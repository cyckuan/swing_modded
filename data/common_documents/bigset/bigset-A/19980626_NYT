JUDGE VOIDS GOVERNOR'S ACTION O GAMBLING 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A California judge Thrsday voided a gambling
agreement that had been set up by Gov. Pete Wilson without
legislative approval or the support of state Indian tribes, who
argued they would lose much of their revenue because of the
compact's restrictions on slot machines.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor has the authority to negotiate but not bind
California without prior constitutional or legislative approval,''
Judge Lloyd Connelly of Sacramento County Superior Court said in
his ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great victory for native Americans in California and
it's a great victory for the Legislature,'' said state Sen. Richard
Polanco, a Los Angeles Democrat and a plaintiff in the case. ``I'm
a very, very happy legislator right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson said in prepared statement that the ruling ``will have no
practical effect'' because currently pending before the Legislature
is a bill to ratify the compact. The bill has already passed the
Senate and is supposed to be voted on by an Assembly committee on
Monday and a final vote could come within the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``This lawsuit was an effort to preserve the tribes' illegal
gaming,'' the governor said in a statement. ``They will not
succeed.'' He also said he planned to appeal the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute centers on the compacts that the 1988 federal law
requires tribes and states to negotiate before casinos can operate.
Last March, the governor signed an agreement with the Pala Band of
Mission Indians _ a small tribe with no gambling _ that greatly
restricted gaming. Saying the agreement should be the ``model'' for
every California tribe involved in gaming, Wilson demanded that all
tribes either sign the Pala Band compact or shut down their casinos
while negotiating another agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Four tribes and five state legislators took the governor to
court, saying he alone did not have the authority to enter into the
agreement. A contingent of tribes went to Washington earlier this
month to plead their case as an issue of sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   Even though gambling is estimated as being a $500-million-dollar
industry in the state, most of the 39 gambling tribes have not
signed the Pala compact, and in the governor's view, are operating
illegally.
</P>
<P>
   The tribes say that the compact's restrictions on the type and
number of slot machines they can use would cost them about 85
percent of their revenue _ money they say is needed to begin the
long climb out of decades of poverty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully the governor and the Legislature will go back to the
drawing board and come up with a compact that is acceptable to the
majority of tribes and not just one,'' said Scott Crowell, a lawyer
who represented the tribes and the lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   But like the governor, the tribes are not just relying on the
courts to protect their interest. They are expected to spend
millions of dollars on a November ballot initiative that would
supersede the Pala compact and give them more control over their
casinos. On the other side, gambling interests in Las Vegas, which
industry experts say may get as much as 30 percent of their
revenues from California, are expected to spend millions of dollars
to defeat the measure.

<P>
   XIAN, China _ With the pageantry of thundering drums and
clanging gongs, President Clinton was welcomed to China on Thursday
night, the first American president to visit this country in nearly
a decade, and he mildly rebuked critics in Washington who have
attacked his policy of engagement with the Beijing government.
</P>
<P>
   ``There may be those here and back in America who wonder whether
closer ties and deeper friendship between America and China are
good,'' the president said, speaking as much to his audience at
home as to the throngs of Chinese who poured into the streets of
Xian on Thursday to give Clinton a tumultuous welcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, the answer is yes,'' the president said. ``We can
learn much from each other. And as two great nations, we have a
special responsibility to the future of the world. The steps we
take over the next week can lead to far greater strides for our
people in the years ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   [On Friday morning, the president met with some of the residents
of a nearby village to ``understand how people live at what we call
the grass-roots level.'')
</P>
<P>
   The 30-minute arrival ceremony was a made-for-TV spectacle for
both the Chinese and American audiences, replete with warriors in
Tang dynasty costumes, a score of maidens in flowing white gowns
bearing baskets of flowers and yellow-robed riders astride
strutting horses. Red paper lanterns hung from the lampposts, and
bright silk banners bearing images of mythical birds of good
fortune flapped in the breeze on a mild smoggy night.
</P>
<P>
   The crowds of factory workers, students, bankers and public
officials began vying for position at 9 a.m. on the sidewalks
around the square before the old city's South Gate, where the
president gave a short speech nearly 12 hours later. By evening,
the crowd extended for two miles down South Avenue out of the
square.
</P>
<P>
   Still two days away from the formal part of his trip, a one-day
summit conference with President Jiang Zemin in Beijing, Clinton
did not dwell here on any of the major, substantive differences
between China and the United States. Instead, he offered brief,
general remarks that stressed the positive aspects of the way the
Chinese-American relationship has developed since 1989, the year in
which President George Bush visited China and the Chinese
government used military force to crush pro-democracy protests in
Tiananmen Square.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his diplomatically indirect reference to the
political climate in the United States about China, recently
inflamed on Capitol Hill over questions about illegal campaign
contributions and the spread of nuclear weapons, Clinton offered a
gentle reminder of the gulf between the two countries on matters of
human rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Respect for the worth, the dignity, the potential and the
freedom of every citizen is a vital source of America's strength
and success,'' the president said as People's Liberation Army
searchlights played in the sky above him. ``In this global
information age, where both economic growth and individual
opportunity are based on ideas, a commitment to providing all human
beings the opportunity to develop their full potential is vital to
the strength and success of the new China, as well.''
</P>
<P>
   In Beijing, U.S. officials complained to the Chinese government
on Thursday over reports that several dissidents had been detained
and others harassed in connection with President Clinton's state
visit. [President Clinton repeated this complaint in his remarks on
Friday morning.)
</P>
<P>
   But in Xian, which the White House chose for the first stop
specifically because it is a city without strong political
symbolism in modern times, the focus was on ceremony and on the
city's undeniably enthusiastic welcome for Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The president and Hillary Rodham Clinton, showing the effects of
their 18-hour, 10,000-mile journey from Washington, made their way
down 150 yards of red carpet to the base of Xian's floodlit South
Gate, part of the fortifications that once guarded the city,
China's imperial capital for more than 1,000 years.
</P>
<P>
   Xian's mayor, Fang Xichu, officially welcomed ``your excellency
Mr. President and Mrs. President,'' and presented Clinton with a
key to the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't it a delight when friends visit from afar?'' Fang said,
quoting Confucius.
</P>
<P>
   The South Gate, also known as the Gate of Eternal Tranquillity,
was built in 1317, 400 years after the end of the Tang dynasty, a
period many Chinese regard as a high point in their civilization.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd in the large square facing the gate numbered only a
few hundred, limited by security concerns. But thick throngs lined
the route of Clinton's 50-car motorcade into the city from the
airport.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it was a moment to be savored for many in the crowd, a
break from the routine and a sign of China's growing acceptance as
a weighty world player.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've lived here more than 20 years and I've never seen as many
people gathered for anything before,'' said Chang Yingxiao, a
division chief in the Xian health bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Chen Tong, a 13-year-old boy came to the parade route to see
Clinton's car, and, perhaps, catch a glimpse of the president
himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I very much like President Clinton, I even worship him,'' he
said. Asked if he held any other Americans in such reverence, the
boy answered, ``George Washington and Michael Jordan.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Controversy has raged in the United States over Clinton's
nine-day, five-city trip to China. Nearly a third of the members of
Congress had urged Clinton to delay the trip until charges of
illegal Chinese contributions to the 1996 Democratic campaign and
the transfer of missile technology to China had been resolved. Many
human rights advocates object to his rewarding the Chinese
government with a state visit while thousands of political
dissidents remain jailed.
</P>
<P>
   But The president's aides aides have hoped to use the trip to
project an image back to the United States of a prospering,
striving China that poses new challenges for economic competition,
not nuclear or ideological confrontation, and Clinton struck that
tone from the first moments of his visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here, in this city famous for calligraphy, a new chapter in
China's story is being written,'' he said. ``We Americans admire
your accomplishments, your economy, your hard work, creativity and
vision, your efforts against hunger and poverty, your work with us
on peace and stability in Korea and South Asia.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``I believe both Chinese and Americans aspire to many
of the same things: to provide for our families, to teach our
children, to build our communities, to protect our Earth, to shape
our own futures and pass brighter possibilities on to our
children.''

CALIFORNIA'S CLASHING HOME PRICES, AFFORDABILITY A STUDY IN
CONTRASTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREGORY J. WILCOX  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Illustrating the yin and yang of California's
real estate market, home sales and prices keep climbing but the
state's major cities, especially Los Angeles, remain among the
nation's least affordable places to live.
</P>
<P>
   So conclude two studies released Thursday that reinforce what
has become a familiar theme: The state is an expensive place to buy
a home or rent an apartment, and with demand rising more quickly
than supply, that won't change any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the number of home sales in the state jumped 19.4
percent from the May 1997 level while the median price, the point
at which half the homes sold for more and half for less, jumped
10.5 percent, said the California Association of Realtors.
</P>
<P>
   It means that if sales proceeded at May's clip throughout the
year, escrow would close on 646,470 single-family homes. Sales
increased 6.6 percent on a month-to-month basis.
</P>
<P>
   Last month's median price was $204,440, up from $185,010 in May
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Most local markets reflected the statewide trend.
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles, the median price last month was $186,580, up 7.9
percent, while sales increased 16.6 percent. In neighboring Ventura
County, the median price was $239,230, up 11.5 percent, while sales
increased 30.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economic renaissance which has been going full force in
Northern California is now boosting nearly every area of the
state,'' said Leslie Appleton-Young, the association's vice
president and chief economist.
</P>
<P>
   But for every upside there is a downside.
</P>
<P>
   For example, at the current sales rate it would take 4.4 months
to deplete the supply of homes on the market compared with 6.9
months a year ago. That kind of statistic eventually could act as a
brake on sales, and a short supply tends to drive up prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will continue to put pressure on housing prices,''
Appleton-Young said of the shortage.
</P>
<P>
   Prices in Los Angeles have always been high compared to most of
the nation's other metropolitan regions, which makes it one of the
least affordable places to live.
</P>
<P>
   This year, as it did in 1997, Los Angeles ranked 73rd among
metropolitan areas for housing affordability, according to Ernst &AMP;
Young Kenneth Leventhal. Only New York and San Francisco were more
expensive, the study said.
</P>
<P>
   That means that in Los Angeles, where the median income for the
family of a midlevel executive was $49,800, owning a home or
renting an apartment chewed up 37 percent of the family's income.
</P>
<P>
   For inexpensive housing, head for Oklahoma City, the most
affordable place to live, according to the study.
</P>
<P>
   Locally, the housing market isn't expected to get any more
affordable, said Alan Horwitz, an audit partner at Leventhal's Los
Angeles real estate group.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the increase in jobs and the increase in demand for
housing . . . and the lack of land (to build on), you will have
continued price appreciation,'' he said, ``and an increase in the
cost of owning a home.''
</P>
<P>
   Ted Gibson, chief economist for the California Department of
Finance, said that since the state's population is expected to hit
50 million by 2020, up to 250,000 new housing units --
single-family homes, condominiums and apartments -- should be built
annually to accommodate that growth.
</P>
<P>
   About 120,000 units now are being built annually, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You do have to take into account we've just had one of the
wettest winters on record,'' Gibson said. ``But the market is
telling us that people are out there buying and there is a
developing shortage of product.''

POLICE NO LONGER SEALING OFF PARKS IN DRUG RAIDS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MICHAEL COOPER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The New York City Police Department has stopped the
practice of sealing parks during drug raids and keeping law-abiding
citizens from leaving them. The change in policy came to light
Thursday, as the city settled a lawsuit brought by a professor who
was briefly detained and handcuffed during a sweep in Washington
Square Park last summer.
</P>
<P>
   The man who filed the lawsuit, Lloyd McNeill, 62, an associate
professor at Rutgers University, had tried to leave the park, where
he had been sitting on a bench with a group of senior citizens when
police began a raid on June 19, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   It was 5:20 p.m., McNeill said Thursday, and he had a 5:30
appointment a few blocks away with a graduate student who was
scheduled to defend her thesis.
</P>
<P>
   But McNeill found that he could not leave the park because all
the exits were blocked by police barricades set up to help police
officers and federal agents carry out a drug sweep that led to 58
arrests.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking, `Why would they inconvenience all these people
who are not part of the drug world?' '' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When he tried to leave, McNeill said, a police officer told him,
``If you come around that barrier, I'll handcuff you and arrest
you.'' But McNeill said that he went around the barrier anyway, and
was quickly handcuffed and briefly detained in a patrol car before
a higher-ranking officer freed him.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later the New York Civil Liberties Union filed a
lawsuit on behalf of McNeill in U.S. District Court in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Norman Siegel, the executive director of the civil liberties
union, said that McNeill agreed to settle the case after the Police
Department issued new guidelines that keep officers from sealing
parks.
</P>
<P>
   The new guidelines were put forward on May 8 in a memo which
stated that when police close off portions of parks, at least one
exit is maintained for those who wish to leave.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the settlement announced Thursday, McNeill received a
$10,000 award and payment of his legal fees.

CLINTON LEADS SCHOOYARD DISCUSSION GROUP
</HEADLINE>
  
 (With CHINA-CLINTON)   (sw) 
 By JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   XIAN, China _ President Clinton led a schoolyard discussion on
Friday in Xiahe, about 30 miles east of Xian and adjacent to the
famed archeological site of the terra cotta warriors buried in the
tomb of Emperor Qin Shihuang.
</P>
<P>
   The president heard from a carefully selected group of citizens
of Xiahe and nearby towns: a schoolteacher, a clinic worker, a
restaurant owner and the manager of a factory that produces
souvenir replicas of the terra cotta warriors.
</P>
<P>
   The president listened intently, asking whether government
policies had led to growing prosperity in the village and
elsewhere, the level of education in the area and the challenges of
running a small business in the booming Chinese economy.
</P>
<P>
   He also took questions. A restaurant owner asked the president
why he was holding such a discussion.
</P>
<P>
   ``For two reasons,'' the president answered. ``First of all, I
think it's important for people in positions like mine, in the
United States and China, understand how people live at what we call
the grass-roots level and understand how the policies we make
affect the way people live and the lives of ordinary citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   He continued, ``And secondly, because the American people are
very interested in learning more about the Chinese people as a
result of my trip. So when we do this there will be pictures and
reports of this meeting in America so people just like you in
America will have a feeling for what it's like to be a teacher or
run a restaurant or work with old people.''
</P>
<P>
   Next on the itinerary for the Clintons is a tour of Emperor
Qin's tomb. &QL;

METS TOP ORIOLES, 3-2 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With derogatory Yankee chants in the air and 35,156
fans on hand, there was a festive mood at Shea Stadium on Thursday
night as a prelude of sorts to this weekend's bragging-rights
showdown with the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   And the Mets did not disappoint as, in the ninth, Carlos Baerga
blooped a two-out single to give them a 3-2 victory over the
Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   Hideo Nomo did not disappoint, either, as he turned in perhaps
his strongest outing since the Mets acquired him from Los Angeles
on June 4. The Japanese right-hander allowed two runs and four hits
in seven strong innings, while walking two and striking out eight.
</P>
<P>
   Nomo was even more dominant than he had been in Florida two
starts before, when he held the Marlins to four hits over six
scoreless innings. And still, Nomo _ who has not won since May 25
and has yet to win as a Met _ departed on Thursday night with the
Mets trailing by a run.
</P>
<P>
   But Mike Piazza, who was booed by some in the fifth when he left
a runner on third base, drove home Wayne Kirby, who had tripled as
a pinch-hitter for Nomo, with a sacrifice fly in the seventh to tie
the game.
</P>
<P>
   Two innings later, Edgardo Alfonzo drew a leadoff walk off the
Baltimore closer, Armando Benitez (2-2). After Luis Lopez and
Piazza both struck out, Baerga came through with his single to
center field, the Mets' ninth hit of the game, one in each inning,
and their first in 10 at-bats with runners in scoring position.
</P>
<P>
   It brought home the winning run. Now it's bring on the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   The victory was the fourth in the last five games for the Mets
(42-32) and their third in a row over the struggling Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   The comeback made a winner of Dennis Cook (3-2), who pitched two
scoreless innings in relief of Nomo, who entered Thursday night's
game with 50 walks in 802/3 innings, the fourth-highest total in
the National League.
</P>
<P>
   Some believe his lack of control this year might be attributable
to a multidirectional instability _ or looseness _ that was
detected in the Japanese right-hander's shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   But General Manager Steve Phillips has said that Nomo's right
shoulder is sound and Manager Bobby Valentine said that it has long
been known that Nomo had the instability in both shoulders, dating
back to arm trouble he had in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The same doctors who examined him when he first came here and
every year since have proclaimed it to be the same,'' Valentine
said. ``Laxity will give you impingement, which manifests itself in
pain. I don't know how it deals with control.''
</P>
<P>
   Nomo, Valentine said, has not felt any pain. And the only
control problems that Nomo had on Thursday night _ when he threw 69
of his 103 pitches for strikes _ came when the Baltimore starter
Scott Erickson was at the plate. Erickson drew both of Nomo's
walks.
</P>
<P>
   One came back to haunt Nomo.
</P>
<P>
   With one out in the fifth, Erickson walked on a full-count
pitch, after Nomo had inexplicably fallen behind 3-0 on a pitcher
who has rarely batted in the majors.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets were trailing by 1-0 because of a line-drive
inning-opening home run in the fourth by Roberto Alomar that
ricocheted off the foul pole in right.
</P>
<P>
   After Nomo struck Brady Anderson out on three pitches following
Erickson's second walk of the game, it looked as if Nomo would be
able to extricate himself from the jam.
</P>
<P>
   But Nomo's third pitch to Joe Carter went about 10 feet over
Piazza's head for a wild pitch, as Erickson took second.
</P>
<P>
   Carter then blasted a 3-0 offering over Brian McRae's head in
center field.
</P>
<P>
   McRae appeared to get a bad jump on the ball, which one-hopped
over the fence for a ground-rule double. Erickson scored from
second and the Orioles led, 2-0.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets battled back for a run in their fifth after Erickson
walked Alfonzo with one out.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Franco's triple to right center made it 2-1, which was
where it stood when the Mets batted in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine sent Kirby up to pinch-hit for Nomo. Kirby responded
by tripling over Carter's head in right.

<P>
   One out and one hit batsman later, Piazza drove Kirby home with
a sacrifice fly. And even though the Mets could not finish off the
rally and perhaps give Nomo the victory, they at least spared him
the indignity of another defeat.

U.S. VOLLEYBALL TEAM SHOWS POSITIVE SIGNS IN LOSS

<P>
   DALLAS _ Don't get Mick Haley wrong. Winning is always nice. It
just isn't always the objective.
</P>
<P>
   Last night, Haley, the coach of the United States women's
national volleyball team, didn't get the win, falling three games
to one to Canada at the Dallas Convention Center, but he got what
he wanted most _ a good look at a group of young players hoping to
win a chance to try out for the 2000 Olympic team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our starters aren't here,'' said Haley, who coaches the Texas
Longhorns in the fall. ``This team is a bunch of young kids who
haven't played together before. We don't expect them to be smooth.
But you get a chance to see how they play under pressure and get a
feel for who can do it and who can't.''
</P>
<P>
   The result was a sloppy and disorganized performance from the
opening serve, as the Americans fell behind 11-2 en route to
dropping the first game 15-5. They followed with their only surge
of the night, blasting out to an 11-1 lead in game two only to
watch the Canadians reel off 12 consecutive points to tie the game
at 14 before the U.S. finally put it away.
</P>
<P>
   From then on it was all Canada, with undersized-but-powerful
outside hitter Bridget Soucy leading the charge as the Canadians
closed out the match with 15-13 and 15-12 victories.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though we lost, I think the second game was the important
one for us,'' said Canada coach Doug Reimer, whose team lost, 3-0,
to the U.S. on Wednesday in Tulsa, Okla., and played the Americans
again Saturday in Sacramento, Calif. ``When we came back from so
far behind, it reminded us we can play.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At that point we said, `Look, this is it,''' said Soucy, a
1996 Olympian who joined the Canadian team last week after her
professional team in Italy ended its season. ```This is our match,
and we're going to take it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Haley got a chance to see some of his players react to
adversity. Several made good impressions, notably former Penn State
star Terri Zemaitis, who finished with 11 kills and team highs in
blocks (six) and attack percentage (.400).
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all new to this, so it's kind of fun,'' Zemaitis said.
``We're all getting a chance to play and we know some of us are
going to get a chance to do bigger things.''
</P>
<P>
   But there was as much confusion as there was stellar play for
the Americans. Haley started a different lineup last night than he
played in Tulsa, and tried various combinations of players all
night in an attempt to find chemistry and to see as many players as
he could.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone did something pretty good at times, but we had our
problems,'' Haley said. ``Basically, we want to give these kids a
chance to show us what they can do.''

SONIC DRAFTEE WILL, IN TIME, RISE AND SHINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The local angle on the NBA draft shaped up as such a
non-event that when he was announced as the Sonics' first-round
draft selection, Vladimir Stepania was half a world away, dead
asleep.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, the Sonics didn't even know until almost the last
moment Wednesday that they were taking him, so the Vladster could
hardly be faulted.
</P>
<P>
   If both parties were mutually bewildered, you should have seen
the knot of reporters gathered around a speakerphone in the press
room of KeyArena preparing to interview the European star.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with a sketchy NBA biography and a scratchy international
connection, an early question was mandatory: Where are you?
</P>
<P>
   ``Where?'' he said, struggling with the nuances of English. ``In
bed.''
</P>
<P>
   After the laughter faded, and the Sonics made a couple of more
selections, the ennui began to dissipate, too.
</P>
<P>
   Stepania, 21, was in Treviso, Italy, at a basketball camp, and
the Sonics were in the middle of changing a non-event to an event
to a happening.
</P>
<P>
   Choosing a sniffling Texas teenager as well as a UCLA reject
allegedly booted for smoking dope, Sonic risk-taking hadn't
inspired as much draft intrigue since 1989. That's when then-club
president Bob Whitsitt took Dana Barros, a too-short shooting
guard, and Shawn Kemp, a too-wild teenager who couldn't stick at a
college.
</P>
<P>
   But the guy who can make the 1998 draft a turning point in club
history is Stepania. A 7-footer ``highly skilled'' in the sport,
according to club personnel hound Billy McKinney, who had seen him
play in person five times, Stepania needs only to bulk up before
stepping out in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   Given his youth, the remaining year on his pro contract with a
team in Ljublijana, Slovenia, and the impending NBA lockout,
chances are he won't play until after next season.
</P>
<P>
   But if he eventually creates a Toni Kukoc-like impact with the
Sonics, fans can thank a friendship connection that might be among
the weirdest in draft history.
</P>
<P>
   As draft day approached, the Sonics were sufficiently smitten
with Stepania to consider trading up to get him. Then their
pre-draft projections indicated he could fall to Seattle at the
27th pick. But beyond his basketball skills, the Sonics knew so
little that team president Wally Walker fired off an urgent call
the morning of the draft to an old friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was in a rush to get some information on the kid,'' said
Bob Walsh, the Seattle sports entrepreneur with extensive business
ventures in Russia and its breakaway republics. Walsh immediately
called an old friend in Washington, D.C.: Tedeo Djaparidze,
ambassador to the United States from the republic of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Not the Georgia of Scarlett O'Hara, Ted Turner, Ray Charles and
clueless Olympic bus drivers. This is the Georgia of Genghis Khan,
Eduard Shevardnadze, the Black Sea and Caucasus Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   The ambassador called Tbilisi, the Georgian capital and the
Stepania family's hometown, where he sought an old friend: the
basketball coach who tutored Stepania since the age of 6.
</P>
<P>
   From Tbilisi to Washington to Seattle, Stepania's character
reference came back: smart, hard-working, solid citizen, eager for
a shot at the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ambassador is a huge fan of the NBA,'' Walsh said. ``I
went with him to the All-Star Game in Cleveland in '96 when they
had the 50th anniversary team, and he was thrilled to meet Bill
Russell and Lenny Wilkens. He recited all their stats and awards.
As a boy in the Soviet Union of the 1950s and '60s, he and his
friends used to get NBA games on illegal broadcasts on Voice of
America.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd been telling me for two years about this kid, but I
hadn't followed him.''
</P>
<P>
   Walsh said it wasn't surprising that the ambassador was so
familiar with what would seem an obscure moment for an
international diplomat. Georgia has a population of about 5
million, nearly a third of which is in Tbilisi, ``so everybody
knows everybody, and most are related.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia became a sovereign state only in 1991, after nearly 200
years of Soviet and Russian rule, so anything or anyone who gains
some international notoriety for a young nation becomes known
quickly to all. In fact, the ambasssador's 14-year-old son has
played some low-key streetball with Stepania.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh said Stepania's father is an architect of Georgian descent
and his mother is a native Russian involved in national sports
organizations. The kid speaks six languages, and by playing for the
past two years in the Yugoslavian league, he's well over
homesickness and well into worldliness.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics compared his skills to those of Alvan Adams, a 6-9
high-post center of the 1970s-era Phoenix Suns, when new Sonic
coach Paul Westphal was an All-Star guard. But in his media chat,
Stepania was as bluntly honest as George Karl.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this moment, I don't feel that I can help,'' he said. ``If
I improve in one or two more years, I feel I have the chance to be
a good NBA player.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no hurry. With such young draftees as Rashard Lewis and
Jelani McCoy, not to mention the NBA lockout, the Sonics can give
Stepania a year to get out of bed.

KEYSTONE MARINERS RESUME SWOON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM STREET  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ So much for a prolonged Mariner winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   It's two and start over. Maybe.
</P>
<P>
   After winning back-to-back games for the first time in almost a
month, the M's on Thursday resumed their June Swoon with a 6-0 loss
to the San Diego Padres before 32,626 fans at Qualcomm Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   On a day starter Ken Cloude pitched well enough to end a
personal two-month winless streak, Padres left-hander Mark Langston
teased the Mariners with breaking pitches and changeups, tricked
Cloude into an inning-ending double play on a bunt, and was bailed
out of his only predicament when reliever Donne Wall induced
Glenallen Hill to bounce into a first-pitch double play with the
bases loaded in the sixth inning.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego led by three runs at the time and presented another
microcosm of things that have gone wrong this season.
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, manager Lou Piniella said, ``I've seen things
this year that I've never seen before in baseball and we still have
July, August and September.''
</P>
<P>
   After the game, Piniella said, ``The senility of the manager is
in doubt.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners saved their worst for last.
</P>
<P>
   Although a four-run deficit may not have been erased, it became
a six-run gap in the eighth inning during another defensive
collapse. Two catchable balls were flubbed so badly that the
batters were credited with hits.
</P>
<P>
   Leadoff hitter Carlos Hernandez lofted a routine fly ball to
left-center. For some unexplainable reason, neither center fielder
Ken Griffey Jr., an eight-time Gold Glove winner, nor left fielder
Glenallen Hill, who doesn't have any _ for good reason _ called for
it.
</P>
<P>
   Hill ran to his left. Griffey sprinted to his right. Hill backed
off at the last second, and the ball fell to the grass.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither one of us called for it,'' Griffey said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he's close to the ball, I concede,'' Hill said.
</P>
<P>
   To make matters worse, and the Padres' lead larger, Hill
misplayed a ball Quilvio Veras hit, turning it into a two-run
double.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I catch the ball, it's a good play,'' Hill said. ``If I
miss it, I'm the goat. I guess I'm the goat.''
</P>
<P>
   Cloude, standing several feet away in front of his locker,
wondered what it's going to take to win a game. The right-hander's
record dipped to 3-7 and he hasn't won since April 24.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I pitched that poorly, but I keep pitching just
well enough to lose,'' he said. ``It is very frustrating.''
</P>
<P>
   Cloude found himself in a two-run deficit right off the bat.
</P>
<P>
   In the first inning, Steve Finley pulled a down-and-in fastball
past first base for a one-out double and Tony Gwynn doubled to
left-center. Ken Caminiti blooped a run-scoring single to right
field with two outs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once he got past the first inning, he did a nice job,'' said
Piniella of his starting pitcher. ``But Langston pitched better.''
</P>
<P>
   Langston, a hard-thrower earlier in his career, relied on soft
stuff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I threw a lot of breaking pitches for strikes and changed
speeds,'' the former Mariner said. ``Everything worked.''
</P>
<P>
   Langston also used his savvy.
</P>
<P>
   With Russ Davis on first base and one out, Cloude popped a bunt
into the air. Langston, noticing that Cloude wasn't running,
allowed the ball to drop. First baseman Wally Joyner picked it up
and started an inning-ending double play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been waiting my entire career to do that,'' Langston
said, smiling. ``Actually, I was going to pick it up and throw to
first, but Wally was there first and he made a great play.''
</P>
<P>
   Cloude learned the hard way that you run everything out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not as concerned about that (play) as much as I am about
my pitching,'' he said. ``It has been over two months since I won a
game and that's not fun. Losing gets old real quick.''
</P>
<P>
   But so does botching scoring opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Langston wobbled in the sixth inning when Alex Rodriguez and
David Segui singled and Jay Buhner walked, loading the bases with
one out.
</P>
<P>
   Hill, batting a decent .286 this season with runners in scoring
position, smacked Wall's first pitch directly to the pitcher, who
snared the ball and started a home-to-first double play.

L.A. TRANSIT AGENCY'S NEW BUDGET PILES DEBT ON TOP OF DEBT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ERIC MOSES  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- The MTA's board of directors adopted a $2.5
billion budget that adds $378 million in debt the agency's chief
executive called necessary for it to recover financially.
</P>
<P>
   ``The MTA will have to borrow to meet the region's
transportation needs in this upcoming fiscal year and in my view in
the next, at least several fiscal years,'' said Julian Burke, CEO
of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not overburdened with debt,'' Burke told the board
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   After nearly an hour of discussion about the agency's debt,
board members voted 8-0 to adopt the budget. Absent were county
Supervisors Gloria Molina and Don Knabe and Mayor John Fasana of
suburban Duarte. Supervisor Michael D. Antonovich and Councilman
Larry Zarian of suburban Glendale left early.
</P>
<P>
   Also approved were county Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky's proposals
aimed at limiting how much the agency can borrow in the future. One
requested a ceiling on debt, and another asked that all future
budget documents indicate which projects are funded by borrowed
money.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing wrong with debt'' as long as there are
controls in place, Yaroslavsky said. ``We do it at the county
(level). We do it in our home mortgages.''
</P>
<P>
   As it is, the agency has no policy to guide its borrowing. Burke
said he is drafting a debt policy to rectify that situation.
</P>
<P>
   In November, the Daily News reported that the MTA would go broke
within a decade if it continued to build rail lines downtown and in
suburban Pasadena and to East and West Los Angeles. And even if the
MTA halted all new rail construction, it would face a serious
deficit for years to come, according to a comprehensive review of
the agency's finances.
</P>
<P>
   Burke called in January for a moratorium on construction of rail
lines to Pasadena, the Eastside and Mid-City.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday he told the board that the MTA still must borrow
$233 million for existing rail projects in the upcoming year,
including $60 million to fulfill a contract to buy train cars for
the shelved Pasadena Blue Line, $84 million for the Hollywood
subway and $33 million for the North Hollywood subway line.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the 1998-99 year, Burke said, the debt will rise
to $4 billion. With the repayment of principal and interest spread
out over three decades, the total cost to the agency will be $6.8
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Burke defended the practice of borrowing as necessary to get the
agency through its current ``growth sequence'' and to finish the
Metro Red Line to North Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   About 30 percent of the MTA's operating budget, or $349 million,
is earmarked for repayment of old debts in the coming year.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan, the MTA board's chairman,
said the agency was saddled with the debt by limitations the
federal government attached to federal money for subway projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was flawed policy where we've gotten way too little for way
too much,'' he said. ``Maybe accepting federal money was wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   The MTA still is waiting to hear whether the Federal Transit
Administration will approve Burke's financial recovery plan and how
much federal money it will receive next year. The agency has
requested $100 million for rail and $25 million to buy new buses.
</P>
<P>
   After the meeting, bus-rider advocates assailed the MTA board
for ignoring the demands of riders who claim the agency is not
complying with the terms of a federal court order requiring it to
alleviate bus overcrowding.
</P>
<P>
   Bus Riders Union organizer Eric Mann blasted the new spending
blueprint as ``another rail budget.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They are talking about billions again in money they don't have
to continue building the rail system because the answer is, `We
have to finish what we started,' '' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The budget provides funding for 83,000 more bus service hours,
the delivery of 111 new buses and money to buy 50 more.
</P>
<P>
   Mann contends the MTA must add 1,600 new buses at a cost of $1.1
billion in the next two years, and his group is considering asking
the judge to require that the agency find the money to accommodate
the more than 90 percent of its customers who ride buses.
</P>
<P>
   Mann, however, accused the MTA of violating a Civil Rights Act
provision that requires transit agencies to spend money on buses in
an amount proportional to the number of riders. This budget failed
to do that, he said, adding that no one on the MTA board seemed to
care.
</P>
<P>
   ``There wasn't one minute today when somebody said, `How much do
we owe the Bus Riders Union?' '' he said.

LEWIS READY TO MAKE SONICS BETTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RONALD TILLERY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ He held up a Sonic uniform in an atmosphere not unlike
the one Shawn Kemp found when he arrived in Seattle. But Texas prep
star Rashard Lewis' skills are mostly compared to the NBA's Scottie
Pippen and Robert Horry.
</P>
<P>
   And before deciding to skip college for the NBA, Lewis took a
little advice from Los Angeles Lakers phenom Kobe Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   A day after the leap from preps to the pros became reality,
Lewis revealed no regrets. Instead, the 6-foot-10, 18-year-old
displayed the confidence that one day he will become Pippen, Horry,
Kemp and Bryant sewed together _ an NBA megastar.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a hard worker and I'm going to bring a lot of excitement.
I think I can make Seattle a better team for years to come,'' said
Lewis, who arrived in Seattle on Thursday after becoming the
Sonics' 32nd pick in the second round of Wednesday's NBA draft.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis was one of three high school athletes taken in the draft.
Indiana liked the NBA-caliber size of New Jersey prep star Al
Harrington, and chose him ahead of Lewis with the 25th pick. But
Lewis is considered the most skilled of the teenage bunch.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis' slender frame is compensated mostly by his scoring
ability, ballhandling, rebounding and athleticism. He needs to get
stronger to make a big impact in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Seattle really knows how good he can be. He's
very developed. I expect him to be in the NBA for a long time,''
said Carl Poston, Lewis' Houston-based agent, who also represents
Horry and Orlando's Anferenee Hardaway.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis became a high school legend at Alief Elsik High School in
Alief, Texas, a Houston suburb. Not only did a plethora of college
scouts attend each of his games, but at least one NBA scout also
sat in the stands.
</P>
<P>
   Juanita Goodman, Lewis' mother, recalled the family home turning
into a political campaign headquarters. Her phone rang constantly.
If it wasn't a college recruiter on the line, Lewis was being given
advice on what to do.
</P>
<P>
   Goodman eventually allowed her son to make his own decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was on his heart. That's what he wanted to do,'' said
Goodman, who has three other children _ Ricky, Kiah and Kirsten.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're raising children, it's always go to school and get
an education,'' Goodman said. ``But I told him to do what was on
his heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis knew he was turning pro the day he returned from Magic
Johnson's All-Star game in Detroit. The April event featured the
top prospects from across the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Lakers were in town to play the Pistons, and Adidas
sponsored the game so Kobe Bryant (an Adidas client) came to the
banquet,'' Lewis said. ``He told me to follow my heart. That meant
a lot to me knowing that (Kobe) made the jump.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, like Bryant, easily could have gone to college with
freshman eligibility. He scored a 20 on his ACT _ 17 is the minimum
required _ but eventually turned down Florida State, Kansas and
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis was visibly disillusioned when the Houston Rockets passed
on him with three picks in the first round. Thursday, though, Lewis
was more than satisfied with his secret admirer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very surprised (when the Sonics made the pick). After
thinking about it, I'm happy I'm here in this situation,'' said
Lewis, who hopes to spell Detlef Schrempf and Vin Baker at times,

YANKEES SHOUT OUT BRAVES, 6-0 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In the hour after pitching his perfect game May 17,
David Wells insisted his newfound prominence in baseball history
wouldn't change him. He was wrong, it seems. He's become a better
pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   With the heat index well over 100 degrees here, Wells sweat
rivers and shut out the Braves on six hits here on Thursday night,
6-0, becoming the fourth American League pitcher with 10 wins this
season. Wells also hit a single in four at-bats, as the Yankees
(53-19) won for the third time in their four games with Atlanta,
which has the National League's best record.
</P>
<P>
   ``You feel like you can play with the best in the game,'' said
the Braves' Chipper Jones, ``and you've just been taken out behind
the woodshed and given a nice beating.''
</P>
<P>
   Having taken Atlanta, the Yankees now invade Shea Stadium for
three games with the New York Mets. Tino Martinez, the Yankees'
star first baseman, was hit by a pitch in the eighth inning on
Thursday night on almost the exact same spot where Baltimore's
Armando Benitez hit him May 19, and Martinez likely will be
replaced by Jorge Posada at first base.
</P>
<P>
   Wells struck out five, didn't walk a single batter for the third
straight start _ he's gone 29 innings since his last walk _ and
reduced his ERA to 3.92. ``I've never seen Boomer this confident,''
said David Cone, referring to Wells by his nickname. ``I don't know
whether that's because of his perfect game, but it seemed to have
an effect on him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's made his mark in history, in Yankee lore, and that means
a lot to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Mel Stottlemyre used to be the pitching coach for the Mets, and
he's currently the pitching coach for the Yankees. ``No one was as
locked in as Dwight Gooden in 1985,'' said Stottlemyre, ``but David
is as locked in as that.''
</P>
<P>
   Wells pitched his second complete game, in spite of the brutal
conditions that forced him to retreat for the air-conditioned
clubhouse and guzzle water between innings. ``About a gallon,''
said Wells.
</P>
<P>
   His idol is Babe Ruth and dressed in a grand style the Bambino
might've appreciated on Thursday night. His back left pocket
flapped inside out from his pants, a square of white drumming
against the uniform gray as Wells walked. The top three buttons of
his jersey were undone, so that the NEW and YORK were turned down.
A hint of a goatee surrounded his mouth. He was a good ol'
fashioned ballplayer, a weekend warrior.
</P>
<P>
   Wells tugged at his jersey constantly, fidgeting throughout,
coming to bat for the first time in the third inning. Denny Neagle
had retired the first eight Yankee hitters, but Wells, with an
exaggerated pigeon-toed finish to his swing _ like the Babe _ lined
a single through the left side of the infield, only the second
regular-season hit by a Yankees' pitcher since 1972.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Knoblauch worked Neagle to a full count, and with two out,
Wells broke from first. Knoblauch fouled off Neagle's pitch, and
Wells slowly trudged back to first. Wells broke from first again
with the pitch, again Knoblauch fouled the ball off. Wells was
wearing down quickly. Ozzie Guillen, Atlanta's shortstop, yelled to
Wells, ``If he hits about three of those, you're dead.''
</P>
<P>
   But Knoblauch flied out to end the inning, and Wells returned to
the mound after being toweled off by the trainer Gene Monahan and
had his most efficient inning.
</P>
<P>
   Neagle allowed just one hit in the first four innings but lost
command in the sixth, walking Knoblauch, and with a full count, he
walked Derek Jeter. Nobody out, runners on first and second. Neagle
ran the count deep on Paul O'Neill, three balls and two strikes. As
Neagle began his motion, Knoblauch broke from second, Jeter
following from first.
</P>
<P>
   And O'Neill slammed a line drive into right-center field, the
ball rolling to the wall, the merry-go-round of Yankees'
baserunners spinning wildly, Knoblauch and Jeter scoring, O'Neill
sliding awkwardly into third base, his feet in the air like a funny
car. Tim Raines singled home O'Neill and Chad Curtis homered,
giving the Yankees a 5-0 lead and finishing Neagle.
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre and Joe Torre, the Yankees' manager, wondered if and
when Wells would finally wilt. Stottlemyre wanted to go to the
mound in the sixth, to give Wells a breather, and Wells waved him
back testily before he was two steps out of the dugout: Don't come
out here.
</P>
<P>
   Leading off the seventh, Wells turned on a fastball and drove it
to deep right field, the players on the Yankees' bench rising to
see if the Boomer had pulled a Babe. But Gerald Williams hauled in
the drive just short of the warning track, and Wells staggered off
the field, pausing at third base to say to Chipper Jones, ``I never
want to come back and pitch here.''
</P>
<P>
   He kept going, though, feeling somewhat faint. Ramiro Mendoza
warmed up and was ready to pitch the seventh, the eighth, the
ninth. But in the dugout, Wells said to Torre, ``Might as well go
out there for the ninth.''
</P>
<P>
   His legs cramped up during the final inning, Wells said, and he
thought about calling Torre out, for relief.
</P>
<P>
   But he kept going and finished, with the same stuff that Joe
Girardi said made him fun to catch: Good fastball, great curveball
and change-up, terrific location, the same stuff that's made him
just about perfect for more than a month now.

SUSAN MCDOUGAL FREED BY FEDERAL JUDGE  
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Susan McDougal, the embattled Whitewater figure who
suffered incarceration rather than answer grand jury questions
about Bill and Hillary Clinton, was unexpectedly freed from prison
Thursday by a federal judge in Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives wept as Mrs. McDougal offered a dazed smile at the
decision by Judge George Howard Jr. of U.S. District Court in
Little Rock, after she insisted that her 21 months of imprisonment
had severely aggravated a spinal condition. Saying he was motivated
by ``compassion and mercy,'' Howard reduced her sentence in a
Whitewater fraud case to time served.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still so stunned,'' Mrs. McDougal said when she emerged
from the courthouse 90 minutes later.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't know what to say,'' she exulted, still in her
two-piece bright-orange prison uniform, looking physically wan but
ebullient in spirit. ``I still don't believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   The ruling eliminated the remainder of a two-year prison
sentence she began serving in March for her conviction in the first
Whitewater trial on charges of mail fraud, misapplication of funds
and making false statements. Mrs. McDougal must serve 90 days of
home detention, and still faces charges in Little Rock and
California.
</P>
<P>
   But taking into account the 18 months of separate jail time she
had served for resisting the grand jury investigation of the
Clintons, the judge ruled that she be freed from prison for the
fraud conviction. The judge gave Mrs. McDougal 10 days to settle
her affairs and report to her parents' home in Camden, Ark., where
she will be under electronic surveillance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a much better person today than the one you sentenced,''
Mrs. McDougal told the judge. ``I promise you, you won't be
sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, visiting the village of Xiahe in China, was
asked about Mrs. McDougal's impending release. ``I'm concerned
about her health, and I hope she gets better now,'' he said. ``I
hope the judge's decision puts her in a position where she can get
over her pain and her difficulty.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. McDougal's troubles with the courts and Kenneth Starr, the
Whitewater independent counsel, were hardly ended by the ruling,
because Mrs. McDougal was re-indicted by Starr last month for once
more refusing to answer grand jury questions about the Clintons and
Whitewater. That trial, on charges of criminal contempt and
obstruction of justice, is set for Sept. 28 in Little Rock. Howard
is also scheduled to preside over that case.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, Mrs. McDougal faces an unrelated criminal trial on
July 13 in California on charges that she embezzled $150,000 from
the conductor Zubin Mehta when she worked as his bookkeeper from
1989 to 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Her mother, Laura Henley, indicated that Mrs. McDougal might
spend the night in a Little Rock hotel but was soon expected home
under the judge's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to take her home so bad,'' Mrs. Henley said, beaming
and teary-eyed outside the courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   Through her travail, Mrs. McDougal has maintained a combative
resistance to Starr and his attempts to implicate the Clintons
criminally in the decade-old complex of real estate and political
events known as Whitewater. She stood firm in leg irons and high
heels as she was led off the first time for her silence, and her
supporters opened a Web site (www.stopstarr.org) that portrayed her
as a martyr to prosecutorial zeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Resign and I'll answer all their questions,'' she said
defiantly to prosecutors in her second contempt struggle with
Starr, insisting he had numerous conflicts of interest.
</P>
<P>
   Howard issued his decision after hearing testimony from Dr.
Ronald Fisk, a clinical neurologist at the University of California
at Los Angeles, that Mrs. McDougal was suffering seriously
progressive curvature of the spine and related disk problems that
may require surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's spokesman, Charles Bakaly, noted that criminal contempt
charges were still pending against Mrs. McDougal. ``The judge made
a compassioned decision based on medical testimony to release Mrs.
McDougal, and we respect the judge's decision,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. McDougal has repeatedly rebuffed the independent counsel
team, accusing Starr of bias in his investigation of Clinton's
affairs in his years as Arkansas's governor. In her re-indictment
last month, prosecutors charged that after Mrs. McDougal was
granted immunity and compelled to testify by a federal judge, she
failed to answer questions posed by prosecutors and grand jurors,
contending that the prosecutors were prejudiced.
</P>
<P>
   The questions covered whether Clinton had testified truthfully
at Mrs. McDougal's criminal trial, the nature of Mrs. Clinton's
legal work on behalf of a corrupt Little Rock savings association,
and the Clintons' knowledge of an improperly financed land deal
that was supposed to bail out Whitewater Development Co. in which
they had invested.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would love to answer the grand jury's questions,'' Mrs.
McDougal declared, according to her jury testimony denouncing the
prosecutors. ``But they don't have anyone in here that will take
this investigation where it should go.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors maintain she had no legal basis for refusing to
answer questions central to the investigation. They sought to
cross-examine her about the version of Whitewater events and
denials offered by Clinton in his videotaped deposition at her
trial. Nor would she say whether she had a discussion with Clinton
about an improper loan issued to her in 1986 by David Hale, a
former municipal judge who ran an investment company backed by the
Small Business Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Hale has testified that Clinton, when he was governor, asked him
to issue the $300,000 loan, some of which paid for Whitewater
expenses. Clinton has denied under oath that he knew about the loan
or played any role in obtaining it.
</P>
<P>
   After her release, Mark Barrett, an associate independent
counsel, emphasized that the government had offered no opposition
to Mrs. McDougal's motion to be allowed her freedom on her own
recognizance, pending her next contempt trial.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all her remaining legal problems, Mrs. McDougal was in
high spirits on the Little Rock sidewalk as she tasted freedom for
the first time since September 1996. Her attorney, Mark Geragos,
said, ``Without a doubt it was more than I expected.'' He escorted
her away to ``get her some clothes.''

DOWN UNDER, OR OVER THE TOP?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It's Think Azure Week at Digger Stadium, or
haven't you heard? The dismissals of general manager Fred Claire,
manager Bill Russell and coaches Mark Cresse, Glenn Gregson and
Reggie Smith were just the opening fireworks in Fox's parody of the
annual celebration of all that is time-honored in the organization
formerly known as the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   There's plenty more upheaval where those firings came from. Take
the team name. Dodger sounds too much like codger if you're
Australian Rupert Murdoch, an eccentric man whose Fox Group took
over ownership of the team at the season's start.
</P>
<P>
   The players are under Murdoch's command now. So why not call
them Diggers, after an Australian soldier? Change a vowel here, a
consonant there, and faster than a Raul Mondesi cutoff throw you no
longer will be able to OD on tradition.
</P>
<P>
   The jerseys will have to be altered to accommodate the new
lettering. So why not revamp the color scheme, too? As sure as
lanes clogged with eggshell and eggplant-colored minivans stretch
before you on the way to the ballpark, primary colors are passe.
</P>
<P>
   Blue will do but only if it's the color of the sky, which is the
limit to which the Fox Group will go to remake the team in its
image.
</P>
<P>
   The players should be sweating _ if they aren't already as a
result of their woeful first-half performance _ so make the jerseys
doubleknits, like the ones the late contrarian Charlie Finley once
forced upon his Oakland A's.
</P>
<P>
   Come to think of it, one of Charlie O's day-glo baseballs might
help Wilton Guerrero pick up the ball better at the plate and in
the field, cutting down on both his strikeouts and errors. It's too
bad a few of those can't be dug out of mothballs and flown to L.A.
in time for tonight's start of a three-game series at home against
the Pittsburgh Pirates.
</P>
<P>
   While on the subject of equipment, Murdoch's minions, inspired
by USC's championship run at this year's College World Series, are
reportedly looking into the possibility of switching from wood to
aluminum bats.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, sure, it'll raise a ruckus within the league's ranks, with
Ted Turner undoubtedly leading the rush to discredit the
freewheeling Fox Group. But, realistically, how else is the team
formerly known as the Dodgers going to be able to compete with the
likes of Turner's Atlanta Braves and the division-leading San Diego
Padres?
</P>
<P>
   Desperate times call for desperate measures. That's why
Murdoch's minions also are thinking of summoning some regulars from
Fox's kiddie-cartoon lineup to bolster the team's pitching. It
sometimes works with sitcoms so why not make synergy part of the
overall baseball strategy? A rotation of Candy, Gold, Gorgeous and
Red Ranger surely would be unhittable as the batters wouldn't be
able to stop laughing long enough to take a swing.
</P>
<P>
   Of serious concern to the players formerly known as the Dodgers
are the murals that surfaced this year at the ballpark. There was
one of catcher Mike Piazza, and he was traded. There's another of
pitcher Ramon Martinez, and he's out for the season with a
rotator-cuff injury.
</P>
<P>
   At this rate, the artists ought to consider switching to
washable markers. Or better yet, if it's a little bit of color
that's needed inside the stadium, dispense with the artwork
altogether and plant boxes of wattle blossoms, the national flower
of Australia.
</P>
<P>
   At the concession stands, look for Kangaroo burgers to replace
Dodger dogs any day now. You'll be able to wash them down with
Fosters beer.
</P>
<P>
   And mark our words, the time is near when reliever Scott
Radinsky will both start and finish a game. The Simi Valley High
product will sing the national anthem as you've never quite heard
it before with his punk band Pulley, then trot out from the bullpen
in the bottom of the ninth with one-out, one-on and a one-run lead.
</P>
<P>
   Calling the game from high above home plate will be the X-Files'
Dana Scully, not Vin. You knew it was just a matter of time before
he was ushered out like all the rest, his mellifluous voice
destined to resurface eventually on the daytime cartoon Ninja
Turtles.
</P>
<P>
   At some point, it might get too much, this thumbing of
tradition, and you'll find yourself humming bars from Tommy Roe's
``Dizzy'' even as Tommy Lasorda stands before you, effusing over
some minor-league player who has just been promoted to the team
formerly known as the Dodgers.

INJUNCTION PUTS BILINGUAL STUDENTS' TEST SCORES UNDER WRAPS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TERRI HARDY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- In an 11th-hour ruling, a judge blocked the state
from publishing the scores of bilingual students who took the
Stanford 9 achievement test in English.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco Superior Court Judge David Garcia issued the
temporary restraining order Thursday without explanation -- an
action that could jeopardize the required release of exam data
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   At the Los Angeles Unified School District, the nation's
second-largest, the superintendent immediately halted the mailing
of test results for its limited-English-speaking students, although
some already had been sent.
</P>
<P>
   The district was unsure whether it would go ahead with plans to
release and interpret results of bilingual students at a news
conference planned for Monday, said LAUSD spokesman Brad Sales.
</P>
<P>
   Rich Mason, chief counsel for the LAUSD, said the district would
be ``corresponding our actions to the judge's ruling and watching
the proceedings very carefully.''
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco attorney who sought the injunction said the
ruling protects districts that do not release the scores.
``However, if they wish to release the data, they are free to do
so,'' said Laura Schulkind, an attorney for Ruiz &AMP; Sperow who is
representing the Oakland and Berkeley school districts.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the districts' legal argument, Schulkind contended
that requiring bilingual children to take the Stanford 9 in English
would result in artificially low scores. Those poor results, she
said, would harm both the students and districts.
</P>
<P>
   ``If those children by definition lack sufficient English
skills, then testing their academic ability in English makes no
sense and is discriminatory,'' Schulkind said.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling sent officials in the state Department of Education
scrambling to their attorneys to determine whether any last-minute
appeals can be filed.
</P>
<P>
   And a state spokesman said it was possible that test maker
Harcourt Brace might not be able to weed out the bilingual
students' scores in time for the release of scores on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has thrown a huge monkey wrench into our plans,'' said
Doug Stone, spokesman for the state's Department of Education.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Pete Wilson, who championed the test as way to set a
benchmark to judge gains in student achievement, issued a scathing
statement calling for the state to seek legal action to overturn
the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's action by one judge places a black mark on
California's efforts to fundamentally reform its educational
system,'' Wilson said. ``I have one simple question: What do the
education bureaucrats have to fear?''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Garcia will rule whether the test results should be
withheld permanently. A hearing is set for July 16.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first year that California required the Stanford 9
exam to be given to children in second through 11th grades.
Controversy erupted because all children were required to take the
test in English -- even those in bilingual classes.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco Unified School District was sued by the state
when it refused to give the Stanford 9 to its limited-English
students. A judge ruled in May that the decision was within the
district's rights.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland and Berkeley school districts reluctantly complied with
the state law and gave their students the test, but sought the
injunction. The districts argued that the test data are unreliable
and unfair.

images of angry protesters and nightstick-swinging police officers
in the white enclaves of Charlestown and South Boston, of
saucer-eyed children watching adult violence from their school-bus
windows. For all that historical baggage, however, the Boston
School Committee on Wednesday night is scheduled to take up the
issue of whether to move back toward neighborhood schools,
reopening the old debate despite any trepidation because, backers
of the proposal say, it simply seems time. By Carey Goldberg.

   GM-STRIKE (Flint, Mich.) _ Like a large stone thrown in a pond,
the strikes at two General Motors' parts factories are producing
economic effects that are slowly rippling out across North America.
The first effects were felt immediately in this town when the
strike began, because GM accounts for more than half the employment
and taxes here The next ripples came over the last two weeks as the
company has closed 26 of its 29 assembly plants in North America
and curtailed production at nearly 100 parts factories. Now the
effects are reaching across the country, into communities and
states where the auto industry has been less visible than here in
the industrial Midwest. By Keith Bradsher.

EDITORIAL: A RUSH TO CHARTER REVISION 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, June 26:
</P>
<P>
   The steamy days around the Fourth of July coax most New Yorkers
to slow down, to laze in the park or along the nearest shore. But
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's hastily appointed charter commission is
racing recklessly ahead next week with public hearings on a new
charter for New York City. This is no way to revise the bedrock
document governing city affairs; it is a bad idea being carried out
in a terrible hurry.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor formed the commission three weeks ago and stacked it
with his cronies in a maneuver intended to deflect City Council
Speaker Peter Vallone's own foolish plan for a referendum on Yankee
Stadium. The mayor seems to be championing a new stadium on the
West Side of Manhattan, but the referendum would probably produce a
vote against using public funds for that purpose. So he now wants
to rush charter revision onto the November ballot, a ploy that
would automatically bump any other referendum to the next election.
</P>
<P>
   The maneuver may be clever politics but it is a silly and risky
way to tamper with city governance. The commission's first meeting
_ held secretly as a ``planning session'' _ has already violated
the public trust and does not bode well for the process.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to tell exactly what the commission will do. The
hearing notice mentions changes in land use, procurement, the
budget process, campaign finance, nonpartisan elections and city
offices, including the Public Advocate. Some City Hall officials
want the commission to shut down the advocate's office and the
Independent Budget Office entirely. Both provide independent
assessments that are burrs under the mayor's powerful mantle,
institutional reason enough to keep them both alive.
</P>
<P>
   Given the possibilities for unintended mischief, there is much
to be said for moving slowly when changing the basic structure of
government. The last charter commission took more than two years to
submit a charter to the voters. The mayor's new commission, with
only a summer to complete its work, will allow each speaker at
public hearings only three minutes. It will produce a proposal by
Sept. 1, to appear on city ballots two months later.
</P>
<P>
   We can understand the mayor's urge to use the Charter Commission
to trump an ill-advised referendum on a new Yankee Stadium, a clear
political gimmick to help draw Vallone's fellow Democrats to the
polls. But at this late stage, New Yorkers do not need either
referendum. They will have plenty of other important decisions to
make on election day 1998.

EDITORIAL: PERU'S PRISONERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, June 26:
</P>
<P>
   It is regrettable that Peru's president, Alberto Fujimori, did
not listen to his new prime minister, who suggested that he pardon
and expel Lori Berenson, an American serving a life prison sentence
for her ties to violent Peruvian terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Berenson, a 28-year-old New Yorker, was convicted of treason
in 1996 after a sham trial before a secret military court. She was
not allowed to challenge evidence, cross-examine prosecution
witnesses or call witnesses of her own. President Clinton and Vice
President Gore have asked Fujimori to allow her to be retried, with
appropriate legal safeguards, in a civilian court. She has spent
two years in prison and suffers health problems.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Javier Valle Riestra, a constitutional lawyer and
human rights advocate who has been in office just three weeks,
questioned the fairness of the trial and suggested that her
expulsion would improve relations with the United States. Hundreds
of Peruvian civilians have also been jailed after unfair military
trials. They too should be retried in civilian courts.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori, known for his authoritarian temperament and impatience
with civil liberties, promptly rejected Valle Riestra's proposal.
But it is somewhat encouraging that he also turned down Valle
Riestra's offer to resign. The prime minister, chosen from the
political opposition, is also critical of Fujimori's unwise quest
for a third presidential term.
</P>
<P>
   Valle Riestra's outspokenness is a welcome development. Peru's
democracy was damaged when Fujimori closed its Congress and courts
in 1992. An elected legislature has been restored, but judicial
independence has not, and military abuses of human rights go
largely unpunished. Fujimori should do more than just put up with
Valle Riestra's criticisms. He should act on them, beginning with
the cases of Ms. Berenson and others unfairly convicted by military
courts.

COMMENTARY: WASHINGTON LIVES IN TWO DIFFERENT WORLDS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By FLOYD NORRIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   At one end of Pennsylvania Avenue lies the U.S. Treasury
building. At the other is the Capitol. They are not that far apart
in miles, but they seem to inhabit different worlds. While the
Treasury deals with the threat of financial hurricanes, the
Congress legislates as if there were not a cloud in the sky.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury officials have moved from one crisis to another, all
stemming from the Asian woes. There have been alarms in Thailand,
Korea, Indonesia, Russia and Japan, and there are worries about
China, Hong Kong and Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
   Disaster has been averted, but there are signs of a global
slowdown. Japan's recession is official, and Hong Kong's will be,
as soon as figures for the current quarter are compiled. A World
Bank official talks about regional depression.
</P>
<P>
   That, at least for now, is too harsh a view. But the pain for
many is great, and is spreading. With economic activity on the
decline in what had been the world's fastest-growing area,
commodity prices have been falling. On average, commodities have
lost about a quarter of their value since last fall, but some,
notably oil, have gone down much more rapidly. Oil-producing
countries this week agreed to cut production again in an effort to
prop up prices, but that is unlikely to work, even if producing
countries do not cheat on their production quotas, unless economic
activity in Asia begins to pick up.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout Asia, bankers are wondering why they made loans to
borrowers who cannot repay. Crony capitalism and political pull
explain some of the bad loans, but many can be traced to the
exuberance and assurance that accompanies economic booms, which can
make credit cheap and easy to get. Now the cycle has turned.
Bankers are cautious and international investors are edging out.
``The virulent Asian virus, in the form of capital flight, now has
affected big developing countries like Russia, South Africa and
Brazil,'' says Barton Biggs, Morgan Stanley's chief investment
strategist.
</P>
<P>
   But on Capitol Hill the picture couldn't be prettier. The
American economy is booming and there is a budget surplus. Goodies
are being given to favored constituents, in such forms as a
pork-laden highway bill and cuts in capital gains taxes.
Congressional leaders have agreed that the current low 20 percent
rate should be made available to investors who sell after holding
on for a year, rather than waiting 18 months. But Speaker Newt
Gingrich thinks that is too modest, and wants to cut the rate to 15
percent. At the same time, the rules on retirement accounts are to
be liberalized to make it possible for better-off Americans to
escape taxation after retirement in return for paying some taxes
now.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the Asian problems have had a relatively small, and
mixed, effect on this country. Our exports are falling, and our
trade deficit has soared to record levels because the Asians can't
afford to buy what they used to buy. The manufacturing sector is
starting to feel the pinch. But capital is fleeing to the relative
safety of this country, driving bond prices up and interest rates
down. Fortunately, European economies that had been sluggish when
Asia was booming are now improving. But Europe too is starting to
feel the impact of the Asian woes.
</P>
<P>
   The world's economies and financial systems, for better and for
worse, are more integrated than ever before and it is unlikely that
the American boom and the Asian virus can coexist for long. A wiser
Congress now would be devoting itself to two tasks. First, it would
be looking for policies to try to keep Asia from turning into a
total economic disaster area. Second, it would be trying to husband
resources so that our government will be able to withstand a
slowdown if one comes without having to either raise taxes or sink
into another huge budget deficit.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Congressional leadership seems to be determined to
pursue the opposite course. The bill to provide badly needed funds
for the International Monetary Fund languishes while the tax
breaks, which will be at their most costly in a few years, take
center stage. It would appear that the Capitol is in a different
world from the one the Treasury is working so hard to keep afloat.

ANGELS RUN HOME WITH FREEWAY TITLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ For the Los Angeles Dodgers, their midseason
Freeway Series with the Anaheim Angels was one huge traffic alert.
</P>
<P>
   After getting swept in Anaheim and winning in extra innings on a
night three coaches were shipped out, the Dodgers lost 3-2,
Wednesday in front of 38,254 at Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Dodgers loaded the bases with two outs in the
ninth, Wilton Guerrero struck out against Troy Percival for the
team's fifth loss in six games.
</P>
<P>
   New pitching coach Charlie Hough was introduced to left-hander
Dennis Reyes (0-4), who allowed just one hit through five innings
before falling apart in a three-run sixth. Then Hough, the old
knuckleballer, was forced to watch one of his own, Angels
right-hander Steve Sparks (3-0), butterfly the Dodgers for one run
and four hits over seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   Sparks, signed by the Angels on Feb. 23, lost all eight
minor-league decisions this year before he was called up in
mid-June, almost one year after undergoing ``Tommy John''
reconstructive elbow surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Rich DeLucia took over in the eighth and Percival earned his
24th save by pitching the ninth as the American League West-leading
Angels won for the 20th time in 24 games in June.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't your typical inning for Percival, who allowed a
leadoff double to Raul Mondesi.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Luke, who tied Monday's game with a ninth-inning homer off
Percival, popped out to short. New Dodgers third baseman Adrian
Belre appeared to pop out to end the game, but right fielder Garret
Anderson collided with second baseman Paco Martin for an error,
allowing Mondesi to score.
</P>
<P>
   Percival then walked pinch hitter Jim Eisenreich and second
baseman Eric Young to load the bases. Guerrero fell behind 0-2
before fouling off three pitches, then chased a high fastball for
strike three.
</P>
<P>
   Five hits by the Dodgers was not a particularly strong debut by
new hitting instructor Mickey Hatcher, who replaced Reggie Smith.
Hatcher reclaimed his No. 9, the same number worn by Smith, who
turned down a chance to manage at Triple-A Albuquerque on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers scored their run in the first inning after Young
opened with a single and stole second. It was his 31st of the
season, one short of major league leader Rickey Henderson, who
stole two bases Thursday against the San Francisco Giants.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Castro moved Young to third with an infield out and Gary
Sheffield brought him home with a grounder to short.
</P>
<P>
   Reyes limited the Angels to just one hit through the first five
innings, a Gary DiSarcina single with one out in the third.
</P>
<P>
   Reyes also walked Phil Nevin with one out in the second, but the
Dodgers turned a double play to get out of the inning.
</P>
<P>
   But suddenly in the sixth, Reyes fell apart. After striking out
DiSarcina to open the inning, he walked Sparks. Darin Erstad
followed with a double down the right-field line.
</P>
<P>
   Reyes struck out Dave Hollins to set a career high with seven,
but then walked Jim Edmonds to load the bases. Hough, who pitched
10 years in the Dodgers organization, came to the mound but left
Reyes in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Fielder, who had three hits including a homer Wednesday night,
was next and he walked to force in a run and tie the score 1-1.
</P>
<P>
   That was enough for new manager Glenn Hoffman, who had Reyes at
Triple-A Albuquerque. There, Reyes made six starts (1-4, 1.44)
after failing to make the big club out of spring training.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers, under fired manager Bill Russell and reassigned
pitching coach Goose Gregson, complained that Reyes lacked focus on
the mound.
</P>
<P>
   He displayed that in the sixth, but the inning was just getting
started.
</P>
<P>
   Greg McMichael took over and immediately gave up a ground-rule
double to left by Nevin that scored two runs and gave the Angels a
3-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   That was more than enough for Sparks, who pitched seven innings
and did not allow a runner past second for the final six.
</P>
<P>
   Sparks, who came to the majors with Milwaukee in 1995 after
eight years in the organization, missed all of 1997 after
undergoing surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Although he allowed seven runs in 13 innings during his two
major league starts, he won both against the Texas Rangers, whom
the Angels overtook for the American League West lead.
</P>
<P>
   Like Thursday against the Dodgers, Sparks was shaky in the first
inning of his last start. He allowed three runs, including a
two-run homer by Juan Gonzalez.

RED SOX FEND OFF PHILLIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ The lawyers, guns, and money are never far away,
but for one night, anyway, Bret Saberhagen kept them all at arm's
length, which is about the same way he treated the Philadelphia
Phillies in a 7-5 win Thursday night at Veterans Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Saberhagen, setting aside a domestic dispute that he says has
affected his performance of late, held the Phillies to five singles
and an unearned run in six innings, which went a long way toward
stopping the Red Sox' three-game losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox weren't able to leave town without one last scare from
the pesky Phillies, who scored four runs off Tom Gordon in the
ninth and had the tying run at the plate before Ron Mahay struck
out Bobby Abreu for his first big league save.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess this probably completes my everyday thing, from
hitting to the on-the-mound stuff,'' said Mahay, the converted
outfielder who gave up a two-run single to Mark Parent before
whiffing Abreu.
</P>
<P>
   Saberhagen, who stopped the Sox' six-game losing streak, their
longest of the season, nearly a month ago, had lost his last two
decisions but raised his record to 9-5 despite feeling under the
weather for the last couple of days.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't look healthy but he threw well,'' said Phillies
catcher Parent, who was referring more to Saberhagen's shoulder
than whatever else was ailing the righthander.
</P>
<P>
   At 36, Parent is old enough to have faced Saberhagen when he
dominated, before his right shoulder was recycled. ``Location is
the biggest difference,'' Parent said. ``He used to be able to dot
an ant's butt.''
</P>
<P>
   Saberhagen may lack that kind of precision now, but he still has
enough to squash pests when needed. He was supported by solo home
runs by John Valentin (No. 10) and Damon Buford (No. 5 and third in
36 at-bats this month) and a two-run, two-out single by Darren
Lewis in a three-run seventh fueled by an error by Phillies second
baseman Mark Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   But with Gordon having his worst outing since he gave up four
runs in Atlanta June 8, the Red Sox wound up needing the two runs
they scored in the ninth on a double by Darren Bragg, singles by
Jason Varitek and Mike Benjamin, a wild pitch, and a double-play
grounder by Lou Merloni.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was important that we turned it around tonight,'' said
Lewis, who lined his hit on a 3-and-2 pitch from lefty Matt Beech
after the Phillies starter had struck out Benjamin and pinch hitter
Billy Ashley with the bases loaded.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't like we were playing badly. They've been swinging
the bat well and taking advantage of their opportunities, but it
was crucial for us to get out of it as quickly as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   After being blown out for six runs in four innings by expansion
Tampa Bay in his last start, Saberhagen had admitted to being
affected by child and spousal support issues he is attempting to
resolve with his ex-wife. He said he shares custody of their three
children, but he is seeking a reduction in support payments that he
claims are $85,000 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Talking about it, he said, was a help.
</P>
<P>
   ``It relieved a lot of the stress I had built up,'' he said.
``People on the team, guys were coming up to me saying, `What's the
matter with you? You're not acting like your usual self.' You don't
feel like telling people what's going on.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like I'm trying to cut (the support) off. My three
kids will always be my No. 1 priority and are well taken care of.
Unfortunately, there are a lot of other circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   Saberhagen was cruising along with a four-hit shutout with two
out in the sixth until he unexpectedly encountered an adversary
almost as formidable as his ex-wife's divorce lawyer: the Red Sox
defense.
</P>
<P>
   Third baseman Valentin and first baseman Mo Vaughn committed
errors on consecutive plays. Valentin's throw on Rico Brogna's
bouncer went right through Vaughn's glove, allowing Brogna to
reach. The next batter, Parent, also bounced one to Valentin, who
took his time to measure his throw, then bounced one in the dirt
past Vaughn, Phillies runners ending up on second and third.
</P>
<P>
   Saberhagen, working carefully, then hung a 3-and-2 offspeed
pitch that Abreu whacked into center field for an RBI single,
making it 2-1. Lewis flied to right to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started all that garbage that inning,'' said Vaughn, who
said he lost Valentin's throw in the crowd. ``If that didn't
happen, he's probably still pitching. I just lost it, and the ball
hit the top of my glove. But that play should have been made.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for the Red Sox, the Phillies' defense also turned
generous in the seventh, when Lewis's second error of the night
allowed Boston to build on its lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Phillies played us real tough,'' Vaughn said. ``Guys like
(Scott) Rolen and the rest, they play hard. They're an
up-and-coming team. We needed a win to get back on track.''

ARIZONA SCHOOL STANDARDS CALLED TOPS IN NATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Arizona's new academic standards for children at public schools
are the best in the nation, according to a report released Thursday
by a Washington, D.C., organization that looked at academics
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``More states earned D's and F's than A's and B's,'' concluded
the Thomas B. Fordham Foundation, a private educational research
organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yet . . . at least a few states managed to write magnificent
standards: documents that expect much from students. And three
states _ Arizona, closely followed by California and Texas _ did a
good enough job across the board to earn an honors-level GPA (grade
point average).''
</P>
<P>
   The foundation gave Arizona a B+ composite grade. Its science
standards earned an A, while math and English standards earned B's.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cool!'' said Penny Kotterman, who will be sworn into office
next week as the president of the Arizona Education Association.
``It's quite an honor. Arizona is finally No. 1 in something
related to education.''
</P>
<P>
   The mood also was jubilant at the state Department of Education,
which developed the standards with panels of citizens and educators
before they were adopted by the state Board of Education in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are thrilled,'' said Billie Orr, an associate
superintendent charged with spreading the word about the new
standards and a future high school graduation test based on them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are at the top _ and not even sharing it with anyone. It's
truly incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   Fordham's report called academic standards in many other states
``vague'' and ``hostile to knowledge.''
</P>
<P>
   Three states _ Iowa, Nevada and Wyoming _ were not included in
the study because they do not have a formal set of academic
standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``The national picture is bleak,'' the report concluded.
``Scores of states have spent millions of dollars to create shabby
_ and in some cases utterly useless _ documents.''
</P>
<P>
   Arizona spent about $1.7 million to develop the Arizona
Instrument to Measure Standards or AIMS test _ which is based on
the new standards and which fifth-, eighth-, 10th- and 12th-graders
will take starting next year.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona's science standards were praised for their careful
definitions and specific requirements. For example, Sir Isaac
Newton's laws must be introduced by eighth grade.
</P>
<P>
   The report noted that the science standards have been criticized
by teachers and college professors for excluding the word
``evolution.'' A panel of citizens and educators is revising the
standards to include evolution, Orr said.
</P>
<P>
   Kotterman said she believes Arizona's standards work because
they were developed during a 2{-year process that included input
from panels of teachers, administrators, parents and even
schoolkids. &QL;

IT'S UNANIMOUS: ROSENBLATT BEATS ALLEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LEDYARD, Conn. _ Dana Rosenblatt had to work a full shift
Thursday night, but not for want of trying to get off early.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly 10 rounds, the Malden, Mass., middleweight pounded
the head and body of Arthur Allen as if he were an old throw rug in
need of a dusting. Then the tiring Rosen-blatt suddenly went wobbly
when Allen landed a short uppercut late in the final round that
seemed to momentarily stun him.
</P>
<P>
   By then, he was so far ahead that he needed only to stay upright
to win his fourth straight fight since a 14-month layoff caused by
a hand injury. When he did, judges Fred Ucci and George Smith had
him a 98-91 winner, while Robert Paolino saw it 96-93. The Globe
had Rosenblatt in a 99-92 romp.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenblatt dominated the first four rounds, pounding Allen to
the body and then hooking him to the head until he had bloodied his
right eye and had his mouth hanging open from fatigue. But at the
end of the fourth, Allen got his head into Rosenblatt's face and
gave him a slight cut along the inside of his left brow that was
more of an irritant than a concern.
</P>
<P>
   All along, Rosenblatt's plan was to try to negate Allen's
81-inch reach by getting inside and staying there, ripping body
shots with the surgically repaired right hand that had caused that
long layoff.
</P>
<P>
   Allen finally began to take this one-sided beating personally
late in Round 5. When the bell sounded, he stood nose to nose with
Rosenblatt in a stare-down that carried considerably less
intimidation than the norm because it came after he had lost all of
the fight's first 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   This pattern continued, with Rosenblatt scoring heavily to the
body and often to the head but spending too much time leaning in on
the inside. This caused him to lose his balance on occasion and
prevented him from landing a crisp hook to the head that might have
rendered Allen unconscious.
</P>
<P>
   Allen (23-4) finally did go down late in the eighth from a
crushing left hand but was up at the count of four. Rosenblatt
attacked him wildly but was unable to land a finishing shot. Allen
gamely took his lumps and occasionally fired back to no avail as
the fight dragged on to its 10-round conclusion. The only question
by now concerned what had prompted Allen to stay upright for so
long while being peppered by 123 more punches (302-179) than he
managed to land despite throwing 45 more than Rosenblatt (625-580).
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I had him out in the eighth round,'' said Rosenblatt
(32-1). ``The guy gave me a good fight, but it takes time to get
yourself back to 100 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosenblatt's victory was good news for his promoter, Bob Arum,
who was in need of some because the bad news for him had started
long before the fights did. Arum learned early in the day that
International Boxing Federation welterweight champion Felix
Trinidad had signed a new promotional deal with Dino Duva and
Friday will announce a six-bout deal to fight exclusively on HBO.
Worse for Arum, Trinidad and World Boxing Association champ Ike
Quartey had signed an agreement for a fall meeting. This came even
as Arum was increasing his $3.5 million offer by $1 million for
Quartey to fight World Boxing Council champ Oscar De La Hoya.
</P>
<P>
   In the ring, De La Hoya's next scheduled opponent, Julio Cesar
Chavez, suffered a deep cut over his right eye in the second round
of what was supposed to be a tuneup fight with Ken Sigurani.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a foul,'' said Chavez (101-2-2). ``I was really
(upset), so I went straight for the knockout.''
</P>
<P>
   It came one round later when Chavez nailed Sigurani with a
booming right hand that sent him spinning to the floor. He got up
at the count of four but immediately fell backward into the ropes,
and referee Arthur Mercante Sr. jumped in and stopped the bout at
2:09 of the third.
</P>
<P>
   ``He caught me with a heavy right hand, and that was it,''
Sigurani said. ``He's still one of the great punchers in the
division.''
</P>
<P>
   He may be, but he is also a worn-out one who seems to end up
bleeding after every fight these days, regardless of his opponent.
This time he was cut badly enough that he went immediately to a
local hospital for plastic surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was about an inch and a half long,'' said cutman Miguel
Diaz. ``But he'll be fine for September.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure he will. Until the fight starts.

VAN EXEL KEEPS QUIET ABOUT TRADE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ How does it feel to go from NBA royalty to
the pro basketball dungeon within hours? How does it feel to leave
a team with 61 wins for a team with 11?
</P>
<P>
   Only Nick Van Exel knows for sure and he isn't saying much.
</P>
<P>
   A day after being traded by the talent-rich Los Angeles Lakers
to the rebuilding project known as the Denver Nuggets, Van Exel was
silent Thursday. He did not return phone calls from Lakers
management and wasn't talking to the Nuggets either.
</P>
<P>
   If Van Exel refuses to report to Denver for a physical exam by
Monday afternoon, the trade could be jeopardized, but neither team
sounded concerned Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Agent Tony Dutt declined to say what his client's plans were.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, it's tough,'' Dutt said. ``He liked L.A. I guess he
was more in favor of kind of sticking it out, if he could.''
</P>
<P>
   But Van Exel's employer opted for a change in team chemistry,
giving the Nuggets new hope _ ``an All-Star ... we're going to
build this team around,'' said Nuggets general manager Dan Issel _
while posing new questions for the Lakers, who could turn over
two-fifths of their starting lineup.
</P>
<P>
   With the departure of Van Exel, a fixture at point guard in the
post-Magic Johnson era, the Lakers lose about 15 points and 7.5
assists per game. They also are likely to lose free-agent small
forward Rick Fox, who provided 12.0 points per game and solid
defense this season.
</P>
<P>
   And the team whose greatest self-described weakness was
inexperience actually got !ital!younger!off! Wednesday night by
adding rookies Tyronn Lue, Sam Jacobson and Ruben Patterson and
second-year pro Tony Battie.
</P>
<P>
   If the Lakers opened the season today, third-year guard Derek
Fisher _ solid, but not an All-Star _ would start in Van Exel's old
spot; either underachieving Elden Campbell or Battie _ dubbed ``El
Busto'' by Issel _ would start in the front court, pushing Robert
Horry into Fox's vacancy.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the Lakers probably are not done retooling.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of players on our team now, and a lot of people
talk to us about our players,'' executive vice president Jerry West
said, ``and we think that there's going to be opportunities for us
to do other things, if we feel it's prudent.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing will happen before the NBA's expected lockout begins
July 1. But the Lakers hope once league business resumes, the new
labor agreement might include a new salary cap that lets them
re-sign Fox and, perhaps, a new structure that makes it easier to
deal Campbell and his $7 million salary.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, the picture of the Lakers' offseason efforts to
build a championship team remains fuzzy. The following points of
interest are a bit more clear:
</P>
<P>
   __ Fisher gained the most from the deals, apparently cementing
himself as the starting point guard on an elite team just as he
became eligible for a contract extension. He could profit both off
and on the court.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wouldn't have made the trade unless we were comfortable
with (Fisher),'' West said. ``I think our coaches always felt that
maybe we need a little more experience back there, but Derek Fisher
is the kind of point guard that any coach would like.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Kobe Bryant, also heading into his third year, also up for a
contract extension this offseason, also figures more prominently.
Stuck behind Eddie Jones at off guard, Bryant could end up as the
starting small forward if Fox is gone but otherwise will find more
playing time at point guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to look at the combinations with Kobe and Eddie and
Derek,'' coach Del Harris said. ``There will be a three-guard
combination to start with and we'll work the young guys in, as
we're presently constituted. Perhaps there will be other changes.
If this were our roster right now, that's what I would be
thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   __ The Lakers' free-agent picture also comes into slightly
clearer focus. The arrival of Jacobson, a shooting guard,
eliminates whatever remote chance there was of Jon Barry returning
and makes Shea Seals a long shot. Adding Battie and Patterson could
push Mario Bennett off the roster.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, all the answers might be found in one more major
deal _ Campbell to a team in need of a center and with a starting
power forward to trade. The Lakers concentrated Wednesday on the
Van Exel swap, but a Campbell deal remains a possibility in the
coming months.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think when someone makes a lot of money and certainly
doesn't play a lot of minutes, there's every reason to believe you
want to get a lot more bang for your buck,'' West said. ``But
(Campbell) is an extremely valuable player to us.... We just would
not give him up for a player that would be insignificant.''

ANGELS TAKE CHANCE ON HANSON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.1998 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Anaheim Angels have signed pitcher Erik
Hanson, released earlier this month by the Toronto Blue Jays, and
assigned him to triple-A Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   Hanson, 33, had shoulder surgery last year and began this season
on the disabled list. He was 0-3 with a 6.24 ERA in 11 games this
season for the Blue Jays before being released June 16.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a quality veteran guy, and if he gets his arm in shape
we'll have a guy we might be able to go to, Angels manager Terry
Collins said. ``He can give you those quality innings and he
possesses pretty good stuff. It's a matter of making sure his arm's
in shape.
</P>
<P>
   ``He needed a place to get squared away, Angels general manager
Bill Bavasi said. ``He feels he's down 4 to 5 mph on his fastball.
He wants to go down and pitch for a month.''
</P>
<P>
   !arrow!Decision time:!off! Catcher Todd Greene had his right
shoulder examined by Dr. James Andrews in Birmingham, Ala.
Thursday, and now will have to decide whether or not to have
season-ending surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Greene consulted Drs. Lewis Yocum and Frank Jobe before seeing
Andrews. If he decides against surgery, he could come back this
season to DH and play first base.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not putting the screws to him to do something,'' Bavasi
said, ``but I'd like for him to get a gameplan in motion.
</P>
<P>
   __ In pain: Tim Salmon was unavailable for the third consecutive
game Thursday after receiving a cortisone shot Monday night in his
left foot. Recovery time from a cortisone shot typically takes 48
to 72 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Salmon, limited to DH duty the rest of the season because of a
partially torn ligament in the foot, said the most difficult part
of the injury is mental.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really just getting tired of dealing with it, he said.
``The first question I have getting out of bed is `How's the foot?'
From the time I'm up to the time I go to bed, my whole day is
concerned with the foot. That wears on you. The injury is only part
of the problem. The mental part is the biggest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I already feel I'm letting the team down, not helping the
team.''

CLIPPERS INTRODUCE OLOWOKANDI
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Just a few hundred feet from the future home of
the franchise, the Los Angeles Clippers on Thursday introduced the
future of their franchise.
</P>
<P>
   Center Michael Olowokandi arrived at the Los Angeles Convention
Center, adjacent to the site where construction has begun on the
Staples Center, where the Clippers and Lakers will play basketball
in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Olowokandi couldn't have sounded happier in his first day as a
Clipper.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's big time, coming to L.A.,'' Olowokandi said. ``That's
more or less like a dream come true.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll do whatever it takes to make the team better.''
</P>
<P>
   Olowokandi was accompanied by his parents, Ezekial and Agnes.
His father is a Nigerian diplomat stationed in England. Both
parents got their first glimpse of their son's basketball skills
when they watched a videotape Wednesday morning in the Clippers
offices.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if they wanted their son to leave England to try and play
college basketball, Ezekial Olowokandi responded, ``Not at all. We
stress academics.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They said, `Why can't you play basketball here?''' Michael
said.
</P>
<P>
   Olowokandi has hardly ignored academics, majoring in mechanical
engineering at Pacific. But that will wait, now that he is
guaranteed millions as the NBA's top draft pick, the first European
to claim such an honor.
</P>
<P>
   ``How significant an impact I make remains to be seen,'' a
humble Olowokandi said.
</P>
<P>
   Although he was primarily a track star in England, Olowokandi
said he couldn't resist the lure of pro basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Track got kind of old. I was more exposed to the American
game,'' Olowokandi said. ``We saw highlight films of Magic Johnson
and Michael Jordan. It was something I wanted to be part of.''
</P>
<P>
   Olowokandi was welcomed at the press conference by Clippers
forward Maurice Taylor. The pair have a lot in common, since Taylor
didn't play basketball until he was 16, and Olowokandi did not play
organized basketball until he was 20.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to make my life a lot easier,'' Taylor said. ``If
you asked management, they know who I wanted to pick. We both
started playing basketball fairly late. We both want to win.''
</P>
<P>
   About the only question Olowokandi had trouble answering was how
he felt being on a team that does not have a coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no feelings about that. That's not my job,'' Olowokandi
said. ``That's up to management.''
</P>
<P>
   Although it came as a mild surprise publicly that the Clippers
took Olowokandi over Arizona point guard Mike Bibby, Olowokandi's
agent, Bill Duffy, said the hype of Bibby going No.1 was overblown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that was orchestrated. I think that was a media
campaign orchestrated,'' Duffy said, referring to Bibby's powerful
agent, David Falk.
</P>
<P>
   As for Falk, he was upset Thursday that the Clippers bypassed
his client.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Clippers made a mistake,'' Falk said. ``I think
the Clippers' loss is (Vancouver's) gain. I think Olowokandi will
be a terrific player, but I think that you need somebody directing
and running your team.''
</P>
<P>
   Falk acknowledged that he met Tuesday afternoon with Clippers
owner Donald Sterling, in a last-ditch attempt to get Bibby in L.A.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think as we approach the 21st century for a team like the
Clippers _ and you're moving into a new building with the Lakers _
I think it's more than simply a business decision,'' Falk said.
``It's an entertainment decision. I think with Mike having won a
national championship, he's the best-known player in the draft.''
</P>
<P>
   Although USC coach Henry Bibby is not a candidate for the
Clippers' coaching position, he had hoped to establish a
relationship with his son, with all the talk that Mike would become
a Clippers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was happy that we might be able to get our relationship
where it should be between a father and son,'' Bibby said.
``Hopefully, his mother will let him grow up the way he should and
let him get on with his life and be himself. Hopefully, she will
stay out of his life.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Bibby's mother, Virginia, said she intended to move to
Vancouver to be with her son, and ``we won't have to deal with''
the problems that exist in the family.

SAVARESE DERAILS DOUGLAS'S BID 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LEDYARD, Conn. _ The dream ended with both Buster Douglas and
Lou Savarese on the floor Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Lou Savarese was on his knees in tears.
</P>
<P>
   Buster Douglas was on his back in a fog.
</P>
<P>
   It had taken only 2 minutes 42 seconds for Douglas to fall from
grace, triggering Savarese's celebration of his first-round
victory.
</P>
<P>
   All week, Douglas had looked like a man suddenly old and worn
out. His face seemed gaunt, his belly loose. Though only 38, which
these days seems young for a heavyweight boxer, he appeared to be a
fighter on his last legs.
</P>
<P>
   Not long after the first bell sounded in the Bingo Hall at
Foxwoods Casino, he wasn't even able to stand on those legs, having
been knocked off them by a straight right hand that sent him
toppling to the floor.
</P>
<P>
   One second he was jabbing hard, the way he had the night he beat
Mike Tyson for the world championship eight years ago. The next, he
was drawing that left hand back a little too slowly and crumbling
from a straight right over the top.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watched a lot of film of him,'' said Savarese (37-2, 31
KOs). ``He was dropping his left hand when he jabbed, and I was
looking to come in over the top of his jab.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Douglas got up at the count of four, he was now in the
wrong place at the wrong time. His dream of cashing a
million-dollar check for a rematch with Tyson was turning into a
nightmare of punches he could not stop hitting him in places he
could no longer protect.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Savarese carefully circled at first, searching patiently for
another opening, his heart racing as he watched his clearly wounded
opponent move. Finally, he saw what he was looking for and sent
another right hand to the ear, and Douglas went down again, landing
hard.
</P>
<P>
   Although he got up again, Douglas was now standing in the
executioner's dock, waiting for the hangman. His fate was sealed
when an emboldened Savarese rushed in and fired a flurry of punches
over the former champion's lowered hands, and Douglas fell down a
third time, this time landing face first, as Savarese leaped into
the air.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no three-knockdown rule in an International Boxing
Association title fight, so as Douglas struggled to push himself up
off the canvas once again, referee Steve Smoger informed the
already celebrating Savarese that the party was over.
</P>
<P>
   Or rather, that it hadn't quite started yet.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't take long for it to begin. Before Savarese could leave
the neutral corner to finish the demolition, Douglas righted
himself, only to topple backward in Savarese's corner without
another punch being thrown.
</P>
<P>
   Referee Steve Smoger took one look at Douglas's pile of flesh on
the canvas and didn't even bother to count. The dream was over for
Buster Douglas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I screwed up big time,'' said Douglas (36-6-1), his eyes still
glassy as he spoke minutes after he'd lost what surely seems his
final fight.
</P>
<P>
   With his robe now back around his shoulders and a hood covering
his head, Douglas left the ring and headed back to his locker room.
As he walked, his trainer, John Russell, dealt forthrightly with
the aftermath: ``Maybe it's time for us to go fishing.''
</P>
<P>
   Buster Douglas wasn't heard quarreling with that.

SAVARESE MAKES QUICK WORK OF DOUGLAS

<P>
   MANSHANTUCKET, Conn. _ James (Buster) Douglas and Lou Savarese
came here on Thursday night to reaffirm their standing in the
heavyweight division. It took just one round for Savarese to clear
things up for himself and muddle things for Douglas.
</P>
<P>
   With three blazing right hands Savarese sent Douglas sprawling
to the canvas three straight times in the first round, prompting
Referee Steve Smoger to stop the bout at 2 minutes 34 seconds after
Douglas had wobbled to his feet and had fallen into his corner
following the third knockdown.
</P>
<P>
   The knockout victory earned Savarese (37-2) the International
Boxing Association championship and left him in a sobbing heap on
the canvas. The stunning setback probably sent Douglas (36-6-1)
back into retirement.
</P>
<P>
   John Russell, Douglas' longtime trainer, said: ``He got popped
good. Maybe it's time for us to go fishing.''
</P>
<P>
   Douglas, 38, who knocked out Mike Tyson for the undisputed
heavyweight championship of the world in 1990, had ballooned to 400
pounds and was near death in a diabetic coma in 1994. He lost
weight and regained his desire to box while getting himself in
shape.
</P>
<P>
   The 31-year-old Savarese had not looked this impressive since
his 12-round loss to George Foreman in April 1997. He was knocked
out by David Izon last November and won on a second-round technical
knockout in his last fight, against Jeff Lally on April 23.
Savarese had gone into training with Tim Hallmark, Evander
Holyfield's Houston-base conditioning trainer.
</P>
<P>
   On the undercard, Julio Cesar Chavez took his stroll along the
garden path toward his Sept. 18 bout with Oscar De La Hoya in Las
Vegas, Nev., but it wasn't as smooth as he thought it would be.
Yes, he did beat Ken Sigurani, stopping him on a technical knockout
when Referee Arthur Mercante stopped the fight at 2 minutes 9
seconds of the third round. But it was not without some pain.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez (101-2-2) and Sigurani (22-2) clashed heads in the second
round and the butt opened a cut over Chavez's right eye. Chavez
ended the fight before it could become a bigger problem.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya stopped Chavez on a cut in the very same place in the
fourth round of their 1996 fight. The promoter Bob Arum said
Chavez's eye should heal within a month and that there was no
danger that the fight against De La Hoya would be postponed. &QL;

 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Los Angeles Dodgers' new coaches arrived
Thursday, saying all the right things and promising to bring energy
to the sagging club.
</P>
<P>
   Hitting instructor Mickey Hatcher, pitching coach Charlie Hough
and bullpen coach John Shelby were brought in by new general
manager Tom Lasorda for their blend of personality, championship
experience and teaching ability.
</P>
<P>
   Hatcher and Shelby were key members of the Dodgers World Series
championship team in 1988. Hough, promoted from Class-A San
Bernardino, pitched on three Dodger pennant winners in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charlie is the most knowledgeable pitching coach in the
organization,'' said the outgoing Goose Gregson. ``The team is in
excellent hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatcher, also brought in from San Bernardino, was one of the
most popular players in Dodgers history. But he also was a .280
hitter who became a respected batting instructor during three
seasons as a minor-league manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``Players responded to him and we know they will respond here,
too,'' said Dodgers manager Glenn Hoffman, who served the past two
years as minor-league field coordinator. ``Behind all the fun is a
guy who can teach and understands about patience.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatcher received a huge ovation during the game when one of
clips from his playing days appeared on the left-field video
screen. He greeted Lasorda with a hug in the Dodgers dugout before
the game. ``I'm going to make them all switch-hitters,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Shelby's new job is confusing, to him as well. He was a career
outfielder for Baltimore and the Dodgers but will spend most of his
time in the bullpen. But Shelby also will be responsible for
coordinating the Dodgers pregame batting practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be out there and I'll probably be in the dugout, too,''
Shelby said. ``I think it is a job that will develop as we go
along. It is great to be back here. Tommy said I'd make it back
someday.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Opening day: Adrian Beltre began his major-league career
Wednesday night with an RBI single on the first pitch he faced
against left-hander Chuck Finley.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was great,'' he said. ``I never played in front of a crowd
like that before. But I didn't really feel nervous.''
</P>
<P>
   Beltre, 20, was brought up Monday from Double-A San Antonio,
where he batted 321 with 13 homers, 56 RBI and 20 stolen bases
despite missing 20 games with sore ankles. Beltre also got a hit in
the 11th inning Wednesday but aggravated his left ankle.
</P>
<P>
   ``They still bother me, but I can play through it,'' he said. ``
Maybe they brought me up a little too early, but being here is what
every player lives for. I feel I am ready.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Martinez in Dominican: Ramon Martinez, who will undergo
season-ending shoulder surgery on Tuesday, has returned to his home
in the Dominican Republic.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is very down right now,'' said Dodgers vice president Ralph
Avila, who will play a bigger role in the Lasorda regime. ``But
nobody worked harder last winter when he had the torn rotator cuff.
He will work that way again and I expect him to make a complete
recovery.''

HOOPER'S ROAD   MAP DIRECTS HIM EASTWARD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL SCHLOTTER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lance Hooper had accomplished all he could on West Coast race
tracks. So in 1997, with Winston West and Featherlite Southwest
Tour titles on his resume, he kissed wife Jennifer and daughter
Nicole goodbye and left Palmdale to seek his NASCAR fortune in
North Carolina, the heartland of stock car racing.
</P>
<P>
   Last year was spent making contacts _ shaking hands and saying
yes sir and no sir to as many team owners as possible. Along the
way, he made occasional guest appearances driving on the NASCAR
Craftsman Truck and Busch Grand National series.
</P>
<P>
   This year, he caught a limited Busch Series ride with Richard
Jackson Motorsports.
</P>
<P>
   With his team making only seven of the 15 races so far, Hooper
isn't exactly tearing up the tour in points. He's not ranked in the
top 40. But he was the second-fastest qualifier at June 5's
Hardee's 250 at Richmond International Raceway.
</P>
<P>
   And more important in Hooper's view _ he's getting a racing
education.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm learning a lot,'' Hooper said. ``This is all a stepping
stone to my goal to be in Winston Cup.''
</P>
<P>
   Hooper excelled on the short flat tracks of the West early in
his career. But he found his expertise of scant value on Eastern
circuits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to retrain myself,'' Hooper said. ``Their short
tracks back here are longer than our long tracks out west. And
their flat tracks have more banking than our banked tracks.''
</P>
<P>
   The competition is fierce as well, Hooper said. At any given
race some 50 to 55 cars might show up to qualify for the 36
starting slots. And up to a dozen of the drivers might be Winston
Cup regulars looking to warm up for their race by whipping up on
the Busch drivers.
</P>
<P>
   Thus it was that Hooper was pretty proud of that No.2 start at
Richmond.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt pretty good about that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hooper sees nothing but good things ahead for himself and his
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just got a brand new car,'' he said. ``And we're a young
team and we're growing together.''
</P>
<P>
   The hard part for Hooper is being away from his wife and
daughter. And he is hoping his team can scrape together the funds
to come out west for the Busch tour's July 19 stop at California
Speedway in Fontana.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to get sponsorship for that,'' Hooper said. ``My
wife and daughter are still in Palmdale and I really want to come
out for that race. So if you know of anyone.....''
</P>
<P>
   __ Wedding-bell blues: North Hollywood racer Jeff Shafer and his
girl friend Jolene Wulff have planned for months to get married in
Escondido on July 5 and then spend the next week or so honeymooning
in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Then Shafer got this job driving a race car on the KOOL/Toyota
Atlantic series with Arciero-Wells Racing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sent an invitation to one of the mechanics on my team and
he comes up to me and says, `Hey, you know we're testing in
(Wisconsin) the next day.''' Shafer said. ``I said, `Uh-oh, we're
going to have to resolve this.'''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the resolution was painless _ albeit inconvenient _ and
has Wulff's blessing. The couple's nuptials end at 9 p.m. July 5.
At 10 p.m. they board a plane for Milwaukee, arrive at about 5:15
a.m., then drive an hour and a half to the Road America track in
Elkhart Lake.
</P>
<P>
   After a day of testing Shafer's car, the couple will catch a
plane for Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Shafer said Jolene doesn't mind the detour.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's completely supportive of my career,'' the Grand High
School product said. ``All she said was that she wanted to go with
me to Wisconsin. She didn't want to get married, then stay behind
while I went off to test.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Herta close again: Valencia's Bryan Herta won his second pole
start of the season and finished third at last weekend's FedEx CART
Budweiser/G.I. Joe 200 in Portland, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   It was Herta's second pole of the season and the fifth of his
career.
</P>
<P>
   Herta held the lead three times during the race. But he
encountered a bit of bad luck when his team gambled by taking an
unscheduled pit stop for fresh tires on lap 73 of the 98-lap race.
</P>
<P>
   The plan was to bring Herta in for fresh tires during a yellow
flag, giving him an advantage over eventual winner Alex Zanardi,
who chose to stay on the track. But when the green flag came out to
restart the race, Herta got stuck in traffic while Zanardi speed
off to an untouchable lead.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Herta's third-place finish moved him into fifth
place in season points.

INSATIABLE ISRAEL: STRETCHING JERUSALEM _ AND PATIENCE _ TOO FAR

<TEXT>
<P>
   Of all the Middle East's impossible issues, Jerusalem, it has
long been argued, is best left to the last: once everything else is
sorted out, the irreconcilable may perhaps be reconciled.
</P>
<P>
   True or not, there is no questioning the rider to the
proposition: that high-handed unilateral action to determine the
future of a city that both Israel and the Palestinians claim as
their capital could well destroy any hope of a peace agreement.
Yet, Israel, seemingly deaf to this logic, is once again embarked
on such action.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides promised, when they signed the Oslo peace
agreement in 1993, that the status of Jerusalem would stay
unchanged until they negotiated its future as part of a final
settlement. Strictly speaking, its political status has not
altered.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Israel has used demography. The peace talks were frozen
16 months ago when Israel began building a large Jewish settlement,
Har Homa, in an Arab area.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend, as the Americans struggled to unfreeze the talks,
the Israeli cabinet gave initial approval to a plan that expands
Jerusalem's municipal borders, partly by including (though not
annexing) two Jewish settlements east and north of the city and the
West Bank land between them and the city.
</P>
<P>
   Is there any ``peace process'' still left to save? Making that
question yet more vexed, the Israeli government is considering a
non-binding referendum on America's proposal for a small, staged
withdrawal from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   The charitable view of this poll is that Benjamin Netanyahu,
Israel's prime minister, is seeking popular support to squeeze
acceptance out of his hard-line cabinet. But the American plan,
crucial as it is to getting talks restarted, deals only with one of
the three interim ``redeployments'' that were supposed, under Oslo,
to precede the final-settlement talks.
</P>
<P>
   If a slow-motion referendum has to hold matters up at this
stage, the hopes of pushing on to a realistic, worthwhile
settlement are dim indeed.
</P>
<P>
   Acting on the principle that possession is nine-tenths of the
law, Netanyahu appears to bank on the Palestinians, unequal
partners in the peace process, having no option but to wait quietly
for whatever crumbs the squabbling Israeli government may be
prepared to drop. And they will not get even the crumbs unless they
ensure that no dissident or desperate Palestinian attacks an
Israeli citizen.
</P>
<P>
   This security pledge is intrinsic to the original land-for-peace
bargain. But with limited power over small enclaves of land that
are often cut off from one another, let alone from the outside
world, by Israel's summary border controls, the Palestinians are
growing ever more dissident and desperate.
</P>
<P>
   A recent report by the IMF's Middle Eastern Department reveals
how cruelly economic conditions in the West Bank and Gaza have
deteriorated since peace broke out: by the beginning of last year,
the unemployment rate was 15 percent higher than in 1993, and
income per head 20 percent lower.
</P>
<P>
   These are sour rewards for peace. Yet they would be endurable if
there were genuine hope of better, more independent and more
honorable, times to come. Unfortunately, nothing that the Netanyahu
government has yet offered justifies such hope.
</P>
<P>
   So where will the Palestinians turn? Weaklings compared with the
Israelis, they have two possible forms of pressure. One is force,
albeit suicidal _ in all senses of the word.
</P>
<P>
   They ponder a reprise of the intifada, the uprising in the late
1980s that eventually helped to bring the Israelis to the
negotiating table. A new intifada, it is acknowledged, would be a
grimmer affair: men with arms, not boys with stones.
</P>
<P>
   Or they could turn to world opinion, nearly all of it critical
of Israel, which buttresses, or should buttress, their weakness as
negotiators.
</P>
<P>
   Without America's influence, the Palestinians might already have
been repulsed from the table. But this influence does not extend to
pressing the Israeli government to break a pattern that is steadily
pushing a Middle East peace out of sight. Until it does, the
descent to violence seems ineluctable. &QL;

   Of all the Middle East's impossible issues, Jerusalem, it has
long been argued, is best left to the last: once everything else is
sorted out, the irreconcilable may perhaps be reconciled.
</P>
<P>
   True or not, there is no questioning the rider to the
proposition: that high-handed unilateral action to determine the
future of a city that both Israel and the Palestinians claim as
their capital could well destroy any hope of a peace agreement.
Yet, Israel, seemingly deaf to this logic, is once again embarked
on such action.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides promised, when they signed the Oslo peace
agreement in 1993, that the status of Jerusalem would stay
unchanged until they negotiated its future as part of a final
settlement. Strictly speaking, its political status has not
altered.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Israel has used demography. The peace talks were frozen
16 months ago when Israel began building a large Jewish settlement,
Har Homa, in an Arab area.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend, as the Americans struggled to unfreeze the talks,
the Israeli cabinet gave initial approval to a plan that expands
Jerusalem's municipal borders, partly by including (though not
annexing) two Jewish settlements east and north of the city and the
West Bank land between them and the city.

<P>
   Can a summit that brings together the leader of the world's most
powerful country and the head of the world's biggest emerging power
be anything less than a world-shaping event?
</P>
<P>
   After China's president, Jiang Zemin, visited America last
October, the two sides talked of building a new ``strategic
partnership.'' The backdrop to Bill Clinton's return visit to China
this week would seem to underscore the need for something to
restore stability in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Last month India and Pakistan shook the world with their nuclear
tests. Elsewhere, from Indonesia to Japan, governments are
struggling to fend off ever worse financial woes.
</P>
<P>
   Amid all this, China seems to some to be an island of stability,
perhaps a new economic leader in the region, worthy of a seat at
the G7's top financial table.
</P>
<P>
   Yet nothing much world-shaping, or even Asia-shaping, will
result from Clinton's trip to China. Not least because China is not
up to it.
</P>
<P>
   China is certainly a growing power to be reckoned with in Asia,
and Clinton's visit is an acknowledgment of that. Yet it would be
dangerous to confuse China's sheer size or even its past military
strong-arm tactics _ grabbing reefs in the South China Sea, lobbing
missiles into the sea lanes near Taiwan _ with real influence over
Asia's current problems.
</P>
<P>
   It makes sense for Clinton to engage China where possible: there
are plenty of issues, from weapons proliferation to trade or
environmental problems, that can usefully be discussed at this
summit.
</P>
<P>
   But talk of strategic partnership misrepresents China's attitude
to its role in the world. In many respects, it has yet to decide
whether it will go on being part of the problem or work with others
to find a solution.
</P>
<P>
   That said, China is changing rapidly. Most ordinary Chinese are
freer now than at any time since Mao launched his communist
revolution _ though admittedly that is not saying much.
</P>
<P>
   The Communist Party, nominally in charge of China's economic
reforms, is itself straining to keep pace with the social and
political changes the reforms have brought about.
</P>
<P>
   More and more Chinese can now buy their own apartments, run
their own businesses and, in a few instances (and despite an
overall human-rights record that remains poor), defend themselves
against overweening officials through the courts.
</P>
<P>
   Yet China is still a hugely fragile place, with wrenching
economic changes ahead. If it seems more stable today than
Indonesia or South Korea, that is because it has yet to push
through the tough reforms _ to its debt-ridden banks and moribund
state enterprises _ that are needed to ensure continuing rapid
growth.
</P>
<P>
   As these reforms bite, unemployment, already rising, will get
worse. As social tensions and regional rivalries intensify, the
government may yet lose its nerve and crack down hard, as it did in
1989.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not just China's internal strains that prevent it
playing partner to America, or indeed anyone else, in Asia. China
is still a revisionist power, unhappy with the territorial status
quo, and often reluctant to accept international rules that in its
years of Mao-led seclusion it did not help to write.
</P>
<P>
   For example, China still considers Taiwan a mere renegade
province. Its missile firings and military maneuvers near the
island two years ago were a brutal attempt to intimidate voters
before Taiwan's first fully free presidential election. It backed
off only when America sent two aircraft carriers to extend a
protective arm to the island.
</P>
<P>
   Having gone so close to the brink of conflict, rather as America
and the Soviet Union did after the Cuban missile crisis of 1962,
America and China sensibly declared a truce and set out to
stabilize their relations. But their differences run deep.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, China has recently been mending fences in Southeast
Asia, where its earlier reef grabs had caused widespread alarm. Yet
it has not given up its claim to vast tracts of ocean there _ and
the resources that are presumed to lie under them.
</P>
<P>
   China did make a welcome, if modest, contribution to the rescue
packages put together by the IMF to help cope with the first bout
of financial turbulence in East Asia.
</P>
<P>
   It has since made much of its refusal to devalue the yuan (which
might set off another damaging round of currency instability in the
region, harming China too), contrasting its ``restraint'' with
Japan's delay in boosting its economy to take some of the strain
off its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, arguably, China's earlier devaluation contributed to last
year's problems for the region's smaller economies. For all its
foot-dragging over domestic reform, Japan has done, and will be
doing in future, far more than China ever could to keep its
troubled neighbors afloat.
</P>
<P>
   It is not that China and America cannot do business together,
just that the nature of the business they can usefully do is still
limited. China wants to join the World Trade Organization, so as to
defend itself against protectionist measures taken by others, yet
is unwilling so far to drop enough of its own restrictions on
foreign business activity in China.
</P>
<P>
   Getting China into the WTO is a worthwhile goal, but, as America
and others point out, only on sensible terms.
</P>
<P>
   China wants respect as a great power, yet has been slow to take
on the responsibilities that go with the rank. Through its contacts
with North Korea, it has helped to stabilize the Korean peninsula
(having earlier opposed sanctions on North Korea for breaking the
Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty).
</P>
<P>
   China itself signed the NPT only in 1992. More recently, it
tightened regulations on the sale of nuclear technology abroad. Yet
Chinese firms do not always obey these rules. And anyway much
damage to the non-proliferation cause had by then been done, some
of it by helping Pakistan's nuclear program.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Indian and Pakistani nuclear tests, China has
cooperated diplomatically with America and others in calling for a
cap on the arms race that is now likely to follow. Yet China is
loth to take the initiative in building confidence by being more
open about its own nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile it continues to provide missile technology to unstable
parts of the world, including the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   So, for all the talk of partnership, there is much that divides
America from China, and indeed China from most of its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Occasions like this week's summit offer a good chance to talk
over such differences _ not least because for many years yet a
rising China will have a greater capacity to do harm in Asia,
rather than good. But do not expect miracles. &QL;

to its role in the world. In many respects, it has yet to decide
whether it will go on being part of the problem or work with others
to find a solution.
</P>
<P>
   That said, China is changing rapidly. Most ordinary Chinese are
freer now than at any time since Mao launched his communist
revolution _ though admittedly that is not saying much.
</P>
<P>
   The Communist Party, nominally in charge of China's economic
reforms, is itself straining to keep pace with the social and
political changes the reforms have brought about.
</P>
<P>
   More and more Chinese can now buy their own apartments, run
their own businesses and, in a few instances (and despite an
overall human-rights record that remains poor), defend themselves
against overweening officials through the courts.
</P>
<P>
   Yet China is still a hugely fragile place, with wrenching
economic changes ahead. If it seems more stable today than
Indonesia or South Korea, that is because it has yet to push
through the tough reforms _ to its debt-ridden banks and moribund
state enterprises _ that are needed to ensure continuing rapid
growth.
</P>
<P>
   As these reforms bite, unemployment, already rising, will get
worse. As social tensions and regional rivalries intensify, the
government may yet lose its nerve and crack down hard, as it did in
1989.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not just China's internal strains that prevent it
playing partner to America, or indeed anyone else, in Asia. China
is still a revisionist power, unhappy with the territorial status
quo, and often reluctant to accept international rules that in its
years of Mao-led seclusion it did not help to write.
</P>
<P>
   For example, China still considers Taiwan a mere renegade
province. Its missile firings and military maneuvers near the
island two years ago were a brutal attempt to intimidate voters
before Taiwan's first fully free presidential election. It backed
off only when America sent two aircraft carriers to extend a
protective arm to the island.
</P>
<P>
   Having gone so close to the brink of conflict, rather as America
and the Soviet Union did after the Cuban missile crisis of 1962,
America and China sensibly declared a truce and set out to
stabilize their relations. But their differences run deep.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, China has recently been mending fences in Southeast
Asia, where its earlier reef grabs had caused widespread alarm. Yet
it has not given up its claim to vast tracts of ocean there _ and
the resources that are presumed to lie under them.
</P>
<P>
   China did make a welcome, if modest, contribution to the rescue
packages put together by the IMF to help cope with the first bout
of financial turbulence in East Asia.
</P>
<P>
   It has since made much of its refusal to devalue the yuan (which
might set off another damaging round of currency instability in the
region, harming China too), contrasting its ``restraint'' with
Japan's delay in boosting its economy to take some of the strain
off its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, arguably, China's earlier devaluation contributed to last
year's problems for the region's smaller economies. For all its
foot-dragging over domestic reform, Japan has done, and will be
doing in future, far more than China ever could to keep its
troubled neighbors afloat.
</P>
<P>
   It is not that China and America cannot do business together,
just that the nature of the business they can usefully do is still
limited. China wants to join the World Trade Organization, so as to
defend itself against protectionist measures taken by others, yet
is unwilling so far to drop enough of its own restrictions on
foreign business activity in China.
</P>
<P>
   Getting China into the WTO is a worthwhile goal, but, as America
and others point out, only on sensible terms.
</P>
<P>
   China wants respect as a great power, yet has been slow to take
on the responsibilities that go with the rank. Through its contacts
with North Korea, it has helped to stabilize the Korean peninsula
(having earlier opposed sanctions on North Korea for breaking the
Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty).
</P>
<P>
   China itself signed the NPT only in 1992. More recently, it
tightened regulations on the sale of nuclear technology abroad. Yet
Chinese firms do not always obey these rules. And anyway much
damage to the non-proliferation cause had by then been done, some
of it by helping Pakistan's nuclear program.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Indian and Pakistani nuclear tests, China has
cooperated diplomatically with America and others in calling for a
cap on the arms race that is now likely to follow. Yet China is
loth to take the initiative in building confidence by being more
open about its own nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile it continues to provide missile technology to unstable
parts of the world, including the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   So, for all the talk of partnership, there is much that divides
America from China, and indeed China from most of its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Occasions like this week's summit offer a good chance to talk
over such differences _ not least because for many years yet a
rising China will have a greater capacity to do harm in Asia,
rather than good. But do not expect miracles. &QL;

   BORDELONVILLE, LA. _ In the rain-thirsty cotton fields of
central Louisiana, a series of green plastic cones, hoisted on
poles, stand among this season's newly planted shoots.
</P>
<P>
   They are traps, marking the sites where state officials check
the progress of their latest pest-control program: a chemical
massacre of the boll weevil.
</P>
<P>
   If all goes well, the traps will also mark the end of an era:
the final defeat of the mightiest insect around.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to destruction, nothing compares to the weevil,
which hopped from Mexico to Texas in 1892, and into Louisiana soon
after that. With its protruding snout and stunted wings, the boll
weevil looks part beetle, part aardvark, and has no natural enemies
in the American South.
</P>
<P>
   As it worked its way slowly across the region, ravaging cotton
fields and ruining cotton farmers, it radically changed the
economy.
</P>
<P>
   It brought a diversification of crops, helped the study of
pesticides, and speeded the northward migration of black farm
workers.
</P>
<P>
   Cotton, though hurt, survived: it is still one of Louisiana's
chief agricultural products, second in value only to timber. But
many farmers long ago converted their fields to safer, less
lucrative crops, such as soybeans and corn.
</P>
<P>
   And, thanks to the weevil, the 5,000 state farmers who still
produce cotton must drench their fields with chemicals up to 20
times each year.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, the federal government has studied the boll weevil,
hoping to destroy it. In the late 1970s, researchers unveiled a
five-year program that actually seems to work.
</P>
<P>
   It has the ambitious title of Boll Weevil Eradication. Its
weapon is a chemical called malathion, which must be sprayed on
every cotton plant, on every cotton field, in a given cotton
region.
</P>
<P>
   Every farmer in the region must agree to take part and to share
the cost, about $150 per acre. That price has been the program's
chief stumbling block, in Louisiana and elsewhere, says Frank
Carter, head of pest management at the National Cotton Council.
</P>
<P>
   One by one, though, other states have done it _ nine in all,
most in the Southeast. The first few got help from the federal
government, Carter explains. But then the federal money ran out.
</P>
<P>
   When Louisiana's farm leaders tried to start a statewide program
a few years ago, only the wealthiest farmers, from the western and
central parts of the state, joined in.
</P>
<P>
   Their program, now in its second year, covers 10 percent of the
state's cotton crop, and blends old-fashioned crop-dusting with
space-age technology.
</P>
<P>
   Last autumn, satellites tracked the crop-dusting aircraft,
ensuring that the malathion was evenly spread. This spring,
scanning machines recorded the number of weevils in traps, to
decide where more spraying will be needed.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the results are astounding: the traps show no weevils
in places where before there would have been hundreds.
</P>
<P>
   But there are lots of cotton farmers in the northeast of
Louisiana. If they do not destroy the bug, they soon will not be
able to compete.
</P>
<P>
   Weevil-free states can now produce cotton more easily and
cheaply: from 1987 to 1995, Georgia's cotton production grew from
250,000 to 1.5 million acres. And the neighboring states depend on
Louisiana's cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   Boll weevils easily cross state lines, so Arkansas and northern
Mississippi cannot have eradication programs until Louisiana's is
complete.
</P>
<P>
   This spring, state officials sought a way to subsidize the
program. Their idea was to cut the cost to farmers in half by
financing boll-weevil destruction with gambling money.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-boll-weevil operation was put into a bill to set up
slot machines at some horse-racing tracks. The backlash against
gambling's expansion killed that measure, but it stood a chance: in
Louisiana, Bible country is also cotton country, and many righteous
lawmakers were willing to put their convictions aside for the
farmers' sake.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the boll-weevil money was found from other bills. If
farmers approve the plan, eradication will start next autumn. And,
in a few years, the once-potent bug will be reduced to a curiosity,
a piece of state history, folklore and song.
</P>
<P>
   Louisiana's Senate ended its session this year by playing a
boll-weevil song by Fats Domino, a native of Louisiana. The
senators danced and bounced around, some rejoicing in a victory
over gambling, some bidding adieu to the insect invaders. Either
way, it was a jubilant goodbye. &QL;

LUNGREN-DAVIS: TWEEDLEDEE AND TWEEDLEDUM OF CALIFORNIA POLITICS

 c.1998 Economist Newspaper Ltd.  
 (Distributed by the New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are few things that Californians like to boast about more
than their state's diversity: you can hear more than 70 languages
spoken in California's schools; you can see more than 600 religions
practiced in its churches and temples; and you find such exotic
mixtures as spaghetti and curry or pizza and sushi served in its
restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   But when it came to choosing candidates for the state's
governorship, on June 2, Californians seem to have shown about as
much appetite for diversity as the people of Utah.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Lungren, the Republican candidate, and Gray Davis, his
Democratic rival, are the Tweedledum and Tweedledee of American
politics.
</P>
<P>
   They are both lawyers-turned-politicians, both in their 50s and
both Roman Catholics. They were both touched deeply by the war in
Vietnam _ Lungren as an armchair hawk and Davis as a decorated
officer.
</P>
<P>
   They are both hard-liners on such emotive issues as
flag-burning, the three-strikes law and the death penalty. They
have both had plenty of experience as legislators and executives.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, Lungren is California's attorney-general, which
makes him both its chief policeman and its chief lawyer. Davis, on
the other hand, is currently the state's lieutenant-governor, which
is rather like being a neutered version of the vice-president.
</P>
<P>
   All of which ought to be good news for the Republicans, who have
held the governorship for the past 16 years. The economy is as
successful as it has been in a generation, with the state's gross
annual product passing the trillion-dollar mark and its treasury
brimming with a $4 billion surplus.
</P>
<P>
   Serious crime has fallen by a third on Lungren's watch. Add to
this the fact that Lungren was all but unopposed for his party's
nomination, whereas Davis had to slog it out with two free-spending
rivals, and you have a strong case for sticking with Tweedledum
rather than risking Tweedledee.
</P>
<P>
   And yet Lungren is far from being a shoo-in for the
governorship. The Democrats have long had more registered voters
than the Republicans (currently 47 percent of the electorate
compared with 35 percent).
</P>
<P>
   In the past four elections they have squandered this advantage
by choosing candidates who were either too exotic or too
inexperienced to win over the suburbs; but Davis's very
Tweedledeeness could play well there.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans are also much exercised by their poor showing
among Latinos, who now make up 12 percent of the state's voters, up
from 7 percent six years ago. This is indeed dismal: Bob Dole
managed to get a mere 6 percent of the Latino vote, compared with
Ronald Reagan's 45 percent in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   But an even bigger problem for Lungren will be his ability to
sell his hard-edged brand of conservatism to the broad middle
class.
</P>
<P>
   California is a relatively moderate state, free from the
strident moralizing that flourishes in the South. (Bureaucratic
moralizing is another matter: witness the state's absurd ban on
smoking in bars.)
</P>
<P>
   Reagan combined his enthusiasm for the free market with a
laissez-faire attitude to personal morality. Pete Wilson, the
current governor, is one of the Republican Party's leading
advocates of abortion choice.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Riordan, the popular Republican (and Catholic) mayor of
normally Democratic Los Angeles, has preserved an impeccably
liberal stance on what Californians like to call ``lifestyle
issues.''
</P>
<P>
   But Lungren is an altogether more ideological figure, a close
ally of Newt Gingrich, a leading author of the ``Contract with
America,'' a supporter of school vouchers and an outspoken opponent
of abortion.
</P>
<P>
   He spent three years, and much soul-searching, before deciding
to join 37 other states in suing the tobacco companies. He has
repeatedly been accused of blunting the impact of the state's ban
on assault rifles.
</P>
<P>
   Davis thus has plenty of material for portraying his rival as a
Newt Gingrich in Tweedledum's clothing. On the abortion issue in
particular, he will be able both to unite his own fissiparous party
and drive a wedge between fiscal and social conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   Lungren has done much to soften his image in recent months,
particularly among Latinos. He won 17 percent of the Latino vote in
the primary, and has taken to advertising on Spanish-language
television _ a first for Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   He opposed the proposition that killed bilingual education,
joined the Democrat-driven suit against Microsoft and now
emphasizes that, as governor, he will be able to do little about
abortion. He has done as much to distance himself from Wilson as he
can without risking a public rift.
</P>
<P>
   But the chances are still high that the Democrats will be able
to demonize Lungren in the run-up to November, not least because,
in his heart of hearts, he is a conviction politician.
</P>
<P>
   This could well be bad news for California. For all his social
conservatism, Lungren is an advocate of a lot of things _ notably
school vouchers _ that could help to galvanize California's
moribund public sector, whereas Davis is little more than a
cat's-paw of the trade unions.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the presence of a Republican governor has acted as a
valuable check on the ambitions of the Democratic legislature. The
state's Chamber of Commerce calculates that dozens of
``job-destroying'' bills have never got past the mere threat of
Wilson's veto.
</P>
<P>
   Lungren's defeat, should it come to that, will be even more of a
blow to the Republican Party, both locally and nationally. The next
governor will play a leading role in redrawing the boundaries of
California's 50-plus congressional seats, a process that could
decide the balance of power in Washington for a generation.
</P>
<P>
   And Lungren is the most impressive Republican the state has
produced since Reagan: a man with deep roots in the party (his
father was Richard Nixon's campaign physician) but with a nice
populist touch (his performances as the lead singer in his rock
band, Elvis and the Lawmen, are reported to be impressive).
</P>
<P>
   If he cannot sell today's brand of radical Republicanism to the
country's largest state, then nobody can. &QL;

<P>
   There are few things that Californians like to boast about more
than their state's diversity: you can hear more than 70 languages
spoken in California's schools; you can see more than 600 religions
practiced in its churches and temples; and you find such exotic
mixtures as spaghetti and curry or pizza and sushi served in its
restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   But when it came to choosing candidates for the state's
governorship, on June 2, Californians seem to have shown about as
much appetite for diversity as the people of Utah.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Lungren, the Republican candidate, and Gray Davis, his
Democratic rival, are the Tweedledum and Tweedledee of American
politics.
</P>
<P>
   They are both lawyers-turned-politicians, both in their 50s and
both Roman Catholics. They were both touched deeply by the war in
Vietnam _ Lungren as an armchair hawk and Davis as a decorated
officer.
</P>
<P>
   They are both hard-liners on such emotive issues as
flag-burning, the three-strikes law and the death penalty. They
have both had plenty of experience as legislators and executives.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, Lungren is California's attorney-general, which
makes him both its chief policeman and its chief lawyer. Davis, on
the other hand, is currently the state's lieutenant-governor, which
is rather like being a neutered version of the vice-president.
</P>
<P>
   All of which ought to be good news for the Republicans, who have
held the governorship for the past 16 years. The economy is as
successful as it has been in a generation, with the state's gross
annual product passing the trillion-dollar mark and its treasury
brimming with a $4 billion surplus.
</P>
<P>
   Serious crime has fallen by a third on Lungren's watch. Add to
this the fact that Lungren was all but unopposed for his party's
nomination, whereas Davis had to slog it out with two free-spending
rivals, and you have a strong case for sticking with Tweedledum
rather than risking Tweedledee.
</P>
<P>
   And yet Lungren is far from being a shoo-in for the
governorship. The Democrats have long had more registered voters
than the Republicans (currently 47 percent of the electorate
compared with 35 percent).
</P>
<P>
   In the past four elections they have squandered this advantage
by choosing candidates who were either too exotic or too
inexperienced to win over the suburbs; but Davis's very
Tweedledeeness could play well there.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans are also much exercised by their poor showing
among Latinos, who now make up 12 percent of the state's voters, up
from 7 percent six years ago. This is indeed dismal: Bob Dole
managed to get a mere 6 percent of the Latino vote, compared with
Ronald Reagan's 45 percent in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   But an even bigger problem for Lungren will be his ability to
sell his hard-edged brand of conservatism to the broad middle
class.
</P>
<P>
   California is a relatively moderate state, free from the
strident moralizing that flourishes in the South. (Bureaucratic
moralizing is another matter: witness the state's absurd ban on
smoking in bars.)
</P>
<P>
   Reagan combined his enthusiasm for the free market with a
laissez-faire attitude to personal morality. Pete Wilson, the
current governor, is one of the Republican Party's leading
advocates of abortion choice.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Riordan, the popular Republican (and Catholic) mayor of
normally Democratic Los Angeles, has preserved an impeccably
liberal stance on what Californians like to call ``lifestyle
issues.''
</P>
<P>
   But Lungren is an altogether more ideological figure, a close
ally of Newt Gingrich, a leading author of the ``Contract with
America,'' a supporter of school vouchers and an outspoken opponent
of abortion.
</P>
<P>
   He spent three years, and much soul-searching, before deciding
to join 37 other states in suing the tobacco companies. He has
repeatedly been accused of blunting the impact of the state's ban
on assault rifles.
</P>
<P>
   Davis thus has plenty of material for portraying his rival as a
Newt Gingrich in Tweedledum's clothing. On the abortion issue in
particular, he will be able both to unite his own fissiparous party
and drive a wedge between fiscal and social conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   Lungren has done much to soften his image in recent months,
particularly among Latinos. He won 17 percent of the Latino vote in
the primary, and has taken to advertising on Spanish-language
television _ a first for Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   He opposed the proposition that killed bilingual education,
joined the Democrat-driven suit against Microsoft and now
emphasizes that, as governor, he will be able to do little about
abortion. He has done as much to distance himself from Wilson as he
can without risking a public rift.
</P>
<P>
   But the chances are still high that the Democrats will be able
to demonize Lungren in the run-up to November, not least because,
in his heart of hearts, he is a conviction politician.
</P>
<P>
   This could well be bad news for California. For all his social
conservatism, Lungren is an advocate of a lot of things _ notably
school vouchers _ that could help to galvanize California's
moribund public sector, whereas Davis is little more than a
cat's-paw of the trade unions.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the presence of a Republican governor has acted as a
valuable check on the ambitions of the Democratic legislature. The
state's Chamber of Commerce calculates that dozens of
``job-destroying'' bills have never got past the mere threat of
Wilson's veto.
</P>
<P>
   Lungren's defeat, should it come to that, will be even more of a
blow to the Republican Party, both locally and nationally. The next
governor will play a leading role in redrawing the boundaries of
California's 50-plus congressional seats, a process that could
decide the balance of power in Washington for a generation.
</P>
<P>
   And Lungren is the most impressive Republican the state has
produced since Reagan: a man with deep roots in the party (his
father was Richard Nixon's campaign physician) but with a nice
populist touch (his performances as the lead singer in his rock
band, Elvis and the Lawmen, are reported to be impressive).
</P>
<P>
   If he cannot sell today's brand of radical Republicanism to the
country's largest state, then nobody can. &QL;

<P>
   SEATTLE _ America's drug problems are not all on its southern
border. In the past two years the amount of marijuana coming into
the United States from Canada, calculated from the amount captured
by customs and drug agents, has more than quadrupled.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994 United States customs agents in Blaine, Wash. _ a
popular smugglers' crossing point _ had ten marijuana-related
cases. In the current year (which for customs agents began in
October), 79 cases have been reported, according to Brian Rockom,
an agent in Blaine.
</P>
<P>
   The reason is simple: British Columbian pot has become the
champagne of cannabis.
</P>
<P>
   The stuff that makes pot appealing is a chemical known as THC _
short for delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol. Most American baby-boomers,
in their misspent youth, smoked pot with a THC content of maybe 2
percent. Later, Hawaiian grass labeled ``Maui Wowie'' offered an
impressive 10 percent or 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Now, British Columbia-based growers, using carefully bred seeds
and sophisticated indoor hydroponic gardens, sometimes produce
marijuana with a mind-blowing THC content of 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Americans are willing to pay hefty amounts for this wonder weed:
as much as $6,000-7,000 a pound ($2,700-3,200 a kilo) by the time
the stuff wends its way down from British Columbia to Los Angeles,
or ten times as much as they will pay for the average pound of
Mexican marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   Why British Columbia? History and politics, says Marc Emery, a
loquacious Vancouver-based hemp entrepreneur who is the publisher
of Cannabis Canada magazine.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1960s, he says, Vancouver's San Francisco-like style
drew droves of Vietnam draft-resisters, many of whom brought with
them packets of marijuana seeds. In time they adapted those seeds
for fast growth in the province's relatively chilly climate, and
for potency.
</P>
<P>
   As word got out about Canadian marijuana, and as the profits
grew, what had been a hobby became an increasingly lucrative
business. It remains an easy business to get into, says Emery.
</P>
<P>
   Pot is easy to grow _ ``all it takes is some seed and cow dung''
_ and it is largely tolerated, if not exactly legal, in the
province.
</P>
<P>
   Emery estimates that 10 percent of British Columbia's 3.5
million residents either smoke or grow the stuff. Big pot-growers,
when caught, often escape prison.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, the growing intolerance of drugs puts pot
in the same league as cocaine and heroin, with 500,000 pot-related
arrests each year. That crackdown has made cannabis riskier to grow
south of the border.
</P>
<P>
   Hence ``BC Bud,'' the brand name for the several hundred
different strains of marijuana that grow in British Columbia and
pack a big punch.
</P>
<P>
   Emery estimates that the crop is now worth $4 billion _ a figure
which, if true, would put it close to tourism and ahead of mining
and farming in the province's economy.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in the United States and Canada put the figure rather
lower, but still at more than $2 billion. More than 3,000
commercial pot-growing operations now cultivate as many as 2,400
plants at a time.
</P>
<P>
   Working hard to nab their output is a force of United States
customs agents stationed in Blaine. But the 158 agents have 50
miles of border to patrol between the coast and the inland
mountains.
</P>
<P>
   The border is unfenced, as befits two friendly countries, and
much of it is conveniently equipped for smugglers with roads on
either side. ``Sometimes,'' says Rockom, ``they just throw the
stuff across.''
</P>
<P>
   The anti-smuggling operation is being expanded, but border
officials say that, at best, they catch only 10 percent of the weed
that is heading south.
</P>
<P>
   There are too many holes in the net to plug them all; and,
despite increasing Canadian efforts, there is still too little
reason not to grow the stuff. Moreover, pretty well anyone can be a
smuggler.
</P>
<P>
   In one famous case, officials arrested a 77-year-old man and a
71-year-old woman. They had 42 pounds of pot in their car. &QL;

   WASHINGTON AND BEIJING _ The American president who once accused
his predecessor of ``kowtowing'' to China himself departed to the
Middle Kingdom on June 24, taking with him five cabinet members,
six congressmen, 200 journalists, 500 staff, ten limousines, the
First Lady and his daughter, Chelsea.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton will be assured of a warm reception from President
Jiang Zemin, who looks back fondly on his own visit to the United
States last autumn. Yet back in Washington, Clinton leaves a storm.
</P>
<P>
   This visit, the first by an American president since the
massacre around Tiananmen Square nine years ago, has attracted
controversy. Opposition comes on one side from a hawkish Republican
right, and on the other from leftish Democrats concerned about
human rights.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition view, Henry Kissinger wrote recently in Newsweek,
``is more compatible with confrontation than with stabilizing, much
less improving, the relationship with the world's most populous
country.''
</P>
<P>
   Opposition makes for good politics back home at the moment. A
small band of right-wingers has long sought to demonize China as a
Stalinist, brutal, internationally destabilizing regime in the
mould of the old Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   They have even found a sympathetic audience among moderate
Republican congressmen. Midterm elections take place in November,
and attacking Clinton over China is a good way for Republicans to
try to keep their shaky hold over the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, Clinton is attacked for allowing waivers for two
American companies, Loral Space &AMP; Communications and Hughes
Electronics, to launch their satellites on China's Long March
rockets _ never mind that similar waivers were issued during George
Bush's presidency.
</P>
<P>
   And, since Pakistan last month conducted nuclear tests in
response to India's, the administration has come in for attack for
not doing enough to stop China from exporting missile and nuclear
technology to Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   Right-wingers find common ground with the left on China's
human-rights record. Babies, Americans have heard, are ripped
callously out of wombs in pursuit of China's one-child policy.
Hollywood's radical chic promote a picture of a Tibet bloodily
suppressed.
</P>
<P>
   Human-rights groups see the recent dispatch of two of China's
best-known dissidents, Wei Jingsheng and Wang Dan, to America on
``medical parole'' as cynical exercises in public relations. The
freedom to worship is restricted.
</P>
<P>
   All these charges are true, up to a point. But they take into
account neither the ways in which China is changing for the better,
albeit rather messily, nor the ways in which America might be able
to nudge such change along.
</P>
<P>
   It is easier, instead, to demonize President Clinton for
agreeing to be welcomed by Jiang in the Great Hall of the People,
next to Tiananmen Square _ that ``infamous killing field,'' as one
congressman puts it.
</P>
<P>
   The criticism has thrown the administration on the defensive.
The release of Wei and Wang, says one of Clinton's officials,
``doesn't check the box and get (China) off the hook on
human-rights issues.'' This is where China remains on ``the wrong
side of history,'' says Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Asia's economic troubles, he argues, might have real
consequences for America's Main Street if China were not open,
stable and secure. And that requires American engagement.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides have common geographical concerns: for instance, the
future of Taiwan, stability in the Korean peninsula and calm
between India and Pakistan, as well as a desire to combat
international crime and tackle China's overwhelming environmental
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Yet American views of Clinton's trip, which includes a visit to
Hong Kong, are likely to change as the notoriously insensate White
House press pack sniffs a new direction _ the warm reception the
president will get from ordinary Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   The pack will learn that few Chinese, not even former Tiananmen
protesters, are dismayed at Clinton's attendance at the square. Nor
will they miss the significance if the president is allowed to
speak live on Chinese television about human rights.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinary Chinese do not need a strong attachment to American
notions of democracy to appreciate that Clinton's visit is, in a
way, a confirmation of what (for at least the fourth time this
century) is called the New China.
</P>
<P>
   It might better be called the ``blue'' China: coastal,
outward-looking, cosmopolitan, tolerant and increasingly
sophisticated.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the old, ``brown'' China still exists, embodied in
much of the Communist Party: inward-looking, suspicious of markets,
authoritarian or corrupt, and generally dirt-poor.
</P>
<P>
   Dispassionate observers must pick among both to get a clear
picture, but there is no doubt that blue China is nowadays in the
ascendancy.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, China's top leaders, for the moment, are blues.
They are committed to binding China by the rules of the
international economy. They have made progress checking the
proliferation of weapons technology, of which China, up until at
least 1992, was a notorious exporter. They have acted with
sophistication and restraint throughout Asia's financial troubles.
</P>
<P>
   Last week Jiang said China would sign the United Nations
covenant on civil and political rights this autumn.
</P>
<P>
   All this serves China's interests well: few nations are better
practiced in realpolitik. Yet China's leaders long for
respectability on the world stage.
</P>
<P>
   The ``constructive strategic partnership'' that both sides tout
may well contain a lot of hot air. Substantive agreements from
Clinton's trip may be few. But to have refused to go to Beijing
would have put President Clinton firmly on the wrong side of
history. &QL;

CLINTON AND AIDES RESPOND SOFTLY TO CHINA'S ARREST OF DISSIDENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ President Clinton responded cautiously Friday to the
Chinese government's ham-handed roundup of prominent dissidents in
the opening days of his historic visit and said the arrests
underlined the importance of his policy of engaging China.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese authorities' detention of at least three political
activists in the city of Xian where Clinton began his nine-day
visit played right into the hands of the president's critics back
home who insist that his policy of ``constructive engagement'' with
China is a one-way street.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton called reports of the arrests ``disturbing'' and added:
``If true, they represent not China at its best and not China
looking forward but looking backward.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials tried to minimize the impact of
the seizures at the outset of 11 hours of U.S.-China summitry
following a controversial welcoming ceremony in Tiananmen Square.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is the first American president to visit China since the
murderous crackdown on pro-democracy activists in and around
Tinanamen Square in 1989. The suppression claimed the lives of up
to 800 unarmed demonstrators and bystanders.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said China's latest detentions merely underscore the
necessity of his mission to persuade Chinese authorities to expand
individuals' political freedoms to match the shift to a burgeoning
free enterprise system.
</P>
<P>
   The arrests make ``it all the more important that we continue to
work with the Chinese and to engage them,'' Clinton said in Xian
before flying to Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has insisted that privately conveying U.S. concerns
about Chinese human rights has paid off with prisoner releases and
expanded U.S.-Chinese trade.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials said there was not a reliable count on the number
of dissidents detained or arrested. One U.S. official, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said White House officials regard the
crackdown merely as an effort by local governments to stem
potential protests by activists who might seek to use Clinton's
visit as protection for their activities.
</P>
<P>
   National Security Adviser Samuel ``Sandy'' Berger also
downplayed Clinton administration concerns, insisting that the
ill-timed detentions were ``not directed at'' Clinton because
``this happens generally in connection with these types of
visits.''
</P>
<P>
   Berger added that the detentions were ``not of the scale that
has happened before.''
</P>
<P>
   Only when pressed by reporters did Berger begin to express
indignation.
</P>
<P>
   The arrests are ``thoroughly unacceptable,'' Berger said. The
Chinese government's explanation in response to inquiries by
Ambassador James Sasser ``so far has not been terribly
satisfactory,'' Berger said, adding: ``They dispute the facts or
otherwise explain these incidents away.''
</P>
<P>
   Berger declared at one point: ``People are not debris to be
swept up for a visitor and we have expressed our concern about this
to the Chinese government.''
</P>
<P>
   Berger, who has visited China twice in recent months to set the
stage for Clinton's visit, said Chinese authorities approached the
visit with a ``combination of excitement, anticipation and fear''
that triggered ``the instinct of some...to let their desire for
order overwhelm their ability to permit expression.''
</P>
<P>
   Aides said Clinton planned to privately press Chinese President
Jiang Zemin to release more than 2,000 imprisoned Chinese citizens
who are either in labor re-education camps or prison, including
about 150 residents of Beijing imprisoned for their roles in the
Tiananmen Square movement.
</P>
<P>
   Berger hinted that Chinese authorities would release additional
dissidents from prison after Clinton's departure, adding: ``I would
not anticipate that we would see the fruits of those discussions
while we're here.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's arrival in the ancient Chinese capital of Xian late
Thursday appeared to trigger the detention of at least three
advocacy of democracy and the forced flight of a fourth activist.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and his advisers have resisted appeals to meet privately
with Chinese dissidents _ claiming that the rendezvous could irk
the Beijing regime and provoke retaliatory arrests after he leaves.

<P>
   Yang Hai, a resident of Xian and one of 70 Chinese who signed an
open letter appealing for Clinton to meet with dissidents during
his visit, was detained Thursday shortly after ABC News'
correspondent Sam Donaldson tried to interview him at an Xian
hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese authorities detained two other Xian-area activists, as
well, according to the Information Center of Human Rights and
Democratic Movement in China, based in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   Yan Jun, a Xian resident who signed the letter, and Li Zhiying,
who lives near Xian, were detained Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese police also picked up Fu Sheng, a resident of Xian who
signed the appeal to Clinton, and sent him by train to Qingdao on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the reasons that I came here was to discuss both
privately and publicly issues of personal freedom,'' Clinton told
reporters on Friday as he prepared to meet with residents of the
village of Xiahe, adjacent to the site of the buried 2,200-year-old
terra cotta warriors outside Xian. ``So I think it's very important
for me to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton says his efforts have won the release of two prominent
Chinese dissidents in the past eight months. Wei Jingsheng was
freed from prison and sent into exile in the United States last
November shortly after Clinton raised his case during the state
visit to the United States by Chinese President Jiang Zemin.
</P>
<P>
   Wang Dan was freed and sent into U.S. exile in April.

 &HT;    CLINTON FLIES TO BEIJING FOR SUMMIT TALKS
 &HT;    EDs: Note that the time for broadcast of the Tiananmen ceremony
is one hour earlier than we originally thought.
 &HT;    By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT and MARCIA KUNSTEL 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ President Bill Clinton flew to smoggy Beijing Friday
in hopes of wrapping up a nuclear weapons ``detargeting'' agreement
by which both sides would pledge not to point their missiles at
each other.
</P>
<P>
   After a low-pressure day in Xi'an of sightseeing and talking
with peasants about their village-level elections, Air Force One
headed here for an intense weekend of negotiations and banquets
with leaders of China's ruling communist party politburo.
</P>
<P>
   The initial glow of Clinton's Day One in China was dimmed Friday
with the news that Chinese security officials had detained three
dissidents in Xi'an, reportedly after they delivered a letter to
the city police bureau protesting the arrest of several other
dissidents.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton called reports of the detentions ``disturbing.'' His
national security adviser Samuel ``Sandy'' Berger added, ``People
are not debris to be swept up for a visitor.''
</P>
<P>
   Official talks with Chinese President Jiang Zemin are set to
begin immediately after the Chinese carry through their 21-gun
welcoming ceremony for the American president on the western edge
of Tiananmen Square. The 20-minute Tiananmen ceremony is expected
to be broadcast live on some American news networks at 9 p.m.
Friday EDT (9 a.m. Saturday Beijing time).
</P>
<P>
   If behind-the-scenes bargaining between U.S. and Chinese
security advisers goes well, a missile detargeting agreement is
likely to be unveiled in a signing ceremony in front of the Great
Hall of the People a few hours after the Tiananmen Square welcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would certainly like such an agreement,'' Berger told a
news briefing in Xi'an. But Berger said he wasn't sure if details
could be worked out.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Clinton's homefront critics have called a
``detargeting'' deal meaningless, arguing that a missile's
targeting coordinates can be secretly updated in less than 20
minutes. Clinton has replied that such an agreement could prevent
an accidental world war.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you detarget, yes, you can always go retarget a missile, we
all know that,'' Clinton said in a Washington interview with Cox
News Service last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it takes some more time, and 20 minutes in a world of
instantaneous communications is an eternity. So the possibility of
avoiding a mistake, or even backing down from a conflict, is
dramatically increased with detargeting.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton reached America's first ``detargeting'' agreement with
Russian President Boris Yeltsin in 1994. Then Russia signed a
similar ``detargeting'' agreement with China in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   But for the last year, China has resisted American entreaties to
join in a mutual ``detargeting'' pact. A Chinese Foreign Ministry
spokesman insisted again this month that the United States must
first sign a ``no first use'' pledge, under which no future
American president could threaten nuclear strikes to deter a
non-nuclear ground or sea attack.
</P>
<P>
   Western intelligence agencies have reported that China has an
aging thermonuclear strike force of 13 to 18 intercontinental
ballistic missiles (ICBM), including perhaps four with sufficient
range to hit New York City and Washington D.C. According to Chinese
sources, each Chinese ICBM is armed with one city-busting hydrogen
bomb warhead of three-to-five megatons.
</P>
<P>
   Before heading to Beijing and the controversial Tiananmen Square
welcome, Clinton spent the day around Xi'an Friday, visiting
villages and touring China's most important archeological dig, the
2nd Century B.C. vault containing than 7,000 ancient terra cotta
warriors, horses and chariots.
</P>
<P>
   In the nearby village of Xiahe, Clinton heard Yang Dongye, 56,
the owner of a soy sauce and vinegar factory, enthuse about how his
life has improved in China since the wave of private-enterprise
reforms initiated by the late communist leader Deng Xiaoping in
1979.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, no matter what your abilities are, you are told
to do what you are supposed to do,'' Yang said. ``But after the
reform, everyone can have the space to show their own talent and to
work very hard.''

MONGANTHAU, AFTER ARREST, SEEKS REPEAL OF STOCK RULE 
</HEADLINE>
  (gm) 
 By JOHN SULLIVAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Announcing arrests in an international stock swindle
Thursday, the Manhattan district attorney, Robert Morgenthau,
called on federal authorities to repeal a regulation that he said
leaves investors vulnerable to fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Morgenthau said the defendants in his recent investigation used
a law that allows companies to avoid many financial reporting
requirements when issuing stock outside the United States. The
section of the federal securities law, called Regulation S, has
been the subject of controversy during the last several years.
</P>
<P>
   Manhattan prosecutors said Thursday that the defendants had
taken advantage of the regulation to fraudulently inflate the stock
value of several small companies. They said that investors in
England and the United States were cheated out of more than $17
million in the last five years as a result of the fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Morgenthau said that the suspects approached small companies in
need of cash and told them they could provide fast money by selling
stock to overseas investors. Because the stock sales fell under
Regulation S, the companies did not have to file financial
information with Federal regulators.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said the defendants set up phony corporations on the
Isle of Jersey, and used the corporations to buy the stock. The
phony companies traded the stocks back and forth, inflating their
value.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the stocks were sold to American and British
investors, who did not know that they were overvalued, prosecutors
said. A critical element of the fraud, Morgenthau said, was the
inability of legitimate investors to get accurate financial
information about the stgck offerings _ because of Regulation S.
</P>
<P>
   One of the men, Salvatore Mazzio, 40, of Long Island, a New York
stock promoter, has already pleaded guilty to attempted enterprise
corruption and faces up to 15 years in state prison, Morgenthau
said. Two other suspects have been arrested by the British police,
but have not yet been charged, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my opinion, Regulation S is a big mistake,'' Morgenthau
said Thursday. ``There really is a single market now. It isn't as
though the markets in Europe, or anywhere else, are all that
different.''
</P>
<P>
   Regulation S has been debated in the financial community in the
last several years, in part because law enforcement officials
believe it was a tool that was increasingly used for fraud. John
Moscow, a prosecutor who has handled a number of complicated
financial cases for Morgenthau's office, said Thursday that
Regulation S ``has been known for years as a scoundrel's delight.''
</P>
<P>
   Duncan King, a spokesman for the Securities and Exchange
Commission, said Thursday that the commission had tightened
Regulation S in the last several months. The commission has
increased the reporting requirements and has lengthened a holding
period during which Regulation S stock cannot be sold in United
States markets.
</P>
<P>
   The original purpose of the Regulation S exemption was to lessen
the expense of raising capital for American corporations by
eliminating the often high costs of reporting and registering
stocks with the SEC.
</P>
<P>
   Among the changes made this spring were stronger financial
record-keeping requirements for companies that do issue Regulation
S stock. Under the new regulations, companies must affix a marker
to the stock indicating it was issued under Regulation S.
</P>
<P>
   The companies also must keep records of who buys the Regulation
S stock, and must notify the buyers that the stock cannot legally
be sold in the United States until a year after its issue date.
Even then, King said, there are restrictions on how much stock can
be sold at one time.
</P>
<P>
   But Morgenthau said that the failure to require full disclosure
in stock issuance was an invitation for fraud, particularly when
overseas investors could hide behind bank secrecy laws that exist
in many foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``The concept is wrong,'' Morgenthau said. ``Whatever they do
overseas affects U.S. investors.''

 &HT;    COLUMN: This concerns a cat and a religious experience
 &HT;    By Gary Borders
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUFKIN, Texas _ We moved across town finally, starting last
weekend and continuing through most of the week. By late Wednesday,
we were out of the old house, in the new one and had unpacked
everything.
</P>
<P>
   Some people greet this news with some disbelief. You moved,
unpacked and even hung the pictures in four days, they say
skeptically. It takes us months to unpack everything.
</P>
<P>
   This is largely a difference in perspective, I suspect. I am a
maniac about unpacking as quickly as possible. I will start early
and stay late. For example, the night that preceded the religious
experience and the cat, I hung pictures until 2:30 a.m. and was
back up at 7 finishing up.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, my running buddy has the same approach to moving. Get
it done, get the stuff put up and get things back to normal as
quickly as possible. Or as normal as they get in a house with a
teen rock musician, a precocious nine-year-old beauty-queen
fanatic, and my two weekend teen-agers. Not to mention the cats.
</P>
<P>
   Being a long_time cat tenant (nobody owns cats; you just rent
them for a while), I have learned to leave the cats in the old home
as long as possible. Cats are Republican in nature. They don't like
change. Dogs are Democrats. They have a lot of fun but make a lot
of messes. So when moving cats, I make it the absolutely last thing
that I do.
</P>
<P>
   Kiki came to the new house first. She's my running buddy's cat,
a pretty Siamese with a brain about the size of an acorn _ and only
about half of that actually works. Luckily she has a winning
personality. It took her about 30 seconds to adapt to the new
house. Her approach was simple: Hide under the bed and sleep during
the day, and get on top of the bed and sleep with us at night. Eat
a lot and meow a lot. Siamese cats have an annoying meow.
</P>
<P>
   Otto is a tougher nut. He was my cat pre-marriage, and he's had
a rough life. He weighs about 15 pounds, a gray tabby who's
probably five years old and though neutered will still fight
anything in sight. Cats, dogs, raccoons _ it doesn't matter.
</P>
<P>
   Otto and I are tight. He showed up at my house during the
bachelor days, and we hit it off well. During those days, he stayed
outside all the time, often disappearing for days at a time but
then showing up bedraggled, often bearing a few fresh scars. It's
rough having to uphold a reputation as a kick-bootie cat. I fed him
faithfully, got his shots, and spent many pleasant hours on the
deck with him lying beside me, his fat head on my lap.
</P>
<P>
   When we got married and moved yet again, Otto mellowed out. My
theory is the female influence of my running buddy. Soon Otto was
staying inside most of the time, sleeping on the couch and
generally turning sorry. He and Kiki made peace after about six
months of brief skirmishes. The turning point was when he and Kiki
were chasing each other around the swimming pool, and Kiki nudged
him on a hairpin curve. Otto went into the pool.
</P>
<P>
   He got right out, shook himself like a dog. It's the first time
I've seen a cat look embarrassed. Imagine the ignominy, a 15-pound
cat knocked into the drink by a five-pound weenie Siamese. After
that, Otto's reputation was shot. He was humbled.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, on Wednesday, I brought Otto out to the new house. He
was not a happy camper. Cats don't like riding the road, especially
locked up in a small cage. I was careful not to let him outside all
day. He eventually settled down and slept on our bed. Everything
seemed fine.
</P>
<P>
   Late that night, while hanging pictures, he wanted outside. Otto
won't use a litter box, which is another reason we're tight. Cats
can be housebroken just like dogs if they've got a lick of sense.
Even Kiki, bless her heart, is housebroken. I hate litter boxes.
</P>
<P>
   So I let him out and waited. He took off like a rocket. I called
him for about 30 minutes. Finally I went to bed.
</P>
<P>
   Next day, no Otto. We searched, asked around. By the next night,
I was convinced he'd hit the road again. After all, that's how I
got him.
</P>
<P>
   I was depressed. I've never been this attached to an animal. So
I sat in the porch swing late Thursday night, occasionally calling
his name.
</P>
<P>
   Then I prayed. It was a brief prayer, just a sentence really.
What I said was, ``Please God, bring Otto back here.''
</P>
<P>
   He showed up not 15 seconds later, meowing loudly. He was worn
out from whupping the competition, came inside, ate loudly and
slept until late the next morning.
</P>
<P>
   The small hairs on the back of my neck stood up when he turned
the corner and walked up just as soon as I finished my prayer.
Maybe it was coincidence, or good luck, or whatever.
</P>
<P>
   But I don't think so.

 &HT;    Don't ask for dolphins at JJ's place
 &HT;    By Cheryl Blackerby
 &HT;    c. 1998 Palm Beach Post/Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI BEACH, Fla. _ Want to watch a game and eat at the same
time?
</P>
<P>
   How about a lot of games?
</P>
<P>
   At Miami Dolphins Coach Jimmy Johnson's restaurant,
coincidentally called Jimmy Johnson's Three Rings Bar and Grill,
you can watch all the sports you want on 35 TVs.
</P>
<P>
   At Jimmy's, don't look for dolphin on the menu (the name has
been changed to mahi-mahi) but you can get the Brent Burger ($7.25)
and the Chad Chicken Sandwich ($8.25), named after Johnson's sons,
and the Rhonda Pasta Primavera ($10.50), inspired by Johnson's
girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy chose the nachos as his namesake - Jimmy's Super Nachos
($8.25).
</P>
<P>
   Pictures of Jimmy are all over the place, and if you get tired
of looking at him you can always check out the ocean - the
restaurant is next to the beach - or watch people jumping into a
pool, unaware that there is see-through glass between the pool and
restaurant. (Make sure you don't lose your swimsuit in this pool.)
</P>
<P>
   JJ's is behind the Eden Roc Hotel. It's open from 11:30 a.m. to
2 a.m. and until 4 a.m. Friday and Saturday nights. Call
305-672-6224.
</P>
<P>
   Get there early for a seat to watch a big game, especially a
Dolphins game.

 &HT;    The idea of being in charge isn't all it's cracked up to be
 &HT;    By Jim Minter
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   We were enjoying a normal breakfast when my wife shattered the
morning calm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we ought to consider joining the Baptists,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   I was stunned. ``What do you mean?'' I asked. ``We're lifelong
Methodists, and you know how I hate getting water in my ears.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We might have a better marriage under the Southern Baptist
plan,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you mean the deal about wives being graciously submissive
to their husbands, I agree,'' I said. ``A lot of the problems we
have in this country are caused by wives who want to wear the
breeches.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm willing to give it a try,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You certainly should,'' I agreed. ``It says in the Bible
you're supposed to love, honor and obey your husband.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I can make up for all those years I've infringed on your
rightful role as head of the household,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you sure you don't have anything in your coffee other than
cream and sugar?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking about the first year we were married and you
went on an out-of-town trip,'' she answered. ``You forgot to pay
the bills and they almost yanked out the telephone and shut off the
electricity in our apartment. After that I took over paying the
bills.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, but I had more important things to do.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I know,'' she said. ``But now that you have more time I'd like
to submit our bill-paying responsibilities where they rightfully
belong.''
</P>
<P>
   I told her that while I appreciated the thought, it would be
perfectly fine with me for her to keep on paying the bills and
balancing the monthly bank statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' she said. ``If I control the money I won't be a
graciously submissive wife. I'll still be in charge.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I really should start back paying the bills,'' I
agreed. ``You do spend a lot of your time on medical claims now
that they have to be filed five or six times in several different
places before anyone will agree to paying anything.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You can do the medical claims, too,'' she said. ``I don't want
to infringe on important things like that.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea of being in charge of all our money had a certain
appeal. ``I'm glad you've adopted the Baptist plan,'' I said. ``You
mean I can write checks for whatever I want?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Just so you have enough left over to pay for the groceries,''
she cautioned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course,'' I agreed. ``When you go to the grocery store,
just make out a list and figure approximately what everything will
cost. I'll give you a check, and if you have anything left over you
can go by the yogurt shop and have a treat.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But I won't be doing the grocery shopping,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then who will?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``You will,'' she answered. ``Don't you remember telling about
how your daddy did all the grocery shopping at John M. Jackson's
store in Fayetteville? Now that I've decided to be a graciously
submissive wife, we're going to do things the old way.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You mean I can smoke cigars in the house?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll have to look that up in Paul's letter to the Ephesians,''
she replied. ``I don't remember what he said about cigars.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Did Paul say anything about wives picking up wet towels and
dirty underwear, and not fussing when the man of the house forgets
to take off his sweaty clothes before sitting on the sofa?'' I
inquired.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're being sacrilegious,'' she snapped.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do feel bad about the way I've taken over some of the things
that gave you a macho feeling,'' she continued.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like what?''
</P>
<P>
   ``You've always bragged about how good you could make up a bed
when you were in the Army.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You bet,'' I said. ``When I dropped a quarter on the top
blanket, it bounced 6 inches into the air.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I know,'' she said. ``And I've horned in and deprived you of
that pleasure. From now on, I'm going to let you make the bed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' I said. ``At the rate you're going I guess you'll
graciously submit the ironing, the vacuuming, window-washing and
cooking Sunday dinner when the children come.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Exactly,'' she replied. ``I'm turning over a new leaf and
letting you be in charge of everything.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we should keep on being Methodists and not risk getting
water in our ears,'' I suggested.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Methodists have their own problems,'' she pointed out.
``They're trying to decide what to do about same-sex marriages.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a tricky one,'' I agreed. ``How will they figure out
which one is supposed to graciously submit?'' Religion is getting
to be a hazardous undertaking.

 &HT;    Glamor and glitter: Desi and Lucy stayed here
 &HT;    By Cheryl Blackerby
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI BEACH, Fla. _ Things happen at the Eden Roc Resort.
</P>
<P>
   Like the time recently when Bobby Brown arrived with his wife,
Whitney Houston, and caused a scene in the lobby, berating bellmen
and any service people within shouting distance.
</P>
<P>
   Or the time George Clooney was kicked off the hotel's basketball
court because he had sneaked in without paying the $35 fee for
nonguests. And it wasn't the first time, according to a hotel
spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   The Eden Roc is never dull, and it has been that kind of place
since the doors opened in 1956, and Harry Belafonte, Milton Berle
and Nat King Cole played the resort's elegant Cafe Pompeii.
</P>
<P>
   Desi and Lucy were frequent guests, and the hotel's intimate
Mona Lisa Room was the setting for private parties including one
for Elizabeth Taylor and Mike Todd for the premiere of the film
Around the World in 80 Days.
</P>
<P>
   Just off the pool deck was Harry's American Bar, the hottest
nightclub in town, where celebrities could mingle with other
celebrities including Katharine Hepburn, Groucho Marx, Jackie
Gleason, Esther Williams, Bogie and Bacall, and Ernest Hemingway.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most glamorous hotels in glamorous Miami Beach, the
Eden Roc was designed by Morris Lapidus, who also created the
Fontainebleau Hotel next door.
</P>
<P>
   The fantastic decor was beyond description - not Art Deco, not
French and not Baroque, Lapidus claimed. It was just grand - an MGM
set with gleaming terrazzo and marble floors and an enormous
columned lobby.
</P>
<P>
   The hotel has undergone a $28 million restoration, and with the
help of the 96-year-old Lapidus, looks much the same as it did in
its heyday, with mint green Alice-in-Wonderland furniture in the
lobby, and purple and green Baroqueish furniture in the guest
rooms.
</P>
<P>
   And while Ocean Drive's boutique hotels attract their share of
publicity, the 14-story Eden Roc, named after a resort in France,
still is one of the hottest addresses in town. From Boyz to Men to
Sean Connery, Shaquille O'Neal, Steven Spielberg and Debbie
Reynolds, the celebrities still stay at the Roc.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Fontainebleau Hilton Hotel, built in 1954, is
about to undergo a $100 million renovation that will include a
41-story tower. The new building will require the bulldozing of the
100-foot-high trompe l'oeil mural, painted in 1985 by Richard Haas,
on the southern wall of the hotel at a bend in Collins Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   The mural, which gives the illusion of driving between two grand
arches into the resort, is beloved in South Beach and the prospect
of it being torn down has caused an outcry.
</P>
<P>
   Fontainebleau spokesmen won't discuss renovation projects. But
Randall Robinson of the Miami Beach Community Development
Corporation, says the hotel's plans have been approved and the
mural will soon be history.
</P>
<P>
   Take pictures of it now.
</P>
<P>
   BE COOL AT THE POOL
</P>
<P>
   Sweat index: You're not allowed to sweat here - just to exude
glamour. Bring your 4-inch heels and your designer Lycra. Men can
wear anything from Milan.
</P>
<P>
   How much? At the Eden Roc, summer rates range from $145 to $245.
Call (800) 327-8337. At the Fontainebleau, rates range from $169 to
$225. Call (800) 445-8667.
</P>
<P>
   What to do? Both hotels have spas. The Fontainebleau has a great
swimming pool with a waterfall. Kids love it.
</P>

<P>
   The Fontainebleau Hilton's famous 100-foot-high trompe l'oeil
mural,
</P>
<P>
   on Collins Avenue, will be history when a $100-million
renovation,
</P>
<P>
   including a 41-story tower, gets under way.

 &HT;    Travelling Cape Canaveral's wild neighbors best done from car
 &HT;    By John Lopinot
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MERRITT ISLAND, Fla. _ A space center and a scenic refuge live
next door here, co-existing as friendly neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Merritt Island National Wildlife Refuge began as a
buffer zone for Cape Canaveral, when the National Aeronautical and
Space Administration bought 88,000 acres of Merritt Island in 1963.
</P>
<P>
   Now, people come here to see the birds, manatees, bobcats and
raccoons.
</P>
<P>
   The refuge is one of the nation's most unusual natural areas.
With a subtropical climate, the 140,000-acre refuge has been shaped
by millions of years of wind and waves. Its barrier island has
ridges, swales and marshes that support 18 endangered or threatened
wildlife species, more than any other wildlife refuge in the
nation.
</P>
<P>
   Natural salt marshes like this have all but disappeared from
Florida's east coast because of development. Artifacts found at
mounds and shell middens indicate Indians may have lived on the
island as early as 7000 B.C.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1950s NASA began operations at Cape Canaveral. They
expanded significantly in 1961 when President Kennedy expanded
NASA's space exploration. You can see the launch towers for the
space shuttle from some roads in the refuge.
</P>
<P>
   A prime area to view birds is along the 6-mile long Black Point
Wildlife Drive, considered one of the premier birding areas in
Florida. Watching animals and birds in their natural habitat is
exciting, but it takes patience - wildlife often blends in with the
surroundings. Here are some tips to make your trip more successful:
</P>
<P>
   Drive slowly (20 mph or less). Stop frequently and quietly look
and listen.
</P>
<P>
   Take binoculars, wildlife identification guides, cameras, film
and telephoto lenses.
</P>
<P>
   Visit in the early morning or late afternoon when wildlife is
most active. The best months are October through March, during the
seasons when birds migrate. But birds can be found on the refuge
year-round.
</P>
<P>
   Don't look for wildlife just in the open water areas. Search the
mud flats, the edge of dikes, the trees and grass, which provide
cover. Also look for raptors soaring overhead.
</P>
<P>
   Wildlife is accustomed to cars on the wildlife drive. Getting
out of your car to get a closer view or take a picture will
probably scare away your subject. You are encouraged to stop, but
pull over to the side of the road so others can pass.
</P>
<P>
   STOP, LOOK AND LISTEN
</P>
<P>
   Sweat index: Easy going here. Enjoy the wildlife drive from the
air-conditioned comfort from your car. Three short trails will make
you break a sweat this time of year.
</P>
<P>
   How to get there: Take I-95 north to Titusville. Then take SR
406 east to the refuge.
</P>
<P>
   Address: Merritt Island National Wildlife Refuge, P.O. Box 6504,
Titusville, FL 32782. Call (407) 861-0667.
</P>
<P>
   Hours: Sunrise to sunset. The refuge is occasionally closed
during space shuttle launches; call before you go to see if it will
be open.
</P>
<P>
   Admission: Free; but donations are accepted.

 &HT;    The quick tour: 6 beauties on the beach
 &HT;    By Cheryl Blackerby
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI BEACH, Fla. _ While you're eating roast pork at Gloria
Estefan's restaurant, Larios, on Ocean Drive, you can impress your
friends with your knowledge of Art Deco.
</P>
<P>
   All you really need to know is this: The Art Deco buildings in
Miami Beach had three influences - cruise ships, the French world
exposition in 1926 and the turn-of-the-century German philosophy of
no frills architecture.
</P>
<P>
   First, the maritime inspiration. The porthole windows, curved
metal rails, flags and smokestacks on buildings came from the big
ocean liners that docked here. One of the best examples is the
Welcome Center building on Ocean Drive at 10th Street. The back of
the building looks like the bow of a ship moving out to sea.
</P>
<P>
   The second influence was the ornate decorations from the French
Exposition of Modern Industrial and Decorative Arts in 1926. An
example is the ``frozen fountain'' low relief on many buildings.
</P>
<P>
   The German influence was the straight, severe lines of the
``machine age.'' .
</P>
<P>
   You could spend a week inspecting all the buildings in the
district. Or 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a quick tour - all the buildings are on Ocean Drive near
the Welcome Center.
</P>
<P>
   The Park Central Hotel (between Sixth and Seventh streets),
fabulously renovated in 1985, was the first hotel to be returned to
its original splendor. (Miami Beach was decaying in the '60s and
'70s.) Built in 1937, it was the hangout for such Hollywood stars
as Clark Gable and Rita Hayworth. Giorgio Armani stays here. So
does author Anne Rice (along with her fictional French vampire
Lestat).
</P>
<P>
   The Avalon Hotel, on the northwest corner of Seventh Street and
Ocean Drive, has its share of celebs - one of the Spice Girls
checked in two weeks ago. This streamlined Deco building has stark
square columns. The 1955 Olds 88 convertible out front has been the
hotel's mascot for nine years. (It still runs.)
</P>
<P>
   The Waldorf Towers, 860 Ocean Drive. Check out the round glass
tower that looks like a lighthouse or a bridge on a ship.
</P>
<P>
   Versace Villa, corner of Ocean Drive and 11th Street. A
Mediterranean Revival extravaganza in the center of the Deco
district. The owner, Gianni Versace, was gunned down last year in
front of the black gates. This is where the tour buses stop and
block traffic.
</P>
<P>
   The Tides hotel, between 12th and 13th streets. This was the
last big Ocean Drive hotel to be renovated. It opened May last
year, and is the hippest place to stay. It's a severe Art Deco
monolith. Notice the porthole windows.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardozo Hotel. Don't miss the coral balusters and terrazzo
floors. And look out for the Estefans, who eat at the restaurant
occasionally.
</P>
<P>
   ALL DECO-ED OUT AND READY TO STROLL
</P>
<P>
   Sweat index: Saturday morning at 10:30? You're going to sweat,
but not from walking the dozen short blocks on the tour. Most of
the time, you're standing in front of buildings listening to the
guide. Bring a hat and sunscreen. Better yet, go in January.
</P>
<P>
   Tours: Art Deco Walking Tours leave the Art Deco Welcome Center,
on Ocean Drive at 10th Street, every Thursday evening at 6:30 p.m.
and Saturday at 10:30 a.m. Buy tickets, which are $10, at the
Welcome Center. Tours are 90 minutes. Call (305) 672-2014.

 &HT;    Rheumatoid arthritis drug working wonders
 &HT;    By Carolyn Susman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH _ Rheumatoid arthritis began crippling Peter
Looram when he was 41. Slowly, insidiously, the disease _ which
causes the body's immune cells to attack the joints _ sapped his
strength and diminished his ability to use his hands.
</P>
<P>
   By 49, he was taking a regimen of potent drugs that seemed
ineffectual. He spent a lot of time just sitting or lying down _ a
far cry from the outdoor athlete he had been in his adopted home of
Aspen, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't mountain bike or ski. I couldn't do eight hours a
day of work,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Because the drugs he was taking weren't working, Looram's doctor
recommended an experimental drug being tested in his area.
</P>
<P>
   He enrolled last year in one of several national trials for
Enbrel, a drug developed by the Immunex Corp., which offers a new
approach to fighting the pain and inflammation of rheumatoid
arthritis.
</P>
<P>
   This drug targets specific proteins that cause inflammation.
Low-dose chemotherapy drugs, such as the methotrexate Looram was
taking, attempt to depress immune cells in a shotgun manner to
suppress the disease.
</P>
<P>
   The shotgun approach can result in side effects, including liver
and lung problems.
</P>
<P>
   In a remarkably short time after he started Enbrel _ three weeks
_ he was feeling improvement. Pain decreased, and the ability to
move his joints increased.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was tickled,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He found he could do more walking and hiking.
</P>
<P>
   This amazing turnaround doesn't surprise Dr. Yvonne Sherrer, a
Pompano Beach, Fla., rheumatologist who is also conducting
experimental trials with Enbrel.
</P>
<P>
   Even though her study is ``double-blind,'' meaning neither
doctor nor patient knows whether the drug or a placebo is being
administered, Sherrer has seen incredible improvement.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't absolutely know who's getting what until after the
`blind' is taken off, but . . . we've had people go into very quick
and complete remissions,'' she said. ``This is really exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   Sherrer, who has studied the disease for 17 years, said the
improvement was much quicker than with conventional drug
treatments.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw effects within a few weeks. With methotrexate, you
usually don't begin to see (improvement) for six weeks. And it
really doesn't show a significant difference for about three
months.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of these people (in the clinical trials) were
dramatically improved by four to six weeks with fewer side
effects.''
</P>
<P>
   The only negative, she said, is that the drug is injected, much
the same way a diabetic uses insulin. Patients inject once or twice
a week. Occasionally, patients develop a rash at the injection
site, but that seems to be the most serious side effect noted in
studies. Minor colds were also reported.
</P>
<P>
   The improvement was so dramatic for one of Sherrer's patients
that the woman begged to be kept in the trial, even when she
developed high blood pressure unrelated to the drug.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to take her off it, but she begged me to let her stay
on _ that was how much a difference it made in her quality of
life,'' Sherrer said.
</P>
<P>
   Another patient, a forest ranger, was at the point where she was
sure she would be fired or have to quit because of the disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your hands get swollen, stiff, you're in pain, you lose grip
strength. A typical pattern is that it affects the small joints of
the hands and feet, but it can affect really any joint, and if you
can't grip, or hold a pistol . . . well, she's gone from the point
when they were probably going to fire her to doing great.''

 &HT;    Eden Roc caters to the rich, famous
 &HT;    By Cheryl Blackerby
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI BEACH, Fla. Women aren't shy in the locker room of the
Eden Roc Spa.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone is walking around naked, their toned and pumped bodies
dripping with sweat. They all look like Linda Hamilton in the movie
Terminator 2: Judgment Day - bulging forearms, ropy thighs and
washboard stomachs.
</P>
<P>
   People get massages here after they've climbed the rock wall
(ropes are attached to your waist in case you fall), and after
they've worked out on the weight machines, and after a ``spinning
class,'' where you ride a bike as if you're doing the last
kilometer in the Tour de France.
</P>
<P>
   You go to this spa if you're feeling strong.
</P>
<P>
   You train like Evander Holyfield in ``box aerobics.'' Then
there's ``power flex,'' an intense 90-minute cardio and strength
training workout designed to keep your heart rate in ``The Zone'';
``step plus,'' a cardio workout that includes step choreography and
abdominal training; and ``aqua challenge,'' water exercises that
would challenge a porpoise.
</P>
<P>
   At this spa, yoga becomes ``power yoga.''
</P>
<P>
   Are you tired just reading this?
</P>
<P>
   Well, you can go to the spa and do none of the above. I went for
a ``deep tissue'' massage, and it was the most relaxing experience
I've had at a resort spa, and I've been to quite a few.
</P>
<P>
   Candlelight, soft music with the sound of a waterfall and birds,
and a massage therapist named Lisa who took an intense massage to
the edge of pain. It felt great, and the manipulation of muscles
and bones left my shoulders and neck feeling mobile and relaxed. I
could turn my head much easier - I hadn't noticed how stiff my neck
was - which made it easier to look for celebs.
</P>
<P>
   I had just missed Neve Campbell and David Lee Roth climbing the
rock wall. Vanessa Williams and Whitney Houston recently got
massages and facials.
</P>
<P>
   I'll come here again. But I'll probably skip the ``step
challenge'' class and go right to the massage rooms.

 &HT;    Artist's descendants seek original ``GWTW'' works
 &HT;    By Gary Schwan
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The paintings are gone with the wind, too.
</P>
<P>
   For years, artist Armand Seguso's descendants have been looking
for his art, which was used in the original poster and programs for
the movie ``Gone With the Wind.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody in the family has been able to locate any of the
original work for the movie, or the original posters, for that
matter,'' said Armand's grandson Rick Seguso, a West Palm Beach
artist and actor.
</P>
<P>
   Seguso thinks MGM's art department may have simply discarded or
misplaced the oils. But Armand Seguso owned the rights to the
original works, his grandson said. It's possible he might have
painted over the canvases, or thrown them out himself.
</P>
<P>
   For Armand Seguso, ``Gone With the Wind'' was another commission
among many, and he had a reputation as one of the country's fastest
movie illustrators. And one of the best.
</P>
<P>
   ``An old advertising device has attained the stature of a new
art form on the American scene,'' wrote an MGM publication in the
'40s, bragging about Seguso's Old Masterly skill. ``The old
ballyhoo circus poster of the past has been superseded by the
finely executed, super-powered appeal of the modern motion picture
poster.''
</P>
<P>
   Seguso may have worked for Selznick, but his inspiration was
Titian.
</P>
<P>
   Seguso (1897-1984) was born in Italy. He arrived in Wilkes
Barre, Pa., with his family when he was 4 years old. A violinist,
he began a music career at 17 with his waltz composition, ``Dream
of Mother.'' He studied art at the noted National Academy of Design
in New York, paying his way by playing theaters and cabarets.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me of one instance when a fight broke out at a cabaret
he was working,'' Rick Seguso recalled. ``His half-brother pulled
him off a piano bench, where he was playing the violin. Seconds
later, there was a gunshot, and a bullet hit right where he'd been
sitting.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1928, Armand Seguso was commissioned to create advertisements
for Buster Keaton's ``Steamboat Bill, Jr.'' His best work was with
MGM, however. Besides ``Gone With the Wind,'' he created art for
dozens of films, including ``Mrs. Miniver,'' ``For Whom The Bell
Tolls,'' ``Kismet'' and ``Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo.''
</P>
<P>
   Seguso spent most of his career in New York, where he created
oil paintings based on detailed instructions sent to him from
Hollywood. ``He worked mostly from publicity stills and
occasionally live models,'' said Rick Seguso. ``The studio's art
department was very specific about what it wanted, and he was in
demand because he could give it to them quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides creating the posters, Armand Seguso painted portraits of
the lead actors in ``Gone With the Wind,'' which appeared in a
program sold at theaters around the country. Price: 25 cents. Price
today: a lot higher.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Seguso doesn't recall hearing many anecdotes about the film
industry or ``Gone With the Wind.'' He simply remembers his
grandfather as a lively jokester, a ``wonderful ham'' who liked to
play the guitar and violin at home.
</P>
<P>
   He also inspired his grandson, who is a painter, musician and
actor. Rick Seguso, 49, once worked as road manager for Bruce
Springsteen, sharing a house with the rock star in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   His paintings of imaginary landscapes and moody musicians have
won awards. He began exhibiting his work in the '70s, and now shows
at West End Fine Art in West Palm Beach and the International Art
Center in Palm Beach Gardens, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   He's appeared in movies shot in South Florida, such as ``Hostile
Takeover,'' and is currently appearing on stage in the Hollywood
Boulevard Theater production of ``Jenny's Story.''
</P>
<P>
   Has he ever thought of creating posters for his plays? ``No, but
thanks for the idea.''

 &HT;    Can a guy who loves motorcycles teach you about God? He says he
can
 &HT;    By Steve Gushee
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH GARDENS, Fla. _ The Rev. Ray Underwood insists he was
not kicked out of King's Academy in the 11th grade.
</P>
<P>
   He was simply practicing his Kung Fu for Christ routine when his
foot went through the girl's bathroom wall.
</P>
<P>
   Underwood, who was in a Kung Fu for Christ group at a local
church, was suspended for three days and chose to leave the popular
West Palm Beach Christian school in 1975. He graduated from Palm
Beach Gardens High School a year later.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was truly an accident,'' Underwood said. ``But I was a
terror as a kid. People would never have thought I would go into
the ministry.''
</P>
<P>
   He became a minister _ but not much changed.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Underwood is a 6-foot-5, 200-pound, 39-year-old pastor
with a high energy style who rides a ``hog,'' a Harley-Davidson
motorcycle, to services at the church he founded 13 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like speed,'' he said. ``I like going fast. When it comes to
speed, I like being on the edge.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, this wired pastor pours his daring and enthusiasm into his
work. The Palm Beach Community Church in Palm Beach Gardens that
frequently draws as many as 1,000 people on a Sunday is, not
surprisingly, a different kind of place.
</P>
<P>
   The church follows a ``seeker sensitive'' nondenominational
model pioneered by the Willow Creek Community Church in South
Barrington, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to reach Baby Boomers _ and their children _ who are
either spiritually illiterate or have been put off by the
institutional church.
</P>
<P>
   There are no religious symbols to be seen and precious little
religious language to be heard in the Eissey campus theater where
the church meets on the grounds of Palm Beach Community College.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday morning worship is a wondrous mix of music, drama and
nonthreatening Christian teaching in a relaxed atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   A music and drama team of 80 people spend as many as eight weeks
planning each Sunday experience.
</P>
<P>
   Stand-up vocalists belt out Christian music with a heavy beat
accompanied by electric guitars and drums. The audience _ or
congregation _ watches a dramatic presentation about the theme of
the day or sees a video on a huge screen that hangs above the
stage.
</P>
<P>
   And then Underwood or a colleague preaches for 30 minutes or
more using cultural catchwords to communicate religious ideas.
</P>
<P>
   A recent sermon titled ``What Would Jesus say to Bill Gates''
concluded that, in their spiritual life, Gates and everyone else
was running the wrong software, needed to upgrade to God's
operating system and run compatible programs.
</P>
<P>
   The ``seeker'' concept plays down traditional church trappings
and tries to make the ancient Gospel relevant to a high-tech,
fast-track, educated, skeptical population.
</P>
<P>
   ``My favorite word is contextualization,'' Underwood said. ``It
simply means to take the Christian message and make it meaningful
to the cultural context in which you find yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   It seems to work. Kristina Vera got a direct mail promotion from
the church at her home in Palm Beach Gardens earlier this year. The
flier was about dating and relationships; it pictured Underwood on
his ``hog'' and invited her to a Sunday service at the church.
</P>
<P>
   Vera, 38, never went to church as a child, she said, and didn't
know where to start when she felt the need as an adult. The mailing
was intriguing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, `Wow, a reverend with a Harley,' '' Vera said. ``I
can relate to that.''
</P>
<P>
   She found a caring community that welcomed her as a single
woman, addressed issues important in her life and helped her better
understand herself and her world, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have such a false, bad image of the church,'' Underwood
said. ``They look at it as an institution that judges people rather
than one that loves and accepts people.''
</P>
<P>
   His commitment to build a church for the unchurched _ those who
know essentially nothing about religion _ came late in his faith
journey.
</P>
<P>
   Underwood was raised as a Southern Baptist in the First Baptist
Church of Lake Park. His family moved to North Palm Beach from
Miami when he was 3.
</P>
<P>
   He was always rushing as a kid. He thinks he was hyperactive and
knows he was always in trouble, he said.
</P>
<P>
   As a teenager, he raced anything that would move _ hot rods,
dragsters and bikes. He loved risking his life racing his father's
boat.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was such a rush for me because you keep pushing to go
faster and faster. If you go too far, you kill yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time he went to King's Academy in the ninth grade, he
knew he wanted to be a clergyman. That conviction was grounded in
his experiences in a happy home, at church, at church camp, in
prayer and wrestling with God about his future. But, for a
teenager, there were other good reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``The girls at Kings,'' he said. ``You told them (about being a
minister), they'd hug me and kiss me. I'd say, `Oh, this is pretty
good.' ''
</P>
<P>
   He left Kings after the Kung Fu for Christ incident, but not
before meeting Janet Cooley, the young woman who would become his
wife. Their three children, Raymond, 15, Janell, 14, and Phillip,
12, attend Kings now.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was pretty active,'' said Paul Tatham, dean of admissions
at Kings Academy who remembers teaching Underwood's wife. ``He
married a good girl and has great kids. But he was kind of wired in
high school. They often turn out to be your best youth pastor
types. They know all the tricks of the trade.''
</P>
<P>
   Underwood graduated in 1979 after three years at Crichton
College, a nondenominational Bible college in Memphis, married
Janet and entered the Mid American Baptist Seminary in Memphis.
</P>
<P>
   He was hungry for knowledge and eager to start a church. He took
some courses at Fuller Seminary in California and enrolled in the
Trinity Evangelical Divinity School near Chicago to study for a
doctorate in missions.
</P>
<P>
   There, he was introduced to the Willow Creek model of evangelism
and decided to start a church in a high-growth area filled with
unchurched people. Florida was one possibility. A trip to the Holy
Land sealed that decision, he said.
</P>
<P>
   On a bus approaching Tel Aviv in 1983, Underwood was deep in
thought about starting a church in Florida but feared that a local
boy would not be respected as a minister.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked up and there it was in front of me,'' Underwood said.
``A huge sign said Palm Beach. We were staying at the Palm Beach
Hotel in Tel Aviv.''
</P>
<P>
   A dozen people met to start the church in 1985. A lifelong
friend and seminary classmate, Tom Kiedis, offered his mother's
home in Palm Beach Gardens as a meeting place. Kiedis is now the
teaching pastor of the church.
</P>
<P>
   The first public service in October drew more than 200 people to
a movie theater in Loehmann's Plaza in Palm Beach Gardens. They
quickly outgrew one theater and moved into another in the complex.
</P>
<P>
   The church moved to Dwyer High School in Palm Beach Gardens for
two years and then, four years ago, to Eissey Campus theater.
</P>
<P>
   Today, there is a staff of nine and a budget of more than
$800,000. The church leases more than 9,000 square feet of space at
the NorthCorp Center in Palm Beach Gardens for offices and meeting
space to use through the week. A counseling center employs licensed
therapists who offer marital, family and group counseling.
</P>
<P>
   More than 400 people meet regularly in small groups that target
men, women, singles, married couples and deal with relationships or
spiritual issues, Kiedis said.
</P>
<P>
   The church has had a role in starting six clones of itself from
Naples to Orlando, including the Treasure Coast Community Church in
Jensen Beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vision carrier in all this is Ray,'' said Mike Kelly, an
original church member from Palm Beach Gardens. ``I believe God and
Ray are in the same place in terms of trying to serve.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics complain that churches of this kind belittle the Gospel
and water down the power of faith in order to be relevant.
Supporters insist that's not true, and scholars grudgingly agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``As time goes on, I become more and more respectful of these
movements. The places are flooded with people,'' said the Rev.
Lesley Northrup, assistant professor of religion and culture at
Florida International University in Miami. ``At least, you've got
folks who are responding to people who are _ as we used to say in
the '60s _ where they're at.''
</P>
<P>
   Underwood's newest vision is to build a home for the church in a
community church/auditorium in the Abacoa development in Palm Beach
Gardens. Negotiations are under way, Underwood said. The building
would be available for all community groups to use.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think community gathering places play a vital role in
society,'' he said. ``The church used to be that place. It was a
focal point.''
</P>
<P>
   The Southern Baptist youngster who became a motorcycle-riding
pastor wants the church to be a focal point for a new generation of
faith seekers. He offers advice he has followed himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't see church the way you always see church,'' Underwood
said. ``Be willing to get out of the box. Do things in a new way.''
</P>
<P>

Church:

 &HT;    Pampering is the point at Ponte Vedra
 &HT;    By Cheryl Blackerby
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PONTE VEDRA, Fla. _ I arrived early at the Ponte Vedra Inn and
Club Spa for my 8 a.m. appointment. That was the only time slot
available. This spa is a very busy place.
</P>
<P>
   I wore flip-flops, shorts, a T-shirt and no makeup for my
facial, which seemed appropriate to me on this stormy Thursday
morning. But women ranging in age from 30 to 70 turned up for their
appointments in dresses and high-heels.
</P>
<P>
   These ladies took this spa business very seriously.
</P>
<P>
   But we soon were all dressed the same - naked under our
terry-cloth spa-issue robes.
</P>
<P>
   I had signed up for a Swedish massage, which is gentle and
relaxing, and a glycolic facial. They put glycolic acid on your
face to help erase all those little wrinkles.
</P>
<P>
   I was a little worried about that second part. Having acid
thrown on your face sounded painful, and those wrinkles really
weren't that bad ...
</P>
<P>
   But I forgot about that while Billie, the massage therapist,
literally rubbed my worries away. While she firmly stroked my
muscles, she told me about working in a spa on the Norway cruise
ship. When my 50 minutes were up, I was so relaxed I felt like I
had been on a ship for a week. Why pay $1,500 for a cruise when you
could just get Billie to massage you for $60?
</P>
<P>
   I was led to a waiting room in the spa - as modern and clinical
as a hospital - where I was soon summoned for my facial, which at
$80 should make me look like Heather Locklear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will it hurt? My face isn't going to turn really red is it?
Will I be able to go to work tomorrow?'' I was panicking.
</P>
<P>
   But Susan was soothing as she put on so many masks I lost track
- the cleansing mask, the hydrating mask, the pineapple-papaya
mask. She massaged my neck, arms and feet, and by the time I got
the glycolic mask I didn't know what hit me.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it only stung a tiny bit. My face didn't turn red. My
wrinkles were still there, but my skin looked darn good.
</P>
<P>
   That's the main point at this spa. Clients want to look good.
The fitness center with all those machines is across the street,
but in this building, it's beauty that counts.
</P>
<P>
   You can get your hair colored, your nails done, and your body
waxed - lips, brows, chin, half leg, full leg, half arm, full arm,
underarm, you name it.
</P>
<P>
   And 10 minutes away, at the Mayo Clinic, the sky's the limit.
Dr. John Harris, the hospital's head of plastic surgery, often does
seminars at the club.
</P>
<P>
   You can have cosmetic surgery at the clinic and recuperate at
the Ponte Vedra Inn and Club. A lot of women, and men, do.
</P>
<P>
   The club has a health package called the Mayo Ponte Vedra
Seaside Program, where a guest can check into the club hotel, get
an in-depth checkup at the Mayo Clinic on Day 1, and an analysis
and recommendations on lifestyle changes on Day 2.
</P>
<P>
   Through the remainder of the visit, guests follow the doctor's
guidelines at the fitness center and spa, and they take home an
exercise and nutrition program.

 &HT;    Walk this way to a place with plenty of cache
 &HT;    By Cheryl Blackerby
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PONTE VEDRA, Fla. _ There wasn't exactly gold in them thar
hills. In fact, there weren't even any hills. Just a lot of sand
next to the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   But there were rich veins of rutile, ilmenite and zirconium,
used in steel processing, and before you could say ``zirconium
rush'' a bustling settlement known as Mineral City sprang up in the
late 1800s in the northeast corner of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   But by 1928, the bottom had fallen out of the mining market, and
the land's owner, National Lead Co., noticed all the rich
industrialists heading to Henry Flagler's hotels in St. Augustine
and Palm Beach. The company decided to build its own resort.
</P>
<P>
   In 1928, Mineral City became the more sophisticated-sounding
Ponte Vedra, named after a town in Spain. That same year, British
golf-course architect Herbert Strong was hired to design a links
course along the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   A two-story log cabin and ocean-front cottages were built to
accommodate executives, clients and some of those Northeastern oil
tycoons. A private club opened in 1938, and an elite enclave was
born.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the Ponte Vedra Inn and Club is still exclusive, though
today the members include Jacksonville Jaguar football players
instead of oil tycoons. And a regular Joe still can't stop in for a
Budweiser in the bar. If you aren't a hotel guest or a club member,
you will be told, politely, to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Ponte Vedra, an unincorporated town on the south edge of
Jacksonville, still has a cachet that is bringing the wealthy.
</P>
<P>
   The town has two other resorts: the Lodge and Club at Ponte
Vedra (owned by Gate Petroleum Co., which owns the Ponte Vedra Inn
and Club) and the Marriott at Sawgrass.

 &HT;    WOODWORKING COLUMN: Plan, plan, plan
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   I have seen some curious things on rec.woodworking, the Internet
newsgroup for those involved in our craft, but the following query
is the strangest I ever did see.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm making a pretty simple coat rack with some cutoffs,'' a
gentleman wrote. ``It's the free-standing coat/hat rack kind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've cut the legs straight at 45 degree angles on each end.
Now I have to attach them to the post and am wondering what the
best way to do it would be. I've thought of a few ways to do it,
but none seem that great to me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any suggestions? I have a drill press, a router (no table), a
benchtop bandsaw, and a handful of hand tools.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a great lesson here, and it has nothing to do with how
to connect the legs of a coat rack to the stem. I can only suggest
that it's good this fellow didn't decide to build a boat instead of
a coat rack; he'd probably be asking how he's supposed to get it
out of his basement.
</P>
<P>
   Planning is a wonderful thing in most endeavors, and no less so
in woodworking and furnituremaking. One simply does not embark on a
project before deciding how everything is going to be done, and
when it is going to be done. A project's dimensions, among other
things, are predicated upon the joinery.
</P>
<P>
   That is the first thing this fellow has failed to grasp. Another
thing is that for a woodworker of his inexperience, there is n o
pretty simple coat rack. Oh, sure, it seems simple at first - after
all, it's just a long stick with some kind of base or legs, isn't
it? Cut a few pieces of wood and there you are.
</P>
<P>
   And, indeed, there he is, with one long piece of wood and a few
short pieces and not much of an idea what to do with them.
</P>
<P>
   Now, I happen to have experience with coat racks. I built one
once, for my eldest daughter. Unfortunately it has been a long
time, and she and the coat rack are now in Buffalo, N.Y., and I
cannot remember the exact way I joined the legs to the upright. I
have the vague memory that it was a fairly fancy joint discovered
in a book or a magazine, specific to the joining of coat rack legs.
</P>
<P>
   This fellow doesn't say how many legs he's planning on attaching
-- three or four -- but I suspect it's four. Judging from his list
of equipment, it's unreasonable to expect that he can prepare the
upright to receive three legs, although three would be the more
desirable configuration.
</P>
<P>
   Did someone ask why? Because the tripod is self-leveling. Four
legs may wobble on an uneven surface, but three are not likely to.
</P>
<P>
   On to the joinery. If his dimensions are critical, and one
assumes that since he has cut both ends of the legs to a 45-degree
angle that they are now at those dimensions, then there is only one
feasible method of joining them to the upright. That would be with
splines, separately cut slices of wood about a quarter of an inch
thick to be glued into slots in both the leg and the upright.
</P>
<P>
   This may, in fact, be the best practical method he has.. The
best way available to him at this point would be sliding dovetails,
but since he has no router table I wouldn't suggest it. Mortise and
tenon, the next best route, is almost as impractical with the
equipment at hand. Next week we'll look at the best way to do it
with the tools he's got.

services at the church he founded 13 years ago. Now, this wired

   GWTW-ART _ For years, artist Armand Seguso's descendants have

thinks MGM's art department may have simply discarded or misplaced
the oils. But Armand Seguso owned the rights to the original works,
his grandson said. It's possible he might have painted over the
canvases, or thrown them out himself. (Schwan, Palm Beach Post)

   CARDINAL _ In 1993, Cardinal Joseph Bernardin made international

millions. Three years later he faced his own death from pancreatic
cancer with the same serenity. On July 7, PBS will air a

includes insights from writers, theologians, and the family and
friends of Bernardin. (Blake, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) ETA 8

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW SMYRNA BEACH, Fla. _ The only thing standing between George
Johnson's house and the advancing monster is a barbed wire fence
and three firefighters. A sullen mass of yellow smoke rolls and
roils upward from deep in the woods and scrub behind Johnson's
home.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Johnson points. There, there it is, he says.
</P>
<P>
   And a lick of yellow flame leaps up a pine tree far off in the
woods, then another, then a line of yellow paints an ugly swath
that stretches away for hundreds of yards.
</P>
<P>
   The fire exhales a searing heat that billows invisibly across
Johnson's parched lawn. And the noise. A snapping and hissing
cacophony.
</P>
<P>
   The afternoon sun overhead is as high as it ever gets at these
latitudes, but an ocher smudge is the only hint of its existence.
The sky is heavy, dour, the color of an undertaker's overcoat.
</P>
<P>
   All of Volusia County, Florida, is wrapped in a thick cowl of
smoke. It drifts among trees like a Carolina morning mist. It hangs
in the air, on clothes. It sears the eyes and throat. Horses in
paddocks shake their heads and stomp and pace skittishly in the
gritty gloom.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole county's burning,'' says one of the three
firefighters.
</P>
<P>
   His name is Chuck Lupo, a strike team task force leader with
Palm Beach County Fire and Rescue. He lives in Lake Worth. His
partners on a small red pumper truck are Jim Meyer and Jim Parent,
both from St. Lucie County Fire and Rescue. They've been working
the fires for three days and nights.
</P>
<P>
   The fires jump around the county like fleas on a dog. Lupo,
Meyer and Parent chase them. They've had little sleep. They're
black with soot made greasy by sweat. Their eyes are streaked red
and yellow.
</P>
<P>
   More than two dozen fires burned in the county Wednesday. Some
were a few acres in size, others a few square miles. One thousand
bulldozers and pumpers from as far away as New Mexico are arrayed
against the blazes. The firefighters don't so much battle the fires
as try to contain them with fire breaks bulldozed behind homes and
along the perimeter.
</P>
<P>
   But the flaming yellow lines snap like whips, this direction one
minute, over there the next, across the road a moment later. A
shift in the wind and everything changes. And people like George
Johnson hope Lupo can hold the line because a barbed wire fence
isn't worth a damn against this trespasser.
</P>
<P>
   Lupo has used his radio to call for a bulldozer to enlarge the
fire break behind Johnson's house, but the dozer is somewhere else
on the line. Lupo knows that this side of the fire runs on for
about 600 yards, but he has no idea where the other side is or who
is on that line or what the conditions are. Or where the bulldozer
is. He goes off on foot in search of earth-moving equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Meyer and Parent slip cloth masks over their faces, pull on
their helmets and begin tugging hose off the pumper. They have
maybe 1,000 gallons of water on the truck, just enough to keep the
fire from consuming them and the truck if it leaps the fire break.
</P>
<P>
   ``There isn't enough water in the county to put these fires
out,'' says Parent. ``We need rain, not just showers, but rain,
days of rain, buckets and sheets of rain.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he and Meyer wade into the fire to douse an exploding
bramble patch that is spewing embers skyward in every direction.
</P>
<P>
   The smoke is so thick you lose your bearings in seconds. Only
the uncoiled hose points the way out. The fire truck becomes a red
smear in the smoke, then disappears. You know up is up and down is
down, but that's it.
</P>
<P>
   Flames on the left lick at palmetto palms, and on the right they
shoot up a stand of pine trees. A dried swamp has slowed the fire's
progress directly in front, but now it's curling around the sides
of the bog, flanking the firemen.
</P>
<P>
   Everything is closing in, and when you gulp the air for relief
you get no air. Just hot and aching lungs. Your head throbs in
minutes. There is only heat. Choking, crushing heat. And the noise,
sickening, steady. It's like listening to a diesel engine with a
stethoscope.
</P>
<P>
   It's so dry the dirt burns.
</P>
<P>
   Where the bulldozer has uprooted trees the root balls burn. The
soil is like talc and when you kick it up near the fire it puffs
into flame. The tops and sides of your feet feel the heat before
your soles, but when your soles start to cook it's past time to get
out. A spider flees its web a few seconds before the heat melts it.
You wonder where the deer went. You especially wonder where the
rattlesnakes and water moccasins went.
</P>
<P>
   Then you wonder where the firemen went. They're at the end of
the hose, maybe 15 feet away and almost invisible.
</P>
<P>
   Meyer and Parent follow the hose out of the woods. They decide
to back the pumper down the fire break to allow the bulldozer
access. To the west the sky is black, but not from the fires.
</P>
<P>
   A massive thunderhead forms a strange backdrop to the burning
forest. Blue flashes of lightning backlight the scene, but the
sound of thunder is swallowed by the fury of the fire. The cloud
promises rain, but it's lying.
</P>
<P>
   As if to taunt the firemen, a single large drop of water splats
on the dirty windshield of the pumper. Another kicks up dust at
Parent's feet. Two drops. The firemen look upward, shake their
heads, get into the truck.
</P>
<P>
   Something else big and yellow is crashing through the
underbrush. But its 8-ton presence and growl are welcome. Brian
Forret is sitting at the controls of his Caterpillar. He's a lean
guy who is so covered with soot he looks like a mighty thin vein of
anthracite.
</P>
<P>
   He's come over from Port Richey to help. He's cut enough fire
breaks in the last two days to put a road building crew to shame.
</P>
<P>
   A fire break will work as long as the fire doesn't run right up
to it and jump over. Sometimes firefighters will start a fire along
the break to knock down vegetation the advancing fire could feed
on. Then, as the big fire approaches the break it finds no
nourishment. It slows and dies.
</P>
<P>
   Or, in the case of the fires near State Road 40 west of Daytona
Beach, the fires will race right over breaks, roads, swamps and
homes. It all depends on the wind, the undergrowth, the slope of
the land. Luck.
</P>
<P>
   George Johnson is lucky Wednesday. Lupo and his team keep the
fire caged in the woods. Forret widens the break with his bulldozer
and is last seen plowing the forest hundreds of yards to the north.
But the fire will try to outflank the break. It'll try to sneak
around and come at the houses from the other side of Western Road.
It won't quit.
</P>
<P>
   Neither will the firefighters.

   Jasper slaying suspect's tattoos point to prison gang
</P>
<P>
   By Mike Ward
</P>
<P>
   Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ One of the three ex-convicts suspected of
dragging a black man to death behind a pickup earlier this month in
Jasper wore a Klan tattoo that pictured a lynching victim, a Senate
committee was told.
</P>
<P>
   The disclosure, providing the first detail of what investigators
earlier had characterized only as tattoos ``consistent with the
practices of white supremacy,'' came during a recent hearing into
the growing criminal influence of prison gangs across Texas.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Royce West, chairman of the legislative inquiry,
quizzed Sammy Buentello, the prison system's chief gang
investigator, about ties between the three suspects in the Jasper
slaying and white-supremacist prison gangs that promote racial
hatred inside Texas' corrections system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did one have a tattoo of an African-American man hanging from
a tree?'' West asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes sir,'' Buentello answered, telling West that the suspect
did not have the tattoo when he entered the prison system. Prison
officials are unsure if he got it while in prison or after he was
paroled.
</P>
<P>
   The tattooed suspect was not identified by name during the
hearing. And few other details were made public. But according to
others familiar with the case, the tattoo is a very small part of a
mural that covers one suspect's arm. In the image are a duck
dressed as a Ku Klux Klansman, with his hood in one hand, and a
silhouetted figure hanging from a branch of a tree to one side of
the duck.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect also has an ``Aryan Pride'' tatoo, featuring an
eagle and a Confederate flag, on one of his sides and a shield with
the words ``Death before Dishonor'' and ``C.K.A.'' on another spot.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities believe those initials stand for Confederate Knights
of America, a small white-supremacist group in Texas prisons. Two
of the three suspects in the Jasper killing were suspected of
associating with prison gang members but were not thought to be
members, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   During the hearing, Buentello and a string of other law
enforcement officials repeatedly sounded the same warning: Prison
gangs are growing more violent and more criminal, both inside and
outside of Texas prisons.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the approximately 5,000 confirmed members of 10
gangs, Buentello estimated there are up to 6,000 more convicts who
are affiliated with street gang groups that are more loosely
organized _ but no less violent.
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    No fireworks for Florida Fourth
 &HT;    By Ron Hayes
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ fires rage on, so fireworks now are
illegal in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Lawton Chiles recently signed an executive order making it
a crime to sell or use fireworks throughout the state, except for
permitted public displays.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so dangerous. Obviously, this is not something we want to
do. This is a little like taking away Christmas,'' Chiles said in
Miami. ``I don't know that Florida has had to do this before. These
fires are unprecedented.''
</P>
<P>
   The order came just 11 days before the Fourth of July, but after
a month in which 158,000 acres of woodland have been lost to fires
sparked by unusually hot, dry weather.
</P>
<P>
   ``Florida has 2,472 men and women who have been fighting these
fires for the past four weeks,'' Chiles said. ``We've been blessed
we haven't lost any firefighters' lives, and we must do everything
we can to protect these courageous people.''
</P>
<P>
   Chiles, Agriculture Commissioner Bob Crawford and State Fire
Marshal Bill Nelson decided against prohibiting municipal fireworks
displays because some coastal cities could argue that their shows
would explode over the ocean and pose no fire threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can be a Grinch, but you can be a reasonable Grinch,''
Crawford said.
</P>
<P>
   In Palm Beach County, most municipalities said their fireworks
celebrations would go as scheduled, though Greenacres rescheduled
its display for Aug. 23 to make it part of its Street Beat event.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our major concern is the area that lies west of Community
Park,'' said City Manager Rich Olson, noting the heavily wooded
areas adjacent to the park. ``It would be extremely hard, if those
areas caught fire, for us to fight them.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Gabel, community events coordinator for West Palm Beach,
said the city planned to keep its $35,000 display.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, we do ours over the Intracoastal and we'll have the
fire marshal and a couple of trucks on site just to be safe,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   By mid-afternoon Thursday, retail fireworks outlets had already
stopped selling.
</P>
<P>
   At Phantom Fireworks on Forest Hill Boulevard, employees watched
a would-be customer being interviewed on TV, answered continual
phone calls and waited to get the official word from company
lawyers. But they knew what was coming.
</P>
<P>
   ``What choice do we have?'' said manager Ira Schwartz. ``We're
not like Publix or Winn-Dixie, where they can just take stuff off
the shelves. We're out of business.''
</P>
<P>
   The store, normally open until 10 p.m., would have gone to its
pre-holiday schedule and begun staying open until midnight.
Instead, employees will either ship stock to stores out of Florida
or pack their bags and head for those stores to work. Ten part-time
workers are out of jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Phantom is a national chain with five Florida stores. How much
will the ban cost the business?
</P>
<P>
   ``Think of this as the last 10 days before Christmas,'' Schwartz
said, ``and ask Burdine's how it would affect them.''
</P>
<P>
   Galaxy Fireworks of Boca Raton owner Ronald Hunnewell didn't
open for business in anticipation of the ban. The side panels of
his tent in a parking lot at Boca Rio Road and Glades Road were
lowered and the tables that had been full of sparklers and flying
rockets Wednesday were cleared.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's understandable why they have bans,'' Hunnewell said.
``But it certainly hurts financially.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunnewell said that although he'll store his merchandise and
hope the ban is lifted, he doesn't expect it will be.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of hard to be optimistic at this point,'' Hunnewell
said.
</P>
<P>
   As drafted, Chiles' order bans fireworks, including hand-held
sparklers, in each of the state's 15 ``fire'' districts in which
the drought index is over 400 on a scale from zero to 800. That
description currently describes the entire state.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main thing we are concerned about is thousands and
thousands of individuals, maybe most of them children, using
fireworks on top of the tinderbox that is Florida,'' Crawford said.
</P>
<P>
   The executive order, which remains in effect for 60 days unless
it's lifted, makes selling or using fireworks a second-degree
misdemeanor that carries a punishment of 60 days in jail or $500
fine. But Chiles said he expects good citizens to help make it
work.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would think that the people would be aware of the ban, and
if you see your neighbor setting off fireworks you would be telling
your neighbor you really shouldn't be doing that, you'll burn down
the neighborhood,'' the governor said. ``I would think that would
be the strongest enforcement.''

   COLUMBUS, Ohio _ Consumers in the Miami Valley and across the
Midwest should conserve electricity to ward off widespread power
outages that could come as a result of hot weather and idled power
plants, Ohio's governor and utility officials said in response to
the recent heat wave.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hot and humid weather from Kansas City to Philadelphia is
a major problem and it could not have come at a worse time,'' said
Dick Kimmins, spokesman for the Public Utility Commission of Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is it unseasonably hot, but officials said several
major electric-generating plants in Ohio are now off-line. The
combination is causing power interruptions for some Ohio industrial
users and could cause temporary power outages for residential
customers, particularly in northern Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as the hot and humid weather conditions persist, the
Midwest as whole is going to have to conserve,'' said Neil
Costello, managing director of Dayton Power &AMP; Light Co.
</P>
<P>
   Temperatures are expected to stay in the 90s into the weekend in
the Dayton area, and Costello said some major industrial users have
been asked to use their own generators in order to conserve power
needed by the Miami Valley region as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   Costello added, however, that even though power usage is now
more than 100 megawatts higher than last summer's peak of 2,840
megawatts, DP&AMP;L ``is not experiencing the types of problems being
experienced by other utilities.''
</P>
<P>
   All of DP&AMP;L's generating and distribution systems are on-line,
he said. ``We're going to continue to work around the clock to
deliver service.''
</P>
<P>
   Donna Valentine, area manager for Ohio Edison, which serves
customers from Ashland to Springfield, said the company is
considering using ``rolling outages'' as a last resort. The term
refers to shutting off the power to certain areas for two hours at
a time.
</P>
<P>
   That's necessary, in part, because a tornado Wednesday in the
area of the Davis-Besse plant in Ottawa County damaged a major
transmission line.
</P>
<P>
   If rolling outages are implemented, Valentine said the company
will give special consideration to hospitals and customers listed
as needing electricity for public health and safety reasons.
</P>
<P>
   She said Ohio Edison officials have told major car
manufacturers, steel customers and other manufacturers that their
power may be interrupted.
</P>
<P>
   They've also appealed to customers to shut off their air
conditioners if possible or at least turn the thermostat up to 78
degrees and take other conservation measurers.
</P>
<P>
   American Electric Power of Columbus and electric utilities
across Ohio have made similar appeals, as has Gov. George
Voinovich.
</P>
<P>
   Ann Marie Lewis, a spokeswoman for AEP, said its electrical
shortages have affected seven states, from Indiana to Tennessee.
She said the firm itself has shut down all unnecessary lights in
its buildings, turned off its elevators and unnecessary computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not something we face every day,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Voinovich also directed all government offices to conserve
electric power.
</P>
<P>
   ``Several major electric generating plants in Ohio are off-line
and a major transmission line was disabled,'' Voinovich said.
``These events, coupled with the hot, humid conditions across the
state, require both residential and commercial electric customers
to conserve.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Mike Dawson, spokesman for Voinovich, noted that the
problem could be worse. ``The governor can declare an energy
emergency. We're not at that point yet,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The problems with electricity were predicted in May by the East
Central Area Reliability Council, which in its seasonal assessment
said a potential for record electrical demand might exceed
available generation. The report cautioned that transmission
outages during periods of heavy power flow could result in local
area power interruptions.
</P>
<P>
   Edwin Kover, executive director of the Miami Valley Emergency
Management Agency, said the Red Cross normally opens up shelters if
power were to shut down here.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best thing, if power goes out, is to cool people down as
much as possible,'' he said. ``(We) would seek out large areas that
different communities have ... that we could use (as) the community
facility.''

 &HT;    Dam may separate salamanders from swimmers
 &HT;    By Laylan Copelin
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ As Austin officials drained water from Barton
Springs Pool recently, biologists with nets and plastic cups
scoured the exposed limestone and gravel pool bottom for stranded
salamanders, returning 10 of them to deep water.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Kirk Watson, showing off the pool's first cleaning in five
weeks, outlined what he hoped would become a permanent solution to
the conflict over the endangered species and the preservation of a
spring-fed swimming pool that has taken on iconic proportions for
many Central Texans. Yet the mayor declined to predict that the
plan, including a dam separating the shallow end from the deep end,
will resolve the controversy of how mankind and beast should
inhabit the same waters. ``This is Barton Springs,'' Watson said.
``I wouldn't say it's the last chapter. Who knows?''
</P>
<P>
   As if to prove his point, two swimmers at the press conference
challenged the proposed site of the dam, suggesting that at least
36 inches upstream would be better. The extra yard _ or about a
dozen adult salamanders laid end to end _ would put the dam just
beyond the one-eighth-mile marker, making it easier for swimmers to
measure their laps more precisely.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it's nit-picking,'' said Marilyn Prengler, a year-round
swimmer in the constant 68-degree water.
</P>
<P>
   Austin, after all, already has made a federal case out of the
salamander, which has been on the Endangered Species list since
last year, and how its home is cleaned for the benefit of the
thousands of human swimmers and waders.
</P>
<P>
   In a lawsuit, a federal judge this month refused to stop the
pool cleaning, saying it does not threaten the species. As an added
benefit, humans don't slip and fall on algae-coated rocks or become
hidden from the eyes of lifeguards when the normally clear water
turns murky after it rains.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday afternoon, however, a tractor hose broke, spreading
a cup of hydraulic fluid razor-thin over 800 gallons of water. The
spill, contained by silt fences, did not affect the salamander
habitat, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Now the City of Austin will go to the U.S. Fish &AMP; Wildlife
Service for a permit to make permanent changes in the pool,
including the dam, to minimize the impact of the cleanings on this
particular salamander, which lives only in Barton Springs.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal will be published, probably in July, and citizens
will be given 30 days to comment. Everything is negotiable,
including the 36 inches.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the wildlife service approved seven additional
experimental cleanings, enough to get the city through the summer
season, until the federal agency acts on the final permit this
fall. It also will teach biologists more about the care of
salamanders.
</P>
<P>
   If the permit is granted, city officials expect to close Barton
Springs Pool, probably in the winter, to build the dam and make
other changes. Among them:
</P>
<P>
   _ Make the ``beach area'' of the pool's deep end about 61/2 feet
deep. While the gravel-bottomed beach is not a beach _ it is
usually covered with 3 or 4 feet of water _ it is salamander
habitat.
</P>
<P>
   Deepening it will leave 6 inches of water over the bottom when
the deep end is drained for maintenance. Salamanders now get
stranded there when the water is lowered. Vegetation will be
planted on the new bottom for the salamanders.
</P>
<P>
   _ Establish a $45,000 yearly city fund for salamander research.
</P>
<P>
   Officials also are authorizing $10,000 this year to make up for
any damage to the species habitat.
</P>
<P>
   _ Close fissures _ the rocky outbreak where the springs flow
into the pool _ to swimmers and waders.
</P>
<P>
   City officials don't want people wading over the salamander
habitat.
</P>
<P>
   _ Install a pumping system to keep water over the fissures
whenever the water is lowered in the deep end. The system also will
be used during dry spells to pump water to other springs where
salamanders live.
</P>
<P>
   The most obvious change to the pool will be the dam, which will
be about 3 feet high. By separating the shallow and deep ends,
officials say, they can drain the pool 40 times a year to clear the
algae, leaving the deep end where salamanders live undisturbed
except for four annual cleanings.
</P>
<P>
   In the deep end, officials said, sediment and flooding debris
must be removed. A vacuum _ with a screen to keep salamanders from
being sucked up _ may be developed.
</P>
<P>
   The dam will have gates in the bottom to allow water to flow
between the shallow and deep ends. Screens on the gates will keep
the salamanders from migrating into the shallow end. During the
cleanings, the gates will be closed and the water from the shallow
end will be flushed through drains on the limestone bottom.
</P>
<P>
   Austin lawyer Robert Kleeman, who represented clients who tried
to stop the cleanings with a federal lawsuit, reserved judgment on
most of the measures, but he endorsed the dam.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds like we're making progress,'' he said. ``We were
lowering the whole pool just to clean the shallow end.''

 &HT;    Falling aquifer forces conservation measures
 &HT;    By Harry Thomas
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ Citing falling water levels in the Edwards Aquifer, the
City of San Marcos and the Edwards Aquifer Authority have imposed
mandatory water conservation measures for residents and some
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The Edwards Aquifer Authority began its stricter Stage II
conservation rules. They apply to Edwards Aquifer pumps in Bexar
County and parts of Comal, Hays, Caldwell and Guadalupe counties,
with more severe restrictions on San Marcos.
</P>
<P>
   Under the authority's measures, residents in affected areas can
water yards two days a week. In cities, residents' watering days
will be set by local water utilities, while rural residents can
water on Wednesdays and Saturdays.
</P>
<P>
   San Marcos residents can water one day a week, either Tuesday or
Thursday, based on their home address.
</P>
<P>
   Aquifer authority officials called for the tougher measures
after water levels in the Edwards Aquifer _ the whale-shaped
underground limestone reservoir that stretches from Kyle to about
100 miles west of San Antonio _ dropped below 642 feet above mean
sea level. The Bexar County Index Well was at 641.9 feet Thursday
morning, said authority spokeswoman Jeanne Janes. The portion of
the Edwards Aquifer that feeds Barton Springs in Austin is
geologically separate.
</P>
<P>
   San Marcos City Manager Larry Gilley called for the stricter
steps when the level was at 642.2 feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``As this hot, dry weather continues, San Marcos residents are
urged to redouble their efforts to conserve water,'' said Gilley.
``We could encounter some extremely severe conditions this summer,
and we want to do all we can to protect our water supply, the
springs and the river.''
</P>
<P>
   The San Marcos restrictions also affect local businesses.
Restaurant-goers will receive water only upon request, and
commercial nurseries will be allowed to water only from 6 to 10
a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Other San Marcos and Edwards Aquifer restrictions include a
prohibition on the use of unrecycled water for fountains,
street-cleanings and private car washes.
</P>
<P>
   In San Marcos, commercial and residential violators can be fined
$50 to $200. Fines under the aquifer authority's plan were
unavailable.
</P>
<P>
   In Austin, the city's water conservation efforts remain
voluntary. Residents are being asked to water their lawns once
every five days, based on the last number in their address.

been looking for his art, which was used in the original poster and

thinks MGM's art department may have simply discarded or misplaced
the oils. But Armand Seguso owned the rights to the original works,
his grandson said. It's possible he might have painted over the
canvases, or thrown them out himself. (Schwan, Palm Beach Post)

 &HT;    When the Klan wants you
 &HT;    By Rowland Nethaway
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ I hate to miss it, but I'm going to skip this
weekend's Ku Klux Klan rally in Jasper.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing like a Klan rally to get the old juices flowing.
</P>
<P>
   The Klan knows this, of course, which is why two Texas Klan
groups decided to hold a joint rally Saturday in Jasper, the
8,000-population timber community in East Texas where three white
ex-cons have been accused of torturing and dragging to death a
49-year-old Jasper black man.
</P>
<P>
   People who say the Klan's timing couldn't be worse don't
understand the Klan. From the Klan's point of view, the timing is
perfect. From the point of view of any American with reasonable
mental health, there is no good time to hold a Klan rally.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the New Black Panther Party share with the Klan an
understanding of the ingredients needed to attract attention.
</P>
<P>
   The Dallas-based group conducted an armed rally and march in
Jasper on the day murder victim James Byrd Jr. was buried. They
knew the nation's press would be crawling all over Jasper that day
eager to spread their tit-for-tat solution to racial violence.
</P>
<P>
   After witnessing the public-relations coup enjoyed by the New
Black Panther Party, the Klan groups announced they also would
rally in Jasper.
</P>
<P>
   The beleaguered citizens of Jasper, both black and white, just
wish everyone would go away and leave them alone. If they weren't
at each other's throats before this tragedy, which they weren't, it
will be a miracle if they can stay that way. Actually, Jasper's
African-American mayor has led his citizens in prayer asking for
heavenly help to maintain racial harmony.
</P>
<P>
   Rev. Jesse Jackson was on the scene in front of TV cameras
before benumbed Jasper residents had time to absorb the tragedy.
Jackson was first in a legion of national figures and politicians
to descend on Jasper.
</P>
<P>
   Texas NAACP leaders called a public meeting of the executive
board in a Jasper church when the Klan groups plan to rally.
</P>
<P>
   The new peace-and-harmony Klan would love to be seen preaching
white pride and nonviolence while their opponents are seen as
profane and
</P>
<P>
   violent. And they might get their wish.
</P>
<P>
   After my column advised readers to not believe the
peace-and-harmony message now being preached by Grand Dragon
Michael Lowe of the Texas Knights of the KKK, a leader of a rival
Klan called to say an armed New Black Panthers planned to return
for the Klan rally. He agreed that Lowe's peace-and-harmony message
was phony.
</P>
<P>
   Another person called me a racist for comparing Lowe's history
of racism with his new sheetless, politically correct message.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, I've covered a number of public Klan rallies. I
know how easily Klan speakers provoke crowds and stir the juices.
That's what they want to do.
</P>
<P>
   The press is there to report, but especially to see if things
get out of hand. We eagerly gather the most provocative quotes and
pass them along to our readers or viewers. We certainly don't look
for bland quotes.
</P>
<P>
   Hurled epithets are good. Hurled bricks are even better,
strictly from a professional reporting point of view, of course.
</P>
<P>
   If the confrontation erupts into a bloody free-for-all,
reporters and photographers on the scene have a chance to have
their words and pictures distributed nationwide. Something like
that could mean prizes, awards, raises and promotions. It's also
darn exciting and can be worked nicely into conversations for a
lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   That's why I nearly decided to go to the Jasper Klan rally. But
I know that's what the Klan wants me to do. It's a judgment call,
but this time my judgment tells me to stay home and not give the
Klan what it wants.

CLINTON AND AIDES RESPOND SOFTLY TO CHINA'S ARREST OF DISSIDENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: SUBS 3rd graf to reflect dissidents were released)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ President Clinton responded cautiously Friday to the
Chinese government's ham-handed roundup of prominent dissidents in
the opening days of his historic visit and said the arrests
underlined the importance of his policy of engaging China.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese authorities' detention of at least three political
activists in the city of Xian where Clinton began his nine-day
visit played right into the hands of the president's critics back
home who insist that his policy of ``constructive engagement'' with
China is a one-way street.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton called reports of the arrests ``disturbing'' and added:
``If true, they represent not China at its best and not China
looking forward but looking backward.'' The dissidents later were
released, according to organizations that monitor human rights.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials tried to minimize the impact of
the seizures at the outset of 11 hours of U.S.-China summitry
following a controversial welcoming ceremony in Tiananmen Square.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is the first American president to visit China since the
murderous crackdown on pro-democracy activists in and around
Tinanamen Square in 1989. The suppression claimed the lives of up
to 800 unarmed demonstrators and bystanders.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said China's latest detentions merely underscore the
necessity of his mission to persuade Chinese authorities to expand
individuals' political freedoms to match the shift to a burgeoning
free enterprise system.
</P>
<P>
   The arrests make ``it all the more important that we continue to
work with the Chinese and to engage them,'' Clinton said in Xian
before flying to Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has insisted that privately conveying U.S. concerns
about Chinese human rights has paid off with prisoner releases and
expanded U.S.-Chinese trade.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials said there was not a reliable count on the number
of dissidents detained or arrested. One U.S. official, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said White House officials regard the
crackdown merely as an effort by local governments to stem
potential protests by activists who might seek to use Clinton's
visit as protection for their activities.
</P>
<P>
   National Security Adviser Samuel ``Sandy'' Berger also
downplayed Clinton administration concerns, insisting that the
ill-timed detentions were ``not directed at'' Clinton because
``this happens generally in connection with these types of
visits.''
</P>
<P>
   Berger added that the detentions were ``not of the scale that
has happened before.''
</P>
<P>
   Only when pressed by reporters did Berger begin to express
indignation.
</P>
<P>
   The arrests are ``thoroughly unacceptable,'' Berger said. The
Chinese government's explanation in response to inquiries by
Ambassador James Sasser ``so far has not been terribly
satisfactory,'' Berger said, adding: ``They dispute the facts or
otherwise explain these incidents away.''
</P>
<P>
   Berger declared at one point: ``People are not debris to be
swept up for a visitor and we have expressed our concern about this
to the Chinese government.''
</P>
<P>
   Berger, who has visited China twice in recent months to set the
stage for Clinton's visit, said Chinese authorities approached the
visit with a ``combination of excitement, anticipation and fear''
that triggered ``the instinct of some...to let their desire for
order overwhelm their ability to permit expression.''
</P>
<P>
   Aides said Clinton planned to privately press Chinese President
Jiang Zemin to release more than 2,000 imprisoned Chinese citizens
who are either in labor re-education camps or prison, including
about 150 residents of Beijing imprisoned for their roles in the
Tiananmen Square movement.
</P>
<P>
   Berger hinted that Chinese authorities would release additional
dissidents from prison after Clinton's departure, adding: ``I would
not anticipate that we would see the fruits of those discussions
while we're here.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's arrival in the ancient Chinese capital of Xian late
Thursday appeared to trigger the detention of at least three
advocacy of democracy and the forced flight of a fourth activist.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and his advisers have resisted appeals to meet privately
with Chinese dissidents _ claiming that the rendezvous could irk
the Beijing regime and provoke retaliatory arrests after he leaves.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (STORY MAY END HERE - OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yang Hai, a resident of Xian and one of 70 Chinese who signed an
open letter appealing for Clinton to meet with dissidents during
his visit, was detained Thursday shortly after ABC News'
correspondent Sam Donaldson tried to interview him at an Xian
hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese authorities detained two other Xian-area activists, as
well, according to the Information Center of Human Rights and
Democratic Movement in China, based in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   Yan Jun, a Xian resident who signed the letter, and Li Zhiying,
who lives near Xian, were detained Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese police also picked up Fu Sheng, a resident of Xian who
signed the appeal to Clinton, and sent him by train to Qingdao on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the reasons that I came here was to discuss both
privately and publicly issues of personal freedom,'' Clinton told
reporters on Friday as he prepared to meet with residents of the
village of Xiahe, adjacent to the site of the buried 2,200-year-old
terra cotta warriors outside Xian. ``So I think it's very important
for me to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton says his efforts have won the release of two prominent
Chinese dissidents in the past eight months. Wei Jingsheng was
freed from prison and sent into exile in the United States last
November shortly after Clinton raised his case during the state
visit to the United States by Chinese President Jiang Zemin.
</P>
<P>
   Wang Dan was freed and sent into U.S. exile in April.

ANALYSTS WARN RUSSIA COULD SPLIT APART 
</HEADLINE>
   News Analysis  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BERNARD D. KAPLAN  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ In Russia, history never lies very far beneath the
surface of events.
</P>
<P>
   So President Boris Yeltsin's call this week for strong
anti-crisis measures and his warning of political unrest unless
they are enacted have evoked memories of the civil war that
followed the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   With the Yeltsin government caught in a deepening economic
morass as interest rates have risen to 150 percent, some analysts
expressed fear that the vast Russian Federation may be stretched to
the breaking point and could even split apart.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian leader did not specifically refer to last month's
overwhelming election of former Gen. Alexander Lebed, Yeltsin's
arch foe and rival, as the governor of the Siberian province of
Krasnovar. But some experts see that event as a disturbing sign of
tensions between the regime in Moscow and the distant hinterland,
which could produce an explosion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Conditions are bad for many Russians, but the further one
travels from the capital, the worse they get,'' according to Serge
Laplante, a Russian specialist at France's National Research
Council. ``And conditions are worst of all in Siberia even though
Russia's natural resources are in greatest supply there.''
</P>
<P>
   Laplante cited the millions of Siberian miners and other workers
who have gone unpaid for months, and in some cases, years. He added
that the general breakdown in public services, such as hospital
care, is more extensive in Siberia than anywhere else in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   The analyst, who has traveled widely in Siberia, explained that
``the Siberians increasingly think of themselves as a separate and
neglected people. For them, Moscow is very distant and has little
interest in their well-being and might as well be the capital of
another nation.''
</P>
<P>
   He recalled that Siberia's disenchantment with the last Soviet
ruler, Mikhail Gorbachev, contributed to his downfall in 1991.
Siberians are now equally fed up with Yeltsin who, like Gorbachev,
hasn't fulfilled his promises to them, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tension between Siberia and European Russia has always existed
although the vast majority of Siberians are ethnic Russians and
many of their families have been settled there for centuries. The
resentment tends to be strongest when the national government is at
its weakest, according to Russian-born analyst Nicholas Chomsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``After Lenin and the Communists seized power in 1917, Siberia
became a stronghold of counter-revolutionary forces,'' he
explained. ``For a time, in 1919 and 1920, an anticommunist admiral
named Alexander Kolchak had almost all of Siberia under his control
and seemed likely to overthrow the Communists by marching on
European Russia from there.''
</P>
<P>
   Kolchak failed only because of his own military incompetence,
Chomsky said, adding that ``many Siberians haven't forgotten that
for a while they seemed to have their destiny in their own hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Chomsky added that ``Siberia's abiding complaint is that it
hardly benefits from its own mineral wealth, that it should be rich
but instead is poor. There is little doubt many Siberians would
jump at the chance of independence.''

   SAN DIEGO _ Regina Brett is fighting breast cancer with courage,

Society of Newspaper Columnists _ with wrath. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   She wears a baseball cap to cover her once-beautiful hair, now
gone. And she's intimate with cancer's terror. Which is why this
Akron, Ohio, Beacon Journal columnist is so angry at Boston Globe
columnist Patricia Smith, if that's her real name. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Smith has wounded Regina, me and every other newspaper columnist
by doing precisely what we are required never to do: pass off
fiction as fact. She's now admitted it and lost her job. Good
riddance. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first heard what Patricia Smith had done,'' Regina told
the NSNC's recent annual conference here, ``I felt sorry for her
for sabotaging such an incredible career. But then. . .as I was
trying to put in my contact lens, my lower eyelashes came tumbling
out. My eyes would soon be as bald as my head, thanks to the chemo
that is trying to eradicate the cancer in my breast. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The tears fell, probably washing another 10 eyelashes out. But
instead of feeling sad, I began to feel outraged _ outraged at how
a writer could make up a cancer patient, make up what it feels like
to live with cancer, to lose parts of yourself bit by bit, hair by
hair, eyelash by eyelash. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``How dare Patricia Smith pretend to know what it is like,
pretend to know so well? . . . What arrogance to think she could be
more eloquent and accurate in expressing the fear, pain and despair
the diagnosis brings.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No wonder we elected this eloquent columnist our NSNC
president. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   She's right. Smith has betrayed not only the trusting readers of
the prose she crafted with apparent grace and beauty (and, we now
know, guile), but she has betrayed the very profession Regina and I
practice and try to improve and challenge through the NSNC. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Smith is like the scientist who fakes research to receive
continued grants. She has forced other columnists _ just as the
phony scientist forces other researchers _ to defend their craft,
to ask readers not to imagine her deceit is typical of our work. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It would be understandable, of course, if readers simply assumed
now that all columnists routinely make up quotes and create
non-existent people so we can do what Smith called ``slam home some
salient point.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And I won't claim Smith is the only guilty columnist ever, but I
will say that the hundreds of columnists I know and respect would
never try to slip some undisclosed fiction past readers. Such
deception is not at all like major league pitchers throwing spit
balls or hitters corking their bats _ sins everyone winks at.
Nobody in my profession who cares even a little about ethics does
what Smith has admitted doing. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Please understand that I'm not saying columnists don't sometimes
have fun saying goofy things for humorous effect _ things they and
their readers know to be false. Heck, I myself have called William
Shakespeare Greek. I've said Warren G. Harding wrote the
Constitution. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That sort of silliness goes on a lot, and readers recognize it,
especially because we always tell them what we're up to, either
directly or indirectly. Dave Barry of the Miami Herald, in fact,
does this so often he's forced to tell readers when he's
(ital)not(ital) making up some fact. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But that's not what got Smith in trouble. Rather, in serious
pieces about serious subjects, she simply created people and their
quotes ex nihilo. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's tempting to wonder what sort of overly trusting editors
Smith had. Or to puzzle over why SOMEONE didn't catch on and
confront Smith about writing fiction. But it finally doesn't matter
who let her sins slip through. She's to blame. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We in the newspaper business have nothing without our
credibility. And we forfeit it far too often by erring through
laziness. But those are sins of sloppiness, not deceit. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Smith's colleague at the Boston Globe, Pulitzer prize winner
Eileen McNamara, who was our NSNC keynote speaker, said all this
well: ``Credibility is all we have. It's absolutely the currency we
exchange with the public.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Good column writing requires risks. We must be willing to offend
readers as we do our most important job _ making them think. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As Neil Morgan of the San Diego Union-Tribune says: ``If you
don't get out ahead of your readers there's not much reason to come
to work. If you get too far ahead there's (ital)no(ital) reason to
come to work.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But that balancing act should never lead a columnist to give
readers fiction masquerading as fact. Columnists who do that are a
disgrace. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Smith says she will ``write as long as I breathe, despite the
dire predictions that this indiscretion spells the end of my
career.'' There she goes again. It wasn't an ``indiscretion.'' It
was lying. And if she writes again, it should not be for a
newspaper. She has forfeited that privilege. &QL;
</P>
<P>

WHERE'S THE BOOM ECONOMY FOR OLDER GUYS? 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN LYNCH  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Do you need an assistant, the guy asked me over
the phone?
</P>
<P>
   Well, no, I said. I have enough trouble supervising myself.
Besides, I worked as managing editor of my home newspaper for 15
years. I understand how much fun it is to be responsible for other
people, which is not much. Also, I'm not an employer; I'm an
employee. I don't decide if I get an assistant. My corporate
masters control that decision.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, they haven't tried to force an assistant on me, and
I'm grateful.
</P>
<P>
   Well, the guy said, he figured he'd give it a shot. He's a
bright, well-educated guy of 53 who used to make a six-figure
income. Despite his master's degree and his years of management
experience, he's now out of work.
</P>
<P>
   He likes to do research and write. He'd hoped that maybe he
could find a home with this column. I felt terrible when I had to
tell him I had nothing for him.
</P>
<P>
   He told me, ``It's amazing what happens with some of these
companies once they see me ... They clearly don't want to hire a
guy my age. This one guy with a company in Colonie (N.Y.), once he
laid eyes on me, sweat was pouring off his forehead. It was clear
that he thought I was there to investigate his operation for age
discrimination.''
</P>
<P>
   My caller was in the medical lab business until he got
downsized. Luckily, he has a wife with a good job who's keeping the
household afloat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had interviews,'' he told me, ``where I'm sitting in the
lobby with somebody who's much younger. And they've come out and
called my name, and they've walked toward the younger guy. And this
younger guy is maybe sitting there waiting for a ride or something.
And then they see me.
</P>
<P>
   ``And, mind you, I've dyed my hair. I'm maybe two-thirds gray,
but you wouldn't know it. But you can only hide so much on your
resume. How many years do you want to cut off? It's fascinating to
watch.''
</P>
<P>
   I told him I wished I could help. I've looked into this before.
Men in their 50s, especially their late 50s, are simply
disappearing from the work force, according to U.S. Labor
Department figures. They get downsized out and can't find anything.
They have working wives. So, they finally say the hell with it.
They stay home and watch Oprah and brood. And, eventually, they
just disappear from the work force statistics. It's fairly grim
stuff, especially when you hear all this talk about what a booming
economy we have going.
</P>
<P>
   That's true if you're an owner. Not if you're a worker, though.
</P>
<P>
   John Zogby, a pollster, tells me that he routinely asks a
question in economic polling. Do you make more or less than you did
in your last job, Zogby asks? For a long time, about 25 percent of
respondents said, ``Less.''
</P>
<P>
   Then it dropped to half that in a few years. Zogby couldn't
figure that out, so he changed the question.
</P>
<P>
   He now asks if you make more or less than you did in a previous
job. The number shot back up to around 25 percent. He concluded
that people had been downsized twice _ especially older guys with
less seniority and a greater likelihood of driving up some
employer's health costs.
</P>
<P>
   I told my caller about a wonderful cartoon that appeared in the
Wall Street Journal last year. A kid in a cap and gown with a
diploma in his hand was talking to his father.
</P>
<P>
   The kid was saying, ``Hey, Dad, guess what? I've just been hired
for the job you were downsized out of.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, my caller told me. That pretty much sums it up.
</P>

SUPREME COURT DECISIONS FAVOR VICTIMS OF SEX HARASSMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN FREEDMAN  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court made it significantly harder
Friday for private and public employers to defend themselves
against sexual harassment charges by claiming they were unaware of
what lower-level supervisors were doing.
</P>
<P>
   In a pair of 7-2 decisions, the court wrapped up its 1997-1998
term by ruling that employers cannot use this defense because the
federal civil rights law that bars employer sex discrimination or
harassment equates an employer with his or her ``agents'' or
supervisors.
</P>
<P>
   So if a supervisor engages in harassment, the employer is
subject to ``vicarious liability,'' the court said.
</P>
<P>
   The justices also made it more difficult for employers to claim
they are not liable in cases of threats by a supervisor to an
employee to have sex or else if the threats were not carried out
and the victim's career did not suffer.
</P>
<P>
   In its decisions, the court promulgated a new standard for
determining what kinds of defenses employers can raise in such
cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a person with supervisory authority discriminates in
terms and conditions of subordinates' employment, his actions
necessarily draw upon his superior position over people who report
to him,'' Justice David Souter wrote. ``An employee generally
cannot check a supervisor's abusive conduct the same way that she
might deal with abuse from a co-worker.''
</P>
<P>
   Souter's opinion involved charges by Beth Ann Faragher that when
she worked as a lifeguard in Boca Raton, Fla. between 1985 and
1990, supervisors had constantly made lewd remarks to her and had
engaged in ``uninvited and offensive touching.'' One supervisor
told her to ``date me or clean the toilets for a year.''
</P>
<P>
   The other case involved a Chicago saleswoman, Kimberly Ellerth,
who quit her job with Burlington Industries Inc. in 1994 after 15
months because a supervisor had told her to ``loosen up'' and
warned, ``I could make your life very hard or very easy at
Burlington.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellerth's lawsuit said she quit because of the harassment by
Theodore Slowik, a New York-based vice president of sales and
marketing in her division. He actually supervised Ellerth's
supervisor but in the course of business dealt with her on a
regular basis.
</P>
<P>
   Ellerth, now a homemaker in Belvidere, Ill., alleged that Slowik
touched her inappropriately and told offensive jokes. She said he
once told her, ``You know, Kim, I could make your life very hard or
very easy at Burlington.'' But he never followed through with the
threat.
</P>
<P>
   Writing for the court in that case, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy
found that Burlington was responsible. ``An employer is subject to
vicarious liability to a victimized employee for an actionable
hostile environment created by a supervisor with immediate (or
successively higher) authority over the employee.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that ``when no tangible employment action is taken, a
defending employer may raise an affirmative defense to liability or
damages, subject to proof by a preponderance of the evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   But to succeed in such a defense, employers would have to show
they ``exercised reasonable care to prevent or correct promptly any
sexually harassing behavior'' and that ``the employee unreasonably
failed to take advantage of any preventive or corrective
opportunities provided by the employer or to avoid harm
otherwise,'' Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   Dissenting were Justices Clarence Thomas and Antonin Scalia.
Thomas, writing for the two, said the court ``manufactures a rule
that employers are vicariously liable if supervisors create a
sexually hostile work environment, subject to an affirmative
defense that the court barely attempts to define.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas objected that the court's rule ``applies even if the
employer has a policy against sexual harassment, the employee knows
about the policy and the employee never informs anyone in a
position of authority about the supervisor's conduct.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday the high court made it much harder for students who
are sexually harassed by teachers to hold school districts
financially responsible. But that decision was based on a separate
federal law dealing with discrimination in education programs.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's rulings revived Faragher's lawsuit against Boca
Raton, Fla., and kept alive Ellerth's suit against Burlington.
</P>
<P>
   The decision in the Burlington case conceivably could aid Paula
Jones' effort to revive her sexual-harassment lawsuit against
President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Jones accused Clinton of propositioning her when he was
Arkansas governor and she was a state employee. A federal judge,
relying on a standard imposed by the appeals court with
jurisdiction over Arkansas, threw out the lawsuit and said
employees can collect damages only if their refusal to submit to
sexual demands results in on-the-job retaliation.In Mrs. Jones'
case, the judge ruled that she had not shown any adverse on-the-job
consequences.

IMMIGRATION AND POPULATION GROWTH VS. THE ENVIRONMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By HAROLD GILLIAM  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ President Clinton's recent speech on immigration
at Portland State University was an excellent policy statement, but
it raises some troubling questions that are almost universally
swept under the rug.
</P>
<P>
   He was quite right in praising the immigrants' contributions to
American society and in denouncing prejudice against people ``with
new accents.''
</P>
<P>
   It is possible, however, to have respect and compassion for
present immigrants and still raise questions about the consequences
of future immigration.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the ravings of some racist fanatics, immigration is not
a racial problem; it is a population problem. It is projected to be
a principal cause of U.S. population growth.
</P>
<P>
   Is it ``immigrant bashing'' or simply common foresight to ask
what would be required for a doubled or tripled or quadrupled
population? What about jobs, schools, parks, housing, air quality,
open space, farmland and food production, transportation and
infrastructure of all kinds?
</P>
<P>
   We need far more information about the carrying capacity of this
state and the U.S. _ the limits set by natural resources.
</P>
<P>
   In California, the most conspicuous resource in short supply is
water. In drought years, this state does not have enough available
water for the present population at current rates of use.
</P>
<P>
   Water conservation and recycling _ both urban and agricultural _
could make more water available, up to a point. But all possible
belt-tightening measures could not indefinitely accommodate a
continually growing population.
</P>
<P>
   How much water could be imported to California _ from the
Columbia River, from the Yukon, from the Mississippi, and at what
cost? What population could any such sources accommodate?
</P>
<P>
   The ocean offers an unlimited supply, but desalting sea water
and pumping it uphill would require colossal amounts of energy at a
time when fossil-fuel consumption must be diminished.
</P>
<P>
   Nuclear power has seemingly insuperable problems of safety and
radioactive waste disposal. Solar energy on a large scale would
require vast amounts of land to collect sunlight. How much of the
state would be covered by the collectors, and how much energy would
they supply?
</P>
<P>
   Questions like these must be answered not only about water but
about the limits of the other natural resources that are under
population pressure _ fertile soil, forests, wildlife, fisheries,
open space and the services furnished by ecosystems that are vital
to the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Population growth is not the only cause of resource depletion.
Possibly half or more of our water _ and other resources _ is
wasted by careless consumption.
</P>
<P>
   We need to learn how many people California could sustainably
support if we ran a tight ship, eliminating waste while maintaining
standards of living.
</P>
<P>
   Population, of course, is a global problem. There is an urgent
need to offer family-planning methods, education and economic aid
to developing countries in sufficient amounts to help them reduce
population growth and build prosperous, sustainable economies that
could diminish migrations.
</P>
<P>
   We have in this state some top-drawer research universities
capable of developing detailed pictures of California at various
future levels of population and consumption.
</P>
<P>
   Only with this kind of information can we have rational public
discussion of immigration and population growth. But there will be
no possibility of answers until we start asking the right
questions. Let's get them out from under that rug.

FINDING THE RIGHT FURNITURE FOR YOUR SUMMER PLACE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, June 28)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By FRANCES INGRAHAM  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Umbrella tables, while festive-looking, offer a
healthy alternative to the picnic table, which offers no protection
from the sun unless you have it placed under a shade tree.
</P>
<P>
   The variety of umbrella tables appears limited _ an umbrella
stuck through a hole in a table _ but some thought should go into
the materials before purchasing one.
</P>
<P>
   Furniture sets, including table, umbrella and four chairs, range
in price _ depending on material and craftsmanship _ from
approximately $199 to more than $1,000. With proper care, the
furniture should be able to withstand the summertime elements.
</P>
<P>
   ``Always keep the umbrella closed when not in use or
unattended,'' stressed Jennifer DiIanni, furniture manager for
A-Frame Pools in Latham, N.Y. ``They are the main reason for tables
tipping over in a high wind. If you are in a windy location, you
may want to get an umbrella with wind vents, so that a mild wind
can pass through it.''
</P>
<P>
   Umbrellas are made from vinyl mesh, which allows some light to
filter in but not rain, and acrylics, which last longer than canvas
and won't fade. An umbrella costs approximately $50 to $250 and up.
</P>
<P>
   Standard umbrella bases are filled with sand or stone and begin
at $30. More expensive bases, such as those made from steel,
wrought or cast iron, can cost up to about $200. The latter also
allows you to use the umbrella without the table, should you want
to place it by a chair for reading, or use it to shade plants.
</P>
<P>
   As for the furniture itself, wood is a natural choice for the
beauty in the grain and finish. But wood becomes dry when left out
in the sun and should be lubricated with linseed or other oils to
keep it from drying out and chipping, cracking, splitting or
warping.
</P>
<P>
   Real wicker and bamboo are attractive and practical for indoors.
But outdoors, they can warp, pull apart, peel or splinter.
</P>
<P>
   Tables with polyvinyl construction are relatively
maintenance-free, except for washing off any dirt or spills.
There's even polyvinyl-coated wicker and bamboo, or resinweave that
simulates wicker.
</P>
<P>
   Metal furniture is durable, but if left out it may eventually
start to rust and require a coat of primer and paint every few
years.
</P>
<P>
   Many tables come with a metal or polyvinyl frame or base and a
glass or stone top. The plus of a mesh metal top table is that
water goes through it rather than having to be sponged off.

FAMILY DISCOVERS THE DOS AND DONTS OF MAKING ICE CREAM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, June 28)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAUL GRONDAHL  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENFIELD, N.Y. _ Two years ago, Gary Dake and Jim Derway, the
flavor gurus behind Stewart's Ice Cream, thought they had devised a
killer combination for a new taste sensation.
</P>
<P>
   From toddlers to grandparents, who doesn't love Rice Krispie
Treats? Put gobs of that sweet, gooey, marshmallow confection in
ice cream and you've got a runaway hit, Dake and Derway figured.
</P>
<P>
   So, they worked up a formula at the sprawling Stewart's
production plant here on the outskirts of Saratoga Springs, both
loved the results, and the cartons rolled out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great flavor and customers loved it, but the Rice
Krispie Treats got so damn hard in the freezer that they were
damaging people's teeth,'' Dake said. After the company had to pay
some customers' dental bills, the flavor was yanked from the
Stewart's lineup.
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't the only flavor faux pas for the ice cream meisters
over the years. Some innovations never get off the drawing board.
</P>
<P>
   In their business, it helps to think like kids. This led to an
experiment with Skittles, the chewable candy with bursts of intense
fruit flavor. Once frozen, the Skittles turned into molar-cracking
pebbles and the flavor never went into production.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are challenges, but running an ice cream factory is as
much fun as you'd imagine it is,'' said Dake, 37, vice president of
manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
   Dake is the third generation of his family to run the dairy
product manufacturer founded in 1921 by Dake's grandfather and
great-uncle in Greenfield. It is still family-owned and privately
held. Dake's father, Bill Dake, is president and chief executive
and his father's wife, Susan Dake is an executive. About 20
relatives are involved with the board or as shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   There haven't been any cows grazing the Stewart's acreage since
the '20s. The company buys milk in bulk from about 50 different
dairy farmers in upstate New York.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, Percy and Charles V. Dake produced Dake's Delicious
Ice Cream, but the Dakes sold the business in the late 1920s and
lost the name. In 1945, the Dakes bought Stewart's Dairy and soon
began producing Stewart's Ice Cream.
</P>
<P>
   Derway, 40, production manager of the ice cream department,
worked his way up the chain of command after starting 17 years ago
as a fill-in on the ice cream line. He recalled his boyhood in
Hudson Falls, saving up money for a gorging at the ice cream
counter of Stewart's.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd eat so many make-your-own sundaes we made ourselves
sick,'' Derway said.
</P>
<P>
   The company recently celebrated the 50th anniversary of
make-your-own sundaes, an innovation of Philly Dake in 1948. During
a two-day, make-your-own sundae promotion June 6-7, 233,000 sundaes
were sold in Stewart's Shops at 50 cents apiece.
</P>
<P>
   At the start of the summer ice cream rush, when counter sales of
dip ice cream for cones and sundaes doubles at the 279 Stewart's
Shops, Duke and Derway recounted some of their hits and misses as
flavormeisters.
</P>
<P>
   They'll know soon enough whether flavors they formulated back in
February that will debut at stores this summer _ Pineapple
Upside-Down Cake, Berry Strawberry Sherbet, Adirondack Bear Claw,
Citrus Margarita, White Light and Black Raspberry Cheesecake _ will
get the thumbs up or thumbs down from customers.
</P>
<P>
   Dake and Derway won't take the also-rans personally. ``Jim and I
guess wrong sometimes,'' Dake said. ``A customer buying an ice
cream cone is a happy customer. It's a happy product. You can't eat
this stuff with a frown on your face.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't remind them of the cappuccino candy disaster, though. The
duo were excited about the new flavor and worked up a batch. ``The
problem was that the candies absorbed water and turned into liquid
blobs,'' Dake said. ``You can't just throw any candy into the ice
cream and expect it to work.''
</P>
<P>
   There are hidden legal landmines in names, too. A Stewart's
maintenance engineer tossed out a name for a new flavor at a staff
meeting. Everyone liked Java the Nut. That's what was printed on
the half-gallon cartons.
</P>
<P>
   Within a few weeks of the cartons hitting the stores, Dake got a
letter from attorneys representing LucasFilms and director George
Lucas. They claimed trademark infringement because the flavor was
too close to the name of the ``Star Wars'' character, Java The Hut.
</P>
<P>
   ``We exchanged letters and I finally decided we would rename the
flavor,'' Dake said. Newly printed cartons reveal the flavor has
been changed to Java Nut.
</P>
<P>
   Derway is proud of one of his brainstorms that succeeded
brilliantly. A candy maker shipped Stewart's cases of Pop Rocks
trying to entice them to stock them in their shops. Derway had a
plan for those bright specks of candy that hit saliva inside the
mouth and explode with a soda water's fizz. But his first attempts
at Pop Rocks ice cream fizzled. The candies shot their loads once
they hit the ice cream mixture.
</P>
<P>
   Derway tinkered a bit and discovered that if he encased the Pop
Rocks in a thin chocolate-flavored coating, the fizz would be
preserved. He got the candy maker to ship blue and red Pop Rocks,
and later added a cherry swirl to the ice cream.
</P>
<P>
   Voila! Fireworks flavor was born. It was tested at the counter
last summer in time for the Fourth of July and it was such a hit in
dips that this month Fireworks is coming out in half-gallon
cartons.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really looks like an explosion with the swirl and you get
that fizz, too. Kids love it,'' Derway said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The ice cream plant operates around-the-clock (two shifts of
production and one shift of equipment-cleaning each day) and churns
out about 2 1/2 million gallons each year. A deep freeze storage
area (minus 40 degrees F.) holds three weeks worth of inventory.
That's 40,000 gallons of bulk ice cream and 200,000 half-gallon
cartons.
</P>
<P>
   Ice cream is a pretty basic product with these base ingredients:
milk powder, liquid sugar, liquid corn syrup, sweet whey, imported
Dutch cocoa (for chocolate flavors).
</P>
<P>
   Color and flavor are added to the base ingredients and are
pumped into a 500-gallon tank and heated to 170 F. and held for 30
minutes for pasteurization. The mixture is then cooled and pumped
through a freezer system as air is injected into the mixture.
</P>
<P>
   Air is key to ice cream. ``Our ice cream is about 50 percent
air,'' Dake said. More expensive premium brands like Ben &AMP; Jerry's
or Haagen-Dazs use less air; cheaper supermarket brands use more.
The difference is obvious when you compare the weights of a
half-gallon of different ice creams in your hand at the store.
Without the pliability provided by air, you'd be left trying to
hack away at ice cream as dense as a block of ice.
</P>
<P>
   Just before it flows into waiting cartons, candy bits and any
special effects such as a swirl topping are added.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not all that complicated,'' Dake said.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart's Ice Cream is sold exclusively in its ubiquitous brown,
shingle-roofed shops, which stretch from the Adirondacks to the
Catskills with 10 stores in southern Vermont.

ACHILLE LAURO PLOTTER RECAST AS PROPONENT OF MIDEAST PEACE 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GAZA CITY _ He was once the face of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Mohammed ``Abbul'' Abbas _ the most wanted man in the world 13
years ago after masterminding the Achille Lauro hijacking _ is now
a middle-aged, overweight chain-smoker who holds court in the
offices of the Palestinian Liberation Front, the small organization
he leads here with the permission of Yassir Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   But the source of his notoriety has not changed. ``You Americans
never forget, do you?'' he asks. ``You always want to ask about the
man in the wheelchair.''
</P>
<P>
   That man was the elderly and frail American Leon Kling-hoffer,
who was shot in the head by Abbas's men and tossed from the cruise
ship into the Mediterranean Sea.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, we feel very sorry of all that happened on the ship,''
he continues. ``We know how hard and painful it is when someone is
killed who is not related to the conflict. We have seen it happen
to thousands. Millions more have been displaced from their homes,
and the world never apologized to us. We hope one day the world
hears our cries as loud as it heard Kling-hoffer's.''
</P>
<P>
   Abbas now says the Achille Lauro was a ``mistake.'' He claims
that his men had only intended to use the Italian luxury liner to
slip into Israel, not commandeer it. But, he adds, their cover was
blown when a crew member saw them cleaning their weapons.
</P>
<P>
   When asked why Kling-hoffer was killed, he replies: ``He created
troubles. He was handicapped but he was inciting and provoking the
other passengers. So the decision was made to kill him.''
</P>
<P>
   Abbas's presence in Gaza today is an anomaly. Despite his 30
years as guerrilla leader bent on destroying the state of Israel,
Abbas was permitted by the government of Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu to return from exile to the Palestinian-controlled area
this spring.
</P>
<P>
   And the United State has dropped its efforts to extradite Abbas
for his role in the murder of Kling-hoffer.
</P>
<P>
   How Abbas was allowed to enter Israel's borders, without
objections from the United States, offers a glimpse into the
wrenching compromises required to make peace in the Mideast. His
high profile in Gaza has infuriated the Kling-hoffer family and
prompted a petition to Israel's high court for his extradition.
Some critics feel it renders hollow Netanyahu's podium-pounding
tirades against terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   Abbas's return to a crowd of thousands of cheering Palestinians
on April 28 also shows how Thursday's hard-core terrorists can
become today's freedom fighters and politicians. It is a
transformation played out from Ireland to Algeria to Vietnam. And,
of course, it occurred in Israel's own struggle for independence,
when Jewish forces detonated bombs that killed civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Abbas is now 50 years old, the same age as the Jewish state that
he has worked most of his life to destroy.
</P>
<P>
   He says he was 13 days old in 1948 when his family fled Haifa
for a refugee camp in Lebanon. When the Palestine Liberation
Organization launched its armed struggle in 1964, Abbas became one
of its youngest recruits. In 1968, he was in North Vietnam fighting
alongside the Viet Cong against US forces and learning guerrilla
tactics. By 1970, he was putting those skills to work. He planned
an attack _ the first of its kind _ firing a Katyusha rocket into
Israel from Lebanon. It struck a school bus and killed 11 children.
</P>
<P>
   By the late 1970s, he was known in the Palestinian resistance as
a major military strategist who used unorthodox tactics. His men
rode hot air balloons and hang gliders to penetrate the border of
northern Israel. They raided Israeli beaches in rubber dinghies
loaded with shoulder-launched grenades and machine guns.
</P>
<P>
   But the incident that made him infamous was the 1985 hijacking
of the Achille Lauro, off Port Said, Egypt. Abbas was not on board,
but his men held some 400 passengers hostage. With the exception of
Kling-hoffer, the passengers were released after a two-day ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   Egypt then put Abbas and his men on a flight for Tunisia, where
the PLO was headquartered. But the United States dispatched Navy
fighters to force the flight down in Sicily, under Italian
jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
   Despite angry protests from the United States, Italy allowed him
to flee before a US warrant for piracy and kidnapping could be
served. Abbas disappeared, despite worldwide manhunts and a
$250,000 price on his head.
</P>
<P>
   Along with two other Palestinians, he was convicted in absentia
in an Italian court and sentenced to life in prison. But he never
spent a day behind bars and has lived in Lebanon and Iraq for most
of the last 13 years, assiduously avoiding US and Israeli security
services by donning disguises and moving constantly.
</P>
<P>
   ``When America wants you, the whole world is part of the hunt,''
he says.

MAD ABOUT HARRY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Family comes first for Harry Connick Jr., the father of two
young girls and husband of former Victoria's Secrets model Jill
Goodacre. When Connick is home, he guards his privacy and hopes the
phone won't ring.
</P>
<P>
   Fat chance.
</P>
<P>
   The phone has been ringing off the hook for Connick, who has two
successful careers happening at the same time. He's an in-demand
musician whose love of traditional jazz and funk has struck a chord
with millions. He's an in-demand actor whose career took off in the
blockbuster sci-fi film ``Independence Day'' and led to a starring
role in the recent ``Hope Floats,'' a romantic comedy with Sandra
Bullock.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't ask for anything more with the way things are
going. I really couldn't,'' says Connick.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, I've worked hard for it, but the fact that things have
materialized _ that's pretty much luck, you know,'' he adds. ``You
can work for it, but plenty of people work for what I have and
don't get it. So I think it's all about the luck.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, but you also create your own luck, right?
</P>
<P>
   That's been true of Connick. He's been loved and maligned
because of his matinee-idol good looks, but he has not rested on
his laurels. Even now, he's taking violin lessons to improve his
skill at writing string arrangements for his mostly piano-based
songs. As for movies, he's ``constantly'' reading scripts, up to
three, four, and five of them per week.
</P>
<P>
   ``My family always comes first, but I like to work, too,'' says
Connick, now 30.
</P>
<P>
   And he's not afraid to be his own toughest critic. Looking back,
he says the funk phase of his last few years (capped by the cosmic,
New Orleans-steeped ``Star Turtle'' album) was fun, but ultimately
he became bored by ``the lack of challenge musically.'' He also
comments harshly on string arrangements he wrote for his Christmas
album a few years ago, saying, ``I wouldn't hire that guy today.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the string stuff was just too obvious,'' says Connick,
who adds that even some of the arrangements on his recent jazz/pop
release, ``To See You,'' sound ``primitive to me now,'' though he
feels musically that ``they're the most complex thing I've done.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm learning more and more _ and I'm getting better at it,''
says Connick, a child prodigy whose father was the New Orleans
district attorney and whose mother was a judge. Connick became a
star at age 21 via the soundtrack to ``When Harry Met Sally,'' but
his quest for self-improvement has never left him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mess around on a lot of instruments, but I'm not really good
on that many of them,'' he says. ``I played bass for a long time,
but I don't know anyone who would hire me as a bass player. The
same with guitar, the same with a lot of the brass instruments.
Like, I probably play trumpet better than I play saxophone or
trombone. But I've always wanted to have a working knowledge of
these instruments because, since I'm the arranger, it's nice to
know what the instruments are capable of. That's why I've been
taking violin lessons. The more knowledge you have, the better.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know a lot of great composers who were instrumentalists,''
Connick continues. ``I would say they were all instrumentalists,
but you can sort of tell the ones that were piano players and the
ones that were string players. But I would rather that line be a
little bit blurred. The last thing you want to hear is strings that
sound like a piano player wrote them. So I just think it's
important to know how many instruments work, because they can do
things that the piano can't do, and vice versa. So over the years,
you just keep playing and playing and playing. And I play well
enough for what I need to do.''
</P>
<P>
   That's still not well enough for some critics, especially jazz
critics, who have taken Connick to task for not being a purist. But
Connick is not about to apologize. He loves traditional jazz and
big-band music (he expects that his next record will be big-band
oriented, though he's not saying for sure). But he also loves New
Orleans funk _ another medium that appealed to him as a youth and
found its way into his music.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you spread out and do something else, especially with
jazz critics, they don't want you back,'' he says. ``But I'm very
fortunate that members of the listening public haven't been
affected by any of that stuff. I just perform and do what I like to
do. I'm very proud of my musical efforts.''
</P>
<P>
   Connick, if truth be told, is not overly fazed by any negative
reviews. He credits his father (the district attorney) for
toughening him up on that score.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess growing up with politicians in the family, I was
around critics my whole life. For my dad, it just was never an
issue. He did what he thought was right and moved on. And that's
had an impact on me.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing that Connick is adamant about is that his involvement
with movies has not compromised his focus on music. He wrote the
songs for his latest album, ``To See You,'' while on the set of
``Hope Floats,'' and had plenty of time to do them.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing but time on a movie set,'' says Connick.
``You'll do a scene for an hour and then you've got six hours to
kill. I mean literally kill. So there's nothing to do but read a
book or do what you have to do otherwise.''
</P>
<P>
   As for his next film plans, Connick says, ``I haven't made any
decisions yet.''
</P>
<P>
   And what are his criteria for choosing? ``It's really the story
and how the character fits into the story,'' he notes. ``I've never
had a problem doing characters that are evil or funny, as long as
they fit into the story. Whether they're an action hero or a drug
dealer doesn't make too much difference at this point. Maybe it
will sometime in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``The character in `Hope Floats' was a great character and
everything worked out,'' he says, referring to his role as a
self-made architect who goes to the big city but returns to his
Texas hometown to be a handyman.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's so many factors involved'' in a film, Connick says.
``You have to think about who's directing it, who the other actors
are, which studio is doing it, when it's being filmed, and where
it's being filmed. If they sent me away to Siberia for four months,
I don't know if I could do that.''
</P>
<P>
   And then come these expectant words:
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if every other piece was in place, I just couldn't be
away from my family for that long.''
</P>

SCARLETT AND RHETT RETAIN THEIR AURA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RENEE GRAHAM  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nearly 60 years after its initial release, ``Gone with the
Wind'' is best viewed with a divided eye.
</P>
<P>
   Without question, it remains an epic, deservedly recognized as
one of the greatest films ever long before the American Film
Institute released its silly list last week. From the dreamy swell
of Max Steiner's score to Victor Fleming's (and an uncredited
George Cukor, among others) eye-grabbing direction to Sidney
Howard's smart, saucy dialogue, there isn't one half-step in this
multiple Academy Award-winning film, a cherished adaptation of
Margaret Mitchell's paperweight of a novel, which starred Clark
Gable, Vivien Leigh, Olivia de Havilland, Leslie Howard and Hattie
McDaniel.
</P>
<P>
   But for all the film's treasures -- and they are plentiful --
its portrayal of African-Americans as simple-minded,
forever-loyal-to-massa slaves are very disturbing. The film's first
image features slaves picking cotton, as a scrolling narrative
waxes nostalgic for the Old South and its days of ``cavaliers and
cotton fields,'' that time lost which is ``no more than a dream
remembered.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A dream remembered''? For whom? Certainly not for those whose
lives and families were torn asunder, who lived under constant
threat of the lash or worse. Though McDaniel, who became the first
African-American to win an Oscar (for best supporting actress),
provides the film's moral strength as Mammy, her charatcer is
neither troubled by her enslavement nor does she leave her former
owners, the O'Hara family, even after she is legally free to do so.
And poor Butterfly McQueen went to her grave trying to live down
Prissy's proclamation, ``I don't know nothin' 'bout birthin' no
babies.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard's script avoids the ``n-word,'' but blacks are referred
to as ``darkies'' and ``inferiors.'' Yes, the film was made in
1939, a less-than-enlighted time, and based on a book about the
antebellum South and the post-Civil War years, but these
considerations do not make its racially and historically
questionable moments any easier to disgest.
</P>
<P>
   These faults rightfully acknowledged, ``Gone with the Wind''
remains a classic. In this masterfully restored version, in
gorgeous Techicolor and enhanced digital sound, from the carnage of
Confederate casualties to the stunning burning of Atlanta, the
scenes leap off the screen.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike today's films, ``GWTW'' was never overwhelemed by its
effects. It's the performances that have the most resonance:
Gable's absurdly charming rogue, Rhett Butler; Leigh's scheming
Southern belle, Scarlett O'Hara; de Havilland's saintly Melaine
Hamilton Wilkes; and McDaniel's proud, outspoken Mammy. Only
Howard's wishy-washy Ashley Wilkes still seems somewhat miscast. It
isn't a bad performance, but he virtually disappears in the
presence of other cast members.
</P>
<P>
   While long hailed as one of the great love stories, anyone
really paying attention has to ask what love has to do with this.
After all, Rhett loves Scarlett; Scarlett loves Ashley, (but
mostly, herself); Ashley loves Melanie. The whole movie is a
vicious circle of misplaced passions, but never for a moment is it
anything less than gripping. It may well be the fastest-moving
3-hour-and-40-minute movie ever, and Gable's most famous line _
quite controversial at the time _ at the film's conclusion, still
has a sweetly nasty sting.
</P>
<P>
   These days too many undeserving films are called epics; ``Gone
with the Wind,'' which should only be shown on the big screen, all
but invented the term, and remains one of the few worthy of it.

ESPN FUNK IS A SLAM DUNK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HOWARD MANLY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   They are only 30-second blurs on ESPN, commercials to promote
professional women's basketball.
</P>
<P>
   The concept was to blend ``something cool'' with the WNBA, and
as Tom Clendenin, ESPN's advertising director, explained, ``what is
cooler than a '70s funk band?''
</P>
<P>
   Never know with these advertising types. Not that there is much
discrepancy over what real funk is. George Clinton, the granddaddy
of funk, concluded a long time ago that the Doobie Brothers were
cool, but ``can you imagine Doobie in your funk?''
</P>
<P>
   But give credit to Weiden &AMP; Kennedy, the New York advertising
agency responsible for much of ESPN's spots. They produced the
back-in-the-day funk for the series of commercials.
</P>
<P>
   The first thing the agency did was call Niles Rogers. As many
recall, Rogers was part of the '70s band Chic, which pumped out
hits like ``Freak Out'' and ``Good Times.''
</P>
<P>
   The latter song was sampled by the Sugar Hill Gang and
transformed into the first commercial rap song, ``Rapper's
Delight.'' Rogers is the real deal, even doing the score to Eddie
Murphy's film ``Coming to America.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogers and Tag Gross, his colleague at RTG Music Limited, a New
York music composition, production, and talent casting company, set
out to assemble a band to recreate the sound of the '70s with the
rhythms of the WNBA.
</P>
<P>
   They didn't look far.
</P>
<P>
   They found their lead singer on the New York club scene. His
name is Justice X. That's his real name, as Gross tells the story.
</P>
<P>
   ``I handed him the W-4 forms and asked him to spell his name and
he told me Justice X,'' Gross said. ``I asked him how he spelled
`X' and he told me `X.' I went `Wow. Is that your whole name?' He
told me no, that his full name is Justice De La X.''
</P>
<P>
   The lead guitarist is Gabriel Gordon. He has been around the
music scene for years, most recently touring with Natalie Merchant
on the Lilith Fair tour.
</P>
<P>
   On trumpet is Wayne du Maine, a classically trained musician who
performs in the orchestra pit for the Broadway play ``Titanic.'' Du
Maine graduated from Julliard and now conducts that school's
orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   Drummer Sterling Campbell also has been around for years, mostly
performing with rock bands, including recording with David Bowie on
his latest album.
</P>
<P>
   Bass player Jerry Barnes has recorded with Roberta Flack.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't take long for these guys to come together as a band
and produce a sound that exceeded even the lofty expectations of
Weiden &AMP; Kennedy's creative director, Stacy Wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of them really knew each other,'' Gross said. ``It was
one those deals where they either had heard about one another or
they had a friend who knew.''
</P>
<P>
   The group rehearsed for two weeks before the commercial shoot.
They produced 12 30-second spots in two days.
</P>
<P>
   Musicians are a leery lot.
</P>
<P>
   Gross said they didn't really know how big the commercials were
until they saw the breakfast wagon in front of the studio before
the first day of the shoot.
</P>
<P>
   Then there were the costumes, those orange-and-white get-ups
that resemble the colors of the WNBA ball, with scarves wrapped
around their necks. And, of course, the naturals, or the Afros, as
'70s wannabes call the hairdos.
</P>
<P>
   The spots were shot a bit rough to give viewers the impression
that they are peering into a reherasal. But the sound is
unmistakable.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's real honest funk,'' Gross said. ``They ran with it and
rocked.''

   Between camera changes, for instance, Gross said the band would
strike up some classic funk songs. ``I'm telling you, they were
getting off in rehearsals,'' Gross said.
</P>
<P>
   No telling what the future is for the WNB-Ays.
</P>
<P>
   Gross said the later spots have bass player Barnes doing a long
solo and storming off the set and Justice X screaming at him.
``Gimme back my scarf,'' Justice yells. The next spot shows Barnes
being replaced by a short Japanese guy, Kenji Hino.
</P>
<P>
   The plot line reunites the band with Barnes back on bass and
Hino on, of all things, congas.
</P>
<P>
   Gross wants the WNB-Ays to perform at halftime during the WNBA
playoffs. Maybe even cut an album.

 GAZA CITY: ... he says.

   Abbas surfaced for the first time in April 1996. He claimed to
have embraced the peace process and was allowed to enter Israel for
a meeting of the Palestinian National Council, where he voted in
favor of revoking those parts of the Palestine Liberation
Organization's charter that called for the destruction of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's conditional on Israel recognizing my national rights,''
he cautions. ``My presence here shows we are interested in peace.
But now we have the feeling peace is getting farther and farther
away. The growing distance means violence is nearby. If peace
fails, all options are open.''
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu, who promotes himself as a world expert on terrorism,
has stridently criticized PLO President Yasser Arafat and the
Palestinian Authority for failing to dismantle the ``infrastructure
of terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Netanyahu administration permitted Abbas to reenter
Israel again last month. Netanyahu's senior adviser, David Bar
Illan, tries to evade criticism by pointing out that it was the
more liberal Labor government of Shimon Peres that approved Abbas's
initial entry in 1996 for the Palestinian National Council meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Abbas and a cadre of aging guerrillas were allowed into Gaza at
the time to bolster the peace process. According to the Oslo
Accords, any Palestinian whose entry is approved by Israel will not
be prosecuted for crimes committed prior to the signing of the
agreement in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Abbas returned shortly after the council meeting to Iraq to
collect his wife and children. It is not clear under the agreement
that Israel was obligated to let him back to Gaza. Yet he returned
on April 28, crossing through the Israeli checkpoint on the border
of Egypt before entering into Palestinian-controlled Gaza. After a
five-hour delay at the border, the Netanyahu administration
approved entry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm as puzzled by it as anybody. It's very difficult to
rationalize,'' concedes Bar Illan. ``But we have to live by it. The
political process sometimes overrides the theory on terrorism. It
is quite difficult, admittedly.''
</P>
<P>
   Ron Tarassian, who leads a right-wing group, Our Jerusalem,
fumes that Abbas is sitting in Gaza. ``It's despicable that the
Israeli government let him in,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Tarassian, Rabbi Avi Weiss, an American right-wing activist, and
Dov Hikind, a New York assemblyman, have petitioned the Israeli
High Court demanding Abbas's arrest and extradition. The court
referred the case to a panel of three judges, a move that indicates
the petition is being taken seriously.
</P>
<P>
   But efforts to bring Abbas to justice have gone nowhere. Italy
has made no efforts to extradite him, and the US Justice Department
claims it has no grounds to seek his extradition because there is
no outstanding warrant against him. The American warrants were
dropped after his conviction in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Last August, the PLO settled a lawsuit with the Kling-hoffer
family and the tour operator of the hijacked luxury liner for an
undisclosed sum. Abbas says he would like to go to America to
apologize to the family _ an assertion that reflects the egotism
and need for approval that marble his comments.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a long time, America saw my name and thought of terrorism.
Do you think America still sees me that way?'' he asks.
</P>
<P>
   The Kling-hoffer family remains outraged that Abbas is free to
live in Gaza. Jay Fischer, a family lawyer, says: ``My clients are
deeply upset... Any force of law that can bring him to justice
should be carried out.''
</P>
<P>
   But Abbas's present role as a former militant who now supports
the peace process may be useful to Israel and to the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   In the current peacemaking terrain, his Palestinian Liberation
Front presents a secular and relatively moderate alternative to the
Islamic Resistance Movement Hamas whose military wing has carried
out a spate of suicide bombings in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Abbas criticizes Hamas these days, distinguishing between
guerrilla actions like his in which civilians were ``accidentally
hurt'' and those by Hamas which target civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Ariel Merari, who served for 22 years as the Israel Defense
Force's chief hostage negotiator, often struggled to defuse Abbas's
plots. ``He was an innovative terrorist, unique in his
accomplishments,'' concedes Merari.
</P>
<P>
   When asked how Israel can accept Abbas's present freedom,
Merari, who is now a professor of pyschology at Tel Aviv University
and a leading expert on terrorism, responds: ``You have to at some
point, in order to move forward, realize there are horrible
memories on both sides.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Palestinians, there is Deir Yassin and children killed in
the Intifadah,'' explains Merari, referring, respectively, to the
Arab village which was the site of the worst wartime attrocities by
Jewish forces during the 1948-1949 war and to the 1987 Palestinian
uprising.
</P>
<P>
   ``If both sides want to move on from their own painful memories,
at some point you have to draw a line ... But I should point out
that he is as close to that line as you can get.''

JUICE FIRM LOOKS TO STAY FRESH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After several years on Madison Avenue, Doug Levin fled to Maine
in the late 1980s, vowing never again to have anything to do with
the advertising business.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to get away from the hype,'' says Levin, whose resume
includes stints in the New York offices of ad agencies Doyle Dane &AMP;
Bernbach and Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi.
</P>
<P>
   A decade later, the 37-year-old Levin is chief executive of
Fresh Samantha Inc. of Saco, Maine, which since its founding in
1992 has looked to do for super premium fruit juice what Ben &AMP;
Jerry's Homemade Inc. has done for ice cream _ transform a
commodity into a cult product with a fanatical following.
</P>
<P>
   In its early days, Ben &AMP; Jerry's relied largely on guerrilla
marketing to make itself known _ guerrilla marketing often being a
euphemism for in-house advertising done on the cheap.
</P>
<P>
   Fresh Samantha has taken a similar approach.
</P>
<P>
   College kids in purple wigs hand out free samples with names
such as Raspberry Dream or Spirulina Fruit Blend or whatever
happens to be Fresh Samantha's oddball flavor of the month.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, delivery trucks in lurid hues serve as rolling
billboards for the brand.
</P>
<P>
   But now the privately owned company is at a crossroads. As it
moves into new markets such as New York, Baltimore, and Washington,
it is rethinking its promotional strategy.
</P>
<P>
   With 1998 revenues expected to reach $14.5 million, up from $7
million last year, Fresh Samantha recently hired a public relations
firm, Warner Public Relations of Manchester, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   It's on the lookout for a design firm to create new labels and
packaging. It might also tap an ad agency to do some work on a
project basis.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Fresh Samantha's 1998 marketing budget could hit the
``mid six figures,'' up from last year's $80,000, says Carin Warner
of Warner Public Relations.
</P>
<P>
   But Fresh Samantha faces a dilemma. In looking to reach new
customers, it could alienate its core audience of college kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the Generation Xer who's been our early adopter,'' Levin
said. ``Kids between 17 and 28, they want to go against the
mainstream. They want the underdog alternative, the kookie unlikely
product that isn't slammed into their heads by mainstream
advertising.''
</P>
<P>
   In Levin's view, Fresh Samantha is truly an alternative from
most juices consumers buy at a convenience store.
</P>
<P>
   Those juices tend to be heavily processed and pasteurized. Some
contain preservatives and sweeteners. As a result, a juice made
today can be sold next month and consumed a year from now.
</P>
<P>
   But there's a downside to processing and preservatives. The same
living organisms that can spoil are the ones that give a juice much
of its taste and health benefits, Levin claims.
</P>
<P>
   So Fresh Samantha minimizes the processing that neutralizes
these organisms. The result is a healthful, tasty juice, Levin
says, but one with only a 10-day shelf life and a high price.
</P>
<P>
   A single serving of Fresh Samantha can cost $2.50, at least a
dollar more than most pasteurized juices of about the same size.
</P>
<P>
   Given this focus on freshness, rushing juices from Fresh
Samantha's Maine plant to the supermarkets and cafes that sell it
is critical. Bad weather that slows delivery _ like the recent
heavy rainstorms _ is ``a disaster,'' Levin says.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're like Federal Express,'' he says of Fresh Samantha. ``For
us, it's all about overnight delivery.''
</P>
<P>
   Fresh Samantha's price has been almost as big a challenge as
getting juices to retail outlets in a hurry.
</P>
<P>
   In rural Maine, most folks won't pay $2.50 for a juice, even if
it's fresh squeezed and has a funky name like Mango Mama.
</P>
<P>
   In focus groups of ``suburban moms,'' reaction to Fresh Samantha
was mixed, Warner says; health enthusiasts were wowed and willing
to pay Fresh Samantha's premium price, but some in the group said
they would ``just as soon buy Tropicana.''
</P>
<P>
   But in ``urban college markets,'' it's been a completely
different story, Levin says.
</P>
<P>
   It's been students from Tufts, Harvard, and Boston College who
have fueled Fresh Samantha's explosive growth.
</P>
<P>
   As it prepares to move forward, Fresh Samantha must figure out
how to sustain its growth while retaining its cult status.
</P>
<P>
   It must figure out how to woo older consumers and consumers in
markets far removed from its Maine base without disenchanting its
core customer of college kids who seem to be leery of products
hyped by traditional advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is, `How do you advertise in a very unadvertising
way?''' Warner says. ``We have to figure out how to walk a very
fine line.''

   BOSTON _ The shade and shape of a bronze Buddha, Choo is
probably the darkest, but the equally deep tans of Louie the
Handicapper, Joe the Cop, Mike the Plumber and I'm Just Bucky make
it tough to tell where noses end and stogies begin.
</P>
<P>
   With racehorse-sounding nicknames and sweaty hides to match, the
``Sun Bums'' of Constitution Beach have unfolded their lounge
chairs every March for decades. They bask and baste almost every
sunny day until November, when, like so many Thanksgiving turkeys,
they're roasted to perfection.
</P>
<P>
   Retirees and divorcees all, these Sunshine Boys readily admit
theirs is a dangerous pastime, with barely a thing between them and
the hazards of ultra violet rays but sagging swim trunks, a thick
coating of coconut oil (SPF-0), a few faded tattoos and an
``I'm-this-old-and-I'm-still-here'' hubris only grandfathers and
war veterans can get away with.
</P>
<P>
   One of the ``bums,'' a trim 71-year-old Louie Cataldo (dubbed
Louie the Handicapper from a lifetime spent betting at Suffolk
Downs) was diagnosed with skin cancer a couple of years ago, but he
swears that just before he was to begin treatment, it cleared up on
its own. His doctor, he says, is furious with him for refusing to
abandon his 1970s-issue Playboy bunny swim trunks, (George
Hamilton, look out) his baby oil or his days in the rays with his
pals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's be up front: We are not good role models and we are not
proud of it,'' says Joe D'Tiga, aka Joe the Cop, a 59-year-old
retired Boston police officer, as he stood at the water's edge with
a half dozen of his lifelong beach buddies. ``I make sure these
young kids around here use sun protection. We don't want anybody to
be like us, except when it comes to having a good time.''
</P>
<P>
   And that they do. Carmen De Lucia, called Choo because he's
``waiting for my train to come in,'' says the loosely organized
group (``If there's sun, we come'') has had as many as 100
``members'' over the years -- mostly older men and women who soak
in the sun and each other's company from lunch until supper.
</P>
<P>
   Some come for exercise -- swimming and walking no matter the
temperature -- and some come to relive the romantic and adolescent
thrill of whiling the hours by the sea on a warm day, sun on their
faces, sand between their toes, wind and, well, jet fumes rippling
through their hair (the beach does face two of Logan's largest
runways).
</P>
<P>
   But they all come to &UR;  &LR; talk. As the tanned troupe settle onto
their beach blankets and lounge chairs, a sight conjuring spicy
Italian sausages nesting in buns, there is non-stop chit chat about
this and that.
</P>
<P>
   On this day, it starts with the President's pecadillos (``He's a
disgrace!''), diverts to local politics (``Ray Flynn lives in
Eastie now. Let's get him down here with us!''), touches briefly on
women (``We're no good with them. We're all divorced. That's why we
can spend so much time down here!'') and lands on the hottest topic
of all: the male potency pill.
</P>
<P>
   ``At our age, we talk about three things: Viagra, Viagra,
Viagra,'' deadpans Choo, 66, a gregarious retired construction
worker and self-appointed beach watchdog/master of ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Choo keeps tabs on the renovations under way on the
East Boston beach and bathhouse; makes sure little kids don't go
too far into the waves, and mingles among other beachgoers looking
for old friends and making new ones. In bikinis, preferably.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Bums vow to live their golden years literally. And they
look to the ``old timers'' as inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   They are the paling elders, many in their 80s, who also come to
the beach every day _ but sit under the awning at the bathhouse,
proving that old beach bums never die, they just sit in the shade
-- and fade.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's Tony the Bee Man, Tony the Carpenter, Tony the
Mailman, Tommy the Fire Chief and Andy Gumballs,'' says Choo, his
voice tinged with reverence as he points to the sitting seniors.
``That will be us someday. Our tans might fade away, but we never
will.''

JOHN FOGERTY KEEPS ON ROLLING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   John Fogerty is making up for lost time. Absent from the road
for too long because of disputes with his former record label,
Fogerty came back with a loud bang last year. He played hits from
his Creedence Clearwater Revival catalog that he had rarely done in
the last two decades. And he's back on the road this summer,
enjoying every minute of it once again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just playing for the people, having a great time,''
Fogerty says from his tour bus as it winds through upstate New
York. ``The simplest way to say it is that I live for the time I
can be performing. I also have my family with me, so I get to be
more normal than a lot of rock 'n' roll guys out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Fogerty may still be a mystery man to some folks, but for
others, he's the architect of some of the greatest classic rock on
the planet. His compositions include ``Born on the Bayou,'' ``Bad
Moon Rising,'' ``Proud Mary,'' ``Lodi,'' ``Green River,''
``Fortunate Son,'' and ``Who'll Stop the Rain.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever time I've got left, I'm going to do my darndest to
enjoy it and be reconnected with my own work,'' says Fogerty, after
playing Harborlights last year during a vaunted comeback tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would hope that touring would be just a normal part of my
musical life from now on. Years ago, when I first planned to be in
music, I thought I'd do all the things that other people do _ tour,
make records, be on TV, whatever,'' says Fogerty. ``But a lot of
the interruptions in my career were not of my own design. I really
paid a pretty big penalty for doing all the work and making some
other people really rich and famous.''
</P>
<P>
   Fogerty is still fighting with Fantasy Records, which owns the
publishing of the CCR songs he wrote after he signed a publishing
contract that ``kids would sign just to get a deal.'' For years, an
embittered Fogerty wouldn't perform the songs because he didn't
want to line Fantasy's pockets.
</P>
<P>
   Today, he says, ``If I sat around and worried about that stuff
all the time, I'd get really upset. But I've got a lot of positive
things to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The positives paid off last year. Fogerty, who now records for
Warner Bros., made a return album, ``Blue Moon Swamp,'' which won a
Grammy for best rock album, beating out entries from Aerosmith, the
Rolling Stones, and U2.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still pretty knocked out about the Grammy,'' he says. ``I
didn't dare hope to win the Grammy against all the people I was up
against. It's just a really nice validation.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Fogerty yearns for more respect from the general
audience. ``It's been tough to be away so long. A lot of people
either don't know about me or have forgotten,'' he says. ``And
also, because of the notoriety of having the band's name of
Creedence Clearwater Revival, you're somewhat seen as part of a
whole. I still have people walk up to me and go, `Well, are you on
a solo career now?' And I say, `That's a strange way to put it,
because I've been solo since the day I was born.'
</P>
<P>
   ``There's that whole confusion, but I have to prove myself.
That's kind of how I look at the tour. I'm quite happy to do that
because, frankly, I like the compeition. I feel I can hold my own
with anybody. It's fun for me to get up and show off.''
</P>
<P>
   Fogerty just released a live CD, ``Premonition,'' taken from a
performance at a Warner Brothers soundstage in Burbank, Calif.,
last winter. Much of it shows that he hasn't lost a step, though he
did just lose his drummer, Kenny Aronoff, to the Smashing Pumpkins.
Aronoff has been replaced by Michael Cartellone, who has worked
with the Damn Yankees and is a ``straightahead, edgy-type rock 'n'
roll drummer,'' says Fogerty.
</P>
<P>
   The song ``Premonition'' is also brand new and foreshadows an
album of original material Fogerty hopes to make in the next year.
``I just felt I really needed to write a new song for this project,
to show that I'm moving forward,'' he says of his current live
album. ``Otherwise, it's just going to feel like some old Vegas guy
trotting out his old trusty whatevers. And I don't feel that way at
all.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
---- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rickie Lee at Nectarfest: Rickie Lee Jones is in an up mood
these days. The progressive Beat-pop/trip-hop-and-more singer just
signed to Mercury Records, which will rerelease her quietly
bewitching, trip-hoppy ``Ghostyhead'' album this fall. ``They've
been courting me, and taking me around here and there,'' she says
of label management, led by music-biz legend Danny Goldberg.
</P>
<P>
   For the immediate future, however, Jones will perform solo at
the first annual Nectarfest Satrday at Nantucket's Tom Nevers Navy
Base with Bruce Cockburn, Jonatha Brooke, Patty Larkin, Livingston
Taylor, Ellis Paul, and others. She and most of these acts will
then island-hop on Sunday to play at Martha's Vineyard high school
athletic field. (Also part of the fest: Bob Weir, David Crosby &AMP;
CPR, Bo Diddley with Entrain, Jemima James, and others play
Saturday at the Vineyard site, then most of them switch to the
Nantucket site on Sunday.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't done many festivals, but I'm looking forward to
this,'' says Jones, adding, ``We won't harm anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Festivals are really fun,'' she continues. ``It's not like a
concert with just my name on the marquee. I really enjoy walking up
and playing the music and knowing that I don't have to carry sound
and lights for this.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Jones performed some West Coast dates of the
H.O.R.D.E. Festival, playing with a band she called Chain Austen (a
play on Jane Austen). ``I was doing some very alternative,
aggressive stuff,'' she says of that experience. ``People who
didn't know me liked it a lot. Kids came up to me and said, `What
was the name of your band again?'''
</P>
<P>
   For Nectarfest, though, Jones will do a retrospective of her
career, which started with the hit ``Chuck E.'s in Love'' in 1979.
And she'll also do some music that she hasn't recorded. ``I like
the idea that some songs are living songs, that you have to go
experience them rather than hear them on record.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones will then play at the Gibson Guitar Festival in Newport,
R.I. July 26, backed by a band for that occasion.

MOAKLEY LAMENTS A HOUSE DIVIDED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   America's House is dysfunctional. The Congress doesn't work
because it is broken apart by factionalism. Instead of Democrats
and Republicans working in tandem to make the system work, we have
the ideological equivalent of Hatfields vs. McCoys, with
vengefulness displacing patriotism.
</P>
<P>
   To Joe Moakley, the weathered South Boston Irishman who ran away
at 15 to fight in World War II and for more than a quarter-century
has been on station in the US House, the poisoning of the
congressional well coincided with the retirement (1986) of his old
pal, Tip O'Neill, as speaker.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly half a century, O'Neill's beaming countenance helped
curb partisan prejudices and steered colleagues toward calmer
waters when war, recession, or race threatened to tear apart the
institution.
</P>
<P>
   ``When O'Neill left, the fun went out of this business, and the
walls started to be built in that middle aisle,'' Moakley said this
week from his outpost in the Rules Committee he used to chair. Newt
Gingrich's reign as speaker has divided the House as never in his
experience, said Moakley. As proof he thumbed through a 51-page
report compiled by grumpy House Democrats: ``Politically motivated
Investigations by House Committees'' since 1995, Year One of Newt.
</P>
<P>
   It was Moakley who suggested to minority leader Dick Gephardt of
Missouri that staff assemble a list of all the taxpayer-financed
investigations launched by Gingrich's team in just 3 1/2 years. The
envelope, please:
</P>
<P>
   _Thirty-eight current ``politically motivated investigations.''
</P>
<P>
   _Seventeen more that have been shut down.
</P>
<P>
   _$17 million worth of legislative costs, and rising.
</P>
<P>
   Moakley fully endorses the report's claim of ``a clear pattern
of abuse'' by the GOP majority ``to harass political enemies,''
i.e. Democrats. Bear in mind, he insists, ``that this $17 million
doesn't count the $40-plus million spent so far by Kenneth Starr,''
the special counsel investigating Clinton. Starr's four-year probe
is approaching the $50 million price tag, with no end in sight.
</P>
<P>
   That $17 million price tag is for Congress alone and does not
include what other branches of the federal government must spend to
conduct what amounts to more than 50 separate House investigations.
And when you toss in the other special prosecutors and separate
investigations launched by the Republican-controlled Senate, it
seems likely that the price tag to the taxpayer of
Republican-inspired probes will approach or perhaps even surpass
$100 million by the time Clinton leaves office.
</P>
<P>
   Undoubtedly some of these investigations are legit. Maybe half,
maybe more. But, 55? And counting? ``This is why Congress is not
doing its work,'' said Moakley. ``It's so blatantly political.''
And the subpoenas showering down upon Democrats who work in the
White House or elsewhere in the government or in the unions,
nongovernmental groups or other organizations deemed hostile by
congressional Republicans are an expensive proposition to defend
against, said Moakley.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're trying to bankrupt the opposition and drain the
coffers of groups who might oppose Republican candidates,'' he
claimed. The issuance of subpoenas has degenerated into bitter and
at times farcical debate, though the Reform and Oversight
Committee, after months of disarray and staff firings, agreed 40-0
Tuesday to agree on subpoenas for the probe of whether the Chinese
government influenced Clinton administration policy with concealed
campaign contributions.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman, Representative Dan Burton of Indiana, had
denounced Clinton as ``a scumbag'' and became the poster boy for
bad manners and a symbol of mindless partisanship. ``I'm after
him,'' Burton has said. The sulfurous atmosphere of the House has
caused a virtual breakdown of communication among members.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt has called on Gingrich to remove himself from
congressional investigations for insulting Clinton and White House
staffers in a number of speeches. Gephardt pointed out that
Gingrich routinely challenges the patriotism and truthfulness of
his political enemies and has ``demeaned'' the office of speaker by
claiming that the Clinton administration operates, in Gingrich's
words, ``the most systematic, deliberate obstruction of justice,
coverup, and effort to avoid the truth we have ever seen in
America's history.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Gingrich himself was assessed a $300,000 penalty by his
own membership for his own ethical lapses, Democrats were less than
charitable in their response. But Gingrich doesn't need Democratic
votes on the House floor. He has an 11-seat margin of majority _ 12
after Tuesday's GOP victory in a New Mexico special election _ and
the Republicans' big superiority in fund-raising gives them a huge
advantage for the fall.
</P>
<P>
   So Newt keeps the scandal-pedal to the metal. ``No
administration in American history has lacked the moral authority
of Clinton-Gore,'' he told his rund-raising machine, GOPAC. ``We've
never seen this kind of complex, interlocking lawbreaking.'' Can
Newt have somehow missed the Nixon years?
</P>
<P>
   Fueled by $100 million worth of investigations and a news
industry that would rather sell salacious accusations than
patiently investigate the more sensational claims, the scandal
mills grind on, exceedingly fine.

ON-THE-GO CHEFS DISH IT OUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DEBBY MORSE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ If you pay a complete stranger to come into your
house to do the sweeping and scrubbing, how about paying a complete
stranger to come to your house to do the sauteing and simmering?
</P>
<P>
   As more and more busy people find themselves maxed out and
frazzled at the end of the working day, more and more personal
chefs are stepping up to the stove to get dinner on the table.
</P>
<P>
   For Jill Williams Gilmore, a financial adviser with three young
children, ``cooking is a necessary evil. It's too easy for a
working parent to open up a can.''
</P>
<P>
   So every couple of weeks, Rachel Stewart, owner of the Kitchen
Magician in San Anselmo, shows up with her ``pantry-in-a-car'' and
assembles five family-sized entrees and side dishes, leaves them
packaged and labeled in the refrigerator and provides an
instruction sheet.
</P>
<P>
   ``And you'd never know she'd been in the kitchen,'' Gilmore
says. ``It's nice to have restaurant-quality food in your home two
or three times a week, especially with kids as young as mine.''
</P>
<P>
   These aren't the live-in cooks of yesteryear. These are
entrepreneurial individuals with a passion for cooking and an urge
to be self-employed.
</P>
<P>
   The personal chefs of today visit the homes of their clients and
prepare either the meal of the day or as many as 10 meals at once.
They're usually out of the house before their clients get home.
</P>
<P>
   At dinner time, all the client has to do is choose an entree and
side dishes, follow the directions, and serve.
</P>
<P>
   This may involve simple reheating in the microwave oven, or
perhaps finishing a sauce by further reduction or popping frozen
garlic bread twists into the oven. Stewart tells of a fish dish she
seasoned and assembled and left uncooked for a client, who did the
job himself (and was thrilled with his new-found skills).
</P>
<P>
   Gilmore likes the fact that Stewart will suggest, but not
prepare, certain accompanying dishes. ``I do it myself,'' Gilmore
says. ``The kids have to realize I can actually do something.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart has been running her personal chef business for about 18
months and cooks for nine clients. In a single day, she can prepare
18 to 20 portions of perhaps five to seven snazzy entrees, plus
side dishes, for $300, food costs included.
</P>
<P>
   In her vast repertoire are elegant soups, curries, pastas,
vegetables and some treasured recipes from her mother, like chicken
sausage with yams and apples and a maple glaze.
</P>
<P>
   A popular dish is a puff-pastry-topped casserole of salmon
fillets layered with rice, fresh spinach, mushrooms and tarragon.
Then there's another favorite of smoked ham, chickpeas and chard.
``It depends on what's in season, what's at the farmers market,''
Stewart says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a lot of single clients,'' she says. ``They don't want
to go to restaurants, they want to eat at home. And they want to
eat better. People are very food-savvy in the (San Francisco) Bay
area, and there's an incredible wealth of ingredients.''
</P>
<P>
   What was once a luxury only the privileged could afford
increasingly is becoming a phenomenon of the working professional
class.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the upper crust continues to delight in the services
of personal chefs. Lori Regis and Amaryll Schwertner are the owners
of Fork in the Road, a San Francisco-based outfit that provides
upscale customized meals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I dare say that personal chef service at the level we provide
probably hasn't filtered a whole lot into the middle-class
market,'' Regis says.
</P>
<P>
   And what level might that be? For a recent meal for a wealthy
businessman, the menu consisted of caviar with puff pastry, a
chicken liver mousseline, fresh-picked arugula and home-made
croutons, Niman Schell rack of lamb with a sauce of lamb reduction
and grape must, creamy risotto, Romano beans with mint and cumin
garnish, cocoa and chocolate souffles, and cookies.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and wine. The dinner guest was the owner of Chalk Hill
winery, and the client himself is on the board of Kendall-Jackson
winery, so both labels were poured.
</P>
<P>
   ``A percentage of what we do is cooking, and a larger percentage
of it is protocol,'' Schwertner says.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, this was not an unusual dinner for the client _ he
just happened to have company that night, so Schwertner and Regis
merely prepared more servings.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Less opulent, but still elegant service might come from the
California Culinary Academy in San Francisco, where 10 percent to
15 percent of the alumni have worked as personal chefs, and
students frequently moonlight as personal chefs, according to Kim
Amatore, CCA marketing manager.
</P>
<P>
   Fees for service vary, but $20 to $30 per hour, plus food, is
par. Most prefer to keep their client list to a minimum _ their
days are filled with tongs and toques, couscous and coriander at
school, after all.
</P>
<P>
   With the level of sophistication academy-trained chefs provide,
though, aren't finicky children likely to turn up their noses at
dinner time? Many personal chefs are more than happy to cater to
the delicate palates of kids by making a meal the whole family can
enjoy.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart does an intensive food interview with prospective
clients to determine their tastes. ``I'll meet families with
children, and they say `the kids eat what we eat.' But the reality
is that they eat what the kids eat. So I'll make spaghetti, but
I'll make it more interesting for the adults with eggplant or
something.''
</P>
<P>
   Five news and business magazines, among them U.S. News &AMP; World
Report and Your Money magazine, recently named the personal chef
business one of the hottest home-based businesses for 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Riding that tiger is David MacKay, founder of the United States
Personal Chef Association in Albuquerque, N.M. The association,
established in 1991, boasts more than 1,500 members.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are more than an agency,'' MacKay says. ``We are a
professional organization. We provide cooking and business training
for our chefs, and we put chefs together with folks in the
community who want to hire them. We have audiotapes, videotapes,
correspondence courses.''
</P>
<P>
   And recipes. USPCA provides its members, half of whom are not
academy-trained, with 500 recipes designed to survive freezing and
reheating. Membership is $49 a year. The cost for the training,
plus the investment in kitchen equipment, runs between $1,000 and
$1,500, and MacKay says his personal chefs can make $40,000 to
$50,000 per year.

THREADS OF TIME 
Recollections 
By Peter Brook 
Counterpoint, 212 pp., illustrated, $25 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The British director Peter Brook is one of the great visionaries
of contemporary theater, a man who breathes life and passion into a
form that all too often seems deadened by crass commercialism and
utter banality. In his stage (and subsequent film) adaptation of
the Indian epic ``The Mahabharata,'' he created a sweeping canvas
for all the great human motivations _ loyalty and jealousy, love
and hate, constancy and revenge. But for all its epic scope, the
production drove home a simple truth: Life, at its richest and
fullest, is a mix of the sacred and the ordinary, a poor man's
communion shared in a bare yet blessed space.
</P>
<P>
   Brook's long career has dramatized this truth, and he has
written eloquently about his theatrical vision in such classics as
``The Shifting Point'' and ``The Empty Space.'' His new memoir,
``Threads of Time: Recollections,'' begins as a sort of
quasi-autobiography about how a young man who started in
conventional theater managed to tear down the fourth wall and
reinvent the form. But while the book offers fleeting glimpses of
theatrical luminaries including Glenda Jackson and Sir Laurence
Olivier, this is not your typical backstage tell-all. On the first
page, Brook admits an aversion to such gossipy tomes: ``I do not
feel a compulsion to tell the whole truth,'' he writes. ``I have no
respect at all for the school of biography that believes if every
social, historical, and psychological detail is added together, a
true portrait of a life appears.''
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, you have to respect this stance, but as a result
of his reticence, Brook ends up with two distinct stories rather
than an organic whole. His memories _ the titular threads of time _
form an incomplete autobiography that is frustrating at best, dull
at worst. But when he finally gets around to the creation of his
International Center for Theater Research, a one-of-a-kind dramatic
laboratory in Paris, another story unfolds; the writing sings with
exemplary passion.
</P>
<P>
   The child of Russian immigrants, Brook was born in England in
1925 and enjoyed a safe childhood behind the gates of a cozy
household. He fed his imagination as a youth, lapping up film and
theater, and went off to Oxford as a dutiful son. Through a
combination of determination and luck, he gained a quick entree
into the theater world, directing productions in the West End and
at Stratford-on-Avon as a young man. While he was emerging as the
enfant terrible of the British stage, he also began a spiritual
search that is never quite clearly illuminated.
</P>
<P>
   Brook also has a maddening habit of casting out throwaway lines,
casually referring to a childhood illness or an experience with
hallucinogenic drugs but then letting them hang, forgotten and
unexplained. He briefly mentions his romance with his wife,
Natasha, but never even identifies her surname, or much else about
her.
</P>
<P>
   But when he focuses on the International Center, Brook writes
with breathtaking honesty and passion. He describes an epiphany he
had one day when a pony mysteriously leaped out of a patch of
quicksand: He, too, was compelled to escape the traps of
traditional theater. He makes the dreary yet necessary task of
fund-raising sound like a mystical quest. He leads the reader,
along with his multicultural troupe of actors, on a journey that
takes them to villages in Africa and to urban sprawls in
California. ``It is how you enter a village that counts,'' he
writes, then goes on to describe simple yet sacred encounters in
his search to find a universal means of communication.Brook is at
his best here, as both a writer and director.
</P>
<P>
   ``Threads of Time'' is inspiring when Brook lets us glimpse the
place where the fabric of his personal values and his theatrical
vision come together. He doesn't entirely weave the two threads
together in this memoir, though, and that's just plain perplexing,
since his passion for theater as a healing force is a welcome tonic
in this age of numbingly antiseptic art. At the very least, he
offers a sliver of hope for anyone still willing to believe that
art matters. ``Theater,'' he writes, ``can penetrate into the
darkest zones of terror and despair for one reason only: to be able
to affirm, neither before nor after but at the very same moment,
that light is present in darkness.''

COMPUTERS _ THEY'RE IN THE ARMY NOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ED OFFLEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT LEWIS _ Harnessing the power of computers to the American
soldier, the Army is preparing to formally unveil the first combat
division in history built from the ground up around the microchip
revolution.
</P>
<P>
   After five years of planning and experimentation with
state-of-the art computer technology embedded in communications and
weapons systems, the 4th Infantry Division at Fort Hood, Texas,
will be certified as ready for deployment in 18 months, said Gen.
William Hartzog.
</P>
<P>
   As commander of the Training and Doctrine Command, Hartzog has
led the Army-wide program to field the new systems.
</P>
<P>
   Known as Force XXI, for the 21st century campaigns in which it
will fight, the new Army structure aims at increasing combat
effectiveness, maneuverability and decision making through computer
applications throughout the combat and support forces, Hartzog said
in an interview at Fort Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   Units will use state-of-the-art M1A2 Abrams tanks and M3 Bradley
infantry vehicles, but will require fewer per brigade. The division
will require only 15,000 troops, instead of the 18,000 now on its
roster.
</P>
<P>
   The heart of the division will be an array of computer networks
that provide commanders and soldiers with unparalleled knowledge of
the battlefield before and during combat.
</P>
<P>
   The Force XXI concept emerged after the end of the Cold War as
Army leaders realized that future threats facing the United States
would likely bear little resemblance to the massive entrenched
Soviet Army in Europe, which the U.S. Army had designed itself to
fight, Hartzog said.
</P>
<P>
   Severe pressure to shrink the size of the Army, combined with
new threats from terrorists and spreading weapons of mass
destruction, impelled the service to embrace the technology
revolution, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The 4th Infantry Division, which consists of three heavy
brigades that rely on tanks and armored infantry carriers, will be
smaller but much more lethal due to new information systems used by
the commanding general and front-line riflemen, he said. While
retaining its combat punch for fighting in a conventional war, the
division can also be tailored for emergencies requiring a smaller
commitment.
</P>
<P>
   In a major field test last year at the Army's National Training
Center in Southern California, a brigade from the Texas-based
division demonstrated how its digital computer power translated
into battlefield success, Hartzog said. Examples included:

   (BBOX)Surveillance: When an enemy force began invading the
unit's operational area, surveillance aircraft and, later, unmanned
aerial vehicles, tracked the formation and transmitted data showing
the location and route of advance, allowing the brigade to
immediately prepare for battle.
</P>
<P>
   _ Air strikes: Helicopters attached to the brigade capitalized
on the same sensors to conduct an attack on the enemy, destroying
its air defenses.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ground and air defense: Mobile systems such as Avenger
air-to-air missiles and the Javelin anti-tank weapon were found to
be increasingly lethal against the simulated enemy because their
units were able to deploy rapidly and accurately.
</P>
<P>
   _ Battle space dominance: Even though outnumbered, new
command-and-control systems enabled the digital brigade to
outmaneuver the enemy on an extended battlefield, particularly
because the unit's artillery had the technology to immediately
track and fire on targets.
</P>
<P>
   _ Logistics: In addition to maneuvering and fighting faster than
the enemy, computer technology also enabled the brigade to resupply
its combat units faster and more efficiently, allowing them to
return to the fight sooner.
</P>
<P>
   The current schedule is to equip and train the two heavy
divisions and the III Corps headquarters based at Fort Hood. The
1st Cavalry Division will be completed in the year 2003 and the
corps headquarters by 2005, Hartzog said.
</P>
<P>
   A parallel effort to add digital combat systems to the Army's
light divisions, particularly the 82nd Airborne and 101st Air
Assault Divisions, will proceed during the next decade, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging that the Army has historically been a very
conservative organization when it comes to radical restructuring or
introducing new technologies, Hartzog said the Force XXI program
has also aimed to accelerate the service's decision-making process,
particularly in terms of designing and procuring new weapons
systems.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line to the computer revolution is that the soldier
in combat will have the answer to three fundamental questions,
Hartzog said: ``Where am I? Where are my subordinates? Where is the
enemy?''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have that (information), you have something that has
never existed in the history of warfare,'' Hartzog said. ``We
intend to have the entire force ready by 2010,'' he said, referring
to the Army's mechanized and armor divisions.
</P>
<P>
   Hartzog, 56, has led the Army Training and Doctrine Command
since October 1994. He previously served as deputy commander of the
U.S. Atlantic Command and also commanded the 1st Infantry Division.
He is a combat veteran of Vietnam, where he served two tours.
</P>
<P>
   Hartzog was interviewed during a visit to the advanced ROTC
summer camp at Fort Lewis, where 4,000 cadets are undergoing field
training and leadership development this summer.

WEIR'S `PICNIC' RETAINS ITS POWER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RENEE GRAHAM  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Contrary to popular belief, Peter Weir's stunning ``Picnic at
Hanging Rock,'' was not based on a true story. There was no
Appleyard College, no unexplained disappearance of three Australian
schoolgirls and their teacher in 1900. But this film is no less
potent for being fiction.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the Joan Lindsay novel, Weir's 1975 adaptation is as
genteel as it is unsettling. Both surreal and terrifyingly
realistic, ``Picnic at Hanging Rock,'' is the story of a school
excursion gone horribly wrong. The girls of Appleyard College, an
``educational establishment for young ladies'' run by the severe
Mrs. Appleyard (Rachel Roberts), are allowed to spend Valentine's
Day at Hanging Rock, a series of ominous-looking cliffs in
Victoria.
</P>
<P>
   All of the girls, chaperoned by Miss MacCraw (Vivean Gray) and
Dianne de Poitiers (Helen Morse) are allowed on the trip, except
for Sara (Margaret Nelson). She is not only regularly chastised by
Mrs. Appleyard, but harbors a deep love for her fellow classmate,
Miranda (Anne-Louise Lambert).
</P>
<P>
   Once the girls reach Hanging Rock, four of them, led by Miranda,
set off to climb and explore the cliffs. They seem held in the
mountain's thrall, all except Edith (Christine Schuler), who senses
something awry. When her classmates continue their ascent, Edith
runs away, screaming. Soon, local authorities are notified of the
disappearance of the girls, as well as Miss MacCraw whom Edith
passed as she ran down Hanging Rock.
</P>
<P>
   What Edith witnesses at Hanging Rock is never articulated, and
therein lies the film's appeal. Unlike most films today which leave
nothing to the imagination, neither Weir nor screenwriter Cliff
Green were compelled to answer every question and solve every
riddle. Even when one of the girls is found, it only deepens the
mystery surrounding her still-lost classmates and teacher.
</P>
<P>
   Which isn't to say the tension is anything less than palpable.
The film is infused with such dread and foreboding, each moment, no
matter how seemingly insignificant, becomes laden with meaning,
from birds in flights to a once-reliable watch which suddenly
stops.
</P>
<P>
   Weir would go onto direct such mainstream hits as ``The Truman
Show,'' ``Dead Poets Society,'' ``Witness'' and ``The Year of
Living Dangerously.'' ``Picnic at Hanging Rock'' still stands as
one of his best.

`FATHER ROY' TAKES ON THE PENTAGON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. MARCUS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
``Father Roy: Inside the the School of Assassins'' 
On: Sunday at 8 p.m. on PBS 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   First things first: during the last few decades, the militaries
of El Salvador, Argentina, Chile, and several other Latin American
countries murdered, tortured and ``disappeared'' thousands of
innocent people.
</P>
<P>
   Far from denouncing these crimes, Washington too often condoned
them. When visiting soldiers trained at the US Army's School of the
Americas in the 1960s, 70s and 80s, human rights lessons seemed an
afterthought. The main goal was hunting down
(itals)comunistas.(unitals)
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Roy Bourgeois, a US naval officer in Vietnam who became
a Maryknoll priest, has seen Latin American armies trample on the
poor and powerless. Bourgeois gave up a quiet life of reflection to
work in a slum in Bolivia and, more recently, to set himself up as
a watchdog at the entrance to the School of the Americas, in Fort
Benning, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   He's a dedicated, engaging activist, and Susan Sarandon's
low-key narration of ``Father Roy: Inside the School of Assassins''
makes a persuasive case for getting the Pentagon out of the
business of training Latin Americans. The hour-long film, directed
by Robert Richter, notes that the school's graduates have included
reprehensible characters such as Panama's Manuel Antonio Noriega
and a Bolivian dictator.
</P>
<P>
   Bourgeois has a personal stake in this: two friends of his,
American nuns, were among those raped and killed by Salvadoran
officers in 1989. Several of the officers accused of the crime had
attended the School of the Americas.
</P>
<P>
   Bourgeois, who is now in jail for trespassing on Army property,
wants the school closed. He has been joined by several
Massachusetts politicians, including Representatives Joseph P.
Kennedy II, Joe Moakley and Martin T. Meehan.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to argue with someone like Bourgeois as he recounts
horrifying anecdotes with his Lousiana drawl. And yet there's
another side to the story, and it gets short shrift because of
Richter's understandable but unyielding point of view. There is an
argument, advanced by several officials in the Clinton
administration, that the school has finally been forced to reform.
These days, ironically, it is the only place that some cadets and
officers from south of the border learn that it is not permissable
to torture people simply because they are suspected of
collaborating with guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Father Roy'' lets a Pentagon official make such points, but
his comments are dropped in like pebbles against the current of a
stream. The film relies heavily on interviews with and sermons by
Bourgeois as well as clips of the 1989 massacre by the Salvadoran
officers.
</P>
<P>
   If the School of the Americas cannot shed its terrible
reputation, much of the fault lies with the US Army. Most
commanders still refuse to admit that the school tolerated human
rights abuses in the name of snuffing out Marxism. They insisit on
maintaining a ``wall of fame'' featuring photos of high-ranking
graduates (never mind that several have been tied to abuses and
drug corruption). And instead of reveling in the right of critics
to speak out, the army insists on belittling Bourgeois and calling
him _ of course _ a Communist.

`DOLITTLE' A PRESCRIPTION FOR PREACHING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
DR. DOLITTLE 
Directed by: Betty Thomas 
Screenplay by: Nat Mauldin, Larry Levin 
Starring: Eddie Murphy, Ossie Davis, Oliver Platt, Kristen Wilson,
Kyla Pratt, Raven-Symone, Richard Schiff, Peter Doyle, Jeffrey
Tambor 
Running time: 91 minutes 
Rated: PG-13 (crude humor and language) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Dr. Dolittle'' has lots of animals, but not enough script. It
isn't Eddie Murphy's updated doc, talking to the animals, that
causes the sense of shortfall here, but a lame screenplay that
smothers high spirits under a pall of uplift. The movie spends a
lot of time knocking itself out doing the ``Babe'' and ``Mr. Ed''
thing, making dogs, rats, guinea pigs, owls, monkeys, pigeons, and
even a handsome tiger (that melts your heart with the dignity it
brings to the otherwise undistinguished proceedings) appear to be
talking. It spends the rest of the time sending a heavy-handed
message of self-empowerment, starting with Murphy's doc, whose
ability to communicate with animals was squelched when he was a boy
and must be reignited if he to become whole.
</P>
<P>
   He's got to learn that it's OK to be himself and open himself to
the joys of interspecies dialogue. It's the first step in
encouraging his younger daughter to stop thinking she's weird and
learn to love herself. And the self-empowerment theme extends to
the clinic he runs with two other docs. There he must find the
courage to stand up to a takeover by a big medical conglomerate
that would make him and his partners rich, but result in staff
firings and cutbacks in patient care. He's got to resume talking to
the animals, in other words, to keep the clinic people-oriented.
</P>
<P>
   The film has a few points worth making about symbiosis and
community, as he cures the animals and they cure him, but it does
so in such pedestrian fashion that we're simply not entertained
much. Part of this has to do with the fact that most of the time
Murphy was acting against nothing, or perhaps a pie-plate or tennis
ball on a string, with the animals computerized in later. The lack
of spontaneity is inescapably apparent. So are Murphy's limited
acting range and director Betty Thomas' tendency to fall back on
stock gestures, the most annoying of which is the one I think of as
the ``Home Alone'' meets Edvard Munch scream, a lazy and hackneyed
device that's plugged in whenever generic fright is needed.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy's rubbery smile of untrustworthiness is employed rather
too often not to fall prey to the law of diminishing returns, too.
The San Francisco locales retain a freshness that largely eludes
the film, although not for lack of effort from Ossie Davis' father
figure, Kristen Wilson's warmly appealing embodiment of the
thankless neglected wife role, Richard Schiff's sidestepping of
cliche as Dolittle's sympathetic medical partner and Kyla Platt and
Raven-Simone as his daughters. But I thought we nailed the film's
big insight a long time ago with the parrot that sang ``I Gotta Be
Me'' in ``Broadway Danny Rose.''

A LOOK AT THE TV SEASON JUST PAST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Every four years, World Cup soccer brings us some of the worst
acting this side of Cinemax in the wee hours. If they wanted to,
many of the world's elite booters could moonlight as guest
lecturers at the John Stockton Academy of Dramatic Flops in Short
Pants.
</P>
<P>
   Stockton plays professional basketball when he's not falling to
the floor in a heap. He could learn plenty by watching
international soccer players. Upon the most incidental contact,
these strapping, durable athletes fall faster than the fortunes of
the U.S. side. They take dives even when the nearest opponent is in
the next time zone. They writhe and grimace on the grass until the
guy with the magic water _ from Lourdes, we presume _ administers a
splash, and then they're ready for Act II.
</P>
<P>
   It's all so they can induce a referee to make a ruling in their
favor and simultaneously catch a breather in a game that knows no
timeouts. Often, the referees take the bait. Either way, the viewer
gets a steady dose of overacting that makes one look at ``Meego''
in a more favorable light.
</P>
<P>
   OK. Maybe not.
</P>
<P>
   But it does make one appreciate the good stuff on TV. And even
fake wrestling looks good alongside the melodramatic flops and
drops of World Cup soccer.
</P>
<P>
   In that spirit, we take our annual look at the best of the TV
season just past, hoping that the the occasional kick in the pants
won't send the network executives sprawling.
</P>
<P>
   Best new fall series to be renewed:
</P>
<P>
   This one is a no-brainer, even though ``Ally McBeal,''
September's most inventive new star vehicle, was leaking a little
oil by May. It's an affliction common to shows produced by the
supremely gifted David E. Kelley, whose creative juices sometimes
boil over and gum up the works.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Kelley's clever treatment of the old love-triangle
scenario made Calista Flockhart a legitimate star and gave Fox the
most talked-about new show of the season. Perhaps the best thing
about ``Ally McBeal'' is how it evolved into a fine ensemble piece
that showcased not just Flockhart's remarkable acting ability _ her
expressive face alone deserves an Emmy _ but also the talents of
Peter MacNicol, Greg Germann, Lisa Nicole Carson and Courtney
Thorne-Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Best new midseason
</P>
<P>
   series to be renewed:
</P>
<P>
   The frighteningly articulate teenagers of The WB's ``Dawson's
Creek'' can be a little hard to take at times, but Kevin
Williamson's bittersweet memoir of growing up in North Carolina
wins points for style and presentation.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that, in the telling, North Carolina, where the show
is filmed, becomes Massachusetts for some inexplicable reason. The
four principal cast members _ James Van Der Beek, Katie Holmes,
Joshua Jackson and Michelle Williams _ are appealing and convincing
as teens awakening to new realities. Sure it's soapy, but it's not
Aaron Spelling.
</P>
<P>
   Best new series to be canceled:
</P>
<P>
   If anyone needs proof that network executives don't really mean
it when they say, ``We have great faith in this year's lineup,''
consider ``Nothing Sacred.''
</P>
<P>
   On the theory that they have to fill 22 hours of programming
each week with something other than a test pattern, the networks do
a fair amount of guessing despite all their demographic research
and hocus-pocus-focus groups. ABC deserves some credit for taking a
flier on ``Nothing Sacred,'' a series about a Catholic priest
trying to reconcile his own beliefs with the dogma of his religion,
but it also deserves to do penance for failing to support it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing Sacred'' started out in a difficult time slot on
Thursday nights, and then was assigned Saturdays, where shows go to
die.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing that Saturday episodes draw smaller audiences, ABC owed
it to the producers to give ``Nothing Sacred'' sufficient time to
build a following. Instead, it pre-empted the show countless times
and then pulled it from the schedule with five shows still to air.
Hardly a vote of confidence.
</P>
<P>
   The official network explanation is that low ratings caused the
demise of ``Nothing Sacred.'' But to expect overnight success in
today's multichannel universe is just plain stupid.
</P>
<P>
   Best example of
</P>
<P>
   bottom-line programming:
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't a Top 20 show, but ``Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman''
regularly won its Saturday night time slot and had a loyal
following of fans after six seasons. The problem for CBS was that
most of those fans fell into the over-50 demographic that
advertisers loathe.
</P>
<P>
   The conventional Madison Avenue wisdom _ we use the term loosely
_ is that people over 50 are not nearly as susceptible to an
advertiser's blandishments as, say, a 25-year-old. Thus, CBS
couldn't charge as much for commercials on ``Dr. Quinn'' as it
could on lower-rated shows that appeal to younger viewers.
</P>
<P>
   I was never a fan of ``Dr. Quinn,'' but I still find CBS's
decision to dump it monumentally offensive.
</P>
<P>
   Best first impression
</P>
<P>
   that didn't last:
</P>
<P>
   Among comedies, ``Veronica's Closet'' had the best-made pilot
episode of the fall. Crisply directed and well acted, it appeared
to be more than just a half-hour of filler in the cushy hammock
between ``Seinfeld'' and ``ER.'' But, while delivering huge ratings
to NBC, it never delivered the quality entertainment its pilot
promised. Instead, it played like so many other interchangeable TV
comedies: shrill, forced and only occasionally funny.
</P>
<P>
   Kirstie Alley's neurotic romance expert, Veronica Chase, is
especially annoying, proving that the vein mined for several
seasons by ``Caroline in the City'' has not been exhausted.
</P>
<P>
   Best miniseries:
</P>
<P>
   NBC pulled out all the stops with ``Merlin,'' a new take on the
Arthurian legend, and USA Network can rightly be proud of ``Moby
Dick,'' featuring Patrick Stewart as the troubled Capt. Ahab, but
scenes from A&AMP;E's bubbly and beguiling remake of ``Tom Jones'' are
as fresh in the mind today as they were on the screen in April.
</P>
<P>
   It was sheer pleasure to watch Max Beesley and Samantha Morton
take Tom Jones and Sophie Western through the English countryside
in Henry Fielding's comedy of errors and missteps. Every aspect of
the six-hour project _ acting, photography, costumes, script,
direction _ was at the top of its craft.
</P>
<P>
   Best midseason stink bomb:
</P>
<P>
   This one's a tie between ``Ask Harriet'' and ``The Closer.'' And
tying them together even further is this curiosity: Ed Asner had a
supporting role in both, and it's hard to tell which one made him
more uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's ``Ask Harriet'' debuted first, with the premise of a
sexist-pig sports columnist getting canned and returning to the
same newspaper as a female advice columnist. Anthony Tyler Quinn
was the guy in drag, and Asner was the newspaper's clueless owner
who found him/her attractive. On the wince scale, it was easily a
10.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Closer'' marked Tom Selleck's return to a regular series
since his days on ``Magnum, P.I.,'' but it was more a reminder that
staying away is sometimes the wiser course of action. Selleck
played an advertising executive who started up his own small agency
after being fired by a big one. Asner was the agency's seasoned,
all-knowing creative director.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad the show didn't have one.
</P>
<P>
   Best-promoted series finale
</P>
<P>
   If there's someone in this country who didn't know ``Seinfeld''
was ending its nine-season run in May, he may have a future as a
universal juror, untainted by exposure to the media. He also could
do well as a continuing guest on the talk-show circuit: ``Tomorrow,
on the next `Oprah,' the guy who was blissfully unaware of the
`Seinfeld' finale.''
</P>
<P>
   The obsessive way the media covered the event was really quite
embarrassing, and the runup to the series-ending episode probably
made it impossible for Jerry Seinfeld and Larry David to satisfy
such inflated expectations.
</P>
<P>
   NBC also deserves some blame for greedily stretching the thing
over two hours. ``Seinfeld'' was always at its sarcastic best in a
tightly produced half-hour. Its finale suffered from a serious case
of bloat.
</P>
<P>
   Best series finale:
</P>
<P>
   At one hour, the finale of ``The Larry Sanders Show'' was also a
tad too long, but it was everything the ``Seinfeld'' swan song
wasn't: sharp, satirical and scorching.
</P>
<P>
   Garry Shandling never won an Emmy for ``Larry Sanders,''
probably because its subject matter _ a behind-the-scenes look at a
not-so-fictitious talk show _ cut too close to Hollywood's version
of reality. But fans of the show will always remember it as a
comedy that knew what it was trying to say about human frailty and
insecurity.
</P>
<P>
   The finale was especially touching and funny at the same time.
Pretty much what you'd want when you're saying goodbye.

PEOPLE ARE GOING TO THE DOGS _ TO RELIEVE OFFICE STRESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CAROL SMITH  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Your boss getting on your nerves? Work driving you up a wall?
</P>
<P>
   Try petting a puppy.
</P>
<P>
   On several occasions, a Seattle Post-Intelligencer employee has
brought a batch of English cocker spaniel pups to work, and the
reaction has been both swift and amusing. It is a sight to see
normally hard-nosed reporters down on the floor making kissy-poo
and talking baby-talk to little dogs.
</P>
<P>
   ``You really see people's personalities come out,'' said Katy
Khakpour, P-I receptionist and occasional puppy-minder. ``Everyone
goes crazy when they see a dog in the office.''
</P>
<P>
   Using animals to help with work place stress is an idea that is
catching on. The Oregon Humane Society in Portland, for example, is
mounting a pilot ``Animals in the Workplace'' program with five
small companies.
</P>
<P>
   The response so far has been enthusiastic, said program manager
Virginia Dagg, whose first client was Cascade Direct, a small
Portland direct-mail business. ``Employees just went crazy _ they
loved it.''
</P>
<P>
   Although it is one of only a handful of humane societies that
appear to be doing it, Dagg has had calls from interested
organizations all over the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care where you work, I don't care if it's the most
wonderful job in the world, there's still a stress factor.''
</P>
<P>
   But studies have shown that being around animals can lower
people's blood pressure and otherwise reduce stress.
</P>
<P>
   The idea for pets in the workplace grew out of the success of
similar programs to bring animals to nursing homes, hospitals and
other settings for animal-assisted therapy.
</P>
<P>
   The animals in Dagg's program are not from the shelter, but are
already trained for animal-assisted therapy. They and their
handlers will typically have had about 25 hours of hands-on
coursework to make sure the animals are comfortable around people,
loving and interactive. Once the program is fully under way, Dagg
anticipates the animals will go to each workplace about once a
month.
</P>
<P>
   Other companies are letting animals come to work on a more
informal basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's gaining in popularity here and there,'' said Maureen
Fredrickson, vice president of the Renton-based Delta Society, a
national organization that trains service animals for people with
disabilities, as well as handlers and animals for animal-assisted
therapy programs. ``As more information gets out about how animals
reduce stress, and more companies are trying to alleviate stress,
more companies are considering it.''
</P>
<P>
   But companies that try it have to be careful to respect the
needs of employees who don't like or are allergic to animals, she
said. The animals should always be kept away from people who don't
want to be near them.
</P>
<P>
   But many people enjoy seeing other's pets, she said. ``We see

   Some will ``borrow'' an animal to go for a walk. ``It's real
interesting to watch the office dynamics. It makes people much more
approachable.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, any pet who comes to work must have ``appropriate
business skills,'' she said. They must be controllable and under
control at all times. They can't interrupt people, and must be
clean and well-groomed. The animals also have to behave
appropriately around other office pets.
</P>
<P>
   Delta, for example, has between five and 10 dogs, three or four
birds, two or three rabbits and assorted cats reporting to work
every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can't go hunting'' each other, she said. ``We've had one
or two swallowing incidents, luckily they were non-fatal.''
</P>
<P>
   The regular on-the-job pets tend to form their own office
families, she said. The dogs know not to bother the cats, and
vice-versa. Some of them even pal around together.
</P>
<P>
   The federal Americans With Disabilities Act, passed in 1994,
also has been a driving force in introducing more animals to the
workplace, Fredrickson said. ``Public places are experiencing
well-trained animals for the first time. People are seeing that the
animals don't bring in 4 million fleas or knock over the
merchandise, that animals can be well-behaved.''

   Louis Richmond, of Richmond Public Relations Inc. in downtown

Betty Ann uses Molly as part of her therapy practice in Fremont.
</P>
<P>
   ``She humanizes the workplace,'' said Louis Richmond, who
renegotiated his lease to accommodate the dog and even has her sit
in on the occasional board meeting. ``People pet her in the
elevator all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   And she draws attention on her walks through Seattle's city
streets, he said. ``What people do, more than anything, is they
smile,'' he said.

LANGE HAS WILY REVENGE IN `COUSIN BETTE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
COUSIN BETTE 
Directed by: Des McAnuff 
Screenplay by: Lynn Siefert &AMP; Susan Tarr (novel: Honore de Balzac) 
Starring: Jessica Lange, Elisabeth Shue, Bob Hoskins, Hugh Laurie,
Kelly Macdonald, Aden Young 
Running time: 108 minutes 
Rated: R (sexuality) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Cousin Bette'' is the film debut of stage director Des
McAnuff, and his inexperience behind the camera shows in his
tendency to overitalicize the excesses that Honore de Balzac wasn't
exactly loath to portray in red-blooded terms in his novel. In
short, McAnuff seems too eager to punch the material up, much in
the manner of many a so-called contemporary staging of this or that
classic. It undercuts a sly, steely, otherwise absorbingly
authoritative performance by Jessica Lange in the title role of an
embittered spinster, looking pasty but wiry under a startling black
hairdo. She is the classic poor relation who gets back at the
Parisian relatives who have callously and thoughtlessly demeaned
her for years.
</P>
<P>
   The film begins on a promisingly malicious note as Lange stands
alongside the deathbed of her rich sister (Geraldine Chaplin). When
the dying woman asks Bette to take care of her family, our
appetites are whetted by Lange's way of compressing her lips before
saying, in frighteningly controlled tones, ``I'll take care of them
all.'' When her brother-in-law offers her a job as housemaid
instead of proposing marriage, as she thought he would, she thinks
she might have found love anyway when she meets and aids an
impoverished Polish sculptor who lives in the garret adjoining hers
in the theater district. There, talented seamstress that she is,
she makes her living as a costumier.
</P>
<P>
   It's when Bette's last chance for love is whisked out from under
her by her spoiled niece that revenge enters the picture. It's fun
to watch her get even, although it must be said that the family
members, with their various weaknesses, make it easy for her.
Although quite capable of acting alone, Bette enlists the aid of
the star of the burlesque house that employs them both. Elisabeth
Shue provides a sense of fun with the unbridled vulgarity in which
she revels. Bob Hoskins is another plus as the rich mayor and
leading lecher. Although Adan Young has his moments as the sculptor
ruined by the soft life, talking more and more about art and
practicing it less and less, he turns too blubbery and nondescript
too soon.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, McAnuff seems not to have trusted Balzac's lusty
potboiler to simmer along on its own gleefully malicious energies.
He's good at playing the atmosphere of the theater against the
upheavals caused by the aristocrats' selfishness, but rather less
convincing at making them seem a portent of the revolution of 1848.
In his rush to register with contemporary audiences, McAnuff
abandons subtleties _ as Lange never does _ for crude captions.
``Cousin Bette'' is worth seeing for Lange's passion curdled into
malice, administered with a silken expertise that is nowhere to be
encountered in anything surrounding her. Against her, the others
seem vastly overmatched.

LEONARD'S TWISTING PLOT MAKES A `SIGHT' TO BE SEEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
OUT OF SIGHT 
Directed by: Steven Soderbergh 
Screenplay by: Scott Frank (novel: Elmore Leonard) 
Starring: George Clooney, Jennifer Lopez, Ving Rhames, Dennis
Farina, Steve Zahn, Don Cheadle, Isaiah Washington, Albert Brooks,
Catherine Keener, Nancy Allen, Keith Loneker 
Running time: 129 minutes 
Rated: R (language and some strong violence) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Hollywood gets Elmore Leonard's novels right, they offer
pleasures no other crime movies do. ``Out of Sight'' gets Elmore
Leonard right. It's ``Get Shorty'' without the film biz satire,
``Jackie Brown'' with more snap and a few more curveballs. It's
also the first movie in which George Clooney looks like a real
movie star, relaxed, on top of his game, having fun. It's easy to
believe that this is the movie that made him feel secure enough to
leave TV's ``ER,'' convinced that his roguish charm could indeed
translate onto the big screen. Unlike the scripts for his previous
movies, this one gives him a good character to play.
</P>
<P>
   Clooney is Jack Foley, a career bank robber who has spent half
his life in prison, is determined never to go back, and is equally
determined to score one more big heist and retire. The other half
of the equation is Jennifer Lopez's smart cop, much tougher than he
is. They meet under unusual circumstances. She happens to be
present during a prison break and winds up confined in the trunk of
a getaway car with Clooney. This is the scene that could make or
break the movie. Steven Soderbergh's deft direction turns it into a
successful launch and reminds us that the great thing about
Leonard's capers is their quirky unpredictability.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard's movies go places other movies wish they were clever
enough to have thought of, and ``Out of Sight'' is no exception as
Clooney's felon and Lopez's cop find themselves growing interested
in one another. They talk, are pleasantly surprised to find
themselves on the same wavelength, make us feel the presence of
sexual chemistry that's allowed to simmer through several plot
twists and finally moves forward in a hotel room in Detroit. There,
he returns to her the gun he used to make her surrender, and both
openly confront the risks they're taking by acting on their
attraction _ freedom in his case, career in hers.
</P>
<P>
   During the bedroom scene, they convince us they're sharing not
only sex, but intimacy. It's hot and it's sweet, and the fullest
realization of glamorous and slightly edgy screen romance out of
Hollywood this year. One reason their attraction works is that it's
given breathing space by the funny, surprising antics of the
surrounding lowlifes and the wary father of Lopez's character,
Dennis Farina's retired cop, who tenderly gives his daughter a
revolver for her birthday and chases off her married suitor
(Michael Keaton, in a funny unbilled cameo that makes him seem to
have drifted in from ``Jackie Brown''). Another ``Jackie Brown''
alum, Samuel L. Jackson, comes through in an unbilled grace note at
the end, giving the film that final lift of surprise you feared it
had run out of.
</P>
<P>
   The others comprise a terrific ensemble cast. Ving Rhames is
oak-solid as Clooney's prison buddy, Steve Zahn is a comic plus as
the stoned surfer who leads everybody to the last big caper, Don
Cheadle and Isaiah Washington more than hold up their end when it
comes to juggling violence and humor as a pair of prison
acquaintances who want in on the big score, and Albert Brooks is a
plus as a crooked broker who stupidly bragged about having $5
million in diamonds when he was doing time for insider trading. In
his stone-faced way, Brooks makes the white-collar criminal seem
more reprehensible than the professionals, not only Clooney's
gentleman thief, but the killers, including ex-NFL linebacker Keith
Loneker, who momentarily forgets the diamonds and starts emptying
the fridge of steaks.
</P>
<P>
   Watching how all the characters slide together, bounce off one
another, and carom back onto the same collision course is part of
the fun. Leonard claims he doesn't know how his novels are going to
turn out when he begins them, that he starts with characters and
lets them show him the way. ``Out of Sight'' certainly plays that
way, even during its intricate interplay of flashbacks that show us
how things converged. ``Out of Sight'' is a heads-up action
romance, filled with sassy wit, a beautifully gauged undertow of
poignance, brightly and playfully alive. It never goes awry,
although it's certainly aware of the many ways in which life does.

A MUSICIAN REACHES THE POINT OF NO RETURN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM SULLIVAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   From the outside, Caleb Sampson's life looked fine. The
45-year-old keyboardist-composer was continuing his work with the
Alloy Orchestra, the Boston trio whose specialty was scoring modern
soundtracks to silent films. He'd won accolades for his soundtrack
to Errol Morris's film ``Fast, Cheap and Out of Control'' and had
composed music for an upcoming 30-minute film by Morris, ``Stairway
to Heaven,'' for the BBC. Classically trained, Sampson had composed
music for MTV, VH1, HBO, PBS, Showtime, and ``Sesame Street.'' The
demand for his musical talents was so heavy, says Terry Donahue, a
partner in the Alloys, that the main problem was deciding which
offers not to accept. He had a happy marriage to Kathleen Hickey
and a 19-month-old son, Oliver.
</P>
<P>
   But Sampson, who grew up in Lewiston, Maine, and often sought
refuge in the great outdoors, had been suffering from a severe
sleep disorder. It started a couple of years ago and worsened last
month when the family bought and moved into an Inman Square
condominium. At best, he was getting four hours of sleep a night,
usually just one or two, sometimes none at all. It took its toll.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything was great in reality,'' says Donahue, ``but his
reality had changed so much. Every little fear became blown up to
the point of no return. All the fleeting negative thoughts just
stayed there.''
</P>
<P>
   Sampson hanged himself June 8 in the Cambridge, Mass. studio he
shared with Ken Winokur, his other partner in the Alloy Orchestra.
He had just come from a meeting with his psychiatrist, who had
suggested hospitalization for his deep depression. Sampson and his
wife had the same psychiatrist. Hickey says the doctor talked to
Sampson about suicide and Sampson said, ```No, I'm safe. I would
never do that to Kathy.' Those were his final words.'' Legally, the
doctor couldn't commit Samspon without his approval. Says Hickey:
``I talked to the doctor and he said: `Caleb knew what to say to
get out of the office.'''
</P>
<P>
   Winokur found the body. He recalls a feeling of ``shock, sadness
and a strong degree of disppointment how he left his wife and
child.'' There was no note.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an absolutely atrocious sleep disorder and general
depression,'' says Winokur. In Boston, there are ``the best doctors
in the best medical centers of the Western universe, and they
weren't able to pull him out of it. Nothing in his life merited any
kind of despair. His career and life were going well. We've tried
to rationalize this over and over again. But he just got sick.''
</P>
<P>
   Hickey first met Sampson eight years ago. Then, they lost touch
and had a chance meeting outside Boston's Tower Records a year and
ahalf later. ``It was magic,'' says Hickey. ``We thought it was
fate. He was the most vulnerable, fragile, but strong, gentle,
loving soul that I ever met. I'll never meet someone as unique,
gifted, and emotionally vulnerable. We were a tremendous gift to
each other. He brought the most joy and love to my life and I know
I brought the most joy and love to his life. We were
extraordinarily happy together.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were together almost five years,'' she adds. ``Part of him
always had this yearning and despair, this ache for something.
There were times where he was capable of having a darker experience
of the world. When we got together, we thought a wonderful
relationship and marriage would fix it; we thought `Fast, Cheap and
Out of Control' would fix it; we thought buying a house would fix
it. But Caleb had huge anxieties about having adult
responsibilities, and they competed with the feelings he had about
creativity.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a creative person with a risky career, who gave up some
of what he had saved (to buy the condo). He'd say, `How can I be a
musician and support a family?' I'd say, `Honey, you're one of the
most successful muscicians we know.' But the money was a symbol, it
represented stability. He was terrified of taking those risks and
having those responsibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Hickey says Sampson had been on a variety of anti-depressants
and sleep-aid medications. Nothing worked. ``That exacerbated it
and tortured him,'' she says. ``He couldn't get any relief. He felt
like an utter and complete failure. Everything except for me _ it
never was us _ became a source of deep anxiety and strees and the
sleep problem didn't help.''
</P>
<P>
   The bitter irony, of course, is that Hickey was right about
Sampson's career growth. The Alloy Orchestra, just one slice of his
creative life, had scored new music to ``Metropolis,'' ``The
Wind,'' ``Nosferatu,'' ``The Lost World, ``Sylvester,'' and
``Lonesome.'' They played at the Telluride Film Festival. Last
summer, they played Radio City Music Hall as ``Metropolis'' was
showed. Last autumn, they played at the Louvre, accompanying
``Lonesome.''
</P>
<P>
   Says Winokur: ``We traveled the world together and shared a lot
of weird food.''
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, in a Globe interview, Sampson explained their
immersion in the silent world. Initially, he said, ``none of us
were interested in silent films. Like us, hardly anyone has had an
exciting experience watching silent films until we came along.
People go, `Silent film? I don't know, sounds like going to
school.' It turns out to be this intensely engaging thing. We have
become ambassadors of spreading the faith, but not through any
great design.'' The idea was suggested by former Coolidge Corner
programmer David Kleiler.
</P>
<P>
   Employing Sampson's syntheziers and the other two's massive
percussion rigs (using everything from metal ducts, pipes, and
bedpans to conventional drum kits), the Alloys created a
topsy-turvy world of sound _ sometimes whimsical, sometimes
frightening, sometimes warm. For all their clamor and clatter, they
were not a dissonant outfit. They played a couple of First Nights
in Boston to excited crowds. Their audience spanned ``infants to
geriatrics,'' as Donahue puts it.
</P>
<P>
   Sampson ``had an absolute uncanny knack for spontaneously
creating melody,'' says Winokur. ``We could sit down and he could
roll 'em off his fingertips, one after another. He could do a
hundred projects a year.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He brought in a classic romantic sensibility,'' adds Donahue,
``that sentimentalist thing that really translated. It helped make
our audience as broad as it was. He was very easy to work with, his
palette was so broad. If we were working on a piece (Ken and I)
didn't think was working, he could throw it away and start fresh,
where most people would go `Hey, that's my song.' The chemistry was
kind of amazing, and we used each other's strengths really well,
covering up our weaknesses at the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   The Alloys' next project was _ and remains _ scoring the 1923
Eisenstein film ``Strike,'' about a failed workers' revolt. ``It's
very shadowy and gray,'' says Donahue. The group will announce a
new synthesizer player and composer in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   With Sampson's death, guitarist, composer, and arranger John
Kusiak also lost his partner. The two, who collaborated on ``Fast,
Cheap and Out of Control,'' had worked together over seven years
and done approximately 50 soundtracks. ``He was so naturally suited
to creating music for visual media,'' says Kusiak. ``It was
something that seemed to flow out him intuitively. I remember we
were doing a PBS documentary and he sat down and looked at a cue, a
minute long. We played it back once and he played along with the
picture. It was perfect. No changes. I was floored.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a great human being,'' Kusiak adds, ``someone who liked
to have a lot of fun. We'd work on projects and he'd find a putter,
a golf ball, and cup and set up a whole course in the studio. He
was the traditional Mainer _ frugal, quirky. He ate the same
breakfast every morning, a couple big bowls of Maypo. He would ride
his bike everywhere. He never seemed to need much in terms of
possessions.''
</P>
<P>
   Their score for Morris's ``Fast, Cheap and Out of Control'' was
praised by Roger Ebert as creating a ``haunting, otherworldly,
elegiac mood that makes all of the characters seem noble and a
little sad.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
---- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``He channeled everything, a lot of his emotional life, into his
music,'' says Hickey.
</P>
<P>
   But, of late, Donahue says, his sleep deprivation ``was the only
thing on his mind, the only thing he'd talk about. He was getting a
little sleep, but since they moved he hadn't gotten more than four
hours, at the most. He'd be getting up, surrounded by responsiblity
and pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   Sampson loved Maine, says Hickey, and would have lived there had
his career permitted. She called him ``a loner for much of his
life, with a huge network of friends.'' She says he felt bad about
having to take medication, and was vehement about not being
hospitalized. He'd been on a new anti-depressant for six weeks
before his death.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had talked about suicide,'' says Hickey, ``and he promised
he wouldn't do it. He felt hopeless. Everything was amplified to
such a degree. He was lucid enough to know it was happening. He'd
say `What is happening to me?' ... It frightened him that it was
getting out of control. It was new to him, that he had something
that couldn't be treated, that couldn't be fixed from love,
compassion, and patience, the things in life that usually givve one
hope or joy. He'd put his hand over his heart and say `I'm in so
much pain.' I'd say, `We'll try to get you through this and trust
in time it'll get better.' I think his mind was so completely
ravaged. He chose an option that brought him peace. ... The reality
was so different from how he perceived it. He was denying the
greatness of his life. As hard as it is to accept, he made a choice
that left him with the dignity he could handle. In some ways, I can
hold on to an image that he had found peace, that living with a
mind that was ravaged and out of control, he just wanted his mind
to be at rest.''

`DR. DOLITTLE' IS A GOOD PRESCRIPTION FOR THE 90S FAMILY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WALTER ADDIEGO  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Buried somewhere deep inside Eddie Murphy's ``Dr. Dolittle'' is
a nice little family movie about a successful, driven dad who
finally gets in touch with the warm and fuzzy things in life.
</P>
<P>
   He does, indeed, talk to the animals, which helps him become
human again and revives his strained relationship with his
wonderful wife and smart, charming kids.
</P>
<P>
   The talented Murphy is appealing here, performing with sincerity
and restraint _ a wise choice, since his co-stars are a menagerie
of wisecracking animals with voices provided by a whooping crop of
his comedian friends (Chris Rock, Norm Macdonald and Albert Brooks
among them). Forget about bleating and barking: These critters
sound like they've paid their dues on the nightclub circuit.
</P>
<P>
   Set in contemporary San Francisco in a world of corporate
takeovers and fancy utility vehicles, the picture bears almost no
relationship to Hugh Lofting's children's stories nor to the
charmless 1967 musical, ``Doctor Dolittle,'' with Rex Harrison.
Murphy, the producers, and director Betty Thomas (``Private
Parts'') clearly set out to make a movie appealing to today's
audiences, and that's where the problems begin.
</P>
<P>
   Families raised on in-your-face TV like ``Married ...With
Children'' and ``South Park'' may have a low tolerance for
cuteness. OK, I suppose you could name some movies, too, that fail
the good-taste test. So the filmmakers decided to add a little
mustard in the form of butt-sniffing, flatulence and poop jokes
that begin with the opening scene and never really let up.
</P>
<P>
   The movie definitely stresses the ``animal'' side of animals.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy plays Dr. John Dolittle, a physician who has it all: an
adorable family, a plush Pacific Heights condominium and a thriving
practice that he and his partners are preparing to sell to
corporate interests for big money.
</P>
<P>
   But the strain is showing: He's abrupt, a bit testy and always
in a rush. As a boy, John was able to talk to the family dog, but
his no-nonsense father (Ossie Davis) wouldn't allow him to nurture
the gift, so John's forgotten all about it.
</P>
<P>
   But after a minor car accident, John hears a tongue-lashing from
a stray dog. Word spreads through the animal underground about his
rediscovered powers, and soon he's being consulted by owls with
injured wings and horses with dimming vision. Also on hand are a
couple of smart-aleck rats and a suicidal tiger from a circus in
town.
</P>
<P>
   The animal effects _ combining real creatures with puppets and
computer enhancement _ are accomplished, and the zingers, insults
and riffs delivered by the furry cast wouldn't be out of place at
your local comedy pub.
</P>
<P>
   By treating animals, John rediscovers his zest for medicine, and
becomes a better dad and husband. Presumably, he also gets to sleep
with his wife (Kristen Wilson) again _ a running gag has animals
interrupting their sex life.
</P>
<P>
   There are subplots involving John's incarceration in a mental
hospital (not too funny), and various machinations by a greedy
medical partner (Oliver Platt).
</P>
<P>
   That's about it. The animals tear off some funny one-liners, and
there's a nice little money-isn't-everything lesson. On the other
hand, the bathroom humor and general air of testing the envelope
are persistent, and, with the salty language, likely to turn off
some parents. But let's accentuate the positive (and I wish other
filmmakers would take note): ``Dr. Dolittle'' clocks in at a cool,
crisp and blessed 85 minutes. This is movie bliss.

RUDY YORK'S MYSTERY RUN AT A HOME RUN RECORD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rudy York was a pretty good ballplayer, but no one has ever
offered a satisfactory explanation of why he up and swatted 18 home
runs in August 1937, or why he almost broke his own record when he
hit 17 in August 1943.
</P>
<P>
   Will they someday be saying the same thing about Sammy Sosa?
</P>
<P>
   One thing is certain. Sammy is getting a better reward at the
pay window for his month of June than the affable York did when he
took apart the American League for a month nearly 61 years ago.
Sammy checks in at $10 million per. Rudy probably wasn't even
making five figures in those innocent days of yore.
</P>
<P>
   The man Sosa is about to elbow aside for one of those quirky
baseball records occupies a niche in baseball history that makes
him a familiar name for the advanced fan and a who's-he? for the
casual observer. He knocked in 100 runs on six occasions and he had
30-plus homers four times, but it is reasonably safe to say that
the thing he is most remembered for is that blistering month of
August in 1937, when he had 18 home runs and 51 runs batted in.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and did I mention he was the first baseman on the 1946 Red
Sox?
</P>
<P>
   ``A hell of a player,'' recalls Johnny Pesky, who played against
York in 1942 before becoming his teammate in '46 following a trade
with the Tigers. ``We all respected his judgment. He never squawked
on a pitch. And if one of us had a question _ was the pitch too
high, too low, or whatever? _ we'd go to Rudy for an opinion.
`John,' he'd say, `I think it was all right.'''
</P>
<P>
   York played a season and change for the Sox. He had 17 homers
and 119 RBIs for the '46 pennant winners and he won Game 1 of the
World Series with a towering 10th-inning homer off Howie Pollett.
By that time, he was 33, and he must have been one of those guys
who got old fast. (Part of the York folklore is that he was a
fairly serious drinker.) The Sox shipped him to the White Sox early
in '47. ``We all felt bad when he left,'' Pesky says. ``He was a
good guy to have on the team. He used to accuse me of hitting with
a tennis racket. You miss guys like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Because he had a great deal of Indian blood, people often looked
at the Alabama native and assumed facts not in evidence, as Perry
Mason might say. Foremost among those assumptions: that he was an
``instinctive,'' as opposed to a cerebral, player.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Doerr laid that idea to rest on the occasion of York's
death from cancer in 1970. ``At first,'' Doerr explained, ``I
regarded Rudy as a man with a great bat _ power and strength. Later
I found it was a lot more than that. He studied pitchers, spotted
giveaways, was uncanny in outguessing the opposing batteries.''
</P>
<P>
   York moved on to the Philadelphia A's in '48, retiring after
playing in just 31 games with a .275 career average, 277 homers,
and 1,152 RBIs. He could tell the grandchildren that among his
other acomplishments, he led the American League in home runs (34),
RBIs (118), and slugging percentage (.527) in 1943.
</P>
<P>
   In 1937, Rudy York was a 23-year-old rookie utilityman for the
Tigers, a good team whose main problem in life was that the New
York Yankees existed. He played some third and he caught, and he
would later becopme a full-time first baseman, but the truth is he
was a born DH. When August began, he wasn't even in the lineup,
even though the Tigers were casting about for a catcher following
what would turn out to be the career-ending beaning of
player-manager Mickey Cochrane by New York's Bump Hadley. Hank
Greenberg would eventually move to left so York could play first,
but that was three years down the road.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is that when August arrived in 1937, York had been a
Tiger contributor (12 homers), but nothing more. There was a
doubleheader here in Fenway Aug. 1, and York's only appearance was
a pinch-hit role in the first game. He didn't play the following
day, either.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't even hit his first home run of the month until Aug. 6.
He hit another the next day, and he was on his way.
</P>
<P>
   These were different times, in every way. Though York was on a
major roll, there was little national attention until the last week
of the month. On Aug. 27, distinguished Globe baseball writer Mel
Webb doffed the old journalistic fedora in Rudy's direction: ``That
boy York of the Tigers is hitting in sensational fashion ... it is
doubtful whether the old `Babe' ever put in a more effective
stretch than has Mickey Cochrane's recalled catcher.''
</P>
<P>
   And speaking of The Babe, Mr. Ruth himself weighed in the
following day. ``That DiMaggio boy sure looks like a natural to
become the No. 1 hitter in the game, but you can't overlook that
young Tigers catcher, Rudy York,'' he declared.
</P>
<P>
   York had some good company on that Detroit team. Serious
baseball fans would easily recognize every member of the starting
team, as well as starting pitchers Tommy Bridges and Eldon Auker.
The No. 3 hitter was Hall of Famer Charley Gehringer, who was on
his way to leading the league with a .371 average. The cleanup man
was another Hall of Famer, Greenberg, en route to driving in _ hope
you're sitting down _ 183 runs. York was batting fifth during the
streak.
</P>
<P>
   He had four two-homer games, the third of which, on Aug. 30,
gave him 16 homers for the month. Only then did anyone mention that
he had a chance to eclipse Ruth's total of 17 in September 1927. No
one knew from ``SportsCenter'' in 1937.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers finished the month at home with a game against the
Washington Senators. Talk about a dramatic finish. York blasted a
pair of three-run homers in a 4-for-4 performance. He drove in
seven runs.
</P>
<P>
   Those 18 homers withstood subsequent challenges from, in
addition to himself, Greenberg, Ralph Kiner, and Mickey Mantle, who
all had 16-homer months; and from Willie Mays and Albert Belle, who
pounded out 17 in a month. Now he has been caught by Sammy Sosa,
and he is no longer a man apart.
</P>
<P>
   What got into Rudy York? Who knows? His only explanation: ``It
was sort of warm, like it is down in Georgia.''
</P>
<P>
   Rudy York wasn't a Hall of Famer, and it's reasonably safe to
say that Sammy Sosa isn't, either.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball. It is a source of endless mystery.

WARRANTOR SHOULD PUT THE SCREWS IN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, June 28 1998)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I bought some Andersen casement windows at Home Depot to
replace some old ones. I discovered screws missing from the arm
mechanism where it attaches to the frame. I can see the holes where
the screws should go, but I can't get to them because the stop
molding partially covers them. So I called Home Depot who referred
me to Brockway-Smith (the distributor) who referred me to Andersen.
Andersen said they would send me the screws but I would have to put
them in. Isn't that avoiding the warranty? Is there anything I can
do about it?
</P>
<P>
   BYRON ROSEMAN, Chelmsford, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. It isn't the cost of the screws but the principle, and the
avoiding of responsibility with the offer of a couple of screws.
It's like a physician who gives you a diagnosis and tells you to
make your own cure.
</P>
<P>
   Also, passing the buck to the consumer is not going to do much
for the reputation of Andersen, Brockway-Smith, and Home Depot.
</P>
<P>
   I rather doubt there is much you can do. You could lay the
``law'' down to Andersen, which has been known to come right out to
a person's house to make adjustments to windows. After all,
Andersen is the warrantor, and as such should do anything needed.
The smallness of your problem may be keeping Andersen from making a
house call, but it still isn't right. Maybe a polite letter from
your lawyer would move them. You could contact the attorney
general's office of consumer affairs, or file a costly suit. But in
the end, I suggest you bite the bullet, remove the stop trim, and
install the screws yourself.
</P>
<P>
   The handyman replaced the arm mechanism on one of his Andersen
windows (no warranty involved), and had to remove the stop trim to
get to the screws holding the old arm in place. And guess what? He
split the trim. But after installing the new arm, he glued the trim
and put it back; no one noticed.
</P>
<P>
   Such a window design is not good, and I think in some of the
newer casements the screws are more accessible. Just be careful
prying up that trim.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am boxing in a beam in my basement. How can I butt the
bottom part of the box against a round Lally column, which I do not
plan to box in?
</P>
<P>
   C.H., Billerica, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Try this: Cut the bottom board a little longer than the space
provided between column and the other end of the beam. Measure the
diameter of the column amd draw a half circle at the end of the
board, right in the middle. If you make the cut correctly, the half
circle will fit perfectly against the column. Then cut the board to
length so it will fit in the space provided. Do the same with the
bottom board on the other side of the column.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. A have a leak over my bedroom. The flat roof above the room
has roll roofing that is 20 years old. Is it time to re-roof?
</P>
<P>
   CRAIG SMITH, Auburn, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Yessir, time to re-roof, because that roll roofing normally
lasts maybe 10 to 15 years. You got your money's worth out of that
roll roofing. You could put on another roof of roll roofing, but
better would be a rubber roof. Pay particular attention to the
flashing between that flat roof and the vertical wall it butts
into; that is where most leaks appear.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. The gasket on my refrigerator is in good shape, but it has
folded over a bit in a small area when the door is closed. How can
I fix it?
</P>
<P>
   DAVID FRISIELLO, Billerica, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I don't think it is fixable; trying to adjust it so it won't
fold over would be difficult, and it is likely to fold again sooner
or later. But if that folded gasket is not leaking air, I see no
reason to fix it. To see if the gasket is leaking air, put a crisp
new dollar bill on the edge of the frame where the fold is, then
close the door. If you can move the bill up and down with the door
closed, or it pulls out easily, the gasket is, indeed, leaking air.
If you can't, it's tight.
</P>
<P>
   The only real fix in my opinion is a new gasket. You can buy
gaskets at appliance repair stores. Trouble is, parts for
appliances are notoriously expensive.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. How can I change the color of a children's plastic outdoor
slide? It is a hideous orange. I got it from a dump, but everything
is fine except for the color. Ugh.
</P>
<P>
   MOLLY FAIRCHILD, Wellesley, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Get another one at the dump or live with it, the price was
certainly right. If the plastic is PVC, it can be painted, but the
finish must be roughened before painting, and a rough surface would
slow the kids down to a walk. Painting it would be folly, mainly
because any paint would not stand up to the friction of little
butts sliding down, and any paint, in addition to roughening of the
surface, would slow the kids down too much. There's nothing quite
so frustrating as being stuck in the middle of a slide.
</P>
<P>
   If the slide is fiberglass painting it is easier, but the finish
must be roughened, and all the caveats that apply to PVC also apply
to fibgerlass.
</P>

RETIREMENT INVESTOR IS ON TRACK WITH 401(K) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, June 28 1998)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I am 44 and would like to retire at age 62 with an income of
about $50,000 a year. We now have $157,000 in a 401(k) plan, with
$17,000 of it in a 5.95 percent guaranteed income fund, $56,000 in
Fidelity Magellan fund, $59,000 in a Standard and Poor's index 500
fund, and $25,000 in Warburg Pincus Emerging Growth fund. Annual
contributions, including my employer's match, will be $11,000 a
year. Other investment options within the 401(k) are Warburg Pincus
International Equities and Fidelity Advisor Balanced funds. Our
only debt is a $148,000 mortgage, on which we have been making $400
monthly prepayments and expect to pay it off in about 10 years. Are
we better off continuing with that, or should we be investing the
extra money? We have two children who will be going to college in
the next few years. Some of the money needed will come from my
wife, who will return to work. Should we contribute less to the
401(k), or make lower prepayments of the mortgage to help fund the
college expenses?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &UR; K.G. &LR; ,  &UR; Vancouver, Wash &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. My suggestion is to keep plugging away at the 401(k)
contributions at the current rate.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, your employer's contributions may come in the
form of a match of your own, so that every dollar you divert may
cost you more than a dollar in eventual savings.
</P>
<P>
   More important, you seem to be pretty well on track to reach
your retirement goal, but a reduction of payments might leave you
falling short.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the math: If you achieve average annual total returns of
10 percent form the retirement portfolio, with contributions at the
current level, after 18 years the pool would be $1,397,608. You
might expect such a sum, invested in retirement to produce an
income stream of 6.5 percent, to bring you $90,844. This sounds
great, until you begin thinking of inflation. If inflation runs at
a 3 percent average over the next 18 years, that $90,84 would have
the buying power of $53,361 in today's dollars; if inflation is 4
percent, the value in today's dollars would be $44,843. In other
words, you're in the ballpark, but achieving your goal is far from
certain, and reduction of contributions would probably make it
fairly likely you would fall short.
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly, my suggestion would be to stop prepayments of the
mortgage right now, putting the money instead into college savings,
hoping that with this head start you can meet the college expenses
that come up during the next six or eight years and then, upon the
final graduation, turn once again to the mortgage prepayments --
this would still give you a decade before retirement, which would
be plenty of time to retire the mortgage at least by the time
you're 62.
</P>
<P>
   Even though I'm not enthusiastic about the current market, I'm
even less enthusiastic about that $17,000, or a little less than 11
percent of the 401(k) portfolio, that's in the fixed-income fund. I
suggest you grit your teeth and move it into the Warburg
International Equities fund, which will broaden the diversification
of the portfolio, and which over the course of some 18 years should
give you a great deal better performance than the fixed- income
fund.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am 70 years old and my wife is 60. Between us we draw
$1,728 from Social Security. We have $65,000 in a savings account
and IRAs totaling $320,000, of which $210,000 is in Pegasus Growth
and Value fund and $110,000 is in Pegasus Mid Cap Opportunity fund.
Our condo here is worth $140,000 and is owned free end clear, as is
a $40,000 home we own in Florida. To live in comfort, we need an
income of $3,500 to $3,800 a month. Do you have any suggestions?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &UR; C.M. &LR; ,  &UR; Waterford, Mich. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes _ I think you should shift a great deal of the IRA money
into fixed-income holdings, designing the portfolio so that the
yields on your investments provide you with your desired income
stream, rather than relying on the vagaries of the stock market to
support you.
</P>
<P>
   Let's suppose you decide you can live on a median figure of
$3,650 a month. After Social Security, this would leave you with a
requirement of $1,922 a month from your investments. If the $65,000
that's now in savings were diverted to a CD or a money market fund
(or a combination of the two, so designed as to give you the best
rates plus whatever liquidity you feel you needs) this would bring
in about $300 of the required monthly money. I suggest you then
move $300,000 of the IRA money into a fixed-income portfolio. Since
Pegasus has a limited menu of fixed-income funds, you might look to
another fund family for this.
</P>
<P>
   My choice, based on low expenses and a disciplined approach to
investment policies, would be Vanguard, where I would suggest a
portfolio evenly divided between its Short-Term Corporate Bond, its
GNMA, and its High-Yield Corporate Bond funds. You might expect
such a portfolio to produce an average yield of 6.5 percent, which
would meet the remainder of your ongoing cash needs. The upshot of
these changes would be that you would have sharply reduced
stock-market risk, and still retain a token $20,000 in the two
Pegasus stock funds untouched, slowly building a fund which should
give you a little protection against the effects of future
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   I think that reduction of risk the most critical thing here --
more important than building a fund to hedge you against inflation.
Counting on stock-market gains to fund living expenses can be a
dangerous business. Suppose that you began withdrawing $1,622 a
month from the Pegasus funds, and that at the time you began the
market went into a tailspin, losing value at a rate of 10 percent
annually for two years.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of that two- year period your $320,000 in principal
would have declined to $223,875 -- a level at which you would have
to stretch hard to meet your needs. The more conservative path
should fill your financial needs, afford you less worry, and over
the long haul should generate an accumulation, rather than
invasion, of your principal.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am 1 55-year-old woman who plans to work full-time for
another seven years, and perhaps thereafter as necessary. With the
current market instability I sold all my blue chip stocks, placing
the $90,000 proceeds in a money market fund. I also own $30,000 in
mutual funds, invested in Fidelity Puritan and Oakmark funds.
Finally, I am contributing $300 a month to an all-stock 401(k)
investment. Where do you think the cash in the money market fund
should be placed with my somewhat short time horizon?
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &UR; J.L. &LR; ,  &UR; Vista, Calif. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, the classical suggestion for an intermediate-time
investment such as this is a balanced fund, such as Fidelity
Puritan which you already own. But I suspect that since you have
just bailed out of equities, so you're not likely to be
enthusiastic about that. So why not build a portfolio such as I
have suggested for C.M., in the letter above. You might reasonably
expect this to produce a yield in the neighborhood of 1 percentage
point to one and a half percentage points better than the money
markets, and while bond funds are far from isolated from market
sways, over the course of time good fixed-income funds tend to
balance whatever losses they sustain with similar gains, ultimately
leaving the owner with the yield. One advantage of such an
investment is that you would already have a substantial income
stream in place by the time you retire. At a 6.5 percent average
annual growth rate, that pool would grow to $139,858 in seven
years, and at that point might be counted on to produce a $9,090
annual income stream.
</P>
<P>
   To give you a fuller view of your likely financial picture in
retirement, if your 401(k) is funded at the current level, and if
both that account and your mutual funds grew at an average annual
rate of 8 percent during the next seven years (no, I am not
optimistic about stocks for the intermediate term) that pool would
be worth $84,712 by the time of your expected retirement date.
(This would, however, require that you used other funds to pay any
tax liabilities which the mutual funds generated during that
accumulation phase.)

CELTICS PARTNERSHIP INVESTORS HEAD DOWN TO THE BUZZER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE BAILEY AND STEVEN SYRE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rick Pitino would call a timeout to regroup if his Boston
Celtics were under this much pressure.
</P>
<P>
   But it is the team's publicly traded partnership units that are
under the gun, falling sharply on relatively heavy volume over the
past two weeks. The issue: a plan that would split the Celtics
master limited partnership into two new entities.
</P>
<P>
   Unit holders can swap for an interest in either of the new
partnerships and their level of ownership will remain unchanged,
though each of the investment vehicles has distinct advantages and
problems.
</P>
<P>
   But confusion over the complicated reorganization plan and
questions about the way it has been advanced are prompting some
investors to simply sell instead of choosing between one of the two
new ownership vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Selling pressure has been building as the June 30 deadline to
choose one of the two partnerships approaches. Celtics units,
priced at 16 3/4 Thursday, have slumped nearly 20 percent in the
last four weeks, and trading volume is running at about 10 times
normal levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems that there is the aura of impropriety, although that
may not be the actual case,'' said Sheryl Marshall, a broker at
Donaldson, Lufkin, Jenrette who has bought Celtics units for her
customers.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall and other brokers complain that the reorganization is
taking place without any independent appraisal or ``fairness''
opinion from outside experts, despite potential conflicts of
interest between public unit holders and the Celtics general
partner, among others. The potential conflict is cited in public
documents describing the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Celtics officials said they did not obtain a fairness opinion
because the reorganization will have no impact on the ownership
interest of unit holders. Officials also said professional
assurances could have cost several million dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was structured to make it as equitable as possible, so
everyone maintained their portion of the business,'' said chief
financial officer Richard Pond. ``Proportionately, no one is going
to be in any different position on July 1 than they were on June
30.''
</P>
<P>
   An earlier reorganization plan created by Celtics chairman Paul
Gaston, which never made it to the board for a vote, probably would
have caused more controversy. That plan, detailed in securities
documents, would have substantially reduced team ownership by
Gaston and his affiliates in exchange for other investments. The
initial plan was scrapped after financial advisers estimated the
team's value at $140 million to $160 million.
</P>
<P>
   The idea: Make sure everyone ended up with the same value,
dollar for dollar, but rearrange the actual assets. Besides the
basketball team, the Celtics partnership holds nearly $100 million
in cash and securities.
</P>
<P>
   Gaston and his affiliates currently own about 50.1 percent of
the Celtics partnership. The initial plan would have reduced the
investment in the team to about 20 percent through the use of two
new, related partnerships. In return for the reduced team
ownership, the Gaston group would have gotten other investments of
comparable value.
</P>
<P>
   The catch: placing a value on the team. An investment advisory
firm, Houlihan Lokey Howard &AMP; Zukin, was hired to assess the entire
deal and, among other duties, come up with the preliminary estimate
of the team's value.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics said the investment firm's ``draft presentation''
was not a factor in the decision to drop Gaston's plan. But the
partnership later held ``informal consultations'' with what was
then known as Morgan Stanley &AMP; Co., the large investment firm once
associated with former Celtics president Stephen Schram.
</P>
<P>
   Celtics executives said in documents that they decided it was
too hard to obtain a reliable appraisal of the team's value for the
plan to work.
</P>
<P>
   But the documents also said Houlihan Lokey balked when the
Celtics asked the investment firm to back up their public summary
of events in writing with the US Securities and Exchange
Commission. Executives at Houlihan Lokey did not return calls
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics are being forced to change their ownership structure
because a special tax status extended to a small group of master
limited partnerships is expiring. The Celtics partnership earns
money free of federal income taxes and passes most of it on to
investors, much like a real estate investment trust.
</P>
<P>
   Under the current plan, unit holders can choose to swap their
investment for units of a new public partnership, Boston Celtics
Limited Partnership II, or a private vehicle, Castle Creek
Partners.
</P>
<P>
   Castle Creek investors will continue to enjoy the tax advantages
of today's Celtics partnership. But they will be stuck with an
illiquid investment, unable to sell their units on a public market
at any time as they can today.
</P>
<P>
   Another catch: Castle Creek is open only to investors who own at
least 100 Celtics units. About 78 percent of registered Celtics
investors own fewer than 10 units, often bought as souvenirs rather
than securities.
</P>
<P>
   The new Celtics partnership owns a chunk of the business that
will earn less because it will be subjected to income taxes. But
the partnership units will trade publicly, just as they do today,
and investors who choose the option get other benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Unit holders of the new public partnership also will receive $1
cash per unit and an unsecured, 40-year note with a face value of
$20 and a coupon of 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   That package is hard to value, but some investors estimate the
new Celtics partership unit might be worth $6 and the publicly
traded note will be heavily discounted, perhaps down to $12. Add
the cash and the total package could be worth about $19.
</P>
<P>
   But the handicappers also warn that thin trading could skew the
actual price when the unit and the note begin trading next month.

COMPUTERS _ THEY'RE IN THE ARMY NOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ED OFFLEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT LEWIS _ Harnessing the power of computers to the American
soldier, the Army is preparing to formally unveil the first combat
division in history built from the ground up around the microchip
revolution.
</P>
<P>
   After five years of planning and experimentation with
state-of-the art computer technology embedded in communications and
weapons systems, the 4th Infantry Division at Fort Hood, Texas,
will be certified as ready for deployment in 18 months, said Gen.
William Hartzog.
</P>
<P>
   As commander of the Training and Doctrine Command, Hartzog has
led the Army-wide program to field the new systems.
</P>
<P>
   Known as Force XXI, for the 21st century campaigns in which it
will fight, the new Army structure aims at increasing combat
effectiveness, maneuverability and decision making through computer
applications throughout the combat and support forces, Hartzog said
in an interview at Fort Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   Units will use state-of-the-art M1A2 Abrams tanks and M3 Bradley
infantry vehicles, but will require fewer per brigade. The division
will require only 15,000 troops, instead of the 18,000 now on its
roster.
</P>
<P>
   The heart of the division will be an array of computer networks
that provide commanders and soldiers with unparalleled knowledge of
the battlefield before and during combat.
</P>
<P>
   The Force XXI concept emerged after the end of the Cold War as
Army leaders realized that future threats facing the United States
would likely bear little resemblance to the massive entrenched
Soviet Army in Europe, which the U.S. Army had designed itself to
fight, Hartzog said.
</P>
<P>
   Severe pressure to shrink the size of the Army, combined with
new threats from terrorists and spreading weapons of mass
destruction, impelled the service to embrace the technology
revolution, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The 4th Infantry Division, which consists of three heavy
brigades that rely on tanks and armored infantry carriers, will be
smaller but much more lethal due to new information systems used by
the commanding general and front-line riflemen, he said. While
retaining its combat punch for fighting in a conventional war, the
division can also be tailored for emergencies requiring a smaller
commitment.
</P>
<P>
   In a major field test last year at the Army's National Training
Center in Southern California, a brigade from the Texas-based
division demonstrated how its digital computer power translated
into battlefield success, Hartzog said. Examples included:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; el.3l &LR;
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)Surveillance: When an enemy force began invading the
unit's operational area, surveillance aircraft and, later, unmanned
aerial vehicles, tracked the formation and transmitted data showing
the location and route of advance, allowing the brigade to
immediately prepare for battle.
</P>
<P>
   _ Air strikes: Helicopters attached to the brigade capitalized
on the same sensors to conduct an attack on the enemy, destroying
its air defenses.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ground and air defense: Mobile systems such as Avenger
air-to-air missiles and the Javelin anti-tank weapon were found to
be increasingly lethal against the simulated enemy because their
units were able to deploy rapidly and accurately.
</P>
<P>
   _ Battle space dominance: Even though outnumbered, new
command-and-control systems enabled the digital brigade to
outmaneuver the enemy on an extended battlefield, particularly
because the unit's artillery had the technology to immediately
track and fire on targets.
</P>
<P>
   _ Logistics: In addition to maneuvering and fighting faster than
the enemy, computer technology also enabled the brigade to resupply
its combat units faster and more efficiently, allowing them to
return to the fight sooner.
</P>
<P>
   The current schedule is to equip and train the two heavy
divisions and the III Corps headquarters based at Fort Hood. The
1st Cavalry Division will be completed in the year 2003 and the
corps headquarters by 2005, Hartzog said.
</P>
<P>
   A parallel effort to add digital combat systems to the Army's
light divisions, particularly the 82nd Airborne and 101st Air
Assault Divisions, will proceed during the next decade, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging that the Army has historically been a very
conservative organization when it comes to radical restructuring or
introducing new technologies, Hartzog said the Force XXI program
has also aimed to accelerate the service's decision-making process,
particularly in terms of designing and procuring new weapons
systems.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line to the computer revolution is that the soldier
in combat will have the answer to three fundamental questions,
Hartzog said: ``Where am I? Where are my subordinates? Where is the
enemy?''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have that (information), you have something that has
never existed in the history of warfare,'' Hartzog said. ``We
intend to have the entire force ready by 2010,'' he said, referring
to the Army's mechanized and armor divisions.
</P>
<P>
   Hartzog, 56, has led the Army Training and Doctrine Command
since October 1994. He previously served as deputy commander of the
U.S. Atlantic Command and also commanded the 1st Infantry Division.
He is a combat veteran of Vietnam, where he served two tours.
</P>
<P>
   Hartzog was interviewed during a visit to the advanced ROTC
summer camp at Fort Lewis, where 4,000 cadets are undergoing field
training and leadership development this summer.

A LOOK AT THE TV SEASON JUST PAST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Every four years, World Cup soccer brings us some of the worst
acting this side of Cinemax in the wee hours. If they wanted to,
many of the world's elite booters could moonlight as guest
lecturers at the John Stockton Academy of Dramatic Flops in Short
Pants.
</P>
<P>
   Stockton plays professional basketball when he's not falling to
the floor in a heap. He could learn plenty by watching
international soccer players. Upon the most incidental contact,
these strapping, durable athletes fall faster than the fortunes of
the U.S. side. They take dives even when the nearest opponent is in
the next time zone. They writhe and grimace on the grass until the
guy with the magic water _ from Lourdes, we presume _ administers a
splash, and then they're ready for Act II.
</P>
<P>
   It's all so they can induce a referee to make a ruling in their
favor and simultaneously catch a breather in a game that knows no
timeouts. Often, the referees take the bait. Either way, the viewer
gets a steady dose of overacting that makes one look at ``Meego''
in a more favorable light.
</P>
<P>
   OK. Maybe not.
</P>
<P>
   But it does make one appreciate the good stuff on TV. And even
fake wrestling looks good alongside the melodramatic flops and
drops of World Cup soccer.
</P>
<P>
   In that spirit, we take our annual look at the best of the TV
season just past, hoping that the the occasional kick in the pants
won't send the network executives sprawling.
</P>
<P>
   Best new fall series to be renewed:
</P>
<P>
   This one is a no-brainer, even though ``Ally McBeal,''
September's most inventive new star vehicle, was leaking a little
oil by May. It's an affliction common to shows produced by the
supremely gifted David E. Kelley, whose creative juices sometimes
boil over and gum up the works.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Kelley's clever treatment of the old love-triangle
scenario made Calista Flockhart a legitimate star and gave Fox the
most talked-about new show of the season. Perhaps the best thing
about ``Ally McBeal'' is how it evolved into a fine ensemble piece
that showcased not just Flockhart's remarkable acting ability _ her
expressive face alone deserves an Emmy _ but also the talents of
Peter MacNicol, Greg Germann, Lisa Nicole Carson and Courtney
Thorne-Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Best new midseason
</P>
<P>
   series to be renewed:
</P>
<P>
   The frighteningly articulate teenagers of The WB's ``Dawson's
Creek'' can be a little hard to take at times, but Kevin
Williamson's bittersweet memoir of growing up in North Carolina
wins points for style and presentation.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that, in the telling, North Carolina, where the show
is filmed, becomes Massachusetts for some inexplicable reason. The
four principal cast members _ James Van Der Beek, Katie Holmes,
Joshua Jackson and Michelle Williams _ are appealing and convincing
as teens awakening to new realities. Sure it's soapy, but it's not
Aaron Spelling.
</P>
<P>
   Best new series to be canceled:
</P>
<P>
   If anyone needs proof that network executives don't really mean
it when they say, ``We have great faith in this year's lineup,''
consider ``Nothing Sacred.''
</P>
<P>
   On the theory that they have to fill 22 hours of programming
each week with something other than a test pattern, the networks do
a fair amount of guessing despite all their demographic research
and hocus-pocus-focus groups. ABC deserves some credit for taking a
flier on ``Nothing Sacred,'' a series about a Catholic priest
trying to reconcile his own beliefs with the dogma of his religion,
but it also deserves to do penance for failing to support it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing Sacred'' started out in a difficult time slot on
Thursday nights, and then was assigned Saturdays, where shows go to
die.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing that Saturday episodes draw smaller audiences, ABC owed
it to the producers to give ``Nothing Sacred'' sufficient time to
build a following. Instead, it pre-empted the show countless times
and then pulled it from the schedule with five shows still to air.
Hardly a vote of confidence.
</P>
<P>
   The official network explanation is that low ratings caused the
demise of ``Nothing Sacred.'' But to expect overnight success in
today's multichannel universe is just plain stupid.
</P>
<P>
   Best example of
</P>
<P>
   bottom-line programming:
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't a Top 20 show, but ``Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman''
regularly won its Saturday night time slot and had a loyal
following of fans after six seasons. The problem for CBS was that
most of those fans fell into the over-50 demographic that
advertisers loathe.
</P>
<P>
   The conventional Madison Avenue wisdom _ we use the term loosely
_ is that people over 50 are not nearly as susceptible to an
advertiser's blandishments as, say, a 25-year-old. Thus, CBS
couldn't charge as much for commercials on ``Dr. Quinn'' as it
could on lower-rated shows that appeal to younger viewers.
</P>
<P>
   I was never a fan of ``Dr. Quinn,'' but I still find CBS's
decision to dump it monumentally offensive.
</P>
<P>
   Best first impression
</P>
<P>
   that didn't last:
</P>
<P>
   Among comedies, ``Veronica's Closet'' had the best-made pilot
episode of the fall. Crisply directed and well acted, it appeared
to be more than just a half-hour of filler in the cushy hammock
between ``Seinfeld'' and ``ER.'' But, while delivering huge ratings
to NBC, it never delivered the quality entertainment its pilot
promised. Instead, it played like so many other interchangeable TV
comedies: shrill, forced and only occasionally funny.
</P>
<P>
   Kirstie Alley's neurotic romance expert, Veronica Chase, is
especially annoying, proving that the vein mined for several
seasons by ``Caroline in the City'' has not been exhausted.
</P>
<P>
   Best miniseries:
</P>
<P>
   NBC pulled out all the stops with ``Merlin,'' a new take on the
Arthurian legend, and USA Network can rightly be proud of ``Moby
Dick,'' featuring Patrick Stewart as the troubled Capt. Ahab, but
scenes from A&AMP;E's bubbly and beguiling remake of ``Tom Jones'' are
as fresh in the mind today as they were on the screen in April.
</P>
<P>
   It was sheer pleasure to watch Max Beesley and Samantha Morton
take Tom Jones and Sophie Western through the English countryside
in Henry Fielding's comedy of errors and missteps. Every aspect of
the six-hour project _ acting, photography, costumes, script,
direction _ was at the top of its craft.
</P>
<P>
   Best midseason stink bomb:
</P>
<P>
   This one's a tie between ``Ask Harriet'' and ``The Closer.'' And
tying them together even further is this curiosity: Ed Asner had a
supporting role in both, and it's hard to tell which one made him
more uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's ``Ask Harriet'' debuted first, with the premise of a
sexist-pig sports columnist getting canned and returning to the
same newspaper as a female advice columnist. Anthony Tyler Quinn
was the guy in drag, and Asner was the newspaper's clueless owner
who found him/her attractive. On the wince scale, it was easily a
10.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Closer'' marked Tom Selleck's return to a regular series
since his days on ``Magnum, P.I.,'' but it was more a reminder that
staying away is sometimes the wiser course of action. Selleck
played an advertising executive who started up his own small agency
after being fired by a big one. Asner was the agency's seasoned,
all-knowing creative director.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad the show didn't have one.
</P>
<P>
   Best-promoted series finale
</P>
<P>
   If there's someone in this country who didn't know ``Seinfeld''
was ending its nine-season run in May, he may have a future as a
universal juror, untainted by exposure to the media. He also could
do well as a continuing guest on the talk-show circuit: ``Tomorrow,
on the next `Oprah,' the guy who was blissfully unaware of the
`Seinfeld' finale.''
</P>
<P>
   The obsessive way the media covered the event was really quite
embarrassing, and the runup to the series-ending episode probably
made it impossible for Jerry Seinfeld and Larry David to satisfy
such inflated expectations.
</P>
<P>
   NBC also deserves some blame for greedily stretching the thing
over two hours. ``Seinfeld'' was always at its sarcastic best in a
tightly produced half-hour. Its finale suffered from a serious case
of bloat.
</P>
<P>
   Best series finale:
</P>
<P>
   At one hour, the finale of ``The Larry Sanders Show'' was also a
tad too long, but it was everything the ``Seinfeld'' swan song
wasn't: sharp, satirical and scorching.
</P>
<P>
   Garry Shandling never won an Emmy for ``Larry Sanders,''
probably because its subject matter _ a behind-the-scenes look at a
not-so-fictitious talk show _ cut too close to Hollywood's version
of reality. But fans of the show will always remember it as a
comedy that knew what it was trying to say about human frailty and
insecurity.
</P>
<P>
   The finale was especially touching and funny at the same time.
Pretty much what you'd want when you're saying goodbye.

PEOPLE ARE GOING TO THE DOGS _ TO RELIEVE OFFICE STRESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CAROL SMITH  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Your boss getting on your nerves? Work driving you up a wall?
</P>
<P>
   Try petting a puppy.
</P>
<P>
   On several occasions, a Seattle Post-Intelligencer employee has
brought a batch of English cocker spaniel pups to work, and the
reaction has been both swift and amusing. It is a sight to see
normally hard-nosed reporters down on the floor making kissy-poo
and talking baby-talk to little dogs.
</P>
<P>
   ``You really see people's personalities come out,'' said Katy
Khakpour, P-I receptionist and occasional puppy-minder. ``Everyone
goes crazy when they see a dog in the office.''
</P>
<P>
   Using animals to help with work place stress is an idea that is
catching on. The Oregon Humane Society in Portland, for example, is
mounting a pilot ``Animals in the Workplace'' program with five
small companies.
</P>
<P>
   The response so far has been enthusiastic, said program manager
Virginia Dagg, whose first client was Cascade Direct, a small
Portland direct-mail business. ``Employees just went crazy _ they
loved it.''
</P>
<P>
   Although it is one of only a handful of humane societies that
appear to be doing it, Dagg has had calls from interested
organizations all over the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care where you work, I don't care if it's the most
wonderful job in the world, there's still a stress factor.''
</P>
<P>
   But studies have shown that being around animals can lower
people's blood pressure and otherwise reduce stress.
</P>
<P>
   The idea for pets in the workplace grew out of the success of
similar programs to bring animals to nursing homes, hospitals and
other settings for animal-assisted therapy.
</P>
<P>
   The animals in Dagg's program are not from the shelter, but are
already trained for animal-assisted therapy. They and their
handlers will typically have had about 25 hours of hands-on
coursework to make sure the animals are comfortable around people,
loving and interactive. Once the program is fully under way, Dagg
anticipates the animals will go to each workplace about once a
month.
</P>
<P>
   Other companies are letting animals come to work on a more
informal basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's gaining in popularity here and there,'' said Maureen
Fredrickson, vice president of the Renton-based Delta Society, a
national organization that trains service animals for people with
disabilities, as well as handlers and animals for animal-assisted
therapy programs. ``As more information gets out about how animals
reduce stress, and more companies are trying to alleviate stress,
more companies are considering it.''
</P>
<P>
   But companies that try it have to be careful to respect the
needs of employees who don't like or are allergic to animals, she
said. The animals should always be kept away from people who don't
want to be near them.
</P>
<P>
   But many people enjoy seeing other's pets, she said. ``We see
people taking little stress breaks to play with them.''
</P>
<P>
   Some will ``borrow'' an animal to go for a walk. ``It's real
interesting to watch the office dynamics. It makes people much more
approachable.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, any pet who comes to work must have ``appropriate
business skills,'' she said. They must be controllable and under
control at all times. They can't interrupt people, and must be
clean and well-groomed. The animals also have to behave
appropriately around other office pets.
</P>
<P>
   Delta, for example, has between five and 10 dogs, three or four
birds, two or three rabbits and assorted cats reporting to work
every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can't go hunting'' each other, she said. ``We've had one
or two swallowing incidents, luckily they were non-fatal.''
</P>
<P>
   The regular on-the-job pets tend to form their own office
families, she said. The dogs know not to bother the cats, and
vice-versa. Some of them even pal around together.
</P>
<P>
   The federal Americans With Disabilities Act, passed in 1994,
also has been a driving force in introducing more animals to the
workplace, Fredrickson said. ``Public places are experiencing
well-trained animals for the first time. People are seeing that the
animals don't bring in 4 million fleas or knock over the
merchandise, that animals can be well-behaved.''
</P>
<P>
   Louis Richmond, of Richmond Public Relations Inc. in downtown
Seattle, brings 18-month-old Molly, a chocolate standard poodle, to
work on days the dog doesn't go with his wife, Betty Ann Richmond.
Betty Ann uses Molly as part of her therapy practice in Fremont.
</P>
<P>
   ``She humanizes the workplace,'' said Louis Richmond, who
renegotiated his lease to accommodate the dog and even has her sit
in on the occasional board meeting. ``People pet her in the
elevator all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   And she draws attention on her walks through Seattle's city
streets, he said. ``What people do, more than anything, is they
smile,'' he said.

CELTICS PARTNERSHIP INVESTORS HEAD DOWN TO THE BUZZER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (f and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE BAILEY AND STEVEN SYRE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rick Pitino would call a timeout to regroup if his Boston
Celtics were under this much pressure.
</P>
<P>
   But it is the team's publicly traded partnership units that are
under the gun, falling sharply on relatively heavy volume over the
past two weeks. The issue: a plan that would split the Celtics
master limited partnership into two new entities.
</P>
<P>
   Unit holders can swap for an interest in either of the new
partnerships and their level of ownership will remain unchanged,
though each of the investment vehicles has distinct advantages and
problems.
</P>
<P>
   But confusion over the complicated reorganization plan and
questions about the way it has been advanced are prompting some
investors to simply sell instead of choosing between one of the two
new ownership vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Selling pressure has been building as the June 30 deadline to
choose one of the two partnerships approaches. Celtics units,
priced at 16 3/4 Thursday, have slumped nearly 20 percent in the
last four weeks, and trading volume is running at about 10 times
normal levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems that there is the aura of impropriety, although that
may not be the actual case,'' said Sheryl Marshall, a broker at
Donaldson, Lufkin, Jenrette who has bought Celtics units for her
customers.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall and other brokers complain that the reorganization is
taking place without any independent appraisal or ``fairness''
opinion from outside experts, despite potential conflicts of
interest between public unit holders and the Celtics general
partner, among others. The potential conflict is cited in public
documents describing the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Celtics officials said they did not obtain a fairness opinion
because the reorganization will have no impact on the ownership
interest of unit holders. Officials also said professional
assurances could have cost several million dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was structured to make it as equitable as possible, so
everyone maintained their portion of the business,'' said chief
financial officer Richard Pond. ``Proportionately, no one is going
to be in any different position on July 1 than they were on June
30.''
</P>
<P>
   An earlier reorganization plan created by Celtics chairman Paul
Gaston, which never made it to the board for a vote, probably would
have caused more controversy. That plan, detailed in securities
documents, would have substantially reduced team ownership by
Gaston and his affiliates in exchange for other investments. The
initial plan was scrapped after financial advisers estimated the
team's value at $140 million to $160 million.
</P>
<P>
   The idea: Make sure everyone ended up with the same value,
dollar for dollar, but rearrange the actual assets. Besides the
basketball team, the Celtics partnership holds nearly $100 million
in cash and securities.
</P>
<P>
   Gaston and his affiliates currently own about 50.1 percent of
the Celtics partnership. The initial plan would have reduced the
investment in the team to about 20 percent through the use of two
new, related partnerships. In return for the reduced team
ownership, the Gaston group would have gotten other investments of
comparable value.
</P>
<P>
   The catch: placing a value on the team. An investment advisory
firm, Houlihan Lokey Howard &AMP; Zukin, was hired to assess the entire
deal and, among other duties, come up with the preliminary estimate
of the team's value.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics said the investment firm's ``draft presentation''
was not a factor in the decision to drop Gaston's plan. But the
partnership later held ``informal consultations'' with what was
then known as Morgan Stanley &AMP; Co., the large investment firm once
associated with former Celtics president Stephen Schram.
</P>
<P>
   Celtics executives said in documents that they decided it was
too hard to obtain a reliable appraisal of the team's value for the
plan to work.
</P>
<P>
   But the documents also said Houlihan Lokey balked when the
Celtics asked the investment firm to back up their public summary
of events in writing with the US Securities and Exchange
Commission. Executives at Houlihan Lokey did not return calls
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics are being forced to change their ownership structure
because a special tax status extended to a small group of master
limited partnerships is expiring. The Celtics partnership earns
money free of federal income taxes and passes most of it on to
investors, much like a real estate investment trust.
</P>
<P>
   Under the current plan, unit holders can choose to swap their
investment for units of a new public partnership, Boston Celtics
Limited Partnership II, or a private vehicle, Castle Creek
Partners.
</P>
<P>
   Castle Creek investors will continue to enjoy the tax advantages
of today's Celtics partnership. But they will be stuck with an
illiquid investment, unable to sell their units on a public market
at any time as they can today.
</P>
<P>
   Another catch: Castle Creek is open only to investors who own at
least 100 Celtics units. About 78 percent of registered Celtics
investors own fewer than 10 units, often bought as souvenirs rather
than securities.
</P>
<P>
   The new Celtics partnership owns a chunk of the business that
will earn less because it will be subjected to income taxes. But
the partnership units will trade publicly, just as they do today,
and investors who choose the option get other benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Unit holders of the new public partnership also will receive $1
cash per unit and an unsecured, 40-year note with a face value of
$20 and a coupon of 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   That package is hard to value, but some investors estimate the
new Celtics partership unit might be worth $6 and the publicly
traded note will be heavily discounted, perhaps down to $12. Add
the cash and the total package could be worth about $19.
</P>
<P>
   But the handicappers also warn that thin trading could skew the
actual price when the unit and the note begin trading next month.

`GONE WITH THE WIND,' BUT NOT FORGOTTEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By AMY BIANCOLLI  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Gone with the Wind'': It's immune from criticism.
</P>
<P>
   It is. Fifty-nine years after it was first released, this grand
old dame of American film is too plump with its own significance to
be judged by modern eyes. Too much time has passed since its
premiere _ too much history, too much celluloid, too many
thunderous shifts in pop culture and society. Acting has changed.
Movies have changed. Acceptance of racist and sexist stereotypes
has changed.
</P>
<P>
   If ``Gone with the Wind'' were a few years older, it would be
eligible for Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Yet almost six decades after Rhett and Scarlett first swapped
insults in the Twelve Oaks library, the two of them are back at it
up on the big screen. And despite the yawning gaps between movies
then and movies now, producer David O. Selznick's vast, sumptuous
saga of love and loss in the Civil War is still an entertaining and
blisteringly sexy film.
</P>
<P>
   There's no nudity to speak of (except for a couple of swaddled
infants), and what kisses there are remain inflexibly
close-mouthed. But big deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``He smiles as though he knows what I look like without my
shimmy!'' gasps Scarlett (Vivien Leigh), voicing the subtext to
Clark Gable's famously crinkling leer. With Gable in a movie, no
one had to disrobe; his glance did it for them, with humor and
economy.
</P>
<P>
   And ``Gone with the Wind'' is, despite its nearly four-hour
running time (with intermission), an economical film. It wastes no
time in its fated pairings, its portrait of an Old South felled by
war or its tear-jerking obeisances to melodrama. The thing zooms.
Victor Fleming was a no-nonsense director, so we probably have him
to thank for the movie's fleet narrative although he was just one
of several people (Selznick and George Cukor included) who had a
hand in the film's direction. Production was infamously unwieldy
and cluttered with egos.
</P>
<P>
   The plot is, as ever, based on Margaret Mitchell's best-selling
novel about Scarlett O'Hara, the scrappy young daughter of an Irish
plantation owner (Thomas Mitchell) in pre-bellum Georgia. The film
opens on Scarlett's bickering with Mammy (Hattie McDaniel), her
flirtations with beaus and her undignified pleas to Ashley Wilkes
(Leslie Howard), a weak-spirited, whippet-thin dreamer who's about
to marry his cousin Melanie (Olivia De Havilland, saintly as ever)
but lusts after Scarlett nevertheless.
</P>
<P>
   Scarlett lusts right back. The film is all about desire, or the
lack of it there's plenty in her clutches with Ashley, none in her
marriages to two sad sacks, and quite enough to explode a warehouse
in her third, to Rhett. Underscoring lust are the movie's
brilliant, flame-red set-pieces: the burning of Atlanta, the
exhausted trek to Tara or those silhouettes of Scarlett against a
throbbing ruby sky.
</P>
<P>
   ``As God is my witness, I'll never be hungry again!'' she
swears, jiggling a radish at the heavens. Up swells Max Steiner's
effulgent Romantic music, signaling it's time to cry. It would be
sacrilege not to.
</P>
<P>
   Which is, after all, the dilemma: This movie is too well-loved
(by this moviegoer and by moviegoers in general) to rip apart.
Certain scenes inspire specific Pavlovian responses a knowing
laugh, a catch in one's breath, a gasp of suspense or a full-opera
sob of grief. A bonk on the head for anyone unfazed by the infamous
pony accident. But part of the joy in watching ``Gone with the
Wind'' is the sweet familiarity of it, like the moist scent of
perfume from a long-absent friend. To watch it again is to inhale a
cloud of nostalgia.
</P>
<P>
   Whether any of it will interest young audiences remains to be
seen. Why New Line Cinema chose to re-release ``Gone with the
Wind'' isn't entirely clear, but it might have something to do with
the millions of teen-age girls out there who shed fulsome tears
over ``Titanic'' presumably they're in the mood for another
star-crossed couple.
</P>
<P>
   The parallels between the two films are striking and much
chewed-over (both are long, romantic epics set against backdrops of
massive human suffering), but just how those similarities will
translate into box office figures is hard to say. Will 13-year-olds
go ga-ga over Clark Gable's rough allure? Will pubescent boys do
back flips over Vivien Leigh? If not, who will pay to see it?
</P>
<P>
   Vintage-movie buffs. Viewers of a certain age. And, hopefully,
anyone of any age who enjoys the thrill of a terrific old film
which ``Gone with the Wind'' is, and always will be, regardless of
its standing as historical and cultural artifact.

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The film looks and sounds gorgeous, thanks to a newly restored
print (the first to use the Technicolor dye process since 1961) and
a digitally remastered sound track. And although its square frame
looks jarringly boxy in a wide-screen multiplex, the tale is as
broad, as human and as minutely detailed as ever. Look there for
wounded Confederate soldiers lined up on the streets of Atlanta
(one out of three is a dummy); look there for Rhett and Scarlett's
hungry kiss against the rust-red sky outside Tara; look there for
the grand wine staircase where Scarlett argues with Rhett, then
falls.
</P>
<P>
   It's all there, right down to Mammy's rustling silk petticoat
(red again) and the nostalgic strains of ``Dixie.'' Unfortunately,
the film is nostalgic about Dixie there's no escaping its idealized
portrait of the master-slave relationship or the inherent racism in
some of its black characters.
</P>
<P>
   Prissy, the pip-voiced slave played by Butterfly McQueen, gets
the worst of it; she's portrayed as both stupid and boastful,
drawing harsh verbal rebukes and one nasty slap in the face from
the annoyed Miss Scarlett. The ``birthin' babies'' sequence does
not wear well. Nor does the movie's most celebrated scene, in which
a drunken Rhett threatens to crush Scarlett's head in his hands and
then carries her upstairs to rape her.
</P>
<P>
   This once qualified as romance (Scarlett coos kittenishly the
morning after); it now qualifies as domestic violence. Rhett Butler
is not a man made for post-feminist, late-20th-century world _ ``A
good lashing with a buggy whip would benefit you immensely,'' he
says _ and neither is Gable.
</P>
<P>
   Although Gable's schtick seems dated now, it was an appealing
movie fantasy: He embodied bullish masculinity scant years before
sex roles changed and culture veered toward the feminine. He was,
in a way, machismo's last hurrah.
</P>
<P>
   Scarlett herself is a tough chick independent, selfish,
ambitious, coquettish when it suits her and completely indifferent
to society's expectations. If Rhett is a retro-man, Scarlett is a
proto-feminist, a woman so unconfined by convention (she dances a
reel in mourning) that even her worst character flaws are proof of
a fiery rebel. Leigh's performance is all in the right eyebrow; it
waggles magnificently whenever Scarlett frets, or schemes, or plots
revenge.
</P>
<P>
   During a rare moment of self-doubt, Scarlett admits that she's
afraid of dying and going to hell. ``You look pretty healthy,''
soothes Rhett. ``And maybe there isn't any hell.''
</P>
<P>
   But Scarlett needn't worry. So long as she as Rhett to snipe
at, Tara to run and radishes to wave, she'll always look healthy.
And she'll never go to hell.
</P>

SUPREME COURT DECISIONS FAVOR VICTIMS OF SEX HARASSMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (EDs: REMOVES last clause beginning: and warned... in 8th graf
pvs.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN FREEDMAN  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court made it significantly harder
Friday for private and public employers to defend themselves
against sexual harassment charges by claiming they were unaware of
what lower-level supervisors were doing.
</P>
<P>
   In a pair of 7-2 decisions, the court wrapped up its 1997-1998
term by ruling that employers cannot use this defense because the
federal civil rights law that bars employer sex discrimination or
harassment equates an employer with his or her ``agents'' or
supervisors.
</P>
<P>
   So if a supervisor engages in harassment, the employer is
subject to ``vicarious liability,'' the court said.
</P>
<P>
   The justices also made it more difficult for employers to claim
they are not liable in cases of threats by a supervisor to an
employee to have sex or else if the threats were not carried out
and the victim's career did not suffer.
</P>
<P>
   In its decisions, the court promulgated a new standard for
determining what kinds of defenses employers can raise in such
cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a person with supervisory authority discriminates in
terms and conditions of subordinates' employment, his actions
necessarily draw upon his superior position over people who report
to him,'' Justice David Souter wrote. ``An employee generally
cannot check a supervisor's abusive conduct the same way that she
might deal with abuse from a co-worker.''
</P>
<P>
   Souter's opinion involved charges by Beth Ann Faragher that when
she worked as a lifeguard in Boca Raton, Fla. between 1985 and
1990, supervisors had constantly made lewd remarks to her and had
engaged in ``uninvited and offensive touching.'' One supervisor
told her to ``date me or clean the toilets for a year.''
</P>
<P>
   The other case involved a Chicago saleswoman, Kimberly Ellerth,
who quit her job with Burlington Industries Inc. in 1994 after 15
months because a supervisor had told her to ``loosen up.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellerth's lawsuit said she quit because of the harassment by
Theodore Slowik, a New York-based vice president of sales and
marketing in her division. He actually supervised Ellerth's
supervisor but in the course of business dealt with her on a
regular basis.
</P>
<P>
   Ellerth, now a homemaker in Belvidere, Ill., alleged that Slowik
touched her inappropriately and told offensive jokes. She said he
once told her, ``You know, Kim, I could make your life very hard or
very easy at Burlington.'' But he never followed through with the
threat.
</P>
<P>
   Writing for the court in that case, Justice Anthony M. Kennedy
found that Burlington was responsible. ``An employer is subject to
vicarious liability to a victimized employee for an actionable
hostile environment created by a supervisor with immediate (or
successively higher) authority over the employee.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that ``when no tangible employment action is taken, a
defending employer may raise an affirmative defense to liability or
damages, subject to proof by a preponderance of the evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   But to succeed in such a defense, employers would have to show
they ``exercised reasonable care to prevent or correct promptly any
sexually harassing behavior'' and that ``the employee unreasonably
failed to take advantage of any preventive or corrective
opportunities provided by the employer or to avoid harm
otherwise,'' Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   Dissenting were Justices Clarence Thomas and Antonin Scalia.
Thomas, writing for the two, said the court ``manufactures a rule
that employers are vicariously liable if supervisors create a
sexually hostile work environment, subject to an affirmative
defense that the court barely attempts to define.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas objected that the court's rule ``applies even if the
employer has a policy against sexual harassment, the employee knows
about the policy and the employee never informs anyone in a
position of authority about the supervisor's conduct.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday the high court made it much harder for students who
are sexually harassed by teachers to hold school districts
financially responsible. But that decision was based on a separate
federal law dealing with discrimination in education programs.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's rulings revived Faragher's lawsuit against Boca
Raton, Fla., and kept alive Ellerth's suit against Burlington.
</P>
<P>
   The decision in the Burlington case conceivably could aid Paula
Jones' effort to revive her sexual-harassment lawsuit against
President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Jones accused Clinton of propositioning her when he was
Arkansas governor and she was a state employee. A federal judge,
relying on a standard imposed by the appeals court with
jurisdiction over Arkansas, threw out the lawsuit and said
employees can collect damages only if their refusal to submit to
sexual demands results in on-the-job retaliation.In Mrs. Jones'
case, the judge ruled that she had not shown any adverse on-the-job
consequences.

`HEAVEN' LACKS VITALITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BARBARA SHULGASSER  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Under Heaven'' is ``The Wings of the Dove'' set in late 20th
century America. As the Henry James novel has already been filmed
as is, it is easy to see how something in writer-director Meg
Richman's re-conception has let the air seep out of a pretty sexy
idea.
</P>
<P>
   As in the James novel, the set-up involves a poor girl whose
desires are not unreasonable. She merely wants the man she loves to
make enough money for them to marry. In this case, the girl is a
waitress named Cynthia (Molly Parker) and the guy is a drunken
loafer named Buck (Aden Young, a tall Australian good at accents
who plays another sex object in ``Cousin Bette'').
</P>
<P>
   Fed up with her boyfriend's torpor, Cynthia leaves him (could
Buck have been named a tad bit less obviously?) and takes a job
caring for a terminally ill and impossibly angelic young woman
named Eleanor (Joely Richardson). Eleanor is immensely rich, she
isn't going to live long, and she doesn't have any family. If
Cynthia plays her cards right, she calculates, she can get her
hands on some of that money.
</P>
<P>
   Although the ultimate plot isn't fully hatched at the start,
Cynthia introduces Buck to Eleanor with a lie. Hoping Eleanor will
hire Buck as a gardener, she says he is her half brother. She's
already described her ex-boyfriend as a screw-up, and why would
anyone hire a screw-up?
</P>
<P>
   Once Buck moves into the cottage on the estate, he and Cynthia
sneak about, hiding the true nature of their relationship. But soon
Buck's sympathy and hormones are aroused and it isn't long before
he and Eleanor have fallen madly in love.
</P>
<P>
   Eleanor eventually figures out who Buck really is, which doesn't
dissuade her from wanting to marry him and leave him everything.
Cynthia begins to regret her folly but still believes she and Buck
can end up together with all of Eleanor's money. By the time this
is discussed in the movie, you don't really care what happens to
any of them.
</P>
<P>
   Richman's script and direction are sorely devoid of vitality,
which a story this emotionally and sexually convoluted must have to
work.
</P>
<P>
   That Buck, who customarily brought home dinner by shoplifting,
should suddenly develop a conscience at the end of the film seems a
bit farfetched. And that the movie should end with such sugary
sweetness belies all that came before it.

`OUT OF SIGHT,' OUT OF MIND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BARBARA SHULGASSER  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Out of Sight'' is, like the terrific ``Get Shorty,'' based on
an Elmore Leonard novel and produced by Jersey Films. This time,
that teaming-up gave birth to a sad and deflated follow-up.
</P>
<P>
   Writer Scott Frank hit a home run with his ``Get Shorty''
adaptation. But he's brought down his batting average considerably
with this one. Perhaps, also, ``Out of Sight'' needed the energetic
and stylish hand of ``Get Shorty'' director Barry Sonnenfeld.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, a sad-sackish Steven Soderbergh (``sex, lies and
videotape'') comes at this material looking as if his mind was on
something else, something much, much more depressing.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinarily, a motion picture soundtrack reflects or enhances the
mood created by the picture itself. This is not the case here. The
jaunty music by David Holmes, reminiscent of the ``Get Shorty''
score, reminds us every time we hear it of what this movie
decidedly isn't. Interesting. Humorous. Upbeat. Succinct.
</P>
<P>
   The other big problem is that ``Out of Sight'' stars Bruce
Willis _ except George Clooney is playing him, and apart from the
fact that Clooney is wonderful to look at, he just doesn't wear a
smirk well. Willis looks cool when he says smarmy things with a
smile. Clooney just looks smarmy.
</P>
<P>
   Clooney plays Jack Foley, a recidivist bank robber who has been
busted many times. He is cheeky and, of course, handsome, but the
sad fact is that basically he is dumb, if you judge a person by how
well he learns from his mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   When he botches a prison escape by throwing federal marshal
Karen Sisco (Jennifer Lopez) in the trunk of the getaway car, you
can't really figure out the sense of it. When he falls in love with
her while making small talk in the trunk together _ don't ask! _
the movie becomes a little too goofy for words. But when he decides
to take her along when they switch to a safer car, my faith in the
rest of the movie was seriously tested.
</P>
<P>
   The plot device of pushing a male criminal and a female law
enforcement officer together romantically is getting to be a habit.
We've seen it in ``Raising Arizona'' and ``Children of the
Revolution.'' But both of those were farces. ``Out of Sight'' is
filmed with a plodding ordinariness that precludes our just
suspending disbelief and going along for a kooky ride.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Jack is regularly risking his freedom and
jeopardizing his next big job for the love of a woman who works for
the enemy, I had pretty much felt disinvited from entering the
fiction of the movie.
</P>
<P>
   With a lot of out of place slow-motion and freeze-frame
activity, Soderbergh seems to be trying for a stylish, almost
``Thomas Crown Affair'' look, but instead all the fancy footwork
serves to bog down the movie.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from Clooney, the movie is populated by a cast of great
actors. Ving Rhames, who is as fun to watch playing a villain as he
is doing the hero, plays Jack's best pal, Buddy. Don Cheadle is
Snoop, the psycho they know from prison. Albert Brooks, made up to
be bald and paunchy, is fine as an annoying white-collar criminal.
And Isaiah Washington, Catherine Keener and Steve Zahn are all good
in small parts.

 `INSOMNIAC' OFFERS A DREAMY DEBUT FOR DeBARTOLO  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BARBARA SHULGASSER  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Writer-director Tiffanie DeBartolo's film debut is the admirable
``Dream for an Insomniac.'' Set in San Francisco (her father is
49ers owner Eddie DeBartolo), the story concerns an aspiring
actress named Francesca (Ione Skye), who is planning to move to Los
Angeles in 48 hours. Then she meets the love of her life and, in
the tradition of all great romances, everything is turned upside
down.
</P>
<P>
   Frankie works in Cafe Blue Eyes for her Uncle Leo (the affable
Seymour Cassel). She is an experienced insomniac and easily bored
by the men she dates. In other words, she is a tortured romantic in
the most fundamental sense: she believes that love isn't true if
not accompanied by blinding passion. When her uncle hires David
(MacKenzie Astin) as a counter man, she knows that she was right.
</P>
<P>
   David is an aspiring writer just in from the Midwest and he,
too, is immediately smitten. From the start, they are trying to
stump each other by citing arcane quotations. They can barely keep
their eyes off each other. Actually, who could blame them?
</P>
<P>
   Skye has an Ava Gardner slithery sultriness. She moves like a
cat, she smiles as if she knows showing her teeth is a lethal act.
It doesn't hurt that the cafe plays Sinatra music behind all that
slithering.
</P>
<P>
   Astin is as charming and beautiful as the young Gary Cooper. He
is a genetically perfect combination of his parents, Patty Duke and
John Astin, with a little Edward Burns thrown in. In fact, the best
reference would be to describe him as a happy Montgomery Clift.
</P>
<P>
   Frankie reads David's work, praises it and learns that he hasn't
written a word in ages. So they make a deal. He will try to cure
her insomnia and she will try to cure his writer's block. All of
the playful dialogue _ and this movie is joyfully full of talk _ is
handled well in DeBartolo's savvy script and given life by actors
who seem to truly embody the idealism of the characters.
</P>
<P>
   I mean, we know David is a catch when he reads Frankie a bedtime
story by Dr. Seuss. He's adorable. And so is she.
</P>
<P>
   And everywhere you turn, secondary characters are filling in the
slow moments with inspired performances. Jennifer Aniston is
terribly funny as Frankie's best friend and fellow actress, sliding
into accents, French, Southern, Larchmont Lockjaw and, just in case
she gets hired by a Toronto filmmaker, Canadian.
</P>
<P>
   For the obligatory dramatic tension there's cousin Rob (Michael
Landes), who can't tell Leo he's gay, and David's secret
girlfriend, Molly (Leslie Stevens), a perfectly nice girl who,
frankly, doesn't have a chance in a fairy tale like this.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Frogs and toads throughout the world are being killed by a
fungus that is new to science. The fungus, which coats their
undersides and legs, is thought to be suffocating the animals,
which breathe through their skins. It could be a major factor
underlying the decline in amphibian populations reported worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   The fungus has been found independently by teams in the United
States and Australia. It belongs to a new genus of chytrid, a group
thought to be related to the earliest fungi. Although other
chytrids parasitize a range of organisms, from microscopic algae to
insects, they have never before been found to cause disease in
vertebrates.
</P>
<P>
   The fungus, which has yet to be given a scientific name, is
known to have struck down 10 species of frogs and toads from 10
locations in Australia, seven species from two locations in Panama,
a toad from southern California and six species of frogs in four
American zoos and aquariums.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's little doubt that this is a worldwide phenomenon,''
says Allan Pessier, a veterinary pathologist at the National
Zoological Park in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists don't yet know if the fungus is the primary cause
of death, or whether it is killing animals who have been weakened
by other factors, such as ultraviolet radiation penetrating the
atmosphere due to the thinned ozone layer or agricultural
chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many factors could be at work, but the fungus is probably
right up there,'' Pessier says.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody knows where the fungus came from, or how it is spread. It
was first noticed by Don Nichols, a colleague of Pessier's at the
zoo, in arroyo toads, Bufo microscaphus californicus, from a
captive colony in California.
</P>
<P>
   At first Nichols didn't recognize it as a fungus. Because
infected skin contained a proliferation of round cells, rather than
fungal filaments, Nichols thought it was a protozoan.
</P>
<P>
   Earl Green of the Maryland Animal Health Laboratory in College
Park made the same mistake when he examined specimens collected in
1996 and 1997 from western Panama by Karen Lips of St. Lawrence
University in Canton, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   By 1996, Nichols and Pessier had begun to doubt the protozoan
diagnosis. Then an outbreak of the infection began to ravage the
National Zoological Park's population of blue poison-dart frogs,
Dentrobates azureus, which come from Surinam. Nichols and Pessier
teamed up with Joyce Longcore, a chytrid taxonomist at the
University of Maine in Orono, who described her findings to the
Mycological Society of America in Puerto Rico last week.
</P>
<P>
   The same fungus has since been found in other captive amphibians
in the United States. It has been seen at the Bronx Zoo,
Philadelphia Zoo and the Shedd Aquarium in Chicago. Nichols and
Pessier say it was present in their zoo as early as 1988, when two
specimens of White's tree frog, Litoria caerulea, which come from
Australia, were struck down.
</P>
<P>
   Lips and Green, meanwhile, have joined forces with scientists
headed by Alex Hyatt and Lee Berger of the Australian Animal Health
Laboratory in Geelong, near Melbourne, and Rick Speare of James
Cook University in Townsville, Queensland.
</P>
<P>
   The chytrid was first found in Australia in 1993 at the
Melbourne Zoo _ in the sharp-snouted day frog, Taudactylus
acutirostris, from Queensland. Again, it was initially thought to
be a protozoan.
</P>
<P>
   The AAHL team has found the fungus in 115 animals from 17
species from Panama and Australia. These range from the huge cane
toad, Bufo marinus, introduced into Australia, to the dainty
harlequin frog, Atelopus varius, from Panama. ``Endangered frogs in
high-altitude rain forest streams seem to be the most vulnerable,
but we don't know why,'' Berger says.
</P>
<P>
   The fungus did not show up in 28 amphibians from 13 species
collected in Costa Rica and Panama between 1987 and 1995,
suggesting that it has only recently become a problem. Berger has
also transmitted the disease to healthy frogs exposed in water to
skin scrapings from infected frogs. The animals died. The team's
research will be published next month in the Proceedings of the
National Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   Pessier believes the frogs and toads are suffocating because of
the fungal growth and because, in reaction to the fungus, they are
laying down extra layers of keratin in their skin. Another

<P>
   Frogs and toads throughout the world are being killed by a
fungus that is new to science. The fungus, which coats their
undersides and legs, is thought to be suffocating the animals,
which breathe through their skins. It could be a major factor
underlying the decline in amphibian populations reported worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   The fungus has been found independently by teams in the United
States and Australia. It belongs to a new genus of chytrid, a group
thought to be related to the earliest fungi. Although other
chytrids parasitize a range of organisms, from microscopic algae to
insects, they have never before been found to cause disease in
vertebrates.
</P>
<P>
   The fungus, which has yet to be given a scientific name, is
known to have struck down 10 species of frogs and toads from 10
locations in Australia, seven species from two locations in Panama,
a toad from southern California and six species of frogs in four
American zoos and aquariums.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's little doubt that this is a worldwide phenomenon,''
says Allan Pessier, a veterinary pathologist at the National
Zoological Park in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists don't yet know if the fungus is the primary cause
of death, or whether it is killing animals who have been weakened
by other factors, such as ultraviolet radiation penetrating the
atmosphere due to the thinned ozone layer or agricultural
chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many factors could be at work, but the fungus is probably
right up there,'' Pessier says.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody knows where the fungus came from, or how it is spread. It
was first noticed by Don Nichols, a colleague of Pessier's at the
zoo, in arroyo toads, Bufo microscaphus californicus, from a
captive colony in California.
</P>
<P>
   At first Nichols didn't recognize it as a fungus. Because
infected skin contained a proliferation of round cells, rather than
fungal filaments, Nichols thought it was a protozoan.
</P>
<P>
   Earl Green of the Maryland Animal Health Laboratory in College
Park made the same mistake when he examined specimens collected in
1996 and 1997 from western Panama by Karen Lips of St. Lawrence
University in Canton, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   By 1996, Nichols and Pessier had begun to doubt the protozoan
diagnosis. Then an outbreak of the infection began to ravage the
National Zoological Park's population of blue poison-dart frogs,
Dentrobates azureus, which come from Surinam. Nichols and Pessier
teamed up with Joyce Longcore, a chytrid taxonomist at the
University of Maine in Orono, who described her findings to the
Mycological Society of America in Puerto Rico last week.
</P>
<P>
   The same fungus has since been found in other captive amphibians
in the United States. It has been seen at the Bronx Zoo,
Philadelphia Zoo and the Shedd Aquarium in Chicago. Nichols and
Pessier say it was present in their zoo as early as 1988, when two
specimens of White's tree frog, Litoria caerulea, which come from
Australia, were struck down.
</P>
<P>
   Lips and Green, meanwhile, have joined forces with scientists
headed by Alex Hyatt and Lee Berger of the Australian Animal Health
Laboratory in Geelong, near Melbourne, and Rick Speare of James
Cook University in Townsville, Queensland.
</P>
<P>
   The chytrid was first found in Australia in 1993 at the
Melbourne Zoo _ in the sharp-snouted day frog, Taudactylus
acutirostris, from Queensland. Again, it was initially thought to
be a protozoan.
</P>
<P>
   The AAHL team has found the fungus in 115 animals from 17
species from Panama and Australia. These range from the huge cane
toad, Bufo marinus, introduced into Australia, to the dainty
harlequin frog, Atelopus varius, from Panama. ``Endangered frogs in
high-altitude rain forest streams seem to be the most vulnerable,
but we don't know why,'' Berger says.
</P>
<P>
   The fungus did not show up in 28 amphibians from 13 species
collected in Costa Rica and Panama between 1987 and 1995,
suggesting that it has only recently become a problem. Berger has
also transmitted the disease to healthy frogs exposed in water to
skin scrapings from infected frogs. The animals died. The team's
research will be published next month in the Proceedings of the
National Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   Pessier believes the frogs and toads are suffocating because of
the fungal growth and because, in reaction to the fungus, they are
laying down extra layers of keratin in their skin. Another
possibility is that the fungus is releasing a toxin.
</P>
<P>
   It might be possible to treat captive animals with an
anti-fungal agent, but this would be difficult to do in the wild.
</P>
<P>
   ``Multidisciplinary teams of scientists need to work out exactly
what role this fungus is playing and what can be done about it,''
Pessier says. &QL;

 &HT;    DAY ONE IN CHINA: HOW THE SCRIPT WENT AWRY
 &HT;    With CHINA-CLINTON-0627.
 &HT;    By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT and MARCIA KUNSTEL 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ It was a scene so disagreeable that nobody could have
predicted it: a tough Chinese security man bellowing at two White
House valets on the tarmac outside Air Force One.
</P>
<P>
   It happened at the Xi'an airport Friday, as President Clinton
was nearing the end of a day that already had the marks of a public
relations fiasco.
</P>
<P>
   Before Air Force One reached Beijing, White House Press
Secretary Mike McCurry was accusing the Chinese security man of
mistreating the Clinton valets because ``these guys looked Asian.''
</P>
<P>
   Day One in the Middle Kingdom had been scripted by the White
House advance team as a glossy series of upbeat photo ops about
today's modern China. Apparently the idea was to give Americans the
tastiest possible appetizer Friday in advance of Saturday's
mouth-puckering images of Clinton in Tiananmen Square.
</P>
<P>
   Events started going off message when the three big
international news wires -- AP, AFP, Reuters -- began humming with
reports that three or four dissidents had been locked up in Xi'an
around the time of Clinton's arrival.
</P>
<P>
   The reports originated with a Chinese exile living in Hong Kong.
He is Lu Siqing, a workahalic 35-year-old computer programmer who
makes a sidelight of faxing reports to Western news agencies about
dissidents harassed or jailed inside China.
</P>
<P>
   With Clinton in China, all three wires moved small items Friday
morning on Lu's unconfirmed information about the Xi'an dissidents'
detention.
</P>
<P>
   The story escalated when a White House pool reporter asked
Clinton about it during the president's visit to discuss village
elections at Xiahe. That's when Clinton uttered his most newsworthy
words of Day One -- that if true, the news stories were
``disturbing.''
</P>
<P>
   This one word swelled into a sandstorm of correspondents' follow
up questions during a daily news briefing by White House officials
at Xi'an's Shangri-la Golden Flower Hotel. That was where White
House national security adviser Sandy Berger let fly with charges
that China's detention of the dissidents was ``unacceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons had finally smiled their final adieus in Xi'an and
ascended the big ramp onto Air Force One when an American radio
pool reporter heard some loud shouting on the tarmac.
</P>
<P>
   It was a Chinese security man shouting at two Filipino-American
valets on the White House staff. With Air Force One about to take
off, there wasn't time for the White House press pool to straighten
out exactly why the Chinese security man was upset.
</P>
<P>
   What was clear was that the valets were trying to load the
Clintons' garment bags onto the plane until the security man
temporarily prevented them from boarding. The contretemps seems to
have ended when a Chinese-speaking American staffer showed up and
vouched for the two valets.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Chinese security guy said the baggage was the problem,''
McCurry told reporters after Air Force One was airborne. ``Our
security people said it didn't look to them like that was the
problem. It looked to them like the problem was that those guys
looked Asian.''
</P>
<P>
   If McCurry's interpretation is accurate, it suggests that the
Chinese agent may have been afraid the president was sneaking some
wanted dissidents aboard the presidential jet. Another possibility,
of course, is that the valets were suspected of smuggling out some
of Xi'an's famous antiquities.
</P>
<P>
   What really happened may remain an oriental mystery. So far as
was known early Saturday, none of the Americans who witnessed the
fracas spoke Chinese.

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    By Colin Bessonette
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: But it isn't cola that has had caffeine added to it,
and then has been processsed again to take the caffine back out.
</P>
<P>
   Q: At the recent meeting of the Southern Baptist Convention, a
statement was adopted stating that wives should submit graciously
to their husbands, and the husbands would provide for, protect and
lead their families. How many of those voting were female?
</P>
<P>
   A: An exact breakdown isn't available. The total number of
``messengers,'' as those attending conventions are called, was
8,586. No roll call was taken at the time of the vote on the
marriage and family statement, said Art Tolston of Baptist Press in
Nashville. So it isn't known precisely how many people were in the
hall at that time, ``let alone how many were men or women,'' he
told Q&AMP;A. The vote was taken by a show of hands, and was described
as being ``overwhelming'' in favor of the statement's adoption,
Tolston added.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have dual questions dealing with the NBA. What team did
Phil Jackson, coach of the Chicago Bulls, play for in his pro
career? Also, during the Indiana Pacers series, why were the Pacers
wearing black armbands?
</P>
<P>
   A: The son of a minister, Jackson studied religion at the
University of North Dakota, where he also was a two-time
All-American. He spent 11 years with the New York Knicks, where he
was a member of the 1970 and 1973 championship teams as a backup to
center Willis Reed, and two years as an assistant coach/player with
the New Jersey Nets. The Pacers' armbands were worn in memory of
Bill Hart, longtime team employee and, most recently, its equipment
manager. Hart died of cancer April 14 at age 73.
</P>
<P>
   Q: It was announced recently that a Swiss and American venture
was planning to finance and build a full-size replica of the
Titanic. Any details?
</P>
<P>
   A: Actually there are two competing plans for a new Titanic.
White Star Line Ltd., a company set up by a consultancy firm based
on Basle, Switzerland, and Las Vegas financiers, says it wants to
build such a ship and launch it on a maiden voyage from
Southampton, England, to New York in April 2002. That would be
exactly 90 years after the original set sail. The firm has held
talks with Northern Ireland's Harland and Wolff, builders of the
original Titanic, and said in May it was hoping to sign a deal
within several months on a preplanning phase for the project. The
replica's exterior would look like the original Titanic, but it
would have modern engines, instrumentation and safety equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a company based in South Africa, RMS Titanic Shipping
Holdings, also has announced plans for a Titanic replica. It would
be built in Durban, South Africa, to the ``exact specifications''
of the original, but with high-tech engines, navigation and global
communications facilities. The vessel would make its initial voyage
Dec. 29, 1999, a date the company called ``the eve of the new
millennium.'' The South Africa company said Harland and Wolff would
be consultants on the project.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies admit that their interest in constructing a new
Titanic was fueled by the phenomenal success of the blockbuster
Oscar-winning movie.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A recent article listed 29 winners of MacArthur Foundation
``genius grants.'' I've also heard the MacArthurs mentioned
frequently as contributors to National Public Radio. Who are or
were they?
</P>
<P>
   A: John D. MacArthur (1897-1978) developed and owned Bankers
Life and Casualty Co. When he died, he was one of the three
wealthiest men in the United States and was sole owner of the
nation's largest privately held insurance company. In the 1960s,
MacArthur branched out into real estate and development. Over the
years, his holdings have included 100,000 acres in Florida,
primarily in the Palm Beach and Sarasota areas; several development
companies and shopping centers; paper and pulp companies; 19
commercial, office and apartment buildings in New York City;
several publishing enterprises; radio and TV stations; banks and 12
insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Catherine T. MacArthur (1909-81), was intimately
involved in her husband's business, starting by keeping the books.
When he bought Bankers Life and Casualty Co. of Chicago in 1935,
she created the business procedures that would be used until
tremendous growth finally made them obsolete. In the records of the
various companies, she appears almost anonymously under her maiden
name (C.T. Hyland) in the positions of corporate secretary,
director or both.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the world population now? I keep seeing and hearing
varying numbers, some as high as 100 billion.
</P>
<P>
   A: According to the U.S. Census Bureau's International Programs
Center, the total population of the world, projected to 18:28:47
GMT (2:28:47 p.m. EDT) June 16, was 5,923,383,463. They figure that
every second, five people are born and two people die, a net gain
of three people. If you have Internet access, you can keep up with
the World Population Clock at this site:
www.census.gov/cgi-bin/ipc/popclockw
</P>
<P>
   Q: A radio commentator said June 16 is ``Soweto Day,'' but
didn't explain what it was all about. Do you know?
</P>
<P>
   A: Also known as International Day of Solidarity With the
Struggling People of South Africa, Soweto Day is sponsored by the
United Nations. It commemorates the start of the uprising in the
huge South African township of Soweto in 1976, when a student
protest led to clashes with police in which hundreds of people were
killed. When it was begun, Soweto Day's aim was to protest outrage
at South Africa's apartheid policies.

an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail

</P>
<P>
   Q: I never miss a Rita Hayworth or Betty Grable movie on TV, but
I seem to have missed the announcement of a new postmaster general.
Do you have any information about this person?
</P>
<P>
   A: William J. Henderson, 50, was named the 71st postmaster
general of the United States effective May 12. Henderson is the
first postal employee to have the top U.S. Postal Service position
in 12 years. A graduate of the University of North Carolina, he
began his postal career as a management trainee in 1972. Over the
years, he has been a postmaster in Memphis and Stockton, Calif.;
field division manager/postmaster of the USPS's Greensboro, N.C.,
division; Southern Region director of employee and labor relations;
and chief marketing officer and senior vice president. Henderson
replaced Marvin Runyon, who resigned after six years to return to
the private sector.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the origin of the saying ``Here's mud in your eye!''
when toasting someone?
</P>
<P>
   A: The toast originally was made in the muddy trenches of World
War I, or in the cafes where English and American soldiers spent
their furloughs trying to forget them, according to the Facts on
File Encyclopedia of Word and Phrase Origins.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My 5-year-old grandson and I were wondering: When was the
first cartoon series shown on TV, and what was it?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Telecomics originated as a syndicated series in 1949.
Picked up by NBC and renamed The NBC Comics, it made its network
debut Sept. 18, 1950. Featured characters included Brother Goose,
Joey and Jug, Johnny and Mr. Do-Right, Kid Champion and Space
Barton. The series was canceled March 30, 1951.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Please settle a minor skirmish in my family. Are the people
who broadcast the weather onThe Weather Channel all meteorologists,
or are they simply paid announcers?
</P>
<P>
   A: Perhaps you could say they're hybrids. When The Weather
Channel first started, it used ``degreed meteorologists'' almost
exclusively, said spokeswoman Kathy Lane. Now, however, other
people also are hired. ``They have to have a passion for weather,
and be good communicators,'' she said. A lot of the people you see
have degrees in science, journalism or broadcasting, and some come
from the armed forces ``where meteorology plays a big role,'' Lane
added.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why were the ``doughboys'' of World War I called that?
</P>
<P>
   A: Although the nickname doughboy for U.S. infantrymen was
popularized in World War I, it was part of Army slang for many
years before that, according to the Morris Dictionary of Word and
Phrase Origins. Elizabeth Custer, widow of Gen. George (``Custer's
Last Stand'') Custer, explained it this way in her memoirs of the
general: ``A doughboy was a small, round doughnut. Early in the
Civil War, the term was applied to the large, globular brass
buttons on the infantry uniform, from which it passed by natural
transition to the soldiers themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: How big is Ted Turner's ranch in New Mexico? How does it
compare in size to the entire state? And how does it compare to
something most of us would be familiar with, such as the Great
Smoky Mountains National Park?
</P>
<P>
   A: Turner has several ranches in New Mexico: Vermejo, 578,000
acres; Ladder, 155,000; and Armendaris, 350,000. Total, 1,083,000
acres. The state covers 77,672,960 acres (121,364 square miles).
The Great Smoky Mountains National Park covers 520,269 acres.
Turner also owns ranches in Montana and Nebraska. The total acreage
of all eight ranches in the West, according to the New York Times,
is 1.29 million. That would be about 2,015 square miles.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The shroud of Turin is back in the news because of its last
public showing until 2000. Have any miracles ever been attributed
to it?
</P>
<P>
   A: If you mean ``miracles'' in the sense of sick or injured
people being cured by viewing or touching the shroud, which many
believe is Christ's burial cloth, Q&AMP;A found no documented evidence.
But the very fact that the shroud was saved in April 1997 from
flames that heavily damaged the 15th century San Giovanni Cathedral
in Turin, Italy, was considered miraculous by no less than Pope
John Paul II. After the fire, in which a Turin firefighter salvaged
a silver box containing the shroud, the pope was quoted as saying:
``A miracle. A holy icon venerated by so many over the centuries
has again been saved from the flames.'' The firefighter who smashed
through four layers of bulletproof glass protecting the shroud also
claimed something miraculous had happened by saying God gave him
the strength to wield his sledgehammer. The shroud _ which some
experts, using carbon dating, have declared isn't old enough to
have been woven at the time of Jesus' death _ also survived at
least two other attempts to set fire to the Turin cathedral.

   Q: Some utility companies ask for customers' Social Security
numbers when they apply for service. When I first got my Social
Security number in 1959, the card had this statement printed on it:
Not to be used for identification purposes. What's the position
now?
</P>
<P>
   A: While the Social Security Administration is aware of concerns
about the increasing uses of Social Security numbers for client
identification and recordkeeping purposes, it still warns people
not to use their Social Security card as an identification card.
And while several other government agencies are permitted by law to
use Social Security numbers _ such as banks and other financial
institutions using the numbers to report interest earned to the
Internal Revenue Service _ there's no law either authorizing or
prohibiting their use, the agency says.
</P>
<P>
   If it makes you feel better, Social Security insists that
providing numbers to private companies, government agencies or
anyone else who asks for them doesnot give them access to your
Social Security records. The privacy of an individual's records is
guaranteed, the agency says, unless disclosure to another
government agency is required by law, or the information is needed
to conduct Social Security or other government health or welfare
programs. And you always have the option of refusing to provide the
number to a business or other enterprise. However, that may mean
doing without the purchase or service for which your number was
requested.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I heard that Vice President Al Gore referred to Michael
Jordan as Michael Jackson, but I didn't see anything about it in
the papers. Is that true?
</P>
<P>
   A: The verbal air ball indeed did happen. And no, we won't
mention any similar Dan Quayle-isms. Here's how Gore's remarks went
when he was speaking at a Washington function, as reported by CNN's
``Inside Politics'':
</P>
<P>
   ``That was quite a win. I tell you, that Michael Jackson is
unbelievable. Isn't he _ just unbelievable. Three plays in 20
seconds.''
</P>
<P>
   Commentator Judy Woodruff followed a video clip of the incident
by saying, ``Well, that probably was just a slip of the tongue, but
it is doubtful that Al Gore impressed anybody, at an event
promoting the importance of fathers, with his knowledge of
basketball's greatest star. The vice president apparently confused
Michael Jordan with another M.J. known for songs, not slam dunks.''
And no word about whether Gore ever apologized to anybody about the
miscue.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I read an explanation about how coffee is decaffeinated. What
is the process for taking caffeine out of cola?
</P>
<P>
   A: There's no such thing as ``decaffeinated cola,'' said Chris
Rosenbloom, spokeswoman for the American Dietetic Association and a
nutritionist and professor at Georgia State University. When colas
(soft drinks) are first produced, they are virtually
``caffeine-free.'' Caffeine is added later ``as part of the flavor
profile,'' in the words of the National Soft Drink Association. Of
course there is such a thing as ``caffine-free'' cola for people
who wish to restrict their caffeine intake. But it isn't cola that
has had caffeine added to it, and then has been processsed again to
take the caffine back out.

   &UR; NEWS AND FEATURES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   VATICAN-LUTHERANS-NYT (Undated) _ In a decision that ends a
divisive chapter of the Reformation, the Vatican said the Catholic
Church will sign a joint declaration with the world's Lutherans
that affirms that Catholics and Lutherans share a basic
understanding of how people receive salvation. The document,
approved last week by the Lutheran World Federation, declares that
Catholics and Lutherans have common ground to overcome the issue
that split the Western Christian world nearly 500 years ago _ the
question of whether `justification' comes solely through faith in
God, as Luther held, or whether a person's good works also play a
role, as Catholics emphasized. By Gustav Niebuhr. Moved 6-25.
</P>
<P>
   PREACHER-TEACHER-NYT (New York) _ Mildred Rosario was dismissed
as a substitute public school teacher after she admitted leading
her class in prayer and asking if anyone would accept Jesus. Now
she has emerged as an unlikely cause celebre, drawing the attention
of not only religious-minded parents and clerical leaders in New
York but also House Speaker Newt Gingrich and the conservative
Rutherford Institute. By Jacques Steinberg with Macarena Hernandez.
Moved 6-25.
</P>
<P>
   DELAY-RELIGION-HNS (Washington) _ Conservative Republicans led
by House Majority Whip Tom DeLay called for the reinstatement
Thursday of a New York City substitute teacher who was fired for
allegedly sharing her Pentecostal beliefs with her students to help
them deal with the death of a classmate. By Greg McDonald. Moved
6-25.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-RELIGION-COX (Beijing) _ China's Christians must choose:
restricted legal worship or underground risks. China controls all
Christian groups by forcing them to register as social
organizations, regulating what they preach and arresting or
detaining those who cross the government-drawn line of acceptable
religious practice. Both Protestants and Catholics must be part of
China's `patriotic' religious movement, which means they cannot
align with a foreign-based church. By Marcia Kunstel and Joseph
Albright. Moved 6-24 for 6-28.
</P>

   With sidebar: CHINA-HISTBOX-COX (Beijing) _ How China's
personality for the last two millennia has been shaped by

<P>
   POPE-SUCCESSOR-NYT (Vienna) _ As the 78-year-old pope's health
declines, Vatican watchers cannot resist studying the roster of
cardinals for the few who could be tapped as his successor. A name
often mentioned is that of Cardinal Christoph Schoenborn, the
53-year-old leader of the deeply divided church in Austria. By
Alessandra Stanley. Moved 6-23.
</P>
<P>
   POLAND-JEWISH-CEMETERY-NYT (Kalisz, Poland) _ A well-worn school
playground, where hard sports have left more dirt than grass but
that was once the site of a venerated Jewish cemetery, has prompted
a bitter dispute between Jewish organizations and the Polish
authorities. Jewish leaders say they that a distinguished
17th-century rabbi, Abraham Abele Gombiner, is buried beneath the
soccer field. They say it is an affront to the Jewish religion that
the body of such an important figure, whose legal works and
biblical commentaries are still in use, should be left in such a
sacrilegious way. By Jane Perlez. Moved 6-23. WITH GRAPHIC MAP.
</P>
<P>
   NY-SCHOOLS-RELIGION-NYT (New York) _ A year after the U.S.
Supreme Court ruled that public school teachers in New York City

grounds, school and union officials say there have been no
complaints from those teachers. By Jacques Steinberg. Moved 6-21.
</P>
<P>
   PRESBY-GUNS-NYT (Undated) Striking an unusally personal note in
the national debate on gun control, the top policy-making body of
the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) has passed a resolution calling on
the denomination's 2.6 million members to `work toward removing
handguns and assault weapons' from their homes and communities.
Presbyterian officials and other church leaders said the assembly's
resolution takes a new tack in asking directly for individual
action by church members, rather than seeking governmental
legislation. By Gustav Niebuhr. Moved 6-19.
</P>
<P>
   BISHOPS-SEX-VIOLENCE-NYT (Undated) _ U.S. Roman Catholic bishops
issued an appeal Friday to the entertainment industry and the
government to reduce the public portrayal of sex and excessive
violence. Saying that pornography and images of violence `gravely
harm the moral and psychological health' of society, the bishops
offered a mixture of criticism and encouragement, specifically
warning about the use of the Internet to distribute obscenity and
prejudice, while also declaring that parents have more influence
over their children than they may realize. By Gustav Niebuhr. Moved
6-19.
</P>
<P>
   AUSTRIA-POPE-NYT (Vienna) _ Seeking to restore discipline to
Austria's deeply divided Roman Catholic Church, Pope John Paul II
instructed the country's bishops Sunday to stop their public
bickering. Without unity, the pope warned, `the teachings of Christ
dissolve into many individual voices. In the place of harmony comes
noisy confusion.' By Alessandra Stanley. Moved 6-21.
</P>
<P>
   POPE-AUSTRIA-NYT (Salzburg) _ Pope John Paul II, on a visit to
Austria, appeals to Austrians not to allow the sex scandal
involving the former archbishop to Vienna to turn them away from
the church. By Alessandra Stanley. Moved 6-19.
</P>
<P>
   POPE-AUSTRIA-NYT (Vienna) _ Speaking to a group of Austrian

   VATICAN-LUTHERANS-NYT (Undated) _ In a decision that ends a
divisive chapter of the Reformation, the Vatican said the Catholic
Church will sign a joint declaration with the world's Lutherans
that affirms that Catholics and Lutherans share a basic
understanding of how people receive salvation. The document,
approved last week by the Lutheran World Federation, declares that
Catholics and Lutherans have common ground to overcome the issue
that split the Western Christian world nearly 500 years ago _ the
question of whether `justification' comes solely through faith in
God, as Luther held, or whether a person's good works also play a
role, as Catholics emphasized. By Gustav Niebuhr. Moved 6-25.
</P>
<P>
   PREACHER-TEACHER-NYT (New York) _ Mildred Rosario was dismissed
as a substitute public school teacher after she admitted leading
her class in prayer and asking if anyone would accept Jesus. Now
she has emerged as an unlikely cause celebre, drawing the attention
of not only religious-minded parents and clerical leaders in New
York but also House Speaker Newt Gingrich and the conservative
Rutherford Institute. By Jacques Steinberg with Macarena Hernandez.
Moved 6-25.
</P>
<P>
   DELAY-RELIGION-HNS (Washington) _ Conservative Republicans led
by House Majority Whip Tom DeLay called for the reinstatement
Thursday of a New York City substitute teacher who was fired for
allegedly sharing her Pentecostal beliefs with her students to help
them deal with the death of a classmate. By Greg McDonald. Moved
6-25.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-RELIGION-COX (Beijing) _ China's Christians must choose:
restricted legal worship or underground risks. China controls all
Christian groups by forcing them to register as social
organizations, regulating what they preach and arresting or
detaining those who cross the government-drawn line of acceptable
religious practice. Both Protestants and Catholics must be part of
China's `patriotic' religious movement, which means they cannot
align with a foreign-based church. By Marcia Kunstel and Joseph
Albright. Moved 6-24 for 6-28.

<P>
   POPE-SUCCESSOR-NYT (Vienna) _ As the 78-year-old pope's health
declines, Vatican watchers cannot resist studying the roster of
cardinals for the few who could be tapped as his successor. A name
often mentioned is that of Cardinal Christoph Schoenborn, the
53-year-old leader of the deeply divided church in Austria. By
Alessandra Stanley. Moved 6-23.
</P>
<P>
   POLAND-JEWISH-CEMETERY-NYT (Kalisz, Poland) _ A well-worn school
playground, where hard sports have left more dirt than grass but
that was once the site of a venerated Jewish cemetery, has prompted
a bitter dispute between Jewish organizations and the Polish
authorities. Jewish leaders say they that a distinguished
17th-century rabbi, Abraham Abele Gombiner, is buried beneath the
soccer field. They say it is an affront to the Jewish religion that
the body of such an important figure, whose legal works and
biblical commentaries are still in use, should be left in such a
sacrilegious way. By Jane Perlez. Moved 6-23. WITH GRAPHIC MAP.

<P>
   NY-SCHOOLS-RELIGION-NYT (New York) _ A year after the U.S.
Supreme Court ruled that public school teachers in New York City
could hold remedial and other supplementary classes inside
religious schools, rather than in oversize vans off the school
grounds, school and union officials say there have been no
complaints from those teachers. By Jacques Steinberg. Moved 6-21.

<P>
   PRESBY-GUNS-NYT (Undated) Striking an unusally personal note in
the national debate on gun control, the top policy-making body of
the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) has passed a resolution calling on
the denomination's 2.6 million members to `work toward removing
handguns and assault weapons' from their homes and communities.
Presbyterian officials and other church leaders said the assembly's
resolution takes a new tack in asking directly for individual
action by church members, rather than seeking governmental
legislation. By Gustav Niebuhr. Moved 6-19.
</P>
<P>
   BISHOPS-SEX-VIOLENCE-NYT (Undated) _ U.S. Roman Catholic bishops
issued an appeal Friday to the entertainment industry and the
government to reduce the public portrayal of sex and excessive
violence. Saying that pornography and images of violence `gravely
harm the moral and psychological health' of society, the bishops
offered a mixture of criticism and encouragement, specifically
warning about the use of the Internet to distribute obscenity and
prejudice, while also declaring that parents have more influence
over their children than they may realize. By Gustav Niebuhr. Moved
6-19.
</P>
<P>
   AUSTRIA-POPE-NYT (Vienna) _ Seeking to restore discipline to
Austria's deeply divided Roman Catholic Church, Pope John Paul II
instructed the country's bishops Sunday to stop their public
bickering. Without unity, the pope warned, `the teachings of Christ
dissolve into many individual voices. In the place of harmony comes
noisy confusion.' By Alessandra Stanley. Moved 6-21.

   The strawberries are overpriced, and the British players are
destined always to be gallant losers. But that's where the truth
ends as far as Wimbledon cliches are concerned, say Dutch academics
who have analyzed scoring patterns from four successive years' play
at the world's most prestigious tennis tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Jan Magnus and Franc Klaassen, experts in economic statistical
analysis at Tilburg University, have analyzed nearly 90,000 points
from 481 matches played at Wimbledon between 1992 and 1995. Their
work has given the truisms of tennis a real pounding, and should
give the television pundits covering this year's tournament pause
for thought.
</P>
<P>
   Magnus and Klaassen have found that players are not more likely
to fluff a point immediately after serving a double fault. And
though new balls may be faster, they don't offer the server a clear
advantage. Nor is it true that the player who serves first is more
likely to win a set.
</P>
<P>
   ``The inspiration came from my irritation at the outpourings of
the so-called experts on TV,'' says Magnus, a keen fan and player
as well as a statistician.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most frequently expressed maxims says players are
more likely to lose a service game straight after breaking an
opponent's serve _ perhaps because they relax a little or rest on
their laurels after breaking. The figures dispel this idea. If
anything, players are slightly more likely to hold their own
service game after breaking their opponent.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the game following a break, it isn't true that the winner
takes it a bit easier and the loser tries a bit harder. Apparently
what happens is just the opposite,'' Magnus says.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of popular conceptions, at least, are backed by the new
analysis. Champions, the Dutch researchers say, seem to have a
winning mentality. Most noticeably, the better a player is, as
measured by world ranking, the less affected he or she is by what's
happened while playing the previous point. And it seems that real
champions play their best tennis at the most crucial points in a
match.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me this is the most interesting finding,'' Magnus says.
``The commentators will say that's obvious and that it's something
they've said all along _ but then most things they've been saying
haven't turned out be true.''
</P>
<P>
   Magnus says he is happy to offer his statistical expertise to
players who ask for it. One world-ranked Dutch player approached
him a couple of years ago for help. His analysis showed that she
was more likely to win a point if she did not serve at full speed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told her to hit her first serve a little less hard,'' he
says. ``But she didn't like it. She said she had to listen to her
coach instead.'' &QL;

AGELESS WILLIE BROWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARTIN F. NOLAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO -- John Updike and Willie L. Brown Jr., who live
and work three time zones apart, share the same fountain-of-youth
formula. Updike's curmudgeonly character Bech has a new female
companion in a New Yorker short story: ``He was 74, but they worked
with that. Seventy-four plus 26 was 100; divided by two that was
50, the prime of life.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown's formula is also mathematical and fictional. The mayor of
San Francisco is what society writers called ``a man about town.''
``The rule of 100,'' which he learned in Sacramento from
gallivanting colleagues in the Legislature, specified of companions
that ``if our age and their age equals 100, they are too old.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor, now 64, still gets around and still seems to be
having a good time. To those who wonder how he gets around the rule
of 100, he replies, ``I lie a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Updike's Bech had ``planted a flickering wedge of doubt beneath
the threshold of consciousness and brought down a media-savvy
smart-ass.'' Such a plan might succeed in New Yorker fiction but
not in San Franciscan reality. Brown is deadly earnest when talking
about the politics of his state or the economics of his city. But
even in the daytime, a touch of mischief flavors his conversation.
</P>
<P>
   On the political future of California:
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the state is becoming increasingly centrist. I don't
think it's becoming more liberal, and I don't think it's becoming
more conservative. The advent of racial minorities participating in
greater numbers at the ballot box is offsetting the enormous
influence that the conservative majority has had in this state by
disproportionate voting. But it's not enough to move it to the
liberal side. It's simply enough to stop the slide toward
right-wingism.''
</P>
<P>
   On the 1998 gubernatorial election between Republican Dan
Lungren, whom Brown calls ``formidable,'' and Democrat Gray Davis,
whom Brown endorsed early:
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, Gray has always had gray hair. When he was a kid, he
had gray hair. He's identical, same as he was years ago, physically
and otherwise. ... Lungren has transformed himself into this
charming, delightful, self-effacing, self-deprecating candidate. I
do believe that the public forgets the original Dan Lungren, and
the public must know that this new Dan Lungren is not a genetic
transformation. It is a cosmetic adjustment. ... It's going to be a
very close gubernatorial election. But Gray Davis is going to win
it.''
</P>
<P>
   On his city 10 years from now, after he is term-limited out of
office:
</P>
<P>
   ``San Francisco by the year 2008 will have all of the public
improvements that were initiated now totally and completely
functional. The 26 gates at the international airport will be
there. The new runway will be virtually finished. ... In Mission
Bay there will be 7,200 new living units as well as 5 million
square feet of biotech, retail and multimedia space. ... Also, by
then we will have upgraded the quality of public transportation out
of pure necessity. This city by then will be sparkling. We will
have no school older than about 10 years, because to renew our
schools, we pass bond issue after bond issue. Our libraries will
all have been renewed by then. ... The then-mayor will be a
caretaker of a municipal structure that will rival the best parts
of Paris in terms of its physical appearance.''
</P>
<P>
   Paris? That's ambitious, and there's also something Cartesian in
the way Willie Brown thinks, the way he follows up a faux pas with
an initiative, the way his outspokenness balances his
accomplishments:
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't start out to make mistakes. When I get in trouble by
virtue of my conduct, it usually is of the same proportion as my
successes.''
</P>
<P>
   On his own reelection contest in 1999:
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure somebody will run. The more the merrier, maybe nine.
I want at least a baseball team.''
</P>
<P>
   The opposing team's lineup card is currently blank.

   Windows 98, the eagerly awaited upgrade for the Windows 95
operating system, went on sale this week. But Windows 95 users who
have tried out a wide variety of software and hardware over the
past few years risk system crashes when they install the upgrade.
These ``power users'' may find their PCs become trapped in a
no-man's-land where neither Windows 95 nor Windows 98 works.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 300 million PCs in use today worldwide, 130 million run
Windows 95. The owners of these machines can now upgrade to Windows
98, which they buy on a CD-ROM. The software takes around an hour
to install. Before replacing Windows 95, it checks whether the
hardware and software already on the machine are compatible with
the new system. But this check may not identify one key problem.
</P>
<P>
   Windows 95 relies on a ``registry'' _ an electronic index that
is automatically updated as the user adds or removes programs or
hardware. Windows 98 has a similar registry. The upgrade software
builds this by converting the records stored by Windows 95.
</P>
<P>
   But if the registry is large and complex, it may contain
inaccurate entries that the preupgrade check does not recognize.
Windows 98 then cannot build its new registry and so tries to run a
``plug-and-play'' check, in which it searches for all installed
hardware and software on the PC.
</P>
<P>
   This can take many minutes and can cause the PC to crash. It is
then unusable until all its software is reloaded from scratch onto
another part of the hard disc. Even then, Windows 98 cannot use
previously stored data and settings.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesperson from Microsoft's technical support team says it
has heard of the problem from power users who have installed test
versions of Windows 98. However, a spokeswoman says the company has
no plans to issue any special warnings. ``We expect consumers to
check that their PCs can run new software before using it,'' she
says.
</P>
<P>
   David Weeks, product marketing manager for Windows in Britain,
says that users who experience problems can get free technical help
from Microsoft's support line for 90 days after they first hit
trouble. &QL;

INFINITI DOES A LITTLE BETTER WITH LATEST G20 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN R. WHITE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Infiniti showed off its latest generation entry-level luxury car
this week, choosing the grandeur of Boston's Museum of
Transportation as the setting for its newest jewel, the 1999 G20.
The G20 has, in past incarnations, been among this columnist's
least favorite cars. That may change.
</P>
<P>
   For openers, the new G20 has a real back seat, a bench that will
accommodate real people with real knees who wish to sit upright.
We're talking knee room with the front seat fully extended to the
rear, not what you might get if the driver were a midget. In
keeping with the added rear room is added rear entry room, a larger
door opening.
</P>
<P>
   I dwell on the rear accommodation because it was the back of the
G20 that most distressed in previous editions. The cramped rear, in
concert with a stiff suspension _ in the rear, bordering on vicious
one year _ that made one wonder why anyone would part with luxury
money for that very un-luxury cabin.
</P>
<P>
   The new G20 suspension is still an unknown on the road, at least
unknown to me, but Nissan, the mother company to Infiniti, claims
great strides forward. It is obvious that great strides have been
undertaken in several departments.
</P>
<P>
   The new G20 looks like an Infiniti for a change instead of an
overweight Sentra. There is a grace to the shape, a logic to the
interior layout, and styling allure front and rear. The current
edition is based upon a European model, the Primera, Infiniti says,
and is available in standard and touring variants. A
140-horsepower, 2.0-liter, 16-valve 4-cylinder supplies the power
delivering it through either a 5-speed, manual gearbox or a
4-speed, electronically controlled, automatic transaxle. The new
model comes with side air bags for safety and a Bose sound system
for your soul.
</P>
<P>
   Infiniti is pinning high hopes on the front-drive G20, aiming
for US sales of 18,000 units, a considerable leap over the
13,000-plus sales last achieved by G20 and somewhat higher than the
peak annual sales total of 17,300-plus. It's aimed at the youthful
driver, Infiniti says, and it seemed to awaken the youth in more
than one of us among the New England Motor Press Association on
hand for the unveiling. A full-scale road test is in the works.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   General Motors continues to carom away from common sense. Since
last we left GM, the company, having convinced a corps of Wall
Street analysts that profits were continuing up and boosted
short-term sales results with coupons and incentives, has provoked
a crippling strike, blamed it on the employees, announced drastic
cash conservation programs, initiated moves to create another layer
of management, signed a deal to build trucks and sport/utilities in
China, intimated to its employees that it is ``losing $50 million a
year,'' and announced a Cadillac 2-seat roadster.
</P>
<P>
   GM, after lengthy bickering in Flint, moved dies out of a
stamping plant over a weekend, thus fueling union suspicions that
the company intended to move the Flint operation to Mexico, thus
provoking a walkout. The Flint shutdown was the first in a chain of
dominoes that have virtually crippled GM production and threatened
new-model introductions.
</P>
<P>
   True to form, while demanding new work rules and blue-collar
reductions, the General has come up with still another
management-fattener: GM will promote its brand managers to
positions of authority heretofore reserved for the division
managers and move division managers aside _ at least that's the
picture offered in the trade press. ``Brand management'' is the
buzzword these days, so it was only a matter of time until GM's
recruits from the ranks of diapers and cookies be elevated. This,
you may recall, is a company that while nearly halving its market
share and reducing its blue-collar work force, has added another
division _ read that as added management.
</P>
<P>
   While denying any intention to move Flint work to Mexico, GM has
signed an agreement with the world's lowest-wage country, China, to
build light trucks and SUVs _ that's in addition to the agreement
to build Buick Regals there, a car for which every Chinese over 16
lusts, right?
</P>
<P>
   I do recall some years back when GM's Bob Stempel, briefly the
CEO after Roger Smith retired, denied that Buick production had
been moved to Mexico, then explained that all 50,000 Mexican-built
A-body cars (which he had just told me weren't made in Mexico) were
bought by Mexicans. Yes, an economy that at the time barely
supported 400,000 car sales annually suddenly snapped up an
additional 50,000 new cars. Strangely, though, everybody else in
that Washington, D.C., room believed him!
</P>
<P>
   If you dial into the GM propaganda line _ 800-546-0709 _ you can
hear the GM litany for yourself and learn how the company is
instigating unprecedented ``cold shutdowns'' to avoid utility bills
in idle plants, is losing $50 million a year (presumably at Flint),
is in a crisis mode to conserve cash. And it's all the union's
fault. I hope those analysts spin that dial.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Cadillac 2-seater is to get a Northstar V-8
engine, be heavier and shorter than a Corvette, be shown ``with
production intent'' at the Paris auto show, and be a competitor for
such as Mercedes _ assuming GM doesn't melt down first. Maybe they
could call it Allante. Remember that Cadillac 2-seater? It took the
world by yawn and was killed as soon as GM got it right. General,
if you would survive, it is time to start trimming management,
jettison a few excess divisions, and stop beating up on the labor
force. Maybe if you listened more to the men and women who build
the cars instead of the accountants who cheapen them, the market
slide might slow down. Or maybe even turn around. It worked for
Ford.

THIS SONG OF THE OPEN ROAD IS A DIESEL VOLUNTARY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)  
 (For release Sunday, June 28 1998)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

   What does an automotive columnist who drives constantly for a
living do on vacation?
</P>
<P>
   A) Lock the garage and hide.
</P>
<P>
   B) Pitch a tent on an uninhabited island.
</P>
<P>
   C) Enter a couple of stock car races.
</P>
<P>
   D) Become a cross-country truck driver.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
---- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The answer to the above came in a telephone call from the museum
director.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've decided to take the car to Colorado after all.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How will you get it there?''
</P>
<P>
   ``With our new trailer, of course.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Pulled by ...?''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Dodge diesel that Chrysler lent us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I understand that, but pulled by who? Who's driving?''
</P>
<P>
   A silent pause ensues, followed by: ``Well ... I'm flying out.
... Expectant pause.
</P>
<P>
   Which is how D) became the answer to the original question.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
---- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The car to be taken is a 1910 Model 70 Stanley Steamer owned by
the Stanley Museum, Kingfield, Maine _ the museum is the ``us'' to
whom Chrysler has given the use of a truck for the summer. The
destination is the new branch of the Stanley Museum at the Stanley
Hotel in Estes Park, Colo. The reason the Model 70 is being shipped
there is not to add to the artifacts on display but to participate
in a ``steam tour'' organized to celebrate the dedication of the
new branch museum. The artifact being preserved in this case is the
steam automotive technology rather than the steam car itself.
</P>
<P>
   You see, in 1909, F.O. Stamley, twin of F.E. who invented the
Stanley car (and a lot of other stuff), having found the Colorado
mountain clime conducive to restoring his health, built this
massive hotel _ and most of the rest of what made Estes Park tick:
bank, power company, clinic, roads, etc. That, in a nutshell, is
why there is a branch of a Maine museum in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   The ``who'' of all this, you realize, is the columnist who,
equipped with a jar of peanut butter, a half-gallon of lemonade, a
loaf of bread, a kitchen knife, a blanket, a pillow, and an AAA
Road Atlas, set forth in a Dodge Ram diesel behemoth towing an
enclosed trailer, destination Estes Park some 2,400 give-or-take
miles distant. This is what becomes of being a museum
``volunteer.'' I had always wanted a long run in a diesel Dodge; I
had always wanted a cross-country road trip _ but not necessarily
together and not this badly.
</P>
<P>
   The truck is a beauty, a big red Dodge Ram 2500 with a 24-valve
Cummins diesel throbbing under the hood. The beauty, however, has
been specced (pronounced specked, meaning ordered with specific
equipment) by a teenager. The museum requested an expanded cab
model; this is a regular cab _ my gear is going into the trailer.
Museum asked for 2WD model with automatic; Big Red is 4WD with a
5-speed manual. The 16-inch chrome wheels look puny, out of place
on this monster _ but, it has a CD player.
</P>
<P>
   Day One: The truck has been prepared with auxiliary brake
control for the 22-foot-long-only-God-knows-how-tall Haulmark
trailer and said trailer loaded with steamer, tools, spare parts,
tires, pilot fuel, etc., by the heavy-lifting volunteers of the
Maine museum. Glenn Byron briefs me on the operation of the brake
auxiliary.
</P>
<P>
   Some 15 seconds into the trip, I realize that the dual power
mirrors on this truck, though large indeed, are useless for seeing
around a trailer since they don't extend far enough. This becomes
an acute consideration when I miss a turn off Maine's Route 4 and
find myself on a road to nowhere with no option for reversing
direction other than to pull into a driveway and back out.
</P>
<P>
   I pick the wrong driveway, soon find myself sliding toward A) an
embankment and B) a car as the back wheels slip on loose gravel.
Suddenly, I am extremely grateful for the 4WD as I slip the
transfer case into the 4WD-low range mode. The front wheels grab,
the Ram inches the trailer rerarward, bending it toward the highway
_ a woman appears in the window of the house that goes with the
driveway. I smile broadly, wave as if I knew her. That trailer is a
22-foot billboard for the Stanley Museum; I hope she's friendly and
has a sense of humor. She smiles. I'm on the road again. That
evening, I pull into my own driveway; I have covered a mere 151.6
miles. Four days hence, I must be in Estes Park.
</P>
<P>
   Day Two: Before going anywhere, I start hunting bigger mirrors.
A Dodge dealer can supply extended mirrors suitable for a trailer,
but that sacrifices the power option for manual operation _ plus
they cost around $180, and it will take a day or two to get them. I
opt to hit the road with a couple of add-ons from U-Haul attached
by an ingenious clamp that's mainly heavy rubber straps _ less than
$25. Not perfect, but they add that extra measure of visibility and
safety.
</P>
<P>
   I decide to head west on Interstate 90, a well patrolled toll
road through Massachusetts and New York, rather than head through
Pennsylvania for Interstate 80. In Ohio, I'll take I-71 southwest
to I-70 west toward Denver. Compared to the museum's old trailer,
the Trailer from Hell, the new double-axle Haulmark is a thing of
beauty and a joy on the road. Relativelty speaking. There isn't
much joy as the wind picks up blowing broadside.
</P>
<P>
   The Ram has extra sound-deadening to muffle the diesel rattle
and rumble; you might as well be trying to muffle a rock concert.
But, when you settle into the 2,000 rpm groove and coast along in
overdrive at 65, that rumbly rattle is a comfort. The seat in this
thing is very good, offering good back support, thigh comfort. I
stop now and then to stretch, to refill the 34-gallon fuel tank, to
take care of other ncessities of the road. At a rest stop near
Rochester, N.Y., I decide I've about had enough for the day, find a
quiet spot to park the rig, clear the bench seat, break out the
blanket and pillow. There is almost room enough to stretch out full
length. Almost. Still it is comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   It has been a 447-mile day. Only 598.7 miles of this trip have
been accomplished leaving a long road ahead. It will prove to be an
interesting road. You're welcome to ride along again in next week's
column.

   Two Saturdays ago, like spring shad, Arcadia, the 14-year old
American restaurant at 21 E. 62nd St. slipped away and disappeared.
Executive chef and co-owner Anne Rosenzweig closed the restaurant
after unarcadian negotiations with her landlord for a new lease
failed.
</P>
<P>
   The urbane little dining room, with its pastoral mural of the
four seasons by Paul Davis, had been a retreat and a refuge for its
well-heeled neighborhood and its well-heeled clientele, including
many fashion folks, since its opening in 1984. It established Ms.
Rosenzweig as a culinary star.
</P>
<P>
   But to regular customers, of whom there were many, Arcadia was a
home and Ms. Rosenzweig and her staff were family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm heartbroken; I just sort of depended on it,'' said
Geoffrey Beene, the fashion designer, who ate there once a week.
``It had the most wonderful atmosphere _ hidden away, fancy but not
fancy, which is hard to attain in New York. I love restaurants like
that; they're becoming fewer and fewer.''
</P>
<P>
   Paige Rense, the editor in chief of Architectural Digest, ate at
Arcadia three times a week. ``It was my neighborhood hangout,'' she
said. ``I ran into people I knew _ it was like a club. I could
never quite figure out why the room was successful. But it was very
simple. The banquettes faced each other. You always had the feeling
that you knew who was there, but it wasn't `living theater.'''
</P>
<P>
   William Lauder, whose family frequented Arcadia, said: ``It made
me think of my dining room in my own country house. I'll miss it
very much.''
</P>
<P>
   Fifty percent of reservations in the restaurant's final week
were people trying to squeeze themselves in before the close. Not
all were regulars. One couple, arriving on the last night, June 20,
had never been before; in front of Arcadia, they asked themselves
whether they had found it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this it?'' he asked her, as though the open french doors
and casual candlelight and quiet sidewalk scene couldn't be the
institution they had come looking for.
</P>
<P>
   After a terrific thunderstorm, which cracked the sky like a
whip, Saturday became a beautiful evening, the kind of evening that
Arcadia was famous for: effort that resulted in ease. Chefs don't
cry; they sweat. From the five tables set outside, under Arcadia's
awning, 8 o'clock was as blue as the water that fresh fish come
from. The restaurant's air-conditioning system had quit the day
before. Sean Stevens, the maitre d'hotel, seated only the front
four tables by the windows and the tables outside. The muraled
dining room was empty, as though it had already passed into memory.
</P>
<P>
   The largest table was regulars, Joan and David Helpern, of Joan
&AMP; David shoes, with their guests Eleanor Lambert, the arbiter of
best-dressed, and Ms. Lambert's son and daughter-in-law, visiting
from San Francisco. The Helperns had come three nights running
since learning that the restaurant was closing. Ms. Helpern and Ms.
Lambert sat outside with Ms. Rosenzweig before leaving, showing the
interest and pride of women with a successful daughter. Ms.
Rosenzweig shared her recipe for vinaigrette, then made them leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before I get into trouble with their families,'' she said,
protectively.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sad to see it go,'' said Ms. Lambert, walking in her
silver Belgian evening slippers beside Ms. Rosenzweig in her red
chef's clogs, toward the long black Lincoln Town Car. ``Because it
was a perfect restaurant. It was a small restaurant run like a very
big one.''
</P>
<P>
   Diminutive and shy despite her professional stature, it is hard
not equate Ms. Rosenzweig with Arcadia. Faced with a lease demand
for a tripled rent, Arcadia's failure to survive has saddened her.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, there's a certain gentleness here that's reflective of
that time when we opened,'' she said, ``that I don't feel now. It's
harsher. I don't know that I would try to open something like
Arcadia today.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rosenzweig wished the last table departing a happy birthday.
``Good luck,'' they called. Then, like a captain going down with
the ship, she took her place behind Arcadia's bar and made
Cosmopolitans for the staff.
</P>
<P>
   The busboys hustled the last pail of garbage, as if in a
three-legged sack race, through the crowd to the street. A cheer
went up for the ``last parade.''
</P>
<P>
   Bartender Patrick Donovan pretended to answer the telephone from
which Stevens took Arcadia's reservations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Table for two?'' he asked. ``No problem. I have a lovely
corner table for you,'' he said. ``See you on Monday.''

SHASTA DAISIES: IDEAL TENANTS FOR GARDEN VACANCIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, June 28)  
 (bl)  
 By CASS PETERSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
 &HT;    It is said that Luther Burbank, the horticulturist and plant
breeder, made 65,000 unsuccessful crosses between berry varieties
before finding the one that produced a white blackberry. Except for
the inherent value to botanical science, I'm not sure it was worth
the trouble.
 &HT;    But there is a Burbank creation worth whatever effort it took to
achieve: the Shasta daisy.
 &HT;    Shasta daisies are the glue that holds a summer perennial garden
together. Tall varieties provide a tranquil backdrop to the intense
blue of delphiniums; dwarf varieties temper the fiery scarlet of
Maltese cross.
 &HT;    I plant them in clumps or drifts wherever the garden has a
vacancy. All have sturdy dark-green foliage and flowers with
glistening white petals and yellow centers. Shasta daisies are as
classic as a Greek column, as classy as pearl earrings. They look
good with everything.
 &HT;    Although taxonomists have changed the genus to Leucanthemum,
Shasta daisies are often listed as Chrysanthemum x superbum,
sometimes C. maximum. Technically, C. maximum is one of the species
Burbank used to create the Shasta about a hundred years ago, along
with the Portuguese daisy (C. lacustre), the Nippon daisy (C.
nipponicum) and several other daisy species. How he did it and what
species he used are not known. Burbank wasn't much for keeping
detailed notes.
 &HT;    But his colleagues in the plant-breeding business, knowing a
good thing when they saw it, have continued developing Shasta
daisies.
 &HT;    Early varieties tended to be tall _ at least three feet at
maturity _ and bloomed for several weeks in June. Now there are
compact varieties, some barely a foot tall, double-flowered as well
as single-flowered types, and a range of bloom time broad enough to
have Shasta daisies in flower from late spring into autumn.
 &HT;    For the cutting garden, I like a tall variety, like Polaris,
Alaska or Diener's Double. These varieties will top three feet in a
sunny site, and in partial shade can grow to four feet or more
without developing the weak stems that plague sun-loving flowers
grown in shady areas.
 &HT;    Polaris has the largest flowers, as much as seven inches across.
Alaska is a profuse bloomer, but with smaller flowers, three inches
across. Diener's Double's five-inch blooms are not so plentiful,
but they are double-flowered, meaning that two or more layers of
petals circle the center of each bloom.
 &HT;    Slightly shorter, but still fine for cutting, are Northern
Lights, Snow Bouquet, Summer Snowball, Exhibition and Switzerland,
which grow 24 to 30 inches tall. Northern Lights, Snow Bouquet and
Switzerland are single-flowered; Exhibition and Summer Snowball,
double-flowered.
 &HT;    On the petite side are the dwarf Snow Lady (a 1988 All-America
Selection), which stays a neat 10 to 12 inches tall, and Silver
Princess, 15 inches. Both are single-flowered.
 &HT;    Dwarf varieties tend to flower earliest _ late May in my
south-central Pennsylvania garden. Taller varieties bloom well into
July. All Shasta daisies will bloom again in the autumn if the
plants are cut back after their main flush of flowers is spent.
Alaska is especially long-blooming, producing flowers wildly in
June and sporadically until hard frost.
 &HT;    Some Shasta daisies, especially the doubles, do not reliably
come true from seed and are usually vegetatively propagated. To try
Exhibition, Summer Snowball or Switzerland, seek a plant at a
garden center.
 &HT;    But the others are easy to start from seed, which may be sown
now to produce plants large enough to set into the garden this fall
for flowers next year. Sow the seed thinly in a seedling flat; do
not cover it. Shasta daisies need light to germinate.
 &HT;    When the seedlings are large enough to handle, transfer them to
individual pots and let them grow until they are large enough to
plant in the garden. If the seedlings don't seem large enough by
mid-September, overwinter them in their pots in a cold frame or
sheltered area, and plant them out in early spring.
 &HT;    You may also start Shasta daisies from seed in the early spring.
The young plants will produce a few flowers their first year.
 &HT;    Although Shasta daisies are perennial, and hardy well into New
England, I like to grow the cutting varieties as biennials. I plant
daisies with biennials such as cornflower and Canterbury Bells, cut
the flowers the following year, and then replace the plants with
fresh ones.
 &HT;    The reason is that Shasta daisies, especially the tall ones,
need frequent dividing. The plant loses vigor in the center, even
though the outside rim is healthy. Every second or third year, in
the spring, you will need to dig up the plant and separate the
weakened center from the strong outside growth. The roots separate
easily, and I don't mind performing this chore in the perennial
garden planted for show. Vegetatively propagated varieties must be
divided, of course, since their seeds may not produce the desired
plant.
 &HT;    But I grow many daisies in the cutting garden, which is more of
a workhorse garden than an ornamental one. The seed is inexpensive,
and it's easier to start with fresh plants.
 &HT;    Besides, starting Shasta daisies every year means that I'll have
plenty of plants to use for filling any vacancies in the garden.
Burbank, no doubt, would approve.
 &HT;

 &HT;    THIS WEEK: A TIME TO PRUNE AND IMPROVE DRAINAGE
 &HT;    By PATRICIA JONAS
 &HT;    c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Roots of young rhododendrons may suffocate in waterlogged soil
and be susceptible to Phytopthora wilt, an overall wilting
beginning with new growth. If drainage is improved, the plant will
fight this fungal disease. If it succumbs, remove and destroy it;
do not plant another rhododendron (or azalea) in the same spot.
</P>
<P>
   Although pruning of most vines was best done in early spring,
restrict growth and limit size by selectively pruning vigorous
vines like ivy (Hedera species), trumpet creeper (Campsis radicans)
and honeysuckle (Lonicera sempervirens).
</P>
<P>
   Before planting a perennial vine, consider that some, like
Japanese honeysuckle (Lonicera japonica) and porcelain berry
(Ampelopsis brevipedunculata), are noxious weeds, but are still
sold in many garden centers. Some are serious problems locally,
like English ivy (Hedera helix) in California. Check with your
local Cooperative Extension Service.

   Next month video pictures and high-speed data will be sent
through the murky depths of the North Sea _ using sound waves
instead of cables.
</P>
<P>
   The system, inspired by dolphins and the Internet, has been
developed by researchers from Newcastle University to allow
remotely operated undersea craft to inspect and maintain oil rigs.
It could also be used to hunt for shipwrecks or mines, or prospect
for new oil and gas fields. It uses the frequency band preferred by
dolphins to transmit data coded in much the same way as the modems
that squeeze extra data capacity out of phone lines.
</P>
<P>
   Only very low-frequency radio waves can travel through water,
and their long wavelength limits data capacity to a few bits of
digital information per second. This is the method used by nuclear
submarines, which may spend many months submerged. Blue-green
lasers can penetrate 100 meters of clear water, but in the murky
waters of the North Sea this falls to a few meters.
</P>
<P>
   So far, animals have done better than humans at communicating in
water. Whales keep in touch over very long distances using
low-frequency sound waves, while dolphins use higher-frequency
sounds. Attempts to use sound waves to carry digital data have
failed, however, because such waves are easily corrupted by random
reflections from the seafloor, surface waves or underwater objects.
These make the signal power fluctuate, randomly adding or removing
data bits.
</P>
<P>
   But after eight years, researchers at the Department of
Electrical and Electronic Engineering at Newcastle University claim
it can now send data through several kilometers of seawater at up
to 16 kilobits per second. ``We believe this is 10 times the rate
our competitors can achieve,'' says Oliver Hinton, the project
leader.
</P>
<P>
   Previous attempts to make this kind of technology work have used
ultrasound. Such high frequencies are directional, so the
transmitter and receiver must be kept in alignment, which is
difficult when the underwater vehicle and the boat on the surface
are out in the open sea. The Doppler shift, caused by the relative
movement of the two craft, corrupts the data, as do the echoes
caused by spurious reflections.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the new system uses relatively low frequencies, between
10 and 20 kilohertz. These are omnidirectional, so alignment is not
necessary. A high data rate is squeezed from the low frequency by
modulating a 15-kilohertz carrier wave using a technique called
phase shift keying, the same method the latest modems use to send
data along conventional phone lines at high speed. The carrier is
switched through four states, and the pattern of switching conveys
the data bits.
</P>
<P>
   The system also uses ``diversity reception,'' in which several
receivers are arranged in a ring. Each picks up the sound signal
from a different angle, which means that even if the sound reaching
some receivers is weak, others pick up stronger signals.
</P>
<P>
   The data stream includes reference markers that let the receiver
identify the strongest and cleanest signal, and strip out
distortion caused by echoes and by the Doppler shift-significant
because the speed of sound is so low.
</P>
<P>
   The Newcastle team recently tested the system in the Royal Quay
docks on Tyneside and is now confident enough to to try it out in
the North Sea. &QL;

 &HT;     DISSIDENT ROW OVERSHADOWS CHINESE MISSILE TALKS AT THE SUMMIT

beginning about 9 p.m. EDT.
 &HT;     With CLINTON-FLAPS-0627; CHINA-COMPOUND-$ADV27;

 &HT;     By JOSEPH ALBRIGHT and MARCIA KUNSTEL 
 &HT;     c.1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ American and Chinese flags flew side-by-side in
Tiananmen Square, heralding the arrival of U.S. President Bill
Clinton for summit talks expected to range from nuclear
proliferation to U.S.-China trade.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the symbolism of an emerging friendship, the opening of
talks was overshadowed by an unexpected row over China's detention
of dissidents.
</P>
<P>
   A big chill suddenly arose 24 hours earlier, during what was
supposed to be a low-pressure day of presidential sightseeing in
the ancient Chinese capital of Xi'an. When news reports told of
three or four Chinese dissidents arrested on the day of Clinton's
arrival, the White House reacted with harsh words.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are not debris to be swept up for a visitor, and we
have expressed our concern about this to the Chinese government,''
National Security Adviser Sandy Berger told reporters before the
presidential entourage flew to Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unacceptable in my judgment for people to be detained in
connection with an event like this,'' Berger added. ``This is not
surprising, but it's not acceptable.'' He predicted that Clinton
would pass on the same message Saturday in private talks with
Chinese President Jiang Zemin.
</P>
<P>
   A Chinese foreign ministry spokesman angrily denied that anyone
had been ``arrested,'' but left open the possibility that some
potential protesters may have been held in Xi'an for questioning
during the Clinton visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are opposed to any foreign country using the human rights
issue as a pretext to interfere in China's internal affairs,'' the
foreign ministry spokesman said late Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Once Clinton's airplane left Xi'an, Chinese authorities released
two of the local activists who had reportedly been held in custody.
One, 29-year-old Yang Hai, insisted he had been ``kidnapped'' by
police to bar him from meeting with foreign television journalists.
</P>
<P>
   With the Americans and Chinese entourages in disagreement about
the facts of the Xi'an detentions, Clinton gave a more guarded
reaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found the reports disturbing,'' he said. ``If true, they
represent not China at its best and not China looking forward but
looking backward.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton flew into Beijing Friday in hopes of wrapping up a
nuclear weapons ``detargeting'' agreement by which both sides would
pledge not to point their missiles at each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would certainly like such an agreement,'' Berger told
reporters in Xi'an.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Clinton's homefront critics have called a
``detargeting'' deal meaningless, arguing that a missile's
targeting coordinates can be secretly updated in less than 20
minutes. Clinton has replied that such an agreement could prevent
an accidental world war.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you detarget, yes, you can always go retarget a missile, we
all know that,'' Clinton said in a Washington interview with the
Cox News Service last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it takes some more time, and 20 minutes in a world of
instantaneous communications is an eternity. So the possibility of
avoiding a mistake, or even backing down from a conflict, is
dramatically increased with detargeting.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton reached America's first ``detargeting'' agreement with
Russian President Boris Yeltsin in 1994. Then Russia signed a
similar ``detargeting'' agreement with China in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   But for the last year, China has resisted American entreaties to
join in a mutual ``detargeting'' pact. A Chinese Foreign Ministry
spokesman insisted again this month that the United States must
first sign a ``no first use'' pledge, under which no future
American president could threaten nuclear strikes to deter a
non-nuclear ground or sea attack.
</P>
<P>
   Western intelligence agencies have reported that China has an
aging thermo-nuclear strike force of 13 to 18 intercontinental
ballistic missiles (ICBMs), including perhaps four with sufficient
range to hit New York City and Washington, D.C. According to
Chinese sources, each Chinese ICBM is armed with one city-busting
hydrogen bomb warhead of three-to-five megatons.
</P>
<P>
   Before heading to Beijing and the controversial Tiananmen Square
welcome, Clinton spent the day around Xi'an Friday, visiting
villages and touring China's most important archeological dig, the
2nd Century B.C. vault containing more than 7,000 ancient terra
cotta warriors, horses and chariots.
</P>
<P>
   In the nearby village of Xiahe, Clinton heard Yang Dongye, 56,
the owner of a soy sauce and vinegar factory, enthuse about how his
life has improved in China since the wave of private-enterprise
reforms initiated by the late communist leader Deng Xiaoping in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, no matter what your abilities are, you are told
to do what you are supposed to do,'' Yang said. ``But after the
reform, everyone can have the space to show their own talent and to
work very hard.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ Religion writers have never received so much attention
from distinguished religious leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Even Pope John Paul II, through an emissary, sent us a message
during the ``Religion and Media 2000'' conference this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``The role of the media is pervasive and powerful,'' the
statement declares.
</P>
<P>
   ``His Holiness fervently hopes your dialogue will produce a
shared vision of the human person and human society so that from
that basis religion and the media may work together for the good of
all,'' the statement says.
</P>
<P>
   It was read by Cardinal William Keeler of Baltimore, a strong
advocate for more cooperation among members of religious groups and
the media.
</P>
<P>
   The goal of the meeting was to begin an ongoing dialogue between
journalists and religious leaders to improve the quality of
religion coverage.
</P>
<P>
   What set the conference apart was that it not only included
religion writers but also influential editors and publishers. On
the religious side, it included four cardinals. One of those,
Cardinal Francis Arinze, was recently listed by U.S. News and World
Report as a leading candidate to be the next pope.
</P>
<P>
   Gunther Lawrence, director of the Interreligious Information
Center in New York, coordinated Christian and Jewish leaders, the
Vatican and members of the Religion Newswriters Association, a
national organization of journalists who cover religion for secular
newspapers, magazines and broadcast outlets.
</P>
<P>
   ABC, NBC and CBS networks were represented, as well as CNN,
which is contemplating hiring a religion specialist. National
Public Radio's religion reporter, Lynn Neary, was a speaker.
</P>
<P>
   In an opening address, Lawrence said many conference
participants believe that religion coverage will play an even more
important role in the next millennium.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe there is a window of opportunity to expand and
improve religion coverage,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The keynote speaker, David Lawrence Jr., chairman and publisher
of the Miami Herald, minced no words in taking religion coverage to
task.
</P>
<P>
   ``Religion is the greatest story seldom told,'' he declared.
</P>
<P>
   While acknowledging that some news outlets cover religion well,
Lawrence said, ``Most of us do a profoundly inadequate job in
covering matters of faith.''
</P>
<P>
   Joaquin Navarro-Valls, director of the Vatican press office,
said there is room for improvement by religious leaders who
disseminate the news and by religion reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm not pessimistic about religion coverage,'' he said.
``I see some good signs.''
</P>
<P>
   Conference participants had front-row seats at an audience with
the pope, and the pontiff was expected to meet some of the
conference leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Archbishop John P. Foley, an American who is president of the
Vatican's Pontifical Council on Social Communications, said future
meetings are planned between leaders of religion and the media.
</P>
<P>
   The conference participants will support efforts to train
journalists better in religion coverage. Discussions are under way
to hold regional conferences between religious and media
representatives, Foley said.
</P>
<P>
   The high goals for religion coverage expressed in the ``Religion
and Media 2000'' conference may bear fruit well into the next
century.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have had a good beginning,'' Foley said.

HE'S A BILLIONAIRE. ENOUGH, ALREADY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DR. EMILIO BOMBAY 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: Do you think that a simple, basic user (word
processing, E-mail, simple spreadsheets) has any use for Windows
98?
</P>
<P>
   _ 95 and Counting
</P>
<P>
   DEAR COUNTING: No.
</P>
<P>
   Look, if you're happy with the way everything is working on your
computer now, and you aren't one of those geeks who has to have the
very latest version of everything, I can't think of any compelling
reason for you to make Bill Gates any richer. Win 98 is just a
spiffed-up, less buggy version of Win 95.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, if you haven't bought a PC yet, I'd
definitely wait until you can get one with 98 pre-installed for
precisely the same reason: It's less buggy.
</P>
<P>
   On the third hand, if you'd just like to get Janet Reno's goat
by making all those antitrust suits even more pointless than they
already are, grab your copy today.
</P>
<P>
   I've been using the 98 beta for a couple of months now, and I
like it, but it's certainly nothing revolutionary. It definitely
hasn't improved my quality of life all that much, as if anything
but Ed McMahon standing on my doorstep with a really big check
could do that. Trust me, most casual PC users can get by with Win
95 until it's time to get a new computer.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: While browsing the Web during my lunch hour, I
spotted a link to ``The X-Files.'' Thinking it was the TV show, I
clicked on the link. Yep, you guessed it. It was XXX files.
Ordinarily, this is not a problem. I just back out of the page and
proceed to my next destination. This time it would not let me. I
tried to exit Netscape. Every time it closed a window another
opened. I had to turn my computer off to get it to stop. The attack
program somehow rewrote some of my system files. The computer gurus
here at work had to dump my hard drive and reload all my programs.
What happened?
</P>
<P>
   _ Innocent Bystander
</P>
<P>
   DEAR INNOCENT: Back in my day, the worst that could happen if
you looked at one too many dirty pictures was that you'd go blind.
These days you wind up losing your hard drive, too.
</P>
<P>
   OK, so you were just looking for Mulder and Scully and you wound
up _ completely by accident _ in porno-ville instead. I'm sure the
boys in Technical Services believed you.
</P>
<P>
   I think I found the site you described. It took hours of
painstaking research on my part, and I may well have lost sight in
one eye, but I see what you mean about all those irritating
secondary windows that keep popping up.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most annoying features of recent versions of HTML,
the language used to create Web pages, is its ability to launch a
concurrent browser session with another site. Click on your Back
button and a second window pops up. Go forward and get another. Try
one of the dozens of lurid links and two or three more may clutter
up your screen. And, at the site I visited, there was one
programming error that put me in an endless loop of come-ons from
what I can only assume wasn't the home page of a children's petting
zoo.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on your browser version and the amount o memory your
computer has, something's eventually going to go out to lunch. It's
unlikely that the smut peddler embedded any search-and-destroy
programs in the page, though. Turning Windows off with so many
things running probably goofed something up. If using Scandisk and
uninstalling Netscape didn't fix things, then a reformat was
probably the only way to go.
</P>
<P>
   You know, I think I need glasses now.
</P>

CAMP SWAPS LAUGHTER FOR AIDS BURDENS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GRACIE BONDS STAPLES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Randy is 11 years old and already worried about death and dying.
And he shouldn't be. No child should, really.
</P>
<P>
   And so he and the others _ about 65 children affected in some
way by the virus that causes AIDS _ have gathered to set aside for
a time the burdens that have been thrust upon them.
</P>
<P>
   They have come together, for one week, to be children again.
</P>
<P>
   It is a few days before summer, and I am seated on a green park
bench under a billowing canopy of trees when Randy emerges from the
crowd to talk with me. He has already donned the signature Camp
Firelight T-shirt. He is small, with a sweet, narrow face to match
his sweet demeanor.
</P>
<P>
   He talks easily at first about his camp experience last year,
about his family, but he suddenly pulls back when he realizes that
he has just shared with a stranuer that his mother might die of
AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really know what it means,'' he says. ``I just hope
she doesn't die from it. I keep praying so she won't.''
</P>
<P>
   Before long, anxiety lets go of his face and drops from his
shoulders, and we are re-engaged. There are countless little boys
named Randy, he reasons, who live in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Randy has come to Camp Firelight, a program of the AIDS Outreach
Center, for the second time in as many years. He is looking forward
to another week of fishing, of arts and crafts and archery. Kid
things he doesn't get to experience very often.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're little like me,'' he says, ``some things you can't
do. Like sometimes you can't go fishing.''
</P>
<P>
   And sometimes, when the adult world beckons, when danger lurks
as it so often does in Randy's world, forfeiting one's childhood
may be the only way to survive.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things that we know about this population of
children is that they are either homeless or live in neighborhoods
where they can't play outside,'' Trisha Kus told me recently as the
camp got under way at the Lockheed Martin Recreation Association.
``So many of them during the summer must stay inside to play, or
they don't play at all.''
</P>
<P>
   And so on this day, 62 children, including Randy, have come just
to play. Of those, 16 are HIV-positive. The remainder either have a
family member with AIDS or one who has died of the disease.
</P>
<P>
   At camp, though, they don't talk about HIV or AIDS. They don't
talk about death or dying. Not between 5:30 and 8:30 p.m., anyway.
Between those hours, for one week, they are simply themselves: kids
without a care in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``These children have adult-sized responsibilities,'' says LeAnn
Griffin, coordinator of youth services. ``Camp is a chance for them
to experience the therapeutic joy of being a child.''
</P>
<P>
   It is why the center, with funding from the Junior League of
Arlington and Levi Strauss &AMP; Co., started Camp Firelight two years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really fun last year,'' Randy remembers. ``I can shoot
arrows here and find out all sorts of things I don't know about. I
can walk around. I can meet more people. It's a real fun camp.''
</P>
<P>
   And a cherished moment for a child haunted by death and dying.

ROMANCE BETWEEN THE LINES 
</HEADLINE>
  Stephan Talty is a critic and columnist.  
 (bl)  
 By STEPHAN TALTY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There are people who read the obituaries
recreationally, and then there are people like me, who turn
immediately to the wedding announcements. What you have here is a
tug of war between the hard realists and the romantics.
</P>
<P>
   I once wrote obits, when I was a reporter trainee at The Miami
Herald. It was a job I took seriously. I spent hours on the
telephone with relatives (who were surprisingly eager to talk _ you
could hear the fresh emptiness of the house behind them) looking
for the human detail.
</P>
<P>
   But after writing 100 obituaries, you don't want to think about
coronary thrombosis and survivors anymore; you want to read about
beginnings, about great risk and social drama. There is no better
place to find these elusive things than the wedding pages. The
reasons are many:
</P>
<P>
   WEDDING ANNOUNCEMENTS ARE HOPEFUL. Where else can you find a
photographic representation of early love so fresh and convincing?
The couples on the wedding pages look so darn happy to be with each
other: their cheeks are touching, they lean into the future and
form small upside-down V's of closeness.
</P>
<P>
   Most married couples I see on the street look as if they're
having to-the-death boredom contests. Without the evidence of
wedding page photos, no one in his or her right mind would ever get
married.
</P>
<P>
   THEY ARE OUTLINES FOR NOVELS YOU WRITE IN YOUR HEAD. Start with
the photo, which is filled with clues to the marriage. Sometimes
you sigh and think, ``It's just not going to work.'' The bride or
the bridegroom has manipulated the physical space of the photo too
aggressively. I give those marriages two years at the outside. If
someone's going to crowd you out of your own engagement shot, you'd
better watch your back. But some people truly seem destined to be
together; even before they're married, their faces reveal a kind of
harmonic convergence.
</P>
<P>
   If I were writing the announcement, I would always include where
the bride and bridegroom met; it's essential to any imagining of
their courtship story. As it is now, I usually have to fill in the
blank myself. I'm convinced that all the stockbrokers and the
private-school elementary teachers (a classic combo) meet at the
Raccoon Lodge on the Upper East Side, a raging marriage bazaar of
the upper class. Since young lawyers have no real lives, I'm
convinced their marriages are arranged by a little old woman at the
New York Bar Association, who pairs them by using a complex
formula: law-school class rank times hours billed, divided by
height. The investment bankers who hook up with marketing
executives (very common, by the way), I see coming together while
Rollerblading in Central Park.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone else meets at Barnes &AMP; Noble.
</P>
<P>
   THE ANNOUNCEMENTS REVEAL THE ENDURANCE OF CLASS STRUCTURE IN
AMERICA. Marx never wrote much about marriage, but it is a much
more powerful class-forming tool than the country club swimming
pool or brunch in the Hamptons. People overwhelmingly marry people
of the same background. It makes you think that the next great
American revolutionary will operate an interclass dating service.
</P>
<P>
   But, once in a while, you get people who break free of the
unwritten code. As a son of the working class, I admit to being a
fan of the announcements where someone whose grandfather was one of
the founders of Standard Oil marries someone whose father operates
a gas station in Centralia, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   In these cases, I've noticed, the gas station heir, male or
female, is often blessed with great beauty. I believe this is a
Darwinian survival instinct built into rich people's DNA _ if they
didn't marry gorgeous people once in a while, they'd get so
lockjawed their kind would die out.
</P>
<P>
   SINGLE PEOPLE CAN PICK UP ALL KINDS OF TIPS. The announcements
reveal to the single man a breathtaking horizon of women-meeting
possibilities. When a Connecticut optometrist marries a salsa
dancer whose parents are sorghum farmers living in Shanghai, that's
bracing news to the guy who spends his mornings trying to think up
lines to use on the woman ahead of him at the local bagelry.
</P>
<P>
   The downside is that each Sunday, more beautiful, interesting
women are taken off the market. Blown opportunities shock me. The
worst is the homely girl I remember from high school who suddenly
appears on the wedding pages newly made-over, engaged and soon to
be rich. Some people have no self-restraint.
</P>
<P>
   I've realized that, at 33, a certain competitiveness has crept
into my reading. ``Getting hitched at 25?'' I think. ``Are they
insane?'' I think of anyone under 30 who appears in these pages as
tremendously rash, shoving to the front of the line. (I did consent
to attend my younger brother's wedding, although I thought he
should have waited. Birth order is obligation, James.)
</P>
<P>
   I silently thank all the 38-year-olds; they are my allies. If
their eyes are a little less giddy and their smiles touched with
wistfulness, so be it. They seem to nod at me from the photos. ``No
rush, old man,'' they say. ``Plenty of fish in the sea.''
</P>
<P>
   The 43-year-old bridegrooms, on the other hand, are terrifying.
``Getting hitched at 43? Is he insane?'' I ask. He's not, of
course. It's just that I can't bear the thought of a full decade
more of hanging out at clubs and saying things like, ``Where do I
put the quarter to get a smile?''
</P>
<P>
   MANY PEOPLE READ THE WEDDING ANNOUNCEMENTS TO SPOT THEIR
FRIENDS. I have to call these people what they are: dilettantes.
Most of my straight friends have gone down the long white linen
road already; my siblings are all married. Announcement-reading is
more than a personal gossip hunt for me; it's become a bittersweet
ritual of the single life.
</P>
<P>
   Only my gay friends are still unattached; but they don't seem to
share my pastime. When I told my college roommate about it, he
scoffed and called the wedding announcements ``the women's sports
pages.''

   Being a straight, single man and halfway athletic, I'm supposed
to turn to the sports scores every Sunday morning. And, believe me,
I do. It's just that there's so much more at stake on the wedding
pages, and the winners and losers have yet to be decided.

REPLACING YOUR OS IS SERIOUS BUSINESS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Listen. Hear that sound? It's the siren song of Microsoft's
marketing, calling you to buy Windows 98 and slap it on your
personal computer.
</P>
<P>
   The gang in Redmond, Wash., would have you believe that
installing Windows 98 is a breeze. And yes, installing Windows 98
usually is less hassle than installing Windows 95.
</P>
<P>
   But make no mistake _ changing a PC's operating system should
not be considered minor surgery. You are switching out the core
software system that controls how your computer behaves, and doing
so should not be taken lightly.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some steps you can take to prevent problems.
</P>
<P>
   Begin by making notes about the most basic components of your
system. Make a list of all your settings. That includes the phone
number for your Internet provider's dial-up line; networking
settings if you connect to the office intranet or have a
complicated Internet setup; any login names and passwords. In other
words, if you have made a change to one of Windows' standard
settings, find it and write it down.
</P>
<P>
   Why should you do this? The full version of Windows 98, which is
different from the upgrade version in that it can be installed on a
computer that doesn't yet have an operating system, overwrote some
of the network settings on two computers I tested. While the
upgrade version did not have this effect, it doesn't hurt to take
precautions.
</P>
<P>
   Next, make a complete backup of your hard drives. If you don't
have a tape drive or a removable large-storage device, such as a
Zip drive, and you're not willing to spend an afternoon feeding
your machine dozens of floppy disks, at least back up any crucial
data. After all, you can always reinstall Quicken if you have the
original disk, but you can't replace the data files it generates.
</P>
<P>
   Make sure you have a Windows 95 boot disk that will let you
reinstall the original operating system from the CD-ROM drive. That
means having AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS files that contain lines
referring to your CD-ROM drivers on the floppy. During its
installation process, Windows 98 creates a boot disk that will
power a CD-ROM drive, but if something goes horribly wrong, you
should have a Windows 95 boot disk, too.
</P>
<P>
   Check the Web sites for the manufacturers of your various
hardware components _ graphics card, sound card, printer, etc. _
and grab the latest drivers. In most cases, Windows 95 and 98
drivers are the same, and you can install the latest drivers before
running the Windows 98 setup. But if you find Windows 98-specific
drivers, wait until the new operating system is installed before
you update them.
</P>
<P>
   If you use a utility package, such as Norton Utilities or First
Aid, contact the maker of the program to see if a software patch is
necessary to make it compatible with Windows 98. Programs such as
these, which often work with some of the ground-level components of
an operating system, are most apt to have problems.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Windows 98's disk defragmenter arranges files
differently on a hard drive, putting files related to each program
in consecutive order, and putting the most-used programs on the
fastest part of the disk. But if you run Norton Utilities'
SpeedDisk on a Windows 98 drive that's been set up this way,
SpeedDisk will undo those changes. Symantec has a patch for Norton
Utilities 3.0 that will fix this problem, but versions 1 and 2 of
Norton Utilities remain incompatible.
</P>
<P>
   It's also not a bad idea to check with the maker of your PC for
potential incompatibilities. I discovered that putting Windows 98
on an IBM ThinkPad 600 _ a new line of portables _ renders the
built-in modem unusable. PC Magazine reports that a fix is on the
way from IBM.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of whether you're upgrading from Windows 3.1 or
Windows 95, you should pare your system down to its essentials.
That means disabling any software that runs in the background and
watches for certain events, such as virus-checkers, crash
prevention programs and installation monitors.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it's not a bad idea remove all shortcuts from the
Startup group and store them in a temporary folder on your desktop.
</P>
<P>
   Once you launch the Windows 98 setup program, installation takes
between 30 and 60 minutes. Your system will reboot several times,
and the way Microsoft has structured the installation makes it less
likely that your computer will lock up in the process _ a common
problem with the Windows 95 routine.
</P>
<P>
   That's because the entire operating system is loaded and your
computer rebooted before Windows starts trying to detect hardware
and install drivers. This strategy alone goes a long way to making
the Windows 98 setup a more pleasant experience.
</P>
<P>
   Windows 98's install routine provides you with few choices when
you use the standard upgrade version. It does not, for example,
give you options about which components to install. It makes
decisions based on what's already on your system, presuming you'll
want to keep your current settings and features. You'll be asked
whether you want to save your Windows 95 files, in case you want to
go back to the older operating system. This will take up about 50
megabytes.
</P>
<P>
   I'm happy to report that the uninstall routine for Windows 98
works quite well. That's how I got the modem working again in that
ThinkPad! However, be aware that if you installed any software
while Windows 98 was on your system, you'll need to reinstall it.
Removing Windows 98 puts your system back exactly as it was before
you started on this, um, adventure.

MAZDA 626 GETS EVEN BETTER WITH REDESIGN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By G. CHAMBERS WILLIAMS III 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the best midsize sedans on the market has gotten much
better for 1998 with the complete redesign of the Mazda 626.
</P>
<P>
   Mazda, the company that makes the highest-quality affordable
cars in the world, has raised the bar with the new 626, creating a
formidable competitor to its main Japanese rivals, the Honda Accord
and Toyota Camry.
</P>
<P>
   The new 626 has been largely patterned after Mazda's flagship
Millenia luxury sedan, with virtually the same front end, V-6 power
and smooth, quiet ride. The 626, whose leather-equipped premium ES
model is just $23,995, is so similar to the Millenia that it is apt
to steal sales away from that vehicle, which lists for $5,000 more.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers already are finding that the 626 offers more car for
the money that any midsize competitor _ foreign or domestic _ and
sales of the new model are booming.
</P>
<P>
   For those of you familiar with the previous 626, you'll find the
new one taller, longer, wider and roomier, with comfortable seating
for five adults and a trunk large enough for extended cruising or a
wagonload of groceries.
</P>
<P>
   Even the base DX model that begins at $15,695 comes with the
Millenia styling. Of course, to turn the 626 into a true
Millenia-like sedan with all the amenities, you'll have to choose
the top-of-the-line ES model, which we tested.
</P>
<P>
   The DX, designed as a value leader and most apt to be found in
rental-car and corporate fleets, comes with a 2.0-liter
four-cylinder engine rated at 125 horsepower and 127 foot-pounds of
torque. Power is adequate, although not impressive.
</P>
<P>
   Midlevel LX models, which begin at $17,895, also come with the
four-cylinder engine, but the 2.5-liter, 24-valve V-6 is available
for $1,900 more. The V-6 engine, which puts the 626 almost into the
performance-sports-sedan class, cranks out 170 horsepower and 163
foot-pounds of torque. The V-6 is standard in the ES.
</P>
<P>
   All 626 models can be ordered with either a five-speed manual or
four-speed automatic transmission.
</P>
<P>
   Mazda chose to provide a manual-transmission model for our test
drive.
</P>
<P>
   That's unfortunate, because a manual transmission is an
unnecessary and somewhat silly option for a midsize family sedan
such as this. The vast majority of buyers will choose the
automatic. It's awfully hard to shift gears and talk on the cell
phone at the same time, especially in stop-and-go rush-hour
traffic, so the manual gearbox is actually a liability for most
people who buy cars in this vehicle class.
</P>
<P>
   But the V-6 engine is smooth and responsive, with plenty of
power for freeway merges and passing.
</P>
<P>
   Traction control is standard on V-6 models. This computerized
system senses wheel spin and gently applies brakes to the spinning
wheel to stop the spin and transfer power to the other front wheel.
</P>
<P>
   Improvements in both the engine and the 626's body have reduced
noise, vibration and harshness considerably from previous models.
Mazda says structural rigidity has increased 43 percent through the
use of new frame supports.
</P>
<P>
   The ride is as quiet and smooth as that of most $30,000-plus
luxury cars, yet the Mazda offers sporty handling characteristics
that make it glide through twists and turns. That's due in part to
the speed-sensitive power steering (standard on all models), as
well as the front MacPherson-struts and unique twin-trapezoidal
rear suspension, with both front and rear stabilizer bars.
</P>
<P>
   ES models come with a whole list of luxury items, beginning with
the very nice leather seats. There are comfortable front bucket
seats and a rear bench with a split-folding seatback. The rear seat
has full seat and shoulder belts for all three passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Other ES amenities include a Bose AM/FM/compact-disc audio
system, 15-inch aluminum-alloy wheels (with locks), power driver's
seat, leather-wrapped steering wheel, power glass moon roof, power
antenna, and vinyl door-trim panels.
</P>
<P>
   Standard on LX and ES models are air-conditioning; cruise
control; dual power outside mirrors; power trunk release; auto-off
headlights; power windows and door locks; a security system with
remote keyless entry and a computerized setup that immobilizes the
car unless the special ignition key is used.
</P>
<P>
   There were no options on our test car; everything was standard
for the list price of $24,495 (including $450 transportation).
</P>
<P>
   Mazda builds the 626 at its Flat Rock, Mich., plant, and the
vehicles have more than 75 percent U.S. content. That qualifies
them as domestic cars. They're also union-made vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Fuel economy for the V-6 is a respectable 21 miles per gallon in
the city and 27 on the highway. The tank holds 16.9 gallons of gas,
giving the 626 great cruising range.

WINDOWS 95 LIKELY BETTER CHOICE FOR OLD 486 THAN THE 98 UPGRADE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I thought I was being real smart by bypassing Windows 95 and
waiting for Windows 98. Windows 3.1 runs just fine on my computer,
and I figured I'd wait until Microsoft got it right with Windows
95. Now, I have a real dinosaur of a computer, and I'm starting to
think I can't use Windows 98 on it. It's a 486, with a 33-megahertz
chip and eight megabytes of RAM. I presume I'll have to upgrade the
memory, maybe to 16 megabytes, but what about the rest of it? Oh
yeah, I have a 500-megabyte hard drive.
</P>
<P>
   A: Microsoft is infamous for understating the requirements for
its operating systems. Windows 95, for example, supposedly will run
with four megabytes of memory on a 386 system. But anyone who's
tried that knows the result is more pain than gain.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Windows 95's practical minimum is a 486 PC with at
least 16 megabytes of memory _ and that is indeed a minimum. As an
operating system, Windows 95 doesn't start to feel snappy until
you're using a 486 running at 66 megahertz or better, with 32
megabytes of RAM. And you can't say it's a ``fast'' operating
system until you move to a Pentium.
</P>
<P>
   Windows 98's official minimum specifications called for a 486-66
PC with 16 megabytes of memory, and anywhere from 200 to nearly 400
megabytes of memory free on the hard drive. Given that the
browser-as-desktop interface is resource-intensive and can slow
down older Pentium systems, I wouldn't recommend it for a 486 PC.
I've seen Windows 98 running on a Pentium 90 with 32 megabytes of
memory, and it's not pretty.
</P>
<P>
   However, once you move into the upper strata _ say, a Pentium
MMX 166-megahertz system or faster _ Windows 98 feels snappier than
the Windows 95/Internet Explorer 4 combination.
</P>
<P>
   In your case, I'd recommend you get Windows 95 instead if you
don't want to buy a new machine. But definitely upgrade your memory
to at least 32 megabytes.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I took your advice, upgraded from Windows 3.11 to 95, getting
a new 300 megahertz Pentium II in the process. This is the upside.
The downside is I lost use of my old faithful Procomm (MS-DOS
version), so am unable to access HAL-PC BBS. Can you suggest a
solution to my problem?
</P>
<P>
   A: Sounds like the computer you bought, while a powerhouse, has
a modem with limited capabilities. It's likely a Winmodem, which
only can be used with the Windows 95/98 operating systems. These
are made by various manufacturers, including U.S. Robotics and
Lucent Technologies.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that much of their ``guts'' is software-based,
loaded as part of Windows. When Windows isn't present, neither is
the modem.
</P>
<P>
   You have several options. The first is to use the built-in,
Windows-based terminal program called HyperTerminal, which may or
may not be installed on your system. If it is, you'll find it in
the Programs/Accessories/Communications folder off the Start menu.
If not, you can add it using the Windows Setup tab in the
Add/Remove programs module in the Control Panel.
</P>
<P>
   HyperTerminal is not a great solution _ I find it somewhat
awkward to use _ but it will do the trick.
</P>
<P>
   Another option is to buy a copy of the Windows version of
Procomm Plus. It comes in two forms _ the full version, complete
with all kinds of Internet utilities you may or may not need _ and
a simpler edition called Procomm Connections. You can find out more
at www.quarterdeck.com.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, you could replace that Winmodem with a traditional
modem that will work in MS-DOS, but this is your most expensive
``fix.''

DESPITE ARGUMENTS TO THE CONTRARY, THE GUNS BELONG TO US
</HEADLINE>

c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a
free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall
not be infringed.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Second Amendment to the Constitution of the United States,
ratified Dec. 15, 1791
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   A push to exact more stringent control over guns is once again
under way in this country, and far and wide one can hear the
familiar but tiresome refrain about how the Founding Fathers never
meant that individuals should be armed when they wrote the Second
Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   My, but it do make me weary.
</P>
<P>
   In 1789, when James Madison first introduced what ultimately
became the Bill of Rights, he stated that the amendments ``relate
first to private rights.'' Reference to ``the right of the people''
appears in the First, Second, Fourth, Ninth and 10th amendments.
And the courts have time and again ruled that these rights belong
to individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Second Amendment originated in the United States
Congress in 1789, that august body has three times _ in 1886 with
the Freedmen's Bureau Act, in 1941 with the Property Requisition
Act, and in 1986 with the Firearms Owners' Protection Act _ passed
legislation to reaffirm this guarantee of personal freedom and to
adopt specific safeguards to enforce it.
</P>
<P>
   Get a copy of the 1995 Tennessee Law Review devoted to the
Second Amendment and read the chapter by author Stephen Halbrook, a
Virginia attorney and former professor at the Tuskegee Institute
and Howard University. He provides a well-researched look at how
Congress has repeatedly interpreted the Second Amendment through
the years to reaffirm an individual's right ``to keep and bear
Arms.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the anti-gun folk spend a great deal of their energy
fomenting support for the abolishment of personal ownership of
firearms by defining the amendment's ``well regulated Militia'' in
today's terms of a national guard.
</P>
<P>
   Let's, just for the sake of argument, go with the anti-gun folk
on this. Let's assume that Americans are amenable to the idea of
assigning the duty of protecting individual citizens to the
government ...
</P>
<P>
   ``What am I saying?'' I can't even do this in the abstract. The
Second Amendment reaches beyond the guarantee of an individual's
right to protect hearth and home. It is the guarantee of an
individual's right to protection FROM a tyrannical government.
</P>
<P>
   It is at the very core of the American culture not to trust
authority. That is what has made this nation fiercely independent.
Our Founding Fathers deliberately decided to design a system of
government like no other on Earth, one that was the epitome of
human freedoms and individual liberties.
</P>
<P>
   David Kopel, author of ``The Samurai, The Mountie and the
Cowboy,'' summed up the feelings of millions of Americans about the
government's ability to take care of its people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans did not trust the government for protection in the
19th century, and they don't trust it today,'' Kopel wrote in his
1992 book about whether gun control laws in other democracies _
Japan, Great Britain, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Jamaica and
Switzerland _ would work in the United States. ``The failure or
inability of the modern American state to control crime makes it
particularly unlikely that Americans could be persuaded by statute
to give up their guns.''
</P>
<P>
   Amen, brother. Overall, crime is down, and we can thank in large
part zero-tolerance initiatives, increased law enforcement spending
and enhanced community vigilance (some of us would include
concealed-carry permits on that list). But until the day comes when
all citizens are guaranteed that the police will be there when they
need them, and not just after the fact to pick up the pieces and ID
the bodies, we must strongly and loudly proclaim our right to
protect ourselves.
</P>
<P>
   The Bill of Rights is the mandate from the people to the
government about those rights we will not relinquish.
</P>
<P>
   Is there still too much crime and violence in this country? Yes.
But people _ particularly politicians interested in snappy sound
bites _ get fixated on the hardware and not the individual using
it. It's easy, and judging by the continued attacks on the Second
Amendment, it works.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not the answer.

VOICE MATTERS ON THE SILVER SCREEN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, June 28)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By AMY BIANCOLLI  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In ``Singin' in the Rain,'' Stanley Donen's brilliant spoof of
old Hollywood, a squeaky-voiced, platinum-shagged silent film
goddess named Lina Lamont (played by Jean Hagen) is faced with a
terrifying reality: sound.
</P>
<P>
   Movies are starting to talk, and she's got a voice that pops
light bulbs. ``I ceeeeeen't steend 'im!'' bleats Lina in her
strangled helium soprano, asher voice coach reacts with stoicism
and dismay. Gently, she corrects her: ``I caaaahn't staaahnd him.''
</P>
<P>
   Lina tries again: ``I ceeen't steend 'im!'' The coach corrects
her. And corrects her. Finally, after weeks of struggling, Lina
repeats the line on screen: ``I caaaahhhhn't steend 'im!''
</P>
<P>
   It's a great moment in film, hilarious because it captures the
dilemma facing actors at the advent of sound in the late 1920s.
Stars with good voices Ronald Colman, for instance survived the
transition to talking pictures. The Linas of the world did not.
</P>
<P>
   But movie history is crammed with little ironies, and lovely
Lina could well have her revenge: Were she flesh and blood and
making films today, she might be starring for a few cool mil in a
flick with Harrison Ford. These days, a lot of bad voices are
making a lot of good money.
</P>
<P>
   Skeptical? Talk to James Spruill, an associate professor of
theater at Boston University and an acting pedagogue who has taught
the likes of Angela Bassett.
</P>
<P>
   ``Talent and training often have nothing to do with (an actor's)
work, because casting is done cosmetically,'' said Spruill, who
says African-American actors have among the most naturally resonant
voices. ``The most important thing is `the look.'''
</P>
<P>
   Spruill knows whereof he speaks: he's heard a lot of shriekers
in his day. ``Especially,'' he said, ``the young women who have
voices that would shatter glass.''
</P>
<P>
   He didn't name names, but two words spring to mind: Renee
Zellweger (the cheeping star of ``Jerry Maguire''). And three more:
Joey Lauren Adams (the shrilling star of ``Chasing Amy''). And
another two: Anne Heche (the whining star of ``Six Days, Seven
Nights''). Not to mention Maria Pitillo (peep), Rosie Perez
(squeak), Jennifer Jason Leigh (drone) and Fran Drescher (squawk).
</P>
<P>
   Nor are men excluded from the club of tweedlers and yawpers.
Chris O'Donnell projects his tenor directly through his nose,
seemingly bypassing his vocal cords entirely. Tom Cruise, certified
hunkdom notwithstanding, has one of the most nasal voices on the
planet; his scenes with Zellweger in ``Jerry Maguire'' are enough
to frizz your eyebrows. Tom Selleck is another nose-talker. Matthew
McConaughey isn't, but his voice is still as flat as toast he's the
It Boy with the vocal resonance of a bottle fly.
</P>
<P>
   Brad Pitt has a nice set of pipes, but he's never quite learned
to enunciate (did you understand anything he said in
``Sleepers''?). Talented Leonardo DiCaprio is too young to peg: In
a few years he'll either have a mature, ringing tenor or the
muffling jabber of a mouth stuffed with Cheerios. The gift is
there; the charisma is there; the voice, one hopes, will follow.
</P>
<P>
   Marlon Brando was swallowing his consonants years before
DiCaprio came along but Brando was Brando, and he got away with it
because he paired it with a full battleship of acting guns.
</P>
<P>
   Thespian prowess and innate vocal charms don't always go
hand-in-hand (or hand-in-mouth). Still, stardom has come a long way
since 1933, when Claude Rains stunned audiences with a
career-making debut in ``The Invisible Man'' using his voice alone.
Not until the film's closing moments does his face appear,
flickering into view just before the credits roll.
</P>
<P>
   Rains could pull it off because he had one of the best voices in
movie history: urbane but gritty, silken but laced with threat. It
was a golden throat for a golden era.
</P>
<P>
   There are still a few good voices out there. George Clooney has
the raw material for a gorgeous, rolling baritone. His erstwhile
``E.R.'' co-star, Sherry Stringfield, owns an alto made from melted
butter. Bassett can soothe or sing, Susan Sarandon fells men with
her breathy delivery, and James Earl Jones' deep, shuddering boom
could possibly rouse the dead.
</P>
<P>
   Women (and a few men) wilt before the rich British rumbles of
Sean Connery, Anthony Hopkins, Patrick Stewart. Kathleen Turner has
a sturdy, come-hither huskiness despite her geographically obscure
accent. Alec Baldwin's got a sexy rasp, while Mel Gibson has a
good, honest, meat-and-potatoes voice box (he even sang in
``Pocahontas''). As for Morgan Freeman, he can make anything sound
like Shakespeare.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for each one of these silky talkers, there's another whose
delivery rakes the blackboard. This isn't a new phenomenon limited,
unidimensional or otherwise imperfect voices have always had their
place in cinema.
</P>
<P>
   Jean Arthur (``Mr. Smith Goes to Washington'') was the squeaky
talker to end all squeaky talkers (including Zellweger). And Clark
Gable, he of the swaggering Y chromosome, had a high-pitched voice
that started out nasal and only became more so with age. But Gable
knew how to hurl a line of dialogue, turning that schnozz-heavy
tenor into a powerful tool of seduction.
</P>
<P>
   No, you don't need a mellifluous throat to get the girl (or the
boy). Jack Nicholson is living proof that a bad voice, well-used,
can be as great an asset as the pearliest throat trained for opera.
And it's worth remembering that Humphrey Bogart had a triumphantly
awful voice, scabrous and flat, yet he used it to woo babes, and
moviegoers, for close to three decades.
</P>
<P>
   Movies are all about personality. And they're all about
connections: How the actor connects to his character, how the
character connects to the film, how the film connects to the
audience. A provocative or inviting voice can be the stuff that
glues an actor to his part and binds a viewer to the story.

   ``If Grace Kelly is on the French Riviera with her mother, (her
co-star) is going to have to look like Cary Grant ... and he's
going to have to sound like Cary Grant, too,'' said David Downs, a
theater professor at Northwestern University and author of ``The
Actor's Eye: Seeing and Being Seen.''
</P>
<P>
   No one wants to hear a pea-voiced man romance a Hitchcock
blonde; that's not what the movies are for.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's the whole thing about voice and looks and eyes and
smile that all go together,'' Downs said. ``Well, the actor is just
part of the package of the film.''

   An ill-fitting or inappropriate voice can ``translate into a
kind of falseness,'' said Michael Hammond, an actor and
administrator at Shakespeare &AMP; Company in Lenox, Mass. ``Rather
than the film actor having to have a necessarily developed or
trained voice, he or she has to modulate the voice so it
corresponds with what we're seeing and what we're watching. ... An
actor has to be very, very careful that the vocal performance
doesn't bely the physical performance in some way.''
</P>
<P>
   As Hammond was quick to point out, good movie voices are not the
same as good theatrical voices. ``Whereas the stage actor certainly
needs to concern himself or herself with being heard and being
understood, and can't necessarily rely on the idiosyncratic charm
of his or her voice,'' he said, ``a film actor can do just that can
have the most open, free, released, expressive voice, modulated for
film, or can have the most pinched, peculiar,
bordering-on-incomprehensible voice, and be all the more hireable
for that.''
</P>
<P>
   So Grant could speak in his mid-Atlantic lilt, Mae West could
purr with her sexiest see-saw whine, and James Mason could pour
vocal honey all over his leading ladies never fretting about the
audience's ability to hear. The downside, here, is that an actor
accustomed to film (and television) could lose her powers of
projection.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more work you do in television and film, the more
destroyed your voice gets,'' Spruill said. The most commonly used
microphone on film and TV sets is so sensitive ``that actors don't
have to do any work at vocal projection. So that eventually, it
destroys their voice.''
</P>
<P>
   Many actors working today have been deeply influenced by Kristin
Linklater, who helped found Shakespeare &AMP; Company and whose writing
(``Freeing the Natural Voice'') promotes a whole-body method of
relaxation and emotional expression that expands range and adds
resonance. Nils Haaland, an actor and teacher at the Omaha Theater
Company for Young People, was trained in Linklater methods at the
State University College at Purchase, N.Y., and swears by their
results. They have ``absolutely'' made a difference in his career,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the one thing that people will really comment on ...
`Oh, you have such a great stage voice, you have such a great
voice,'' said Haaland, who has a broadly resonant tenor. ``Before I
went to school, before Purchase, I had a very high, squeaky,
nasal-pitched voice. I had no awareness whatsoever of my voice.''
</P>
<P>
   The training, he said, ``has given a real advantage to my acting
I just know where to pull from for different characters. It just
gives you a higher range.''
</P>
<P>
   There's no question that professional voice training can yield
career benefits. But Maggie Mancinelli-Cahill, artistic director of
Capital Repertory Company in Albany, N.Y., wonders whether
conservatory training also yields a sameness of accent and timbre a
lack of regional idiosyncrasy. She likes the unique voices of yore:
Gregory Peck (``a very beautiful voice''), Brando (``he can change
his voice, and is willing to, in so many different roles''), Lionel
Barrymore (``that voice is unmistakable'').
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cary Grants and the Jimmy Stewarts and the Katharine
Hepburns, they were urged to be personalities. They were hired for
their personalities. I'm not so sure that's true any more in
film,'' she said. ``It may be just a question of a voice coming
along as the voice and personality grow and develop.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there's no mistaking Jimmy Stewart (when he) made his
first movie (the voice) was there then! Or Cary Grant: His voice
was there in `Gunga Din.'''
</P>
<P>
   But maybe it's too early to tell. Perhaps, as Tom Cruise's
career progresses, his voice will assume the quirks and quavers of
a truly singular star. Perhaps Chris O'Donnell will sign up for
voice lessons. And perhaps, as the years fly past and filmmaking
enters its second century, the stars of talking pictures will once
again learn to talk.

SEEING WINDOWS 98 CLEARLY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Windows 98 is now available in stores after a long,
bumpy legal and technical road as the successor to Microsoft's
best-selling Windows 95.
</P>
<P>
   But while Windows 95 was an instant hit _ helped along by
Microsoft's relentless marketing push _ Windows 98 has an early
reputation of being less than compelling. And so, the question is
this: Is Windows 98 an important enough upgrade that most users
should plunk down about $100 for it?
</P>
<P>
   The answer depends on what each user requires from his or her
operating system. Windows 98 is not a dramatic change from Windows
95.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have the same architectural design, the same memory
management, the same instabilities at their cores,'' said Ed Bott,
a senior editor at PC Computing magazine who has been studying
Windows 98.
</P>
<P>
   If you are a big Internet user, Windows 98 can make your time
online a lot easier, Bott said. ``It's obvious who wouldn't need
it, and that's those who neither want nor need Internet access. For
those people it will just be a royal pain.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Windows 98 is essentially Windows 95 with a prettier
face, it has some other features that make it easier to maintain,
troubleshoot and upgrade a personal computer. There are performance
enhancements that may or may not speed up your system, and there
are numerous bug fixes, though many of them already are available
through patches for Windows 95.
</P>
<P>
   If you've got the latest version of Windows 95 _ dubbed OSR2 _
you have many of the improvements in Windows 98. If you've got
Internet Explorer 4 on your system and during installation you
agreed to the ``desktop update,'' then you already have most of the
interface improvements.
</P>
<P>
   But Karen Akers, a Microsoft product manager for Windows 98,
said that the integration of Internet Explorer 4 into the operating
system makes it snappier and more stable than the Windows 95
combination.
</P>
<P>
   Akers also argues that the maintenance features and
troubleshooting utilities alone are worth the price of admission.
</P>
<P>
   As with Windows 95, the new operating system will be available
in two versions. One is designed to be used with computers that
already have Windows 3.1 or 95 on them; it has a list price of
$109. The other version is for use on computers that don't have an
operating system installed; it will sell for about twice that
figure.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
INTERFACE CHANGES &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you've been watching the news, you know that the Department
of Justice is not pleased with Microsoft's integration of its Web
browser into the operating system. Justice's concern is that making
Internet Explorer 4 one of the core features of Windows will spell
death for the external browser market _ primarily Netscape
Communications.
</P>
<P>
   It certainly is convenient. With the browser doubling as the
desktop, any folder window can double as a Web browser. For
example, open folders can be set to include a field that lets you
type in a Web address. One minute the window can be showing the
contents of your hard drive, and the next it's displaying a page on
the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, folders themselves can be displayed as Web pages,
complete with background images and additional text. Windows uses
this capability to display basic information about each file _ just
hold your cursor over a file and its size, date and name will show
up on the left side of the window. There are some folder features
that are unique to Windows 98. Some graphics files _ such as GIF,
JPG and BMP files _ can be displayed in thumbnail style in the same
area where you'd see file information, again just by holding your
cursor over a file.
</P>
<P>
   How you launch programs and choose files is different if you
turn on the one-click option. Windows 98 and Internet Explorer 4
both let you start programs by clicking on them once with the left
mouse button, much the way you'd single-click on a Web address to
get to that page. Selecting a file is even simpler _ just hold your
cursor over the file's icon.
</P>
<P>
   While this is handy, it can also be confusing if you're a
longtime Windows 3.1 or 95 user. Single-clicking in those operating
systems is used to select a file, while double-clicking launches
it.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
MAINTENANCE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Windows 98 includes the Maintenance Wizard, which automates the
process of checking and defragmenting hard drives, removing
temporary files and removing programs that launch at startup.
</P>
<P>
   The Wizard changes the way Windows 98's defragmenting utility
works. Normally, a defragmenter packs all the files on a drive
tightly together. This is done regardless of whether a series of
files is related. Corel's WordPerfect 8, for example, is made up of
hundreds of files, but in the past the defragmentation process did
not place them next to each other. Windows 98 places related files
side-by-side, and puts the files you use most on the fastest part
of the hard drive. This means the drive's read head doesn't have to
travel as far to pick up the files needed to get a program started.
</P>
<P>
   But how does Windows 98 know what programs you use most often,
and what files make up what programs? The operating system keeps a
log of what's launched. The Maintenance Wizard uses this as a kind
of map for the defragmentation process.
</P>
<P>
   Another nice under-the-hood feature is FAT32, a new way that
Windows organizes files on the hard drive. FAT32 cuts down on the
amount disk space required for each file on a large hard drive.
Converting to it can result in disk space savings of as much as 40
percent.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(MORE) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Although the OSR2 version of Windows 95 came with FAT32, many PC
makers still ship systems using the old file system, FAT16. There
is no Windows 95 conversion utility, so users who want to take
advantage of the feature must use a third-party program, such as
Partition Magic from PowerQuest.
</P>
<P>
   Windows 98 comes with a FAT16-to-FAT32 converter. Once you've
made the change, there's no way to reverse it, though, unless you
use something like Partition Magic.
</P>
<P>
   Windows Upgrade is an Internet-based service that alerts you to
new features and bug fixes that can be downloaded from a Microsoft
Web site. This feature can be activated when you are away from the
PC, or even overnight.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
TROUBLESHOOTING &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Don't think you'll get away from General Protection Faults,
illegal operation errors or even random lockups _ it's still
Windows, after all. But you have more tools with Windows 98 to help
you figure out what's causing all that pain.
</P>
<P>
   One of the nicest tools is an oldie-but-goodie: Dr. Watson. The
utility found in Windows 3.1 and Windows for Workgroups 3.11 is
back. Just run Dr. Watson in the background when working with a
program that keeps crashing, and Dr. Watson will generate a log
with detailed information about the state of your system at the
time of the crash.
</P>
<P>
   You'll still see the Windows 95-style error box, and be able to
read the details from there. But Dr. Watson provides even more
information, which can be very useful when dealing with technical
support staff.
</P>
<P>
   Many troubleshooting features are packed into a single utility
with the misleading name of System Information. This program is
like a Swiss army knife, packed full of useful tools for poking
around in the guts of your machine. Among its many ``blades'' are:
</P>
<P>
   _ Incredibly detailed system information for hardware, software,
memory configuration and network settings. If it's happening on
your computer, you'll find it listed here.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Windows Report Tool, which gathers this information and
combines it with user notes for dispatch to technical support
personnel.
</P>
<P>
   _ The System File Checker, which scans for missing or corrupted
operating system files. If it finds one, it first searches for the
file on your hard drives, and then gives you the option of
extracting one from your Windows 98 setup disk.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Registry Checker, which scans the Windows Registry for
errors. If it finds one, it suggests a fix. It will also prompt you
to back up the Registry.
</P>
<P>
   _ The System Configuration Utility _ one of the most exciting
components. It lets you select which parts of your various
configuration files _ AUTOEXEC.BAT, CONFIG.SYS, WIN.INI and
SYSTEM.INI _ will be launched when Windows 98 boots. Rather than
calling up these files in SYSEDIT, or in a word processor, you just
click on the parts you don't want to run. This makes
troubleshooting a breeze.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Skip Driver Agent, which checks for drivers that gave
Windows 98 problems during the booting process. You can then
disable or reinstall them.
</P>
<P>
   As with Windows 95, Windows 98 has you create a startup disk to
be used for troubleshooting. Unlike Windows 95, this one's actually
useful. It includes a generic CD-ROM driver that lets you reinstall
Windows 98 from the CD without having the entire operating system
present. However, be sure and test the disk to make sure it works
after you've installed Windows 98. If the generic driver doesn't
work with your CD-ROM drive, you'll need to replace it with drivers
specific to your unit.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
HARDWARE SUPPORT &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One of Windows 98's most-touted features is its ability to work
with TV-tuner cards, which allow you to hook up cable and view
programs on your PC. However, it ships with drivers for only the
ATI Technologies cards. Others reportedly are on the way.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has included WebTV for Windows 98 software, which has
two main features. The first is an onscreen TV listing that
downloads information at no cost and lets you create your own local
viewing schedule. You can search for the kinds of movies you like _
say, horror films _ and get a listing of everything in that genre
showing for the week.
</P>
<P>
   WebTV for Windows also will display extra information
transmitted by a broadcaster about a particular show. For example,
some television programs offer biographic information about stars
as a show airs. This appears in a window alongside the TV display.
</P>
<P>
   Windows 98 also has built-in support for Universal Serial Bus
ports and devices, which are faster and, unlike serial ports,
support plug and play. Windows 95 OSR2 has this as well, but it's
an add-on. In theory, USB support works better in Windows 98, but
keep in mind that it was a USB scanner that caused a late beta
version of Windows 98 to crash during a now-infamous trade show
demo by Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates.
</P>
<P>
   There's also built-in support for DVD-ROM drives.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Windows 98 has built-in support for Firewire, also
known as 1394, a connection used to link home entertainment devices
to personal computers. A Firewire-capable VCR, for example, might
be able to talk to WebTV for Windows, allowing you to program the
VCR via the computer.

THIS SONG OF THE OPEN ROAD IS A DIESEL VOLUNTARY

 (l and f coding)  
 (For release Sunday, June 28 1998)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN R.WHITE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What does an automotive columnist who drives constantly for a
living do on vacation?
</P>
<P>
   A) Lock the garage and hide.
</P>
<P>
   B) Pitch a tent on an uninhabited island.
</P>
<P>
   C) Enter a couple of stock car races.
</P>
<P>
   D) Become a cross-country truck driver.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
---- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The answer to the above came in a telephone call from the museum
director.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've decided to take the car to Colorado after all.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How will you get it there?''
</P>
<P>
   ``With our new trailer, of course.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Pulled by ...?''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Dodge diesel that Chrysler lent us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I understand that, but pulled by who? Who's driving?''
</P>
<P>
   A silent pause ensues, followed by: ``Well ... I'm flying out.
... Expectant pause.
</P>
<P>
   Which is how D) became the answer to the original question.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
---- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The car to be taken is a 1910 Model 70 Stanley Steamer owned by
the Stanley Museum, Kingfield, Maine _ the museum is the ``us'' to
whom Chrysler has given the use of a truck for the summer. The
destination is the new branch of the Stanley Museum at the Stanley
Hotel in Estes Park, Colo. The reason the Model 70 is being shipped
there is not to add to the artifacts on display but to participate
in a ``steam tour'' organized to celebrate the dedication of the
new branch museum. The artifact being preserved in this case is the
steam automotive technology rather than the steam car itself.
</P>
<P>
   You see, in 1909, F.O. Stamley, twin of F.E. who invented the
Stanley car (and a lot of other stuff), having found the Colorado
mountain clime conducive to restoring his health, built this
massive hotel _ and most of the rest of what made Estes Park tick:
bank, power company, clinic, roads, etc. That, in a nutshell, is
why there is a branch of a Maine museum in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   The ``who'' of all this, you realize, is the columnist who,
equipped with a jar of peanut butter, a half-gallon of lemonade, a
loaf of bread, a kitchen knife, a blanket, a pillow, and an AAA
Road Atlas, set forth in a Dodge Ram diesel behemoth towing an
enclosed trailer, destination Estes Park some 2,400 give-or-take
miles distant. This is what becomes of being a museum
``volunteer.'' I had always wanted a long run in a diesel Dodge; I
had always wanted a cross-country road trip _ but not necessarily
together and not this badly.
</P>
<P>
   The truck is a beauty, a big red Dodge Ram 2500 with a 24-valve
Cummins diesel throbbing under the hood. The beauty, however, has
been specced (pronounced specked, meaning ordered with specific
equipment) by a teenager. The museum requested an expanded cab
model; this is a regular cab _ my gear is going into the trailer.
Museum asked for 2WD model with automatic; Big Red is 4WD with a
5-speed manual. The 16-inch chrome wheels look puny, out of place
on this monster _ but, it has a CD player.
</P>
<P>
   Day One: The truck has been prepared with auxiliary brake
control for the 22-foot-long-only-God-knows-how-tall Haulmark
trailer and said trailer loaded with steamer, tools, spare parts,
tires, pilot fuel, etc., by the heavy-lifting volunteers of the
Maine museum. Glenn Byron briefs me on the operation of the brake
auxiliary.
</P>
<P>
   Some 15 seconds into the trip, I realize that the dual power
mirrors on this truck, though large indeed, are useless for seeing
around a trailer since they don't extend far enough. This becomes
an acute consideration when I miss a turn off Maine's Route 4 and
find myself on a road to nowhere with no option for reversing
direction other than to pull into a driveway and back out.
</P>
<P>
   I pick the wrong driveway, soon find myself sliding toward A) an
embankment and B) a car as the back wheels slip on loose gravel.
Suddenly, I am extremely grateful for the 4WD as I slip the
transfer case into the 4WD-low range mode. The front wheels grab,
the Ram inches the trailer rerarward, bending it toward the highway
_ a woman appears in the window of the house that goes with the
driveway. I smile broadly, wave as if I knew her. That trailer is a
22-foot billboard for the Stanley Museum; I hope she's friendly and
has a sense of humor. She smiles. I'm on the road again. That
evening, I pull into my own driveway; I have covered a mere 151.6
miles. Four days hence, I must be in Estes Park.
</P>
<P>
   Day Two: Before going anywhere, I start hunting bigger mirrors.
A Dodge dealer can supply extended mirrors suitable for a trailer,
but that sacrifices the power option for manual operation _ plus
they cost around $180, and it will take a day or two to get them. I
opt to hit the road with a couple of add-ons from U-Haul attached
by an ingenious clamp that's mainly heavy rubber straps _ less than
$25. Not perfect, but they add that extra measure of visibility and
safety.
</P>
<P>
   I decide to head west on Interstate 90, a well patrolled toll
road through Massachusetts and New York, rather than head through
Pennsylvania for Interstate 80. In Ohio, I'll take I-71 southwest
to I-70 west toward Denver. Compared to the museum's old trailer,
the Trailer from Hell, the new double-axle Haulmark is a thing of
beauty and a joy on the road. Relativelty speaking. There isn't
much joy as the wind picks up blowing broadside.
</P>
<P>
   The Ram has extra sound-deadening to muffle the diesel rattle
and rumble; you might as well be trying to muffle a rock concert.
But, when you settle into the 2,000 rpm groove and coast along in
overdrive at 65, that rumbly rattle is a comfort. The seat in this
thing is very good, offering good back support, thigh comfort. I
stop now and then to stretch, to refill the 34-gallon fuel tank, to
take care of other ncessities of the road. At a rest stop near
Rochester, N.Y., I decide I've about had enough for the day, find a
quiet spot to park the rig, clear the bench seat, break out the
blanket and pillow. There is almost room enough to stretch out full
length. Almost. Still it is comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   It has been a 447-mile day. Only 598.7 miles of this trip have
been accomplished leaving a long road ahead. It will prove to be an
interesting road. You're welcome to ride along again in next week's
column.

INFINITI DOES A LITTLE BETTER WITH LATEST G20 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN R. WHITE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Infiniti showed off its latest generation entry-level luxury car
this week, choosing the grandeur of Boston's Museum of
Transportation as the setting for its newest jewel, the 1999 G20.
The G20 has, in past incarnations, been among this columnist's
least favorite cars. That may change.
</P>
<P>
   For openers, the new G20 has a real back seat, a bench that will
accommodate real people with real knees who wish to sit upright.
We're talking knee room with the front seat fully extended to the
rear, not what you might get if the driver were a midget. In
keeping with the added rear room is added rear entry room, a larger
door opening.
</P>
<P>
   I dwell on the rear accommodation because it was the back of the
G20 that most distressed in previous editions. The cramped rear, in
concert with a stiff suspension _ in the rear, bordering on vicious
one year _ that made one wonder why anyone would part with luxury
money for that very un-luxury cabin.
</P>
<P>
   The new G20 suspension is still an unknown on the road, at least
unknown to me, but Nissan, the mother company to Infiniti, claims
great strides forward. It is obvious that great strides have been
undertaken in several departments.
</P>
<P>
   The new G20 looks like an Infiniti for a change instead of an
overweight Sentra. There is a grace to the shape, a logic to the
interior layout, and styling allure front and rear. The current
edition is based upon a European model, the Primera, Infiniti says,
and is available in standard and touring variants. A
140-horsepower, 2.0-liter, 16-valve 4-cylinder supplies the power
delivering it through either a 5-speed, manual gearbox or a
4-speed, electronically controlled, automatic transaxle. The new
model comes with side air bags for safety and a Bose sound system
for your soul.
</P>
<P>
   Infiniti is pinning high hopes on the front-drive G20, aiming
for US sales of 18,000 units, a considerable leap over the
13,000-plus sales last achieved by G20 and somewhat higher than the
peak annual sales total of 17,300-plus. It's aimed at the youthful
driver, Infiniti says, and it seemed to awaken the youth in more
than one of us among the New England Motor Press Association on
hand for the unveiling. A full-scale road test is in the works.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   General Motors continues to carom away from common sense. Since
last we left GM, the company, having convinced a corps of Wall
Street analysts that profits were continuing up and boosted
short-term sales results with coupons and incentives, has provoked
a crippling strike, blamed it on the employees, announced drastic
cash conservation programs, initiated moves to create another layer
of management, signed a deal to build trucks and sport/utilities in
China, intimated to its employees that it is ``losing $50 million a
year,'' and announced a Cadillac 2-seat roadster.
</P>
<P>
   GM, after lengthy bickering in Flint, moved dies out of a
stamping plant over a weekend, thus fueling union suspicions that
the company intended to move the Flint operation to Mexico, thus
provoking a walkout. The Flint shutdown was the first in a chain of
dominoes that have virtually crippled GM production and threatened
new-model introductions.
</P>
<P>
   True to form, while demanding new work rules and blue-collar
reductions, the General has come up with still another
management-fattener: GM will promote its brand managers to
positions of authority heretofore reserved for the division
managers and move division managers aside _ at least that's the
picture offered in the trade press. ``Brand management'' is the
buzzword these days, so it was only a matter of time until GM's
recruits from the ranks of diapers and cookies be elevated. This,
you may recall, is a company that while nearly halving its market
share and reducing its blue-collar work force, has added another
division _ read that as added management.
</P>
<P>
   While denying any intention to move Flint work to Mexico, GM has
signed an agreement with the world's lowest-wage country, China, to
build light trucks and SUVs _ that's in addition to the agreement
to build Buick Regals there, a car for which every Chinese over 16
lusts, right?
</P>
<P>
   I do recall some years back when GM's Bob Stempel, briefly the
CEO after Roger Smith retired, denied that Buick production had
been moved to Mexico, then explained that all 50,000 Mexican-built
A-body cars (which he had just told me weren't made in Mexico) were
bought by Mexicans. Yes, an economy that at the time barely
supported 400,000 car sales annually suddenly snapped up an
additional 50,000 new cars. Strangely, though, everybody else in
that Washington, D.C., room believed him!
</P>
<P>
   If you dial into the GM propaganda line _ 800-546-0709 _ you can
hear the GM litany for yourself and learn how the company is
instigating unprecedented ``cold shutdowns'' to avoid utility bills
in idle plants, is losing $50 million a year (presumably at Flint),
is in a crisis mode to conserve cash. And it's all the union's
fault. I hope those analysts spin that dial.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Cadillac 2-seater is to get a Northstar V-8
engine, be heavier and shorter than a Corvette, be shown ``with
production intent'' at the Paris auto show, and be a competitor for
such as Mercedes _ assuming GM doesn't melt down first. Maybe they
could call it Allante. Remember that Cadillac 2-seater? It took the
world by yawn and was killed as soon as GM got it right. General,
if you would survive, it is time to start trimming management,
jettison a few excess divisions, and stop beating up on the labor
force. Maybe if you listened more to the men and women who build
the cars instead of the accountants who cheapen them, the market
slide might slow down. Or maybe even turn around. It worked for
Ford.

 &HT;    HIGH COURT SAYS BOCA CAN BE LIABLE FOR LIFEGUARD'S SEXUAL
HARASSMENT
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In landmark rulings Friday, the Supreme Court made
it easier for employees to hold their employers liable for sexual
harassment committed by supervisors or more senior managers.
</P>
<P>
   The court's position was spelled out in two separate 7-2
decisions, with Justices Clarence Thomas and Antonin Scalia
dissenting.
</P>
<P>
   One of the cases involved claims that the city of Boca Raton,
Fla., is liable for the sexual harassment of a former female
lifeguard by two of her superiors. The other case involved an
Illinois woman who sued her former employer, Burlington Industries,
over alleged sexual misconduct by her boss's boss .
</P>
<P>
   In the 33-page Boca Raton opinion, written by Justice David
Souter, the high court reversed last year's ruling of the 11th
Circuit Court of Appeals and upheld the $1 damage award granted by
the U.S. District Court to former lifeguard Beth Ann Faragher.
</P>
<P>
   In the Burlington case Kimberly Ellerth, who worked as a
salesperson in a two-person office in Chicago, had sued Burlington
because, she said, she was harassed by the boss of her immediate
supervisor.
</P>
<P>
   The court's ruling had the effect of allowing both lawsuits to
continue.
</P>
<P>
   In issuing the two rulings, the Supreme Court sought to define
the circumstances by which an employer could be held responsible
for sexual harassment committed by managers and supervisors.
</P>
<P>
   The court rejected two extreme positions in the sexual
harassment issue: the theory that employers cannot be held
responsible for the actions of supervisors because their actions
are outside the scope of their employment; and the theory that
employers are automatically responsible for their supervisors'
conduct.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the court found a middle ground which held that
employers are liable for the actions of a supervisor, but that they
can be released from liability depending on the reasonableness of
their anti-harassment efforts as well as the conduct of the victim
in attempting to avoid harassment.
</P>
<P>
   Yolanda Wu, staff attorney for the National Organization for
Women's Legal Defense Fund, said the court had adopted a ``sensible
standard'' that would give employers a ``strong incentive ... to
adopt and enforce anti-harassment policies. Hopefully it will send
a strong signal to employers that they should take it seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   In his dissent, Thomas argued that ``absent an adverse
employment consequence, an employer cannot be held ... liable if a
supervisor creates a hostile work environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas' 1991 confirmation hearing in the U.S. Senate focused
national attention on the issue of sexual harassment in the
workplace when Anita Hill, a former aide at two federal agencies
where they worked, accused him of making sexually suggestive
comments to her. Thomas denied the accusations.
</P>
<P>
   In the Boca Raton case, the court found that city officials
failed to disseminate a 1990 city policy against sexual harassment
to beach employees, failed to keep track of its supervisors'
conduct, and failed to exercise ``reasonable care to prevent the
supervisors' harassing conduct.''
</P>
<P>
   Faragher, who worked as a part-time and summer lifeguard from
1985 to 1990, filed suit in 1992 with another former lifeguard
against supervisors Bill Terry, David Silverman and Robert Gordon.
They alleged that Terry and Silverman improperly touched them and
made lewd and vulgar comments in their presence. Faragher said she
discussed their behavior with Gordon, who did not pass on the
information to higher-ranking city officials.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, U.S. District Judge Shelby Highsmith ordered Terry and
Silverman to pay Faragher a combined $10,500 and Terry to pay the
other lifeguard $37,000. He also ordered the city to pay the women
$1 in damages and about $60,000 in legal costs and other expenses.
</P>
<P>
   An 11th Circuit panel reversed the district court's decision in
1996 and that was upheld in a 7-5 ruling by the full appeals court
last year.
</P>
<P>
   In Friday's ruling, Souter sided with Highsmith's finding that
``the degree of hostility in the work environment rose to the
actionable level and was attributable to Silverman and Terry.''
</P>
<P>
   Souter noted that the two supervisors ``were granted virtually
unchecked authority over their subordinates'' and that Faragher and
her fellow female lifeguards were ``completely isolated from the
city's higher management.''
</P>
<P>
   The high court rejected the appeals court's characterization
that the city ``did not effectively disseminate'' its sexual
harassment policy among beach employees. Instead, Souter agreed
with Highsmith's ``explicit finding of a 'complete failure on the
part of the city to disseminate said policy.' ``
</P>
<P>
   The court also rejected a possible defense by the city that it
should not be held liable because there was no requirement that it
issue an anti-harassment policy between 1985 and 1990, the years
Faragher worked there.
</P>
<P>
   The court noted that rulings by the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission _ for which Thomas worked prior to joining the court _
had called for prevention of sexual harassment since 1980 and the
city had adopted its original anti-harassment policy in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   The court also said there was no reason to consider the merits
of Faragher's efforts to mitigate her damages ``since the ($1)
award to her was solely nominal.''

REALHELP FOR YOUR PC 
</HEADLINE>
   By LONNIE BROWN   
 Lakeland (Fla.) Ledger   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The big red box with white lettering brings to mind the
packaging of an aspirin product. Maybe that's because above the
software title, Realhelp, has the words ``extra strength'' written
above it and the phrase ``instantly cures PC headaches'' below it.
It also proposes to: diagnose and fix problems, prevent crashes,
provide virus protection, and update software over the Internet
with its TuneUp technology.
</P>
<P>
   Okay, I'll take two now and call you in the morning. Maybe I can
get rid of this headache that keeps popping up every time my
computer starts.
</P>
<P>
   It was a worrisome little habit that my computer had developed:
Sometimes, a box would pop up on start up labeled ``sage.exe,''
saying the program has caused a problem. The box wouldn't go away,
so I would drag it off the screen and go about my business. It was
hardly a headache, but more of a pain.
</P>
<P>
   Can Realhelp find the problem?
</P>
<P>
   It did. As it turned out, that was not the end of the journey,
but the beginning of it. It found much more than I bargained for.
Some of its discoveries I judged important enough to take care of.
It discovered some missing files for two or three programs.
Reinstalling them corrected that problem. So did locating a file
that was ``missing,'' but actually was only missing from the
directory in which it should have been. It was on the hard disk.
Relocating it to its proper home solved that problem.
</P>
<P>
   Some things Realhelp found, I ignored. Shortcuts, for instance,
that were around long after the program had been removed from the
hard drive are a nuisance, but they can be dealt with anytime.
</P>
<P>
   Realhelp managed to find some other odds and ends that it
considered problems. But as long as they weren't causing me
trouble, I decided to leave well enough alone.
</P>
<P>
   Realhelp from Quarterdeck is the umbrella title for a collection
of programs designed to track down lost files (the problem that
generated the ``sage.exe'' message), unused shortcuts and conflicts
between programs.
</P>
<P>
   It also runs in the background during a computing session,
keeping track of how much of a system's resource is still
available. If the system crashes, Realhelp attempts to find the
problem and correct it, and allows the data to be saved.
</P>
<P>
   It has a virus scan and repair program and monitors the hard
drive for errors that could cause problems down the road. It can
create a bootable emergency disk and find conflicts between
software.
</P>
<P>
   The Extra Strength version of the software includes a free, one
year subscription to TuneUp, an Internet service. In connection
with it, Realhelp profiles a user's computer, then determines if
new patches, updates or service packs are available for
downloading. In case users need to contact software companies, a
list of suppliers and toll-free numbers, if available, are shown
on-screen.
</P>
<P>
   Realhelp comes in two versions: Regular Strength, with a street
price of about $35-$40, and Extra Strength ($55-$60), which
includes a six-month subscription to the online TuneUp service.
</P>
<P>
   PINBALL TALES
</P>
<P>
   Pinball games for the computer aren't just pinball games. For
some reason, they have to have story lines to them.
</P>
<P>
   For those of us who think of a pinball machine as something that
stood in a dark corner of a bar or restaurant, what's to story
line? A plunger propels a chrome ball to the top of a slanted
board, gravity rolls it toward a gapping hole in the bottom,
flippers and a player with luck and skill tries to keep the ball in
play. End of story.
</P>
<P>
   Not any more.
</P>
<P>
   Timeshock from Empire Interactive involves four pinball tables
representing four different time zones: Present day is represented
by Mount Rushmore, and the pinball player must scale it by going
over ramps and hitting drop targets. Ancient Rome, complete with
chariot racing, is another time zone. Dinosaurs are found on the
prehistoric table, robots on the table representing the future. On
each table, players try to collect one fourth of a shattered time
crystal to win the game.
</P>
<P>
   The storyline doesn't matter much. Smooth scrolling graphics and
realistic ball movement are the things that can make or break a
computerized pinball game. Timeshock works well in both those
areas.
</P>
<P>
   The game has settings for four skill levels ranging from novice
(which only gives the player one ball, but assures two minutes of
game play) to Tournament (which turns off the ``extra ball''
feature so all players have the same chances during a game).
</P>
<P>
   The program is available for Windows-based computers and was
recently released for the PlayStation game console. It is the first
entry into the console market for Empire.
</P>
<P>
   If you're new to the pinball-on-computer games and like the
idea, Epic Megagames (1-800-972-7434) has a nice collection of such
programs for DOS and Windows operating systems.

&HT;        ATMOSPHERE SAFE FROM FLORIDA FIRES BUT LUNGS BEWARE
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Mark D. Preston  
 &HT;    c. 1998 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, June 26 -- Florida's air quality has reached
critically dangerous levels, but scientists agree the state's
out-of-control wildfires -- which are scorching the landscape --
pose no long-term threat to the earth's atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Herman, a NASA atmospheric scientist stationed at Goddard
Space Flight Center in Maryland, said the smoke and pollution
produced by the fires will have no effect on the atmosphere. Herman
analyzes ozone, smoke, dust, volcanic ash and pollution from data
collected by a NASA satellite.
</P>
<P>
   ``The (wildfires) are not small to people who live in Florida,
but they are small compared to the amount of smoke needed to have a
negative effect on the atmosphere,'' Herman said. ``For the most
part, this smoke system is very small in relation to the total
atmosphere.''
</P>
<P>
   Herman said large-scale fires ignited intentionally by cattle
ranchers and miners in Africa and South America are a much bigger
concern for atmospheric scientists than the Florida fires because
some of those fires burn for as long as four months.
</P>
<P>
   But while the atmosphere is not suffering from the smoke and
pollution, Florida residents afflicted with respiratory problems
will be subject to an array of health problems. Especially hard hit
are the elderly, children and people with asthma and emphysema.
</P>
<P>
   ``Essentially, what you've got is something similar to a lot of
cars running around without catalytic converters,'' said Hal
Maring, a research professor at the University of Miami's Division
of Marine and Atmospheric Chemistry.
</P>
<P>
   Maring said people living downwind of smoke and ash from the
wildfires are experiencing what Los Angeles residents suffered
during the smog-filled days of the 1970s. But Maring said the smoke
should be short term because Florida is a relatively flat
peninsula, while Los Angeles is situated in a basin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Florida winds are predominantly east to west, and the stuff
will eventually be blown out to sea,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Green, a graduate research professor at the University of
Florida's College of Engineering who is working on energy and
environmental issues, said the wildfire's smoke is similar to
second-hand cigarette smoke. Green said a few storms should clean
the air.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald White, director of National Programs for the American
Lung Association, said the very small particulates released from
the burning wood and vegetation can penetrate deep into lungs,
causing an array of health problems.
</P>
<P>
   White said the elderly, young children and people with chronic
breathing problems should stay indoors as much as possible until
the air becomes clean again.
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, staying indoors only filters out 20 percent to 30
percent of the pollution. Since particulates act more like a gas
than a solid, they are able to pass through walls, he said.

   CHINA-SUMMIT (Beijing) _ President Clinton was formally received
by President Jiang Zemin on Saturday in a somber military ceremony
on Tiananmen Square, the vast tombstone of a failed revolution. He

Clinton and Jiang then inspected army troops and reviewed an honor

   KOSOVO (Pristina, Serbia) _ Belgrade has ordered its military
and special police to mount widescale attacks in Kosovo to
recapture pockets held by ethnic Albanian rebels and reopen roads
the separatist rebels have blocked for weeks, Western diplomats and
military officials said Friday. The escalation of the fight against
the rebels came as Richard C. Holbrooke, the U.S. special envoy,

   NIRELAND-ELECT (Belfast, Northern Ireland) _ Parties committed

parties, the Ulster Unionist Party of David Trimble and the Social
Democratic and Labor Party of John Hume, would get the chance to
fulfill their historic pledge to work together to end the sectarian
conflict. But the ongoing count of the ballots from Thursday's

   Teacher's Furry Pets: Every Dog Has His Day (Care)
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Ted loves nursery school. He looks forward to
flirting with his girlfriend, who likes to wear a pink cape, and
enjoys being read to while sitting with his best friend. Typical
kid stuff _ except that Ted is a Yorkshire terrier; his gal pal,
Tinkerbell, is a white Maltese, and his best buddy, Huggy Bear, is
a standard poodle.
</P>
<P>
   They all attend nursery school at Doggy Do and Pussycats, Too,
at 567 Third Ave. (near 37th Street). It is one of a dozen pet
day-care centers that have opened in New York in an era of latchkey
pets, when guilty masters are no longer content just to hire a
walker. Instead, they want some stimulating recreational
activities.
</P>
<P>
   For $30 a day, Doggy Do's canine nursery school offers story
hour, snack time, nap time and crafts. (Last week's project was
Father's Day cards.)
</P>
<P>
   Admission to the schools can be very competitive, said Larry
Roth, an owner of Doggy Do. ``Like the way parents are frenzied
about what exclusive nursery school their child will get into, it's
the same for us,'' he said. ``People vie to get their dogs in
during the day, and the dogs are cliquish on the street.''
</P>
<P>
   Allure magazine fashion editor Kelly Delaney, who is Ted's
owner, marvels at the schoolyard dynamics. ``The parents don't
really know each other that well, but Ted went nuts on the street
last week when he ran into Huggy Bear,'' she said. ``I even know
which dogs are mean to mine. I caught myself checking out Jesse's
mother the other day and thinking, `So that's Jesse's mom.'''
</P>
<P>
   Scoring Jerseys
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ World Cup fever is adding color to the closets of New
Yorkers. Fans are heading to Soccer Sport Supply Co., 1745 First
Ave. (near 90th Street), one of the few places where they can find
the jerseys of all 32 teams in the tournament; they are $58.95
each.
</P>
<P>
   Teams like Brazil, Italy and the United States account for most
sales, but jerseys from underdog teams with winning designs are
also moving in record volume, said Jeffrey and Herman Doss,
brothers and owners of the store.
</P>
<P>
   Among the hottest sellers: Morocco's bright red shirt with green
stripe; South Africa's white, gold and green shirt, and Jamaica's
gold jersey emblazoned with a crescent moon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Jamaican jersey was a beautiful design and we had all the
reggae boys coming in to buy it,'' Scott Davidson, a salesman,
said. ``We have every ethnicity buying our shirts. You should see
this place on a busy day. Everybody's ribbing each other.'' So far,
no fan brawls.
</P>
<P>
   Must-Hear TV &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Ready for the post-MTV age? Music Choice, a cable
television service that recently arrived in select neighborhoods in
New York, provides customers with 24 hours of commercial-free music
programming the old-fashioned way _ without pictures.
</P>
<P>
   With a click of the remote control, a menu appears on screen
listing 31 music channels to choose from: 1970s Super Hits, Big
Bands, Classical, Musica Latina, Jazz, Lite Jazz, Contemporary
Christian.
</P>
<P>
   Subscribers of Music Choice praise it for offering song
rotations, as on radio or music-television, but without commercial
blocks, deejays, veejays or the need to wait to learn a song's
credits. As each song plays, a simple black screen displays the
title, artist, label and an 800 number to order the CD.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like MTV, but you're not forced to watch
hygiene-challenged rockers,'' A.J. Jacobs, a writer at
Entertainment Weekly, said as he watched (oops _ listened to)
``Please Send Me Some Love'' by Dinah Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs ``pops it on'' when he has a friend over or is
``puttering around the house.'' Why not queue up a CD? ``I like the
glow of the TV,'' he said. ``It makes me happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Mallets Swing Again

   NEW YORK _ Move over, Big Bertha. This summer's swingers are
grabbing croquet mallets. The genteel pastime is making a comeback.
When choosing a set of painted woods, it's the dustier, the better.
Players are combing antique shops for vintage sets.
</P>
<P>
   ``A croquet set allows this fantasy where I'm sipping iced tea
on the rolling front lawn of a beautiful estate,'' said Lou Sagar,
the owner of Zona at 97 Greene St. (Spring Street), which sells
sets for about $200.
</P>
<P>
   Marcello Soriano, an owner of the Lively Set, an antique shop at
33 Bedford Street, is swamped with requests for croquet gear from
those who crave a Gatsby ethos.
</P>
<P>
   ``A collection of croquet balls in a metal basket or a mallet
hanging on the wall is an extremely popular look,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Insiders Scream For This Cream
</P>
<P>
   Yon-Ka skin-care products are hard to get. Once available only
at destination spas like Spa Internazionale on Fisher Island in
Florida and Gurney's Inn in Montauk, N.Y., the pricey French line
(average product cost, $28) can now be found in Manhattan at the
Bliss Spa, the Paul Labreque Salon at the Reebok Club and a handful
of other day spas. But buying Yon-Ka is still a challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Because the line of 58 all-natural products is so complex and
custom-tailored, the company recommends that before making a
purchase, customers get a treatment or consultation from a licensed
esthetician, who can suggest a regimen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get bombarded daily with product lines that want to be used
at the spa; I chose Yon-Ka,'' Regina Viotto, the director at Paul
Labreque, said. ``The products are so pure and complex and meet
very specific needs.'' For those who have trouble remembering if
the Optimizer cream is applied with or without the Phyto Contour,
there is a Yon-Ka help line: (800) 533-6276.

A WARMING TREND FOR CANADIAN STOCKS? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, June 28)  
(lb) 
 By SANA SIWOLOP   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Start with a strong, rebounding economy. Add an apparently
undervalued stock market. Throw in a national currency that seems
to have been pummeled by one arctic blast after another.
</P>
<P>
   To many investors, that sounds like a recipe for bargains. And
it explains why many are hungrily watching the Canadian stock
market.
</P>
<P>
   The mere mention of Canada, though, can stop some otherwise
eager American investors cold. Over the years, the nation to the
north has produced enough seedy mining companies and dubious oil
stocks to fill the St. Lawrence Seaway. Its smaller stock exchanges
have reputations for lax regulation and even slacker enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   And deep frustration can await an investor who tries to get the
same kind of detailed information about a Canadian company that is
readily available about companies whose stocks are traded in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   But many analysts see in Canada something hard to find in the
United States: plenty of upside potential.
</P>
<P>
   Canada's domestic economy could hardly look more promising.
Growth is strong, inflation is low and upward pressure on wages is
almost nonexistent. And the weakness of the Canadian dollar is
bolstering the country's exports. They will soon account for half
the country's total output.
</P>
<P>
   Still, valuations of Canadian stocks have lately lagged behind
those of their American cousins. According to Fred Sturm, portfolio
manager of the Ivy Canada mutual fund, business prospects for
companies in sectors other than natural resources, Canada's
traditional strength, are still attractive, but their stocks are
currently trading at levels 10 percent to 20 percent below those of
their south-of-the-border counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   And because Canada's commodities businesses depend heavily on
exports, now depressed by the disruptions in Asian economies,
Canadian natural-resource stocks are even cheaper, trading at
discounts of 20 percent to 30 percent to similar American stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian stocks generally would be more appealing to Joseph
Scarella, a portfolio manager at Oppenheimer Capital, if he could
see a ``spikelike bottoming'' in commodity prices in three to six
months. Those prices are low because of worldwide oversupply as
well as the Asian situation. But he said improvement would be
gradual.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Root, who works at Goldman, Sachs as an analyst of paper
and forest-product companies, likes Donohue, Domtar and MacMillan
Bloedel, Canadian companies in that field. But he said he did not
expect their stock prices to crawl out of their trough ``until the
market gets its hands around the situation in Asia.''
</P>
<P>
   Sturm, whose Ivy Canada is one of the few Canadian-oriented
mutual funds available to American investors, says low commodity
prices have created a buying opportunity. He reasons that
commodities have nowhere to go but up and that when they do,
Canadian natural-resource companies can be expected to outperform
the broader market, as they have in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Chandler of Goldman, Sachs Canada pointed out that the
weakness of Canada's currency had helped to offset the damage from
the commodity slump, keeping Canadian output competitively priced.
</P>
<P>
   Because of strong prospects for the overall Canadian economy,
Chandler said he expects Canadian stocks to return about 10 percent
over the next 12 months, just as they have over the last 12. Such a
steady pace may not look like much compared with the 28 percent
run-up of the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index in the past year, but it
could be soothing to investors who worry that the U.S. market is
due for a meltdown.
</P>
<P>
   There are signs that profits for Canadian companies have not yet
peaked. For the first quarter of 1998, they accounted for just 8.9
percent of Canada's national income. ``That tells us that corporate
profits aren't yet overextended,'' Chandler said. ``The historical
average is closer to 10 percent.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   One way for cautious investors to play the Canadian stock market
is to invest in companies that generate a high percentage of their
revenue outside Canada. Robert Reiner, who helps manage the BT
Investment International Equity fund, sees that advantage in three
of his four favorite Canadian stocks.
</P>
<P>
   BCE, the parent of Bell Canada, is one of the few big
telecommunications companies that also has a well-situated interest
in the telephone equipment industry, which is booming worldwide.
Cadillac Fairview, which owns and develops commercial real estate,
has almost a fifth of its assets in the United States, something
that he suspects most investors haven't noticed.
</P>
<P>
   Newcourt Credit is currently Reiner's top pick. The company
arranges asset-based financing for large companies and
institutions, most of them outside Canada, and is the biggest pure
play within its respective market, which is led by GE Capital,
Reiner said. He expects Newcourt's earnings to grow 50 percent next
year, yet the company's stock is trading at just 23.6 times its
estimated 1999 earnings.
</P>
<P>
   His fourth recommendation, the Royal Bank of Canada, is somewhat
surprising. Canadian bank stocks have run way up recently, posting
much bigger gains than the S&AMP;P banking index showed this year and
last, and some investors might feel edgy parking money in the
sector.
</P>
<P>
   But the Royal Bank is a leader in consolidating and has a
pending merger with the Bank of Montreal. And unlike banks in the
United States, Canada's dominate the domestic mutual-fund industry,
which is just taking off with consumers.
</P>
<P>
   According to Lori Appelbaum, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs,
Canadian bank stocks are trading at a 10 percent to 15 percent
discount to those of their American counterparts, even though
expected earnings growth is just as strong, at 12 percent to 13
percent annually. She likes Canadian Imperial Bank and Toronto
Dominion as well as Royal.
</P>
<P>
   But there are two clouds on the horizon for Canadian bank
stocks, according to Scarella at Oppenheimer Capital, and they both
emanate from the Bank of Canada, the country's central bank.
Interest rates could be raised to stem the slide of the currency,
and there could be a move to block the Royal Bank-Bank of Montreal
merger.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this merger has only a 50-50 chance of happening,''
Scarella said. ``There's a lot of momentum building up against it,
especially among rural Canadians who think it will cause banks to
close up offices.''
</P>
<P>
   But money managers like Reiner remain bullish. ``There's this
bias that all you can buy in Canada are commodity stocks, when in
fact the country has some of the best banks, industrials and
technology companies in the world,'' he said. ``There are a lot of
overlooked stocks in Canada, and for the most part, U.S.
mutual-fund managers still haven't discovered them.''

SCENT OF A MAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, June 28) 
(th) 
 By FRANK DeCARO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   This stinks.
</P>
<P>
   The designer fragrance that has been my signature scent for
seven years _ my personal olfactory statement for the '90s _ has
been discontinued. I got wind of this tragic bit of fragrance news
when I tried to buy a bottle of Romeo Gigli per Uomo a week and a
half ago in the Italian designer's boutique in Milan. The clerk,
while cheerful and knowledgeable, could not produce any.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is finish,'' he said. ``In five or six months, we get a new
one.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A new shipment or a new cologne?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``A new for-moo-lation,'' he replied.
</P>
<P>
   In plain Inglese, the smell is gone. This does not make me
happy.
</P>
<P>
   After extensive experimentation with fragrance _ everything from
Aramis to Z-14 has passed my wrists since I started wearing cologne
in high school _ I finally had found one to call my own. This one
has a fresh, citrus-y top note that is a blend of bergamot, orange
and other ingredients. It develops on the skin with touches of
woods and mosses. After you wear it a while, amber notes mixed with
fir take over. Best of all, it smells fabulous on me.
</P>
<P>
   There are other scents in my boudoir. Actually, my bathroom
looks like the main floor of Bloomingdale's. I have bottles of
Angel for Men, Chanel Pour Monsieur, Comme des Garcons, Bulgari
Cologne au The Vert, Acqua di Gio, Joop!, and Feeling Man and
Background by Jil Sander.
</P>
<P>
   There's even some Todd Oldham in there, too _ a woman's perfume
that happens to work on me. I wear all of them at times. But
mostly, they're just spray-bottle status symbols adding a bit of
glamour to the top of my toilet tank.
</P>
<P>
   Call me a fragrance victim.
</P>
<P>
   But these were all giveaways _ sample bottles handed out at
store openings, fragrance promotions and fashion shows. Romeo Gigli
per Uomo was the only scent I replaced whenever I started running
low. How could I not? This fragrance had become a part of my style
over the years. To my friends and loved ones, it didn't smell like
Romeo Gigli, it smelled like me.
</P>
<P>
   I couldn't get dressed for a serious date or an important
meeting without it there to boost my self-confidence. Every spritz
smelled sexy and assured even when I felt like a frump. I have
rarely been so attached to a product. But scent is powerful that
way.
</P>
<P>
   Romeo Gigli per Uomo became the aroma of my 30s, the romantic
odor of my not-so-young adulthood. I would get old, but the back of
my ears could always smell the same. Or so I thought.
</P>
<P>
   Now that there is a finite supply of the cologne out there, I've
started haunting Cosmetics Plus and other fragrance purveyors. I
feel like Elaine on that episode of ``Seinfeld,'' searching for her
favorite contraceptive sponges once they've been discontinued.
</P>
<P>
   I've been somewhat lucky, scoring a bottle of my favorite green
elixir here and there. The Gigli store in Manhattan is out, but
Barneys New York, I'm told, does have a stash of my favorite
splash.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very new that we have it back in stock,'' Heidi
Manheimer, a divisional merchandise manager for fragrance at the
store, said the other day. She said she had no idea it was
discontinued.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that's because Romeo Gigli per Uomo came and went
quietly. With a shy air of exclusivity, it hit the market in 1991.
The bottle didn't even bear a label, just a tiny clear sticker on
the underside with the designer's name. It was never a blockbuster
like Egoiste, which was introduced the year before by Chanel, but
it did garner a loyal following during its life span. A second
Gigli men's fragrance, called Sud Est, followed but didn't last
long enough for me even to try it. Apparently, many fragrances
vanish as quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every year, between 60 and 70 fragrances are introduced and
maybe 10 make it in a meaningful way,'' explained Annette Green,
the president of the Fragrance Foundation, a nonprofit educational
arm of the fragrance industry. ``Another 10 may straggle along for
a while and then either disappear or find a tiny niche.'' Gigli,
she said, ``attracted a very solid audience, but the company that
was distributing it went under.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who love a scent stick with it through thick and thin. As
Ms. Manheimer said, ``People get very attached to their
fragrance.'' My allegiance to Romeo Gigli per Uomo has never been
high-minded. It is just that this cologne is to me what Viagra is
to other men.
</P>
<P>
   A little behind each ear and cappuccino baristas are asking for
my home number. With the right fragrance, life can be a Hai Karate
commercial _ strangers do run after you, bewitched by your smell.
</P>
<P>
   You don't get that with Old Spice.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Gigli's Milan publicity office would not tell me
anything about the new fragrance it plans to introduce next year.
When the scent makes its debut, I will, of course, give it a try. I
trust the name. It could turn out to be wonderful. But just in
case, I'm stocking up. I want to smell like myself for as long as I
can. &QL;

 SPICE GIRLS: GIRL POWER _ AND MERCHANDISE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JON PARELES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Scary Spice can sing. Sporty Spice can dance (or at least do
high kicks). Baby Spice and Posh Spice are passable at both tasks.
And competence is all the four Spice Girls need to activate the
most cleverly conceived and slickly marketed pop package since
Madonna showed them the blueprints.
</P>
<P>
   At the PNC Bank Arts Center in Holmdel, N.J., on a tour that
takes them to Madison Square Garden in New York on July 1, the
Spice Girls smiled and strutted their way through a pageant of what
might be called buy-me feminism.
</P>
<P>
   For a sold-out house filled with little girls, like an
elementary-school assembly with parents invited, the Spice Girls
worked the stage like a fashion-show runway. Through nearly a dozen
costume changes, they touted ``girl power'': a mandate to enjoy
female bonding, push men around, wear snazzy clothes and sell
things along the way.
</P>
<P>
   Albums, videos, T-shirts and programs apparently aren't enough
products for the Spice Girls to plug. Before the Girls' two sets
and during an intermission, commercials were shown for cosmetics
and sugar, two things little girls don't need. And as the group
sang ``Move Over,'' a cola logo was projected on the video screen.
In the Spice Girls' pop utopia, a fulfilled woman has loyal
girlfriends, a tractable man and a contract as a spokesmodel.
</P>
<P>
   The songs themselves, performed with a live band and taped
backup vocals, are an assortment of upbeat pop, from Motown to
disco to reggae to hip-hop to big-band swing to hard rock, and full
of benign messages.
</P>
<P>
   They tell would-be boyfriends to be honest, respectful and good
dancers; ballads like ``Two Become One'' and ``Naked'' (which the
Girls performed bare-shouldered and hidden behind strategically
designed chairs) promise that love will bring complete closeness.
</P>
<P>
   Their borrowed material, ``Sisters Are Doin' It for Themselves''
and ``We Are Family,'' proclaimed female solidarity. And in songs
like ``Spice Up Your Life,'' the Spice Girls advertise themselves
as a guarantee of fun.
</P>
<P>
   The Spice Girls themselves are dutiful and a little gawky,
vamping in ways they've learned from rock videos. But the songs,
more than the act, are the Spice Girls' real asset. Stealing widely
and well, the songs stay catchy as they spell out the group's
flirtations and demands. They're exuberant, direct and immediately
likable, and they've turned a group of hard-working but only
moderately gifted performers into stars.
</P>
<P>
   Onstage, each Spice Girl acted out her nickname, more or less.
Emma Bunton (Baby) had her twin ponytails and sequined baby-doll
dresses, and sang ``Where Did Our Love Go?'' (which begins, ``Baby,
baby''); Melanie Chisholm (Sporty) flexed her muscles and wore, at
one point, the jersey for England's World Cup soccer team. Victoria
Adams (Posh), with a new short haircut, held herself with a hint of
reserve; Melanie Brown (Scary) was more vigorous than frightening
in her leopard-patterned clothes. Six male dancers played
deferential suitors, usually ending up at the Girls' feet.
</P>
<P>
   Ginger Spice (Geri Halliwell) has left the group but is not
forgotten. The Spice Girls haven't gotten around to revising their
video and audiotapes, so ``The Lady Is a Vamp'' still names Ginger
as a Spice Girl, and the video for ``Mama'' shows her baby photo.
But editing Ginger out, or replacing her, would take time, and the
Spice Girls, like all pop phenomena, know they have to seize their
moment while it lasts.

 By INGRID ABRAMOVITCH    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A couple of years ago, Eric Stiller, a kayaking
instructor who looks like Popeye in Polartec and who once paddled
halfway around Australia, was preparing to move to Seattle.
Stiller, who approaches kayaking with an almost religious fervor,
was giving up on New York, a city where some people's idea of an
adventure sport is diving through closing subway doors.
</P>
<P>
   But no sooner had he packed his paddles than he got a call from
the newly opened Chelsea Piers sports complex inviting him to start
a kayak program from a dock on the Hudson River.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was almost like `Field of Dreams' _ build it, and they will
come,'' said Stiller, whose decision to stay proved propitious.
Since he founded the Manhattan Kayak Company, the city, once a mere
concrete jungle, has started to look increasingly like an urban
jungle gym. Clad in trail-running shoes and enough Gore-Tex and
microfleece to bivouac on Mount McKinley, New Yorkers have leapt
full force into adventure sports, like much of the rest of the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Stiller paddles up and down the Hudson from dawn to dusk,
gliding by fellow kayakers like John F. Kennedy Jr. and pointing
out the barnacles clinging to Manhattan's aging docks, a sign that
the water quality is improving.
</P>
<P>
   Validation that New York can compete recreationally with any
city on the planet came last year, when Outside magazine ranked it
one of the world's great towns for outdoor enthusiasts. ``Yes, you
read correctly,'' the editors wrote, clearly bracing for a barrage
of hate mail from readers who put up with 100 straight days of rain
for the privilege of paddling across Puget Sound.
</P>
<P>
   But who needs Boulder, Colo., when you can boulder in Central
Park, parasail by the Statue of Liberty or surf the Rockaways? New
York's diverse geographic terrain, with its tidal channels, deep
harbor and rocky outcrops so impressed the California-based
organizers of the 3-year-old Hi-Tec Adventure Racing Series that
they will hold their first urban adventure race here Sunday, in
Pelham Bay Park in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Epstein, executive producer of the series, said he
searched the country for a metropolitan area with terrain rugged
enough to hold the race _ in which 200 teams of three athletes each
run six miles on forest trails, kayak one hour and race mountain
bikes 10 miles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most cities are so developed they don't meet our parameters,''
Epstein said. ``For sure, New York is the best place.''
</P>
<P>
   Stefani Jackenthal, an Upper West Sider who is competing in the
Hi-Tec race, hoped that by training in and around New York she
would gain a home-field edge. Ms. Jackenthal, 31, who sports
diamond studs and black Adidas trail-runners with white mesh
inserts that civilians won't be able to buy until next year (she
tests them for the company), spends a typical weekend biking 50
miles, paddling on the Hudson and carrying a 40-pound pack through
the Ramble in Central Park. While many of her friends have moved to
San Francisco or Denver, Ms. Jackenthal insists it is possible to
live as an adventure athlete in New York. ``There's a pretty deep
community of triathletes, runners and cyclists,'' she said. ``You
can't believe how packed it is in Central Park from 5:30 to 9 in
the morning, with runners, cyclists and in-line skaters all
fighting for space.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, while New Yorkers munch on Powerbars, available at every
corner deli, and shop at stores like Colorado in SoHo, where
mannequins rappel down a two-story climbing wall in the front
window, some might wonder if these urban gearheads venture any
further than the dance floor at Twilo. After all, if you want to
wear Ralph Lauren's Extreme Polo Sport men's cologne, or the Prada
Sport line of mountain clothes, the main muscle you'll need to flex
is financial.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, a series of recent outings around the city turned
up all sorts of locales in which to pursue adventure sports, along
with New Yorkers who were the picture of rude health, carrying on
as though they were in the Alps. In Central Park, Rodney Weber, a
tanned and shirtless fashion model, was traversing the 16-foot-high
boulder known to climbers as Rat Rock.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to bring a brush and a rake with you to sweep away
the rubbish,'' said Weber, who scouts the park for other outcrops
of Manhattan schist to climb, but warns that there can be ``a lot
of needles'' at their base.
</P>
<P>
   There were the Wall Street bond traders who rather than
entertain clients with the usual after-work drinks and dinner, took
them parasailing instead. The group of five hopped a seven-minute
water taxi behind the World Financial Center to Liberty State Park
in Jersey City, where Alex Santoriello of Parasail New York was
waiting. He steered his small ocean boat, the Airgasm, toward lower
Manhattan, while a crewman hooked one of the Wall Streeters to a
large yellow parachute. The Airgasm raced ahead, and the woman was
lifted into the air until her chute was soaring 300 feet over New
York Harbor. Santoriello turned in the direction of the Statue of
Liberty, then steered toward the World Trade Center for a sunset
view.
</P>
<P>
   And off Pier 63 Maritime, at 23d Street and the Hudson River,
there was a scene out of ``Hawaii Five-O'': six paddlers from the
New York Outrigger canoe club chanted in Polynesian as they
propelled an ocean-going outrigger canoe along the city's
coastline. ``It's big surf, big waves,'' said Matt Herbert, a
28-year-old architect, who was one of the paddlers. ``When we get
down to Liberty, we have to really fight through the swell.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, even in the water, it's hard to leave the city
entirely behind. James Arnold, who surfs weekdays at Rockaway Beach
in Queens to escape the stress of running his Manhattan
construction company, said he finds his outdoor sport
``infectious.'' He added archly: ``And that would cover the water.
It can get pretty funky out there.''
</P>
<P>
   For surfers, Rockaway isn't exactly the Banzai Pipeline. The
waves average three to six feet and break close to the shore.
Still, Arnold said, ``you can ride a block or two.'' (His sense of
distance is obviously different from that on Oahu.) The best
surfing is from August through December, when hurricanes far out in
the Atlantic Ocean increase the swell up to 10 feet. What's more,
Arnold said, surfers at Rockaway are welcoming to newcomers, not
always the case at popular beaches in California and Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   Jokes aside, experts say the waterways around New York City are
cleaner than they have been in decades, thanks to strict
environmental laws and new sewage treatment plants. And the
adventure athlete can always get out of town. One reason New York
qualifies as a great outdoor city, according to Outside, is its
proximity to a wide variety of natural landscapes, from hiking
gorges at Bear Mountain to trout streams in the Catskills.
</P>
<P>
   On weeknights, at the 46-foot-high textured fiberglass climbing
wall at Chelsea Piers, many of the regulars are staying in
condition for weekend trips to the Shawangunk Mountains, west of
New Paltz, N.Y., considered one of the top climbing ranges in the
country. ``I think New Yorkers are sick of stinky gyms in the
basement,'' said Les Pawlak, who teaches climbing every other day
at the Chelsea Piers and on alternate days drives the 2 1/2 hours
to the ``Gunks'' (as climbers call the Shawangunks). ``Seven years
ago, there would be 20 cars at the Gunks on a warm Sunday,'' he
said. ``Now, you have 50 cars there on weekdays, and hundreds on
weekends.''
</P>
<P>
   Others with high-pressure New York careers have substituted
noon-time power outings for power lunches. Glenn Lazzaro, who
directs films and commercials, works mornings in NoHo, then drives
to Harriman State Park in Rockland County to ride a wake board, a
type of surfboard, on a lake, or to ride a mountain bike on his
lunch hour. By midafternoon, he is back in his office. ``If I left
right now,'' he said one afternoon at his desk, ``I could be
mountain biking in 45 minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazzaro pretty much has to leave the city to do his trail
riding, because off-road mountain biking is the one sport not
welcome in the concrete jungle. Although mountain bikers have been
spotted on the horse trails at Clove Lakes Park on Staten Island,
among other places, mountain bikes are permitted only on paved
paths in city parks. Ride off-road, and you're likely to be slapped
with a summons and a $50 fine. An exception was made for Sunday's
Hi-Tec race.
</P>
<P>
   (Of course, many city cyclists choose a mountain bike for
ordinary street riding, since the pot-holed pavement and kamikaze
traffic present a fair approximation of wilderness obstacles.)
</P>
<P>
   Many adventure athletes say that what propels them to cling to
the side of a cliff by their fingertips are those moments when they
feel especially mortal. In a city where everyday survival can
sometimes feel like a death-defying act, adventure pursuits might
seem redundant. But the New Yorkers engaged in these sports love
the intense focus and physical exertion. It takes their minds off
of urban routines, they say, giving them a new-found sense of
place.
</P>
<P>
   From the cockpit of a kayak at 8 in the morning, Manhattan looks
especially glamorous. Its spires sparkle in the early-morning
light, and the honking trucks and steaming asphalt are far away.
This is nature, wild and free _ give or take one or two floating
Snapple bottles.

FILMMAKER'S VISION HITS HOME IN BUFFALO, N.Y. 
</HEADLINE>
   (Duplication warning: also sent with `e' code)  
 (bl)  
 By ALEX KUCZYNSKI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In his new movie, ``Buffalo 66,'' Vincent Gallo plays Billy
Brown, a young man newly released from prison who kidnaps a pouty
tap-dance student. Desperate to prove to his parents that he has
made something of his life, he forces her to play the part of his
adoring young wife.
</P>
<P>
   The pair visits Billy's parents at their house in Buffalo, N.Y.,
where the mother, an obsessive football fan, interrupts intimate
conversations with a son she hasn't seen in five years to watch a
tape of a Super Bowl game. She tells Billy's ``wife'' that one of
her great regrets was having missed a Buffalo Bills game because
she was giving birth to Billy.
</P>
<P>
   Billy's father announces when he sees his son at the door,
``Jan, your son is here,'' and turns away.
</P>
<P>
   Gallo, long a fixture of Manhattan's eclectic art community _ he
was a painter, actor and Calvin Klein model before he became a
writer-director _ has acknowledged the autobiographical basis of
``Buffalo 66.'' It is set in his hometown, and he shot scenes in
his own childhood home and used his father's 1960s crooning on the
soundtrack. The portrayal of the two pathologically tough,
unfeeling parents is not for the faint of heart.
</P>
<P>
   So it seemed an odd and even zanily self-destructive gesture to
hold the premiere of ``Buffalo 66'' in Buffalo, and to take part in
a big family picnic on the afternoon preceding it. As one cousin of
Gallo's, a former boxer named Louis ``Kid'' Gallo, said after
seeing the movie: ``If he had made that movie about my parents, I
would have punched his lights out.''
</P>
<P>
   At the picnic last Saturday, in a public park outside Buffalo,
the filmmaker's mother, Janet Gallo, wore a gold necklace and
pinkie ring that spelled out ``Bills'' in looping script. In the
movie, the character of the mother, named Jan, is played with
frantic, self-absorbed intensity by Angelika Huston.
</P>
<P>
   The filmmaker's father, Vincent Gallo Sr., was playing boccie
with Uncle Eugene. Vincent Jr. strolled up to Vincent Sr. and the
father shook his son's hand, then kissed him stiffly on the cheek
in the manner of Italian men, evoking familial love along with a
courteous detachment. And that was all. The two men barely spoke
for the rest of the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my family,'' Gallo said as he surveyed the park, where
the all-American drama of a Little League game unfolded behind the
barbecue pit. In his flared brown pinstripe pants, tight T-shirt
and motorcycle boots, his hair in wild curls, Gallo looked very
much the hip Manhattan dandy come home to show off his new duds and
new life.
</P>
<P>
   As he put a Led Zeppelin compact disk in the portable stereo,
his bright blue eyes took in the dozens of family members lunching
on hamburgers and hot dogs, beans and sausages, chopped salad and
barbecued chicken. ``Can you believe it?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gallo ran away to New York City when he was 16, he said, and has
rarely returned. He began his career as a painter, showing with the
Soho dealer Annina Nosei and playing in rock bands with Jean-Michel
Basquiat. He educated himself. He picked up acting and has appeared
in 15 movies of a decidedly avant-garde slant, including Abel
Ferrara's ``The Funeral'' and Kiefer Sutherland's ``Truth or
Consequences, N.M.'' He appeared as a scruffy, suspicious-looking
monologuist in several commercials shot by Richard Avedon for
Calvin Klein's fragrance CK Be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buffalo 66,'' which opened in New York on Friday, is the first
film he has written and directed. He spent $100,000 of his own
money (``and that's a lot, a lot, for me,'' he said) on the film.
When it was shown at the New Directors/New Films Series in New
York, Janet Maslin praised it in The New York Times as ``a deadpan
original, mixing pathos with bravado.''
</P>
<P>
   ``From the time I was a teen-ager to now, I've only visited
Buffalo a handful of times,'' the filmmaker said a few days after
the premiere. ``Until I met people in New York, people who were
adult and who understood my pathology slightly, until that moment
in my life, I was in deep agony. I couldn't tell anybody that I was
severely depressed or anxious or out of my mind, really. All the
voices of my mother and father I thought I could transcend by
leaving Buffalo I actually continued to inflict on myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Gallo said that when he was 9 years old, he got a job so he
could get out of the house where his frequently unemployed father
was a permanent fixture. ``Dad was this kind of dark, raging
figurehead,'' he remembered. ``That's not who he is today, but when
I was a child there wasn't a day when he taught me anything, spent
time with me, encouraged me _ not a day when he didn't hit me,
punish me, yell at me or tell me something I did wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Writing the script was a big catharsis for me,'' he added. ``I
started writing it in 1989, so all the family scenes were written
years ago, all the family characters. I gave my parents a copy of
the script back then, almost taunting them, daring them to read it.
And they pretended they didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Gallo seems to thrive on conflict in both his personal and
professional lives. He doesn't rely on public-relations advice to
the extent that other actors do, and the resulting frank talk with
reporters gets him into trouble. In the months leading up to the
film's release, he entered into a tabloid battle with Ms. Huston.
``And she'll probably never speak to me again,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Neither, probably, will Sharon Stone, who Gallo said stole an
idea of his, interviewing herself for Harper's Bazaar after Gallo
had interviewed himself for a magazine called Grand Royal. Last
month, Gallo accused Icon magazine of using the one photograph for
their July/August cover that he did not approve, which also landed
him in the gossip columns.
</P>
<P>
   And when ``Buffalo 66'' wasn't accepted into the Cannes Film
Festival, he publicly announced that he had given up his passport,
saying that Cannes had become pointless.
</P>
<P>
   Gallo not only conceived, wrote, directed and starred in
``Buffalo 66,'' he also scored and performed the soundtrack, and
designed the glittering post-disco makeup and the baby-doll dress
worn by Christina Ricci, who plays the blond teeny-bopper he
presses into wifely service.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ridiculous how good-looking she is,'' he said. ``You just
want to pick her up and marry her and love her and kiss her.''
</P>
<P>
   After the family picnic, everyone drove convoy-style to the
premiere of ``Buffalo 66'' at the North Park Theater on Hertel
Avenue in downtown Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Packs of pierced teenagers hovered outside the theater, looking
for movie stars. It was Buffalo's first movie premiere since ``The
Natural'' in 1984. Ms. Ricci and actresses Gaby Hoffman and Asia
Argento showed up. There were also Manhattan friends of Gallo's,
like Jane Pratt, the editor of Jane magazine; Anna Condo, an
art-world figure, and Paige Powell, a former editor of Interview
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Gallo _ stepping from a limousine, wearing leather and looking
like a rock star _ led some of his former classmates from Buffalo's
Sweet Home High School through the throng. During his opening
remarks, he eschewed the squealing microphone and shouted, ``I'd
like to thank my parents for . . .'' and then he paused.
</P>
<P>
   ``Inspiration!'' someone shouted.
</P>
<P>
   Gallo stroked his chin. ``For coming tonight,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The movie rolled, and the audience laughed in recognition at the
familiar Gallo-family mannerisms of Ms. Huston and Ben Gazzara, who
played the role of the father. When Wendy King _ a former Buffalo
Bills cheerleader whose maiden name was lent to the unattainable
former beauty queen played in the movie by Rosanna Arquette _
recognized herself, she shouted out in an admonishing, mothering
tone, ``Vincent!'' and hundreds of people laughed.
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of the film, Billy Brown leads his faux wife to a
hotel, where he plots to murder a Bills place-kicker whom he blames
for a bad bet with a bookie that landed him in prison. Ms. Ricci's
character has by now fallen in love with Billy, and it seems as if
she has persuaded him to fall in love with her, too.
</P>
<P>
   Although Gallo's mother had seen an advance screening of
``Buffalo 66'' in New York in March, Gallo's father was watching it
for the first time. He sat stonily through its often brutal
portrait of family life, laughing only occasionally. The central
plot of the film is interposed with flashbacks from Billy Brown's
childhood. In one, the father strangles his young son's puppy after
the dog wets the rug. Gallo Sr. never strangled his son's puppy _
but the moment obviously had a metaphorical truth for Gallo Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Later, the filmmaker's father incongruously pronounced ``Buffalo
66'' ``an all-around terrific movie.''
</P>
<P>
   Was he disturbed by scenes showing the father as violent and
remote? Gallo said ``No,'' then ``Yes,'' then ``No'' again.
``Vincent did very well in it,'' he concluded. And that's all he
would say.
</P>
<P>
   ``My parents and I have never really done any activities
together. Apart from my mother coming here a few months ago for the
screening, we had no real conversations about my work in any way.
When she saw the film, it was the first time she was ever involved
in my art like that. She was never involved.''
</P>
<P>
   For her part, Mrs. Gallo said, ``I might have overlooked Vincent
a little. It's true that he did all of this on his own. We didn't
support him at all. Which is sad. You know, the first child gets
everything, and the baby is always the baby _ cherished, you
know?'' ( Gallo has an older brother, Charles, and a younger
sister, Janine).
</P>
<P>
   ``So the middle child is the one who gets overlooked, who gets
the hand-me-downs and not enough attention,'' she said. ``I guess I
overlooked Vincent because he had a strong personality. With
Charles, if I gave him a cookie and put him on a blanket he'd sit
there for seven hours. If I did that with Vincent, he'd look at me,
mash the cookie and then go off and jam his fingers into an
electrical outlet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She probably heard that middle-child stuff on TV,'' Gallo
said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite what he considers a tormented childhood, Gallo doesn't
see ``Buffalo 66'' as an excuse to punish his parents. And it seems
he has partially resolved his relationship with them. The day after
the movie's premiere, he spent Father's Day with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a good day,'' he said. ``I'm not looking to get revenge
and external approval to find the serenity and self-approval I
should live with some day. Making this movie gives me, well, it's
not the satisfaction you get when you're a twisted kid and kill a
bug or something. It's not a destructive satisfaction. It doesn't
come with hurting anyone else. It comes from exciting someone else.
It's like cooking a big delicious meal for all of your friends.''
</P>
<P>
   At Recckio's Bowling Lanes in South Buffalo _ another site used
for one of the film's more surreal scenes _ the Gallo family
mingled after the screening with the actresses and editors who
showed up from Manhattan. There was iced coffee, beer, heart-shaped
cookies and Buffalo wings. Everyone had an opinion. Rose Cerasa, a
family friend, said, ``We know that Janet's OK. She's cool. But her
husband, we're not so sure about.''
</P>
<P>
   Chip Mussen, a classmate from Sweet Home High School, jerked his
thumb at the quasi-Shriner's hat Ms. Powell, the former Interview
editor, was wearing and said, ``This is a bit wild for Buffalo.
It's not often we get hats like that up here.''
</P>
<P>
   And Mrs. Gallo, munching on a Buffalo wing, said she didn't
think anyone in the family would be upset about the movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people in Buffalo will have a negative outlook about the
movie,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Because of its wrenching portrayal of the parents?
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, no,'' she said. ``Because we lost that Super Bowl. But we
lost three other ones after that. We lost four in a row! But you
know what? It's tough. You just have to pick yourself up and move
on.''
</P>
<P>
   And she said: ``I don't think Angelika Huston added anything to
this film.'' &QL;

SECOND ACT: THE PERFORMING ARTS LIBRARY 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By MEL GUSSOW   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Behind all the monumental structures at Lincoln
Center is a seemingly small, unobtrusive building. On one side is
the high-vaulted Metropolitan Opera House and on the other is the
Vivian Beaumont Theater with neon lights billboarding its current
theatrical attractions.
</P>
<P>
   The middle building, the New York Public Library for the
Performing Arts, looks like an afterthought.
</P>
<P>
   ``The library has long been invisible on this campus,'' says the
architect James Stewart Polshek. It is, however, one of the most
popular and essential elements of Lincoln Center.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, it surrounds the Beaumont, spreading out into the
large, windowless travertine block that sits atop the theater. When
the $30 million renovation of the library, as redesigned by
Polshek, is completed in 2000, the building will have considerably
expanded its facilities, insuring its role as one of New York's
primary cultural resources.
</P>
<P>
   This will be, said Robert Marx, the executive director of the
Performing Arts Library, ``the most comprehensive rehabilitation of
a Lincoln Center building since Philharmonic Hall was turned into
Avery Fisher Hall.''
</P>
<P>
   The process will be similar. The occupants will move out at the
end of July, and except for a few spaces, the interior of the
library will be rebuilt.
</P>
<P>
   The new structure will be named the Dorothy and Lewis B. Cullman
Center after its primary benefactors. The Cullmans gave $30 million
to the Public Library, $12.5 million earmarked for the Performing
Arts structure. Financial support will also come from the family of
Donald and Mary Oenslager and the City of New York.
</P>
<P>
   Built 33 years ago, the library has long since outgrown its
quarters. Marx credits the original architect, Gordon Bunshaft,
with a visionary plan: ``It was an attempt to make it more than a
library, a place where collections would be illuminated by
performances and exhibitions,'' but the building was designed to
accommodate growth for only 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   In 1965, it was not evident that it would be of such enormous
value to a wide range of people or that the theater collection
would be the most frequently used division.
</P>
<P>
   Marx added, ``At the end of his life, Bunshaft actually
apologized for this building, saying it was an instance where his
personal esthetics were allowed to override the needs of the
client, which happens a lot with architecture.''
</P>
<P>
   Officially the library houses eight million items. Among those
singular items is the entire theatrical clipping file of 20 million
pieces. There are four major research collections: theater, dance,
music and the Rodgers and Hammerstein Archives of Recorded Sound,
the second largest sound archive in the United States, after the
Library of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Within the collections are two other important archival
resources, Theater on Film and Tape (known as TOFT) and the Jerome
Robbins Archive of the Recorded Moving Image, which serves a
similar purpose for dance. In addition, there are special bequests
and purchases, all of which make the library an invaluable
repository of the historical and contemporary.
</P>
<P>
   The library will be redesigned so it can more comfortably handle
the 350,000 visitors that it has every year, plus telephone, fax
and Internet inquiries. There will be new listening and viewing
rooms and perhaps most significant, a central reading room that
will coordinate the services of the collections.
</P>
<P>
   That room will be on the top floor of the library, where there
has been a large exhibition space, and new windows will face
Amsterdam Avenue. The exterior of the building facing the Lincoln
Center plaza will not be altered.
</P>
<P>
   The TOFT archive (of 3,880 items) includes productions in New
York, regional theater and foreign companies like the Piccolo
Teatro of Milan, dialogues with theater artists and such oddities
as a complete set of television commercials by the actor Jack
Gilford. There are also outtakes of Broadway shows shot for use by
television theater critics.
</P>
<P>
   Joel Siegel of ABC contributed 20 minutes of that Broadway
fiasco ``Moose Murders,'' otherwise unrecorded by the library.
Along with other archival items, the videotapes are available only
for private viewing and not for commercial release.
</P>
<P>
   The dance archive, which Robbins financed with royalties from
his production of ``Fiddler on the Roof,'' constitutes more than 50
percent of the dance collection, which also includes tapes given to
the library by visiting companies.
</P>
<P>
   Leading a private tour behind the scenes, Marx revealed a world
that is sharply divided between the users (including scholars and
authors working on projects) and a library staff of 138.
</P>
<P>
   In every room people were listening to music, watching videos or
doing research, often at laptop computers. Meanwhile, backstage,
staff members were gathering items from the stacks and files or
programming them to appear on television screens.
</P>
<P>
   Acting as docent, the director walked to the basement, an
artifact-filled jumble, and pointed out the one door that links the
library to the Beaumont. He then went to a small, windowless room
occupied by Adrian Cosentini, the chief audio engineer.
</P>
<P>
   Among many other things, Cosentini was responsible for the
transfer of the Mapleson wax cylinders to audiotape. These were the
secret recordings made by Lionel Mapleson, the Metropolitan Opera
librarian, of performances at the opera between 1901 and 1904. In
the mid-1980s, those performances were released as a set of
long-playing records. Similarly, there are pirated tapings of
Broadway musicals in the theater collection.
</P>
<P>
   Down a long hallway near the theater collection was an
exhibition of letters from the library's archive: Robert Moses
demanding the removal of Joseph Papp from Central Park (letters
signed Moses, as if the signature were an act of God), letters to
and from Cheryl Crawford and Lillian Gish, production
correspondence of Richard Rodgers and Joshua Logan and, rarest of
all, a letter from Houdini, who seldom wrote letters, perhaps
preferring telepathic communication.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning July 20 all these objects will be moved, with the
circulating collections going to the mid-Manhattan library at Fifth
Avenue and 40th Street and the research collections to the library
annex at 521 West 43rd St., and performance programs shifted to
Cooper Union.
</P>
<P>
   Then, if all goes according to schedule, by the end of 2000,
everything will return to Lincoln Center to the grand new library,
now visible, which Paul LeClerc, president of the New York Public
Library, calls the ``cerebellum of the performing arts industry in
New York _ and the world.'' &QL;

`LOVE'S FOWL': THE INNER LIFE OF CHICKEN LITTLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes at end of review.)  
(lb) 
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ At the vast cultural banquet that is New York, try to
imagine a sorbet course flavored with something exotic, like loco
weed. Anyone who can do that will be on the way to appreciating the
wacky and wise, melodic and mischievous summertime refreshment
being served at the New York Theater Workshop under the title
``Love's Fowl.''
</P>
<P>
   Before retiring the imagination to a padded retreat, try to
visualize this: the tale of Chicken Little, that immemorial prophet
of doom, resurrected in the form of yet another sequel to popular
fiction (imagine ``Gone With the Wind'' and ``Scarlett'').
</P>
<P>
   Now, while planting tongue in cheek and maintaining a firm grip
on reason (try two hands), imagine this story of the foolish fowl,
this ``Recherche du Temps Perdu,'' told by means of puppets made of
wooden clothespins. Well, not so much told as sung, because
``Love's Fowl'' is an opera. And like so many fine operas, it is
sung in Italian, which transforms Chicken Little into La Pulcina
Piccola, which is already music to the ears.
</P>
<P>
   But since the story _ with mass murder, crime passionel, a
sensational trial, tragic love, liaisons dangereuses, show
business, shipwreck on the high seas, adventure on the lone prairie
and an excursion into the spirit world beyond the grave _ is as
lurid as the fever dream of a talk-show host, clearly this is
material for the screen.
</P>
<P>
   But can a single screen hold so rich a helping of the human _
make that chicken _ comedy? Of course not. On the stage, ``Love's
Fowl'' spills over onto three screens. One carries an English
translation of the Italian lyrics. The two others carry the
magnified images of the puppets manipulated by Susan J. Vitucci,
who wrote the canny and clever libretto and sings to the sprightly
music (and occasional voice) of Henry Krieger, the composer of
``Dreamgirls,'' ``Side Show'' and ``The Tap Dance Kid.''
</P>
<P>
   As ``Love's Fowl'' focuses on the post-``sky-is-falling''
adventures of the plucky chicken, it takes La Pulcina Piccola from
her native (and deadly) barnyard into the large world. There,
pummeled by the drumstick of fate, this yellow puffball has a
succession of heartbreaking loves with the likes of Cock Robin and
the Chicken of the Sea, and stars in works like ``Richard III''
while frequently finding herself, as she puts it, ``in a fine stew
for a chicken.''
</P>
<P>
   With its combination of childish figures and supermarket-tabloid
content filtered through talented theatrical sensibilities wise in
the ways of life, ``Love's Fowl,'' running through July 9, is a
cool way to spend a summer evening. It's simultaneously silly and
smart and practically guaranteed to put a smile on the face of all
but the most determined grouch. And it's barely an hour long.
</P>
<P>
   PRODUCTION NOTES:

<P>
   `LOVE'S FOWL'

RJR NABISCO CHIEF DEFENDS TOBACCO INDUSTRY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RAY DELGADO  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The head of RJR Nabisco vigorously defended the
tobacco industry and blamed the defeat of compromise tobacco
legislation on political leaders and public health advocates.
</P>
<P>
   Steven F. Goldstone, chairman and chief executive of the company
that owns R.J. Reynolds tobacco, said Congress fell victim to
advocates who pushed for tobacco tax increases instead of
implementing the agreement that was reached a year ago between the
tobacco companies and the attorneys general of most states.
</P>
<P>
   That compromise fell by the wayside as the Senate took up
another proposal that would have added a $1.10 tax on each pack of
cigarettes and using a portion of that money to combat smoking
among teen-agers. The Senate's Republican leadership killed that
bill last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is wrong to say last week's event was a victory for tobacco
companies,'' Goldstone said at a luncheon in San Francisco
Thursday. ``We tried last year ... to chart a new course and that
effort has completely failed. Last week only proved that.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldstone also said he held no ill will against San Francisco,
the first city in the country to file a lawsuit against the tobacco
industry in an attempt to recover tax money spent on
smoking-related illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love San Francisco,'' Goldstone told a gathering of tobacco
opponents and members of the Commonwealth Club of California, which
sponsored the luncheon. ``We'll just have to let the lawsuit play
out. That doesn't affect my view of the city.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked what he thought about numerous anti-smoking efforts
in California, Goldstone said his company disagreed with the
policies in principal, but had no problems with states determining
their own regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Several of his opponents in the audience disagreed with that
statement, saying the industry was funding smokers rights groups
that have challenged the laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``Either he doesn't know what his underlings are doing or he's
not being forthcoming about how much influence (the industry) has
at state and local levels,'' said Lisa Goldman, spokeswoman for the
Berkeley-based Americans for Nonsmokers' Rights.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco City Attorney Louise Renne said she was impressed
with Goldstone's presentation but didn't buy the argument.
</P>
<P>
   ``His speech certainly ignored a lot of the history of the
tobacco industry,'' said Renne, who is overseeing her office's case
against R.J. Reynolds and five other tobacco companies. ``Obviously
he is still hoping that the June 1997 settlement will be passed.''
</P>
<P>
   Renne said her office was fighting efforts by the tobacco
industry to consolidate several California lawsuits for one trial
to be held in San Diego. The lawsuit is scheduled to go to trial
next March at the U.S. District Court in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Stanton Glantz, a University of Calfornia at San Francisco
professor of cardiology and leading anti-tobacco advocate,
criticized Goldstone's portrayal of the tobacco industry as a
law-abiding corporation under unfair attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``They deserve to be demonized,'' Glantz said of the $60 billion
industry. ``They should get out of the tobacco industry. Lots of
things are constitutional but not responsible or ethical.''

FOR MANY, MARX'S `MANIFESTO' REMAINS RELEVANT
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By PAUL LEWIS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Karl Marx may have been right after all.
</P>
<P>
   As readers revisit ``The Communist Manifesto'' on its 150th
anniversary, those on the left and the right have been struck by
the eerie way in which its 1848 description of capitalism resembles
the restless, anxious and competitive world of today's global
economy.
</P>
<P>
   Economists and political scientists note how the manifesto,
written by Marx and Friedrich Engels, recognized the unstoppable
wealth-creating power of capitalism, predicted it would conquer the
world, and warned that this inevitable globalization of national
economies and cultures would have divisive and painful
consequences.
</P>
<P>
   ``The manifesto speaks to our time,'' says Dani Rodrik,
professor of international political economy at Harvard University.
``Marx saw capitalism as the driving force of history. But he also
warns of the divisions that capitalism's spread would bring, of the
social orders destroyed.''
</P>
<P>
   The British Marxist historian Eric Hobsbawm describes the
manifesto's portrait of capitalism as ``recognizably the world we
live in 150 years later'' in his introduction to the elegant little
edition brought out by the British-based publisher Verso to mark
the anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   Marx and Engels probably would not wish to be remembered today
for having predicted capitalism's success. The manifesto is a
quintessentially revolutionary document that calls for the
abolition of private property, the replacement of marriage by a
``community of women,'' concentration of political power in the
hands of the proletariat and the replacement of the state by ``an
association in which the free development of each is the condition
for the free development of all.''
</P>
<P>
   None of that occurred. The capital-owning bourgeoisie did not
become their own gravediggers by driving an increasingly pauperized
proletariat to revolution. And far from ``withering away'' as class
conflict subsides, the Soviet state became a monstrous instrument
of oppression and then collapsed of its own weight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marx underestimated capitalism's ability to buy proletarian
support by gradually enfranchising them,'' Rodrik said, adding, ``A
series of implicit social contracts underpins capitalism, of which
the most recent was probably the creation of welfare states and
social security systems after the Second World War.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Communist Manifesto: New Interpretations'' (Edinburgh
University Press), one of several studies published this year, the
late Wal Suchting of Sydney University reverses the pamphlet's
famous opening sentence to conclude that ``the specter of communism
has ceased to haunt Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   What remains, however, is the manifesto's vivid, even visionary
presentation of capitalism as an untamable force that could sweep
away the Middle Ages and anything else in its way.
</P>
<P>
   ``All old-established national industries have been destroyed or
are daily being destroyed. They are dislodged by new industries
whose introduction becomes a life or death question for all
civilized nations ... industries whose products are consumed not
only at home but in every quarter of the globe.''
</P>
<P>
   Or: ``Constant revolutionizing of production, uninterrupted
disturbance of social conditions, everlasting uncertainty and
agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones.''
</P>
<P>
   The manifesto's warnings about capitalism's periodic crises
foreshadowed the Great Depression of the 1930s and the more recent
cataclysms in Mexico and Asia.
</P>
<P>
   And despite the dire language, readers may be reminded of the
recent layoff of 15,000 workers at Motorola to meet mounting
competition, the 18 million unemployed in Europe, the growing
disparity in income throughout the world and workers' increasing
insecurity as companies shift production to countries with lower
wages.
</P>
<P>
   The manifesto also foresaw that the spread of capitalism would
bring a steady alignment of national cultures: ``The intellectual
creations of individual nations become common property. National
one-sidedness and narrow-mindedness become more and more impossible
and from the numerous national and local literatures, there arises
world literature.''
</P>
<P>
   Here is a foretaste of the dominance of English and of the
Americanization of life elsewhere as Mickey Mouse, Coca-Cola and
McDonald's become universal symbols.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Cultures of Globalization,'' to be published in August
by Duke University Press, Frederick Jameson offers two contrasting
visions of the world literature that Marx and Engels predicted.
What Jameson hopes cultural globalization creates is ``an immense
global urban intercultural festival without a center or even any
longer a dominant cultural mode.'' What he fears is that it might
come to mean ``increasing standardization on an unparalleled
scale'' as human history becomes ``a tortuous progression toward
the American consumer as a climax.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Concerns about the darker side of capitalism's success is
prompting writers to offer their own updated prescriptions. For the
far left, the social strains and tensions that the emergence of a
global economy is now creating are an added reason for
nationalizing private property.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Communist Manifesto Now: Socialist Register 1998''
(Monthly Review Press, New York) Leo Panitch of York University in
Toronto and Colin Leys, an emeritus professor of politics at Queens
University in Kingston, Ontario, argue that ``the irreconcilability
of democracy with private property'' must ``come clearly back on
the agenda.'' They insist, however, that this does not mean
abolishing ``personal possessions.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Socialist parties and Communist parties may have run their
course, but the strains of globalization will throw up new
institutions demanding change,'' Panitch says.
</P>
<P>
   Other political scientists and sociologists have called for a
new social contract to restrain the disruption global capitalism is
causing in ordinary people's lives. ``We're neglecting this. We
need a new social insurance to soften world capitalism,'' argues
Rodrik, who set out his ideas last year in a book called ``Has
Globalization Gone Too Far?''
</P>
<P>
   William Greider, author of ``One World, Ready or Not'' (Simon &AMP;
Schuster, 1997) suggests steps to ``moderate the pace of industrial
revolution'' and reduce the ``danger of a tragic breakdown,''
including controls on capital movements around the world, debt
forgiveness for poorer nations, higher taxes on wealth and lower
ones on labor.
</P>
<P>
   In ``False Dawn: The Delusions of Global Capitalism'' (Granta
Books, 1998) John Grey, a politics professor at Oxford University
and a disillusioned conservative, denounces moderate leftist and
right-wing parties for supporting free trade and a single global
market, ``a utopia that can never be realized but which already
produced social dislocation and economic and political instability
on a large scale.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not everyone is a doomsayer. Saskia Sassen of
Columbia University argues that globalization does not necessarily
mean an unregulated economic free-for-all. In ``Globalization and
Its Discontent'' (The New Press, 1998), she points out that big
multinational corporations typically prefer doing business in
countries where the rule of law is strong.
</P>
<P>
   She adds, however, that new regulatory frameworks ``need to be
discovered and invented, as does the meaning of accountability and
democratization in the new global information economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone agrees that the manifesto was really that
visionary. In the current issue of ``Foreign Policy,'' Helen Milner
of Columbia University says that although globalization is said to
weaken governments, foster unemployment and promote profitability
as the universal yardstick of achievement, government spending
remains fairly constant and nations are preserving very different
kinds of welfare states. This suggests ``globalization is neither
producing convergence nor undermining labor and may not be
irreversible.''
</P>
<P>
   Take that, Karl.

IN ACCOUNTING MERGER, STOCK MUST GO, SO WORKERS FACE TAX BILLS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 28) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ANNE TERGESEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With stocks both volatile and expensive, it's not easy to find
good investments these days. Imagine how much more difficult it
would be if a quarter of all public companies and more than half
the mutual funds were off limits.
</P>
<P>
   That is the situation confronting many of the 140,000 employees
of Price Waterhouse and Coopers &AMP; Lybrand, the accounting giants
that will officially become _ deep breath, please _
PricewaterhouseCoopers on July 1.
</P>
<P>
   Ethics rules forbid accountants from owning stock in a client.
So many Price Waterhouse employees must scramble to unload
investments in the clients of Coopers, and vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   Among the forbidden holdings are many blue-chip stocks and
mutual funds considered investment staples, like IBM, AT&AMP;T,
Hewlett-Packard, Exxon, Ford Motor, Chase Manhattan, Johnson &AMP;
Johnson and the Fidelity and Vanguard fund families.
</P>
<P>
   Employees have until the end of July to comply, with no leeway,
said Gerald M. Ward, a partner at Price Waterhouse. With the stock
market near record highs, those who must sell may face big tax hits
unless they have losses to offset the capital gains.
</P>
<P>
   Accountants can face this problem every time they accept new
clients, but not on this burdensome a scale, Ward said. This time,
some of the bean counters are not going quietly.
</P>
<P>
   There is no official plan to help affected employees shield
gains when they sell, though there was talk of setting up a sort of
joint blind trust that would have allowed Price Waterhouse
employees to pool their forbidden shares in a professionally
managed partnership and defer some taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The plan was rejected in part because it would have meant
sharing one another's investing mistakes, too, said Lawrence
Portnoy, a Price Waterhouse partner.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, neither firm says it has done much besides reminding
employees to purge their portfolios of the 3,217 public companies
that the two firms audit.
</P>
<P>
   Informally, individuals sitting on steep capital gains have
weighed various options. One is to give appreciated stock to
dependent children over age 13. Under the rules, the children
themselves must sell by the deadline, but their capital gains tax
rate on the first $20,000 is likely to be 10 percent, half that of
the parents, said Bernard Kent, a tax partner at Coopers &AMP; Lybrand.
</P>
<P>
   Another alternative is to give shares to charity. Donor-advised
funds offered by community foundations and mutual fund companies
like Fidelity accept and manage cash and securities, distributing
gifts to charities at the donors' recommendation. Besides skipping
capital gains taxes, the donor gets a tax deduction and the fund
earns tax-free interest for further gifts, Kent said.
</P>
<P>
   A variation on the theme, more suited to younger employees with
sizable gains, is a charitable remainder trust. The stock must
still be sold, but the trust, which is tax-exempt, can do the
selling, and the donor can retain some of the profits through an
annuity, Kent said.
</P>
<P>
   One retired Price Waterhouse partner, who spoke on the condition
of anonymity, used methods like these to sidestep nearly all of a
potential $42,000 tax bill and secure a tax deduction. The partner
sold $80,000 worth of losers and marginal performers for a net gain
of $7,000, but he gave his winners _ $250,000 worth of stock in
Coopers &AMP; Lybrand clients _ to children, grandchildren, and
charities, making the charitable contributions directly and through
foundations and a donor-advised fund.
</P>
<P>
   Others say they plan to simply sell their stock, pay the tax
bill and reinvest what remains in a shrinking list of acceptable
replacements. Kent, for one, is unloading his family's Vanguard
funds, which comprise about a third of their portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife has been with Vanguard longer than she has been with
me,'' he said. ``It was extremely traumatic for her to sell.''
</P>
<P>
   The firms, too, must purge 401(k) and other retirement plans of
funds run by each other's clients, with Coopers replacing all six
funds in one plan, Kent said.
</P>
<P>
   The stock-ownership rules are part of a broad ethics code
intended to prevent conflicts of interest for auditors, who might
otherwise be tempted to sign off on cooked books to improve stock
prices.
</P>
<P>
   Retired and current partners who share in an auditing firm's
profits are barred from investing in every client, while salaried
managers need only avoid stock in clients audited by the office
where they work, said Kenneth E. Dakdduk, a partner at Coopers &AMP;
Lybrand.
</P>
<P>
   Spouses, children and support staff are also covered under
certain conditions; violations can result in lost licenses.
</P>
<P>
   The profession's self-regulatory organization is working to
overhaul the ethics rules. While the stock ownership restriction is
not currently on the table, Ward said, the standards may change
because of a general feeling that, as accounting firms grow larger
and develop large consulting practices, rules that made sense for a
simple auditing practice are becoming obsolete.

HOW A CLOSED-END FUND AIMS TO TAME ITS DISCOUNT  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 28) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Fla., Mass.)   (af)  
 By CAROLE GOULD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Shareholders have complained for ages that closed-end funds
often trade at steep discounts to their net asset values. For just
as long, fund managements have, by and large, shrugged their
shoulders over the matter. But now one fund seems determined to
prove that it takes the issue seriously.
</P>
<P>
   The France Growth fund, with $275 million in assets, has adopted
a plan intended to reduce the fund's discount to net asset value,
in part by cutting the fund adviser's fee by a percentage equal to
that of the discount.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, announced on June 16, the fund adviser's current
fee would be cut some 18 percent to reflect the fund's current 18
percent discount.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike open-end mutual funds, which issue and redeem shares at
net asset value, closed-end funds issue a fixed number of shares
that trade like those of ordinary companies. As such, they may
trade at a premium or discount to their net asset value.
</P>
<P>
   Activist shareholders have increasingly sought to force
closed-end funds to convert to open-end status as a way of
eliminating the discount. Some shareholders have filed lawsuits or
engaged in proxy fights that can become nasty.
</P>
<P>
   France Growth is not involved in any such battle, but it could
feel pressure down the road.
</P>
<P>
   According to Frederick J. Schmidt, vice president and treasurer
of the fund, the fee-cutting move is meant to align the fund
management's interests with those of its shareholders. ``This is
something that is to our mind unique to the industry,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Others agree. ``This is historic _ it's never been done,'' said
David Schachter, a vice president at Thomas J. Herzfeld Advisors, a
closed-end fund research and advisory firm based in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   The fund's adviser, Indocam International Investment Services, a
unit of Credit Agricole, the big French bank, currently receives a
management fee equal to 0.9 percent for the first $100 million of
assets under management, according to Schmidt, and 0.8 percent on
assets above that amount.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new policy, Schmidt said, Indocam will not be entitled
to a higher fee if the fund's shares begin to trade at a premium to
their net asset value.
</P>
<P>
   In another move to reduce fees, the fund has adopted a policy,
subject to Securities and Exchange Commission approval, to pay
quarterly distributions that amount to at least 3 percent of the
fund's assets, or 12 percent annually. By cutting into assets, this
will have the effect of reducing management fees if the fund fails
to grow at an equal or greater rate.
</P>
<P>
   The plan will try to make sure that distributions are in the
form of long-term capital gains, which are taxed at the minimum
capital gains tax rate of 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The big question is whether the two moves will have the desired
effect of reducing the fund's discount. And the answer will be
watched closely by managers of other closed-end funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one can really say for sure _ you'll have to wait and and
see,'' Schachter said. ``But it raises the bar of responsibility of
what a fund can do.''
</P>
<P>
   France Growth has recently had a stellar performance, returning
57.1 percent for the 12 months ended June 24.
</P>
<P>
   The Subadviser Factor
</P>
<P>
   Let's say a fund megacomplex has done a great job managing your
portfolio of domestic stocks. But now it's time to shift some
assets abroad, and you're wondering whether to use the same firm to
manage your international fund.
</P>
<P>
   It may pay to consider whether the international offering is
run, or subadvised, by an outside manager. According to a recent
study by the Financial Research Corp., a fund research and
consulting company in Boston, that can have a significant effect on
returns.
</P>
<P>
   The study reviewed 566 international and global stock fund
portfolios, of which 156, or 27.6 percent, used subadvisers. The
returns for the funds run by subadvisers lagged behind those
managed in-house by an average of 2.3 percentage points,
annualized, for the three years through February 1998. Performance
lagged for other periods, too, but not as much.
</P>
<P>
   A small part of the poorer performance may be accounted for by
the extra layer of fees that subadvisory arrangements sometimes
foist on shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   For international or global stock funds managed in-house, the
average management fee is 0.76 percent, compared with 0.90 percent
for funds with subadvisers.
</P>
<P>
   More important, outside managers may assume more market risk to
generate bigger returns that compensate for the higher fees, said
Raymond D. Libertore, a Financial Research analyst who studied the
data.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe fund families like Franklin Resources' Templeton and
Scudder that keep their international and global funds in-house are
likely to have the expertise to generate superior performance.
</P>
<P>
   The study also looked at domestic funds, but found the
performance gap to be far smaller. Over three years, annualized
returns for domestic funds with subadvisers were less than 1
percent behind those of comparable funds handled in-house.

NORWAY'S TALL STRIKER LOOMS OVER WORLD CUP'S FAVORED TEAMS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ja)

<P>
   AIX-EN-PROVENCE, France _ The five Flo brothers grew up along
Norway's northern fjords, playing soccer inside the house with
Ping-Pong balls. The brothers divided into teams, but the only real
loser was the furniture, according to midfielder Jostein Flo.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we became professionals, we bought all new furniture,''
Flo said with a laugh at Friday's final training session before
Norway's second-round World Cup match against Italy on Saturday in
Marseilles.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the Flo brothers went on to play high-level football in
Norway. Two of them, Jostein and Tore Andre, are playing in the
World Cup. Their cousin, Havard Flo, is also on the team. The star
is unquestionably Tore Andre, who scored a goal and drew a penalty
that his teammate Kjetil Rekdal converted into the winning goal in
Wednesday's stunning 2-1 victory over Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   While Jostein Flo joked that he crushed the Ping-Pong balls on
his feet, thus relegating himself to a supporting role in midfield,
his brother could juggle them effortlessly.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has that extra to score goals,'' Jostein said of Tore Andre
Flo.
</P>
<P>
   Tore Andre Flo, 25, does not always play regularly for his club
team, Chelsea, in the English Premier League, which is blessed with
a full supply of goal scorers. But he is indispensable to Norway's
national team, having produced 13 goals in 28 matches. He scored
twice in a 4-2 victory over Brazil last year and once on Wednesday
in the Norwegians' third 1998 World Cup game. Is there another
country that has played Brazil three times and never lost?
</P>
<P>
   Norway's tall players are renowned for their play in the air,
but at 6 feet 5 inches, Tore Andre Flo seems equally comfortable on
the ground. He drove Junior Baiano to distraction Wednesday,
whirling like a rodeo bull and leaving the Brazilian defender's
only defense in the final minutes to grab Flo's shirt and pull him
backward.
</P>
<P>
   Esse Bahamarst, the American referee who awarded Norway a
penalty kick, was roundly criticized for what appeared to be a
phantom foul, but newly released television footage showed Baiano
clearly yanking on Flo's jersey as if it were taffy.
</P>
<P>
   There are more famous strikers in this World Cup _ Ronaldo of
Brazil, Roberto Baggio of Italy, Gabriel Batistuta of Argentina,
Juergen Klinsmann of Germany _ but none is more vital to the
success of his team than Tore Andre Flo.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my opinion, he is among the best in the world,'' Norway
Coach Egil Olsen said. ``I wouldn't trade him for anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, Italy defeated Norway, 1-0, in the World Cup,
despite having its goalie, Gianluca Pagliacu, ejected in the 21st
minute for touching the ball with his hands outside the penalty
area.
</P>
<P>
   Dino Baggio later provided the game's only goal. He scored off a
free kick with a header, an unforgivable offense in Norway (players
are supposed to be dominant in the air).
</P>
<P>
   Scoring figures to be miserly again in the rematch. Perhaps the
first goal will be the only goal, Tore Andre Flo said. That is the
way Norway tends to play, using the long ball, clogging the middle
and using Tore Andre Flo as a lone striker. Mario Zagallo, the
Brazilian coach, dismissed this approach as ``anti-football.''
Perhaps, but there may not be a team more feared by the traditional
soccer powers than Norway.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is difficult to score against us,'' Rekdal said. ``It's not
the nicest football, but we can't play like Brazil. We play our
way. We bring the ball to the opposing penalty box and try to
attack as fast as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Tore Andre Flo is always there, standing like a lightning rod,
ready to create electricity. To his mother's everlasting
appreciation, he has taken his game outdoors and the furniture
survives as furniture, not fireplace kindling.
</P>
<P>
   ``She got mad sometimes,'' he said. ``But after two or three
minutes, she was glad again.''  &QL;

NINE BODIES FOUND ON NORTH KOREAN SUBMARINE 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ South Korean army officers said Friday that they had
found evidence that the North Korean submarine caught this week in
a fishing net had been engaged in an infiltration mission and had
just picked up or dropped off spies or commandos.
</P>
<P>
   A search of the submarine found the bodies of nine North
Koreans, four of whom were grouped together and had died of single
gunshot wounds to the head.
</P>
<P>
   The five others were scattered around the submarine and had
bullet wounds in various parts of their bodies, the South Korean
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were some signs of disagreement among them about whether
to commit a group suicide,'' said Maj. Gen. Chung Young-jin. ``It
appears as if five were shot first by the remaining four, who then
killed themselves afterward.''
</P>
<P>
   The submarine was discovered after its periscope became tangled
in a drift net 11 miles off the South Korean coast. North Korea has
said it was on a routine training run and somehow became wrecked
and drifted off course, but the South rejected that explanation
Friday as a ``baseless fabrication.''
</P>
<P>
   Many military analysts say North Korea routinely uses submarines
to drop off spies in South Korea for intelligence gathering, but
any public evidence of that would heighten the tensions between the
two Koreas. It would also make it more difficult for South Korean
President Kim Dae-jung to pursue his policy of conciliation to the
North.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea did not respond to the espionage allegations.
However, it has consistently denied sending infiltrators into South
Korea.
</P>
<P>
   So far, South Korean officials are emphasizing that economic
cooperation with the North will not be affected by the incursion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to cope sternly with the national security issue, but
economic issues don't need to be disturbed,'' said Kang In-duk, the
national unification minister.
</P>
<P>
   South Korean officials said they found two South Korean soft
drink containers in the submarine, an indication that there might
have been a pickup of spies along the coast. Some of the North
Koreans also had sand on their clothes, as if they had been on a
beach recently, South Korean television reported.
</P>
<P>
   On board the submarine, searchers found two AK-47 assault
rifles, two heavier machine guns, a rocket launcher, two handguns
and two grenades. There was also some American-made diving
equipment such as wet suits and flippers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Considering their clothes and weapons and other materials, it
is certain that the submarine was engaged in an infiltration
mission by the North's special agents,'' the Defense Ministry said
in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The South Korean news media are speculating that the five North
Koreans who appear to have been executed may have been the
submarine's crew, while the four who committed suicide may have
been commandos who had just been picked up.
</P>
<P>
   South Korea has examined the submarine with enormous care for
fear that it might be booby-trapped. Instead of entering by the
hatch, navy investigators first drilled small holes in the side and
inserted cameras to check for bombs.
</P>
<P>
   Among those investigating the submarine is Lee Kwang-su, the
only known survivor of a North Korean submarine incursion in 1996.
In that case, the submarine ran aground on the South Korean coast,
and 26 people on board slipped ashore.
</P>
<P>
   Of those 26, most were killed by South Korean armed forces or
executed by fellow North Koreans who apparently feared that they
would disclose information if caught. One was never found and is
presumed to have either made his way back to the North or to have
died in the woods. &QL;

TAPES OF THREE PRESIDENTS TO BE FOCUS OF NEW STUDY 
</HEADLINE>
   (Ideas)  
(lb) 
 By JUDITH MILLER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   One historian calls them the ``Dead Sea Scrolls of American
political history.'' Another compares them to the ``discovery of
Pompeii.''
</P>
<P>
   They are the tapes. Thousands of hours of presidential
deliberations spanning the Kennedy, Johnson and Nixon
administrations.
</P>
<P>
   ``These audiotapes will do for the study of government what the
discovery of Pompeii did for the study of Rome,'' said Philip
Zelikow, who recently left Harvard University to head the
University of Virginia's Miller Center of Public Affairs. ``The
books and studies that emerge from this project will help replace
the Hollywood image of White House decision-making with a
real-world understanding of how government actually works.''
</P>
<P>
   Beginning this fall, at least six scholars will begin
systematically transcribing and studying the presidential
audiotapes recorded between 1962 and 1973 at the Miller Center.
Studies commissioned by what is being called the ``Presidential
Recordings Project'' are to be published by Harvard University
Press.
</P>
<P>
   Zelikow has a first-hand appreciation of both the inner workings
of government and the tapes of decision-making at the highest
level. A former career diplomat who worked on the National Security
Council in the Bush administration, he is also the co-author of a
recent book on the Cuban missile crisis, ``The Kennedy Tapes,''
published in 1997 by Harvard University Press.
</P>
<P>
   That book was based on just 8 percent _ 21 of some 260 hours _
of President John F. Kennedy's taped meetings and dictabelt
recordings of telephone conversations.
</P>
<P>
   Equally important, he and other presidential scholars say, is
the tapes' potential role in reshaping scholarship and renewing
interest in what many historians call the undervalued field of
contemporary political history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Traditional, presidential-centered history has definitely been
in the doldrums,'' said Ernest May, co-author of the ``Kennedy
Tapes,'' a presidential scholar and a visiting fellow at Queens
College, Oxford, who will serve on the Miller Center's advisory
board.
</P>
<P>
   At many universities, critics complain, specialists in gender
studies or social and cultural history who have embraced the need
to study what historians call ``history from the bottom up'' are
crowding out experts on the presidency, government institutions and
power relationships.
</P>
<P>
   The critics note that the positions of a number of prominent
historians who have left their posts have not been replaced, among
them Robert Dallek, formerly of the University of California at Los
Angeles, Bradford Perkins, formerly of the University of Michigan,
and Robert Divine, formerly of the University of Texas at Austin.
</P>
<P>
   ``This should be the golden age of archival research,'' said
Timothy Naftali, who is leaving Yale to join the Miller Center.
``But most American history departments have no interest in hiring
young professors of political history and international affairs.
The Vietnam generation, which now controls hiring, is uncomfortable
with power and those who study it.''
</P>
<P>
   Naftali's new, highly praised book, ``One Hell of a Gamble,'' an
international history of the Cuban missile crisis, is based partly
on the Kennedy tapes.
</P>
<P>
   Calling the tapes the ``Dead Sea Scrolls of American political
history,'' he is eager to start work on another book on Cold War
intelligence and help Zelikow begin training a ``cadre of scholars
who will help bring this incredible material to life.'' For younger
scholars fascinated by presidential power, he said, ``Philip's
center is an intellectual safe haven.''.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Zelikow notes that while some of the tapes have long been
public, they have not really been accessible. National archivists
virtually gave up the laborious task of transcribing them until
1993, when digital audiotape machines that were easy to mark and
scroll through were developed.
</P>
<P>
   This technological breakthrough has in turn speeded
declassification of the material. About 40 percent of the Kennedy
tapes and dictabelts are now publicly available, Zelikow says. Most
of the Johnson tapes through 1965 are also accessible, and while
the Nixon family is still challenging access to raw tapes and what
constitutes fair compensation for them, some 4,000 hours of tapes
can already be listened to.
</P>
<P>
   The material has led to several important books, including, for
example, the first of Michael Beschloss' three-volume work on
Lyndon Johnson's presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the tapes, answers to some of modern American
history's most contentious issues may be resolved, Naftali said,
such issues as whether Kennedy intended to withdraw from Vietnam
before his assassination.
</P>
<P>
   The tapes, Zelikow said, ``are about as close as we can come to
the historian's dream of traveling in time and directly witnessing
what actually happened, which is nearly always stranger, more
complicated and more disorderly than we assume. The tapes compel
you to re-enter their world.''

EPA YANKS SAN FRANCISCO AREA'S CLEAN-AIR STATUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JANE KAY  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The Environmental Protection Agency has punished
the San Francisco Bay area by taking away its coveted clear-air
status, leaving nine counties vulnerable to tougher pollution
controls on cars, factories and households.
</P>
<P>
   An increase in unhealthful levels of smog in 1995 and 1996
represented a trend toward worsening air quality, and triggered the
official ruling that the region no longer complied with the federal
Clean Air Act.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're correcting the label to account for reality. The Bay
area has been out of attainment of the law for the past three
years,'' EPA Regional Administrator Felicia Marcus said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a truth-in-advertising issue so the public can hold us
all accountable for the actions that the district and we need to
take for the public's health protection,'' Marcus said.
</P>
<P>
   The Bay Area Air Quality Management District, which has fought
the redesignation along with the state and Metropolitan
Transportation Commission, expressed displeasure with the
announcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're disappointed that this has happened. We don't feel the
EPA action today will further protect public health,'' said Ellen
Garvey, executive officer of the district.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the coming months, we will continue to work with EPA, the
public and industrial stake holders on a realistic and responsible
ozone attainment strategy,'' Garvey said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the Bay area was the eighth smoggiest metropolitan area
in the nation. In 1996, it was the sixth worst. The new
designation, which is part of a periodic review, won't immediately
affect industrial permits or place curbs on cars.
</P>
<P>
   Cars and trucks, consumer products, industry and homes that use
petroleum products and fossil fuels are main sources of
ground-level ozone, the primary ingredient in smog.
</P>
<P>
   Under the EPA guidelines, regional agencies will have to work to
reduce traffic, promote mass transit and improve smog-inspection
programs, and tighten permits on oil refineries, dry cleaners and
factories.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the EPA's designation will cost the region $8
million in federal money next year earmarked to control traffic
congestion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is, they have to do more. It's not for the
feds to come in and tell them what to do. It's their job to meet
the law. There are plenty of communities that have stricter plans.
All they have to do is go shopping in the L.A. (clean air)
measures,'' Marcus said.
</P>
<P>
   Bay-area Environmentalists applauded the EPA's action, which was
announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Sierra Club and Communities for a Better
Environment petitioned the EPA to take away the Bay area's
clean-air designation that it had conferred with much fanfare in
1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody has to take responsibility to reduce air
pollution,'' said Julia May, an analyst for Communities for a
Better Environment. ``Individual people want to have non-polluting
consumer choices and are doing their part. But in the short term,
the first thing you do is crack down on the big sources.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd like the Bay area to get tough on the biggest sources.
The oil refineries belch out air pollution, and they get special
exemptions while the air district requires the little people to
meet standards,'' May said.

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 28)  
 (af)  
 By MICHELLE KREBS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ten years ago, who could have predicted that a small, open-top
car reminiscent of British-made MGs and Triumphs of the 1950s and
'60s would be so wildly successful that it would spawn a wave of
imitators, reviving the virtually dead market for sports roadsters?
It was, after all, an era of largely sensible, aerodynamic,
look-alike sedans.
</P>
<P>
   But the Mazda Miata, introduced in 1989 as a 1990 model, turned
out to be a breath of fresh air. Mazda has now sold more than
450,000 Miatas worldwide, more than half in North America to young
people buying their one and only car and to nostalgic baby boomers
who have made it the second or third car in their household fleets.
</P>
<P>
   Now, nearly a decade later, Mazda has come out with its first
redesign of the Miata, and a weeklong test drive proved that this
sequel improves on the extraordinary original. Everything that was
good about the first Miata has been made even better in the 1999
MX-5.
</P>
<P>
   Casual observers will notice little difference between the old
Miata and the new one. The black test model parked in my driveway
for a week drew little more than a matter of fact, ``Oh, the
Miata.'' There is no question in anyone's mind of what the car is,
which is precisely Mazda's point.
</P>
<P>
   In unveiling the car at the auto show in Detroit in January, Tom
Matano, designer of the original Miata who now heads Mazda's
California design studio, succinctly stated the company's design
philosophy for the roadster: ``We want people seeing the Miata from
a distance to ask, `Is that a Miata?' '' he said. ``As they get
closer, we want them to say, `Yep, that's a Miata, but that's a new
Miata.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Evolutionary redesigns do not always come out well, but the new
Miata's styling accomplishes its goals without unnecessary
additions.
</P>
<P>
   It will not be confused with the many other roadsters on the
highways. With dimensions virtually identical to the model it
replaces, the Miata continues its classic, timeless and simple
design. Yet, it appears fresh.
</P>
<P>
   The most significant exterior differences appear on the front
end. Front fenders are more sculpted and the built-in head lamps
replace the pop-up variety of the original. The tail lamps are
updated but the back maintains the simple, uncluttered appearance
of the original.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, the interior remains familiar but freshened. The
air-bag housing in the center of the beefy three-spoked steering
wheel is more compact for a better view of the instrument panel.
The instrument panel layout is the same as the original design, but
the chrome trim around the gauges has been discarded for a cleaner,
more contemporary look.
</P>
<P>
   (Interestingly, as Mazda eliminates the chrome trim, other
manufacturers, including Chrysler and Mercedes-Benz, are adding it
to create a nostalgic look.)
</P>
<P>
   I miss the chrome trim, and I bet original Miata owners will as
well. Also gone are the optional speakers built into the headrests,
another distinctive feature that I suspect others will miss.
</P>
<P>
   Still intimate, the inside of the Miata uses more rounded
surfaces and a dash that sweeps back onto the doors for a more
spacious feel. The use of door panels made of rounded
plastic-molded surfaces instead of the flat panels has allowed for
built-in door handles and storage pockets.
</P>
<P>
   Storage in the trunk has been increased 10 percent by moving the
spare tire and battery below the floor.
</P>
<P>
   The armrest-center console has been redesigned to include cup
holders, but they are not particularly convenient; they are at
elbow level and interfere with shifting.
</P>
<P>
   Thankfully, the Miata's seats continue to provide the same grip
and support of the original's, ideal for holding its passengers in
place on quick turns and sweeping bends.
</P>
<P>
   A significant improvement is the addition of a glass rear window
with a built-in defroster. The previous Miata required that the
plastic rear window be unzipped before lowering the top.
</P>
<P>
   Folding the top of the new Miata now is a simple one-person job
that can be performed without leaving the driver's seat _ at a
stoplight, for instance. Wind blockers have been added behind the
seats to prevent air that rushes over the rear of the vehicle from
swirling about in the passenger compartment.
</P>
<P>
   Other substantial changes were made under the skin.
</P>
<P>
   The Miata's 1.8-liter four-cylinder engine, the only engine
available, has been bolstered to 140 horsepower from 133. Torque
has also been improved slightly. While the differences don't look
huge on paper and only improve zero to 60-miles-an-hour performance
a scant half-second or so, the increased power and torque make the
car feel substantially faster taking off from stoplights and making
highway passing maneuvers.
</P>
<P>
   The engine is paired with a standard five-speed manual
transmission or the optional four-speed automatic, which has
undergone some improvement. Still, the stick shift is the best
choice for this sports car.
</P>
<P>
   Improvements have also been made in the Miata's four-wheel
double-wishbone suspension. Those, combined with the roadster's
more rigid body structure and lower weight, improve handling
noticeably.
</P>
<P>
   The new Miata has more grip going into corners and around curves
but provides a smoother ride. Yet, you can still fishtail the Miata
if that's your idea of a good time.
</P>
<P>
   The other feature that made the original Miata so attractive
remains as well: the price. The new Miata starts at $20,200
including destination fees. Fully outfitted, the Miata can be had
for under $25,000, about the same as its predecessor.
</P>
<P>
   The simple, classic design, the fun-to-drive performance and the
affordable price of the new Miata will maintain the Mazada's
position as the leader among roadsters for fun per dollar. &QL;

`SATURATION': UPROAR ALTERNATING WITH SERENITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JACK ANDERSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ An ambitious company called Complexions: A Concept in
Dance is letting a big production evolve. ``Saturation,''
choreographed by Dwight Rhoden, will achieve its finished form in
2000. But before that, bits of it will be shown as they take shape.
</P>
<P>
   Dancegoers got their first look at ``Saturation'' on Thursday
night in an unusual setting. The enterprising troupe, directed by
Rhoden and Desmond Richardson, found a temporarily vacant space at
15 Mercer St. in SoHo and turned it into a loft theater just for
this engagement, which concludes Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   The choreographic tone was set by the ``Ave Maria,'' which began
the program. Far from being pious, this was a passionate duet for
Christina Johnson and Ryan Brooke Taylor in which Rhoden
choreographically proclaimed the worth of flesh as well as spirit.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the current version of ``Saturation,'' a suite to a
potpourri of live and recorded music. Each section had a separate
title. But the choreography for all of them blended modern dance
with jazz dance and ballet, including steps on point. And the large
company proved admirably versatile.
</P>
<P>
   Turbulence prevailed. Dancers stormed and rushed, slithered and
squirmed. They rose on their toes, only to fall on the floor and
then rise again. No one ever seemed to rest.
</P>
<P>
   Carmen de Lavallade, an actress and dancer with a dignified
stage presence, was a guest artist for the occasion. Throughout the
production, she recited poetic texts in praise of the universe. But
although she has a fine speaking voice, she was hard to hear, for
the musical accompaniment occasionally drowned her out.
</P>
<P>
   That exemplified the problem of ``Saturation'' in its present
state. Rhoden made every sight and sound in it unremittingly
dazzling. Yet carefully devised contrasts between uproar and
serenity, and between simple and ornate steps, might have provided
the piece with even greater impact.

TOP CHINESE OFFICIAL REJECTS IDEA OF AUTONOMY FOR TIBET 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also: CHINA-SUMMIT, CHINA-TIANANMEN, CHINA-RUBIN) 
(ps) 
 By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ China's senior religious official Friday vehemently
rejected proposals, to be advanced by President Clinton during his
summit meeting on Saturday, that China engage in discussions with
the Dalai Lama over greater autonomy for Tibet.
</P>
<P>
   On the day Clinton arrived in Beijing for a state visit, the
official condemned the exiled Tibetan Buddhist leader as a relic of
the Dark Ages who wanted to trick China into letting the vast
mountainous territory on China's western border break away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Should we send Tibet back into the original feudal serfdom, so
dark, so savage, so cruel?'' asked Ye Xiaowen, director of State
Administration for Religious Affairs, of proposals to allow the
Dalai Lama to return and wield power. ``If so, what human rights
are we talking about?''
</P>
<P>
   Ye's remarks came in response to reporters' questions at a
government press briefing on religion in China.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is under pressure from Congress and rights advocates to
make China's rule in Tibet, which critics say is repressive, an
important issue in bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
   There appears to be no chance Clinton will make any progress
during his trip in defusing the Tibet issue, and American officials
have already said as much. And today, Ye criticized the
administration's appointment last year of a Special Coordinator on
Tibet as ``inappropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   Ye's statements Friday did not represent a change in policy for
the Chinese government, which has long mistrusted the Dalai Lama
and often condemns him in the harshest of terms.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, in an interview with the American
government-sponsored Radio Free Asia, Clinton said, ``We think it's
wrong to deny the Dalai Lama access to his people in Tibet,'' and
``We think it's wrong for the people of Tibet to be subject to any
sort of religious, cultural or economic discrimination.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton added that the United States does not seek independence
for Tibet, and that he understood China's historical fears of
disintegration.
</P>
<P>
   The Dalai Lama, spiritual and political leader to many Tibetan
Buddhists, fled Tibet in 1959 as the Chinese Communists crushed a
rebellion and began to remake the old society. He now lives in
exile in India.
</P>
<P>
   In recent statements, the Dalai Lama, who was awarded the 1989
Nobel Peace Prize, has said he does not seek independence, but
rather autonomy over civil affairs, with China retaining
sovereignty and control of foreign relations.
</P>
<P>
   But Ye said on Friday that the talk of autonomy was merely a
trick.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is turning a one-stage strategy for independence into a
two-stage strategy for independence,'' Ye said. If the Dalai Lama
continues on his current course, Ye said, he ``will meet
retribution according to the Buddhist scriptures.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a well-known fact that the Dalai Lama has betrayed his
motherland by going into foreign exile and has engaged in
separatist activities,'' Ye said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a matter of religious belief,'' he said. ``The
Chinese government has never interfered in the religious practices
and beliefs of the Tibetan people.''
</P>
<P>
   Ye acknowledged that during the Cultural Revolution of 1966 to
1976 religion was repressed throughout the People's Republic,
including Tibet, where many monasteries were destroyed and monks
imprisoned.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years the Chinese government has supported the
rebuilding of some monasteries and supported aspects of Tibetan
culture. But it has limited the numbers of monks and nuns and gone
to great lengths to weed out or imprison those deemed to support
the Dalai Lama.
</P>
<P>
   Although officially Tibet is an autonomous region with the
People's Republic, it remains tightly controlled by the Communist
Party.
</P>
<P>
   China is now promoting economic development in the region, which
it often trumpets in the official press.
</P>
<P>
   At the press briefing, Ye more broadly defended China's
religious policies, which have been attacked abroad as repressive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Chinese government has made relentless efforts to
guarantee its citizens freedom of religious belief,'' he said. ``At
the same time, we believe that the distinct features of each
country should be respected.''
</P>
<P>
   In China, that means that Christian churches that accept the
oversight of the government have been allowed to grow, even thrive.
But some evangelical Protestants who reject government control, and
Catholics who insist the pope is their spiritual leader, have faced
fines or arrest, leading to charges of religious persecution.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday morning, President and Mrs. Clinton will attend
services at the largest officially sanctioned Protestant church in
Beijing.

`LA JOLIE FILLE DE PERTH'': VAPID THEATER, EXHILARATING MUSIC 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By PAUL GRIFFITHS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Bizet's ``La Jolie Fille de Perth,'' which the Opera
Francais de New York revived at Alice Tully Hall on Thursday
evening, features a fiery and smoky gypsy mezzo, a tenor who is a
fool for love, a swaggering baritone and a chorus singing several
lusty numbers, all in an exotic setting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carmen,'' though, this is not. The plot, adapted from a Walter
Scott story, is innocuous, the characters bubble-thin. Opera
Francais' style of semi-staging suited the piece rather well. Here
were these fragile people, trapped in their love affairs and
intrigues to the front of the stage, at the mercy of the orchestral
machine behind them.
</P>
<P>
   And that machine was running smoothly. Not for the first time in
this company's history, a vapid piece of music theater was saved by
an exhilarating orchestral performance under Yves Abel. The zest,
attack and fineness of the playing suggested careful preparation
and pointed up where the qualities of the piece lie.
</P>
<P>
   Bizet no doubt found it difficult to care too much about the
inhabitants of a minor Scottish town in an indiscriminate
once-upon-a-time, but he evidently did care about a solo clarinet
or, especially, a detachment of cellos (beautifully represented on
this occasion). Where the orchestra is concerned, the score
constantly hovers on the borders of ``Carmen'' or of
``L'Arlesienne'' without quite coming up with what distinguishes
those works: strong tunes.
</P>
<P>
   Bizet imagined Catherine Glover, the Fair Maid of the title, as
a coloratura soprano and so created the rather awkward paradox of a
simple character expressing herself in ostentatiously ornamental
music. Tracy Dahl sang the role brightly and readily, though her
control was uncertain until the point in the fourth act where she
abruptly comes on with a mad song.
</P>
<P>
   Among the rest of the cast, Lyne Comtois was impressive as Mab,
the gypsy schemer, her singing rich in tone and dark in color, at
once sensuous and ironic. John Hancock, as the baritone Duc de
Rothsay, added likable singing to the strong effect of his stature:
There was welcome comedy when he fell to his knees beside Ms. Dahl
and was still taller than she was. Kevin Deas, a singer always good
to hear, did a lovely job with the part of Simon Glover, the Fair
Maid's father, and Gerard Edery gave a sterling performance as
Ralph, especially in his drinking song, the second such in the
opera. Gregory Mercer had the long role of Henri Smith, the hero.
</P>
<P>
   James Robinson staged the piece ably, though we could have done
without the vain attempts to signal things by illuminating one or
another of five tawdry hearts on the back wall. The vagaries of
love in this opera are clear enough and not really important.

 &HT;    Leaving home too often spells trouble in garden
 &HT;    By Lee May
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's a wonder gardeners ever leave home. When you do, you're
certain to miss something that sprouts, grows or blooms. Moreover,
you come back to face rampant growth _ like the myriad wisteria
vines whipping around my garden. Too, there's always the chance
that something might keel over and die for lack of attention.
</P>
<P>
   And for me, it seems that leaving home means a damaging storm is
sure to show up. At least that's what Lyn says. Going back several
years, she cites numerous occasions when big winds and rains,
including a hurricane, blew in just as I blew out. Lights are off,
I'm not home.
</P>
<P>
   Each time, I return to find something broken or killed in the
garden.
</P>
<P>
   One year, a huge pecan tree was uprooted in the courtyard behind
the house. Another time, a neighboring oak got snapped in two,
landing within feet of our fence.
</P>
<P>
   And last week, I was away again when the blowdown struck.
Reporting it on the phone, Lyn sounded calm; she'd seen it all
before: ``It broke a limb off one of the pines _ the limb you were
bending down by hanging the stone from it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, I was greeted by a roughly pruned Japanese black
pine (I'd been training that limb for years), as well as several
injured shrubs and an amazing number of broken branches, mostly
from the tulip tree, which uses any excuse to throw down its
various parts.
</P>
<P>
   All things considered, the damage was slight, the cleanup easy.
More difficult was my missing the dramatic appearance of the
amorphophallus, which is known in some places _ India, for example
_ as snake plant. It is also called voodoo lily, stink lily and
snake palm and leopard palm.
</P>
<P>
   By any name it is a striking plant.
</P>
<P>
   So striking that I cannot believe I would have failed to see it
spurting out of the ground. At the same time, I find it difficult
to believe it grew three feet during the week I was gone. In any
case, there it was, standing a yard high in the back garden, amid
the rhododendron, ferns, sweetshrub and sweetspire.
</P>
<P>
   Rising from ground level is a brown sheath, about 8 inches high.
Within that is the stalk _ green with white speckles. The top
sprays into three huge frondlike leaves. It's a very
vigorous-looking specimen.
</P>
<P>
   It began as a bulb, sent to me last October by Reese
Danley-Kilgo, a talented poet, author and gardener who lives in
Huntsville, Ala. She said a friend from India had noted that the
plant's snakelike appearance inspires one of its common names and
that it serves as camouflage for the reptiles.
</P>
<P>
   I planted the bulb the same day I got it, in a hole about 8
inches deep, covering the spot with decayed leaves _ protection
against cold and squirrels. Throughout the spring, I checked for
signs of life, seeing nothing as late as early June. Then, as soon
as I left town, the big stem shot up like a rocket.
</P>
<P>
   In describing the plant, some experts mention a bloom that comes
before the leaves. The large flower stinks, as my Alabama ancestors
would say, ``like k'yawn'' (it took me a long time to realize they
must have meant ``carrion'').
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, my plant did not bloom. All the more reason to
lament missing its rapid rise. Yet another reason to regret time
away from the garden.
</P>
<P>
   Reason enough to keep me home. Until the next storm gathers.

 &HT;    'Bernardin' offers insight into life of late cardinal
 &HT;    By John Blake
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Living saint, church icon, Christlike figure _ the late Cardinal
Joseph Bernardin is quickly becoming one of those transcendent
spiritual figures whose lives become the subjects of Sunday school
lessons.
</P>
<P>
   But Eugene Kennedy remembers Bernardin another way. They were
sitting on a Chicago pier, peering into a June sky one evening,
when Bernardin pointed toward a neon-lit Ferris wheel nearby.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you go for a ride on that, I'll go with you,'' Bernardin
said.
</P>
<P>
   That story is taken from a superb documentary on the life of
Bernardin. ``Bernardin,'' which airs Tuesday at 7 p.m. EDT on PBS
(Check local listings), is filled with rich glimpses into a man who
asked that people not regard him as a Catholic heavyweight, but as
``Joseph, your brother.''
</P>
<P>
   The hourlong film is filled with unexpected details: the Ferris
wheel story, Bernardin's encounter with the man who almost
destroyed his career, and recollections from a prominent Jewish
rabbi who saw Bernardin as his brother.
</P>
<P>
   Any new insight into the life of Bernardin is no small
achievement. He is now a spiritual celebrity. His memoirs, ``The
Gift of Peace'' (Loyola Press, $17.95), became a best seller. In
the slim volume, Bernardin details the final two battles of his
life _ one against a false charge of sexual misconduct and another
against cancer. Bernardin lost his final struggle, dying of cancer
at 68 just two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The documentary is produced by Journey Films, a company based in
Alexandria, Va. Martin Doblmeier, the film's co-producer, said
Bernardin intrigued him because his life was gripped by issues that
rock America: abortion, poverty, nuclear war, sexuality, death.
</P>
<P>
   Yet people primarily know Bernardin today through the sexual
misconduct charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole story was yet untold,'' Doblmeier said.
</P>
<P>
   The documentary fills in the blanks. It traces Bernardin's rise
from his childhood as an Italian Catholic in South Carolina to a
shrewd, inside worker in the Catholic Church. It relies on
interviews with family, friends, theologians, and even the longtime
companion of Bernardin's accuser, Steven Cook.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the film, Bernardin is portrayed by those who knew
him as a reconciler. He just didn't cross lines _ he erased them.
Jews, Protestants, African-Americans, the rich and poor, and even
the terminally ill, were drawn to Bernardin, Doblmeier said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a bridge builder,'' Doblmeier added. ``He built bridges
between left and right, between hawk and dove, between the accusers
and the accused, and then at the end of his life, as much as
humanely possible, he built a bridge between this life and what
lies beyond.''
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, the film is full of humor. Doblmeier and fellow
producer Frank Frost unearthed plenty of footage of Bernardin where
his self-deprecating humor was on display. Bernardin's gentleness,
his warmth with people, and his ability to inspire love from those
closest to him are also evident.
</P>
<P>
   In the final segment of the documentary, Kenneth Velo, his aide
and driver, gives a moving eulogy at his funeral.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a long and beautiful ride, Cardinal,'' Velo said as
he stood above Bernardin's casket. ``But now you're home.''

   The Howards called a pest-control expert. They gasped when he
pulled back the carpet to reveal warped, rotted floorboards.
</P>
<P>
   They soon discovered their Sherman Oaks residence had a case of
Poria incrassata _ a fast-moving, house-eating fungus with a
voracious appetite for wood.
</P>
<P>
   The termite inspector told them to call Luis De La Cruz, a Van
Nuys pest-control expert who is rapidly becoming known as the man
to call in Southern California when Poria strikes.
</P>
<P>
   De La Cruz broke through the sheetrock with a screwdriver,
reached in and pulled out a piece of wood. It crumbled in his fist.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were totally shocked,'' Sharon Howard recalled. ``He told
us it was spreading, like a cancer. It's silent and odorless, and
you don't know it's there. It was frightening.''
</P>
<P>
   Poria incrassata is one of many decay fungi that feed on dead
wood. Unlike most fungi that depend on moisture in the wood, Poria
supplies it's own water through rootlike tubes called rhizomorphs,
enabling it to move more quickly than other decay fungi.
</P>
<P>
   If conditions are right, Poria can destroy a room in less than a
year.
</P>
<P>
   Even worse, most homeowners have no idea the fungus is feasting
on their house until it's too late. The rhizomorphs grow from the
soil, usually entering the house from hidden, dank areas such as
crawl spaces and continuing unseen behind the walls and under
linoleum.
</P>
<P>
   By the time a homeowner notices the fungus in a cabinet, under a
sink or seeping from a carpet, the house has sustained severe
structural damage.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Poria was confined mainly to the Gulf States. But
lately, increasing numbers of Poria cases have been reported in
Southern California, said Wayne Wilcox, a wood pathologist studying
the fungus at the University of California Forest Products
Laboratory in Richmond.
</P>
<P>
   In the past 25 years, De La Cruz has handled nearly 200 cases of
Poria _ nearly 25 of them in the last year from Agoura to Encino to
Venice.
</P>
<P>
   Wilcox has found a similarity among houses with Poria: major
landscaping was done within two years of Poria's onset.
</P>
<P>
   He speculates that the soil dumped on these suburban lawns
originated in various forests around the world, where Poria occurs
naturally and helps in the process of decomposing fallen trees.
Poria may have come along for the ride.
</P>
<P>
   Although there is no practical way for a homeowner to make sure
the soil used in landscaping is not contaminated, homeowners can
eliminate the conditions that favor Poria _ darkness, stagnant air
and a water source.
</P>
<P>
   Common mistakes in new homes or with new landscaping that give
Poria an avenue of attack include improper grading that leaves too
little distance between the soil and the siding or the wood frame,
said Mark Savel, a Sherman Oaks architect who has investigated
homes with Poria problems.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, if stucco descends into the soil, rhizomorphs can
grow behind it.
</P>
<P>
   Other entry points for Poria include porches, decks and
trellaces that provide direct contact between wood and soil, or
planters that are built up against the siding of a house.
</P>
<P>
   Poorly ventilated crawl spaces, or those with remnants of tree
roots or construction debris, can also give Poria a point of entry.
</P>
<P>
   The Howards got off relatively easy. They lost a bedroom and a
portion of the bathroom to the fungus. Other people have lost
entire houses.
</P>
<P>
   Mathias and Kathy Mayer thought they had bought their dream
home, a 3,900-square-foot ranch-style house built in 1922.
</P>
<P>
   Less than two years after they moved in, Kathy Mayer noticed a
white and brown, mushroomlike substance on the carpet of her
daughter's room.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Howards, the Mayers of Chula Vista in San Diego County
thought it was something the cat left and wiped it up.
</P>
<P>
   A week later, there it was again _ in the same spot, and now,
also underneath the bed and along the baseboard.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband pulled back the carpet. As he stepped onto the
hardwood floor to get a closer look, it collapsed beneath him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had no idea what we were dealing with,'' Kathy Mayer said.
</P>
<P>
   They called the insurance company, which sent out a claims
inspector. When he leaned against the wall, he left an indentation.
They called a termite inspector, who told them to call De La Cruz.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I saw what was happening, I advised them to move out
immediately,'' De La Cruz said. ``I was afraid they were going to
be injured.''
</P>
<P>
   That weekend, the Mayers put their belongings in storage and,
with their two young children, went to live with her parents.
</P>
<P>
   It was the beginning of a two-year nightmare. Their insurance
company refused to cover the claim, so the Mayers filed a lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Mounting legal bills _ and the knowledge they were paying for a
home that was fast becoming unrepairable _ made it increasingly
difficult to pay the mortgage. The bank began foreclosure
proceedings, later joining the Mayers in the lawsuit. The insurance
company eventually settled for an amount the Mayers have agreed to
keep confidential.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our whole lives were turned upside down and inside out,''
Mayer said. ``It was emotionally and financially devastating.''
</P>
<P>
   The Howards' insurance company also turned down their $15,000
claim four times, even though their policy covered ``collapse due
to hidden decay.''
</P>
<P>
   The Howards filed a complaint with the state's Department of
Insurance. In arbitration, the judge sided with the Howards when
she saw a piece of Poria-infected wood fall apart to the touch.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said, `You don't think this constitutes collapse'?'' Joe
Howard recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Since his ordeal, Howard has helped other Poria victims weed
through their own insurance and legal battles.
</P>
<P>
   ``In most cases, the insurance company is going to say `no',''
Howard said. ``People have to be willing to fight. You have to show
them the light.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, most insurance policies exclude damage due to fungus
because it is considered the homeowner's responsibility to maintain
the house, said Kenneth Adams, a spokesman for Western Insurance
Information Service, an insurance industry-funded nonprofit
organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now is a good time for homeowners to get out and look at their
homes since we've had all that El Nino rain,'' Adams said.
</P>
<P>
   In a darkened room in his office in Van Nuys, De La Cruz
cultivates Poria in a glass-enclosed case that he uses during
presentations to other pest control experts.
</P>
<P>
   De La Cruz never intended to become Southern California's Poria
expert. But through word of mouth, contractors, insurance companies
and even his competitors in the termite business started referring
cases to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just snowballed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the glass case, a sheet of mycelium, made of tiny strands of
fungus thinner than hairs, fan out over a piece of drywall and
wood.
</P>
<P>
   When De La Cruz is called to investigate a case of wood decay,
it takes only a few minutes to determine the tell-tale signs of
Poria.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it may take me three or four hours to explain to the
homeowner why the recommendations we make are so drastic, to
demolish or break open major parts of the house.''
</P>
<P>
   Often, homeowners break down in tears.
</P>
<P>
   To eradicate Poria, De La Cruz begins by finding the point of
entry.
</P>
<P>
   Uncovering it is not pretty. He tears open walls and floors.
With a paintbrush and a few gardening tools, De La Cruz spends
hours digging around the foundation of a house, looking for
rhizomorphs.
</P>
<P>
   Poria has an appetite not only for common construction woods
such as oak and pine, but for cedar, redwood, cypress and juniper
that are naturally decay-resistant.
</P>
<P>
   Treated wood can slow Poria but not necessarily stop it because
only the outer layer is protected. If cracks develop in the wood,
Poria can get to the untreated core.
</P>
<P>
   Many homeowners make the mistake of repairing damaged
floorboards or rooms before they realize Poria is the culprit. But
this only makes matters worse.
</P>
<P>
   With fresh wood to devour, Poria comes back with a vengeance. To
eliminate the problem, he must sever the arteries that carry the
water from the soil.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sad,'' he said. ``You have to act fast to save whatever
remains of your house.''

WIN THE WAR AGAINST PORIA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENIFER HANRAHAN 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Houses that are poorly constructed are most
susceptible to Poria incrassata. The best way for homeowners or
homebuyers to make sure they are protected is to hire a termite
inspector who is familiar with the conditions that favor Poria and
the signs of infestation.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, many pest-control experts are not.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Willis, president of the League of California Homeowners,
recently discovered vinelike tubes growing through decorative wood
trellises at his Upland home.
</P>
<P>
   Willis suspected he had Poria after reading a description of it
in a magazine. He called a pest-control expert he had employed for
years, but the man had never heard of Poria.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't assume that the experts know,'' Willis said. ``Ask
questions and make sure.''
</P>
<P>
   According to a report prepared for the U.S. Department of
Agriculture, Forest Service and the Department of Housing and Urban
Development, Poria warning signs include:
</P>
<P>
   _Sunken areas in baseboards or trim, or separation of the
baseboard from the floor.
</P>
<P>
   _Whitish mats of mycelium under carpets or linoleum, in cabinets
or even behind furniture. Poria is susceptible to drying out in
sunlight or high temperatures, so it prefers unventilated, dark
areas, usually basements or crawl spaces.
</P>
<P>
   _The presence of fruit bodies on rotten wood on the underside of
flooring or in a cabinet. Fruit bodies are flat, succulent, up to a
half-inch thick and a pale olive gray, brown or black.
</P>
<P>
   _Swelling or crumbling of plaster or sheetrock, usually in a
straight, vertical column where it is fastened to a wall stud.
</P>
<P>
   _Vinelike rhizomorphs branching from the soil to foundations,
framing or the underside of flooring. They are dirty white, brown
or black.
</P>
<P>
   _Some seemingly innocuous projects or problems around the house
also can give Poria a chance to attack, including:
</P>
<P>
   _Building up flower beds so that the soil touches siding.
</P>
<P>
   _Wetting walls with lawn sprinklers for long periods. This can
allow the fungus to form rhizomorphs that connect the soil to the
wood, so that even after the sprinklers are shut off, the decay
continues.
</P>
<P>
   _Plumbing leaks.
</P>
<P>
   _Piling wood or other debris in crawl spaces or against the
sides of a house.

`BAYWATCH' HUNK SAYS `SLIP! SLOP! SLAP!'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BARBARA DE WITT 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; It's summer _ and time to fry your skin in the
name of fashion. But before you butter your bod, listen up.
According to hunky ``Baywatch'' star Jose Solano, you're supposed
to ``Slip! Slop! Slap!''
</P>
<P>
   Solano, the new spokesman for the American Cancer Society Skin
Protection Federation, is asking sun worshipers to slip on a shirt,
slop on sunscreen (SPF 15 and higher) and slap on a hat. He also
suggests avoiding the midday sun _ it's the most damaging to your
skin.
</P>
<P>
   Now, if you want to fake it, try Origins Summer Vacation, the
all-natural cosmetic company's first fake tanning cream, priced at
$17.50. It gives a golden glow on darker complexions but looks a
tad fake (dark) on pale ``Snow White'' skin. And for that
sun-streaked look in your hair without bleach, Origins has
introduced Change Your Locks hair-streaking sticks in such colors
as Golden, Honey and Bronze, priced at $14. Miz Hot Tips discovered
it's not a mascara wand but a giant pencil that you get wet and
glide directly onto the hair and it stays put until you wash it
out. It's cool.
</P>
<P>
   While you're working on your tan (fake or otherwise), you'll
have time to read something that requires no brain power, since
it's mostly pictures. It's ``The Brewer Twins: Double Take''
(Universe; $17.95) by Derek and Keith Brewer, the Redondo Beach
surfer boys who became supermodels.
</P>
<P>
   FORGET STARBUCKS: Hate spending big bucks for the taste of
lattes to linger on your lips? The Bare Escentuals shops (there's
one at Topanga Plaza in Canoga Park), have a nifty idea called Buzz
Latte for Lips. It's a sheer gloss that smells and tastes like
coffee, because it's made with real coffee, priced at $12.
</P>
<P>
   If you just want the look of iced mocha, with vitamins A and E
added to soothe dry lips, try Trucco's new Ice Queen by Trucco (a
division of Sebastian International), priced at $6.50.
</P>
<P>
   ON THE DOWN SIDE: Maybe you've been buzzing all day at the
office, and what you're really looking for is a luxurious downer.
To chase the office demons out of your mind, try Bare Escentuals'
new Peace and Quiet foaming bath and body balm for $10. Miz Hot
Tips soaked in it and found it swell, especially with soft violin
music and a glass of valpolicella. But that's up to you.
</P>
<P>
   An alternative is Connie Stevens' new executive day spa and
boutique called the Garden Sanctuary, which opens today at 426 S.
Robertson Blvd., Los Angeles. The bubbly singer-actress from the
'60s and '70s (and mom of actress Joely Fisher) has done so well in
the cosmetics business on the Home Shopping Network that she
decided to have her own place, offering relaxing herbal and
aromatherapy body wraps and massages, fake tan applications and
reflexology treatments. The number is (310) 288-3024.
</P>
<P>
   BABE WATCH: So, you've mowed the lawn and scrubbed the toilets.
Now you're ready for some fun at the mall? Take note that the Fresh
Faces Model Search begins at noon today at Bloomingdale's in the
Beverly Center, and the celebrity judges are Channon Roe of ``Can't
Hardly Wait'' and Jason Young of ``The Bold and the Beautiful.''
Winners receive a modeling contract with L.A. Models Agency and
gifts from Bloomingdale's.
</P>
<P>
   KIDDIE FUN: Does your little angel have a birthday coming up?
Songs such as ``Pool Party'' and ``Pinata Party'' will liven things
up, and you'll find them included in the new CD release ``You're
Invited to Mary Kate &AMP; Ashley's Birthday Party.'' It's about $16 at
the usual music outlets.

CHINESE ASSURE RUBIN THEY DO NOT PLAN A CURRENCY DEVALUATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also: CHINA-SUMMIT, CHINA-TIBET, CHINA-TIANANMEN) 
(th) 
 By MARK LANDLER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ On the day before President Clinton was scheduled to
get down to business with President Jiang Zemin, China on Friday
gave the United States its strongest assurances yet that it does
not plan to devalue its currency.
</P>
<P>
   Playing economic advance man for Clinton, U.S. Treasury
Secretary Robert Rubin held a daylong series of meetings with
senior Chinese officials here, in which he said ``there were
unambiguous statements of intent to maintain'' the exchange rate of
the Chinese currency, the yuan.
</P>
<P>
   Persuading China to maintain a stable currency has become a top
priority of the Clinton administration, which fears that a
devaluation by Beijing could spark another wave of copycat
devaluations across Asia. Rubin praised China on Friday for being
an ``island of stability'' in a region buffeted by economic
turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   Countries that devalue their currency can usually sell their
goods more competitively, and the concern of the United States and
several other nations is that the Chinese would devalue to avoid
being disadvantaged by several other Asian countries whose currency
has been weakened from the economic crisis that has shaken the
region.
</P>
<P>
   Although Friday's meetings were held in Zhongnanhai, the walled
compound in the heart of Beijing that is the inner sanctum of the
Chinese government, the focus of the talks was hundreds of miles to
the east, in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Asia's latest economic relapse was caused by a sharp decline in
the Japanese yen, and Rubin used the meetings here to keep up the
pressure on Japan to mend its fractured economy. He said that
Chinese officials told him they were very concerned about the
economic turmoil in Japan, in large part because the weak yen was
having an ``adverse impact on the region.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I said that we, too, were deeply concerned about the economic
condition in Japan,'' said Rubin in a briefing with reporters after
he met Prime Minister Zhu Rongji, who is leading China's economic
reforms.
</P>
<P>
   The contrast between a stable, reform-minded China and a shaky,
equivocating Japan has become a favorite theme of policy-makers and
currency traders in recent months. While Rubin was careful not to
criticize Japan, he drew some pointed distinctions between Beijing
and Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   Of the Chinese decision not to devalue, Rubin said, ``They were
very prescient and they are getting and deserve a great deal of
respect in the world for this decision.'' Of Japan, he said, ``I've
not spoken to any person in the financial or political world who
does not believe Japan must solve its problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the drop in the yen prompted the United States and
Japan to prop up the value of the currency by buying $4 billion of
yen in foreign exchange markets. Many financial experts believe
China played an influential role in forcing the intervention by
complaining about how the weak yen was hurting its exports and by
dropping hints that the yuan might have to be devalued.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, before their morning meeting, the Chinese central bank
governor, Dai Xianglong, made a show of thanking Rubin for the
intervention. Dai had been among the Chinese officials who raised
alarms in recent weeks about how a weak yen was putting pressure on
the yuan.
</P>
<P>
   But the effects of the move have largely worn off. After a brief
rebound, the yen has settled to about 142 to the dollar, and
currency traders are once again betting on when the United States
will be forced to buy yen to raise its value again.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin was resolutely noncommittal Friday about whether the
United States would continue propping up the yen. But he is known
to be skeptical about the efficacy of such interventions. He would
clearly prefer that Japan tackle its more deep-seated economic
problems, which include a banking sector that staggers under $600
billion in bad loans and a web of onerous financial regulations.
</P>
<P>
   As for China, Rubin said it, too, faced formidable economic
challenges. Zhu is embarking on a broad reform of China's banking
system, as well as privatizing thousands of state-owned
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   ``You certainly got the feeling of people who understand the
problems,'' Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the Chinese leaders are sticking to their forecast of 8
percent economic growth in 1998. But with exports dwindling and
domestic demand sluggish, he added, ``It's not clear where they
expect to come out.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the questions about China's economy, this was
probably the most trouble-free stop on Rubin's trip. In the coming
week, he will travel to Malaysia, Thailand and South Korea _
countries that are grappling with more nettlesome problems than
slowing growth.
</P>
<P>
   In Malaysia, Rubin will face a potentially unstable political
environment. On Wednesday, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahatir Mohamad
named his close adviser, Daim Zainuddin, as a cabinet minister in
charge of the economy. That would appear to undercut Deputy Prime
Minister Anwar Ibrahim, who had overseen the economy and has been
widely considered to be Mahatir's heir apparent.
</P>
<P>
   Ibrahim has clashed publicly with his boss in recent weeks over
how Malaysia should respond to the economic downturn. Although
Ibrahim says he is loyal to Mahatir, political experts in Malaysia
believe Ibrahim might challenge him if he felt he was being shunted
out of power.
</P>
<P>
   In Thailand and Korea, the governments are struggling to impose
harsh economic reforms mandated by the International Monetary Fund
in the face of mounting opposition from labor leaders and populist
politicians. &QL;

DOGGED PATH TO MAKING OF `DR. DOLITTLE'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; There was only one conceivable reason to remake
``Dr. Dolittle,'' 20th &UR;  &LR; Century Fox's notorious, 1967 children's
musical that cost a mint and flopped big time.
</P>
<P>
   That reason was the new computer graphics technology, showcased
so winningly three years ago in ``Babe,'' that could really make
this grandaddy of all talking animal stories sing on the screen.
</P>
<P>
   A funny thing happened on the way to the new ``Dr. Dolittle,''
though.
</P>
<P>
   While designing the new movie as a contemporary Eddie Murphy
comedy rather than the period musical based more faithfully on Hugh
Lofting's series of kids books, director Betty Thomas discovered
that live animals could have better senses of humor than virtual
ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say what you see on screen is 95 percent live animals,''
explains Thomas, the former ``Hill Street Blues''
star-turned-director of such meta-media comedies as ``The Brady
Bunch Movie,'' ``Private Parts'' and HBO's ``The Late Shift.'' ``I
think that's a new high. We didn't start out trying to do that, but
they learned a lot and were so responsive.''
</P>
<P>
   In the new version, Murphy plays successful San Francisco
physician John Dolittle who, on the eve of a profitable merger
between his clinic and a ghastly HMO, finds his long-repressed
childhood ability to communicate with animals has returned. He's
soon, um, badgered by a homeless mutt named Lucky (voiced by Norm
Macdonald), dissed by his daughter's guinea pig (Chris Rock),
cornered into trying to help a pain-wracked, suicidal tiger (Albert
Brooks) and generally considered the man to see for what ails all
manner of yakkety beasts.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, Dolittle wants nothing less than to be on a bunch of
wisecracking critters' wavelengths. But he eventually comes around
to accepting his mission of helping the fur-bearing and fowl _
which, of course, makes everyone think he's gone nuts.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas admits she must have been a little nuts to take on this
assignment. But she had great help from head animal trainer Mark
Forbes and some 40 other beastie specialists (each species had its
own trainer), and from visual-effects supervisor Jon Farhat, who
oversaw the work of dozens of digital artists at CG outfits around
the globe to make the talking animals come to life.
</P>
<P>
   Wait a minute. Didn't Thomas say practically all of the animals
were real? Well, yes, but . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``They're live animals, but we put CG facial parts on them,''
says Farhat, who admits this job was tougher than the astonishing
transformation work his team performed for Murphy's last hit, ``The
Nutty Professor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to do something different from the other
talking-animal shows, which was: If it didn't look like it could be
done with the facial muscles those animals had, we wouldn't do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still easier for a dog to move its mouth than for a
computer to fake it, so we relied, mostly, on what the animal's
sense of good acting was,'' Farhat continues. ``Rather than obsess
over believable lip movements, if we could get something across
with an eye expression or a nose scrunch, we did that. The other
thing was, even though they could be trained to do all kinds of
things, the animals couldn't necessarily do them at the right time
or exactly the same way through repeated takes. That's also where
the computers came in.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes, of Birds and Animals Unlimited, has been supplying
trained critters to the entertainment industry for 10 years,
including such multipup jobs as ``101 Dalmatians.''
</P>
<P>
   But the big menagerie of species and demanding nature of
``Dolittle's'' character comedy made this the hardest job of his
career.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were two big challenges,'' Forbes notes. ``One was the
whole talking aspect, which involved a lot of CG and motion-control
camera work (in which a take is reshot several times with different
elements each run-through that are then composited together but
which requires any recurring element to look and move exactly the
same each time). You'd have to get a tiger to move an inch that way
or a dog to cock his head at precisely the right angle. That was so
exacting, as opposed to just throwing a bunch of animals into a
room.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other thing was the number of different animals working
together in the same scene. It's one thing to have a well-trained
dog, or even a tiger, working by themselves. But different animals
together compounds problems like crazy. You not only have the
individual animals listening to their particular trainers _ who all
have different sound signals, whistles or whoops or what have you,
that drive the human actors nuts _ but they all have to be getting
along with each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``And though you can train a lot of animals to tolerate one
another ... we had to shoot the tiger and owls, the preying
animals, separately.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there was that other difficult creature, Eddie Murphy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people are animal people, some just aren't,'' Forbes says
with a shrug.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eddie sure isn't an animal person,'' Thomas says in a less
philosophical tone of voice. ``Nobody told me that when I started
this movie. And of course Fox, in all their wisdom, was
broadcasting `When Animals Attack!' all during this shoot, which
was great for Eddie to see.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took awhile, it really did, for him to get comfortable with
them, but he realized he had to. And I got him to do a lot of
things with the animals that he swore he never would.''
</P>
<P>
   For Thomas, in the end, the computers proved more frustrating
than either the human actors or their furry and feathered friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``First we recorded the animal characters' voices, then played
them back for Eddie while he tried to do the scene,'' she explains.
``Then he'd come up with new stuff, and we'd go back to the animal
voice actors and they'd invent new gags and lines, especially after
they saw what their animal could do. So there was all this
improvisation going on, which drove the special-effects guys crazy.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the toughest thing, for me, was feeling cut off from the
group of special-effects humans. I knew the computer people were
really creating the performances. I wanted to be there every day
with them, but they were literally in Canada and Paris, as well as
Santa Monica, so you feel like you're no longer in control of that.
When you suddenly get a funny idea or a new line that you want to
add, everyone says, `Are you nuts?' We already spent $25,000 on
this line!''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes, too, is ambivalent about the wonders of mixing
irrational animals and virtual technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first you want to think CG will make your job easier,'' he
says. ``It doesn't. It makes the training more complicated. Now,
animals have to do the exact thing at a certain point in time and
space to match everything else. But on the other hand, you're able
to do a lot more things than you could before.''
</P>
<P>
   Farhat explains that the trick is in sticking with what your
living, breathing performer does best; in other words, the process
employed in making ``Dr. Dolittle.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't use technology to make it look real when you've got
reality sitting in front of you,'' he says. ``That's the toughest
thing to maintain, because producers think you can generate
anything in CG. But you want to change reality, not make reality.''
</P>
<P>
   And as for the more organically oriented professionals'
complaints about high-tech filmmaking, Farhat points out that it's
a two-way street.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the hardest things was taping the tiger for our
computer models, getting him to look scared and all of that,''
Farhat recalls. ``He didn't get along with people very well, you
know. But he liked me, I guess, because he _ how do you say it? _
marked me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Talk about Hollywood being a town where you get pi---d on. I
think I paid my dues.''

SCHOLARS LOOK AT BASEBALL AND SEE THE AMERICAN ESSENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By EDWARD A. GARGAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   COOPERSTOWN, N.Y. _ Beyond the chalk lines that arrow into lush
green outfields, beyond the packed dirt and the pristine white
bases, beyond the dugouts and the scoreboards that chart wins and
losses, and beyond the thousands of baseball players who have
lashed away at pitched balls, there is a grander Elysian field: it
is, simply, the idea and meaning of baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Every June for the last decade, a gaggle of academics
historians, anthropologists, linguists and sociologists gather at
this shrine to the game of summer to talk baseball, not as it is
played but what it means, how it shapes a culture, how it
conditions language, how it touches the soul. They come, these
scholars, in baseball hats clamped over bald pates or white hair,
and polo shirts stretched over bellies more intimate with beer than
situps, to ruminate on the game of which Walt Whitman wrote:
</P>
<P>
   ``Well it's our game; that's the chief fact in connection with
it: America's game; it has the snap, go, fling of the American
atmosphere; it belongs as much to our institutions, fits into them
as significantly as our Constitution's laws; is just as important
in the sum total of our historic life.''
</P>
<P>
   Philosophizing about baseball has not, of course, remained the
preserve of academia; indeed, from political pundits like George
Will to Canadian novelist W.P. Kinsella, the stadium of rumination
remains vast. But for scholars, particularly scholars who may once
have dreamed of walking onto the field of a major league ball park,
the game and its place in American life is rich in both symbolism
and meaning; it is for many, despite its many problems, an axis on
which the American experience turns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of what is written about baseball is very narrow,'' said
Peter Rutkoff, a professor of history at Kenyon College in the
small Ohio town of Gambier, ``or baseball nuts writing for baseball
nuts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We say right up front,'' chimed in Alvin Hall, now a dean and
historian at the Union Institute in Cincinnati and founder of the
yearly symposium, ``that we're not interested in baseball as
baseball, but baseball as part of American culture. Baseball is
regarded as a quintessential American sport. So to understand
American culture, you have to understand baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet because these scholars claim they come here not so much to
praise baseball, there was at first a grumble of skepticism from
the guardians of the Hall of Fame about a group of (nearly all) men
who didn't care so much about scores and earned run averages or who
was the best shortstop of the 1950s. Why should the Hall, where
greatness is arrayed on bronze plaques in a nave of marble and
bleached wood, admit philosophers and linguists and historians into
its embrace, it was said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' said Hall, ``I think we demonstrated to them the
educational function of a meeting like this. And the museum at the
Hall is the broader base of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, the symposium, which is sponsored by the Hall of Fame and
the State University of New York at Oneonta and whih draws between
70 and 120 scholars each year, is as much a part of Cooperstown's
summer rituals as the All-Star Game is to major league ball.
</P>
<P>
   Over three days in mid-June, the scholars, who hailed from both
coasts and much in between, surveyed the landscape of American
culture and the role of baseball, from issues of sexuality to
notions of leadership theory, from unionization to melancholy in
American life.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the outfield of ideas and reflection about baseball
seems to be without fences. Part of the Americanizing ritual
smoldering just below the surface of baseball, Thomas Altherr, a
historian at Metropolitan State College in Denver, told his
colleagues, is the pervasive sexuality that surrounds the game.
</P>
<P>
   From the reckless and relentless womanizing of many players to
condoms carrying the image of Ted Williams (the last batter to hit
over .400), even to ancient baseball-like fertility rituals.
</P>
<P>
   How ancient? ``In Mesopotamia, on the first of May, young women
underwent a puberty ritual in which they batted a rock across a
field and ran around it to ensure fertility,'' Altherr said, ``In
an additional rite, the women circled a path of four bases, each
corresponding symbolically to their own infancy, childhood,
adulthood and finally full womanhood.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet as Altherr pointed out, in the 19th century, baseball was
shrouded in a culture of prudishness, so much so that Ladies Days
were held so that women in the stands could provide a calming
effect on frenzied male fans. That, of course, has given way, he
said, to endless braggadocio of sexual prowess among ball players,
beginning most notably, and perhaps most appropriately, with Babe
Ruth, arguably the greatest batter of all time.
</P>
<P>
   Where this evolution of attitudes will lead, Altherr says, is
uncertain. ``Will baseball be more sexualized?'' he asked. ``How
long will it be before we have Dallas Cowboy cheerleaders? So far,
thank goodness, there's nothing like that glitzy sexuality.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanton Green, a bearded anthropologist from Pittsburgh's
Clarion University, argued that baseball, as an Americanizing
ritual, is a very important part of the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the chronicle of immigrants to this country,'' Green
suggested, ``baseball has been very much a mirror of the rise and
assimilation of ethnic groups, from early Irish to the most recent
arrivals, the Japanese. The transition from Jackie Robinson to Nomo
_'' a celebrated but now troubled Japanese pitcher ``_ is a fairly
interesting reminder of this country's immigration pattern. Now,
Latin American and Asian ball players are the new immigrants.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The consequence,'' he said, ``is that the next generation of
baseball will be more global than we're used to.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Green said there is a second, and ultimately more troubling
question, however, and that is whether the game will cease to
remain a lynchpin between generations, a vehicle by which the
elements of American culture are passed from grandfather to father
to son.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baseball has played a role in transforming children, at least
boys, into adults,'' he explained. ``Now, that's less true.
Baseball is not so much part of that initiation anymore.
Generations are cut off more. As Margaret Meade has pointed out,
the generation gap is really a culture gap, a gap in passing on
culture from one generation to the next.''
</P>
<P>
   In part, Green argued, this is because baseball has itself
changed and, as a result, what it means to children, mostly boys,
today is different from the meaning and role in children's lives in
previous generations.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, he suggested, it has become very difficult to
identify individual players with individual teams simply because
ball players move relatively easily from one team to the next. On
the other, the presentation of baseball has been transformed from
one where the game itself remained the centerpiece to a spectacle
of gifts, flashing scoreboards, dancing grounds keepers. ``Kids
want to go to the game for whatever trinket they're getting, not
for the baseball,'' he said, somewhat ruefully. ``Baseball was part
of my initiation. That's not so true anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   If this is so, he asked, it is an open question whether baseball
will continue to remain central to the Americanizing experience of
earlier immigrant generations.
</P>
<P>
   For some at the symposium, baseball touches the most profound
emotional level of existence. ``While the game displays a
significant physical beauty and radiates a spiritual
transcendence,'' said George Grella, a professor of English at the
University of Rochester, ``it also expresses the parallel
paradoxical quality of sadness.''
</P>
<P>
   Although such cultural observations veer dangerously toward the
mawkish (or worse, the pompous), a decided risk when people unleash
their rhetorical powers on the game of baseball, Grella and others
strove to cement their arguments with evidence.
</P>
<P>
   And for Grella, the stuff of sadness is voluminous, from the
solitary positioning of fielders to the wreckers' ball at Ebbets
Field. As Carl Yastrzemski, the great Boston Red Sox catcher who
was the last man to win the Triple Crown, said: ``I loved the game.
I loved the competition. But I never had any fun. I never enjoyed
it. All hard work, all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   In an essay he called ``The Melancholy of Baseball,'' Grella
suggested to his fellow scholars and baseball fans that the
ambiguity of the game echoes the voices of mainstream culture. ``If
baseball celebrates youth,'' he said, ``it also reminds us of
mortality; if a game can last forever, it is also an ephemeral
endeavor; it usually inspires lyric poetry, but also lends itself
to the elegiac mode. . . . it instructs us in two crucial American
concepts, the loneliness of space and the sadness of time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It creates an immense green field, a gorgeous vista invoking
the pastoral, the agricultural, even the peaceable kingdom, but it
hints that the lush green garden may also be a vale of tears.
Baseball is the saddest game.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so sad, though, that the scholars refrained from crowding
around Clete Boyer, a former Yankee great, who graced the occasion
with his presence. And not so melancholy that a game of Town Ball,
an early 19th-century precursor of the modern game, played by
competing squads of slow-moving academics, ended in a redemptive
tie, 21-21.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's two sides to this conference,'' laughed Kenyon's
Rutkoff, a gangly man whose eyes glitter at the sight of a bat and
ball. ``There's the academics. But there's also the little kid
worshipping their heroes.''

KRALL AND SHEARING: LOW-KEY TALENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Diana Krall is about the farthest thing from a jazz
diva you could expect to find in a world where loud, pyrotechnic
vocal display is confused with musical insight and emotional depth.
This singer and pianist, who led her trio in a quietly enthralling
concert on Thursday night at Carnegie Hall as part of the JVC Jazz
Festival, is a low-key jazz minimalist who takes the meaning of the
word ``trio'' much more seriously than most singers.
</P>
<P>
   Working with Russell Malone, a phenomenally fluent and tasteful
guitarist, and the bassist Ben Wolfe, Ms. Krall shapes popular
standards into lovely, ever-evolving instrumental conversations, in
which the music and rhythmic accents keep changing color, the hues
remaining pastel. On top of the trio's inventive musical dynamics,
Ms. Krall brings a lyrical intelligence that is bracingly
unsentimental.
</P>
<P>
   In Ms. Krall's hands, ``All or Nothing at All'' wasn't a
swooning ballad about giving in to love but a cool explanation of
why she would continue to resist a lover's charms. Instead of a
heart-pounding declaration, ``I've Got You Under My Skin'' became
an expression of worry and possible regret about getting too deeply
involved.
</P>
<P>
   The most impressive and touching performance on Thursday was a
subtly iconoclastic rendition of ``How Deep Is the Ocean?'' which
Ms. Krall dedicated to her piano teacher Jimmy Rowles, who died two
years ago. The trio's version of the Irving Berlin chestnut elided
the song's eight-bar phrases so that the melody remained unbroken.
The quieter Ms. Krall's singing became, the more feeling she
projected.
</P>
<P>
   As refreshing as it was, Ms. Krall's understatement seemed
almost brutally self-effacing. A discreet showmanship does have its
place in jazz, especially in jazz singing. But the blonde,
photogenic singer appeared determined to keep her set as purely
musical as possible, offering only the sparest commentary between
numbers and never reaching out to an audience that gave her a
partial standing ovation.
</P>
<P>
   George Shearing, who performed during the second half of the
evening with his trio, is as musically mild-mannered in his way as
Ms. Krall. Appearing with Reg Schwager on guitar and Neil Swinson
on bass, this 78-year-old English pianist played a pleasant,
impeccably precise set that suggested the pacifying musical
equivalent of comfort food.
</P>
<P>
   The material ran to pretty tunes like ``Lollipops and Roses''
and ``Sunday, Monday or Always,'' in which the melodies in
Shearing's blocked chords were doubled by the guitar to create
bell-like sonorities. Genuine poignancy broke through the decorum
only once, in ``Only the Lonely,'' Shearing's richly harmonized
unaccompanied solo tribute to Frank Sinatra.

&HT;     ELECTRONIC COURTROOM OFFERS A LOOK AT TRIALS OF THE FUTURE
</HEADLINE>
     &HT;     By SAMAR ABULHASSAN 
 &HT;     c. 1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ You won't hear much paper shuffling in Courtroom
No. 9, the most coveted room in U.S. District Court here.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving heaps of paper evidence at home, attorneys instead use a
bar code pen to scan numbers off of a sheet that stores their
evidence. Once the document appears on the screen in the
courtroom's control center, it is transmitted to monitors placed in
the jury box, counsel tables, the judge's bench and the witness
stand.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers lobby six months in advance to try their cases in the
state-of-the-art, $128,000 courtroom. One of ten in federal courts
nationwide, it's considered a model for how technology can speed
the wheels of justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the purpose of a trial is the search for truth, this allows
the fact finder to be more thorough and efficient,'' said Luke
Bierman, judicial division director of the American Bar
Association.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say this type of fully-integrated technological
courtroom is the wave of the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within a short period of time, every courtroom is going to
have some of this technology,'' said Barry Boss, a defense attorney
who tried the first case in Washington's facility.
</P>
<P>
   As glitches are being fixed in the year-old courtroom, federal
court officials are considering whether to install another one.
</P>
<P>
   The electronic courtroom, the first of its kind in U.S. District
Court here, has drawn visitors from as far as Israel and Kenya. It
was paid for from fees that lawyers must routinely pay to practice
in federal court.
</P>
<P>
   The courtroom's gadgets include software that records testimony
as it is being spoken, a souped-up sound system for playing
audio-taped evidence and an overhead projector that can blow up
evidence and display it throughout the courtroom. Also, a witness
can circle a suspect in crime scene photograph using a ``John
Madden pen,'' long employed by sportscasters and weather announcers
but new to courtrooms. A 37-inch television monitor allows those in
the audience to get a better view of the proceedings, including
enlarged views of evidence.
</P>
<P>
   In some courtrooms, computer and video wires ran amok. In this
state-of-art courtroom, however, they are tucked away under a
four-inch-high raised floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should look like a courtroom and feel like a courtroom,''
said U.S. District Judge Thomas Hogan. ``It shouldn't look like a
Circuit City showroom.''
</P>
<P>
   In the ``electronic courtroom,'' jurors no longer wait for
documents to be handed to them or squint to see physical evidence.
Now, they can study evidence longer on eight 10-inch monitors in
the jury box.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers scan documents, photographs or even video clips into
computers before the proceedings begin. Each one receives a bar
code. Once the trial starts, the lawyers simply highlight bar codes
from a ``menu'' of evidence, and the evidence pops up on the
courtroom monitors.
</P>
<P>
   This system, Hogan said, allow greater scrutiny of evidence by
jurors. For example, a jury often has a limited view of such
objects as X-rays, photographs or guns. But with a high-powered
overhead ``ELMO'' projector, the image of a gun can be enlarged.
</P>
<P>
   The heart of the operation is the control center ``podium'' from
which an attorney can zoom in on details of evidence, such as
fingerprints.
</P>
<P>
   And if the judge decides that the jury shouldn't see certain
images, the courtroom deputy can tap a ``kill switch'' that shuts
off certain monitors.
</P>
<P>
   The judge's bench also holds a docking station, where he or she
can plug in a laptop computer. This allows the judge to check
e-mail, do legal research or view real-time testimony.
</P>
<P>
   The technology can mean speedier trials, attorneys and judges
say. It also means jurors are more alert during trials.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have fewer jurors sleeping,'' said Betsy Paret, chief
deputy for court administration. She has conducted training
sessions for lawyers with court budget analyst John Cramer.
</P>
<P>
   Jurors are ``curious to see what's going to happen next,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   This makes sense to defense attorney Boss, who tried the first
case in the electronic courtroom nearly a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because we're so used to obtaining everything over a video
screen, the electronic courtroom allows us to take an antiquated
form of presentation and make it current and contemporary,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Boss, who tried a federal weapons possession case in the
courtroom, said the technology helped him weed out inconsistencies
in the testimonies of police officers. His client was acquitted in
about an hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my closing argument, I was able to juxtapose the real-time
testimony of both the officers on the monitor,'' he said. ``It
revealed to the jury the stark contradiction between the two
accounts.''

CURTAILING THE GOP'S INVESTIGATION MACHINE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, June 28 1998)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the great things about our country is the way you are
free to bad-mouth those in authority, a blessed relief valve for
two-and-a-quarter centuries, a tenet that has probably prevented
three or four more revolutions or civil wars than the one of each
we already survived.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many of the current president's enemies in Congress and
in the country, I am in favor of having Mr. Clinton go to China.
And unlike most of them, I am also in favor of having him come
back.
</P>
<P>
   Every president who goes to China has to watch his step, never
mind the water, the food, the luggage. Because the relationship
between the largest country on earth (them), and the most powerful
(us) is fraught with fear of being taken for granted, of losing
face. That goes for us as much as them.
</P>
<P>
   We are very insecure vis a vis the 1.2 billion Chinese. For
decades after World War II, the conservative politicians in this
country made hay with the war whoop: ``Who lost China?'' A lot of
us younger Americans wondered: How can you lose the most populous
nation on the planet? One that we never ``had'' to begin with?
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the miracle of television, any congressman, senator,
or preacher with his own television network or talk show can
denounce the president for a.) going b.) kowtowing to c.) groveling
at the feet of d.) toadying up to, etc., the Butchers of Beijing.
It's always an irresistible opportunity for the opposition party
here to wax wroth about whatever president is doing to whatever
Chinese regime. If your sound bite is particularly pithy or
insulting, you get onto the cable network loop, and can lie awake
for 24 hours straight to catch yourself saying the same pithy or
insulting thing. Hey, this is America.
</P>
<P>
   To prove my point that we enjoy freedoms that the Chinese can
only dream about, I provide as a public service a complete list of
the voluminous Clinton scandals, courtesy of the US House. While
some for-profit publications such as the Wall Street Journal and
the Rev. Jerry Falwell's church bulletin have attempted this task,
we owe it to the lower chamber of Congress for an up-to-date list
of the 55 congressional committee investigations into what Clinton
and his crew have been up to.
</P>
<P>
   I wrote Friday about how Speaker Gingrich's ledership team has
spent $17 million on just the 55 House committee investigations the
Democrats yowl about. When you throw in the various special counsel
probes like the $40 million-plus effort of Kenneth Starr ($1
million a month), the Senate forays into the get-Clinton business,
and other federal man-hours spent tracking down various scandals,
the taxpayer tab will probably exceed $100 million before Clinton
departs for the history books.
</P>
<P>
   But what are we getting for our money? Here's a smattering from
the GOP menu: Going alphabetically, with the Agriculture Committee,
we have the House Republican investigation of Hillary Clinton's
commodity transactions. That was closed with no action taken, after
spending a measly $105,000 to investigate how she made less than
that on her trading.
</P>
<P>
   Moving on to Appropriations, we have the ongoing probe of
Democratic contributors getting to snooze in the Lincoln Bedroom. B
means Banking, and that's the biggie: Whitewater. At least, it was
the biggie, until Monicagate erupted. The Banking Committee is also
in charge of seeing if Clinton laundered drug money and smuggled
narcotics at the Mena, Ark., airport when he was not playing the
saxophone, chasing girls or otherwise being governor.
</P>
<P>
   We have more committees investigating whether contributors got
contracts for giving campaign cash, but it is only Democratic
contributors who get investigated, even though Republicans raise
more money by a wide margin. The House is investigating unions, and
how promotions are granted in government jobs, how some FBI files
got into the hands of a political hack on the White House payroll,
and whether people such as former Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary,
or Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt, engaged in hanky-panky in the
course of their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Not even the Grim Reaper can put an end to some Republican
prying. The late Ron Brown's tenure as Commerce secretary was
exhumed, like the remains of the late US Ambassador Larry Lawrence,
whose corpse figured prominently in GOP outrage over the alleged
selling of burial plots in veterans' cemeteries. That investigation
was shut down quickly, however, when it turned out that a prominent
Republican congressional committee staff chief had wangled a crypt
for a nonveteran.
</P>
<P>
   We will be hearing much this week of the Clinton crew's
solicitation of campaign money from Chinese-Americans with
connections to the Beijing regime and military machine. Some in the
GOP leadership have denounced Clinton for selling out America's
national security for a mess of campaign contribution pottage.
</P>
<P>
   These tend to be the same people who complain about labor
unions, immigrants, makeup of trade missions, the law enforcement
performance in Waco in the Branch Davidian disaster, IRS audits of
right-wing groups, and whether Al Gore used a White House phone to
schmooze big contributors.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats are hot under the collar because some of the
information subpoenaed by the Republicans ends up leaked to the
news media, like the confidential phone logs of former Commerce
Department insider John Huang.
</P>
<P>
   Labor unions have had their files ransacked by GOP investigators
or government agents acting for same. The GOP was blocked from
subpoenaing the private personal files of 22,000 Hispanic students
at Rancho Santiago Community College in California when a defeated
congressman, Robert Dornan, tried to find out if any illegal aliens
voted against him.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic National Committee and various state committees
have been forced to photocopy hundreds of thousands of pages of
files and turn them over to probers, and the legal bills for the
Democrats have run well over $10 million, with no end in sight.
This Congress has done wonders for Xerox.
</P>
<P>
   It would all change if the Democrats took back control of the
House this fall, but the GOP has a 12-seat edge in the 435-seat
chamber, and despite some brave talk by the Democrats, I look for
more of the same next year, and the year after.
</P>
<P>
   For your own copy of the Democrats' 51-page catalogue of the
GOP's hydra-headed Investigation Machine, write to House Democratic
Leader Richrd Gephardt, chairman, US House Democratic Policy
Committee, H-204, US Capitol, Washington DC.

`NUNSENSE A-MEN!': GRAB BAG OF JOKES, WITH MEN AS NUNS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes at end of review.)  
(lb) 
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Leopards may not be able to change their spots, but
habits can change their nuns.
</P>
<P>
   So today's news is that the Little Sisters of Hoboken, those
cowled cutups and wimpled wiseacres who exemplified the spirit of
mischief on New York stages for nearly a decade in ``Nunsense,''
have returned. But only after a sex change.
</P>
<P>
   Really.
</P>
<P>
   The five sisters who opened the other day in a revival of the
show are men. The new version, written and directed once again by
Dan Goggin, goes by the title ``Nunsense A-Men!'' But it is still
very much the anything-for-a-laugh grab bag of jokes and songs
wrapped in a see-through plot that opened at the Cherry Lane
Theater in December 1985 and didn't give up the ghost until
February 1995 at the Douglas Fairbanks Theater after 3,672
performances.
</P>
<P>
   Is it a great show? No. Is it fun? Definitely yes, especially
for those who can bear with the gags, which run from the inane
(``How do you get down off a duck?'' ``How did you get up there in
the first place?'') to the profane (double-entendres about names
like John) to the punny (``Hello, Dalai Lama'') and the funny (a
raucous recipe for turkey stuffing using unpopped corn).
</P>
<P>
   The show gathers momentum as it proceeds, and by its conclusion
it manages to impress if not with its sophistication then with the
energy and talent of its cast and its relentless commitment to the
spirit of entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Does it make a difference that the nuns are played by men? Not
in the least. It's a one-joke joke, and after Sister Mary Amnesia
makes her entrance, looking 7 feet tall, and the other four sisters
quickly establish their characters, ``Nunsense A-Men!'' wisely
moves on to the funny business at hand, and the fine actors take
advantage of the show's many opportunities to display their
talents.
</P>
<P>
   The cast is a genuine blessing. It is led by David Titus as that
porky pixie Sister Mary Regina, the Reverend Mother and resident
mugger, with plenty of help. Lothair Eaton plays Sister Mary
Hubert, the ambitious deputy whose lack of humility led her to
dream of turning the Little Sisters of Hoboken into the Big Sisters
of Newark.
</P>
<P>
   Greg White is the sweet, silly Sister Mary Amnesia, who makes
her loss of memory memorable and turns out to be a blessing in
disguise. Doan Mackenzie is the innocent-looking novice Sister Mary
Leo, a not-so-secret balletomane. And Danny Vaccaro is Sister
Robert Anne, right out of Brooklyn and yearning for a leading role
in the sisters' fund-raising show.
</P>
<P>
   Thank goodness all these performers can act, sing, dance and put
over a joke, because as anyone familiar with ``Nunsense'' knows,
the airheaded plot revolves around the sisters' efforts to raise
money by putting on a show.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   It seems that the order's chef, Sister Julia, Child of God,
managed to send 52 of its sisters heavenward, chilled out by means
of a batch of vichyssoise tainted with botulism. Forty-eight were
buried before Sister Mary Regina blew the order's remaining money
on a VCR, so four are still literally on ice in the freezer while
the question of paying for their burial remains unresolved.
</P>
<P>
   So, under the musical direction of Leo P. Carusone, with songs
that range from the tender to the hand-clapping torrid, the show
goes on, with everything from ``The Dying Nun Ballet'' to a
ventriloquist act with a nun dummy to gags about ``The Wizard of
Oz,'' ``Show Boat'' and ``Sunset Boulevard.''
</P>
<P>
   Playing at the 47th Street Theater, between heaven and Hell's
Kitchen, ``Nunsense A-Men!'' may not please the rigidly reverent,
but those who stick around long enough will find a fair share of
earthly rewards.

SUPREME COURT DECISIONS FAVOR VICTIMS OF SEX HARASSMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN FREEDMAN  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In twin landmark rulings, the Supreme Court made it
significantly harder Friday for employers to defend themselves
against sexual harassment charges by claiming they were unaware of
what lower-level supervisors were doing.
</P>
<P>
   In both 7-2 decisions, the court said employers in most cases
cannot use this defense because the federal civil rights law that
bars sex discrimination or harassment equates employers with their
``agents,'' or supervisors.
</P>
<P>
   So if a supervisor engages in harassment, the company could be
subject to ``vicarious liability'' even if its top officials were
ignorant of the supervisor's actions, the court said, wrapping up
its 1997-1998 term.
</P>
<P>
   In the decisions, which made it easier for workers to sue
employers for harassment, the court for the first time promulgated
standards governing the kinds of defenses, if any, the employers
may use.
</P>
<P>
   Women's rights advocates hailed the rulings.
</P>
<P>
   Marcia Greenberger, co-president of the Washington-based
National Women's Law Center, an advocacy and litigating group,
said, ``I think these cases provide an important win for women. The
court's new rules provide powerful tools for those complaining
about sexual harassment in the workplace, but at the same time they
provide powerful incentives for employers to eliminate sexual
harassment before it takes place.''
</P>
<P>
   Judith Lichtman, president of the National Partnership for Women
and Families, an advocacy group, said that ``by insisting that the
buck stops with the employer, the court's decisions will help make
sure that sexual harassment is really taken seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   William Kilberg, representing the National Association of
Manufacturers and the Manufacturers Alliance, said: ``Employers
ought to be happy with the decisions because they reject the notion
that the employer is automatically liable. Nonetheless, the court
(put) a very heavy burden on employers to show that they have an
effective complaint policy in place.''
</P>
<P>
   But Lawrence Lorber, a Washington lawyer who represents
employers in sexual harassment cases, said, ``On balance, these
decisions were about as pro-employee as you could get out of any
court.''
</P>
<P>
   Lorber said he had advised employers that ``if they didn't train
managers in addressing sexual harassment, `you're in big trouble.'
And now I'd tell them, `You're in deadly trouble.'''
</P>
<P>
   The main winners, he added, are consulting firms that run
seminars on sexual harassment for employers. ``For those people,
this has to be Christmas in 99-degree June.''
</P>
<P>
   In the cases Friday, the justices also made it more difficult
for firms to claim they are not liable in cases where bosses tell
employees to have sex with them ``or else'' even if the threats
were not carried out and if the victims' careers did not suffer.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a person with supervisory authority discriminates in
terms and conditions of subordinates' employment, his actions
necessarily draw upon his superior position over people who report
to him,'' Justice David Souter wrote. ``An employee generally
cannot check a supervisor's abusive conduct the same way that she
might deal with abuse from a co-worker.''
</P>
<P>
   Souter's opinion dealt with charges by Beth Ann Faragher that
when she worked as a lifeguard in Boca Raton, Fla., between 1985
and 1990, supervisors constantly made lewd remarks to her and
engaged in ``uninvited and offensive touching.'' One supervisor
told her ``date me or clean the toilets for a year.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. District Court in Miami ruled that Faragher's
supervisors had harassed her, but an appeals court reversed the
ruling, saying the city of Boca Raton was not liable.
</P>
<P>
   In overturning that decision, the Supreme Court said the city
had failed to rebut the allegations of its liability. Thus,
apparently all that remains to be determined in the case is how
much money Faragher, now a public defender in Denver, can collect
from Boca Raton.
</P>
<P>
   The other case involved a Chicago saleswoman, Kimberly Ellerth,
who quit her job with Burlington Industries Inc. in 1994 after 15
months. Ellerth, now a homemaker in Belvidere, Ill., said she quit
because a supervisor, Theodore Slowik, had touched her
inappropriately, told offensive jokes, advised her to ``loosen up''
and warned, ``You know, Kim, I could make your life very hard or
very easy at Burlington.''
</P>
<P>
   But he never carried through on the threat, and Ellerth in fact
earned a promotion before quitting.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Anthony Kennedy, writing for the high court, said it
didn't matter whether the supervisor delivered on the threat.
</P>
<P>
   At a minimum he created a hostile work environment and Ellerth
should have the right to go to court and prove it, Kennedy wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Both cases marked a major effort by the court to refine sexual
harassment law. In 1986 the justices said such harassment was a
violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which bars
discrimination based on race, ethnic origin, gender or religion.
</P>
<P>
   But the court had set few rules for determining exactly when an
employer is liable for conduct by a supervisor that creates a
hostile working environment. In the 1986 case, all the court said
was that an employer is not ``automatically'' liable even when a
supervisor's harassment creates that environment.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the court issued new guidelines to clarify where an
employer's responsibilities begin and end.
</P>
<P>
   First, it said, employers always are subject to liability for a
hostile environment created by a supervisor over subordinates.
</P>
<P>
   In cases where an employee is not fired or demoted for failing
to submit to the supervisor's advances, employers have two lines of
defense, the court said.
</P>
<P>
   They can show they took steps to prevent sexual harassment or
corrected any improper behavior. Also, they can argue that the
employee charging sexual harassment did nothing to take advantage
of any ``preventive or corrective'' aspects of employer policies
against such harassment.
</P>
<P>
   But the court said no such defense is available when harassment
culminates in firing, demoting or undesirably reassigning the
employee. In such cases, the employer's only recourse is to try to
prove that there was no harassment.
</P>
<P>
   Joining Kennedy and Souter in the opinions were Chief Justice
William Rehnquist and Justices John Paul Stevens, Sandra Day
O'Connor, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer.
</P>
<P>
   Justices Clarence Thomas and Antonin Scalia, the court's most
conservative members, joined in a dissent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court today manufactures a rule that employers are
vicariously liable'' for sexual harassment by supervisors, Thomas
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Thomas said, ``an employer should be liable if, and
only if, the plaintiff proves that the employer was negligent in
permitting the supervisor's conduct to occur.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas himself was the focus of explosive sexual harassment
charges by a former subordinate, Anita Hill, during his Supreme
Court confirmation hearing in 1991. He denied Hill's charges and
won confirmation, but the brouhaha catapulted workplace sexual
harassment into the mainstream of American politics.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's rulings followed the court's 5-4 decision Monday making
it much harder for students who are sexually harassed by teachers
to hold school districts financially responsible. That decision was
based on a separate federal law dealing with discrimination in
education programs.
</P>
<P>
   The high court's decision in the Burlington case conceivably
could aid Paula Jones' effort to revive her sexual-harassment
lawsuit against President Clinton, one of her lawyers said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court's decision affirms ... that regardless of tangible
job detriment, sexual harassment in the form of unwelcome advances
and either threats or promises of employment action is sufficient
for women to receive remedies in a court of law,'' said Jones'
co-counsel, John Whitehead, president of the Rutherford Institute,
which is paying her legal expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Jones accused Clinton of propositioning her when he was Arkansas
governor and she was a state employee. A federal judge threw out
the lawsuit and said employees can collect damages only if their
refusal to submit to sexual demands results in on-the-job
retaliation. The judge said Jones had not shown any adverse
job-related consequences.

   Potent thunderstorms will erupt over the upper Middle West on
Saturday as a cool front associated with a sluggish low pressure
system in western Canada wedges under and lifts humid air pouring
north from the Gulf of Mexico. Storms will ignite across western
Minnesota and eastern South Dakota and then forge eastward across
the Great Lakes region. A few storms will reach severe levels, with
hail, damaging winds and tornadoes possible.
</P>
<P>
   A cluster of thunderstorms will flare up Saturday night across
the central Plains as a wedge of warm air aloft, which inhibited
storm development during the day, is eroded by cooler air
associated with a jet stream disturbance arriving from the Rockies.
Heavy rain is possible, with the main threat directed at Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   To the south, downpours will batter parts of the upper Texas and
Louisiana seaboards as a tropical low pressure area works in tandem
with air teeming with moisture.
</P>
<P>
   Heavy showers and thunderstorms are possible later Saturday and
Saturday night from lower Michigan across parts of Ohio, West
Virginia and southwestern Pennsylvania as a stalling front teams
with jet stream disturbances and a flow of very humid air from the
southwest.
</P>
<P>
   Humidity will gradually lower in the Northeast on Saturday and
Saturday night as dry air filters south behind a weak cool front.
Hit-or-miss showers and thunderstorms will escort the front
southward across the region. Meanwhile, isolated heavy storms will
boil up over parts of North Carolina as cooler air aloft arrives
over hot, humid surface air. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Focus: For Good Measure
</P>
<P>
   Great care is taken to insure accurate temperature measurements.
Official thermometers are mounted in white enclosures so that
sunlight does not fall on them and warm them. Because air does not
readily absorb sunlight, a thermometer exposed to sunlight would
register too high a reading for the actual air temperature.
Similarly, thermometers are located five feet above the ground and
away from buildings so that infrared radiation from these objects
is not readily absorbed by instruments. Thus, home and bank
thermometers often read too high for the actual air temperature.

and bend over backwards to help our sons and daughters buy a
farm.'' The problem for Eli's grandfather _ who does not want to be
identified further because of church strictures _ and the 36,000
other Plain Sect disciples in picturesque Lancaster County is that

William Penn welcomed their persecuted forebears nearly three

   KOSOVO (Pristina, Serbia) _ Belgrade has ordered its military

recapture pockets held by ethnic Albanian rebels and reopen roads
the separatist rebels have blocked for weeks, Western diplomats and
military officials said on Friday. The escalation of the fight

   NIRELAND-ELECT (Belfast, Northern Ireland) _ Parties committed

victory. The results showed that the province's two biggest
parties, the Ulster Unionist Party of David Trimble and the Social
Democratic and Labor Party of John Hume, would get the chance to
fulfill their historic pledge to work together to end the sectarian
conflict. But the ongoing count of the ballots from Thursday's

of companies that have effective anti-harassment policies in place.
The two 7-to-2 decisions cut through a thicket of confusing and

   NY-LANDLORD (New York) _ Over the last 20 years the families at
Bedford Gardens, a sprawling Brooklyn apartment complex, have grown
accustomed to encountering the name Kraus at every turn. At the
center of an empire of companies bearing his name is Herman Kraus,
a tall, methodical, 70-year-old lawyer. Year after year, through
legal maneuvering and sheer tenacity, he has managed to award his
own companies almost every major contract to operate and maintain
the 639-apartment complex, which gets more than $3 million a year
from the federal government in rent assistance for its
working-class tenants. The unusual arrangement has made the complex
into what city officials have described as the closest thing to a
monopoly in the city's assisted housing system. By Randy Kennedy.

make Western tongues trip, there is a growing apprehension that
they and other Japanese financial institutions may threaten the
long boom on Wall Street and even the stability of the global
economy. There is increasing agreement in world financial capitals
that Japan's recessionary problems center on a problem the
government is only beginning to confront: the mountain of bad debts
at the nation's banks. By Sheryl WuDunn and Nicholas D. Kristof.

COURT HEARS ARGUMENTS ON EXECUTIVE PRIVILEGE FOR SECRET SERVICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By STEPHEN LABATON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A federal appeals court Friday greeted with
considerable skepticism the Clinton administration's claim that
Secret Service agents should not have to testify in the Lewinsky
matter.
</P>
<P>
   At a hearing before the three-judge panel, Justice Department
lawyer Stephen Preston came under a barrage of difficult questions
about who could invoke the novel privilege created by the
administration, how long such a privilege might last, whether the
administration could use it to limit the testimony of retired
agents, and how broadly it could be applied.
</P>
<P>
   One of the judges, Douglas Ginsburg, referred to the contours of
the proposed privilege as ``odd'' and ``bizarre.'' Another member
of the panel, Stephen Williams, said it was ``unique'' for the
administration to seek a privilege for protecting the president
that the president himself does not invoke.
</P>
<P>
   The third judge, A. Raymond Randolph, questioned how the
government could continue to exert authority to limit the testimony
of retired agents. He also suggested that the proposed privilege
conflicts with a federal law that requires all federal employees to
report evidence of crimes to the attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   The judges' questions strongly suggested that Kenneth Starr, the
independent counsel investigating the nature of the president's
relationship with the former White House intern Monica Lewinsky,
would prevail, at least at the appeals court level, in defeating
the claim by the Secret Service that confidentiality is essential
to protecting the president.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's investigators have sought to question Secret Service
officers and an agency lawyer about President Clinton and others in
the White House as part of the inquiry into whether anyone lied or
obstructed justice in the Lewinsky inquiry.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The tone of Friday's hearing was the first welcome sign for
Starr this week. Thursday, he suffered two setbacks. Over the
objections of prosecutors, a federal judge in Arkansas ordered the
release of Susan H. McDougal, a former business partner of Bill and
Hillary Rodham Clinton, shortening her prison term by eight months.
</P>
<P>
   Also Thursday the Supreme Court ruled that Starr was not
entitled to the notes of a lawyer representing the former White
House aide Vincent Foster because they were protected by the
lawyer-client privilege. Foster committed suicide five years ago,
and the Supreme Court held that the lawyer-client privilege
survived the death of the client.
</P>
<P>
   In the Secret Service case Friday, Starr made reference to the
court's decision, during a series of questions about whether former
agents under the administration's privilege theory could testify
about former or dead presidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We learned yesterday that people have a keen interest in their
posthumous reputation,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A number of us,'' Starr replied, ``learned that in a very keen
and acute way.''
</P>
<P>
   The sixth floor of the federal courthouse Friday was like a
kaleidoscope of Clinton scandal and investigation. Down the hall
from the appeals court hearing, a federal district judge was
considering motions by Webster Hubbell and his wife, Suzanna, to
throw out a tax case on the grounds that Starr had no authority to
bring such a case. The courtroom was crammed with defense lawyers
representing other targets of other independent counsels examining
the Clinton administration. And James Robertson, the federal
district judge hearing the oral arguments, was also supervising a
jury that Friday began deliberations in a case brought against two
defendants by the independent counsel investigating former
Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy.

CHEERING ROY GOODMAN, FOR THE SAKE OF THE ARTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By RALPH BLUMENTHAL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Calling himself ``a most cogent argument for term
limits,'' Roy Goodman celebrated his 30th anniversary in the state
Senate at a fund-raising dinner on Thursday night that drew many
arts figures sustained over the years by grants he has delivered
from Albany.
</P>
<P>
   Among his toasters and roasters at the Waldorf-Astoria hotel was
his fellow Republican Gov. George Pataki who recently vetoed some
of the arts appropriations that Goodman tried to add to the latest
state budget. But the governor called the arts ``one of the things
that has made this city different'' and praised Goodman for his
advocacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If our party screws this up in Washington, Roy Goodman is
going to make sure we get it right in Albany,'' Pataki said.
</P>
<P>
   Goodman, 68, announced in March that he was seeking state arts
grants of slightly over $52 million, but the total has since been
cut to below $42 million.
</P>
<P>
   Still in the kind of maneuvering Goodman is known for, he has
rounded up an additional $7 million in capital grants for Carnegie
Hall, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Intrepid Sea-Air-Space
Museum, the radio station WNYC and the new 42nd Street, among other
cultural institutions, as so-called member initiatives written into
bills. About $1 million more in operating grants to other groups is
pending.
</P>
<P>
   The dinner, attended by 360 guests, raised about $300,000 for
Goodman's 16th Senate race this fall, for a rematch against his
last Democratic challenger, Robert Bellinson, a lawyer whom Goodman
beat, with 62 percent to 36 percent of the vote in their 26th
District on the East Side of Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The independently wealthy Goodman, whose immigrant father
developed pharmaceuticals, including Ex-Lax, has raised a campaign
war chest of $1 million that he said may also underwrite a bid for
higher office.
</P>
<P>
   He declined to be more specific but he ruled out another
campaign for mayor. He ran and lost to Edward Koch and other
challengers in 1977. He began his career in government and politics
as Mayor John Lindsay's first director of finance and city
treasurer in 1966.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians of all stripes, including Democrats like former
Mayor Abraham Beame and Rep. Charles Rangel, chairman of the House
Ways and Means Committee, were on hand for the bipartisan salute
that often took on a lampoonish edge, depending on the speaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have been remarkable,'' said Kurt Vonnegut, the writer,
adding, ``and may I say, un-Republican.''
</P>
<P>
   President George Bush, who served as co-chairman of the event
but could not attend, because of a scheduling conflict, sent a
``Dear Roy'' letter with thanks for all the jokes passed along over
the years. ``Keep them coming,'' Bush wrote. ``But, Roy, don't give
up your day job.''
</P>
<P>
   Pataki, noting that he had entered office backing term limits
for politicians, said: ``Tonight we're celebrating failure. Who
needs term limits?''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, starting with his well-worn
Mafia-godfather imitation, praised Goodman's legislative efforts to
investigate mob control of the carting industry.
</P>
<P>
   City Councilman Andrew Eristoff, who said that Goodman has been
his state senator for just about his whole life, urged him to keep
spinning his tales, ``even if your polysyllabic but wise
loquaciousness has us mystified.''
</P>
<P>
   Celeste Holm, the actress, and Roberta Peters, the soprano, also
spoke. Goodman's daughter Claire Goodman Cloud, a singer,
entertained with her band. Tony Randall, rushing off stage after
``The Sunshine Boys,'' made it in time to hail Goodman. If anyone
was surprised he was there, the septuagenarian Randall said, ``I'm
surprised I'm here.''
</P>
<P>
   Cindy Adams, the gossip columnist, wouldn't say that Goodman has
been around a long time but, she said, ``if you look at an
enlargement of `The Last Supper,' he's third from the right.''

 &HT;    Mac's moonshots over Miami may set homer mark

 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   I've done the math. Regardless of the chaos that may ensue, it
is my duty to inform you that it really could happen.
</P>
<P>
   No, not a direct hit from a barn-sized meteor. This is bigger
than that. This is so enormous, it could actually make the Florida
Marlins matter once more.
</P>
<P>
   Picture this. Or better, listen to the distant, rumbling
possibility.
</P>
<P>
   It is the end of August in Miami, with September waiting at the
gate. The Marlins are 35 games out of first place in the NL East.
The field at Pro Player Stadium is looking a little tired. By this
time, you see, the Dolphins will have played a couple of exhibition
games there, chalking up the baseball diamond with lines of
football authority and scoring it with signs of the temporary
bleachers being rolled back and forth across left field.
</P>
<P>
   To fill the stadium under ordinary conditions would take
something more than a cap giveaway.
</P>
<P>
   What we're talking here, though, is almost beyond the
imagination. We're talking Mark McGwire, baseball's answer to King
Kong, marching into Pro Player Stadium ahead of an army of
satellite TV trucks and a squadron of news helicopters with the
unstated but undeniable goal of erasing Roger Maris' asterisk once
and for all.
</P>
<P>
   With the slightest adjustment to McGwire's current pace, turning
it up just a quarter of a notch, baseball's most majestic
single-season record could be tied and possibly even toasted at Pro
Player Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Follow the logic, but please don't read it aloud. Big Mac
doesn't like to hear this stuff and we don't want to upset him, not
at this delicate moment in the hyping process.
</P>
<P>
   The man has 35 homers already. That's an average of one goner
for every 2.2 games St. Louis has played this season. Now you could
factor in that McGwire has missed four games because of injury and
two more because Tony La Russa wanted to give him a rest. That
changes the ratio to one homer for every two games that Big Mac has
played, an unrealistic standard given the fact he's sure to miss a
few more.
</P>
<P>
   Let's agree, then, on 2.2 games for every McGwire homer, on the
average. Starting today, he'd need just less than 61 games to tie
Maris' record of 61 homers. To break it, he'd need 63 games.
Drumroll, please.
</P>
<P>
   The formula for the first landmark has McGwire tying Maris'
record at Pro Player Stadium on Sept.1, the middle of a three-game
series with the Marlins. And if he picks up the pace just a bit,
the second, grander landmark could come here, too.
</P>
<P>
   OK, I hear you out there. Foolish conjecture, you're saying. The
ultimate example of overbearing statistical manipulation.
</P>
<P>
   Guilty and guilty. McGwire might not break the record, or if it
is broken, somebody else might do it. Have you checked Sammy Sosa
or Ken Griffey Jr., lately?
</P>
<P>
   All the same, it's a kick to contemplate. Remember McGwire's
first visit to Miami last August? An upper-deck moonshot, and then
another. Two upper-deckers in one game. Only Game 7 of the 1997
World Series produced more spectacular footage at Pro Player.
</P>
<P>
   Personally, I'm pulling for it big-time. Nothing could be more
fitting of baseball's modern legacy than McGwire making history
here. Then we'd have Hank Aaron breaking the career home run record
in a ballpark that no longer exists and Big Mac breaking the season
record in a ballpark nobody wants.

 &HT;    Guidry takes time to help a Cajun
 &HT;    By Dan Graziano
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Joe Fontenot was a year old in 1978, when Ron Guidry was a New
York Yankees hero, pitching hundreds of miles away from Fontenot's
Louisiana hometown of Lafayette. Fontenot was too young to really
notice.
</P>
<P>
   He was 18 in 1995 when he was drafted by the San Francisco
Giants and went off to play professional baseball. By then, he was
aware of the significance of Guidry, the slightly built Cajun
left-hander living 15 minutes from Lafayette.
</P>
<P>
   Guidry's nephew, Brooks Badeaux, was a teammate of Fontenot's at
Acadiana High School, just outside of Lafayette. So when Fontenot's
parents called Guidry and asked if he'd talk with their son about
life in pro baseball, Guidry was happy to help.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to his house,'' said Fontenot, now a Marlins starter
who will pitch tonight against the Red Sox. ``What a great guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess he said a lot of things just trying to prepare me for
some of the things I'll probably be facing, and just to encourage
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Guidry enjoys it. He just took a job as a pitching coach with an
independent minor-league team in Lafayette, called the Bayou
Bullfrogs. He teaches young players how to pitch and how to
prepare.
</P>
<P>
   But since the Texas-Louisiana League isn't exactly churning out
big-leaguers, Guidry also works with prospects such as Fontenot and
Phillies rookie Carlton Loewer, who's also from that area.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joey is from Cajun country,'' Guidry said. ``He is the next
Cajun.''
</P>
<P>
   Approached with this information, Fontenot shakes his head. He's
got the roots, he admits, and the surname. But he doesn't have the
accent. Not in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I get away from the Cajun accent, I lose it,'' Fontenot
said. ``But all you've got to do is go back to your parents' house,
or your friends' house or your grandparents' house, and it comes
right back.''
</P>
<P>
   Guidry, whose accent is thick and whose roots are thickly
embedded in the soft Louisiana soil, takes pride in being a Cajun,
and wouldn't bestow such a tag on someone of whom he didn't think
highly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joey is a good one,'' Guidry said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime we have a pitcher from this area, I watch him pretty
close, and he's got what it takes to be a good one. I'm glad he's
up (in the majors), because that's the best way to learn fast.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the advice he gave him, Guidry remembered one part
clearly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him, your privacy is the first thing you lose,'' Guidry
said. ``So you have to respect your own privacy, because no one
else will. It's something you have to give up if you want to be a
big-leaguer.''
</P>
<P>
   When he remembers his pre-professional encounter with a
Louisiana (and New York) legend, Fontenot is thankful for the time
Guidry took.
</P>
<P>
   And he's still a little awe-struck.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember seeing him pitching on TV, but I was so young,''
Fontenot said.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things he did tell me was, when you go into a game,
you don't necessarily have to have your 95 mph fastball right away,
that you can get by without your best stuff and still win
sometimes. But he had nasty stuff, man. I still remember watching
him on TV and hearing them talk about his slider. He was awesome.
Like a little Randy Johnson.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet, approachable and helpful as any coach he could have
talked to before heading off for his first year in the minors.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's like everybody's buddy,'' Fontenot said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My area's really not a big baseball area at all, and so I
don't think people there know how good he was. But he was great,
and I'm just glad to have gotten to know him.''

 &HT;    Panthers to lose a player today
 &HT;    By Brian Biggane
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. _ Florida has no first-round pick in the NHL
draft, but that doesn't mean the Panthers won't have a busy
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   General Manager Bryan Murray has been negotiating with Nashville
GM David Poile in an effort to land a top goaltending prospect this
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Florida also will lose one player in today's 2 p.m. expansion
draft. And while Murray hopes he's talked Poile into taking Johan
Garpenlov, Poile could select Dave Gagner or Kirk Muller, who were
also left unprotected.
</P>
<P>
   Poile can select up to five goaltenders, and Murray has talked
for months about trading for one that could team with Kevin Weekes
to make up Florida's goalie tandem of the future.
</P>
<P>
   After studying the talent available, however, Murray talked as
if he might have to settle with what he's got: Weekes and veteran
Kirk McLean.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boston got by last year with Byron Dafoe and Rob Tallas, and
other teams have had success without a big-name guy,'' he said
Thursday. ``We've got Kevin and Kirk, and they can play in the
league. Kevin hasn't proven he can win, but he's a good prospect.
Kirk is not in the upper echelon, but he's played a long time.
We're not desperate. If we can do something, fine. If we don't,
we'll survive.''
</P>
<P>
   While Bryan Murray still hadn't discussed the situation with new
coach Terry Murray, his brother, he has indicated the chances of
signing John Vanbiesbrouck, who can become an unrestricted free
agent Wednesday, are not good.
</P>
<P>
   Murray admitted he was ``disappointed'' that a couple of
last-minute trades shortened the list of goaltenders available. He
said he was interested in Steve Shields, who was traded from
Buffalo to San Jose and then protected by the Sharks.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there are others,'' he said. ``Kevin Hodson (of Detroit),
Jim Carey (Boston), Mike Dunham (New Jersey) and Jamie McLennan are
all guys who can play in the league, though most of them haven't
had the chance to be a number one.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryan Murray said his expectation that Poile will take Garpenlov
in today's draft, meanwhile, stemmed from conversations he's had
lately with Poile.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's asked a lot about him, and I've told him he's a good,
smart player who can score, but maybe didn't get enough opportunity
with us last year,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As it stands now, Florida's first pick would be the second pick
of the second round, or the 29th overall.

 &HT;    Reid Ryan to fans: Get on the bus
 &HT;    By Christian Davenport
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROUND ROCK, Texas _ Want to be one of the first to jump on the
Round Rock baseball team bandwagon?
</P>
<P>
   Reid Ryan, son of the legendary pitcher Nolan Ryan, is
organizing a bus trip to San Antonio so eager Central Texas
baseball fans can meet the minor league team he recently bought
with his father and Houston business partner Don Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   They plan to move the Jackson Generals, a Double-A affiliate of
the Houston Astros, to Round Rock for the 2000 baseball season.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Reid Ryan said that for $25, fans will get a ticket to
the July 16 game between the Generals and the San Antonio Missions,
a round-trip bus ride and all the hot dogs and hamburgers they can
eat. Fans will get a chance before the game to meet the team that
will eventually play in a yet-to-be built stadium on U.S. 79.
</P>
<P>
   Buses will leave the Round Rock Chamber of Commerce, located at
212 East Main St., at 3:30 p.m., July 16. For more information,
call the Chamber at 255-5805.
</P>
<P>
   Buses will also leave from a downtown Austin site that has not
yet been determined. For information on making the trip from
Austin, call 322-5621.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be a great Central Texas rivalry,'' Reid Ryan
said, referring to competition that he said will blossom between
San Antonio and Round Rock.
</P>
<P>
   Reid Ryan has said he also has plans to build a museum for Texas
baseball at the new stadium and a Texas League Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   But the next step, he said, is a name-the-team contest, which is
expected to take place the first week of July.

 &HT;    Check out your physician's credentials on the Web
 &HT;    By Mary Warejcka
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the first time, consumers worried about their doctors'
credentials will be able to check them on the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   By July 1, 1999, information about Florida doctors' training,
liability insurance, malpractice lawsuits concluded for more than
$5,000 and discipline is expected to be on one Internet site.
Still, patients shouldn't rely solely on that information, both a
physician and patient advocate warn _ albeit for different reasons.
</P>
<P>
   The profiles, which were approved by legislators in 1997, will
cover 56,000 medical doctors, osteopaths, chiropractors and
podiatrists. By next summer, the Florida Department of Health will
also have a plan to place background on the rest of the state's
more than 700,000 health workers on-line.
</P>
<P>
   About 200 board members and staff for the various medical
professions are meeting today in Palm Beach Gardens to discuss the
physician profile and other issues.
</P>
<P>
   People without computer access will be able to get the
information sent to them, said Pam Potter-Ricco, a health
department spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will be leaders in the country,'' said Ray McEachern,
president of the Association for Responsible Medicine, a
patient-advocate group with offices in Tampa and Palm Beach County.
</P>
<P>
   But he said one key piece of information will be missing _ a
list of lawsuits the doctor won. McEachern contends that a doctor
with three won lawsuits could still signal a problem.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Douglas Dedo, past-president of Palm Beach County's Medical
Society, said the number of suits does not always predict a bad
doctor. Patients need to rely more on what friends have to say and
their own experiences, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He also worries incorrect information will be published on the
Internet. When Massachusetts became the first state to start a
doctor profile program in 1996, some records were not complete.
</P>
<P>
   But Potter-Ricco said all information will be verified with both
the doctors and with health department records. That includes
ensuring that doctors haven't lied about lawsuits or discipline.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone caught lying can be disciplined, Potter-Ricco said. And
if doctors fail to turn in the profile, the health department can
fine them $50 a day.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the profile information is already available from the
department but takes at least several days to get. And the profile
will provide new training information, Potter-Ricco said. For
example, a person wanting a face lift can verify his doctor is
certified for the surgery.

 &HT;    Farmer-Patrick continues to chase vindication
 &HT;    By John Maher
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ Sandra Farmer-Patrick, an Olympic silver medalist in
1992, wasn't in New Orleans for the U.S. Track and Field
Championships. Technically, she could have been. Even though the
Wells Branch hurdler is still waiting to hear about an appeal to
USA Track and Field, which suspended her for a disputed positive
drug test two years ago, she believes she can now legally get her
career back on track.
</P>
<P>
   ``My time is up. The suspension is over,'' Farmer-Patrick said.
A pregnancy _ she and husband David are expecting a boy in late
July _ is what's currently keeping Farmer-Patrick out of
competition. She expects to start training again in the fall and
hopes to be vindicated by then.
</P>
<P>
   Problems began for Farmer-Patrick at the U.S. Olympic trials in
1996. Both she and Mary Slaney were tested and registered elevated
levels of testosterone to epitestosterone (T.E. ratio). Both
substances are found naturally in the body, but testosterone is
also used as a performance-enhancing steroid.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers and experts for both Slaney and Farmer-Patrick contended
that the test was flawed, that a positive 6-to-1 T.E. ratio can
also be caused by a lowered level of epitestosterone, which can be
caused by a variety of factors in females.
</P>
<P>
   Slaney was cleared for competition by USA Track and Field in
September. Farmer-Patrick, meanwhile, kept waiting and waiting and
waiting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sent all the relevant facts. They refused to accept those
facts. They refused to reverse anything, but we were still waiting
to hear from them. I can't believe it has taken this long,''
Farmer-Patrick said.
</P>
<P>
   The Jamaican-born Farmer-Patrick can't help but compare her case
to that of the popular Slaney.
</P>
<P>
   ``They suspended her after me and they exonerated her before
me,'' she said. ``I had a lot of faith in USA Track. I'm saddened
to think that the process is not fair for everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Farmer-Patrick said that she had a hearing with USA Track and
Field in February 1997 and that they reached a decision to suspend
her in May. Although the process is supposed to be confidential,
word soon got out. Farmer-Patrick missed the world championships in
June of last year and has not competed since.
</P>
<P>
   She said she furnished test results and other evidence as part
of the appeal process, but has heard nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess one of the holdups was the transcripts. They were
missing some information,'' Farmer-Patrick said.
</P>
<P>
   Atlhough she knew her two-year ban would be up this summer
anyway, she has not been training for competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Emotionally I was so drained,'' Farmer-Patrick said. ``I
didn't have the same fire and intensity. Sometimes I just get
really numb. They took a part of me away.''
</P>
<P>
   The 35-year-old Farmer-Patrick said it will take her about a
year to get in top competitive shape. Her main goal _ to compete in
the 2000 Olympics _ remains unchanged.

DEATHS OF 11 PEASANTS MAY NURTURE SEEDS OF REBELLION NEAR ACAPULCO

<TEXT>
<P>
   AHUACACHAHUE, Mexico _ Mauro Feliciano and Honorio Garcia were
simple men, dirt farmers who shared the grinding poverty of their
Indian neighbors in the forgotten mountains of southern Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The desire to better their world, say family and friends, led
Feliciano and Garcia to the nearby village of El Charco three weeks
ago to hear the ideas of a band of rebels. There, in a small
hilltop grammar school, Mexican army bullets took their lives along
with those of nine other people the government says were leftist
guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   The bloody deaths lay bare the seething frustration and anger
among Mexico's peasants, many of them Indian, that has propelled a
growing number to consider the guerrillas' gospel of violence, say
people in this Mixtec-speaking village where Feliciano, 49, and
Garcia, 32, lived.
</P>
<P>
   That willingness to listen has transformed this slumping corner
of Mexico into fertile soil for the Popular Revolutionary Army, or
EPR, a still vaguely defined leftist group that first appeared
nearly 100 miles from here two years ago Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Like past killings of peasants at the hands of government
forces, the deaths of the 11 people at the school in El Charco, 75
miles east of Acapulco in Guerrero state, may nurture the seeds of
rebellion already germinating in these mountains.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone has the idea of seeing whether this (rebellion) is an
alternative for the problems they find themselves in,'' says
Inocencio Silverio, a 30-year-old Roman Catholic priest and Mixtec
Indian for whom Garcia worked until recently as a catechist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is so desperate,'' he says. ``They want a solution,
whatever it might be. They are willing to listen to anything.''
</P>
<P>
   The EPR first appeared June 28, 1996, in the mountain hamlet of
Aguas Blancas, where exactly one year earlier state police gunned
down 17 unarmed farmers heading for an anti-government protest. The
guerrillas, carrying AK-47 assault rifles and dressed in new
uniforms, showed up at a ceremony commemorating the anniversary of
the massacre.
</P>
<P>
   Two months later, the rebels stunned Mexico by attacking the
Pacific coast resort of Huatulco and other towns across the
country's south, leaving scores dead. Soon after, government
security forces and secret police arrested suspected EPR members in
Guerrero, Oaxaca and other states.
</P>
<P>
   The EPR seemed to all but disappear. As Mexico's attention
returned to the insurgency of the Zapatista National Liberation
Army, which began in 1994 in southernmost Chiapas state, the newer
guerrilla group was largely forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   The June 7 shootings at El Charco brought the EPR back into
focus. Since the killings, EPR guerrillas and government forces
have clashed several times. Last Monday, three soldiers were killed
in what the government says was a guerrilla ambush in the mountains
north of the resort of Zihuatanejo.
</P>
<P>
   The Zapatistas, primarily Maya Indians, have always based their
insurrection on the call for greater rights for Mexico's indigenous
minority. In contrast, the EPR has espoused the leftist
revolutionary principles of movements that sprang up in the 1960s
throughout Latin America. The group's statements have condemned
Mexico's political system and economic policies, which have
produced stark income disparities.
</P>
<P>
   But almost from the start, much of the EPR's armed activity has
taken place in indigenous areas of Guerrero, Oaxaca and other
southern states, where Indians remain among the poorest of Mexico's
poor.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 11 people killed in the early morning hours of June 7 in
El Charco, 10 were Mixtec villagers from Ahuacachahue (pronounced
ah-wah-kah-CHA-way) and other nearby towns, and one was a student
at the National Autonomous University in Mexico City. All had spent
the night in the school after attending the guerrilla assembly
there the day before.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels leading the meeting belonged either to the EPR or to
a small offshoot that had broken away from the guerrilla group in
March. A communique printed in the Mexican press and attributed to
the rebels claimed the new group was formed because its leaders
were frustrated with the lack of action by the EPR command.
</P>
<P>
   What was discussed at the assembly remains unclear. Peasants who
were there insist that the rebels simply talked about how to better
organize communities to petition the government for fertilizer and
other aid. Government officials say the guerrillas were giving
tactical training to new recruits.
</P>
<P>
   Officials insist that all the people killed took part in a
firefight with government soldiers. But survivors and human rights
groups say that innocent people were killed and that some of the
dead may have been executed after surrendering.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost nobody was armed,'' says Odilon Romero, the 39-year-old
leftist mayor of Ayutla de los Libres, whose jurisdiction includes
the villages where the dead Indians lived. ``There are many strange
elements to all of this, a lot of things that don't make sense.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
`PEOPLE DIDN'T WANT THE VIOLENCE' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the days before the killings, word spread throughout the
Mixtec Indian towns near El Charco that the guerrillas wanted to
meet with villagers.
</P>
<P>
   There had been other such meetings since last summer, villagers
say, and each community had sent people. This time, Feliciano and
Garcia went for Ahuacachahue, a town of 4,000 about 10 miles across
the mountains from El Charco.
</P>
<P>
   Both men were serious sorts, those who knew them say. They
talked frequently about finding ways to lift their families _ and
their community _ out of the poverty that engulfed them.
</P>
<P>
   Feliciano was identified by the government as Mauro Morales, a
name, family members say, he also used. A father of 12, he had
taken part in local political and social organizations before being
elected ``comisario,'' the village's top official, late last year.
</P>
<P>
   Short and dark with solemn demeanor and intense eyes, Feliciano
fed his family by growing corn, beans, vegetables and fruit on
about 10 acres.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia _ Feliciano's brother-in-law and the father of five
children under the age of 11 _ was a religious man who had served
as a catechist, or lay leader, in the local Catholic parish. He
farmed his own small parcel of land.

HATCH VOWS MORE CONGRESSIONAL HEARINGS ON MICROSOFT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee
Friday vowed to open a new set of hearings into whether Microsoft
is poised to dominate the rapidly growing world of electronic
commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, issued a report criticizing Microsoft
for allegedly misleading his committee about a variety of the
company's practices, and he complained that the company has tried
to use public relations to distract the public from its conduct.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch, who has been a persistent critic of the software giant,
said he would open his hearings after the Senate returns from its
July 4 recess. The hearings are unlikely to lead to any change in
law, but would provide a forum for Microsoft's critics to air their
grievances.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe this is one of the more important policy issues of
our day, one which will have far-reaching ramifications for years
to come, and that it would be remiss for lawmakers and law
enforcers not to be paying close attention to this issue,'' Hatch
said in a speech on the Senate floor.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch said the hearings will focus on Microsoft's BackOffice
family of server products, which are designed to integrate various
computer functions for businesses. He said the hearings will also
focus on ``practices and developments affecting access to, and
transactions on, the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft spokesman Jim Cullinan said the company has not been
informed of any plan to hold hearings, but that ``Sen. Hatch's
comments were very unfortunate and inaccurate.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., blasted Hatch's ``lonely and
increasingly unsuccessful battle against Microsoft.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sen. Hatch and the Department of Justice are little interested
in the facts or merits of the case, but surely interested in
bringing the most successful software company in the nation to its
knees so that less successful, less competitive companies that do
not have the ability to succeed on their own can do so,'' Gorton
said.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch's comments came just a day after Microsoft formally
launched Windows 98, the latest version of the company's operating
system for personal computers. And earlier this week, Microsoft won
a significant victory against its critics when a federal appeals
court threw out an order requiring changes in Windows 95.
</P>
<P>
   But the company still faces a now-weakened but still significant
lawsuit challenging Windows 98. That case is set for trial in
September.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch Friday raised several new concerns about Microsoft's
conduct. In particular, the senator accused Microsoft of having
``seen fit to engage in a game of hide the ball,'' misleading his
committee and the public through a combination of misinformation
and a distracting public relations offensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft has, regrettably, seen fit to deploy a massive p.r.
campaign grounded in spin control and misdirection, as opposed to
engaging the American public on the basis of the facts and the
merits,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch said Microsoft misled the Judiciary Committee about its
licensing agreements with Internet service providers, about its
contracts with Internet content providers, and about several other
matters.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft denied misleading the committee, and said its spending
on public relations was necessary to counter similar actions of its
competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch also complained that Microsoft and its allies _ namely
Gorton _ have prevented the Justice Department from getting a
budget boost to pay for antitrust activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find it rather surprising that any one company would ...
have the hubris to ... seek to restrain a federal law enforcement
agency that has an obligation to enforce the laws,'' Hatch said.
</P>
<P>
   But Gorton said the antitrust division shouldn't get extra money
because ``these (legal) actions are a waste of the taxpayers' money
and represent the use of the taxpayers' money for the pursuit of
private antitrust remedies that, if they are appropriate at all,
should be financed by the competitors who seek them.''

AHUACACHAHUE, Mexico: parcel of land.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Although he could not read or write, Feliciano pushed education
on his children, scraping together money from his meager income to
help one of his sons work his way through college in Chilpancingo,
the Guerrero state capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since I was little, my father told me I had to study and
study. It was his dream,'' says Nicolas Feliciano, 21, the third
oldest of Mauro Feliciano's children and the first person in his
family ever to attend college. ``He was eating just tortillas and
salt in order to send me money for books.''
</P>
<P>
   After becoming an elected leader in January, Mauro Feliciano
spent months wheedling cement and other materials out of the city
government in Ayutla in order to build a Catholic church in his own
village.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia gave up his work with the church last month, Silverio
says, in order to help his brother-in-law with municipal matters.
</P>
<P>
   The priest says Garcia told him about his growing interest in
the guerrillas' message.
</P>
<P>
   Still, neither man was an active fighter, members of their
family insist. Like many of their neighbors, Feliciano and Garcia
were reluctant to pick up arms against the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``People didn't want the violence,'' Nicolas Feliciano says.
``They said the government was just waiting for us to do
something.'' &UR;

</P>
<P>
   The Mixtec farm villages that perch in the mountains down the
coast from Acapulco are as poor as any in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The rush in recent years to industrialize and join the global
economy has left behind millions of Mexicans, especially those in
the countryside. Nearly 75 percent of Mexico's Indians make their
living by farming.
</P>
<P>
   A surging population has meant less land to go around. The
eroding, thin soil has worn out in many places, making expensive
fertilizer and other farm products essential to raising crops. A
lack of good roads makes it difficult, if not impossible, to get
cash crops to market.
</P>
<P>
   ``We Indians are on the very bottom,'' says Silverio, who was
born near El Charco. ``Those in power don't know anything about us.
They come looking for votes and, then once they are elected,
quickly forget about us.''

   Since returning to the area three years ago after studying for
the priesthood, Silverio says he and other community leaders have
pushed for improvements, such as secondary schools, health clinics,
clean drinking water and electricity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people haven't received anything. None of our petitions
have been answered,'' the priest says. ``The first response of the
government is blood.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not that people are sympathetic with the (guerrilla)
movement,'' he says. ``It is just that no one else has offered any
other plan.'' &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; In the dry season, the roads that climb into the mountains
toward El Charco and Ahuacachahue are kidney-busting ribbons of
deep ruts and rocks. The torrential downpours of the tropical rainy
season, which is beginning now, mean the tracks will cease being
roads at all.
</P>
<P>
   With rain clouds now forming most afternoons, farmers stand in
the fields that hug the steep mountainsides, poking holes into the
soil to plant seeds.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacific Ocean shines like a broken mirror beyond the ridges
that roll away to the south. Other mountains embrace the horizon to
the west and north.
</P>
<P>
   Overripe mangoes litter the rocky soil in the orchards that
cover much of these mountains in a thick blanket of green. Poor
roads and a lack of marketing skills have kept the area's produce
from being sold in the cities.
</P>
<P>
   The scent of fallen fruit assaults the nostrils, a pungent
reminder of wasted promise.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
LEARNING BITTER LESSONS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   People from surrounding villages continue to trek to El Charco.
They come not to talk rebellion but to collect government handouts.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't much.
</P>
<P>
   Each family gets a few sheets of corrugated roofing, a kilo of
rice, another of beans, a can of tuna and some cooking oil.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is supposed to make them forget the shooting,'' says
Celestino Maximo, a Mixtec Indian schoolteacher helping distribute
the goods. ``The officials justify themselves by giving some
roofing, a bag of rice.''
</P>
<P>
   The state government has sent work crews to repair the school
complex where the killings occurred. Workers patch the
shrapnel-peppered roof, plaster over the hundreds of bullet holes
in the walls, and clean the dried blood from the floor and the
basketball courts where people died.
</P>
<P>
   The complex's three small buildings will never serve as the
village school again, teachers say. Local beliefs hold that the
bloodshed has created an evil environment that could sicken the
children. The 60 students now study in squat adobe buildings down
the hill from the school buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Their teachers say the complex, built barely a year ago, could
be used as a library. Or perhaps, they say, the buildings could
serve as a community center.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are going to organize more because of this,'' Maximo
says.
</P>
<P>
   Whether that organization will lead to more violence is
uncertain. But the lessons learned three weeks ago at the school
are bitter ones, teachers say. And they will be long remembered.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (officials) were accustomed that we indigenous peoples
would accept anything, that we would never lift our heads,'' says
Valentin Zavala, also a Mixtec teacher. ``And now if we do, they
try to repress us. Whenever someone rises up to defend the people,
they finish them off.''
</P>
<P>
   After his father was killed, Nicolas Feliciano quit college and
returned home to help with the farming. His father had planted five
acres of corn shortly before he died, and Nicolas says he'll help
bring in the crop. He hopes to resume his studies in a year, maybe
two.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a peasant,'' the articulate young man says on the back
patio of his family's two-room house in Ahuacachahue. ``I am
Indian. I speak Mixtec. I am not ashamed of that.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government considers us garbage, animals,'' he says.
``There is no respect for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Feliciano's voice tightens and his jaw clenches as he talks
about the killings of his father and uncle.
</P>
<P>
   But he won't look for trouble with the government, he says. With
a widowed mother and nine younger brothers and sisters, Feliciano
says, too many mouths depend on him for that. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; ``The government only did this so people would be afraid,'' he
says of the El Charco clash. ``I don't fear the government, (but) I
am going to control myself for my mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``But one day soon, the people are going to rise in arms,''
Feliciano predicts. ``People are completely tired of all this.''

 &HT;    TELEPHONE BILLS TO GO UP IN JULY
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;    For use the weekend of June 27-30 
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE 
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service(at) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Amid strenuous protests from lawmakers and consumer
groups, residential phone customers can expect a new charge to
appear on their monthly long-distance bills beginning July 1 to
help defray costs for hooking the nation's schools and libraries
into the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Households that use AT&AMP;T services will be charged a flat 93
cents, while Sprint plans to charge its customers a rate of 4.5
percent on long-distance calls. MCI, the other top long-distance
carrier, has not determined the rate, although spokeswoman Claire
Hassett estimated that MCI would be charging about the same level
as Sprint.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, the companies had quietly paid the fees, set by
the Federal Communications Commission as of last January, to its
new high technology subsidy fund for schools and libraries. But the
long-distance carriers' decision to pass those charges directly to
customers has stirred cries of ``taxation without representation''
from critics who say that the un-elected FCC is raising revenues.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., told a computer trade show
in Atlanta in early June that it is ``wrong for five un-elected,
appointed commissioners to establish a tax on every telephone line
in the United States.'' He predicted then that Congress would
``probably block it in the next two weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   However, on the eve of the new surcharge, Congress has yet to
act. The speaker ``still feels that this is unconstitutional,''
said spokesman Andrew Weinstein. ``There's a good chance that
action will be taken to address the issue in the near future.''
</P>
<P>
   Exactly what action is far from certain in the increasingly
politically complex dispute that affects nearly every household and
tens of thousands of schools in a program that would cost an
estimated $20 billion over the next 10 years. Since Vice President
Al Gore has been its most prominent cheerleader, the technology fee
has given Republicans an opening to dub it the ``Gore tax'' and
highlight the program's many early stumbles.
</P>
<P>
   At least one lawmaker, Rep. James F. Sensenbrenner, R-Wisc., has
introduced a bill to cancel the program altogether. But some
Republicans fear that would be seen as anti-education.
</P>
<P>
   ``Republicans have to be careful about the 'soccer moms,''' said
Ken Johnson, spokesman for Rep. Billy Tauzin, R-La., chairman of
the House telecommunications subcommittee. Tauzin is calling for
replacing the controversial fee with proceeds from a long-standing
3 percent telephone excise tax . Tauzin would cut that tax, first
enacted in 1914, by half and dedicate the proceeds to block grants
for states to buy technology for schools and libraries, but he has
yet to get a green light from Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Communications Commission has said that
long-distance carriers should not add the surcharge to customers'
bills. FCC Chairman William Kennard said recently that
``long-distance rates have never been lower,'' and added that the
``e-rate,'' as the technology subsidy fee is nicknamed by
supporters, should not cause telephone bills to increase.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the fee controversy, the program has had more than its
share of start-up problems:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  About 30,000 applications for subsidies of up to 90 percent
for the cost of telephone and Internet service have been waiting
for approval since last April. Although the new fund has already
collected $650 million, no funds have been distributed. A
spokeswoman for the Schools and Library Fund, a private corporation
that was set up to run the federal program, could not predict when
the money would begin flowing to qualified schools.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Some of the schools sent in the high technology equivalent of
a letter to Santa Claus, asing not only for the electronic hookup
but also a long list of advanced computer gear, as well as interior
redecorating, such as painting and new carpet, for rooms once they
have been wired.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The Schools and Library Fund has been found to have a shaky
legal foundation. The General Accounting Office, the investigative
arm of Congress, has released a report saying that the
Telecommunications Act of 1996, on which the fund is based, does
not authorize such a private organization.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The fund's chief executive officer, Ira Fishman, was given a
$200,000 annual salary, equal to President Clinton's. In response
to a flap, the FCC pared his pay to $150,000 as of July.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Expenses outpaced expectations and reached $7 million in the
first six months. Setting up the fund's Internet ``web site,'' for
example, cost more than half a million dollars, double the amount
planned.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC responded to critics on June 12 by reducing the total
fee level for the first year to $1.9 billion instead of the $2.25
billion originally set. It also ordered the Schools and Library
Fund to focus on subsidies for basic Internet and phone connections
for the neediest school districts. Kennard called the move a
``slowdown'' for the first year.
</P>
<P>
   That has satisfied no one in the debate. Supporters want the
money sent to schools faster, and critics continue to point to
mismanagement. Senate Commerce Chairman John McCain, R-Ariz., has
scheduled a hearing in mid July to examine whether some schools are
asking for ``gold-plated'' computer equipment.

GRAF EXPRESS STOPPED   SHORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ If one of the first Russians to play tennis, a
scribbler named Leo Tolstoy, had been at bleak, damp, chilly
Wimbledon Friday, he would have written a short story entitled
``The Eighteenth Time Never Fails'' with his countrywoman Natasha
Zvereva as the heroine.
</P>
<P>
   Tolstoy, a hacker with a court in the backyard, would describe
her trying decade of trying to avoid a beating by a superior (in
this case Steffi Graf) but getting stomped, anyway, 17 straight _
and then ... sweet deliverance, 6-4, 7-5.
</P>
<P>
   In Tolstoy's 1877 novel, ``Anna Karenina,'' the namesake throws
herself in front of a train. Natasha Zvereva has been prostrating
herself before the Graf Express since being run over and crowned
with a double bagel in a gory 1988 French Open final. But Friday
she not only crawled off the tracks in time but derailed the
locomotive, the comeback journey, and the hopes of 13,120
Grafanatics filling Centre Court.
</P>
<P>
   This was a lot to ask of a loosey-goosey 27-year-old from Minsk
in Belarus, who loves to boogie, go her own way, and makes most of
her money playing doubles, having won 20 majors. Her singles, good
enough for a No. 22 ranking, is often a so-who-cares proposition in
which not even Hulk Hogan or Atlas could hold up her concentration.
</P>
<P>
   However, anybody back home in Minsk would tell you, ``Nobody
beats our Natasha 18 straight times.''
</P>
<P>
   This wasn't the Natasha they know and love, though. Just as
Graf, working only her eighth gig in her current revival, third at
the Big W, ``wasn't myself ... tight ... nervous,'' neither was
Zvereva herself. Which she happily confessed after ``the best match
of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Her short pigtails shook as she laughed, ``I never concentrated
on every point before. Every point. Everybody in the locker room
asked me if I was sick. They gave me a lot of you-know-what
afterwards.
</P>
<P>
   ``At 4-all in the second, I started to think I could win.'' No
such thought had ever graced her wayward mind along the long, long
track that ran from Paris through such whistle stops as Key
Biscayne, Fla.; Montreal; Leipzig; Worcester, Mass.; Indian Wells,
Calif. ``I told myself to stop thinking immediately. Get it out of
my head. `Don't get distracted this time,' I said to myself.''
</P>
<P>
   In her life with Steffi Graf, Natasha impersonated the
Washington Generals while Graf was the Harlem Globetrotters. The
fall girl. Little Miss Zero. Graf was not uncharitable. Bones were
thrown: three of 37 sets were Natasha's to gnaw.
</P>
<P>
   Her Freedomless Trail began at Stade Roland Garros after
Zvereva, a 17-year-old Soviet, stunned the favorite, Martina
Navratilova, in the French semis. Ever in a hurry, Graf, at the
second stop of her Grand Slam travels of '88, was more emphatic
than usual, 6-0, 6-0. The most memorable passage of that 32-minute
crushing was the hour rain delay that divided it into two grim
acts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, sure, I remember that 6-0, 6-0. Pretty bad. I was too
young, too nervous,'' Zvereva said. ``But I don't remember the
rest. I don't say, `Well, No. 8 wasn't too bad,' or `No. 12 was
better.'''
</P>
<P>
   Few can do as much with a tennis ball as Natasha, who considers
herself ``a Russian'' even though she plays for Belarus. Her touch
is creative and imaginative with groundies and volleys. ``But ...
mindwise?'' she shrugged and smirked at herself.
</P>
<P>
   A free spirit _ ``I'd call myself a loner'' _ she doesn't
clutter her life with a coach or retinue, preferring to figure out
the game on her own. ``I just wanted to get the ball over the net,
get it on Steffi's backhand. That's the only plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Her low slice, topspin changeups, flawless reflex volleying, and
solid serving were sufficient to hang on to her own serve
throughout a close struggle. She pierced Graf just twice (opening
game, 11th game of the second). Uncharacteristically, Natasha hung
tough like Tolstoy's gallant Natasha of ``War and Peace.'' In the
tense closing game, she was firmness plus _ through the claque's
incessant ``Come on, Steffi!'' pleading, two deuces, a break point,
and a failed match point.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did it!'' she shrieked, kicking up her sneakered heels,
raising a fist, and trying to punch a hole in one of the
long-lingering, low-hanging charcoal clouds to celebrate Steffi's
sixth Wimbledon defeat in 74 matches. What better place to wreck a
hex? Centre Court, where Graf has triumphed seven times.
</P>
<P>
   As the Mother Freedom of Soviet tennis in 1989, Zvereva demanded
that her colleagues be permitted to keep all their prize money
rather than accept a meager stipend from the tennis ministry that
seized most of their cash. Natasha won that battle, though
pilloried in the press. Now she's liberated herself _ from Steffi
Graf.
</P>
<P>
   Can't you see the last line of Tolstoy's story? ``Natasha looked
her oppressor in the eye and was no longer Minsk meat.''

BAHRE GOING TO JUMP IRL? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUDON, N.H. _ New Hampshire International Speedway's Bob Bahre
was among the first track owners in the country to defect from
Championship Auto Racing Teams three years ago when he aligned his
1-mile oval with the breakaway Indy Racing League. But because of
sagging attendence figures and considerable financial losses from
staging IRL events, Bahre may be ready to part ways when his
three-year contract with the series expires after Sunday's New
England 200.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it would work out better, but it hasn't been any
better,'' Bahre said. ``CART's not been doing that bad; IRL's not
doing that bad, either. But neither of them are doing great. I just
think they've got to get together. This has not been good.''
</P>
<P>
   After failing to draw more than 55,000 combined in the four
years that CART races were held at NHIS from 1992-95, Bahre had
hoped the fledgling series founded by Indianapolis Motor Speedway
president Tony George would be the answer. But, he said, that has
not been the case. Attendance declined from 24,000 two years ago to
22,000 last year. ``We need to get at least 25,000 (fans) this year
to break even,'' said Bahre.
</P>
<P>
   Be it CART or IRL, that's something Bahre has not done for any
of the open-wheel, Indy car events at NHIS. This weekend, without
the financial cushion a title sponsor would provide, Bahre
estimates he stands to lose as much as $700,000.
</P>
<P>
   Although he has staged wildly successful NASCAR Winston Cup
events at NHIS before crowds that have grown progressively larger
each year, Bahre is not certain how much longer he can afford to
sustain heavy losses with IRL events. ``Loyalty means a lot to us,
but there comes a point,'' Bahre said. ``I'm not saying we will
(leave), but I think Tony would understand if we did.''
</P>
<P>
   Bahre's solution? A CART and IRL reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you took (IRL executive director) Leo Mehl and (CART owner)
Roger Penske and threw them together in a room and you took (CART
CEO) Andrew Craig and Tony George out, you'd have a deal done in
three hours,'' Bahre said. ``I'm convinced of that _ but that's
only my opinion now.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bahre said it was imperative to ``get rid of the egos'' in
order to reach an accord.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I told Andrew Craig that we were going with the IRL, he
said to me, `OK, well, then we're going to run right against
you,''' said Bahre, who noted that CART scheduled a race at Elkhart
Lake, Wis., that went head to head with his inaugural IRL race in
1996. ``The day he said that, he showed me what kind of man he was.
From that day on, I lost a lot of respect for the guy. There's a
lot of good people in CART, and a lot of good teams, but I have
absolutely no respect for Andrew Craig _ and that's only my
opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not likely, then, that Bahre would go back to CART. But if
the series were to return to NHIS, it could be viewed as a
considerable victory in its ongoing battle with the IRL for
open-wheel supremacy. Still, Bahre said that if Sunday marked the
last IRL event at NHIS, he would move forward with his two Winston
Cup dates.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if any discussions were planned with George, Bahre said,
``We haven't talked about it. The last time we talked was at
Daytona (in February). But we'll probably talk (this weekend). I
have no idea if they would stay or not. If they decided to pull
out, it would be up to Tony George.''

SULLIVAN PICKED BY PREDATORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Nashville Predators stocked their inaugural team
Friday in Buffalo during the National Hockey League expansion
draft, and one of their selections was veteran forward Mike
Sullivan, plucked from the Bruins' roster.
</P>
<P>
   Midway through the season, Bruins management went to Sullivan,
who was slated to become a Group 2 (restricted) free agent July 1,
and told him they wanted to sign him before the end of the year to
have enough players to meet the league requirement for exposure in
the expansion draft. At the time, the Bruins told Sullivan, who
made $550,000 last season, that he would likely be left
unprotected. Sullivan said he knew it was a possibility but felt it
was a fair contract and signed it.
</P>
<P>
   Now Sullivan will be packing up his family _ wife Kate and their
children, Kaitlin, Kiley, and Matthew _ and leaving the South Shore
for the Deep South.
</P>
<P>
   ``In all honesty, I have a mixed reaction,'' said Sullivan,
reached by phone during a golf match at Hatherly Country Club. ``In
one regard, I loved playing in Boston. There was the excitement of
playing on a rebuilding team. But the reality of the business is
that when something like this comes up, you have to take it in
stride. Now I'm part of the optimism of starting a new franchise.''
</P>
<P>
   The 30-year-old Sullivan, a native of Marshfield, Mass., was a
dependable cog in the Bruins' defensive wheel, and coach Pat Burns
often would utilize him to take key faceoffs in the defensive zone
late in the game or when the club was clinging to a one-goal lead.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan played 77 games and collected five goals, two of which
were game-winners, and 18 points. He had come to the Bruins just
over a year ago in a trade with the Calgary Flames.
President-general manager Harry Sinden said he believed that with
center Joe Thornton having a year under his belt and Jason Allison
having blossomed, the club could absorb the loss of Sullivan.
Veteran Tim Taylor, who is a Group 2 free agent but proved to be an
invaluable asset as the team's top defensive center, is expected to
be back next season. And if the Bruins elect to re-sign Group 2
free agent Ted Donato, he can also play center if need be.
</P>
<P>
   Sinden said the team projects to promote Randy Robitaille, Shawn
Bates, and Cameron Mann from AHL Providence, so management felt
that if Sullivan was taken, there also would be enough depth to
compensate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had five guys out there (that would be candidates for the
Predators),'' said Sinden Friday. ``I wouldn't want to put them in
order. We did our homework and figured it was going to happen. It's
not that we wanted to lose Mike. We didn't. We wanted to keep him
but we felt he was the most expendable. It sounds like Mike
Sullivan wasn't appreciated. He was. I think he can extend his
career down there.''
</P>
<P>
   It's possible that Nashville might not be the former Boston
University forward's last stop. During the expansion draft,
Predators GM David Poile said what you see is not necessarily what
you'll get, meaning there might be further roster tinkering.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a little bit of talk about movement but nothing
concrete,'' said Sullivan, who has been in close contact with his
agent, Bob Murray. ``My agent said he'd be in contact if anything
happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Sullivan will enjoy the summer in Scituate, Mass.
before heading to his new home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard,'' he said. ``When we came home, it was nice to play
in front of my family, and my wife lives 10 minutes from her
mother. There are a lot of things we're going to miss about playing
in Boston. It was a terrific year. I was glad to be part of this
franchise. But in talking to my agent the last couple of days, I
kind of had the sense this was going to happen, so you try to
prepare yourself for it. But then the reality hits and it causes a
bit of turmoil. But it'll be good for our kids to experience a
different part of the country.''

HANCOCK MUTUAL LIFE PLANS LARGE REAL ESTATE SALE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a surprise move to cash in all at once on the country's
booming property markets, John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co.
said Friday that it would sell off most of its real estate
portfolio this year.
</P>
<P>
   The step is the latest by an asset management company to unload
prime real estate holdings. Last month, the Prudential Insurance
Co. of America, the nation's largest insurer, further liquidated
its outsized property portfolio by selling its Embarcedero Center
in San Francisco to Boston Properties Inc. of Boston for $1.2
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin McGuire, head of Hancock's real estate investment group,
said Hancock would sell off around 150 of its 200 properties
starting this month. The sale will not include the company's Copley
Square, Boston headquarters, a glass skyscraper that is one of the
city's premier buildings.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us, this is just a good time to take some profits out of
some of the properties we're holding,'' McGuire said. When asked
whether Hancock had considered securitizing its property holdings
as a real estate investment trust, or REIT, McGuire said, ``This
strategy (selling) is better for us.
</P>
<P>
   A phalanx of top-notch trophy properties has come onto the
market in recent months, as property-holding companies seek to reap
gains from the strongest real estate prices in a decade. The Sears
Tower and Merchandise Mart, both in Chicago, and the Chrysler
Building in New York, were sold earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   But it is rare to see a company sell off most of its real estate
holdings in one fell swoop, as Hancock is doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our opinion, it's not the proper time to divest all your
properties at once,'' said Catherine Polleys, vice president and
strategic consulting director at Torto Wheaton Research, an
industry consulting firm, in Boston. ``It is quite surprising to us
that they're selling off all of their portfolio. There has to be
another strategic move behind this.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Hancock, which manages total assets of $116
billion, declined to state the book or market values of the
properties, which are spread out across major metropolitan areas
and include one of the Watergate office buildings in Washington,
DC. Hancock owns all of the properties outright.
</P>
<P>
   The company plans to use the proceeds to invest in its existing
businesses, which range from insurance products and mutual funds to
commercial mortgage and securitized lending operations. McGuire
declined to say whether the money would be used to finance
acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   Hancock, the nation's fifth largest mutual insurer, announced
earlier this month that it planned to convert into a publicly
traded company under an expensive and lengthy process known as
demutualization. The company has hired investment bank Morgan
Stanley &AMP; Co Inc. to dispose of its major office buildings.
</P>
<P>
   The John Hancock Center, a 100-story building that is one of
Chicago's most recognizable edifices, is already on the block.
Industry analysts say it could fetch $250 million and upwards.

A MATTER OF INTEGRITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By EILEEN McNAMARA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   We are masters of misguided sympathy.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts House Speaker Charles Flaherty pleads guilty to
tax evasion and liberals hesitate to demand his resignation.
(itals)He had such an admirable legislative record on behalf of the
poor.(unitals)
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Louise Woodward kills an 8 1/2-month-old baby and the public

</P>
<P>
   Now comes Patricia Smith, a columnist for this newspaper who
fabricated people, conversations, and scenes in columns that
appeared in this space on Monday and Friday over the last four
years.
</P>
<P>
   We cannot stop ourselves from bemoaning the ``tragedy'' that has
befallen her as if she were not the architect of her own demise. We
condemn the lies and praise the voice in the same breath, as if
they are not inextricably linked. In a piece criticizing her
fabrications, Dan Kennedy, media critic for the Boston Phoenix,
actually describes Patricia Smith as a journalist who ``spoke truth
to power.''
</P>
<P>
   The ombudsman for the Boston Globe reported dozens of phone
calls running in Smith's favor in the wake of her forced
resignation. Sadly, a lot of readers apparently think she didn't do
anything the rest of us don't do routinely.
</P>
<P>
   Compassion has its place _ no one wants to see another human
being self-destruct _ but what ever happened to righteous anger?
Why are we so afraid to condemn unequivocally the betrayal of a
public trust?
</P>
<P>
   The short answer is race, the single subject we are unable to
discuss without shifting in our seats and averting our eyes.
Harvard Law Professor Alan Dershowitz would have us believe that
Patricia Smith was the victim of a double standard. To the
contrary, she was the beneficiary of one. Her fall had nothing to
do with her race; her rise had everything to do with it.
</P>
<P>
   The dominant newspaper in a city with a troubled racial past was
so seduced by the power and lyricism of her words it forgot that we
publish a daily newspaper here on Morrissey Boulevard, not a poetry
anthology.
</P>
<P>
   An honorable commitment to open these pages to people long
unrepresented led to a less-than-honorable tradeoff. Patricia
Smith's images were so mesmerizing, her rage so galvanizing, that
we chose not to see the deceit at their core.
</P>
<P>
   It was the worst sort of racism that kept us from confronting
the fraud we long suspected. If we did ask, and she did tell, we
might lose her, and where would we be then? Where would we find an
(itals)honest(unitals) black columnist who wrote with such power
and grace? A white institution is paying now, just as much as a
black columnist, for its decision to trim, to cut corners, to roll
the dice.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Smith did not speak truth to power or to anyone else in
this space. On stage at the Cantab Lounge, she might give voice to
the voiceless. In this space, she gave voice to no one but herself.
</P>
<P>
   It might well be argued that there is more truth in the work of
Langston Hughes or Anne Sexton than in all the newspaper columns
laid end to end. But journalism makes no claim on ultimate truth.
We are charged only with holding up a mirror on the day's events.
That mirror either reflects the real lives of real people, or it is
no more than a funhouse distortion of this city and the ordinary
people at its heart.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those people open their lives to journalists and trust
us to tell their stories. Most of us privileged enough to do this
work are always amazed to hear the words, ``Come in and sit down.''
We are always humbled by the responsibility that trust engenders.
</P>
<P>
   Is there a double standard at The Boston Globe, Professor
Dershowitz? Sure there is. Mike Barnicle began work here as a
columnist at about the same time I began as a secretary. Isn't the
same double standard just as securely in place at the Harvard Law
School? Isn't that why Professor Derrick A. Bell Jr. refused to
teach his classes until the law school granted tenure to a black
woman? Isn't that why he finally gave up and left Cambridge for New
York?
</P>
<P>
   Of course it is harder for a woman, harder still for a black
woman, to break through the entrenched ranks of white men who
dominate this institution and others like it. But the events of the
last week are not about gender or racial bias or the glass ceiling.
They are about journalistic integrity, a phrase Patricia Smith and
her enablers at this newspaper have reduced to an oxymoron.

US TEAM AN INCH AHEAD, A MILE AWAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NANTES, France _ Some of the old boys posed for pictures on the
field inside the Stade de La Beaujoire at halftime of their final
match Thursday night. This was the last roundup, after all, and
once the US World Cup soccer team scattered it would never be
together again.
</P>
<P>
   Not these players. Not this coach. Not this federation
president. At least half of this team won't be around for the next
World Cup in 2002 _ assuming the US even qualifies. Steve Sampson,
whose coaching contract ends with the tournament, almost certainly
won't be asked back. And Alan Rothenberg, who's been president
since 1990, leaves office in August.
</P>
<P>
   So where do the Yanks go from here? Though its three-and-out
performance here was no better than what the overmatched college
kids managed in 1990, the US undeniably is further along the road
than it was eight years ago. The Americans were 500-1 shots then.
They were only 150-1 here. Such is progress in a country where
soccer is the fifth professional sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are inching forward as a world soccer power,'' Rothenberg
said after the US had lost respectably _ but still lost _ to
Germany, Iran, and Yugoslavia. ``We are not leaping forward. We are
inching forward.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Americans have the A team on the field, they have
proven they can play with anybody. On an exceptional day, they can
beat a Brazil, an Argentina, a Nigeria, an England, a Colombia _
and they have. But on the average day, they're around 25th in the
world and they'll admit it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not among the elite, but we can compete with any
second-tier European country or top South American country,'' says
Sampson. ``We are not at the point, player to player, to compete
with the best teams in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The best teams, the Germanys and Brazils and Italys and
Argentinas, have 100 or more international-level players to choose
from. The Americans have fewer than four dozen. The best teams' top
players are stars in Germany's Bundesliga, Italy's Serie A, the
English Premier League, and the Spanish league.
</P>
<P>
   With a few exceptions, the top US players are stars in the
fledgling Major League Soccer, playing against other Americans.
That's good enough to qualify from the North and Central American
and Caribbean region, but not to make it to the second round of the
Mondial. ``You need players at a highly, highly competitive level
for a long period of time to get results at this level,'' says
Sampson.
</P>
<P>
   But what really keeps the Yanks in the second tier is their
narrow pipeline, the trickle of fresh talent that is barely enough
to replace the thirtysomethings on rebuilt knees. They saw that
clearly at the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta, when the US lost by two
goals to Argentina. ``Argentina had six players who were starters
in Serie A,'' says Rothenberg. ```You know what this proves?' I
said to (secretary general) Hank Steinbrecher? `Their college kids
are a lot better than our college kids.'''
</P>
<P>
   Argentina's kids, of course, don't go to college. Nobody else's
kids do. They sign with pro clubs as juniors and are fast-tracked
to the national side. Ronaldo, Brazil's newborn king, was on its
Cup roster at 17. Michael Owen, England's boy wonder, is only 18.
The youngest player on the US squad here (Frankie Hejduk) is 23.
``We're always playing catch-up,'' says Sampson.
</P>
<P>
   So the US federation has decided to bypass the college route and
get its promising 18- to 22-year-olds playing against pros as
quickly as possible. With Project 40, which began last year,
players like the Revolution's Brian Dunseth may go to college (with
tuition paid) but they work out with MLS clubs (making minimum
salary), play in the A League, and train with overseas clubs like
Glasgow Rangers, Chile's Catolica, and Mexico's Atlas FC.
</P>
<P>
   US Soccer also wants to pull promising under-17s out of high
school and put them in a year-round residency program in Florida
with all expenses paid. It's all part of the federation's bold
(some would say delusional) Project 2010, with $50 million targeted
toward winning the World Cup a dozen years from now. ``If we can
put a man on the moon,'' says Steinbrecher, ``we can do this.''
</P>
<P>
   Putting a man on the moon may have been easier, because only the
Soviets were in the same game. The federation's plan has the Yanks,
who scored one goal here, reaching the quarterfinals next time. For
a start, they'll try to qualify again with a new plan, a new coach,
and new players and forget their three-and-out this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can try and rebuild and do better next time,'' old-boy
striker Eric Wynalda says. ``Because we can't let this happen
again.''

HIGH COURT CLARIFIES LAW ON WORKPLACE SEXUAL HARASSMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla.)  (mk) 
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court clarified the law on sexual
harassment in the workplace Friday, making some lawsuits against
employers easier to win while limiting the legal exposure of
companies that have effective anti-harassment policies in place.
</P>
<P>
   The pair of 7-2 decisions, issued on the final day of the
court's term, cut through a thicket of confusing and contradictory
lower-court rulings that had grown up in the 12 years since the
justices first ruled that sexual harassment was a form of
employment discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   Among the court's holdings was that an employee who resists a
supervisor's advances need not have suffered a tangible job
detriment, such as dismissal or loss of a promotion, in order to be
able to pursue a lawsuit against the company. But such a suit
cannot succeed, the court said, if the company has an
anti-harassment policy with an effective complaint procedure in
place and the employee has unreasonably failed to use it.
</P>
<P>
   The rulings won immediate praise across an unusually broad
spectrum of both management and civil rights groups for bringing
coherence to the law and providing incentives for preventing
harassment and dealing promptly with problems that occur.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a win-win for employers and for all the women of
America,'' Kathy Rodgers, executive director of the NOW Legal
Defense and Education Fund, said in a comment virtually echoed by a
lawyer for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court responded to our cries in the wilderness for clear,
bright-line standards so employers will know what to do,'' Robin
Conrad, senior vice president of the chamber's legal arm, said in
an interview. She called the rulings ``fair and reasonable.''
</P>
<P>
   Taken together, the two decisions had an almost legislative
sweep, establishing a regime of clearly defined rights and
responsibilities for companies and their employees. Both were
interpretations of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which
prohibits sex discrimination in the workplace.
</P>
<P>
   One of the decisions awarded judgment to a former lifeguard who
sued the city of Boca Raton, Fla., for failing to protect her from
years of harassment by her supervisors. The other made a large
corporate employer presumptively liable for a supervisor's
harassment of a lower-level employee _ although the woman in fact
received a promotion _ but gave the company a new chance to show in
its defense that it had a good complaint policy in place that the
plaintiff did not use.
</P>
<P>
   This second case, Burlington Industries Inc. vs. Ellerth, No.
97-569, was being closely scrutinized Friday as offering a
potential clue to the future of the Paula Jones sexual harassment
lawsuit against President Clinton. A U.S. District judge in Little
Rock, Ark., dismissed that suit in April, based in part on
precedent in the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which covers
Little Rock, that made proof of a ``tangible job detriment'' a
necessary element of harassment claim of the type Mrs. Jones
brought against Clinton. Mrs. Jones has appealed to the 8th Circuit
seeking reinstatement of her lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   While the decision Friday invalidated the circuit's precedent,
the ruling will not necessarily affect the outcome of Mrs. Jones'
appeal. In dismissing the suit, Judge Susan Webber Wright found
that Mrs. Jones could not prevail under any legal standard because
she had offered no evidence that Clinton had threatened her with
job-related consequences.
</P>
<P>
   The decisions Friday in both the Burlington Industries case and
the lifeguard's lawsuit, Faragher vs. City of Boca Raton, No.
97-282, were supported by the same group of justices. Justice
Anthony Kennedy wrote the Burlington decision and Justice David
Souter wrote the Boca Raton decision. Chief Justice William
Rehnquist and Justices John Paul Stevens, Sandra Day O'Connor, Ruth
Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer also voted in both majorities.
Justices Clarence Thomas and Antonin Scalia dissented in both
cases.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Supreme Court decisions had concerned themselves
principally with defining sexual harassment and had spoken only
vaguely on the crucial question of how an employee, experiencing
harassment by a supervisor, can make the company legally
responsible. Without employer liability, there is no action under
Title VII, which refers to the ``terms, conditions, or privileges
of employment.''
</P>
<P>
   Previous decisions had established that an employee who suffered
a job-related injury from resisting a supervisor's ``quid pro quo''
demand for sexual favors had a legal cause of action against the
employer, and that rule was reinforced Friday. ``A tangible
employment decision requires an official act of the enterprise, a
company act,'' Kennedy said in the Burlington case.
</P>
<P>
   But the law was much less clear in two other situations: when an
employee was forced to endure a sexually hostile environment, as in
the Boca Raton case, where no specific demand was made but where
unwanted touching and crude remarks were pervasive over a long
period; and when demands were resisted but no job detriment ensued,
as in the Burlington case.
</P>
<P>
   The lower federal courts had become entangled in a maze of
inquiries about whether supervisors in these situations could be
described as acting within the scope of their official authority
or, if not, whether the employer could be held responsible for a
supervisor's unauthorized search for personal gratification. In the
Boca Raton case, for example, the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals, in Atlanta, had ruled that the two supervisory lifeguards
who harassed Beth Ann Faragher were not acting within the scope of
their employment and that the city thus was not responsible for
their actions.
</P>
<P>
   Further adding to the confusion, the lower courts disagreed on
whether to hold an employer responsible only if high-level
officials ``knew or should have known'' of the harassment _ a
negligence standard that is difficult for plaintiffs to meet _ and
also on the extent to which a published anti-harassment policy
should immunize a company from liability.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In both their opinions Friday, Souter and Kennedy said the
effort to draw neat boundaries around categories of harassment or
aspects of supervisors' behavior had proven unsuccessful. The
distinction between a ``quid pro quo'' case and a ``hostile work
environment'' case was of ``limited utility,'' Kennedy said. He
said it was necessary to step back and examine the ``basic
policies'' underlying Title VII, which he said included
``encouraging forethought by employers'' as well as actions by
employees to mitigate harm to themselves.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, both decisions incorporated an identical, page-long
set of rules under which harassment cases are to proceed. The rules
establish the following:
</P>
<P>
   _ Employers are responsible for harassment engaged in by their
supervisory employees.
</P>
<P>
   _ When the harassment results in ``a tangible employment action,
such as discharge, demotion, or undesirable reassignment,'' the
employer's liability is absolute.
</P>
<P>
   _ When there has been no tangible action, an employer can defend
itself if it can prove two things: first, that it has taken
``reasonable care to prevent and correct promptly any sexually
harassing behavior,'' such as by adopting an effective policy with
a complaint procedure; and second, that the employee ``unreasonably
failed to take advantage of any preventive or corrective
opportunities'' provided.
</P>
<P>
   Applying this framework in the Burlington case, the court said
that the plaintiff, Kimberly Ellerth, should have a chance at trial
to prove her case and that, at the same time, the company should
have the chance to assert a defense. The decision affirmed a ruling
by the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in Chicago, which had
found Ms. Ellerth entitled to a trial.
</P>
<P>
   In a dissenting opinion in the Burlington case, Thomas said
employers should face liability only for their own negligence. His
opinion, which Scalia also signed, accused the majority of
``willful policymaking, pure and simple,'' under which ``employer
liability very well may be the rule.''
</P>
<P>
   Several lawyers said Friday that future cases would be needed to
elaborate on what employers need to do to make their
anti-harassment policies effective. Eric Schnapper, a civil rights
expert at the University of Washington Law School, said the
greatest impact of the rulings would be to change the employer's
incentive system from one of ``don't ask, don't tell to having
proven and effective policies in place.''

OPPOSITES ATTRACT IN `OUT OF SIGHT' 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LOUIS B. PARKS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Early in ``Out of Sight,'' bank robber Jack Foley and federal
marshal Karen Sisco spend unplanned time together locked in the
trunk of a big Chevy.
</P>
<P>
   How they got there is not really important. What they do there
is essential to the movie. They talk.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the situation _ she's his hostage, he's covered with
sewer mud _ they find out they share interests, such as a love of
movies. They learn that they can immediately do what some couples
never learn to do, enjoy chatting with each other.
</P>
<P>
   The scene is a small part of the movie, but the rest of the
story grows from it. Like the same scene in Elmore Leonard's novel,
it lets us know right away that this movie has a quirky sense of
humor and romance, and that the relationship of these characters is
more important than the specifics of the plot.
</P>
<P>
   When you read a minireview of the movie next year in some TV
guidebook, it will probably say the movie is about some guys
pulling a diamond caper. As far as that goes, it's true. There is a
home break-in at the climax of the movie, and through most of the
film, the principal characters are working toward making that
happen.
</P>
<P>
   But that misses the point.
</P>
<P>
   The heart of ``Out of Sight'' is the impossible romance between
Foley, a career criminal who George Clooney plays as charming and
smart but not very practical, and Sisco, who Jennifer Lopez plays
as a dedicated officer, one who figures you should never let a good
man get away, even if you plan to arrest him.
</P>
<P>
   Foley, who has just escaped from prison in Florida, is America's
busiest bank robber. He has knocked over hundreds of banks, all
without a gun.
</P>
<P>
   We get to watch one of Foley's bank jobs. He strolls to the
teller's window and tells her to look over at the manager's desk.
The guy sitting with the manager, Foley tells her, is his partner,
and he is holding a gun and will shoot the manager if she does not
fork over some cash.
</P>
<P>
   It's not true _ Foley doesn't even know the guy. But he is so
confident and charming that she believes him and pays up.
</P>
<P>
   Jersey Films, which brought Leonard's ``Get Shorty'' to the
screen, has put together this movie, again using the services of
screenwriter Scott Frank. Frank has wisely played up the most
interesting part of the book, the relationship between male robber
and female marshal. He's also kept the humor and smart dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   More important, Frank has not succumbed to the temptation of
turning this into an overblown action movie, even though there are
several action scenes and a climactic heist.
</P>
<P>
   In the same vein, Steven Soderbergh (``sex, lies and
videotape,'' ``King of the Hill'') was brought in to direct. You
don't hire someone of Soderbergh's subtle touch with characters and
dialogue when you're trying to sell explosions and car chases. It
turned out to be a splendid choice. Soderbergh thrives on nuance
and conversation, and his actors and the audience profit.
</P>
<P>
   While ``Get Shorty'' emphasized comedy and ``Jackie Brown'' (the
movie adaptation of Leonard's ``Rum Punch'') emphasized character
quirks, dialogue and violence, this movie is a mellower blend. The
result is entertaining, at once sexy, funny, quirky and romantic,
with dashes of excitement from time to time.
</P>
<P>
   Don't get the idea this is a romantic comedy to take the kids
to. The movie does have violence, some played as dark humor. Crime
language and nasty types abound.
</P>
<P>
   While Foley is trying to figure a way to get together with Sisco
again without having her haul him to jail, he teams with an old
partner, Buddy, played in the best trusty-pal style by Ving Rhames.
Buddy is determined to keep Foley out of trouble.
</P>
<P>
   They reluctantly get into a heist plan orchestrated by a former
prison mate, hilariously played by Steve Zahn. Zahn (``The Object
of My Affection'') just might get an Oscar nomination out of this
role. He's delightfully pathetic as an amoral, dumb druggie and
steals every scene he's in.
</P>
<P>
   Also involved: Don Cheadle (``Devil in a Blue Dress''), scary as
a low-life violent criminal named Snoopy; Dennis Farina as Sisco's
dad, a former cop who makes wisecracks about his daughter's
infatuation with a bank robber; and Albert Brooks as the
millionaire who talked too much about his hidden diamonds when he
was in prison.
</P>
<P>
   In an uncredited inside joke, Michael Keaton shows up as Sisco's
boyfriend Ray Nicolet, the same law officer Keaton played in
``Jackie Brown.''
</P>
<P>
   The core of the movie depends on Clooney and Lopez, however, and
they make an unusual but fun romantic team.
</P>
<P>
   Clooney's personal likability really shows up on screen, and
it's a good thing, since we have to like his outlaw character or
the movie doesn't work. His Jack Foley is an easygoing guy, the
kind who can't help waving when he sees someone he knows, even if
she is trying to arrest him.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez (``Selena'') gives Sisco enough of an edge so that we can
believe that, just maybe, she could look beyond Foley's bad habit
of robbing banks and find him charming. But she's still a good
officer and not likely to let him go free.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is light as a feather fluff. Just what Leonard fans
would hope for.
</P>
<P>
   ``Out of Sight'' is rated R for language and some strong
violence.
</P>

HIGH COURT RULINGS FAVOR VICTIMS OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a victory for sexual harassment victims, the
Supreme Court ruled Friday that employers are liable for
supervisors who fire, demote or reassign a subordinate for spurning
unwelcome sexual advances, even if the companies were unaware of
the misbehavior.
</P>
<P>
   In a pair of 7-2 rulings, the justices also said employers are
presumed liable for harassment by supervisors even when the
misconduct does not result in the victim's dismissal, demotion or
reassignment.
</P>
<P>
   Companies can avoid liability if they prove they acted quickly
to prevent the harassment and that the victim failed to take
advantage of the employers' procedures for reporting the workplace
harm, the court added.
</P>
<P>
   A women's rights group hailed the broad interpretation of Title
VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act as a ``great day for working
women.'' Martha Davis of the NOW Legal Defense and Education Fund,
added, ``The decisions affirm that the purpose of Title VII is to
prevent harm ... and that employers are in the best position to do
that.''
</P>
<P>
   A leading business group said the high court made clear that
employers and employees both play roles in preventing harassment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The employer is responsible for setting guidelines, and the
employee is responsible for following them,'' said Stephen Bokat,
the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's general counsel. ``That's a position
the chamber has held for a long time, and finally the Supreme Court
has recognized that employees have certain obligations, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The high court, over the objection of two of its most
conservative members, said companies have a heavy legal burden in
harassment cases because they hired the supervisors and gave them
authority over other employees. Having bestowed the authority, the
companies cannot claim ignorance of what their supervisors are
doing, the court said on the last day of its 1997-1998 term.
</P>
<P>
   ``Recognition of employer liability when discriminatory misuse
of supervisory authority alters the terms and conditions of a
victim's employment is underscored by the fact that the employer
has a greater opportunity to guard against misconduct by
supervisors than by common workers; employers have greater
opportunity and incentive to screen them, train them and monitor
their performance,'' Justice David H. Souter wrote for the court in
Faragher vs. Boca Raton, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   In that case, the high court held the city liable for the
unwelcome touching and lewd comments that Beth Ann Faragher endured
from supervisors Bill Terry and David Silverman while working as a
lifeguard at a Boca Raton beach. The city has no defense to the
harassment claim because it took no action to keep track of its
supervisory lifeguards and failed to disseminate its policy
prohibiting harassment to its beach staff, the court said.
</P>
<P>
   In the other case, the justices said a company could be held
liable for a supervisor who allegedly harassed _ but nevertheless
promoted _ a female subordinate who rejected his unwelcome
advances. In sending the case back for trial, the justices said
Kimberly Ellerth would first have to show she was harassed by her
supervisor, Ted Slowik.
</P>
<P>
   Burlington Industries Inc. could then avoid liability by showing
it ``exercised reasonable care to prevent and correct promptly any
sexually harassing behavior,'' the court said. The company also
would have to show that Ellerth ``unreasonably failed to take
advantage of any preventive or corrective opportunities provided by
the employer or to avoid harm otherwise,'' the justices added.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, writing for the majority in the
Ellerth case, said a corporate policy prohibiting harassment is not
necessary for defending against a lawsuit, but it can help the
company show the victim had a way to stop the harassment short of
litigation. However, even the strongest anti-harassment policy will
not save a company from liability if a supervisor's shenanigans led
to a ``tangible'' employment action, such as the victim's
dismissal, discharge or undesirable reassignment, Kennedy added.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tangible employment actions are the means by which the
supervisor brings the official power of the enterprise (company) to
bear on subordinates,'' Kennedy wrote. ``In that instance, it would
be implausible to interpret (legal) principles to allow an employer
to escape liability.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the ruling in the Ellerth case indicates liability for
harassment is possible even without tangible employment action such
as demotion or firing, the case may make it easier for Paula Jones
to revive her lawsuit against President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Jones accused Clinton of propositioning her when he was Arkansas
governor and she was a state employee. A federal judge threw out
the lawsuit, ruling that employees can collect damages only if
their refusal to submit to sexual demands results in retaliation on
the job. The judge ruled Jones could show no adverse employment
consequences from spurning Clinton's alleged advance.
</P>
<P>
   The impact of the high court's ruling for Jones' case could be
limited because the judge who dismissed her lawsuit said she did
not show that Clinton ever made a clear threat of retaliation.
</P>
<P>
   Justices Clarence Thomas and Antonin Scalia dissented in both
cases decided by the high court. Thomas, joined by Scalia, said a
company should not be held liable unless the harassing supervisor
fired, demoted or reassigned the victim or the company negligently
permitted the misconduct to occur.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is, liability should attach only if the employer either
knew, or in the exercise of reasonable care should have known,
about the hostile work environment and failed to take remedial
action,'' Thomas wrote. ``Harassment is simply not something that
employers can wholly prevent without taking extraordinary measures
_ constant video and audio surveillance for example _ that would
revolutionize the workplace in a manner incompatible with a free
society.''

PRISON CULTURE SEEN SPAWNING RACIST VIOLENCE AMONG YOUTHFUL POOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TENNESSEE COLONY, Texas _ Tensions are rising with the
temperature, which has just hit 100 degrees, in the gritty
penitentiary where two white supremacists accused of James Byrd
Jr.'s brutal slaying were schooled in racial hatred.
</P>
<P>
   On a sweltering cellblock where John William King and Lawrence
Russell Brewer were caught two years ago with drawings of swastikas
and tattoo stencils for symbols of the Ku Klux Klan, groups of
black, white and Hispanic inmates linger in a crowded day room.
They are separated by steel benches and self-imposed segregation.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, a corrections officer totes a ``gas gun'' to unleash
chemical agents if violence erupts.
</P>
<P>
   This is the George Beto Unit of the Texas corrections system, a
sprawling, steel-roofed prison ringed with glistening razor wire
and occupied by 3,264 felons in an unforgiving world of fear and
enmity. The population is ruled largely by separatist gangs prone
to violence, notably the Aryan Brotherhood, the Mexican Mafia and
the Crips.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever their racial feelings were before they entered the
unit, King, 23, and Brewer, 31, left as converts to its distorted
values. They had yet to reach their first anniversary away from
Beto when they were charged with killing Byrd, a 49-year-old
disabled grandfather, by chaining him to the back of a pickup truck
on June 7 and dragging him nearly three miles on a country road in
Jasper, Texas, tearing his body apart.
</P>
<P>
   A third suspect, Shawn Allen Berry, 23, told police that King,
the alleged ringleader, ranted racist-laced vulgarities throughout
the atrocity.
</P>
<P>
   As the FBI, state and local authorities braced Friday for a Ku
Klux Klan rally Saturday in Jasper that black militant groups have
vowed to attend, specialists in prison hate groups offered an
answer to the painful question King's father, Ronald, reportedly
asked his son before the killing: ``Where did the hatred in your
heart come from?''
</P>
<P>
   The answer, the specialists said, may rest in the prison culture
that feeds on young, poorly-educated inmates vulnerable to racist
ideology. When King and Brewer were paroled last year from the Beto
Unit, they bore little resemblance to the petty criminals whose
drug and property crimes had landed them behind bars, friends and
relatives said this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prisons are really graduate schools of hate,'' said Brian
Levin, director of the Center on Hate and Extremism at Richard
Stockton College in New Jersey. ``Even people who are not hard-core
hatemongers when they go in can get caught in the web of hatred and
be stuck in it when they come out.''
</P>
<P>
   The Beto Unit's senior warden, Herbert L. Scott, said many
inmates join gangs as a form of self-defense _ ``to make their
lives more comfortable,'' as Scott put it. But Scott said King and
Brewer have no one to blame but themselves for their actions beyond
the prison walls.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had an opportunity to go out there and do good,'' he
said. ``They are the ones who made a choice to do what they are
alleged to have done, not the gangs.''
</P>
<P>
   King, who served 25 months of an 8-year sentence for burglary,
``was a real quiet kid, always very sweet'' when he was growing up
in Jasper, said Deanna Job, who described herself as a distant
cousin and former classmate of King. ``He always went with us to
church.''
</P>
<P>
   But King, it seemed, changed in prison. ``I barely recognized
him when he came out,'' she said. ``He was much bigger and had a
lots of tattoos, and none of them said, `Mom.'''
</P>
<P>
   At Beto, King hooked up with Brewer, who was serving six years
of a 22-year sentence for burglary and drug possession. The pair
served two years together in a towering, three-tier cellblock with
nearly 400 other inmates.
</P>
<P>
   The Beto Unit, home to every category of felon from embezzler to
serial killer, is situated on a remote country road 150 miles
northwest of Jasper, a city of 8,000 near the Texas border with
Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 2,700 inmates confined this week in the general
population, 48 percent were black, 31 percent, white, and 20
percent, Hispanic. Rarely do they mingle across racial or ethnic
lines.
</P>
<P>
   Beto, like most prisons, ``has a large problem with gangs,''
said Captain Robert Emerson, as he led a visitor through cellblocks
teeming with inmates clad in sweat-soaked white clothing. ``A lot
of the guys here succumb to the pressure to join the gangs.''
</P>
<P>
   Brewer and King, who were monitored in prison for possible
affiliation with the KKK and an affiliated group, the Confederate
Knights of America, bore tattoos associated with both organizations
when they were arrested a day after Byrd's mutilated body was
found.
</P>
<P>
   Prison officials said Brewer was disciplined in 1995 for joining
other whites in ``a rumble'' with Hispanic inmates. And relatives
said King had increasingly expressed racist ideology, even after he
was paroled last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``He went in a street punk and came out a white supremacist,''
said John R. Craig, who is familiar with King's family and is
co-author of ``Soldiers of God,'' a recently published book on
white supremacy. ``It was a complete metamorphosis.''
</P>
<P>
   Berry, who was sharing a small apartment in Jasper with King and
Brewer at the time of Byrd's murder, was the only member of the
group who bad never experienced the pressures of a lengthy prison
term. Berry and King were arrested together for burglary in 1991
and ordered to a 90-day boot camp for youthful offenders, which
both successfully completed in lieu of 10-year prison sentences.
</P>
<P>
   But only Berry met the terms of his parole. In 1995, King was
charged with technical parole violations and and sent to Beto, for
his first, harsh taste of prison life.
</P>
<P>
   In prison, authorities said, most inmates join gangs or looser
affiliations for fear of being beaten, raped or killed. Or, as
Brewer's lawyer, Bill Morian Jr., has said, they join gangs to
avoid becoming another inmate's ``wife.''
</P>
<P>
   Protection, however, often comes with an enforced ideology.
Before leaving Beto, King had switched his religious affiliation
from Baptist to Odinism, an ancient Nordic doctrine based on white
superiority. And Brewer, who reported no religious affiliation when
he entered Beto, joined Christian Identity, a movement whose
leaders also preach neo-Nazi beliefs about white supremacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time in their lives, guys like them are told
they are special by the prison preachers,'' Craig said, referring
to self-appointed inmate proselytizers. ``They are told, 'You are
an Aryan, God has chosen you. We need to take the country back.'
And they become consumed by it.''
</P>
<P>
   When King and Brewer returned to Jasper, a struggling timber
town, vestiges of racism lingered nearly 30 years after racial
segregation ended in the county schoools. Although the mayor and
several other civic leaders were black, a KKK chapter purportedly
has operated in the county since 1986.
</P>
<P>
   That year, white supremacists burned crosses throughout the city
of Kountze, south of Jasper, after three black men, including a
Jasper teen-ager, were charged with raping two white girls.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, the KKK threatened violence in nearby Vidor after a
federal judge ordered the city's all-white housing developments to
be racially integrated.
</P>
<P>
   And by the time King and Brewer had returned to Jasper, Craig
said, a white militia group was operating a 200-acre training
ground in the county. In addition, a Christian Identity faction had
taken over a small, independent church in the county, Craig said.
</P>
<P>
   Police said King and Brewer attacked Byrd out of anger that
Berry offered Byrd a ride late at night as he was walking on Martin
Luther King Drive near his childhood home in Jasper. At the height
of the horror that followed, police said, Berry asked King to let
him out of the truck as it pulled Byrd through a remote, nearly
all-black neighborhood. But King refused, as the truck churned past
the Rosebloom Bapist Church and approached a cemetery gate, where
the assailants unchained the remainder of Byrd's body.
</P>
<P>
   Police said there was no room for Berry's unease in King's code
of racial hatred. ``You're just as guilty as we are,'' a police
affidavit quoted King as telling Berry. ``Besides, the same thing
could happen to a n----- lover.''

2 JAPANESE BANKS IN TALKS ABOUT MERGING 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: See also JAPAN-BANKS) 
(mk) 
 By SHERYL WuDUNN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Long-Term Credit Bank, one of Japan's biggest and
weakest financial institutions, is in negotiations to merge with a
smaller, stronger rival, a move that could turn the combined bank
into a showcase for the government's first blueprint to clean up
the nation's bad debt.
</P>
<P>
   If Long-Term's talks with Sumitomo Trust &AMP; Banking Co. succeed,
it would create a bank with $316 billion in assets, slightly behind
Chase Manhattan Corp., the biggest bank in the United States with
$364.7 billion in assets. It could also end several weeks of
worries that financial troubles at Long-Term could spread and
endanger financial stability in Japan, which already is suffering
from its worst postwar economic performance, a weakening currency
and a jittery stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese news media reported Friday that a deal was possible,
and both banks confirmed later in separate news conferences that
they were in talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a bit of a crisis of confidence in the financial
system, and confidence needs to be restored,'' said James Fiorillo,
a financial analyst at ING Barings. ``Investors have demanded
action and they're getting it.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal would effectively mean that Sumitomo Trust, with $118
billion in assets, would absorb Long-Term, the nation's
10th-largest financial institution, with $198 billion in assets.
Though trading was halted in the stocks of the two companies after
word of the talks surfaced, Long-Term shares rose nearly 26
percent. Sumitomo shares fell 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Koichi Kato, secretary general of the governing Liberal
Democratic Party, welcomed the talks, though he denied reports that
party leaders had helped broker them. Nonetheless, a deal would
offer a timely opportunity for the government to put into practice
a blueprint it calls the Total Plan, aimed at tackling the nation's
$600 billion in bad debt held by banks, considered an underlying
cause of Japan's economic malaise.
</P>
<P>
   As part of that plan, Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto Friday
called for the establishment of a ``bridge bank'' to assume the
loans and clients of a failed institution. It would operate like
Resolution Trust Corp., set up by Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
under a 1987 law aimed at resolving the savings and loan crisis in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   A deal between Sumitomo Trust and Long-Term is by no means
certain. The talks already have raised questions about the role of
Swiss Banking Corp., which just began joint ventures with Long-Term
in asset management and securities.
</P>
<P>
   Sumitomo Trust officials, who said they were approached by
Long-Term about a merger, suggested Friday night that Sumitomo
itself was interested in becoming a ``global player.''
</P>
<P>
   Sumitomo is one of Japan's largest trust banks, which specialize
in managing funds for large institutional investors.
</P>
<P>
   Long-Term is one of three Japanese credit banks established at
the end of World War II to provide long-term business loans in an
effort to rebuild Japan's economy.
</P>
<P>
   Bankers and analysts say Long-Term had been encountering
increasing difficulty securing funds in the interbank loan market,
a critical source of financing for all banks. On Friday the bank
said it met routine repayments on five-year and one-year debt
securities, worth roughly about $2.8 billion. Long-Term's
president, Katsunobu Ohnogi, insisted that the bank was ``not
insolvent.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But analysts say that some foreign financial institutions,
concerned about Long-Term's health, were not eager to continue
purchasing the bank's debt securities. Moreover, such concerns make
the bank highly vulnerable to any sudden shocks, so that it needs
to conclude a rescue deal quickly.
</P>
<P>
   The success of the deal would depend partly on the degree of
public funds Sumitomo could get from the government in exchange for
absorbing Long-Term, which has about $10.4 billion in bad loans.
Sumitomo said Friday that it had no plans to take over that bad
debt.
</P>
<P>
   Atsushi Takahashi, president of Sumitomo, said he had received
assurances from the governor of the Bank of Japan, the nation's
central bank, and from the commissioner of the Financial
Supervisory Agency, that Sumitomo would receive full support if it
absorbed Long-Term.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't set a deadline for the merger,'' Takahashi said at a
news conference. ``I think the merger would be better if it comes
earlier.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, there has been concern that Long-Term may be burdened
by problems with its affiliate leasing and financing companies,
which bankers say have billions of dollars worth of outstanding
loans _ many of them property-related.
</P>
<P>
   Bankers say one reason for Sumitomo's decision to negotiate with
Long-Term may have been that it, too, has large amounts of
outstanding loans to affiliate companies of Long-Term. So, by
rescuing Long-Term, Sumitomo may be seeking to avoid greater
troubles of its own.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Takahashi made it clear that if the talks
succeeded, Sumitomo would be running the new operation.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts worried that the proposed takeover was a reversion
to the old-style of arranged unions. Others suggested that if the
government created a bridge bank that took over Long-Term's bad
loans, and if Sumitomo received public money to help it manage the
expanded institution, then Long-Term's shareholders might lose out
and the value of their shares could plummet.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the United States, where investors generally like
to own stocks in companies that are rescued, in Japan the opposite
could happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it is decided that LTCB shareholders lose everything, then
immediately, the market will divide the Japanese banks into the
predators and the prey,'' said Brian Waterhouse, financial analyst
at HSBC Securities Japan Ltd. ``And the prey, you don't want to
own.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ AT&AMP;T's planned $31.8 billion merger with
Tele-Communications Inc. threw the spotlight last week on a bit of
Wall Street arcana, the so-called tracking stocks.
</P>
<P>
   If the merger happens, AT&AMP;T will float a new tracking stock that
will reflect the fortunes of its consumer services division, a mix
of long-distance, wireless, cable and Internet services.
</P>
<P>
   Should investors rush to buy AT&AMP;T's new stock when it is issued?
Should current AT&AMP;T shareholders hang on to the tracking stock they
will receive in the merger?
</P>
<P>
   Not necessarily, in either case. Because of their structure,
tracking stocks are great for the corporations issuing them. For
investors, they pose more risks.
</P>
<P>
   Owners of tracking shares have neither voting rights nor
ownership in the specific corporate assets whose performance the
stocks reflect. All a tracking stock gives investors is a way to
bet on one aspect of a diversified company's operations.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate issuers are hands-down winners in tracking stocks.
Because the stocks focus investor attention on a particular piece
of a company, they are usually issued with the hope that they will
receive a higher market valuation than the parent company receives
from investors confused by its jumble of properties. This means
more money to the company bringing the tracking stock public.
</P>
<P>
   Companies usually issue tracking shares on a hot piece of their
business. Sprint, for example, recently announced plans to issue a
stock to track its wireless telecommunications business, known as
PCS Sprint is new to this business, but rivals' stocks trade at
enviable price-to-earnings multiples.
</P>
<P>
   Airtouch Communications, for example, trades at 60 times its
latest 12 months' earnings. Sprint's overall multiple is 35.
</P>
<P>
   David Eidelman, a money manager at Eidelman, Finger &AMP; Harris in
St. Louis, has never owned tracking shares for his clients. ``I
wasn't exactly sure what I was getting in a tracking stock,'' he
said. ``And I always wondered if the parent company can monkey with
them.'' To fetch a high price on a tracking stock it planned to
issue, Eidelman said, a company could tweak profits at the related
subsidiary before the offering. Earnings subsequently could fall,
disappointing investors.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, because tracking stocks are often issued by a company to
capitalize on a business that is strong at the moment, many of the
newer ones are now trading below their offering prices. The
electronics retailer Circuit City Stores issued tracking shares on
its used-car operation, Carmax, on Feb. 7, 1997, at $20 each.
</P>
<P>
   The stock hit $21 four days later but fell to $6.50 in January.
On Friday, Carmax shares closed at $8.5625. An investor in the
parent company would have had a 40 percent gain for the period.
</P>
<P>
   Other examples include the Genzyme Corp.'s tissue-repair
subsidiary, a developer of products for cartilage and burn damage,
which issued a tracking stock last November at $7.75 a share. It
rose to $9.125 in March but traded at $5.75 on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia-Pacific issued a tracking stock on its timber operations
last December, which began trading at $28.25. It is now at $23.
</P>
<P>
   Not all tracking stocks go down, of course. TCI has two, Liberty
Media Group and TCI Ventures, that are up 68 percent and 40
percent, respectively, this year. But investors in tracking stocks
are making a very narrow bet on a company. If proved wrong, they
will have none of a company's diversified activities to cushion a
fall. &QL;

AMID SLOW PROGRESS, CONCERN FOR HUMAN RIGHTS IN CHINA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By INDIRA A.R. LAKSHMANAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Nine years have passed since Chinese troops rolled
down the Avenue of Eternal Peace to Tiananmen Square, killing
hundreds or perhaps more than 1,000 peaceful pro-reform
demonstrators, and much has changed in China. Yet the government
has never admitted any wrongdoing for June 4, 1989, and Dai Qing
still cannot hold back a stream of tears when she tries to talk
about it.
</P>
<P>
   A writer who supported the student protestors and was detained
for 10 months without being charged following the crackdown, Dai,
lives under intermittent surveillance, is not allowed to hold a job
and cannot publish her writings in China. It is a fate similar to
that endured by countless others whom the government considers a
threat to the state.
</P>
<P>
   And yet outside the high-profile human rights fight erupting
during President Clinton's visit, Dai and many other government
critics say that human rights are far better in China than at any
time in the history of the communist state. There are fewer
restrictions on where people can live and work, on who they can
marry and what property they can own. Surveillance is spottier and
punishments lighter. Efforts are under &UR;  &LR; way to revise the law and
make the government more accountable. Perhaps most significantly,
people are beginning to develop an awareness of individual rights.
</P>
<P>
   Still, despite the progress, China has a poor human rights
record by Western standards. This is still a one-party state that
prohibits direct challenges to its authority. Democracy campaigners
are routinely harassed, detained without charges or jailed after
summary trials. Religious expression outside state-approved venues
is severely restricted. Forced prison labor and trafficking in
convicts' organs has been documented.
</P>
<P>
   All of this is damning fodder for critics of President Clinton's
policy of engaging China, who say he has subjugated the human
rights of 1.2 billion Chinese citizens to business interests of
Americans eager to enter the Chinese market. But defenders _
including many prominent Chinese dissidents _ say that while they
aren't thrilled to see Clinton receiving a military welcome
Saturday in a square that was the scene of bloodshed, maintaining
close ties with Beijing is the best way for the US to promote human
rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Students withdrew from the Square and tanks followed and
killed them, and our regime hasn't punished those soldiers or
officials,'' Dai said, choking on sobs. But after taking a deep
breath, she added: ``Yet worse things have happened in China, but
only this is known by the world.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Human rights is not just political prisoners. It is ordinary
people changing their living standard bit by bit. This is the most
important thing, along with using the law to defend them and
building their independent spirit,'' she said. ``Business links
with China keep the door open so the whole situation will change,
including human rights.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been a quarter-century since President Richard M. Nixon
made his first overtures to a far more hermetic and repressive
China, and several years since Clinton began to melt the
post-Tiananmen freeze and approach Beijing's leaders as partners
rather than pariahs. So how far have human rights progressed since
then?
</P>
<P>
   According to Amnesty International's 1998 annual report,
hundreds or possibly thousands of suspected opponents of the regime
were detained last year, while thousands of political prisoners
remained behind bars _ often as a result of unfair trials. Torture
and ill-treatment were widespread, Amnesty said. And minorities
considered threats to national unity _ Tibetan Buddhists, Xinjiang
Muslims, Roman Catholics who recognize the Pope and Protestants
belonging to unofficial churches _ were persecuted. Protests by
laid-off workers and people displaced by forced relocations were
halted.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, when China is in an international media spotlight,
government critics have been detained or sent out of their
hometowns to prevent them from encountering or disrupting President
Clinton's state visit.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, any repeat visitor to China can see that the lives of
the common people who far outnumber activists and persecuted
minorities seems to be steadily improving. Most advances are
economic ones, but they have allowed freedoms of choice that in
themselves represent expanded rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our whole society is getting richer bit by bit, and with that
comes more stable education, a middle class, independent voices and
a more independent press,'' said Dai. ``Eventually independent
parties will emerge.''
</P>
<P>
   Xu Yonghai, 37, is a psychologist and member of an underground
Christian church who was kept in solitary confinement from 1995 to
1997 after signing a letter calling for reforms. He is still
watched and his Bible study groups are sometimes stopped.
</P>
<P>
   ``But remember: Twenty years ago, I could have been sentenced to
death; 10 years ago, maybe (sentenced) for many, many years. Now
they just watch me,'' he said, gesturing to a small brick
watchhouse security forces built outside his home. ``I agree that
Clinton should engage China, because if he isolates us, our
democratic process will stop. If they engage us, we can learn from
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Xu Wenli, 54, a leading figure in the 1978-79 Democracy Wall
movement who was sentenced to prison in 1981 and released 12 years
later only when China was applying to host the Olympic Games, said
outsiders miss the point when they think of human rights mainly in
terms of dissidents like himself.
</P>
<P>
   True, he lives under constant surveillance, has had his computer
and notes seized, and twice this year, has been detained for a few
days. This week, he was prevented from leaving his home for an
interview with the Globe and had to speak to a reporter by
telephone. But he sees limits on his freedoms as far less important
than the expansion of common people's awareness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think more about changing society's sense of human rights.
Over the last 20 years, people are waking up gradually,'' he said.
``Awareness of rights has improved a lot, even in simple ways.
Today, at the supermarket, if a guard wants to search someone's
pocket, the person would probably feel humiliated and fight him.
Before, they would have thought it was normal.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton can help promote that grassroots sentiment only if he
presses leaders and demands they implement the reforms that they
are touting _ such as signing UN charters on rights and overhauling
the legal system, Xu said. Last year, China abolished the crime of
``counterrevolution,'' yet it has not reviewed the cases of some
2,000 imprisoned under that charge.
</P>
<P>
   Robin Munro of the human rights group Asia Watch complained that
China has failed to abide not only by international norms, but by
its own laws. ``If the PRC were to observe its own Constitution,
that would do more for human rights than the signing of any new
document. The Constitution guarantees freedom of speech and freedom
of assembly.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, says Dai, as much as the Party cracks down out of
fear, human rights abuses undermine rather than strengthen its
authority.
</P>
<P>
   She tells of a young man she met who was almost mowed down by a
tank in Tiananmen Square, just as the central post office clock
struck 6 a.m. and began to play the classic Communist Party song,
``The Sun Rises in the East.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He had loved this country and the Party, but that morning when
he heard that song as the People's Army turned against him, all his
love disappeared,'' recounted Dai, who publicly renounced her Party
membership after the massacre. ``And so who lost? The Communist
Party killed hundreds of people. But the Party is the loser.
Because today, people only love money, they are empty inside. Who
loves the Party?''

A CAUTIONARY TALE OF CHICANERY IN RUSSIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Not long ago, Andrei Kozlenok was a poster boy for the
Russian new rich, a brash young magnate with powerful Kremlin
friends, a lucrative gem-processing business in the United States
and a talent for spending huge sums on luxuries.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Kozlenok, 38, has become a symbol of the darker side of
post-Communist Russia's early years, when senior government
officials are believed to have routinely signed off on deals that
bilked the state out of hundreds of millions of dollars
</P>
<P>
   None of these scams has ever been brought to light, and no
minister has ever been brought to trial for corruption.
</P>
<P>
   But now, Kozlenok (pronounced Kaz-len-OAK) has been charged with
swindling the Russian government out of $180 million worth of gold
and diamonds. As he awaits his fate in Moscow's notorious Sailor's
Tranquility prison, Kozlenok claims that what he knows could bring
down some of Russia's leading politicians.
</P>
<P>
   And therefore, Kozlenok says, his own life is in danger _ a
claim that gained credibility after his business partner, Sergei
Dovbysh, mysteriously died in police custody in February.
</P>
<P>
   As Western countries consider a new $10 billion-$15 billion loan
to save Russia from its latest financial crisis, Kozlenok's story
should serve as a cautionary tale of what can happen to state funds
in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The sums involved in Kozlenok's case are relatively minor
compared to the billions in illegal earnings, unreported income and
misappropriated funds that have been spirited out of Russia since
1992.
</P>
<P>
   But Kozlenok's case is one of the most blatant examples of how
close connections to President Boris Yeltsin's government could
produce a fortune in the years of chaos, corruption and conspicuous
consumption that followed the Soviet collapse.
</P>
<P>
   It all began in 1992, when Kozlenok allegedly became acquainted
with Yevgeny Bychkov, who was head of the state committee in charge
of selling precious metals and gems from Russian mines.
</P>
<P>
   A company called Golden Ada was established in California, with
Kozlenok as the majority stockholder. The idea, according to
details of the case published in the Russian press, was for Russia
to export diamonds directly to the West, circumventing the
stranglehold held over Russian sales by De Beers, the South African
monopoly that controls the sale of diamonds worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Golden Ada begin receiving shipments of gems and gold.
In one case, $90 million in polished diamonds and tsarist coin
replicas were delivered to the company's San Francisco office. In
another, government officials signed a contract under which Golden
ADA was to process $88 million in rough diamonds.
</P>
<P>
   At least four ministers were allegedly involved, including
former Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, who plans to run for
president in 2000, and former Finance Minister Boris Fyodorov, whom
Yeltsin recently named Russia's chief tax inspector.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of returning the proceeds to the Russian government,
Kozlenok and his associates went on a buying spree: a San Francisco
office building, two Tiara yachts, a Gulfstream jet, a helicopter,
luxury cars and five Lake Tahoe condominiums.
</P>
<P>
   Kozlenok has maintained in interviews with the Russian press
that these purchases were necessary to project a ``solid financial
image.'' He has said that the terms of his deal with the Russian
government gave him until next year to return the money he owes.
</P>
<P>
   Russian authorities beg to differ. In 1996, when the Russian
government sensed something was wrong and sued to take over Golden
Ada's assets, only $50 million of the goods and money remained.
Kozlenok fled to Belgium, which has no extradition treaty with
Russia.
</P>
<P>
   But when Kozlenok recently went to Greece, he was arrested by
Greek authorities at Moscow's request. Last week, Greek officials
turned down his appeal and extradited him to Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Kozlenok says he was set up, and fears that he will be killed to
be kept from talking. Taking no chances, authorities provided
heavily-armed special forces troops and snipers to guard Kozlenok
at his arrival in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am being charged with something that I have basically never
done,'' he said in a recent interview in Izvestiya. Prosecutors
aren't buying. Last week, Ruslan Tumayev, the lead investigator of
the case, charged Kozlenok with fraud, illegal arms possesion,
forgery and violations of hard currency rules.
</P>
<P>
   But Valery Zhitov of the Russian Interior Ministry's Department
of Economic Crimes, said ``It is unlikely that Kozlenok was an
orphan acting alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the question is how far the scandal will go. Bychkov was
fired in 1995 and charged with abusing his position, but was later
pardoned.
</P>
<P>
   Both Chernomyrdin and Fyodorov appear in documents approving the
deals, authorities say. Both men deny wrongdoing, but Fyodorov has
been questioned and Chernomyrdin may soon be asked to give
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Kozlenok announced through his lawyer that he did not
plan to call any high-ranking officials as witnesses. Asked if
Kozlenok had made the statement to protect his own life, the
lawyer, Georgy Zuzulya, told NTV television: ``My client also asked
me to say that he has no intention of committing suicide, under any
circumstances.''

JONES' LAWYERS SAY HIGH COURT RULING WILL AID THEIR APPEAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Paula Jones' lawyers said Friday that the Supreme
Court's decision in favor of a Chicago businesswoman would help
them in their appeal to have Mrs. Jones' sexual harassment suit
against President Clinton reinstated.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're obviously very pleased,'' said Mrs. Jones' main lawyer,
Donovan Campbell of Dallas. His co-counsel, John Whitehead,
president of the Rutherford Institute, which is paying Mrs. Jones'
legal expenses, said the Supreme Court ruling improved the chances
that the Jones lawsuit would go to trial.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's lawyer, Robert Bennett, disagreed. The facts
in the case decided Friday ``are clearly distinguishable from the
Jones case,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In April, a federal judge dismissed Mrs. Jones' lawsuit. Her
lawyers obtained an extension of time in which to file their appeal
so they could see how the Supreme Court decided the businesswoman's
suit.
</P>
<P>
   The court ruled Friday that the woman, Kimberley Ellerth, could
claim sexual harassment after she was subjected to advances by a
superior, even though she had suffered no adverse consequences in
her job for rejecting him.
</P>
<P>
   One reason U.S. District Court Judge Susan Webber Wright
dismissed the suit against the president was that in her view Mrs.
Jones had failed to show any tangible detriment in her job.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Jones maintained that in 1991, when Clinton was governor of
Arkansas and she was a state employee, he called her to his hotel
room in Little Rock, where she rebuffed a crude sexual proposition.
Clinton has denied the assertion.
</P>
<P>
   In her case, Ms. Ellerth sued Burlington Industries, charging
that a vice president for whom she worked made frequent comments
about her legs, said he could make life at the office miserable for
her, asked her to have sex with him and said that he was reluctant
to promote her because she would not comply. She was promoted
nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Wright was aware of the Burlington case when she dismissed
the Jones suit and said that it was not relevant because Ms.
Ellerth had been threatened and Mrs. Jones had not.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell said he would file an appeal in the Jones case next
month. He said that he was especially heartened because the court
described the advances on Ms. Ellerth as ``boorish and offensive.''
Those are the words Judge Wright used to characterize what Mrs.
Jones claimed Clinton had done.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell said that he thought the court might be sending a
signal to the appeals court in the Jones case. &QL;

COURT'S HARASSMENT RULINGS PUT COMPANIES ON NOTICE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS BLACK  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court Friday put every company in
America on notice by ruling that an employer may be held liable
when a supervisor sexually harasses a worker, even if the
employee's job isn't harmed.
</P>
<P>
   The two 7-2 decisions that dramatically ended the court's term
could make it easier for employees to sue for sexual harassment,
but also provide employers with clear guidance on how to defend
themselves in such suits.
</P>
<P>
   The rulings also could help Paula Jones's appeal of her
sexual-harassment lawsuit against President Clinton. Jones's case
was dismissed April 1, when a federal judge ruled she did not
suffer any adverse consequences in her state job after she rebuffed
an alleged sexual advance from Clinton, then governor of Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   John Whitehead of the Rutherford Institute, the conservative
Virginia organization that provided legal assistance to Jones, said
Friday's decision ``greatly enhances the chances'' that an appeals
court would rule in Jones' favor.
</P>
<P>
   But Robert Bennett, Clinton's lawyer, said the facts were
radically different in the Jones case, and he predicted the high
court decisions would not ``undercut'' the judge's decision to
throw out her lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the decisions Friday, the Supreme Court ruled against
the city of Boca Raton, Fla., where two Parks Department
supervisors, Bill Terry and David Silverman, sexually harassed Beth
Ann Faragher when she was a city lifeguard. The court said the city
was liable for the supervisors' conduct because it did not take any
steps to prevent the harassment or monitor the conduct of the
supervisors.
</P>
<P>
   In the second case, the court ruled in favor of Kimberly Ellerth
of Chicago, a former Burlington Industries saleswoman who quit her
job because a supervisor repeatedly made sexually explicit remarks
to her. The court said Ellerth could sue the company even though
she did not suffer any adverse job consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Ellerth, like Faragher, did not bring a complaint while she
worked for the company and only mentioned the harassment after she
resigned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's rulings should be a wake-up call to employers to take
action to wipe out sexual harassment, and if they do, it will
benefit women and men alike,'' said Marcia D. Greenberger,
president of the National Women's Law Center.
</P>
<P>
   The decisions were also welcomed by the US Chamber of Commerce
because it helped clarify the responsibilities for employer and
employee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today the court has set a clear, bright-line standard for
establishing when an employer is or is not responsible for sexual
harassment in the work place,'' said Stephen A. Bokat, general
counsel for the chamber.
</P>
<P>
   Dissenting from the majority in both cases were Justices
Clarence Thomas, whose Senate confirmation became embroiled in
allegations that he sexually harassed Anita Hill, and Antonin
Scalia.
</P>
<P>
   ``An employer should be liable if, and only if, the plaintiff
proves that the employer was negligent in permitting the
supervisor's conduct to occur,'' Thomas wrote in the Burlington
case.
</P>
<P>
   ``A supervisor's creation of a hostile work environment is
neither within the scope of his employment, nor part of his
apparent authority,'' wrote Thomas. ``Indeed, a hostile work
environment is antithetical to the interest of the employer. In
such circumstances, an employer should be liable only if it has
been negligent.''
</P>
<P>
   The ruling in the Boca Raton case found that the city failed to
distribute its sexual-harassment policy to the beach employees and
made no attempt to keep track of the conduct of the supervisors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under such circumstances, we hold as a matter of law that the
city could not be found to have exercised reasonable care to
prevent the supervisors' harassing conduct,'' Justice David Souter
wrote in the majority opinion.
</P>
<P>
   An employer can be liable if it fails to take reasonable steps
to prevent sexual harassment in the work place, Souter said. The
court also found, however, that an employee has the responsibility
to take steps to report and stop the harassment if a complaint
procedure is in place.
</P>
<P>
   Joining Souter in the majority opinions were Justices William
Rehnquist, John Paul Stevens, Sandra Day O'Connor, Anthony Kennedy,
Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, writing the majority opinion in the Burlington case,
set a new two-part test for employers. A company can defend itself
if it shows it took ``reasonable care to prevent and correct
promptly any sexually harassing behavior'' and if the employee
neglected to take advantage of ``any preventive or corrective
opportunities provided by the employer'' such as a complaint
process.
</P>
<P>
   The decisions effectively say that an employee no longer needs
to show a ``quid pro quo'' to sue for sexual harassment. Under the
quid pro quo principle, an employee had to prove that refusing a
sexual advance from a boss cost the worker a raise or promotion or
had other negative consequences.
</P>
<P>
   The court underscored that to sue, the harassment needed to be
``extreme'' and not just a casual teasing comment. In addition, the
court said, a single instance would not necessarily qualify as a
hostile work environment.
</P>
<P>
   The two decisions were handed down four days after the Supreme
Court set a higher standard for sexual harassment in schools. In
Gebser v. Lago Vista, which was decided under a different federal
law, the court ruled that students who have been sexually harassed
must prove that school officials were both ignorant of, and
indifferent to, the harassment for the students to receive money
damages.
</P>
<P>
   Ann Reesman, general counsel of Equal Employment Advisory
Council, an association of 300 large private-sector companies,
called Friday's decisions ``a mixed bag for employers''.
</P>
<P>
   ``On balance, we are not unhappy with the outcome because it
could have been a lot worse. It is important that the court support
the employer who takes proactive efforts to prevent sexual
harassment, but we are disappointed that the court did not extend
that defense to all cases.''
</P>
<P>
   Carol M. Merchasin, a lawyer at Day, Berry &AMP; Howard in Boston
who trains managers and supervisors in sexual harassment, said the
court gave companies an opportunity to defend themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court has made it clear that if you are doing the right
thing, those things will be considered,'' she said in a telephone
interview. ``You are going to bear risk for your employees'
supervisors and managers conduct whether you knew what they did or
not.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the standard would have been far more difficult for
emplif the court had not indicated that a company can protect
itself from lawsuits by adopting sexual-harassment policies,
distributing those policies, and monitoring its supervisors'
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   The cases are Faragher v. City of Boca Raton, 97-282, and
Burlington Industries v. Ellerth 97-569.

 By ROY FURCHGOTT    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the Ladies Who Lunch at Bergdorf ask Claire Ramsey where
she found that f-a-a-a-a-bulous outfit, she knows that she's on to
a trend, and that she has just earned a few hundred bucks.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ramsey, 30, a New York University graduate student in public
health, works as a cafe hostess at Bergdorf Goodman in Manhattan.
But she is also a ``cool hunter'' _ a person whose taste is so
ahead of the curve that a trend analysis firm pays her a
$200-to-$500 bounty for helping to identify the Next Big Things to
sweep popular culture.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows how many cool hunters are prowling America's malls
and streets, but cool hunting is one of the latest trends in trend
analysis.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in the late 1960s, marketing research pioneers like
Yankelovich Partners and Roper Starch Worldwide measured opinion by
conducting scientific polls, following up with focus-group
research.
</P>
<P>
   Now firms like Iconoculture, Sputnik, Agent X, Lambesis and
Youth Intelligence, which employs Ms. Ramsey and nine other
part-time cool hunters aged 14 to 30, are incorporating cool
hunting, an anthropological field-study approach to trend spotting.
</P>
<P>
   The hunters prowl inner-city basketball courts, fashionable
nightclubs and houses in the Hamptons, observing the arbiters of
coolness whose tastes may eventually be adopted by the general
populace. (Hey, someone had to be the first to wear a baseball cap
backward.)
</P>
<P>
   These firms report to a corporate Who's Who that includes
Coca-Cola, MTV, General Mills and Wendy's International. The
companies, in turn, use the information to formulate new products
and to devise marketing campaigns that grab the attention of the
crucial youth market.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trendsetters are the ones breaking new ground in consumer
product areas, and they give you insights into what will be widely
developed down the road,'' said Janet Taylor, director of college
marketing for Sprint and a client of Youth Intelligence, a firm
based in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, when Youth Intelligence's analysis suggested
that tattoos would become popular, Sprint wound up luring students
to a calling-card promotion with marketing that included temporary
tattoos. Sprint declined to discuss exact figures for the campaign,
but said it had produced twice as many sign-ups as had been
expected.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Wicks, the director of the Sony design center in San
Francisco, said the company had made use of cool-hunter insights
when designing a new Walkman, the Freaq, for young athletic users.
</P>
<P>
   ``It uses special graphics, it uses special materials to hold it
to the body, and the Freaq logo is more prominent than the Sony
logo,'' Wicks said. ``It was using heavy-duty clips, much like
chains you see them wearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cool is the reason people buy things,'' he added. ``A shirt is
a shirt and it fulfills a function, but you buy the one with the
logo you think is cool.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as the qualities of cool are hard to pin down, so are the
criteria for becoming its hunter. The firms say their hunters have
a taste level that is avant-garde, but not so far out that it won't
become mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   Jane Rinzler Buckingham, the founder of Youth Intelligence, for
example, saw Ms. Ramsey in a cafe about four years ago wearing
Mhendi _ an intricate Indian henna-based skin decoration _ ahead of
the pack that would soon follow. Ms. Buckingham asked about the
Mhendi, and found Ms. Ramsey articulate about why she liked certain
items and fashions. And that was it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't just about her taste _ it was that she didn't care
about trends, yet naturally anticipated them,'' Ms. Buckingham
recalled.
</P>
<P>
   For Ms. Ramsey, the job isn't work. She and other hunters file
their reports informally, and not on a regular basis, though if
Youth Intelligence does not hear from a hunter it will call at
least three times a year.
</P>
<P>
   One of Ms. Ramsey's research methods is to be her own laboratory
rat. ``I can't necessarily afford the high-end fashion, so I make
my own things up,'' she said. If a particular item draws comments,
it may make her list.
</P>
<P>
   She also has a knack for spotting up-and-coming fashions on
others. Three years ago, she noticed an elderly woman wearing an
attractive ring. It was a Lalique ring, and Ms. Ramsey ran out and
bought one, reporting this to Youth Intelligence. ``Recently young
people started buying them,'' she said. ``There are all of these
plastic knockoffs of it.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Though being a cool hunter sounds, well, cool, trend analysis
companies consider the term derisive, applying it only to hired
hands like Ms. Ramsey. Cool hunting, the firms say, doesn't require
sophisticated analysis of why an item is cool, a service that the
research firms provide.
</P>
<P>
   One firm, Sputnik, refused to discuss the topic without a
guarantee that the words ``cool'' and ``hunter'' would not appear
in the article.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is a career track for former cool hunters.
</P>
<P>
   Tru Pettigrew, 30, started out surveying schoolyards for cool as
research for Converse, the sneaker company. But now, at Arnold
Communications, an advertising agency in Boston, he is the ``Voice
of the Consumer'' _ a broader job researching youth culture.
Between that position and his publication of Tru Flava, a quarterly
newsletter on youth trends, Pettigrew said he earns $40,000 to
$60,000 annually.
</P>
<P>
   Pettigrew plies his trade scouring schoolyards and clubs for new
cool _ he says, for instance, that clothes with big logos are old
news.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids are getting away from having a Hilfiger all across the
chest,'' he said. ``They want the smaller logo. They don't want to
look like they are trying too hard.''
</P>
<P>
   He also runs informal focus groups, taking products _ and,
sometimes, company executives _ out on the street for a sort of
urban cool safari. Pettigrew has a retinue of teachers and coaches
in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Baltimore, Houston, Chicago and
Boston who put him in contact with teen-agers. Though the young
people are seldom paid cash, they usually receive products, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Cool-industry specialties are popping up, too. For instance,
Richard Rushfield and Adam Leff founded Agent X, a cool-hunting
firm in Los Angeles that advises the entertainment industry
exclusively. ``We help them decide what movies to make because they
are working on projects for two and three years down the road,''
Rushfield said.
</P>
<P>
   Rushfield, a former political consultant, and Leff, who wrote
screenplays including ``The Last Action Hero,'' offer their clients
trend tours, showing studio executives what is hot. More often they
lecture, then field questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``They ask, `Will pirates be in?''' Rushfield said. The answer
is no _ witness 1995's epic pirate bomb, ``Cutthroat Island.''
</P>
<P>
   But Agent X gives a thumbs-up to upbeat road pictures and films
embracing ``traditional community values.'' Each genre, in its own
way, is an escape from complex moral choices, Rushfield said; road
movies are ``a subset of the trend toward a desire for fun removed
from a moral context,'' while traditional-value films appeal to
audiences ``looking to go back to simple, basic ways.''
</P>
<P>
   That means that future cinematic good guys are less likely to be
businessmen, who may be seen as morally tainted, than firefighters,
whose image remains largely uncorrupted, Rushfield said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Firemen represent simple, straightforward decency,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The pair work by traveling to big cities around the country,
using their radar to spot cool stuff. They compile much of it into
a one-page chart, called ``Intelligence Report,'' that runs
occasionally in Vanity Fair magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Now at work on a humorous how-to book on spotting trends, the
pair say their firm will bring in $1.2 million next year.
</P>
<P>
   Back in New York, Ms. Ramsey cannot claim such a hefty payday.
Still, she appreciates the money she does get.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pennies from heaven,'' she mused. ``I can rely that it's
there, but I can't rely when it's coming.'' &QL;

FOR LONG-DISTANCE DISCOUNTS, MORE NUMBERS TO DIAL  
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 28)
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By DEBRA WEST    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Long before the actor John Lithgow started urging people to save
on long-distance telephone calls by dialing 10-321, officials at
MCI Communications knew that the easy-to-remember code would soon
be complicated by a couple of extra digits.
</P>
<P>
   Before introducing the service in mid-1996, MCI executives had
to make a choice: they could either promote their ``dial-around''
service with the seven-digit code it would eventually have to
carry, or use a catchier five-digit number for as long as the
Federal Communications Commission allowed, then go through the
expense of re-educating customers when the change inevitably came.
</P>
<P>
   They took the latter path, investing nearly $79 million on the
10-321 ad campaign in 1997 and another $38 million in the first
quarter of this year to establish the service, according to
Competitive Media Reports, which tracks ad spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were less numbers and it was easier to remember,'' said
Brad Burns, a spokesman for MCI and Telecom USA, the subsidiary
that runs 10-321. ``This product lives on advertising. We wanted to
keep it in the top of the mind. Now, considering 10-321 has such
great brand awareness, we'll just roll it over.''
</P>
<P>
   Judgment day is nigh. As of Wednesday, customers of the service
will have to dial 10-10-321 to gain access to MCI's lines and
discounted long-distance rates.
</P>
<P>
   Though it declined to disclose how much the new campaign was
costing, MCI has been promoting the new number ferociously, with
direct mailings and new TV ads featuring Lithgow. Last Wednesday,
the service went so far as to offer one free 20-minute phone call
to anyone using the new number from 5 p.m. to midnight that night.
</P>
<P>
   ``There might be a little bit of a hiccup,'' Daniel E. Zito, a
telecommunications analyst at Legg Mason Wood Walker in Baltimore,
said of the short-term prospects for the new number. ``It will
require some consumer education. But I think it will still be
successful. It's a very mass-market way to tap into the casual
long-distance user.''
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of companies now operate dial-around telephone services,
which promise lower long-distance rates in return for dialing the
codes that direct the telephone network to connect the call to a
specific carrier. The size of the discount from dial-around
services is a matter of debate, since they usually compare their
lower rates with the highest nondiscounted residential rates
available.
</P>
<P>
   Many dial-around services will be making the adjustment to seven
digits _ a change intended in part to accommodate the growing
number of carriers. But because the MCI service, the most heavily
marketed, dominates the niche, it faces the most public
re-education campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``MCI, by putting all the dollars it has in, has made the whole
category float,'' said Amanda McCarthy, an analyst at the Yankee
Group, a telecommunications research firm in Boston. She said 9.4
percent of American households used a dial-around service in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McCarthy estimated that MCI controls more than 50 percent of
the dial-around segment, which had revenues of $1.5 billion in
1997. That figure could grow to $2 billion this year, in large part
because of MCI's push for its new number, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Dial-around numbers allow users to gain access to different
phone companies' lines, one call at a time, without making a
commitment to switch their long-distance carrier permanently.
</P>
<P>
   A subscriber to the AT&AMP;T long-distance service, for instance,
could dial 10-321 before making a call to route that call over
MCI's network. Similarly, an MCI customer could dial 10-288 (for
10-ATT) to route a call over AT&AMP;T's system.
</P>
<P>
   Why the change in the number? The first two digits in the code _
1 and 0 _ exist only to inform the telephone system that a
three-digit code identifying the desired carrier is about to
follow. That means that only 1,000 dial-around codes have been
available.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1989, telecommunications companies have known that the
supply of those three-digit numbers, called carrier identification
codes, would run out eventually. Indeed, the numbers, which are
also used by wireless carriers and large corporate accounts, were
exhausted in 1995.
</P>

   Industry executives and the FCC debated when to start requiring
the seven-digit numbers, which make about 10,000 codes available
for use. A transition period began in 1995, with carriers having
the option of using their five-digit numbers or switching to seven.
</P>
<P>
   Last October _ a month before MCI expanded 10-321 from 19 test
markets into a national service _ the FCC set July 1 as the
mandatory changeover date. Kris Monteith, a senior lawyer for the
FCC, says the seven-digit rule is intended to give all the
competitors a level playing field.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew this was coming,'' said Burns of MCI. ``It was a
business decision to wait. We think customers will adjust to the
change.''

CLINTON'S STANCE ON CHINA SHOWS DRAMATIC SHIFT DURING PAST SIX
YEARS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (For release Sunday, June 28) 
 
By CRAGG HINES 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ As votes in the U.S. presidential election were
tallied six years ago, hundreds of diplomats and academics crowded
into a hotel ballroom for an American Embassy party to watch Bill
Clinton march to victory and ponder the meaning for U.S.-China
relations.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. envoy recalls being told by a Chinese official, ``My
government knows that pre-election rhetoric may not have much to do
with future policy.''
</P>
<P>
   What a prescient observation. Because on few, if any, major
issues have Clinton's actions in office regarding China been more
divergent from his campaign oratory.
</P>
<P>
   Candidate Clinton's rhetorical brimstone regarding China has
been replaced by President Clinton's policy of friendly
accommodation.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's pledges to exact radically different behavior from
Beijing in return for engagement with Washington were dropped
within weeks of his taking office, and any questions about
inconsistency have been brushed aside as unsophisticated.
</P>
<P>
   Repeatedly during the 1992 campaign, Clinton, then the governor
of Arkansas and lacking much foreign policy experience, sought to
show he would stand up to China. Clinton berated President Bush for
continuing to engage the Communist nation in the wake of the
slaughter of hundreds of pro-democracy demonstrators at Tiananmen
Square in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   In an Aug. 13, 1992, speech to the Los Angeles World Affairs
Council, Clinton laid out his concern:
</P>
<P>
   ``When China cracked down on pro-democracy demonstrators,
exported advance weapons to radical regimes and suppressed Tibet,
this (Bush) administration and this president failed to stand up
for our values. Instead, he sent secret emissaries to China,
signaling we would do business as usual with those who murdered
freedom in Tiananmen Square.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has not sent secret emissaries, he has come himself, and
was welcomed at an official ceremony Saturday on Tiananmen Square
as part of the first visit of an American head of state since the
massacre.
</P>
<P>
   He is in the midst of a nine-day visit to China, where the
government still strictly limits the right of political dissent,
sought as recently as this year to export chemical weapons to Iran
and rides herd on religious expression, including severe strictures
in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton contends that China, with its authoritarian view of
human rights, remains ``on the wrong side of history'' but argues
that his ``principled and pragmatic'' plan for engaging the regime
in Beijing makes sense.
</P>
<P>
   That was essentially the same argument advanced by President
Bush in 1992 but denounced by candidate Clinton, who promised in
his speech accepting the Democratic nomination an America ``that
will not coddle tyrants, from Baghdad to Beijing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Six years have transpired since that statement,'' said
Clinton's national security adviser, Samuel ``Sandy'' Berger.
``Things have changed in China, I think, to some degree. I think we
are no less assiduous or vigorous in promoting human rights today
than the president's advocacy earlier.''
</P>
<P>
   Berger, who before joining the Clinton administration had
lobbied as a lawyer against granting China most-favored-nation
trade status, now argues that ``essentially threatening to sever
our economic relationship was no leverage on human rights.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of Clinton's severest criticism on China comes from
Democrats in Congress, including Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., who
said the president has not only ``flip-flopped'' but also
``reneged'' on campaign promises to get tough with Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's personal campaign manifesto, ``Putting People First,''
spelled out how he would deal commercially with nondemocratic
governments:
</P>
<P>
   ``We will condition favorable trade terms with repressive
regimes _ such as China's communist regime _ on respect for human
rights, political liberalization and responsible international
conduct.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1992 Democratic platform echoed the sentiment, promising
that ``favorable trade terms for China'' depended on ``respect for
human rights in China and Tibet, greater access for U.S. goods and
responsible conduct on weapons proliferation.''
</P>
<P>
   Less than four months after entering the White House, Clinton
proposed an extension of China's MFN status, which was accepted by
Congress. The next year, in 1994, Clinton formally dropped any
linkage between China's human rights record and trade policy.
</P>
<P>
   China has taken full advantage of the commercial ties, and the
U.S. trade deficit with Beijing during Clinton's tenure has
totaled, through fiscal 1997, $175 billion. An estimated $57
billion will be added to that in the fiscal year that ends Sept.
30. The biggest U.S. export to China, according to the Commerce
Department, is airplanes and parts; China's biggest export to the
United States is toys and shoes.
</P>
<P>
   The week after Clinton's convention speech, and its denunciation
of the ``tyrants'' in Beijing, Richard Holbrooke was in the Chinese
capital. Holbrooke, long a Democratic foreign policy mandarin, was
then a former assistant secretary of state in the Carter
administration and is now Clinton's nominee to be ambassador to the
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke told the Los Angeles Times that he was in Beijing on
behalf of Lehman Brothers, the investment banking firm with which
he has been associated when not in government.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke said he met with Chinese leaders _ including the still
powerful Zhu Rongji, who is now premier _ but denied as ``totally
false'' allegations of Chinese dissidents that he had told the
officials to discount Clinton's campaign rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   Whether he did or not, it would have been sage advice.

COURT'S HARASSMENT RULINGS PUT COMPANIES ON NOTICE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS BLACK  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court Friday put every company in
America on notice by ruling that an employer may be held liable
when a supervisor sexually harasses a worker, even if the
employee's job isn't harmed.
</P>
<P>
   The two 7-2 decisions that dramatically ended the court's term
could make it easier for employees to sue for sexual harassment,
but also provide employers with clear guidance on how to defend
themselves in such suits.
</P>
<P>
   The rulings also could help Paula Jones's appeal of her
sexual-harassment lawsuit against President Clinton. Jones's case
was dismissed April 1, when a federal judge ruled she did not
suffer any adverse consequences in her state job after she rebuffed
an alleged sexual advance from Clinton, then governor of Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   John Whitehead of the Rutherford Institute, the conservative
Virginia organization that provided legal assistance to Jones, said
Friday's decision ``greatly enhances the chances'' that an appeals
court would rule in Jones' favor.
</P>
<P>
   But Robert Bennett, Clinton's lawyer, said the facts were
radically different in the Jones case, and he predicted the high
court decisions would not ``undercut'' the judge's decision to
throw out her lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the decisions Friday, the Supreme Court ruled against
the city of Boca Raton, Fla., where two Parks Department
supervisors, Bill Terry and David Silverman, sexually harassed Beth
Ann Faragher when she was a city lifeguard. The court said the city
was liable for the supervisors' conduct because it did not take any
steps to prevent the harassment or monitor the conduct of the
supervisors.
</P>
<P>
   In the second case, the court ruled in favor of Kimberly Ellerth
of Chicago, a former Burlington Industries saleswoman who quit her
job because a supervisor repeatedly made sexually explicit remarks
to her. The court said Ellerth could sue the company even though
she did not suffer any adverse job consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Ellerth, like Faragher, did not bring a complaint while she
worked for the company and only mentioned the harassment after she
resigned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's rulings should be a wake-up call to employers to take
action to wipe out sexual harassment, and if they do, it will
benefit women and men alike,'' said Marcia D. Greenberger,
president of the National Women's Law Center.
</P>
<P>
   The decisions were also welcomed by the US Chamber of Commerce
because it helped clarify the responsibilities for employer and
employee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today the court has set a clear, bright-line standard for
establishing when an employer is or is not responsible for sexual
harassment in the work place,'' said Stephen A. Bokat, general
counsel for the chamber.
</P>
<P>
   Dissenting from the majority in both cases were Justices
Clarence Thomas, whose Senate confirmation became embroiled in
allegations that he sexually harassed Anita Hill, and Antonin
Scalia.
</P>
<P>
   ``An employer should be liable if, and only if, the plaintiff
proves that the employer was negligent in permitting the
supervisor's conduct to occur,'' Thomas wrote in the Burlington
case.
</P>
<P>
   ``A supervisor's creation of a hostile work environment is
neither within the scope of his employment, nor part of his
apparent authority,'' wrote Thomas. ``Indeed, a hostile work
environment is antithetical to the interest of the employer. In
such circumstances, an employer should be liable only if it has
been negligent.''
</P>
<P>
   The ruling in the Boca Raton case found that the city failed to
distribute its sexual-harassment policy to the beach employees and
made no attempt to keep track of the conduct of the supervisors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under such circumstances, we hold as a matter of law that the
city could not be found to have exercised reasonable care to
prevent the supervisors' harassing conduct,'' Justice David Souter
wrote in the majority opinion.
</P>
<P>
   An employer can be liable if it fails to take reasonable steps
to prevent sexual harassment in the work place, Souter said. The
court also found, however, that an employee has the responsibility
to take steps to report and stop the harassment if a complaint
procedure is in place.
</P>
<P>
   Joining Souter in the majority opinions were Justices William
Rehnquist, John Paul Stevens, Sandra Day O'Connor, Anthony Kennedy,
Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, writing the majority opinion in the Burlington case,
set a new two-part test for employers. A company can defend itself
if it shows it took ``reasonable care to prevent and correct
promptly any sexually harassing behavior'' and if the employee
neglected to take advantage of ``any preventive or corrective
opportunities provided by the employer'' such as a complaint
process.
</P>
<P>
   The decisions effectively say that an employee no longer needs
to show a ``quid pro quo'' to sue for sexual harassment. Under the
quid pro quo principle, an employee had to prove that refusing a
sexual advance from a boss cost the worker a raise or promotion or
had other negative consequences.
</P>
<P>
   The court underscored that to sue, the harassment needed to be
``extreme'' and not just a casual teasing comment. In addition, the
court said, a single instance would not necessarily qualify as a
hostile work environment.
</P>
<P>
   The two decisions were handed down four days after the Supreme
Court set a higher standard for sexual harassment in schools. In
Gebser v. Lago Vista, which was decided under a different federal
law, the court ruled that students who have been sexually harassed
must prove that school officials were both ignorant of, and
indifferent to, the harassment for the students to receive money
damages.
</P>
<P>
   Ann Reesman, general counsel of Equal Employment Advisory
Council, an association of 300 large private-sector companies,
called Friday's decisions ``a mixed bag for employers''.
</P>
<P>
   ``On balance, we are not unhappy with the outcome because it
could have been a lot worse. It is important that the court support
the employer who takes proactive efforts to prevent sexual
harassment, but we are disappointed that the court did not extend
that defense to all cases.''
</P>
<P>
   Carol M. Merchasin, a lawyer at Day, Berry &AMP; Howard in Boston
who trains managers and supervisors in sexual harassment, said the
court gave companies an opportunity to defend themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court has made it clear that if you are doing the right
thing, those things will be considered,'' she said in a telephone
interview. ``You are going to bear risk for your employees'
supervisors and managers conduct whether you knew what they did or
not.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the standard would have been far more difficult for
emplif the court had not indicated that a company can protect
itself from lawsuits by adopting sexual-harassment policies,
distributing those policies, and monitoring its supervisors'
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   The cases are Faragher v. City of Boca Raton, 97-282, and
Burlington Industries v. Ellerth 97-569.

DNC CHIEF WON'T AID BOSTON'S EFFORT TO NET 2000 CONVENTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANTHONY FLINT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Democratic National Committee chairman and
Massachusetts native Steve Grossman, who has the clout to steer the
Democratic convention to Boston, said Friday he's going to stay
neutral on the choice of a host city and will abide by the
recommendations of the party's site selection committee.
</P>
<P>
   Grossman, who was in town Friday for a meeting of the state
party chairmen, said in an interview that the ``door is wide open
for Boston'' and that this week's site visit by the selection
committee ``could not have been more successful.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said he won't intervene to make sure the convention goes
to his home state, as the late Ron Brown did as DNC chair in 1992
when he insisted the event be held in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``The credibility of the process is very important to me,''
Grossman said before addressing the gathering of state party
chairs. ``I would find it overwhelmingly difficult to override the
site selection committee ... I have to be objective.''
</P>
<P>
   Both city officials, who have been making a strong pitch to have
the convention at the FleetCenter, and Democratic party observers
said Grossman has to respect the process publicly even if he pushes
for Boston privately. But some say it is genuinely Grossman's style
not to ``wire'' the convention for Boston in any way, in contrast
to Brown, who was outspoken about having the convention in New York
through the entire site selection process in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fiddling with the process might run counter to what his tenure
has been about, involving all 50 states'' in party decisions, said
Ernest J. Corrigan, spokesman for the Massachusetts Democratic
State Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Grossman's reluctance to intervene is disappointing news for
city officials, however. The conventional wisdom after this week's
visit to Boston by the site selection committee was that the city
showed it could handle the convention both in terms of logistics
and image.
</P>
<P>
   There was also much talk by committee members that Vice
President Al Gore, at this point the likely presidential nominee in
2000, was genuinely not swayed by arguments that the convention
should be held in Los Angeles or Philadelphia, for their larger
media markets and electoral-vote quarry.
</P>
<P>
   All those factors being relatively equal, Boston boosters had
hoped Grossman could step in and push the city over the top.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Leibowitz, director of the city's intergovernmental
affairs office and a leader in the convention bid, said the
important thing was that Boston established itself as a viable
candidate this week. Site selection committee members gave rave
reviews to the FleetCenter and the job Mayor Thomas M. Menino did
showing off the city _ including soothing concerns about traffic
and construction associated with the Big Dig.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've proven this week that we can host the convention and do
an excellent job with it. Whether we will depends on political
factors, some of which are beyond our control,'' Leibowitz said.
``But let there be no doubt, we can produce a first-rate
convention. Our challenge was to prove that part of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   And there will be no shortage of homegrown political influence
in the party despite Grossman's vow to stay objective. State party
chair Joan Menard was elected president of the Association of State
Democratic Chairs Friday, and Menard is also on the site selection
committee.
</P>
<P>
   The site selection committee begins its tour of Philadelphia on
Tuesday.

GRAF OUSTED BY ZVEREVA; DAVENPORT ADVANCES
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By ROBIN FINN     
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WIMBLEDON, England _ Her racquet hand turned limp as a noodle,
her serve had no sting and the forehand she has always depended on
to scare her challengers half silly went totally missing. Although
it was cold and wet enough Friday to make her teeth chatter, panic
had already set in and had the same effect.
</P>
<P>
   Steffi Graf, who has made a career of being an Iron Maiden on
these lawns, was quaking. And across the net, the mercurial Natasha
Zvereva seemed to have morphed Graf's legendary willpower and made
it her own.
</P>
<P>
   This was a double aberration. The fourth-seeded Graf, seven
times a Wimbledon champion and 17 times the victor against Zvereva,
had an attack of stage fright this gloomy Friday and could not
recover. And Zvereva, five times a Wimbledon doubles champion but
never again a Grand Slam singles finalist after Graf's pitiless
6-0, 6-0 annihilation of her in their 1988 French Open finale, kept
her own composure from start to finish.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-4, 7-5 victory for the 27-year-old Zvereva forwarded the
pigtailed doubles specialist into the Round of 16 and stranded the
29-year-old Graf on the sideline. The German has been able to play
just four tournaments since undergoing career-threatening knee
surgery a year ago, and she had gone through feverish training and
rehabilitation just to get herself fit for her favorite slam. The
early-round setback put her back in a familiar spot: out of
commission.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the 22nd-ranked Zvereva, who replaces Graf as a
potential quarterfinal opponent for sixth-seeded Monica Seles,
second-seeded Lindsay Davenport, Zvereva's occasional doubles
partner, reached the fourth round with a 6-3, 1-6, 6-2 defeat of
Venezuela's Maria Alejandra Vento.
</P>
<P>
   On the men's side, where the constant interruptions of rain
delayed the completion of the second round until Friday,
sixth-seeded Patrick Rafter, the U.S. Open champion, became the
first man to reach the Round of 16. Rafter, of Australia, advanced
with a 6-3, 6-7 (7-9), 6-2, 6-1 dismissal of Sweden's Magnus
Gustafsson.
</P>
<P>
   And 14th-seeded Goran Ivanisevic of Croatia, like Rafter a
serve-and-volleyer hoping to redeem himself here after a horrible
first half of 1998, finally finished his second-rounder against
Andrei Medvedev with 26 aces and a last set flourish.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I play like this, anything is possible, but I have to play
five more rounds at least to do something,'' Ivanisevic said after
his 6-3, 7-6 (7-4), 4-6, 6-0 victory. ``You know, it's been my
worst six months ever in my career, but that's passed. The last
time I felt this good was maybe '94 when I played the final here.''
</P>
<P>
   The last time Graf felt this paralyzed was last week at
Eastbourne when, struck by a similar onset of anxiety, she was
ousted in the quarterfinals by 17-year-old Anna Kournikova.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've played so little that for some reason I can't find the
confidence playing out there,'' said the red-eyed Graf, who seemed
resigned to her present inconsistency until the future brings more
matches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started playing nervously in the beginning, the return of
serve was terrible, and every time it was important, I didn't play
the points very well at all.'' Graf's conversion rate on her paltry
trio of break opportunities was a thoroughly uncharacteristic zero.
</P>
<P>
   ``My problem is pretty clear,'' Graf said. ``It's lack of match
practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Too, Graf's problem Friday was Zvereva, a sporadically brilliant
shotmaker who chose Friday to play the match of her life. Zvereva
broke Graf with a backhand that skittered off the sideline in the
opening game and held fast to her momentum until Graf's last
mistake, a netted backhand return, validated the upset.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's by far the best match of my life; I was mentally
tough on every point, and I don't think that ever happened
before,'' said Zvereva, whose coup received special attention not
just from Graf, but from a locker room full of astonished
co-workers.
</P>
<P>
   Zvereva, a confirmed goofball, said her colleagues reacted to
her victory with hilarity and asked her if her unnatural powers of
concentration during the match were an indication that she was ill
or, possibly, lobotomized. ``But I can take some jokes.''
</P>
<P>
   And Graf, rarely a communicative loser, acknowledged Zvereva's
table-turning victory with an actual concession speech when the two
shook hands at the net. ``She said,'' Zvereva reported, `` `By the
way, very nice match,' which coming from her to me right after the
match was very important.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plus she looked me in the eyes,'' said Zvereva who hadn't ever
received such intimate treatment, or such glowing praise, from Graf
since that initial 12-game French Open final 10 years ago. ``That
meant a lot to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Zvereva, a Minsk, Belarus, native who spends ample time in her
adopted beach haunts in southern California, said she had not gone
into the match particularly confident as she waited for the Center
Court tarpaulins to be removed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm never confident against top people, especially certain
people like Steffi, or hard-hitting people, because my game doesn't
really match up,'' said Zvereva, whose career-best showing in the
singles rankings was No. 5 in 1989. ``I don't move that great, so
it's hard to get to the ball. But today I think I was in a kind of
mechanical mood, just try to get the ball over the net, and hit as
much as possible to the backhand.'' &QL;

   BEIJING _ Tiananmen Square is the symbolic center of Communist
China.
</P>
<P>
   It is where Mao Tse-tung proclaimed the founding of the People's
Republic in 1949, where millions of Red Guards gathered in the
political frenzy of the 1960s, and where students spontaneously
convened the largest demonstrations in the nation's history to
demand greater democracy during the spring of 1989.
</P>
<P>
   But to most of the outside world, ``Tiananmen'' is still
synonymous with the massacre that occurred in Beijing on June 4,
1989.
</P>
<P>
   As President Clinton attends a formal welcoming ceremony in the
square on Saturday morning, simply setting foot here offers fuel to
critics of his China policy, who argue that he is sending the wrong
message about human rights or is insulting the memory of hundreds
of unarmed civilians who were killed near the square by the
People's Liberation Army in the crackdown.
</P>
<P>
   Sensitive to this concern, arrangements by the White House and
the Chinese government call for the ceremony to be positioned so
that the square will not appear in photographs, The Associated
Press reported.
</P>
<P>
   Yet from the moment he agreed to come to China at all, Clinton
was effectively required to appear at the welcoming ceremony in
Tiananmen Square. It was not negotiable. American officials did not
even try to engage the Chinese on that point, one official said,
because the Chinese would not seriously discuss it.
</P>
<P>
   Because the ceremony is held in front of the Great Hall of the
People, in an oblong plaza at one side of the square, American
officials have tried to argue that Clinton will not actually stand
in Tiananmen Square itself. That is sort of like saying that
standing at the corner of 43rd St. and Seventh Avenue in Manhattan
is not being in Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   A favorite image from 1989, of a lone young man standing down a
tank, is commonly believed to have occurred in Tiananmen Square,
though it actually happened on the Avenue of Eternal Peace,
slightly to the east of the Square's entrance. (He has never been
identified.)
</P>
<P>
   Tiananmen is known as the site of the massacre, but was actually
the site only of protests.
</P>
<P>
   The sequence of events, in essence, was this: After seven weeks
of demonstrations only a few thousand hard-core, student-led
activists were left in the square by the night of June 3, when the
Communist Party decided to send in the army to clear the protesters
away.
</P>
<P>
   A few dozen policemen might have done that job, since by then
most demonstrators had gotten bored and gone home. But after a
wrenching power struggle at the top of the party _ party chief Zhao
Ziyang had been purged _ Deng Xiaoping apparently thought it
necessary to show the nation that the leadership was finally
united.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of armed soldiers approached Tiananmen Square in tanks
and open-back trucks from the east, north and west, but for a
reason that still remains unclear, only those coming from the west
opened fire. Shortly before midnight, soldiers about three miles
west of the square began indiscriminately shooting at unarmed
civilians in the street.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the first troops reached the edge of the square and
stopped shooting, at roughly 2 a.m., the students huddled around
the Monument to the People's Heroes at the square's center were
terrified. Four intellectuals siding with the students were able to
negotiate with an army commander to let the students leave
peacefully, and, after a voice vote seemed to approve that
decision, they filed out of the southwest corner.
</P>
<P>
   It is now considered unlikely that anyone was actually killed in
Tiananmen Square itself. But the army sealed it off, and with the
government in crisis mode, people on the streets of Beijing spread
their impression _ inaccurate but fully understandable, under the
circumstances _ that Tiananmen Square had been washed in the blood
of thousands of innocent students.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the killings _ hundreds, probably _ had occurred almost
exclusively on Changan Dajie _ the Avenue of Eternal Peace. And
though sporadic killings occurred just outside the square for the
next two days, when the authorities later assembled their
Orwellian-sounding defense of the massacre, they latched onto the
fact _ perhaps true, but clearly beside the point _ that no one had
died on the square.
</P>
<P>
   To this day, the authorities have never revealed how many people
were shot and killed that night.

EARLY RETURNS SHOW NEW ULSTER ASSEMBLY OPPOSITION OUTNUMBERED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST -- Preliminary results and projections by the BBC show
that more than 70 percent of the members of the 108-seat Northern
Ireland Assembly will be made up of members who have vowed to make
the new legislature work.
</P>
<P>
   Dissident unionists who want to obstruct its operation will fall
short of the seats needed to block progress, initial returns
showed. But they did better than expected and could cause problems
for Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble, who will probably be
elected first minister of the assembly at its inaugural sitting
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   According to the early results, Catholic nationalists made a
strong start, while a rift was opening among Protestant unionists.
The vote count, complicated by the proportional representation
system which allows voters to transfer votes to other candidates in
order of preference, was expected to continue today.
</P>
<P>
   Projections show that candidates who oppose the Good Friday
agreement that created the assembly will get nearly the 30 seats
needed to force any measure passed by the assembly to have majority
support from both nationalist and unionist members. But they are
expected to fall well short of the 36 seats needed to block
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   But there appear to be deep divisions within the Protestant
unionist community, which wants to remain part of the United
Kingdom, and strong showings by the two main nationalist parties,
which aspire to unity with the Irish Republic.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in Northern Ireland's 77-year history, a
nationalist organization, the Social Democratic and Labor Party
(SDLP), received the largest number of first preference votes in an
election. But under the proportional representation system, the
largest unionist party, the Ulster Unionists, will gain many
transfer votes and are projected to win 29 seats.
</P>
<P>
   Projections by the BBC suggested the SDLP would win 25 seats,
while other pro-agreement parties are expected to win the
following: Sinn Fein, 17 seats; Alliance, 6 seats; Progressive
Unionists, 3.
</P>
<P>
   Of the anti-agreement parties who have made veiled threats to
make the assembly unworkable, the Democratic Unionists are
projected to take 21 seats and the United Kingdom Unionists five
seats. There are several Ulster Unionist dissidents who are also
expected to win seats.
</P>
<P>
   Dissidents within Trimble's party and its chief rival, the
Democratic Unionists, did better than expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll make a lot of noise, but the wreckers will not have
enough seats to wreck it,'' said Alliance leader John Alderdice.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble acknowledged that the early results and the forecasts
are ``not as decisive as we would have liked.'' But he said there
will be a majority within the unionist community to make the
assembly work.
</P>
<P>
   While the unionist vote was fractured, the Irish nationalist
vote was higher than expected. Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams, the
first member of the assembly elected, said his party's vote was up
2 percent. That is important to show dubious members of the Irish
Republican Army that its leadership's decision to let politics take
precedence will pay dividends.
</P>
<P>
   With its projected vote, Sinn Fein, which has close links to the
IRA, will probably get two seats in the 12-member shadow cabinet
that will steer the assembly until it gets running next fall.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of Sinn Fein sitting in the cabinet before the IRA
disarms will be the first dispute of many in the new assembly.
Dissident unionists refuse to sit in the assembly with republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The turnout of 68 percent was well down from the record 81
percent who voted in last month's referendum which approved the
Good Friday agreement which calls for power sharing and
cross-border cooperation.

CBS TO SELL WESTINGHOUSE NUCLEAR UNIT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., Idaho, Britain)  (bl) 
 By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CBS Corp. will sell its Westinghouse nuclear and government
services operation to a joint venture formed by Morrison Knudsen
Corp. and a British nuclear-fuel processor, the companies said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   For CBS, which changed its name from Westinghouse Electric Corp.
in December, the sale rids the company of the last vestige of its
industrial past.
</P>
<P>
   For Morrison Knudsen, a $1.7 billion construction and
engineering company based in Boise, Idaho, that came near to
bankruptcy because of severe debt earlier this decade, the deal is
a way to increase its nuclear business quickly.
</P>
<P>
   For Westinghouse, it means a final end to speculation about its
future. ``We've worked under a lot of uncertainty in the last few
months, and we are really glad it's over,'' said Charles Pryor Jr.,
who will remain Westinghouse president.
</P>
<P>
   So is CBS management. Until last fall, CBS had said that it
would spin its industrial businesses off to shareholders. Analysts
had projected that even in a booming market, the entire group,
which included conventional power systems and process controls,
would garner no more than $3 a share; at an anticipated 700 million
shares, that would have brought no more than $2.1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement announced Friday, Morrison Knudsen and
British Nuclear Fuels Ltd. will pay $238 million in cash and assume
$950 million in liabilities and other obligations of the nuclear
operations.
</P>
<P>
   CBS spokesman Jack Bergen said the money would probably be used
to buy back stock and to acquire more radio and outdoor media
companies like Transportation Displays Inc., its bus-stop
advertising company.
</P>
<P>
   The joint venture will retain the Westinghouse Electric Co. name
and will remain in Monroeville, Pa. Morrison Knudsen is providing
$168 million of the $238 million in cash, but will assume only $30
million of the $950 million in liabilities. Still, it will get 60
percent of the equity in the company.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   That structure may go a long way toward getting the deal
approved by the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are concerned about foreign countries having influence
on the nuclear industry, and Morrison Knudsen probably had to be in
control for this deal to fly here,'' said George Davies, an analyst
with ADDco Investment Research who also owns Morrison Knudsen
stock.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, that was the trump card that some American bidders for
the company hoped they held. ``This is an important strategic
business, and it would be better if it had remained under 100
percent U.S. ownership,'' said Linden Blue, vice chairman of
General Atomics, a San Diego technology company that had bid for
Westinghouse.
</P>
<P>
   William Wicker, a spokesman for the Energy Department, said,
``We provided CBS with our assessment on the impact a sale might
have on security, and they indicated willingness to address our
concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   British Nuclear Fuels, a $2.5 billion company whose stock is
owned by the British government, is no stranger to U.S. projects.
Its U.S. subsidiary, BNFL Inc., operates cleanup and
decommissioning contracts at five Energy Department sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have unique security relationships with the United States
government,'' said BNFL president Thomas Crimmins.
</P>
<P>
   Nor are the companies strangers to each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our ability to work together is proven,'' said Dennis
Washington, Morrison Knudsen's chairman and largest shareholder,
adding that his company and BNFL were already teamed up on a
project to clean up the Energy Department's Rocky Flats plant near
Denver and that Morrison Knudsen and Westinghouse had worked
together on projects at the department's Savannah River plant. &QL;

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Do teachers, minorities carry political clout
ascribed to them?
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Unreported, when Bill Archer said the words, was whether his lip
quivered.
</P>
<P>
   Quivered when he said the words ``intense lobbying from special
interests,'' that is.
</P>
<P>
   Surely the Republican congressman is steeled when the subject is
``intense lobbying from special interests.'' Heaven knows Capitol
Hill Republicans try to insulate themselves. And when the going
gets too rough for a congressman besieged by special interests, the
tobacco industry can always supply a condo and a jet to get away.
</P>
<P>
   To what ``special interests'' was Archer referring the other day
in defending a piece of legislation that, true to the forces that
insulate him and his cohorts, would be a boon to the condo-jet
getaway set? It appears the villainous foes would be: school
teachers.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is tax-free savings accounts that were created last
year to help families save for college. This week the House and
Senate voted to make them apply also to elementary and secondary
school.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton threatens a veto, for good reason. A Treasury
Department analysis found that 70 percent of the benefits would go
to the top 20 percent of income earners. That's up to $2,000 a year
sheltered from the tax man.
</P>
<P>
   That's just what this country needs _ another tax break to make
the wealthy wealthier.
</P>
<P>
   But opponents like teachers associations know that there's more
to this seemingly benign notion. It fits into the never-ending
effort to undermine public schools by siphoning tax dollars to
private schools, with vouchers as the endgame.
</P>
<P>
   Powerful groups?
</P>
<P>
   What one should find humorous in Archer's mock fright about
``special interests'' is that, as is so often the case, folks of
his ilk feign fear about groups of people whose power is generally
marginal, in this case teachers associations, when compared with
the real big-money interests.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, any union has power. That's the design of a union. But
the constant harping against the influence and designs of teachers
unions would make one think they're on a political par with the
Pentagon and Big Oil.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians on either side of the aisle know how to play the
special-interest game, whether it be to strum to the tune of big
labor or to invite industry to sit in at the table as environmental
regulations get sliced and diced.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the current majority party in Congress can stretch
credulity when it talks about some of the ``special interests''
that supposedly carry so much power.
</P>
<P>
   Most comical is the tremble that consumes those who inveigh
against the powerful ``gay lobby.'' Here is a shadow population of
people, most of whom dare not admit what they are. The fact that
some activists know how to punch a fax machine, however, makes them
the powerful gay lobby.
</P>
<P>
   As evidence of its power, note the tremblers, an openly gay man
is nominated to become ambassador to Luxembourg. Egads.
</P>
<P>
   Tomorrow, the world
</P>
<P>
   And we know full well that after the gay lobby gets Luxembourg
it would demand Andorra.
</P>
<P>
   The other ``special interest'' that gets the tremblers trembling
is minority groups, whose power is so fulsome among all that
Washington starch. Why, just look at all those black and brown
powerbrokers in Congress, in board rooms, and on the Forbes
billionnaire registry. What a mighty force.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the tremblers have us convinced that through affirmative
action, minorities will have us all under their powerful thumbs.
</P>
<P>
   If you're white and very wealthy, goes the warning, be prepared
to become a stain on the sidewalk.
</P>
<P>
   It's a good thing there's always someone to turn to, some
champion of the underdog, say, Big Tobacco, to which a congressman
can phone in his getaway reservations.

A WARMING TREND FOR CANADIAN STOCKS? 
</HEADLINE>
  (ART ADV: Graphic showing top 5 Canadian companies by rate of
return will be sent to NYT graphic clients. Non-subscribers can
make individual purchase by calling 212-556-4204 or 1927.) 
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 28) 
(af) 
 By SANA SIWOLOP    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Start with a strong, rebounding economy. Add an apparently
undervalued stock market. Throw in a national currency that seems
to have been pummeled by one Arctic blast after another.
</P>
<P>
   To many investors, that sounds like a recipe for bargains. And
it explains why some are hungrily watching the Canadian stock
market.
</P>
<P>
   The mere mention of Canada, though, can stop some otherwise
eager American investors cold. Over the years the nation to the
north has produced enough seedy mining companies and dubious oil
stocks to fill the St. Lawrence Seaway. Its smaller stock exchanges
have reputations for lax regulation and even slacker enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   And deep frustration can await an investor who tries to get the
same kind of detailed information about a Canadian company that is
readily available about companies whose stocks are traded in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   But many analysts see in Canada something hard to find in the
United States: plenty of upside potential.
</P>
<P>
   Canada's domestic economy could hardly look more promising.
Growth is strong, inflation is low and upward pressure on wages is
almost nonexistent. And the weakness of the Canadian dollar, which
reached an all-time low in mid-June and was worth about 68 American
cents on Friday, is bolstering the country's exports. They will
soon account for half the country's total output.
</P>
<P>
   Still, valuations of Canadian stocks have lately lagged behind
those of their American cousins. According to Fred Sturm, portfolio
manager of the Ivy Canada mutual fund, business prospects for
companies in sectors other than natural resources, Canada's
traditional strength, are still attractive, but their stocks are
currently trading at levels 10 percent to 20 percent below those of
their south-of-the-border counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   And because Canada's commodities businesses depend heavily on
exports, now depressed by the disruptions in Asian economies,
Canadian natural-resource stocks are even cheaper, trading at
discounts of 20 percent to 30 percent to similar American stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian stocks generally would be more appealing to Joseph M.
Scarella, a portfolio manager at Oppenheimer Capital, if he could
see a ``spike-like bottoming'' in commodity prices in three to six
months. Those prices are low because of worldwide oversupply as
well as the Asian situation. But he said improvement would be
gradual.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Root, who works at Goldman, Sachs as an analyst of paper
and forest-product companies, likes Donohue, Domtar and MacMillan
Bloedel, Canadian companies in that field. But he said he did not
expect their stock prices to crawl out of their trough ``until the
market gets its hands around the situation in Asia.''
</P>
<P>
   Sturm, whose Ivy Canada is one of the few Canadian-oriented
mutual funds available to American investors, says low commodity
prices have created a buying opportunity. He reasons that
commodities have nowhere to go but up and that when they do,
Canadian natural-resource companies can be expected to outperform
the broader market, as they have in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Chandler of Goldman, Sachs Canada pointed out that the
falling value of Canada's currency had helped to offset the damage
from the commodity slump, keeping Canadian output competitively
priced.
</P>
<P>
   Because of strong prospects for the overall Canadian economy,
Chandler said, Canadian stocks should return about 10 percent over
the next 12 months, just as they have over the last 12. Such a
steady pace may not look like much compared with the 28 percent
run-up of the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index in the last year,
but it could be soothing to investors who worry that the United
States market is due for a meltdown.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   There are signs that profits for Canadian companies have not yet
peaked. For the first quarter of 1998, they accounted for just 8.9
percent of Canada's national income.
</P>
<P>
   ``That tells us that corporate profits aren't yet
overextended,'' Chandler said. ``The historical average is closer
to 10 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   One way for cautious investors to play the Canadian stock market
is to invest in companies that generate a high percentage of their
revenue outside Canada. Robert Reiner, who helps manage the BT
Investment International Equity fund, sees that advantage in three
of his four favorite Canadian stocks.
</P>
<P>
   BCE, the parent of Bell Canada, is one of the few big
telecommunications companies that also has a well-situated interest
in the telephone equipment industry, which is booming worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Cadillac Fairview, which owns and develops commercial real
estate, has almost a fifth of its assets in the United States,
something that he suspects most investors haven't noticed.
</P>
<P>
   Newcourt Credit is currently Reiner's top pick. The company
arranges asset-based financing for large companies and
institutions, most of them outside Canada, and is the biggest pure
play in its field, which is led by GE Capital, Reiner said. He
expects Newcourt's earnings to grow 50 percent next year.
</P>
<P>
   His fourth recommendation, the Royal Bank of Canada, is somewhat
surprising. Canadian bank stocks have run way up recently, posting
much bigger gains than the S&AMP;P banking index showed this year and
last, and some investors might feel edgy about parking money in the
sector.
</P>
<P>
   But the Royal Bank is a leader in consolidating and has a merger
pending with the Bank of Montreal. And, unlike banks in the United
States, Canada's banks dominate the domestic mutual fund industry,
which is just taking off with consumers.
</P>
<P>
   According to Lori B. Appelbaum, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs,
Canadian bank stocks are trading at a discount of 10 percent to 15
percent to those of their American counterparts, even though
expected earnings growth is just as strong, at 12 percent to 13
percent annually. She likes Canadian Imperial Bank and Toronto
Dominion as well as Royal.
</P>
<P>
   But there are two clouds on the horizon for Canadian bank
stocks, according to Scarella at Oppenheimer Capital, and they both
emanate from the Bank of Canada, the country's central bank.
Interest rates could be raised to stem the slide of the currency,
and there could be a move to block the Royal Bank merger with the
Bank of Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this merger has only a 50-50 chance of happening,''
Scarella said. ``There's a lot of momentum building up against it,
especially among rural Canadians who think it will cause banks to
close up offices.''
</P>
<P>
   But money managers like Reiner remain bullish. ``There's this
bias that all you can buy in Canada are commodity stocks, when in
fact the country has some of the best banks, industrials and
technology companies in the world,'' he said. ``There are a lot of
overlooked stocks in Canada, and for the most part, U.S. mutual
fund managers still haven't discovered them.''

NUREYEV FOUNDATION IS UPHELD IN DISPUTE WITH FAMILY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Ill., France)  (bl) 
 By ANNA KISSELGOFF    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A federal judge in Manhattan has ruled in favor of
the Rudolf Nureyev Dance Foundation in Chicago in a dispute with
Nureyev's family over the $7 million from the dancer's estate used
to establish the foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Nureyev, the Russian-born ballet star who defected to the West
in 1961, died of AIDS in January 1993 in Paris. U.S. District Court
Judge Denny Chin ruled Thursday that Nureyev was of sound mind when
he instructed Barry Weinstein, his lawyer in Chicago, to transfer
the U.S. assets from his $21 million worldwide estate to the newly
created dance foundation two months before he died.
</P>
<P>
   Roza Nureeva-Francois, the dancer's sister, and her daughter,
Gouzel Noureeva, who live in France, objected to the transfer of
funds.
</P>
<P>
   Chin noted that they contended that Nureyev was unduly
influenced by Weinstein, whom Nureyev appointed to head the
foundation.
</P>
<P>
   The law firm of Schulte, Roth &AMP; Zabel in Manhattan then sought
to obtain a judgment declaring the gifts valid. Nureyev's family
filed counterclaims seeking to void the transfer. Nureyev relatives
also named as defendants included another sister, Razida Evgrafova,
and two nephews.
</P>
<P>
   In his ruling, the judge said: ``Rudolf Nureyev was a
strong-willed person who dared to defy a government. He was not a
person who could be manipulated or unduly influenced and this
remained true even near the end.''
</P>

CELLUCCI CHANGES MIND, URGES TEACHER COMPETENCY TESTING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Three days after he said he could do nothing about the
falling standards for teacher certification, Acting Governor Paul
Cellucci Friday called for competency testing for all teachers and
said he would fire those who failed the exam.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci also said he has asked John Silber, the chairman of the
Board of Education, to re-convene the board next week and take a
fourth vote to raise the passing standard on certification tests
for student teachers. In addition, Cellucci said he would introduce
legislation next week to forgive college loans for bright students
who choose to become teachers _ even though he once tried to kill
the very same ``Attracting Excellence to Teaching'' program.
</P>
<P>
   In an election year dominated locally and nationally by the
subject of education, Cellucci Friday sought to contain the almost
certain political damage after 59 percent of the state's aspiring
educators flunked Massachusetts' first-ever teacher test. The vote
earlier this week by the Board of Education to lower the tests'
passing grade so fewer teachers would fail, intensified criticism
that the administration was promoting incompetent teachers.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, House chairman Thomas Finneran railed at the test
results and called those who failed the test ``ignorant and
foolish'' for expecting they could still teach.
</P>
<P>
   While calling the majority of public school teachers capable and
competent, Cellucci said Friday he was concerned there are
thousands of classroom educators who are not meeting standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't allow mediocrity to be the standard for our students
or our teachers,'' Cellucci said.
</P>
<P>
   Silber Friday said he assured Cellucci that the vote to lower
the standards on the tests, which affects only the next two rounds
of testing, will be reversed next week. Silber, whose own calls to
test all teachers won him scorn from the teachers' union, said he
was pleased Cellucci was taking up the cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a very fine idea to require by law that the
teachers who are already in the field pass the test,'' Silber said.
``It's ambitious and right thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   But Cellucci's surprise announcement drew criticism from his
political opponents and angered representatives of the teacher's
unions, who accused him of election-year teacher bashing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Insulting,'' was the way Kathleen Kelly, president of the
Massachusetts Federation of Teachers, described Cellucci's proposal
to test longtime teachers for literacy skills. ``These kind of
attacks on the teaching profession are the fastest way to
discourage people from becoming teachers,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Both Kelly, and Stephen Gorrie, president of the Massachusetts
Teachers Association, said teachers who are already certified
should not have to take the exam and risk losing their jobs. Both
said that there are already job performance reviews and a system in
place to evaluate teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am shocked at such a suggestion,'' said Ronald Hambleton, a
professor of education and psychology at the University of
Massachusetts at Amherst, a nationally known teacher testing
expert. ``I would take the 20 years of experience over eight hours
of tests. If a good number of experienced teachers failed it, then
the problem would be in the test.''
</P>
<P>
   Hambleton noted that Massachusetts students fare well on
standardized tests, a clear indication that solid teaching is going
on in the classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   And Mark Roosevelt, the principal architect of the 1993
education reform law, said ``there are reasons to be hesitant.
Let's say you test current teachers and 50 percent fail. Who are
you gong to replace them with?''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph D. Malone, the Republican State Treasurer who is
challenging Cellucci for their party's nomination for Governor,
said Cellucci had demonstrated his inability to lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have felt all along that the highest possible standard
should be applied to people seeking to become teachers,'' Malone
said. ``The difference between Paul Cellucci and myself is that I
would have made sure the Board of Education understood my position
prior to their first vote on this matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Patricia McGovern, the former state senator running for the
Democratic nomination for governor, repeated her call for the
firing of every member of the Board of Education and blasted
Cellucci for his late arrival to the matter of improving public
education.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's playing catch up,'' McGovern said. ``He puts his finger
up in the air and tests the wind.''
</P>
<P>
   Jane Lane, a spokeswoman for Brian Donnelly, another Democratic
gubernatorial candidate, noted that Silber and the Board of
Education serve at Cellucci's pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was his board of education that lowered the test standard
but when he gets beaten up in the press and there's an outcry from
the voters he starts to back track,'' Lane said.
</P>
<P>
   And Scott Harshbarger, the Democratic attorney general who is
also running for governor, described Cellucci's change of heart as
``an incredible example of damage control from an administration
that has utterly failed for the last seven years to take the lead
on the most important challenge we face.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides testing current teachers and raising the bar on would-be
teachers, Cellucci said he would forgive college loans for people
who become teachers in order to attract the best and the brightest
to the profession.
</P>
<P>
   But that is not a new proposal. The ``Attracting Excellence to
Teaching'' program was created in the 1993 education reform law to
help debt-ridden teachers repay student loans. Former Governor
William F. Weld and Cellucci had actually tried to kill the
initiative in their 1995 plan to downsize state government.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Cellucci said the best way to attract bright
students to teaching is to reduce barriers to certification.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you got rid of all these bureaucratic hurdles, you wouldn't
need a program like this,'' Cellucci said. ``You'd be able to
attract quality people from all walks of life.''
</P>
<P>
   In the current budget process, Senate President Thomas
Birmingham said the Senate budget would appropriate 30 percent more
for the excellence program than Cellucci would. He said the program
had not been properly marketed over the years, nor used to attract
bright students to teaching.
</P>
<P>
   Of Cellucci, Birmingham said, ``His conversion is welcome, even
if it's a deathbed conversion.''

COMMENTARY: THIN-SKINNED U.S.A. 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By FRANK RICH    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A show must be censored because it is not only ``pornographic''
but presents an ethnic group as ``backward and ignorant.'' Who
could be speaking?
</P>
<P>
   Was it the Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights, which
has campaigned against Terrence McNally's ``gay Jesus'' play,
``Corpus Christi''? Or was it the Hispanic groups that protested
``Seinfeld''? Or was it the black employees at the Library of
Congress, whose protest led to the dismantling of an exhibit about
slavery? Or was it the Southern Baptist Convention, which found a
clergyman in purported sexual arousal in Disney's animated ``Little
Mermaid''?
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it was none of the above. The censorious words I read
in the paper were from cultural commissars in Shanghai who have
blocked the Kunqu Opera Company's production of ``The Peony
Pavilion'' from traveling to New York's Lincoln Center next month _
an outrageous act of totalitarian thought-policing that has
appalled Americans and cast another shadow on President Clinton's
trip to China.
</P>
<P>
   The only good news about this incident is that it reminds us
that we have a Bill of Rights. Our government may deny grants to
artists it regards as indecent _ as the Supreme Court seemed to say
in a muddled ruling this week _ but it can't shut them down.
</P>
<P>
   Not that we should congratulate ourselves too much. If we don't
have censorship, we now have an increasing wave of self-censorship,
in culture both high and low. Let any theater, museum or
entertainment company float a project that might offend someone _
even sight unseen _ and that someone will scream, tempting the
offending party to retreat or stick to the tried, the safe and the
PG-rated in the future.
</P>
<P>
   No one can call this insidious syndrome censorship, because the
protesters are always careful to say they are not demanding
censorship and their targets are equally careful to say expressly
that they do not back down in response to protests.
</P>
<P>
   But it's a disingenuous dance. Does anyone believe that NBC
elected not to rerun the Puerto Rican Parade ``Seinfeld'' episode
for any reason other than the public complaints? Or that the
Library of Congress postponed an exhibit on Freud solely for
budgetary reasons rather than because of a heated petition campaign
by such prominent anti-Freudians as Gloria Steinem?
</P>
<P>
   This cautious cultural climate _ fueled by the right, the left
and virtually every religious, ethnic and racial group _ can't be
accurately described by that tortured term PC, which is always in
the eye of the beholder anyway. A better term would be that
old-fashioned adjective thin-skinned.
</P>
<P>
   People have the right to protest ``Seinfeld'' _ and Jewish
groups did so more frequently than Hispanics _ but it is a sitcom,
for Heaven's sake. Should it be labeled ``racist'' because Kramer
accidentally set a Puerto Rican flag on fire and then tried to
stomp the fire out?
</P>
<P>
   When the Catholic League isn't campaigning against ``Corpus
Christi'' _ a still unseen and unfinished work that will be viewed
only by voluntary patrons in an off-Broadway theater _ its web site
is citing as ``anti-Catholic'' everyone and everything from Jackie
Mason, Mad magazine and a Rudolph Giuliani sketch on ``Saturday
Night Live'' to the musical revue ``Forever Plaid,'' the New York
Metropolitan Opera's ``The Voyage'' and TV's ``Chicago Hope.''
</P>
<P>
   The more self-censorship that ensues, the more our culture
becomes pablum. Since its Enola Gay disaster, the Smithsonian
Institution has postponed (apparently forever) an exhibit on the
Vietnam War, even as its National Air and Space Museum has staged
an elaborate, debate-free exhibit on Hollywood's fictional ``Star
Wars.''
</P>
<P>
   The forthcoming ``Corpus Christi'' notwithstanding, it's the
lack of unpredictable large-scale theater pieces in New York right
now that made ``The Peony Pavilion'' such a hot ticket for famished
local culture vultures in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   The innovative director of this derailed opera, Chen Shi-Zheng,
is now a U.S. citizen, having arrived here in 1987, seeking
artistic freedom. Speaking of his current tussle with Chinese
authorities, he told The New York Times, ``It reminds me of the
Cultural Revolution, when things that have no relevance to artistic
debate take over, like ideology and politics.''
</P>
<P>
   He needn't worry about that kind of nonsense here, of course _
at least as long as he sticks with Ming Dynasty works like the 1598
``Peony Pavilion'' that don't hit too close to his new home of
America, 1998. &QL;

   MICROSOFT-HATCH (Washington) The chairman of the Senate
Judiciary Committee Friday vowed to open a new set of hearings into
Microsoft. Sen. Orrin Hatch issued a report criticizing Microsoft
for allegedly misleading his committee about a variety of the
company's practices, and he complained that the company has tried
to use public relations to distract the public from its conduct.
Hatch said the hearings will focus on Microsoft's BackOffice family
of server products. He said the hearings will also focus on
``practices and developments affecting access to, and transactions
on, the Internet.'' Sen. Slade Gorton blasted Hatch's ``lonely and
increasingly unsuccessful battle against Microsoft.''

   SALMON-WASHINGTON-CANADA (Undated) Washington Gov. Gary Locke
cut a limited salmon deal with Canada that will entail additional
sacrifices by U.S. fishers. Washington boats will reduce coho
harvests but get some added Fraser River sockeye catch. Washington
salmon fishers, especially recreational fishing businesses, are
expected to protest that they have already been squeezed too much.
But Locke wanted to offer something in response to Canada's tough
restrictions on its own fishers to protect disappearing Canadian
coho runs and reduce its harvests of Washington's dwindling
chinooks. Canadian fishing interests may dismiss Washington's
sacrifices as minimal. Alaska was unable to come to terms with
Canada this year, and Washington's Indian tribes remain a
question-mark.

HATCH VOWS MORE CONGRESSIONAL HEARINGS ON MICROSOFT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee
Friday vowed to open a new set of hearings into whether Microsoft
is poised to dominate the rapidly growing world of electronic
commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, issued a report criticizing Microsoft
for allegedly misleading his committee about a variety of the
company's practices, and he complained that the company has tried
to use public relations to distract the public from its conduct.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch, who has been a persistent critic of the software giant,
said he would open his hearings after the Senate returns from its
July 4 recess. The hearings are unlikely to lead to any change in
law, but would provide a forum for Microsoft's critics to air their
grievances.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe this is one of the more important policy issues of
our day, one which will have far-reaching ramifications for years
to come, and that it would be remiss for lawmakers and law
enforcers not to be paying close attention to this issue,'' Hatch
said in a speech on the Senate floor.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch said the hearings will focus on Microsoft's BackOffice
family of server products, which are designed to integrate various
computer functions for businesses. He said the hearings will also
focus on ``practices and developments affecting access to, and
transactions on, the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft spokesman Jim Cullinan said the company has not been
informed of any plan to hold hearings, but that ``Sen. Hatch's
comments were very unfortunate and inaccurate.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., blasted Hatch's ``lonely and
increasingly unsuccessful battle against Microsoft.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sen. Hatch and the Department of Justice are little interested
in the facts or merits of the case, but surely interested in
bringing the most successful software company in the nation to its
knees so that less successful, less competitive companies that do
not have the ability to succeed on their own can do so,'' Gorton
said.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch's comments came just a day after Microsoft formally
launched Windows 98, the latest version of the company's operating
system for personal computers. And earlier this week, Microsoft won
a significant victory against its critics when a federal appeals
court threw out an order requiring changes in Windows 95.
</P>
<P>
   But the company still faces a now-weakened but still significant
lawsuit challenging Windows 98. That case is set for trial in
September.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch Friday raised several new concerns about Microsoft's
conduct. In particular, the senator accused Microsoft of having
``seen fit to engage in a game of hide the ball,'' misleading his
committee and the public through a combination of misinformation
and a distracting public relations offensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft has, regrettably, seen fit to deploy a massive p.r.
campaign grounded in spin control and misdirection, as opposed to
engaging the American public on the basis of the facts and the
merits,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch said Microsoft misled the Judiciary Committee about its
licensing agreements with Internet service providers, about its
contracts with Internet content providers, and about several other
matters.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft denied misleading the committee, and said its spending
on public relations was necessary to counter similar actions of its
competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Hatch also complained that Microsoft and its allies _ namely
Gorton _ have prevented the Justice Department from getting a
budget boost to pay for antitrust activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find it rather surprising that any one company would ...
have the hubris to ... seek to restrain a federal law enforcement
agency that has an obligation to enforce the laws,'' Hatch said.
</P>
<P>
   But Gorton said the antitrust division shouldn't get extra money
because ``these (legal) actions are a waste of the taxpayers' money
and represent the use of the taxpayers' money for the pursuit of
private antitrust remedies that, if they are appropriate at all,
should be financed by the competitors who seek them.''

SERBS READY FOR LARGE-SCALE ATTACKS ON KOSOVO REBELS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ps) 
 By CHRIS HEDGES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Serbia _ Belgrade has ordered its military and special
police to mount large-scale attacks in Kosovo to recapture pockets
held by ethnic Albanian rebels and reopen roads the separatist
rebels have blocked for weeks, western diplomats and military
officials said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The escalation of the fight against the rebels came as Richard
Holbrooke, the U.S. special envoy, left Pristina empty-handed after
four days of shuttle talks with the Yugoslav president, Slobodan
Milosevic, and ethnic Albanian leaders. ``We all agree that we are
at a dangerous moment and our goal remains to prevent the fighting
that's already going on from escalating to a general war,''
Holbrooke said.
</P>
<P>
   There appeared to be little left that western diplomats could do
to prevent the assault, given the intransigence of the insurgents
and determination of Milosevic to retake the main arteries in the
province.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats said they feared the attacks, which could begin within
hours or days, might lead to further fighting beyond the borders of
the province and could usher in a low-intensity war that could last
for years.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke had hoped to secure an agreement from the Kosovo
Liberation Army rebels to take down barricades along main routes in
the province. He had planned to use the reopening of the roads as
leverage to get Milosevic to call off an attack against the
insurgents by the 50,000 special police and troops deployed in
Kosovo. But the rebels, who say they will fight until they have
achieved their goal of an independent state, rebuffed Holbrooke.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels' lack of a central command made it difficult for
Holbrooke to be sure his message had reached the top rebel
authorities. He asked Adem Demaci, a militant political leader who
openly supports the rebel movement, to pass on a message for him,
but Demaci was unsure whom to contact, western diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
   On his visit here, Holbrooke, reiterating demands made by the
United States and its allies, called for a resumption of talks
between Belgrade and the pacifist ethnic Albanian leader, Ibrahim
Rugova, that were broken off by the ethnic Albanians because of the
fighting. He also called for all checkpoints to be removed, for
Serbian special units to be withdrawn and for the approximately
100,000 ethnic Albanians driven from their homes in the attacks to
be allowed to return to their villages.
</P>
<P>
   Washington has called on Belgrade to grant the ethnic Albanians
the autonomous status it revoked eight years ago but does not
support the drive by the insurgents to create an independent state.
</P>
<P>
   There were numerous indications on Friday that an attack was
imminent.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav MiG-21 fighter planes roared in pairs down the runway
of the Pristina airport. The military, which has been warned that
NATO is prepared to take punitive measures including air strikes,
has set up 30mm anti-aircraft guns and SA-9 Gaskin surface-to-air
missiles around the airport and on hilltops. There has been a
concentration of tanks, armored personnel carriers, and heavy
artillery on the edge of the rebel-held pockets and large-scale
movement of troops along the roads outside of the provincial
capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``The signs are there of a pending attack,'' said a senior
western military official. ``It will take the Serbs a few hours to
roll into these areas and smash through the roadblocks. The rebels
don't stand a chance. But this attack will trigger a wider,
deadlier war, bringing the conflict to the cities, creating small,
mobile bands of armed men that could see fighting here last for
years. The Serbs will make some short term gains, but this assault
could mean they have lost Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   Several hundred people have been killed since February when the
police launched the first Serbian attack aimed at wiping out the
rebel movement. More than 80 people were killed in the attack, many
of them civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Belgrade, which is spending an estimated $2 million a day to
keep its forces deployed in Kosovo, apparently believes that
another strike against the rebels, who have taken control of as
much as 40 percent of the province since March, will be the final
blow. This will be the third, and largest, counter-insurgency drive
against the rebels since the attacks began in March. Each drive has
only exacerbated the violence and pushed the province, where ethnic
Albanians outnumber Serbs nine to one, into a wider rebellion
against Serbian rule.
</P>
<P>
   There is daily skirmishing and tons of weapons and ammunition,
along with hundreds of ethnic Albanian fighters, have crossed the
border from northern Albania into Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke warned on Friday that the siege by the ethnic Albanian
rebels around Kijevo, a Serbian town cut off for over a month from
by the rebels, would not be tolerated much longer by Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   The outpost, on the main east-west road between Pristina and the
western, Serbian-dominated town of Pec, is under daily attack and
food is scarce. He called the village ``the most dangerous place in
Europe'' because a battle to liberate the town by the Serbs could
trigger a wider war.
</P>
<P>
   He warned that in their talks Milosevic had repeatedly asserted
``the right to keep the roads in his country open.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm leaving this region today with no magic bullets for
peace,'' Holbrooke said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   After Holbrooke's departure on Friday, Ambassador Richard Miles,
the U.S. chief of mission in Yugoslavia, and Christopher Hill, the
U.S. ambassador to Macedonia, made an attempt to prevent a Serbian
attack. They drove out to the rebel barricade at Lapushnik where
trashed cars and cement blocks have been set up for the last seven
weeks on the road from Pristina to Pec.
</P>
<P>
   The diplomats sat on a grassy slope under European oaks and
waited half an hour for the arrival of a local rebel commander. A
motley collection of rebels carrying AK-47 assault rifles and
rocket propelled grenades eyed the diplomats nervously until the
commander, wearing fatigues and a beret and carrying a
walkie-talkie, arrived.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are against all blockage of roads,'' Hill told the
commander. ``We need time. We are deeply concerned and deeply
engaged in finding a peaceful solution, but a peaceful solution is
the only solution.''
</P>
<P>
   The rebel commander promised to deliver the message to his
superiors. The diplomats traveled silently back to Pristina in two
white armored vehicles along the deserted road, covered with spent
shell casings.

THE LAWYER AND THE COLUMNIST 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, June 28 1998; f and k coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One way that I think of Mike Barnicle is as the guy who replaced
me on the ``The News Hour'' with Jim Lehrer. After giving me a
brief tryout as the Boston voice on its regional panel years ago,
the show went straight to the Globe metro columnist, and he has
been there ever since, a great success. There as elsewhere, he is
Boston Mike.
</P>
<P>
   Barnicle today is probably the second best pure newsman in
Boston, after Eileen McNamara (the paper's other metro columnist),
not counting Will McDonough, who covers sports. On a wide range of
topics, Barnicle is the go-to guy _ when you absolutely,
positively, have got to know what happened on one of his beats.
(There are some conspicuous exceptions, but I'll come to that.)
</P>
<P>
   His name got dragged through the mud last week, thanks to
Harvard Law School professor and defense attorney Alan Dershowitz,
who compared Barnicle to Patricia Smith, a third Globe metro
columnist whose resignation was sought and received after the paper
discovered she had fabricated material for her columns. In a series
of faxes, the Harvard professor accused the Globe of maintaining a
double standard.
</P>
<P>
   Dershowitz's attack was low, deceptive, and, up to a point,
effective. It forced the newspaper to mount a defense of a man who
for eight years had been accused of nothing much more serious than
a parking violation. &UR;  &LR; It impugned the newspaper's handling of a
very painful problem.
</P>
<P>
   The proximate reason for Dershowitz's complaint was Barnicle's
attribution to him in 1990 of a remark made in 1982: ``I love Asian
women, don't you? They're...they're so submissive.'' Barnicle said
the quote had been recalled from a chance sidewalk conversation of
eight years earlier; it was injected into a column about a feud
between Dershowitz and Barnicle's friend William Bulger, then the
Senate president.
</P>
<P>
   Dershowitz denied ever having said it. He threatened mightily,
eventually reaching a resolution of the matter with the
newspaper &UR;  &LR; _ thereby avoiding the process of mutual discovery that
would have shed light on the question of whether the youthful Dersh
had been racist, sexist, or, in his own words, a potential
adulterer, or Barnicle a liar.
</P>
<P>
   The statute of limitations on complaints like this one ran out
long ago. Barnicle has been writing his column for 25 years. It is
the hardest job on the paper.
</P>
<P>
   It was in 1973 that Barnicle was recruited by Globe political
columnist Bob Healy and editor Tom Winship to be groomed to replace
legendary columnist George Frazier. ``His column will start in the
Evening Globe as soon as he learns to type,'' said the
announcement. Before that he had booted around Washington for a few
years as a Capitol cop, an elevator operator, speechwriter, and
screenwriter _ Robert Redford's ``The Candidate'' was partly of his
devising.
</P>
<P>
   Having never been apprenticed as a reporter, the boy writer had
a rough enough time of it in the 1970s before he began to settle
down. He was accused of ventriloquism, borrowing (by Mike Royko
regularly), and even fabrication. He denied it all and went on
turning out columns that firmly established him as the newspaper's
premier stylist.
</P>
<P>
   For Barnicle had the sine qua non, the inimitable voice of the
city. Born in Worcester, Mass., he grew up it Fitchburg, went to
school at Boston University, when it was still a loose
confederation of Methodist schools. Having lived in Washington and
New York, he returned to Boston to make a living. He understood the
city in its most intimate particulars: its tribal loyalities, sense
of humor, smoldering rage. Founded in 1630, Boston's motto even
today is, ``We wouldn't tell you if your shirt-tail was on fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnicle is about nothing if not connections. He has friends and
fans in every conceivable part of the city. It helps that he has a
brother who is an influential Boston homicide detective. It helps,
too, that his wife is the advertising and public relations chieftan
for a major bank, and that they live with their children _ his,
hers, theirs _ in Lincoln, Boston's single fanciest suburb. But he
commutes most days to Dorchester, Cambridge, Roxbury, and every
other corner of the city.
</P>
<P>
   There he hangs out with cops, often being taken for one, which
helps him get his juiciest quotes. He takes batting practice with
the Red Sox in Florida, haunts park benches and newsstands, goes to
enough wakes to qualify as a professional mourner. He moves easily
in a city where the Senate president's brother was the town's top
mobster and where the confidence, and even the protection, of the
local office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation may have
extended to each.
</P>
<P>
   Boston, remember, is not Chicago or New York; Massachusetts is
one of the few states in the union where the political capital was
not long ago moved away from the commercial center as as way of
cutting down on temptation.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, Barnicle had character and grit. He learned,
experimented with forms, discrarding some, retaining others, a
pocket O. Henry one year, the reincarnation of Jimmy Cannon the
next. He raised the bar, like a weak-gloved ball player who batted
.245, .270, then finally .305. And so he became a star, adding a
regular gig on ``Chronicle,'' a nightly television news magazine
show; mixing it up between times with Don Imus on the radio in the
morning, on the MSNBC cable network at night. He is Boston Mike, a
man who grew into his role.
</P>
<P>
   For 15 years or so, Barnicle regularly has hit the newspaper
equivalent of .300, improving his fielding at least to average (if
not exactly Golden Glove), playing a lot, and participating in many
of the biggest games. He writes three times a week. When he is not
reporting (or raising kids), he turns out a mix of sentiment,
shrewd observation, and one-liners with flashes of wonderful
writing. (He once described a certain politician as being ``cuter
than his baby pictures.'') He is too loyal to his friends, too
tough on his enemies, but then that is just another Boston trait.
He is not Breslin, not Hamill, not Cannon, not Caen, not Royko. He
is not DiMaggio either, nor Mays, nor Mantle: more like Duke
Snider, with some Carl Yastrzemski thrown in on the side.
</P>
<P>
   (If Patty Smith had had the same help as Barnicle, she might
have made it here too, though I doubt it. Her orientation to news
was too weak; her orientation to Boston nonexistent. She was a
Chicago woman through and through. And she came to her newspaper
column 20 years after Barnicle, in more-demanding, less-forgiving
times).
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Fifty years ago, Boston was called ``the poor farm of American
journalism,'' and deservedly so. But the economics of the business
changed, and thanks to the Globe's Taylor family and Tom Winship,
and secondarily to Rupert Murdoch &UR;  &LR; (when he owned the Boston
Herald), Pat Purcell (who does now), and Don Forst (a highly
regarded former Herald editor), Boston became one of four or five
centers of journalism in the country. At the top of the heap are
city columnists like Barnicle, Howie Carr, Shelley Cohen, Margery
Eagan, Peter Gelzinis, Ellen Goodman, Alan Lupo, Christopher Lydon,
Eileen McNamara, Brian Mooney, Martin F. Nolan, David Nyhan, and
Joan Vennochi. Boston journalisam is still famously eccentric, but
it has become nationally first rate, perhaps even the best in the
nation. No organization has had more to do with this than the
Globe.
</P>
<P>
   I bring all this up to call attention to the source &UR;  &LR; of last
week's midslinging against Barnicle.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is that Harvard Law School, where Alan Dershowitz hangs
his hat, has been a far more troubled place in recent years than
has the Globe. First it was the ``crits,'' a band of legal
nihilists whose shenanigans turned faculty meetings into
battlefields. Then there was an ongoing controversy over the
school's inability to appoint female and minority professors. &UR;  &LR; And
of course there is the unsolved murder of Mary Jo Frug, whose
husband, Gerald, is a law school professor. The police
investigation of her death was hindered and hushed through a
combination of legal bluster and arrogance &UR;  &LR; from a circle and
friends from the law school.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  And through it all there was the man his students know as
``the Dersh,'' flamboyantly representing a series of famous
clients: Claus von Bulow, O.J. Simpson, Louise Woodward,
proclaiming all the while that here was the heart of the legal
system.
</P>
<P>
   Granted that a professional school does not seek to impose the
same tight scrum of ethical conduct on its members as does a a
newspaper. Granted, too, that Dean Robert Clark has calmed it down
and cleaned it up; the Harvard Law School has ceased to be a
circus. And Alan Dershowitz is a fine defense attorney. He
criticizes the powerful without fear or favor. He has proven he
came hold a grudge with the best of them.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; But Dershowitz throwing rocks at The Boston Globe from the
shelter of Hauser Hall is still a spectacle. We do a better job
maintaining our standards and ventilating our problems here at the
newspaper than they do over there.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ President Clinton was received by Chinese President
Jiang Zemin on Saturday in a military ceremony on Tiananmen Square,
the vast expanse through which modern Chinese history has flowed,
from the declaration of the communist state in 1949 to the crushing
of democracy demonstrations 40 years later.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton stood mute throughout, as is customary at such arrival
ceremonies. He and Jiang then inspected army troops and reviewed an
honor guard on ground that human rights advocates around the world
consider stained with the blood of martyrs.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has defended his appearance before the Great Hall of the
People on the edge of Tiananmen Square as the expected behavior of
a state visitor to China. The square is the site of the student-led
demonstrations that ended in terror and bloodshed on June 3 and 4,
1989, when Chinese troops moving into the city center mowed down
hundreds of civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's appearance on Saturday morning dramatized China's
struggle between memory and forgetting.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese leadership hopes to consign to history the events of
the spring of 1989, when indelible images of blood-letting in the
streets and of a lone protester standing before a column of tanks
were broadcast around the world.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton, harshly criticized in the United States for lending
his prestige to Beijing's leaders by attending the ceremony, hopes
that his presence here will force the world to remember that bloody
night nine years ago. He was expected to speak of the lessons of
Tiananmen at a speech scheduled for Monday morning at Beijing
University.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the White House sharply criticized Beijing for the
harassment of dissidents on the first day of Clinton's state visit,
calling the detentions ``thoroughly unacceptable.'' But the
president did not take steps to impose any punishment or withhold
any favors in response.
</P>
<P>
   China demonstrated little concern about the detentions, denying
that anyone had actually been ``arrested'' and offering American
diplomats no explanation for their actions. Chinese authorities
routinely round up dissidents and other potential trouble-makers
before important events.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing is also showing little flexibility on the major items on
the summit agenda, hoping to win last-minute concessions from the
American side, administration officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Hopes dimmed for substantive progress on human rights and
missile technology transfers, and the White House has so far been
thwarted in its pleas to allow live television coverage inside
China of the rhetorical centerpiece of the president's visit, the
Beijing University speech. An official denunciation of the Dalai
Lama and criticism of the Clinton administration's appointment of a
coordinator for Tibetan issues promised few advances on this issue.
</P>
<P>
   Using unusually harsh language, Sandy Berger, the president's
national security adviser, said that the Chinese internal security
apparatus was ``doing what comes naturally'' by harassing outspoken
opponents of the government who officials fear might embarrass
Beijing during Clinton's visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are not debris to be swept up for a visitor,'' Berger
said at a briefing for reporters on Friday in Xian, before the
presidential entourage flew to Beijing for the summit meeting. ``We
certainly will not accept this.''
</P>
<P>
   Human rights groups reported that four dissidents were detained
in two Chinese cities and one was removed from Xian in the hours
before Clinton's arrival on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese authorities added to the friction on Friday night by
impeding two Asian-American White House staffers who were trying to
load the president's luggage aboard Air Force One at Xian's
airport. Mike McCurry, the White House press secretary, attributed
the incident to ``over-eager'' Chinese security officials who were
not expecting to find Asians in the presidential party.
</P>
<P>
   The incident was resolved in a few minutes and the stewards were
allowed to board the aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Berger tried to explain Beijing's crackdown on dissidents as a
remnant of its police-state past, a preference for order over
political freedom. He said the repression was improving, if slowly.
</P>
<P>
   ``China is changing, but there are still forces that are pulling
the other direction, that are resisting,'' Berger said. ``I think
China's human rights record is terrible. I think China is an
authoritarian nation, as I've said before. I think there's been
some progress in human rights, but it has been not nearly enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the area of public dissent, they are still totally
unacceptable. I don't think this is directed at President Clinton.
The fact that it happens generally in connection with these kinds
of visits, it is not appropriate, it is not necessary,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Clinton said he found reports of the
detentions ``disturbing,'' but gave no indication that he would
change his approach to China in response. ``I think it makes the
case, it makes it all the more important that we continue to work
with the Chinese and engage them.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Jendrzejczyk, director of Human Rights Watch Asia, said
that the administration's unwillingness to respond with more than
words was a sign that the White House was ``desperate not to offend
the Chinese.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The administration is walking on eggshells, determined to
demonstrate that this visit represents a major breakthrough in
relations,'' Jendrzejczyk said. ``The Chinese are being tough, they
know their bottom line, and the administration seems willing to
accommodate them at any cost.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   He called on the president to signal his displeasure by
withholding something the Chinese want, such as the planned visit
to the United States later this year by Prime Minister Zhu Rongji.
</P>
<P>
   But Berger said the United States planned to do nothing beyond
verbal protests. He said it would be against American interests to
impose any punishment or withhold any agreements as a result of the
police action. And he offered a partial excuse for the Chinese
action, saying it was not as severe as previous roundups of
dissidents before the arrival of important foreign visitors.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has been pressing for China to permit the live,
nationwide broadcast of Clinton's speech on Monday, in which the
president is expected to deliver his strongest message on human
rights.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing has resisted and White House officials said on Saturday
that it appeared likely that the speech would be seen virtually
everywhere in the world but China.
</P>
<P>
   A largely symbolic agreement to retarget nuclear-tipped missiles
away from each other's cities appeared to be slipping away because
the Chinese continue to insist that the deal be linked to an
American pledge not to be the first to use nuclear weapons. Berger
said the right to launch a nuclear first strike was a core tenet of
American military doctrine and was not negotiable.
</P>
<P>
   There was also hope that the summit meeting would produce a
commitment by China to formally join the international
non-proliferation agreement known as the Missile Technology Control
Regime. But those hopes have faded in recent days as China demanded
to be exempted from certain of its provisions, particularly those
regarding export of missile technology.
</P>
<P>
   The White House had also hoped to win commitments from Beijing
on human rights, including the release of jailed dissidents and a
relaxation of the suppression of the Tibetan autonomy movement. The
American side also was seeking a firm date for China to sign the
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, but Beijing
has so far not delivered.
</P>
<P>
   Berger said on Saturday: ``I would not anticipate that we would
see the fruits of those discussions while we are here.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that the release of three prominent dissidents came only
weeks or months after the first Clinton-Jiang summit last October,
and that the two countries had made progress on other fronts,
including the environment, health care and legal reform projects.
</P>
<P>
   After a two-hour meeting on Saturday morning, the two presidents
planned to make public statements and take a few questions from
reporters. Clinton was then scheduled to have lunch with Zhu and
attend a state dinner in the Great Hall of the People on Saturday
evening.

FACE TO FACE WITH THE `LAGER LOUTS'

 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LENS, FRANCE _ They were berating the woman in front of the
train when I arrived, threatening to slap her silly unless she
allowed them to climb aboard. All three of them had near-empty
bottles of Budweiser --- the ``official beer of the World Cup'' ---
in their hands, and by the looks of them, it wasn't their first.
</P>
<P>
   What they didn't have were tickets for the last leg of their
journey from jolly olde ``Ingerland'' to Lens, and the woman from
French rail wasn't about to let them on the train without them.
Then --- bad news for the rest of us --- the conductor arrived,
welcomed them into the car, and disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   It was my first experience with England's ``lager louts,'' and
although there was nothing present to suggest they might be the
hooligans we've watched on Sky news, I'd just as soon not run
across them again.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as the conductor left our car and the train began to
depart Lille, the loudest of the bunch --- which had now swelled to
seven --- decided the best thing to do was urinate against the
door, all the while singing some dirty ditty that was, for the most
part, incomprehensible. The rest of the train --- those of us who
hadn't been drinking the previous seven hours, since 6 a.m. ---
looked on in horror, but what could we do? Shout, ``Stop that
now!'' Yeah, right.
</P>
<P>
   When he was done, he joined his mates at the next door of the
car as the puddle of pee started rolling around the floor. There
they sang and shouted, things like ``In-ger-land, In-ger-land,
In-gerland!'' and ``No surrender!'' Then another in the group threw
up on the floor, and they retreated further down the car.
</P>
<P>
   So we were penned in by urine and vomit, a World Cup experience
if ever there was one. A 40ish couple next to me, from England ---
both wearing England jerseys --- just shook their heads. ``They
give real England fans a bad name,'' he complained.
</P>
<P>
   She was curious about news reports that the German neo-Nazis
were heading to Lens to battle the Brits. ``Hopefully,'' she said,
pounding her fist into her palm, ``they'll meet up with that lot.''

CONSERVATIVE SENATORS CONTINUE TO BLOCK HORMEL NOMINATION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As senators departed for a weeklong recess Friday,
they left behind what has become an increasingly nasty debate over
the stalled nomination of James Hormel, who is openly gay, to be
ambassador to Luxembourg.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of conservatives has blocked a confirmation vote,
charging that the heir to a meat-packing fortune is a gay activist
who has offended religious people.
</P>
<P>
   But Hormel's supporters say that the 65-year old nominee, a
former dean of the University of Chicago law school and a major
philanthropist, is being held hostage by a few Republicans eager to
please socially conservative voters.
</P>
<P>
   The suspicion that conservatives intend to make Hormel an
election-year issue was heightened in the past few weeks by the
incendiary remarks of some GOP leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., who has refused to
schedule a vote on Hormel, called homosexuality a sin and compared
gays to kleptomaniacs and alcoholics.
</P>
<P>
   Another Senate leader, Don Nickles, R-Okla., charged that Hormel
was promoting ``immoral behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   James Inhofe, R-Okla., one of the first senators to openly
oppose Hormel, likened him to David Duke, the former Ku Klux
Klansman and politician.
</P>
<P>
   David Smith, a spokesman for the Human Rights Campaign, a gay
rights group which Hormel helped found, said that Lott and some
other senators are ``pandering to religious political activists who
have identified this nomination as one of their core issues in
'98.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott's comments have not gone over well with all of his
colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't think we should be characterizing people that
way,'' Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   While Hutchison has not decided how she would vote on Hormel,
she said his sexual orientation is not an issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly do not think we should not have a vote (on Hormel)
because he is homosexual,'' she said. ``I am looking carefully at
questions raised about any impropriety in his behavior that would
bear on his representation of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, who has not shied away from
criticizing gay rights in his previous campaigns, said that
Hormel's homosexuality should not disqualify him.
</P>
<P>
   ``In and of itself, I don't think it should, no,'' said Gramm.
</P>
<P>
   The Texan said he recently met with Hormel and called the get
together a ``very positive step.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was pleased with the meeting. He is sending me material to
read,'' said Gramm, who has not decided how he would vote on the
nominee.
</P>
<P>
   If confirmed, Hormel, who was nominated by President Clinton
last fall, would be the first openly gay U.S. ambassador.
</P>
<P>
   Some conservative activists have argued that Hormel's activities
in the gay community should be an issue for senators considering
his credentials to be an envoy to an overwhelmingly Catholic
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``James Hormel has made his life career promoting what should be
his private sexual behavior,'' said Steven Schwalm, a senior
analyst at the Family Research Council.
</P>
<P>
   Schwalm said that Hormel has supported an organization that goes
into schools to educate students about homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives are also upset that he helped finance a gay wing
at the San Francisco public library that includes books they find
objectionable.
</P>
<P>
   To indicate Hormel is not respectful of religion, opponents have
distributed a video of a San Francisco gay pride parade that
features the nominee laughing as ``the Sisters of Perpetual
Indulgence,'' a group of men dressed up as nuns, passed by.
</P>
<P>
   Hormel's supporters say that his opponents have distorted his
activities, arguing that the foundation he heads, Equidex Inc.,
gives to a wide range of cultural and civic groups. They say he
can't be held responsible for every activity of every group that
his foundation has funded over the years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Hormel is exactly the kind of person who should be
encouraged to engage in public service,'' said Jim Hock, a
spokesman for California Democrat Dianne Feinstein, the lead
senator working on Hormel's behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein's office has compiled a list of more than 60 senators
who believe that at least a vote should be held on the nomination.
Neither Hutchison nor Gramm are on that list.
</P>
<P>
   Hormel has garnered endorsement from some unlikely quarters,
including Sen. Orrin Hatch, a staunch conservative from Utah, and
George Schultz, former Secretary of State under President Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Al D'Amato, who is waging a tough re-election campaign in
New York, also wrote to Lott urging action on the nomination and
charging that Hormel's confirmation ``is being obstructed for one
reason and one reason only, the fact he's gay.''
</P>
<P>
   Hormel's former wife and his five children have also rallied
behind him.
</P>
<P>
   A Minnesota native who has lived in San Francisco since 1976,
Hormel has been a big donor to the Democratic Party. He was
initially considered for an ambassadorship to Fiji, but that was
rejected because of strict anti- sodomy laws there.
</P>
<P>
   The Foreign Relations Committee voted 16-2 last November to send
him to the tiny European nation of Luxembourg.
</P>
<P>
   But then a number of Republicans, including Inhofe, Bob Smith of
New Hampshire and Tim Hutchinson of Arkansas, employed Senate rules
to block full consideration of the nominee.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate could override those objections with 60 votes if Lott
chooses to bring the matter up.

WORLD CUP WAS DISASTER FOR U.S.
</HEADLINE>
 STATES-LADN (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT FRENCH  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LENS, France _ Debate on how well, or how poorly, the United
States' adventure in France went rages on, with two schools of
thought dominating the discussion:
</P>
<P>
   The Americans' World Cup performance a) was horrible, a complete
disaster, terrible enough to bring an end to Steve Sampson's reign
as coach and several players' international careers; or b)
demonstrated the progress American soccer has made over the past
four years and was, all in all, a success.
</P>
<P>
   The truth, this time, probably doesn't lie somewhere in between:
No matter how hard Sampson and U.S. Soccer officials try to place a
positive spin on Yanks' showing in France, it appears obvious to
everyone that this was an unmitigated disaster.
</P>
<P>
   By the end, after the losses to Germany, Iran and Yugoslavia
left the Americans the second-worst squad in the 32-team field,
team unity was shattered, the most respected players were openly
ripping into their coach, and Sampson was ready to issue
``significant'' fines and banish star players from ever wearing the
stars and stripes again.
</P>
<P>
   Whether he'll get the chance to make such determinations won't
be known for at least another month, until Alan Rothenberg and his
cronies make official their decision on the future of the national
team, but in a news conference that followed Thursday night's 1-0
loss to Yugoslavia, U.S. Soccer's president certainly made it sound
like there was little doubt what would come next.
</P>
<P>
   Rothenberg talked of two jobs ``to be filled by U.S. Soccer,''
one of them the national team coaching position. And Sampson, who
has been adamant that he should not be fired, acknowledged Friday
that he'd like the other job, as director of Project 2010 --- the
program designed to make the United States a world soccer power
within 12 years --- should he be released.
</P>
<P>
   ``If (U.S. Soccer) considers (failure in France was) a matter of
poor execution by the players,'' he said, ``I think they should
retain me. They have every reason to dismiss me if they think it is
a case of poor preparation or tactics.''
</P>
<P>
   Several of his players, most prominently three-time World Cup
veterans Eric Wynalda and Tab Ramos and 1994 Cup star Alexi Lalas,
have charged that Sampson and his staff are at fault for the poor
performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The World Cup was not about the U.S. national team, it was
about Steve Sampson trying to prove his worth,'' Wynalda told the
San Diego Union-Tribune on the eve of the game with Yugoslavia.
``He wanted to prove he didn't need experience and he didn't need
anybody or anything.''
</P>
<P>
   The turning point, clearly, was Sampson's decision to drop
captain John Harkes from the squad just before the April 22 match
against Austria in Vienna, a 3-0 U.S. rout that cemented a 3-6-1
(defenders-midfielders-forwards) alignment and relegated several
established players, including Lalas and Marcelo Balboa, to the
bench. At the time, it seemed to answer lingering questions about
the team, shoring up its porous defense, utilizing a wealth of
talent in midfield, and taking advantage of its speed on the wings
without surrendering defense.
</P>
<P>
   But the results in the preparation matches that followed weren't
so impressive, and the squad suffered from stage fright in the
disastrous first half against the Germans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Steve made all his decisions based on the Austria
game,'' said Ramos, who overcame two major knee surgeries to earn a
spot on the 22-man roster. ``That might have been a fluke for all
we know.''
</P>
<P>
   Harkes' departure, for ``leadership'' issues and declining
performance, also appeared to give the team a lift, providing
playmaker Claudio Reyna the responsibility to take charge in
midfield. Several veterans say the loss of Harkes proved a major
blow to the team's chemistry.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as I'm concerned,'' Wynalda said, ``when (Sampson) cut
John Harkes, he tore the heart out of the team and threw it on the
floor and expected us to pick up the pieces.''
</P>
<P>
   The loss was amplified when Reyna, often fragile against
physical foes, struggled through the World Cup; the attack
suffered, managing just one goal --- a Brian McBride header that
squeezed past an Iranian defender late in the second game --- in
the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Sampson says the criticism was sour grapes by players whose
playing time had diminished, and veterans' objection to the coach's
reliance on ``inexperienced'' players flails in the face of the
performances by World Cup debutants Frankie Hejduk, Eddie Pope,
Brian Maisonneuve and David Regis, the four best U.S. players in
France.
</P>
<P>
   Sampson, who repeatedly has claimed his team showed vast
improvement over the 1994 World Cup, when it reached the knockout
phase, that it ``achieved our goal of showing we've grown as a
soccer-playing nation,'' said the Americans performed well in five
of the six halves they participated but were victims to poor
finishing.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether they had learned any lessons in France, he
replied: ``Of course. The first half against Germany was probably
the greatest learning experience for us. Very quickly we had to
learn to wake up to the level of soccer at the World Cup, how
important it is to be together on and off the field, and how
important it is to finish your chances --- goal-scoring
opportunities are not easily created in world championships.''
</P>
<P>
   That is the core of what went wrong for the United States. They
had one pathetic half --- the first 45 minutes against Germany ---
but yielded few outstanding scoring chances to their opponents in
any of the three games. Had they been able to find the net,
especially against Iran (against whom they hit the post or crossbar
three times), the results might have been different and 1998 might
be thought a success rather than abysmal failure.
</P>
<P>
   But 0-3, 31st place and rampant dissension adds up to anything
but success.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a tremendous disappointment ... a nightmare,'' Lalas
said when it was over. ``There has to be some accountability all
around. As players, we have high expectations ... and there were
problems that have to be addressed. I'm sure there will be
assessments, critiques and probably criticism for a long time to
come.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Wynalda: ``I don't think people should focus on this being
a catastrophe, because it isn't. It's a wakeup call in a sense,
that we need to know what to do when we get here.''
</P>
<P>
   This time, the Americans didn't know.

US CRITICIZES CHINA OVER DISSIDENT ROUNDUP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MCGRORY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ As President Clinton prepared for his visit to
Tiananmen Square, White House officials lashed out at Chinese
authorities Friday for their abrupt roundup of several dissidents
at the outset of the summit. Once again, they said, the issue of
human rights proved to be an unbridgeable gulf separating the two
sides.
</P>
<P>
   Early Friday, Clinton directed the United States ambassador to
China, James Sasser, to lodge an official protest with the Beijing
government. The move was followed by similar protests from national
security adviser Samuel (Sandy) Berger and other aides to their
counterparts in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are not debris to be swept up for a visit, and we have
expressed our concern about this to the Chinese government,'' said
Berger in a meeting with reporters Friday afternoon in Xian.
``Their response so far has not been terribly satisfactory. They
dispute the facts or otherwise explain these incidents away.''
</P>
<P>
   In more pointed language later, Berger added, ``China's human
rights record is terrible. China is an authoritarian nation. There
has been some progress on human rights, but it has not been nearly
enough. In the area of public dissent, they are still totally
unacceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   Robin Munro, the head of Asia Watch, a human rights group, put
the first two days in a broader perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a good start, but it is good that the president is
experiencing first-hand the hard line that the Chinese government
takes against its dissidents,'' Munro said. ``The Chinese have a
saying that it is better to see something once than to hear about
it 100 times. If this does not result in action rather than just
words, than one must really start to question the whole dialogue
process.''
</P>
<P>
   Human rights groups said that Chinese authorities detained at
least three dissidents on Wednesday and Thursday, as Clinton and
his massive entourage arrived in the country to an elaborate
welcoming pageant in the city of Xian. While the location of the
dissidents was unknown Friday, it was widely believed that they
were being held in jail.
</P>
<P>
   US officials at first seemed reticent to address word of the
roundup. Clinton, for example, silently walked past a reporter
Thursday night who asked for his reaction. By Friday, though,
Clinton and his senior aides, with an eye toward the American
audience, appeared comfortable acknowledging the situation and
criticizing the Chinese government for it. Still, they took pains
to avoid the impression that the roundup was intended by the
Chinese as a direct affront to Clinton and his quest for improved
human rights in this country.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will not distract from the atmosphere of the trip,'' said
Sasser in a brief interview at a remote village event Friday. ``The
president and the country will be seeing a lot of China, both good
and bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Prior to the elaborate welcoming ceremony, which took place on
Tiananmen Square and moved to the Great Hall of the People, White
House officials were visibly anxious. Rare are the moments in a
president's day -- and especially those on diplomatic tour -- that
are not scripted to the most minute detail. But this ceremony, and
the statements that followed it, veered toward the unrehearsed.
</P>
<P>
   The ceremony had already attracted the disdain of congressional
Republicans and human rights advocates, who argued that by
appearing on Tiananmen Square, Clinton was effectively overlooking
the actions of Chinese authorities from June &UR;  &LR; 4, 1989, when troops
killed hundreds, perhaps thousands, of democracy protesters.
Clinton has argued that protocol required him to appear on the
square.
</P>
<P>
   Other parts of the trip did not appear to be proceeding
particularly well for the US delegation either. Unlike most
summits, where agreements and treaties are prearranged weeks in
advance and are presented for a world audience when leaders meet,
officials were still unclear Friday what, if anything, would be
concluded from today's two meetings between Clinton and Chinese
President Jiang Zemin. Indeed, officials seemed to take pains to
downplay prospects for any breakthroughs.
</P>
<P>
   Berger said Clinton would raise human rights issues with Jiang,
but added, ``I would not anticipate that we would see the fruits of
those discussions while we're here.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials said that even a largely symbolic agreement for the
two countries to reposition nuclear missiles away from each other
appeared unlikely to be resolved, largely because the US would not
accept a doctrine of no first strike. Even if such a pact were
reached, the two countries could retarget their weapons at each
other in a matter of minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a confidence-building measure and a statement
about the evolution of our relationship, since adversaries point
their missiles against each other and not countries that are
working to build a better relationship,'' Berger said.
</P>
<P>
   The one apparent agreement Friday was an offer by US officials
to provide Chinese judges, lawyers and legal officials guidance and
training in rules of law, with a particular focus on personal
rights rather than property rights.
</P>
<P>
   White House aides had hoped that Chinese authorities would allow
Clinton's Monday address on US-China relations at Peking University
to be broadcast live throughout the country, as did George Bush
during his visit to China in February 1989. But Friday, Chinese
leaders refused to say whether they would allow an uncensored
national broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best of all worlds would be to have the address carried
live so that the people of China can hear it, and I think there is
sufficient demand in China for it if anyone is going to make the
judgment based on news value,'' said White House spokesman Michael
McCurry.

<TEXT>
<P>
   CORNWALL, Ontario _ There is no mistaking Ron Martelle. He is a
big man with ties as loud as his voice and a white truck with the
license plate ``Wy Earp.''
</P>
<P>
   Martelle, 55, might be familiar to some television viewers in
the United States because he recorded a commercial for the American
tobacco industry's campaign against higher cigarette taxes.
</P>
<P>
   In the spot, he described himself as a former Mountie who
happened to be mayor of this straight-shooting town on the banks of
the St. Lawrence River when Canada sharply raised tobacco taxes a
few years ago, turning Cornwall into what he called Dodge City.
</P>
<P>
   ``Smugglers were everywhere,'' he said in the ad, his baritone
deep as a well. ``And I'm not talking about small-time dealers
selling packs out of their trunks. The criminals that showed up in
Cornwall threatened my life and the lives of my family.''
</P>
<P>
   Martelle has urged the U.S. Congress not to go ahead with a plan
to raise taxes sharply to curb cigarette smoking among teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd hate to see the same thing happen to your town,'' he said.
``If it can happen here, it can happen anywhere.'' (Last week,
after the tax plan failed to win the necessary support, the Senate
shelved it indefinitely.)
</P>
<P>
   There is no telling what influence Martelle's performance has
had in the United States, but that 60-second spot has caused as
many ripples here as a northeaster over the St. Lawrence.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the 47,000 people who live in Cornwall say Martelle is
exaggerating, just as, in their view, he had tended to blow things
out of proportion during more than five years he was mayor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ron gave the impression that Cornwall was a city under siege,
but it wasn't,'' said Brian Lynch, himself a former mayor of
Cornwall and now executive director of the local office of Big
Brothers, the organization that helps young boys. He remembered
that the Cornwall City Council once voted to censure Martelle
because some members were ``appalled by the false image he gave of
the community.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after taxes on Canadian cigarettes were raised sharply
in 1992, large quantities of cigarettes left the country, but most
were almost immediately smuggled back into Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Antismoking forces accuse the Canadian tobacco companies, which
include subsidiaries of American tobacco companies, of deliberately
conspiring with smugglers to flood the market with cheaper
cigarettes on which all the taxes have not been collected.
</P>
<P>
   The tobacco companies deny any complicity. ``There isn't a shred
of evidence to support that,'' said Robert Parker, president of the
Canadian Tobacco Manufacturers' Council. ``The accusation has been
made as part of a push to raise taxes in the U.S.''
</P>
<P>
   On a sunny summer day, when the big, easy, waterfront park in
Cornwall is ruled by gangs of joggers and bicycling French-speaking
women from Quebec, it is difficult to picture this as Martelle's
Dodge City.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no question that before Canada lowered taxes to
previous levels in 1994, cigarette smuggling had changed the
character of this Ontario town near the borders of the province of
Quebec and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you came into Cornwall then, you could go into any bar,
take any taxi, go up to any gas station attendant and ask where to
buy smuggled cigarettes,'' said Cpl. Michel Joulet, who headed the
antismuggling unit in the Royal Canadian Mounted Police's Cornwall
detachment from 1990 to 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The smuggling worked this way: Cigarettes were made in Canada
and exported _ without local taxes _ into the United States. These
cigarettes have different names (du Maurier, Player's), different
packaging (long, flat boxes) and even a different taste that most
American smokers have never accepted.
</P>
<P>
   It was always clear that most of the Canadian exports would not
be sold in the United States. Many were brought to warehouses on
the Akwesasne Mohawk Indian Reserve near Cornwall and sent back
across the St. Lawrence into Canada at prices about half as high as
fully taxed cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   Smuggling increased the level of violence in the otherwise quiet
city. Many people, including Joulet, agree that it was not uncommon
to hear gunshots along the river at night. For a time, private
boats simply did not venture out on the river. High-speed chases
across the international bridge at the west end of town were
common, and someone once fired a shot into Cornwall's community
center.
</P>
<P>
   How bad was it? ``Bad,'' said Cerdan Lager, owner of Cornwall's
Downtown Diner, an old-fashioned restaurant and ice cream parlor
with booths and red-checkered tablecloths where Martelle's
commercial was filmed. ``Shooting at houses, everything. So when
Ron talks, he talks.''
</P>
<P>
   But when Martelle talks, his opponents are ready with
counterattacks. They point out that although he calls himself a
former Mountie, he was in the force for only eight months. When he
says he and his family had to have police protection, they say he
was taken to a local motel based only on vague threats.
</P>
<P>
   They explain that in the original version of the commercial,
Martelle says that even with the taxes and all the violence, ``teen
smoking didn't ever go down,'' a statement challenged by opponents
of smoking. In a revised version, he said, ``And as a result, teens
purchased black-market cigarettes.''
</P>
<P>
   They also delight in pointing out that the company Martelle now
works for, Forensic Investigative Associates of Toronto, represents
the National Coalition Against Crime and Tobacco Contraband, a
lobby group for tobacco wholesalers, retailers and the major
cigarette producers in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Martelle said he had filmed the commercial as former mayor of
Cornwall, not as an employee of Forensic Investigative Associates,
and he defends his message.
</P>
<P>
   ``I deal in facts and facts only,'' he said, seated in the
smoking section of a restaurant at the hotel where he and his wife
were kept under police guard for several days in 1993. He smokes
long boxes of Sweet Caporal cigarettes, but he did not smoke during
the interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dodge City was an accurate portrayal of what was happening at
the time,'' he said. ``I'm trying to forewarn U.S. officials and
every city in the U.S. that if taxes go up, I'd bet they're going
to suffer what we did here in Cornwall. In fact, I guarantee it's
going to happen.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Several Cornwall residents have already been convicted of
smuggling. Three big operators were given the largest fines in
Canadian history _ the equivalent of $31.5 million apiece _ based
on the taxes the Canadian government lost because of the trio's
4,000 case-per-week smuggling activities.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, several Mohawk Indians have been indicted in the
United States on charges of using the Akwesasne Indian Reserve,
across the St. Lawrence from Cornwall, as a base for cigarette and
alcohol smuggling. And another Indian band has threatened to block
roads through its reserve in Quebec if the provincial government
insists on collecting taxes on cigarettes sold there.
</P>
<P>
   While the smuggling has diminished, it has not disappeared.
Stray shots still ring out on the river at night, and the Mounties
are still occasionally involved in police chases over the
international bridge.
</P>
<P>
   One recent afternoon, Martelle drove by the bridge and spotted a
damaged police cruiser being hauled onto a flatbed truck.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll bet it was a chase with smugglers,'' he said, craning his
neck.
</P>
<P>
   It turned out to have been just a traffic accident.

SAMPSON VOWS TO FINE CRITICAL PLAYERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT FRENCH  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LENS, France _ U.S. national soccer team coach Steve Sampson
promised Friday that players who had publicly criticized him during
the World Cup could expect ``significant'' fines and would never
play for him again if he continues as coach, an increasingly
unlikely scenario.
</P>
<P>
   General Manager Tom King said ``two or three'' players would be
fined, and Reuters reported that Alexi Lalas, Tab Ramos and Jeff
Agoos would be penalized. All three, critical of their coach's
personnel decisions in France, have said they wouldn't play again
for Sampson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think any level of unprofessionalism is acceptable,''
Sampson said Friday from the team's camp in Pornic, singling out
Ramos' comments following Thursday's loss to Yugoslavia. ``It's
unfortunate he feels so free to voice his opinions about me when I
have given him so much repsect and credit.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramos was highly critical Thursday, saying, ``From the
beginning, the whole World Cup has been a mess. We showed at times
we're a good team, but overall I blame the coaches for the losses.
I don't have a problem saying that.''

   Of Lalas, Sampson said: ``His professionalism was top class, but
his mood once we lost (to Germany in the opener) changed
dramatically.''
</P>
<P>
   Preki Radosavljevic, who railed against Sampson for not
including him in the starting lineup against Yugoslavia, also may
be disciplined, Reuters reported, but there was no word on what
sanctions may await Eric Wynalda, who also condemned the coach.

   The amount of the fines hasn't been determined, but Sampson said
they would be informed by post ``over the next few days.''

THE LAWYER AND THE COLUMNIST 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One way that I think of Mike Barnicle is as the guy who replaced
me on the ``The News Hour'' with Jim Lehrer. After giving me a
brief tryout as the Boston voice on its regional panel years ago,
the show went straight to the Globe metro columnist, and he has
been there ever since, a great success. There as elsewhere, he is
Boston Mike.
</P>
<P>
   Barnicle today is probably the second best pure newsman in
Boston, after Eileen McNamara (the paper's other metro columnist),
not counting Will McDonough, who covers sports. On a wide range of
topics, Barnicle is the go-to guy _ when you absolutely,
positively, have got to know what happened on one of his beats.
(There are some conspicuous exceptions, but I'll come to that.)
</P>
<P>
   His name got dragged through the mud last week, thanks to
Harvard Law School professor and defense attorney Alan Dershowitz,
who compared Barnicle to Patricia Smith, a third Globe metro
columnist whose resignation was sought and received after the paper
discovered she had fabricated material for her columns. In a series
of faxes, the Harvard professor accused the Globe of maintaining a
double standard.
</P>
<P>
   Dershowitz's attack was low, deceptive, and, up to a point,
effective. It forced the newspaper to mount a defense of a man who
for eight years had been accused of nothing much more serious than
a parking violation. &UR;  &LR; It impugned the newspaper's handling of a
very painful problem.
</P>
<P>
   The proximate reason for Dershowitz's complaint was Barnicle's
attribution to him in 1990 of a remark made in 1982: ``I love Asian
women, don't you? They're...they're so submissive.'' Barnicle said
the quote had been recalled from a chance sidewalk conversation of
eight years earlier; it was injected into a column about a feud
between Dershowitz and Barnicle's friend William Bulger, then the
Senate president.
</P>
<P>
   Dershowitz denied ever having said it. He threatened mightily,
eventually reaching a resolution of the matter with the
newspaper &UR;  &LR; _ thereby avoiding the process of mutual discovery that
would have shed light on the question of whether the youthful Dersh
had been racist, sexist, or, in his own words, a potential
adulterer, or Barnicle a liar.
</P>
<P>
   The statute of limitations on complaints like this one ran out
long ago. Barnicle has been writing his column for 25 years. It is
the hardest job on the paper.
</P>
<P>
   It was in 1973 that Barnicle was recruited by Globe political
columnist Bob Healy and editor Tom Winship to be groomed to replace
legendary columnist George Frazier. ``His column will start in the
Evening Globe as soon as he learns to type,'' said the
announcement. Before that he had booted around Washington for a few
years as a Capitol cop, an elevator operator, speechwriter, and
screenwriter _ Robert Redford's ``The Candidate'' was partly of his
devising.
</P>
<P>
   Having never been apprenticed as a reporter, the boy writer had
a rough enough time of it in the 1970s before he began to settle
down. He was accused of ventriloquism, borrowing (by Mike Royko
regularly), and even fabrication. He denied it all and went on
turning out columns that firmly established him as the newspaper's
premier stylist.
</P>
<P>
   For Barnicle had the sine qua non, the inimitable voice of the
city. Born in Worcester, Mass., he grew up it Fitchburg, went to
school at Boston University, when it was still a loose
confederation of Methodist schools. Having lived in Washington and
New York, he returned to Boston to make a living. He understood the
city in its most intimate particulars: its tribal loyalities, sense
of humor, smoldering rage. Founded in 1630, Boston's motto even
today is, ``We wouldn't tell you if your shirt-tail was on fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnicle is about nothing if not connections. He has friends and
fans in every conceivable part of the city. It helps that he has a
brother who is an influential Boston homicide detective. It helps,
too, that his wife is the advertising and public relations chieftan
for a major bank, and that they live with their children _ his,
hers, theirs _ in Lincoln, Boston's single fanciest suburb. But he
commutes most days to Dorchester, Cambridge, Roxbury, and every
other corner of the city.
</P>
<P>
   There he hangs out with cops, often being taken for one, which
helps him get his juiciest quotes. He takes batting practice with
the Red Sox in Florida, haunts park benches and newsstands, goes to
enough wakes to qualify as a professional mourner. He moves easily
in a city where the Senate president's brother was the town's top
mobster and where the confidence, and even the protection, of the
local office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation may have
extended to each.
</P>
<P>
   Boston, remember, is not Chicago or New York; Massachusetts is
one of the few states in the union where the political capital was
not long ago moved away from the commercial center as as way of
cutting down on temptation.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, Barnicle had character and grit. He learned,
experimented with forms, discrarding some, retaining others, a
pocket O. Henry one year, the reincarnation of Jimmy Cannon the
next. He raised the bar, like a weak-gloved ball player who batted
.245, .270, then finally .305. And so he became a star, adding a
regular gig on ``Chronicle,'' a nightly television news magazine
show; mixing it up between times with Don Imus on the radio in the
morning, on the MSNBC cable network at night. He is Boston Mike, a
man who grew into his role.
</P>
<P>
   For 15 years or so, Barnicle regularly has hit the newspaper
equivalent of .300, improving his fielding at least to average (if
not exactly Golden Glove), playing a lot, and participating in many
of the biggest games. He writes three times a week. When he is not
reporting (or raising kids), he turns out a mix of sentiment,
shrewd observation, and one-liners with flashes of wonderful
writing. (He once described a certain politician as being ``cuter
than his baby pictures.'') He is too loyal to his friends, too
tough on his enemies, but then that is just another Boston trait.
He is not Breslin, not Hamill, not Cannon, not Caen, not Royko. He
is not DiMaggio either, nor Mays, nor Mantle: more like Duke
Snider, with some Carl Yastrzemski thrown in on the side.
</P>
<P>
   (If Patty Smith had had the same help as Barnicle, she might
have made it here too, though I doubt it. Her orientation to news
was too weak; her orientation to Boston nonexistent. She was a
Chicago woman through and through. And she came to her newspaper
column 20 years after Barnicle, in more-demanding, less-forgiving
times).
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Fifty years ago, Boston was called ``the poor farm of American
journalism,'' and deservedly so. But the economics of the business
changed, and thanks to the Globe's Taylor family and Tom Winship,
and secondarily to Rupert Murdoch &UR;  &LR; (when he owned the Boston
Herald), Pat Purcell (who does now), and Don Forst (a highly
regarded former Herald editor), Boston became one of four or five
centers of journalism in the country. At the top of the heap are
city columnists like Barnicle, Howie Carr, Shelley Cohen, Margery
Eagan, Peter Gelzinis, Ellen Goodman, Alan Lupo, Christopher Lydon,
Eileen McNamara, Brian Mooney, Martin F. Nolan, David Nyhan, and
Joan Vennochi. Boston journalisam is still famously eccentric, but
it has become nationally first rate, perhaps even the best in the
nation. No organization has had more to do with this than the
Globe.
</P>
<P>
   I bring all this up to call attention to the source &UR;  &LR; of last
week's midslinging against Barnicle.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is that Harvard Law School, where Alan Dershowitz hangs
his hat, has been a far more troubled place in recent years than
has the Globe. First it was the ``crits,'' a band of legal
nihilists whose shenanigans turned faculty meetings into
battlefields. Then there was an ongoing controversy over the
school's inability to appoint female and minority professors. &UR;  &LR; And
of course there is the unsolved murder of Mary Jo Frug, whose
husband, Gerald, is a law school professor. The police
investigation of her death was hindered and hushed through a
combination of legal bluster and arrogance &UR;  &LR; from a circle and
friends from the law school.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  And through it all there was the man his students know as
``the Dersh,'' flamboyantly representing a series of famous
clients: Claus von Bulow, O.J. Simpson, Louise Woodward,
proclaiming all the while that here was the heart of the legal
system.
</P>
<P>
   Granted that a professional school does not seek to impose the
same tight scrum of ethical conduct on its members as does a a
newspaper. Granted, too, that Dean Robert Clark has calmed it down
and cleaned it up; the Harvard Law School has ceased to be a
circus. And Alan Dershowitz is a fine defense attorney. He
criticizes the powerful without fear or favor. He has proven he
came hold a grudge with the best of them.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; But Dershowitz throwing rocks at The Boston Globe from the
shelter of Hauser Hall is still a spectacle. We do a better job
maintaining our standards and ventilating our problems here at the
newspaper than they do over there.

CLINTON SEEKS `PROTECTIVE' PRIVILEGE FOR SECRET SERVICE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration tried Friday to convince
three skeptical appeals court judges to create a new privilege that
would allow Secret Service officers to avoid disclosing what they
know about the president's relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Claiming that presidents would keep their protectors at an
unsafe distance if they can be compelled to testify about what they
see or hear on the job, Justice Department lawyer Stephen Preston
urged the three-judge panel to overturn an order requiring Secret
Service employees to testify before a grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   ``This case is about the safety of the president and what is
necessary in the judgment of the Secret Service to protect him from
assassination,'' said Preston, who argued for the protective
service and its parent agency, the Treasury Department.
</P>
<P>
   The agencies want the courts to recognize a ``protective
function privilege,'' much like executive privilege and
attorney-client privilege. Preston said the new privilege would be
invoked by the Treasury secretary, not the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you're asking for sounds bizarre,'' Judge Douglas
Ginsburg said during a series of comments and questions that at
times left Preston groping for a response.
</P>
<P>
   Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr, a former solicitor general
and member of the appeals court considering the case, urged the
judges _ all Republican appointees _ to leave intact an order
requiring Secret Service agents to testify.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is evidence of wrongdoing, that evidence must be
reported,'' Starr said, citing a federal law that governs the
behavior of law enforcement officials, including Secret Service
agents.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is whether Secret Service officers Gary Byrne and Brian
Henderson and agency lawyer John Kelleher must answer questions
before a federal grand jury investigating whether President Clinton
engaged in a cover-up of his alleged sexual indiscretions with
Lewinsky, a former White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Lewinsky have denied under oath that they had a
sexual relationship. Clinton has publicly denied having sex with
Lewinsky or urging her to lie about it.
</P>
<P>
   As part of his case, Starr wants to show that Clinton and
Lewinsky met alone at the White House, and the prosecutor has
asserted that Secret Service agents have information to support
that contention.
</P>
<P>
   Starr argued that if the Secret Service needed an exemption from
testifying in criminal cases, the agency should ask Congress to
pass a law and not seek a court ruling for which there is no
precedent.
</P>
<P>
   Starr pointed out that the Clinton administration's position is
inconsistent with past practices. The prosecutor referred to the
agency's willingness to provide Congress with information about the
whereabouts of President Bush. When congressional investigators
wanted to check out claims that he was abroad, Secret Service
officials testified that he was playing tennis in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't it odd for a law enforcement agency to willingly testify
(only) when it helps the president,'' Starr said. ``But if the
testimony could hurt him, (agents) will not provide it or he will
push them away.''
</P>
<P>
   Ginsburg, Randolph and Judge Stephen Williams, who a month ago
agreed to quickly review and decide the Secret Service privilege
case, ended the hearing with no indication of how they would rule.
Their decision is expected to be appealed to the full 11-judge
court, then to the Supreme Court.

GM, UAW LOCKED IN CONTEST FOR SURVIVAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN WILMSEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FLINT, Mich. _ It doesn't look much like the bitter dispute it
is said to be. The mood of striking General Motors autoworkers,
gathered in a ragged knot near the vast, empty parking lot of GM's
hulking metal fabrication plant, is almost congenial. They hoist
the usual signs, wave at passing traffic, amiably receive the
occassional honk of support. They apply sun screen and eat fried
chicken. All in a day's work in this eminently union town.
</P>
<P>
   There is little to betray what labor experts say is really going
on: The death struggle of two aging Titans, GM and the United Auto
Workers union, engaging in what each believes is a final contest
for survival.
</P>
<P>
   The strike, now beginning its fourth week, has all but closed
down the automaker's North American operations, idling nearly
150,000 workers and costing the company $40 million a day. GM has a
long history of meeting union demands. But top management has vowed
to break the lock of UAW contracts in order to compete with Ford
and Chrysler, which won big concessions during the auto recession
of the 1980's.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to carve out the heart of the UAW and pursue it to
destruction,'' says Sean McAlinden, a research scientist at the
University of Michigan's Office for the Study of Automotive
transportation. ``There's real hatred here.''
</P>
<P>
   And the union knows it. With roughly half the membership of a
decade ago and a string of lost labor battles, the union's power _
once among the most feared forces in American commerce _ has
palpably slipped. Now, labor experts say, this strike will decide
not only whether workers can squeeze concessions from GM, but
whether the union can ever restore lost power.
</P>
<P>
   And there is a larger theme to the confrontation, labor experts
say: A struggle to make unions relevent in an age &UR;  &LR; of prosperity
and disappearing blue-collar jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is that it just doesn't matter to the public the way
it used to,'' McAlinden says. ``It doesn't even matter to the
union's rank and file the way it used to.''
</P>
<P>
   Workers at GM's Flint Metal Center walked out June 5 after the
company refused to hire more staff and replace broken-down
equipment. A week later, in keeping with a union strategy to
disrupt the release of a new line of pickups, employees at a parts
factory across town joined the strike. Without parts to work with,
26 of GM's 29 assembly plants nationwide were idled. forcing the
company to lay off more than 146,000 workers.
</P>
<P>
   Although GM traditionally has refrained from airing grievances
with the union in public, the company has lashed out against the
UAW this time around. In announcements and interviews, GM
complained that workers in Flint, protected by layers of union
contracts, are among the nation's slowest yet highest paid. GM even
set up a toll-free hotline with a taped union brow-beating by vice
president Donald E. Hackworth.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; On Thursday, the company said it may drop car lines and
permanently close some North American plants, hinting that the
escalating fight is forcing it to decide the fate of marginal
operations sooner rather than later.
</P>
<P>
   That the company would even speak out ``is historic,'' said Bill
Donohue, a former priest who on behalf of local business leaders
has tried to broker compromises between the union and GM. ``Those
guys never do anything like that.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, GM's public attacks have prompted little reaction from
striking workers, most of whom won't bear the brunt of future job
cuts. Thanks to UAW contracts, most will retire with full pensions,
and even those who are laid off are guaranteed 70 percent of their
base pay. Many now lead financially secure lives, and some view the
negotiations as a political squabble.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like they're sticking knives in each other. I don't know
how productive that is,'' Richard Andrykovich, a stamping plant
pipefitter told the Fint Journal.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the strike so far has failed to capture the nation's
attention in the way auto strikes of a decade ago did. One reason
is the sheer number of walkouts has numbed public sympathy, labor
experts say. In the past 30 months, UAL locals have staged 23
strikes against GM alone.
</P>
<P>
   It may also be that the country's working sensibilities have
shifted as high-tech giants like Microsoft and Intel have
overshadowed union struggles, making them seem like epic dramas of
a bygone era.
</P>
<P>
   Some observers say it is fitting that the confrontation is
playing out in Flint, the birthplace of both GM and the UAW. Union
officials have even compared the current walkout with the historic
Depression-era sit-down strike in Flint that forced GM to recognize
the union in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Flint is one of the nation's best examples of how manufacturing
giants like GM and powerful unions like the UAW grew up together
and forged comfortable middle-class lives for thousands of
laborors. But GM's retreat from Flint beginning in the 1980s,
cutting jobs from 77,000 in 1978 to 33,000 now, has been
devastating.
</P>
<P>
   While city leaders say the economy is diversifying, block after
block of boarded storefronts, weeded lots and vacant or sparsely
inhabited downtown buildings remain decayed reminders of the city's
dependence on GM _ and on the fading era of life ``at the plant.''
</P>
<P>
   Blame for Flint's slide has in the past rested squarely on GM,
whose profits remained high while it laid off workers. Increasingly
though, Flint's business leaders point the finger at the union,
which they say has made labor so expensive that the company is left
with few choices but to leave. Working with GM to reduce costs,
they say, might at least salvage some of what is left of the
company's Flint presence.
</P>
<P>
   GM says it has the highest costs of any automaker in the
country, a fact it blames on UAW. It's share of the US car market
has slipped from 50 percent to barely more than 30 percent. It says
its metal fabrication plant loses $50 million a year while some
workers are allowed to work half-days while getting paid full-time
wages. The company says the plant's average worker makes $98,000
annually including benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you expect the company to pay the highest wages in the
world for four hours of work and still keep jobs in Flint?''
Donohue says. ``The union doesn't have a business strategy. It gets
what it wants and it gets it by force. Nobody in America works that
way anymore. It's crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the city remains one of the nation's most militantly
pro-union towns, there are signs some of UAW's iron-grip power is
flagging in Flint. A recent survey by the local Mott Foundation
found just 20 percent of county residents viewed UAW favorably.
Flint Mayor Woodrow Stanley, in a move that would have amounted to
political suicide even a few years ago, defied union requests to
come out in favor of the strike.
</P>
<P>
   As for the outcome of the current showdown, no resolution is &UR;  &LR; in
sight. Talks between the union and GM have stalled, and the strike
appears destined to extend well into the summer. Though the strike
could cost GM as much as $300 million a week, analysts say the
company can afford to wait the union out.
</P>
<P>
   But few go so far as to predict UAW's demise. Its ranks still
include a healthy core of die-hard loyalists like Larry Gauthier, a
union representative who said his father, a pipefitter, told him
stories of the original sit-down strike.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what the union has done for the country,'' he said
recently, while taking a turn on the picket line. ``Nothing could
stop me from being a proud part of this.''
</P>
<P>
   Labor experts say that for the union to survive in the long run,
however, it must fill a slightly different role.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've still got a social job to do,'' says the University of
Michigan's McAlinden. ``They've got to be more actively involved in
the training of workers, in keeping them able to handle a quickly
changing work place. They've got to work on striking new kinds of
deals. The leadership knows that, but their hands are tied. There
are still too many people who want things done the old way.''

STANDARD &AMP; POOR 500 INDEX HITS RECORD HIGH
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By DAVID BARBOZA     
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The stock market finished a strong week Friday as
blue-chip issues rode into record territory despite longstanding
fears about the economic crisis in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street analysts continue to warn about a slowdown in
corporate profits this year, partly because of Asia, but investors
are sending most of the major stock indexes significantly higher.
</P>
<P>
   After falling sharply just over a week ago, dropping nearly 5
percent below its record high, the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 stock
index soared this week to a record 1,133.20 Friday, pushing the
index up nearly 16.8 percent for the year.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average also gained, rising 231.67
points, or 2.7 percent this week, to close at 8,944.54, about 3
percent below its record of 9,211.84, set on May 13.
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks were even stronger, led by Microsoft, which
soared about 10 percent this week after a federal appeals court
made a ruling in Microsoft's favor in the company's dispute with
the government over competition issues. The composite index of the
Nasdaq stock market, where Microsoft trades, gained 88.24 points,
or 4.9 percent, on the week to close at 1,869.53.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in the midst of a summer rally,'' said Harvey
Hirschhorn, the chief investment strategist at Stein Roe &AMP; Farnham
in Chicago. ``The market had been oversold for a while, but we're
seeing a lot of support from the bond market, where yields are at a
decades-long low.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, bond prices soared again Friday, dropping the yield on
the benchmark 30-year bond to 5.63 percent, close to its lowest
level in nearly 30 years. Inflation fears continue to diminish, and
a flood of cheap imports from Asia promises to keep prices low,
traders believe.
</P>
<P>
   As for share prices, Friday's gains were meager, just 8.96
points on the Dow and 3.92 points in the S&AMP;P 500. But the weekly
gains were an impressive show of confidence after months of seesaw
trading over concerns that a slowdown in Asia would curb corporate
profits.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the Asian worries, a steady flow of government reports
depicting a vibrant American economy, with lower interest rates and
soaring consumer confidence, has put investors in a jubilant mood.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, for instance, the government said consumer spending
accelerated in May. That followed a Thursday report that the
economy in the first quarter grew at an annual rate of 5.4 percent,
the second-fastest pace in a decade. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Those kinds of numbers seem to have served as a counterweight to
concerns about slowing profit growth at home, and the prospect of
an even sharper pinch from falling demand for American-made goods
in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street analysts say they believe that investors are
overlooking the profit slowdown and banking on a powerful economy
that will eventually create another wave of hefty profits in the
near future.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent weeks, Wall Street has been subjected to a steady
stream of profit warnings. ``We think the economy is in a profits
recession,'' said Richard Bernstein, the chief quantitative analyst
at Merrill Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Abbott, a research manager at IBES Inc., which tracks
earnings, said that profits for the companies in the S&AMP;P 500 are
projected to rise just 2.6 percent in the current second quarter,
down from double-digit gains a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   And the strike at General Motors plants could cut that figure
even more. Friday, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. lowered his
second-quarter earnings estimate for GM. If profits at GM are
sharply reduced, in line with the Goldman forecast, IBES says
growth in S&AMP;P profits would shrink to just 1.6 percent in the
quarter. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Charles Hill, who compiles forecasts for First Call Inc., said
earnings expectations were falling at a faster-than-normal rate
this quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing more negative pre-announcements,'' he said. ``And
there could be significant disappointments in the third and fourth
quarters. Asia is certainly not going to get better that quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Hirschhorn at Stein Roe projects that profit growth will decline
in the third and fourth quarters largely because of rising wage and
price pressures.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not overly excited about the next 12 to 16 months,'' he
said. ``We've had nirvana, and now we're moving into
post-nirvana.'' &QL;

   SCOTUS-HARASS (Washington) _ The Supreme Court clarified the law
on sexual harassment in the workplace today, making some lawsuits
against employers easier to win while limiting the legal exposure
of companies that have effective anti-harassment policies in place.
The two 7-to-2 decisions cut through a thicket of confusing and
contradictory lower-court rulings that had grown up in the 12 years
since the justices first ruled that sexual harassment was a form of
employment discrimination. By Linda Greenhouse.

   NIRELAND-ELECT (Belfast, Northern Ireland) _ Parties committed
to the Northern Ireland peace settlement emerged winners in the
election for the new Assembly on Friday, but candidates opposed to
the accord won enough seats to call into question the value of that
victory. The results showed that the province's two biggest
parties, the Ulster Unionist Party of David Trimble and the Social
Democratic and Labor Party of John Hume, would get the chance to
fulfill their historic pledge to work together to end the sectarian
conflict. But the ongoing count of the ballots from Thursday's
election, which will not be complete until Saturday, was exposing
deep divisions in Trimble's support as many party members deserted
him to cast their votes for other Protestant candidates wary of

<TEXT>
<P>
   Warren Buffett's announcement this month that his company,
Berkshire Hathaway, was spending $21.7 billion in stock to acquire
General Re was of more than passing interest to investors in one
mutual fund: Sequoia, the $4.8 billion offering that closed to new
investors in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   The fund counts Berkshire Hathaway as its largest holding by
far: 26.4 percent of the portfolio was in Berkshire stock as of
Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   So when Berkshire's class A shares fell 4.2 percent on the
Monday after the acquisition was announced, to $77,500 a share, it
was hardly surprising that Sequoia sagged, too, by 1.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Buffett and the co-managers of Sequoia, William J. Ruane and
Richard T. Cunniff, share more than a common interest in the
performance of Berkshire stock. All are former students of the
grandfather of value investing, Benjamin Graham. Their portfolios
are similar, too.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 16 stocks owned by Sequoia, at least three _ Walt Disney,
Wells Fargo and Freddie Mac _ were also held by Berkshire as of
Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   All of which raises a question: What would Sequoia's performance
have been of late if it weren't for Berkshire? Given that laws
require only infrequent disclosure, the best an outsider could hope
for is a back-of-the-envelope figure.
</P>
<P>
   Using net asset and total return figures from Morningstar Inc.,
the financial publisher in Chicago, the Money and Business section
did a series of calculations to see how the fund's Berkshire
holdings _ which appear to have remained constant _ affected
performance each month from June 1995 through May 1998.
</P>
<P>
   By subtracting the value of the Berkshire stock from total
assets, and the Berkshire-generated growth from total
performance-related growth, the performance of the rest of the
portfolio can be roughly estimated. The figures show Sequoia had an
average annual return of 35.2 percent over the three years.
Excluding Berkshire, the return would have been less: 30.8 percent.
(Berkshire, helped by great year-to-date performance, returned 46
percent.)
</P>
<P>
   Does all this cut the storied Sequoia down to size? Hardly. Its
three-year return, even without Berkshire, was still better than
the 29.5 percent annualized return of the Standard &AMP; Poor's
500-stock index. And Cunniff pointed out that the methodology
assigned all cash to the fund's ex-Berkshire return, hurting its
relative performance in an up market.
</P>
<P>
   But the figures do suggest a way to close in on Sequoia's
returns. Investors could buy an S&AMP;P index fund with half their
money and put the rest into Berkshire stock. ``That's not a bad
idea,'' Cunniff said.

OBSERVERS SEE INCREASE IN SEXUAL HARASSMENT ACTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON AND CHANA SCHOENBERGER   
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The US Supreme Court has opened the door wide for employees who
want to file lawsuits against their employers for sexual
harassment.
</P>
<P>
   Employment lawyers and human resource executives said Friday's
decision would certainly increase the number of harassment
complaints that employees file against their employers in the
future _ and make it easier to win them.
</P>
<P>
   A growing caseload would add to the escalating liability of
employers battling harassment claims, which have risen sharply in
recent years. Employers last year paid nearly $50 million to settle
federal sexual harassment claims, according to the Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission. That is nearly double their cost in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Things will only get worse for employers and better for
employees, experts said in reaction to Friday's decision by the
nation's highest court.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Supreme Court has lowered the bar'' and ``made it easier''
to prove sexual harassment under federal law, said Paul Stanzler,
an employment lawyer and managing partner at Burns &AMP; Levinson in
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Employers in recent years have been under attack by a myriad
harassment decisions, often not in their favor.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's decision is the second this year by the Supreme Court
broadening what constitutes a legitimate claim of sexual
harassment. Justices in March for the first time allowed employees
to file lawsuits claiming same-sex harassment in the workplace.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the latest decision, companies that do not
already have precise procedures for handling complaints of
harassment brought internally by employees, must implement them,
consultants said. That may mean keeping careful records of any
employee who comes to the human resource department to report a
lewd remark or inappropriate behavior by a coworker or boss.
</P>
<P>
   More employers may also be forced to purchase insurance to
protect themselves against harassment complaints, in much the same
as they buy insurance for workers injured on the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``Employers are liable for supervisors' sexual harassment unless
the employers can affirmatively show that they took action to
prevent it,'' said Jody L. Newman, a partner in the Boston law firm
of Dwyer &AMP; Collora who defends sexual harassment victims. ``It's an
improvement, a step in the right direction.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; While ``sexual harassment'' is now a widely recognized term,
individuals who sued employers often stumble in court when asked to
show how they were harmed _ whether fired or passed over for a
promotion or raise _ or if they rebuffed sexual advances or lewd
remarks by a supervisor. Friday's Supreme Court ruling removed that
requirement.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in the Chicago case, Kimberly Ellerth sued her
former employer, Burlington Industries, maintaining that her boss'
boss made comments such as, ``You know, Kim, I could make your life
very hard or very easy at Burlington.'' The court said those
threats, though they were never carried out, create a hostile work
environment that could leave an employer liable.
</P>
<P>
   Many large corporations have strict harassment policies in
place. ``We have a procedure that's clearly understood,'' said
Libby Sartain, whose title at Southwest Airlines is vice president
of people.
</P>
<P>
   But, for employers who do not take harassment claims seriously,
the court's decision ``is a wake-up call to US businesses,'' said
Marilyn Stempler, a partner at Brown Rudnick Freed &AMP; Gesmer in
Boston. The court's message: ``Put policies in place. Have a rapid
response to people who complain, and have a really good reporting
process.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the court's ruling made it more difficult for
employees to bring a lawsuit if they failed to register any
complaints with employers in a timely fashion.
</P>
<P>
   ``That employers can avoid liability if they can show that the
employee failed to complain, is new and extremely significant,''
said Louis A. Rodriques, head of the employment law practice group
at Sullivan &AMP; Worcester in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers said that this new onus on employees pales compared with
the increased ease of making _ and winning a sexual harrassment
case.

COMMENTARY: WHOSE COUNTRY IS IT? 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ZICHRON YAACOV, Israel _ I am sitting in the flowering yard of
my friend Victor Friedman's house, telling him what an idyllic
paradise is his neighborhood in this village overlooking Israel's
coastal plain. On the outside, yes, says Victor, but you have no
idea of the tension just beneath the surface here between Jews and
Jews.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a mixed neighborhood of secular and religious,''
Victor explains. ``The religious here wanted to live in a mixed
neighborhood. But they decided one day they wanted a synagogue in
the neighborhood that would be within walking distance. First they
used a shelter attached to the grocery store. When the neighbors
found out, they threatened to boycott the store unless the owner
closed the synagogue. Then the religious went to the mayor and got
some land zoned for a synagogue and some neighbors stopped that.
Their motto was: `Not in my back yard.' This is Israel _ and people
are blocking synagogues! It's because they're afraid that as soon
as you have a synagogue on your street, the Orthodox will soon
demand that your street be closed on the Sabbath, and then, for the
secular, there goes the neighborhood.''
</P>
<P>
   But Orthodox feel just as besieged by the secular, said Victor.
Jewish-owned shops in Zichron can't open on Saturdays. But recently
a Jewish shopkeeper, every Saturday, ``sold'' his store to a local
Arab and opened for business. Local Orthodox leaders responded by
taking the town hearse and parking it in front of the shop's door,
blocking anyone from entering.
</P>
<P>
   Such scenes are the talk of Israel today, as the rapidly growing
ultra-Orthodox population wrestles for living space with Israel's
secular majority. Last week, when the government announced plans to
absorb some secular towns around Jerusalem into the
Orthodox-dominated Jerusalem municipality, the secular towns fought
it. ``For the first time in history we have Jews fighting not to
live in Jerusalem,'' said the Israeli author Zeev Chafetz. Recently
ultra-Orthodox parties ran an ad campaign: ``One Nation, One
Conversion'' _ meaning only Orthodox conversions should be allowed
in Israel, not Reform or Conservative. Secularists responded with
ads on Israeli buses saying: ``One Nation, One Draft'' _ meaning
the ultra-Orthodox, now exempt from army duty, should be drafted.
</P>
<P>
   The same rage that Israelis once directed at Arabs, secular and
Orthodox Israelis now direct at each other: ``I hate you because
you refuse to recognize me as legitimate and you never let me feel
at home in my own house.''
</P>
<P>
   You can see three types of responses to this cultural war. The
juridical response is led by the Supreme Court's chief justice,
Aharon Barak. Barak fears the re-tribalization of Israel into a
secular Tel Aviv tribe, an ultra-Orthodox tribe, a Russian tribe, a
high-tech tribe, etc. Many of these tribes have no democratic or
rule-of-law traditions. Barak has been trying to use the high
court's legal rulings to forge a constitutional framework that will
preserve individual rights and keep the centrifugal forces here in
check.
</P>
<P>
   The spiritual response is to reject the narrow, ultra-Orthodox
interpretation of Judaism that dominates Israel today and to try to
develop an alternative that can bridge religious and secular and
embrace modernity. For instance, Yisrael Harel, longtime head of
the Jewish settlers' council in the West Bank, has just teamed with
the Shalom Hartman Institute, which has been developing a tolerant,
pluralistic interpretation of Judaism for Israeli schools. The
settlers have been focused on redeeming the Land of Israel as their
vehicle for Jewish renewal. But with the land now being traded
away, Harel says he is trying to take the energy of the settler
movement and, along with Hartman, broaden its agenda to include
``interpreting Judaism in a more modern, open fashion so that it
can reunite all the Jewish people and preserve Jewish continuity.''
</P>
<P>
   The political response is typified by talk about the Likud's Dan
Meridor, Tel Aviv Mayor Roni Milo and the soon-to-retire army chief
of staff, Amnon Shahak, creating a coalition of the Zionist center.
The aim is to bring together the moderate religious Jews of the
Likud with the moderate secularists of Labor to forge a new
nationalism _ one not dependent, as Likud is now, on the
ultra-Orthodox, who don't want a liberal democracy here, and one
not dependent, as Labor is now, on Israeli Arabs, who don't want a
Jewish democracy here. Stay tuned. (BOX)

<P>
   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
LENS, France _ In the immediate future, we know where U.S. soccer
is going.
</P>
<P>
   Home.
</P>
<P>
   But what about the larger question?
</P>
<P>
   Where will U.S. soccer be four years from now? What about 10
years? What about the much-hyped Project 2010, which is the U.S.
dream plan of winning the World Cup by 2010?
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, everything seems less like a plan and more like a
joke. Much like its 1998 World Cup team, U.S. soccer seems to be
making good time but going nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole World Cup has been a mess,'' U.S. midfielder Tab
Ramos said.
</P>
<P>
   This was supposed to be the year U.S. soccer scored with the
home fans and soared at the World Cup, riding the momentum into the
21st century.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it bounced off the post. And limped home.
</P>
<P>
   Despite bringing to France a nice team of proven veterans,
talented imports, an American-born coach and, most significantly, a
core of young players with apparent world-class skill, the United
States went three-and-out.
</P>
<P>
   The team never seriously threatened in any game, although it
seemed to make good time _ showing flashes of great play but
inevitably falling apart.
</P>
<P>
   It scored but one goal in three games. It played as if it was in
awe of Germany. It lost to Iran, not just a political rival but a
team that was supposedly vastly inferior to the Americans. It made
good time against Yugoslavia but again went nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   And it came apart at the seams, with several players letting fly
with criticisms of coach Steve Sampson, the system, the plan or the
experience in general.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's frustrating is a lot of work has been put into this
team,'' said forward Eric Wynalda, the all-time leading U.S. scorer
who was left off the starting roster for the Iran and Yugoslavia
games. ``For me, this was the most tragic of the three World Cups
I've played in. We can try to rebuild and not let this happen
again.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States has a project ahead of it in the wake of
France '98. Specifically, instead of riding the anticipated good
showing in this tournament, rebuilding the national team seems in
order.
</P>
<P>
   Start with the coach. Sampson's status is shaky at best.
</P>
<P>
   ``I doubt if he'll stay,'' U.S. goalkeeper Kasey Keller said.
</P>
<P>
   Said Ramos: ``He was in way over his head.''
</P>
<P>
   The way Sampson junked his midfield-heavy philosophy immediately
after the opening loss to Germany was a sign of anxiety or lack of
confidence in the system. The change also could have come by order
from above _ specifically U.S. Soccer Federation president Alan
Rothenberg.
</P>
<P>
   Before the tournament, the 3-6-1 system _ six midfielders, three
strikers and a man back _ worked nicely for the Americans, but in
the Germany game it created few chances and was weak defensively.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Sampson's handling of the lineup was confusing and
disjointed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, the team that got us to the World Cup,'' Wynalda
said, ``was not the same as the team that played in the World
Cup.''
</P>
<P>
   Sampson inserted 10 new players as starters over the course of
the three games, which in one respect was what the team needed.
Players such as Claudio Reyna, 24, and Eddie Pope, 24, are skilled
American-born players who could carry this team a long way.
</P>
<P>
   But why 10 first-time starters?
</P>
<P>
   It seemed too much, especially after even Reyna and Pope were
overwhelmed against Germany. The likes of hardened veterans such as
Ramos, Marcelo Balboa, Jeff Agoos and Alexi Lalas stayed on the
bench. And back home, there was the veteran John Harkes, whom
Sampson left off the team after the two clashed over Sampson's
philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   Lalas and Agoos never played in France. For Agoos, it was
especially bitter, considering he was the last player cut from the
1994 World Cup team and lost his starting spot to a Sampson import
_ Martinique-born David Regis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I deserved better than this. That's all I can say,'' Agoos
said.
</P>
<P>
   Balboa played only in the waning minutes of the final game.
Ramos was benched in the first game, then yanked in the second half
of the second game against Iran and sat again in the finale.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy to see it end,'' Ramos said. ``It's been
disappointing the whole way. I don't think we got the best out of
the talent we had.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had spurts. But if you have to blame people, blame the
coaches. Steve Sampson and (assistant) Clive Charles didn't get the
most out of what we had. We could have done a lot better. As long
as Steve Sampson or Clive Charles are around, I don't want to be
any part of it. I hope somebody new comes in.''
</P>
<P>
   Rothenberg has not fired Sampson; he said Sampson's status would
be reviewed in the next 30 days.
</P>
<P>
   Complicating the decision could be Rothenberg's short-term
status as president of the federation. The architect of the 1994
World Cup in the United States, Rothenberg will move on when his
second term as federation president expires in August.
</P>
<P>
   His relationship with Sampson could lead to the duo joining
forces again in Major League Soccer, where Rothenberg has an
interest.
</P>
<P>
   But the players seemed to fire Sampson long before this
tournament was over.
</P>
<P>
   Lalas said if Sampson's tactics were part of a master plan, then
U.S. soccer was in trouble. Sampson admitted he considered sending
Lalas home after hearing those comments after the Iran game.
</P>
<P>
   Ramos tore apart the coach. Wynalda quietly seethed over the
starting snub.
</P>
<P>
   And down the roster the ill feelings went, disintegrating all
World Cup hopes and leaving a bad feeling about where U.S. fortunes
are headed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't play the role we had hoped to play in this
tournament,'' Balboa said. ``We expected to improve on what we
accomplished in 1994 (a second-round appearance). I don't know
what's going to happen now.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with a much stronger financial base than ever, more
exposure through the MLS and numerous national-team programs, U.S.
soccer could be at another crossroads in the wake of this 1998
experience.
</P>
<P>
   After all, the likes of Lalas, Ramos, Agoos, Wynalda and Balboa
likely have played in their last World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Players such as Cobi Jones, Joe-Max Moore and Ernie Stewart _
long considered the bright, young faces of American soccer _ will
be in their 30s at the next World Cup. And Reyna and Pope, the
super-kids, were average.
</P>
<P>
   The opportunity to accomplish something in this World Cup and
raise interest in the game across the country was lost.
</P>
<P>
   Where will the next generation of players come from?
</P>
<P>
   Rothenberg says he feels good about the Under-20 and Under-17
core of players in place, but there are few inner-city soccer
programs such as that of the Houston Parks Department, which
Rothenberg cited by name as an ideal developmental program for the
game.
</P>
<P>
   There also is little street and sandlot soccer in the United
States, unlike other countries where it is common.
</P>
<P>
   ``No doubt, we need to do a better job attracting the best
athletes the United States has to offer into the sport,''
Rothenberg said. ``We need to generate more interest for more
players.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. soccer had a golden opportunity to do that here. But it hit
the post.

Spanish station is down on World Cup rating 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID A. MARKIEWICZ 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
Last week, we suggested that televised soccer is on life support in
this country, World Cup ratings on ABC and ESPN being what they
are.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lousy.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps we should rephrase that. Actually, soccer isn't doing
bad at all on America's leading Spanish-language TV outlet, the
Univision Network.
</P>
<P>
   Univision executives boasted last week that World Cup games
broadcast on their network are attracting one-and-a-half times the
number of viewers tuning in to World Cup games airing at the same
time on ESPN.
</P>
<P>
   They also point out that with ABC and ESPN's biggest drawing
card, the United States, eliminated from the tournament, the ABC
and ESPN ratings are likely to head further south.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, they add, ``the continuing outlook for Univision is
promising, with several Latin and South American teams strong
contenders to advance to Round 2.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprising, you say, given the relative passion for soccer
among Spanish-speaking American soccer fans.
</P>
<P>
   I think it's something else. I think it's Univision's voice of
Futbol, the man who would make us forget Michael Buffer, Andres
Cantor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gooooooooal!'' Girls' fortnight out Tennis' greatest annual
moment, Wimbledon, gets the full TV treatment starting this weekend
when NBC joins HBO in carrying the championships through next
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   It's not exactly going to be a remake of ``Where The Boys Are''.
More like, ``Girls Just Wanna' Have Fun''.
</P>
<P>
   Even with Preen Queen, Anna Kournikova, down with an injury, all
eyes and cameras will be trained on the ladies of the lawn.
</P>
<P>
   As for the guys of the grass, they ought to be relegated to the
secondary courts _ so boring is their game, so lacking are the men
in charismatic stars or intriguing shot making.
</P>
<P>
   Even network commentators agree that the show this year is
Martina Hingis and Venus Williams and Monica Seles.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at the women's draw, and you see matches you really
want to see,'' HBO commentator John Lloyd said. ``In the men's game
right now, that's lacking. Who do we really want to see play? We're
lacking any substantial rivalries.''
</P>
<P>
   HBO executives say this year could be a turning point in the
coverage of tennis, with the women drawing more air time than the
men thanks to the rivalries among top players as well as the
brashness exhibited by stars such as Hingis and Williams.
</P>
<P>
   While their cock-sure attitudes offend some, it sure makes for
great press, and that makes for great match-ups.
</P>
<P>
   ``The women have personalities at the moment,'' says NBC's John
McEnroe, a man who knows something about being a colorful
character.
</P>
<P>
   What men's tennis really needs, he didn't have to add, is
another McEnroe. X marks the spot X Games athletes will tell you
their sports are all about defying gravity. Watching the X Games is
all about defying the commercialism that weighs down the
competition.
</P>
<P>
   There's no getting away from the fact that the X Games are about
commerce first. They were created by ESPN to provide itself
programming and to attract the 12-year-olds to 34-year-olds who
either have lots of cash to burn on advertisers' products or will
some day.
</P>
<P>
   If you can remove yourself a bit from the shallow commercial
rants of the games' sponsors and from the network's
entertainment-first approach, though, you might actually find that
some of the competitors are as athletic in their skills as
Olympians are in their sports.
</P>
<P>
   Unless you regard the X Games as nothing more than the sporting
version of a made-for-TV movie, you will see dedicated athletes.
Who else could perform in-line skating, climbing and barefoot
water-ski jumping at the level seen in San Diego?
</P>
<P>
   You've got a few more days to catch the X Games, which run on
WFAA/Channel 8, ESPN and ESPN2 through Tuesday. (David A.

HIGH-YIELD ALTERNATIVE TO THE MONEY MARKETS

(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 28) 
(af) 
 By TIMOTHY MIDDLETON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   At a time when many money market funds are yielding more than 5
percent, and some more than 5.5 percent, investors could be
forgiven for yawning at a fund that threw off just 5.1 percent. So
what makes the Heartland Short Duration High-Yield Municipal fund a
heart-thumper? It's in the tax-free category, making its yield the
equivalent of 8.4 percent to someone in the top 39.6 percent income
tax bracket.
</P>
<P>
   A money market-like fund with a junk bond-like yield is the idea
behind this offbeat offering, the brainchild of Thomas J. Conlin,
44, and his partner, Greg D. Winston, 33. They moved from Strong
Capital Management to Heartland Advisors Inc. in 1996 and managed
to persuade William J. Nasgovitz, the firm's president, to try
their approach.
</P>
<P>
   Their aim was to take advantage of a potentially profitable
anomaly in bonds: the near absence of a market for junk-rated muni
bonds with very short maturities.
</P>
<P>
   Other mutual funds often buy long-term bonds to reap their
higher yields. For example, the other fund managed by Conlin and
Winston, Heartland High-Yield Municipal Bond, has a yield of 6
percent. But it has to make a trade-off in the so-called effective
duration of its bond portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   Duration is a measure of a bond's economic life; the higher the
number, the more sensitive the bond is to interest-rate swings.
</P>
<P>
   The Short Duration fund has an effective duration of 2.2 years,
versus 7.4 years for High-Yield Municipal Bond. ``In the past,
there hasn't been anyone who's interested in the securities that
we're looking at,'' Winston said. Bank trust departments, for
example, buy only high-quality short-term debt.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves the Heartland portfolio as one of only a few
customers for such bonds. ``This is a good concept,'' said Alice
Lowenstein, fixed-income editor of Morningstar Mutual Funds, the
investment newsletter. She said she knew of no other similar funds
_ at least not yet.
</P>
<P>
   Since it started in January 1997, the Short Duration fund has
delivered an average annual return of 6.6 percent, through May 31,
the same as the Lehman Brothers One- to Three-Year High-Yield
Municipal Index, which tracks these relatively scarce bonds.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, the fund looks like a money market fund. Its net
asset value is relatively steady, having varied only slightly from
the $10 initial offering price; shares are currently worth $10.13.
Check-writing is also offered, in minimum amounts of $250. But
checks amount to a redemption of assets and can thus incur
capital-gains taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We view this clearly as a money-market alternative,'' said
Conlin, the more effusive partner. But Winston, the quieter
partner, interrupted: ``We have to be careful with our phrasing. We
manage for a low degree of share-price variation, but not for a
stable net asset value.''
</P>
<P>
   Winston, who counts exercise and music as his outside interests,
admits to being ``a little more risk-averse'' than Conlin, who is a
recreational pilot.
</P>
<P>
   The counterbalancing of personalities is reflected in the fund's
management style. Both men must agree to buy a bond, but either can
force a sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Greg wakes up and something bothers him about a bond, and
he comes in and says, `I want to sell it,' it's gone,'' Conlin
said. ``We think that's a nice check in our process.''
</P>
<P>
   How do the two reduce credit risk in what, despite its tame
interest-rate exposure, is still a junk-bond fund? They start by
focusing on bonds that underwrite essential community services.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like projects that affect a large number of people, like
water and sewers,'' Winston said. ``We try to avoid projects that
affect a more limited number of people, like a golf course or an
aquarium.'' The latter type is more likely to sour, he said,
especially in a recession.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The partners also like borrowers with relatively little debt and
plenty of cash flow to service it _ and they prefer bonds with
legal covenants that protect bondholders' capital.
</P>
<P>
   The fund often buys short-term portions of issues that also
include longer-term bonds. Relatively little yield is lost: The
spread between long and short rates in the junk muni market is
about 72 hundredths of a percentage point, compared with 95
hundredths in the high-quality universe.
</P>
<P>
   One such issue is the Connecticut Development Authority's 6.875
percent bonds due to mature on Aug. 15, 2004, issued on behalf of a
nursing home in Southington, Conn., that specializes in treating
Alzheimer's disease. The bonds' structure gives them an effective
duration of only three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a first mortgage on the facility and a first lien on
revenues,'' Conlin said. ``We think it's well-managed and, best of
all, it's 100 percent occupied, with a waiting list.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes ``junk'' is a misnomer: More than half the time, the
bonds in the fund are simply unrated by agencies like Moody's and
Standard &AMP; Poor's. Issuers must pay to have their bonds rated, so
small issuers can save by selling unrated paper, even if they have
to pay junk yields.
</P>
<P>
   An example is a 5.4 percent industrial revenue bond of Topeka,
Kan., due April 1, 2005, issued on behalf of Reser's Fine Foods, a
food processor based in Beaverton, Ore. Topeka is home to the
biggest factory operated by the company, which makes potato salad
and other prepared foods.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a family-owned business whose president has been there
since the 1950s,'' Conlin said. ``They cover their niche very well,
and their financial numbers are outstanding _ 1997 revenues are
just shy of five times debt-service coverage.''
</P>
<P>
   The fund also buys longer-term bonds nearing maturity. An
example is the 8.2 percent bonds issued in 1984 by O'Hare
International Airport of Chicago on behalf of United Airlines. The
bonds are rated as junk by S&AMP;P because the airline, not the city,
stands behind the revenues generated from lease payments on landing
gates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our belief is that if United misses a payment, there will be
countless other airlines lining up to take those gates and make
those payments,'' Conlin said.
</P>
<P>
   The bonds are callable on May 1, 1999, at $103 per $100 face
amount. The fund bought them last month for a price that gives an
effective yield to the call date of 4.8 percent. ``If we were to go
buy a money market security we'd get 3.25 percent, and here we're
getting 4.8 percent,'' Conlin said. ``This is perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   The men see themselves as value investors who aim to buy
cheaply, usually because a bond is under a cloud for some reason.
``We buy things when they're down,'' Conlin said. ``Then we're very
patient. We both understand it takes a lot of time for your credit
stories to play out.'' &QL;

VECCHIONE TO HEAD LIFESPAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX PHAM  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lifespan Inc. said Friday it has tapped George A. Vecchione  &UR;  &LR; to
be its next chief executive, effective Sept. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Vecchione, 51, is executive vice president in charge of network
development for the New York and Presbyterian Healthcare System, a
network of 28 hospitals. He will replace William Kreykes, who will
become vice chairman of Lifespan.
</P>
<P>
   Lifespan, based in Providence, R.I., owns five hospitals,
including New England Medical Center in Boston. The company lost
$14 million from operations in its fiscal year ending last October.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Kreykes requested that Lifespan's board develop a
succession plan.
</P>
<P>
   Vecchione helped usher in the January merger between New York
Hospital and Presbyterian Hospital to create New York City's
largest medical center, with about $1.5 billion in yearly revenue
and 12,400 employees. The merger was unusual in that it involved
major teaching hospitals of two prominent medical schools. New York
Hospital, a 1,077-bed facility, is the principal teaching hospital
for Cornell University Medical School, while Presbyterian Hospital,
a 1,093-bed facility, works with Columbia College of Physicians and
Surgeons. &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been some deficits in recent months and years'' at
Lifespan, Vecchione acknowledged in an interview Friday. ``But that
is a condition I'm very used to dealing with. In New York, many
hospitals have financial trouble, especially the academic medical
centers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are fortunate to have a person with such a strong
background in academic medicine,'' said Dr. Thomas O'Donnell, chief
executive of NEMC.
</P>
<P>
   Observers said Vecchione's experience in New York will serve him
well at Lifespan, whose hospitals also have ties to two medical
schools, Tufts University and Brown University schools of medicine.
In addition, New York City, like the Boston area, is home to
numerous world-class medical centers, all fiercely competing with
another.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's an eminent guy from an extraordinarily prestigious
institution,'' said Thomas Reardon, a health care attorney with
Mintz Levin Cohn Ferris Glovsky &AMP; Popeo.
</P>
<P>
   But because Boston has a more aggressive and competitive managed
care insurance market, Vecchione will ``have his work cut out for
him,'' Reardon said.
</P>
<P>
   Vecchione is the second chief executive in recent months to be
plucked from outside the region to lead New England hospitals. Dr.
James L. Reinertsen &UR;  &LR; , head of HealthSystem Minnesota, will next
month become CEO of CareGroup, which owns Beth Israel Deaconess
Medical Center in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a changing of the guards,'' said Ann Thornburg of
Coopers &AMP; Lybrand in Boston. ``New leaders all want to make their
mark, and that means big changes in the equilibrium. Stay tuned.''
</P>
<P>
   Vecchione, a certified public accountant who owns two race
horses, was born in Queens, New York, the son of a postal worker.
He went St. Francis College in Brooklyn and received a masters
degree in health care administration from Rensselaer Polytechnic
Institute in Troy, N.Y.

PARTIES COMMITTED TO NORTH IRELAND PEACE WINNING, BUT BARELY 
</HEADLINE>
  (ps) 
 By WARREN HOGE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland _ Parties committed to the Northern
Ireland peace settlement emerged winners in the election for the
new Assembly on Friday, but candidates opposed to the accord won
enough seats to call into question the value of that victory.
</P>
<P>
   The results showed that the province's two biggest parties, the
Ulster Unionist Party of David Trimble and the Social Democratic
and Labor Party of John Hume, would get the chance to fulfill their
historic pledge to work together to end the sectarian conflict that
has cost more than 3200 lives since 1969.
</P>
<P>
   But the ongoing count of the ballots from Thursday's election,
which will not be completed until Saturday, was exposing deep
divisions in Trimble's support as many party members deserted him
to cast their votes for Protestant candidates wary of the
cooperation with Catholics called for in the peace settlement.
</P>
<P>
   The split in the vote came only among Protestants, as the other
Catholic party besides Hume's, Sinn Fein, the political wing of the
Irish Republican Army, also supports the peace plan and ran
strongly. Its president, Gerry Adams, an easy winner in his West
Belfast district, will become a minister in the Assembly's 12-man
executive.
</P>
<P>
   The mixed results, reflecting fiercely held political and
community convictions, placed in doubt the prospects for a
smooth-running legislature, the centerpiece of the new
constitutional arrangements aimed at bringing stability to this
long-troubled province.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hasn't been as great a success as we would have wanted, but
it is enough to enable us to move forward and progress,'' said
Trimble, who most likely will be the speaker of the Assembly.
``It's just that we have to continue to drag behind us this dead
weight of people who have difficulty moving into the future.''
</P>
<P>
   The accord called for the creation of the Assembly to return
local government to Northern Ireland after 27 years of direct rule
from London, and it structured the body under a strict
power-sharing formula.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement, agreed to on April 10 after 26 months of
negotiations, also laid out other provisions to try to bring
Northern Ireland's long warring Protestant and Catholic communities
together. In referendums May 22 in Ireland and Northern Ireland, it
was endorsed by an overwhelming number of Catholics but only a
slight majority of Protestants.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble in recent weeks had sought to win over reluctant
Protestants, abruptly transforming himself from a tribal politician
defending the diminishing Protestant majority in Northern Ireland
to a leader daring to talk of forming inclusive government and
reaching accommodations with Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   Six of his nine Ulster Unionist colleagues in the British
Parliament, however, failed to back him, and the Protestant
politicians who voted no in the referendum, led by the gruff
preacher Ian Paisley, vowed to elect enough people to the
108-member Assembly to frustrate its efforts to share authority
with Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   The election was conducted under a complicated ``single
transferable vote'' procedure which is designed to guarantee
proportional representation. Voters filled in the names of up to 20
candidates in the order of their preference. Friday's count first
tabulated all the first preferences and then moved on to figuring
out who the closest finishers were and how many surplus votes from
the winners could be ``transferred'' to them to gain them election.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the complexity of the ballot, the tabulation was
going slowly with only one third of the voter choices counted by 11
p.m. when the tabulation stopped for the night. A BBC forecast
showed the Ulster Unionists with 30 seats, the Social Democratic
and Labor Party with 24, the Democratic Unionists with 20, Sinn
Fein with 17, and the other 17 going to smaller parties. The
network said the anti-agreement forces accounted for 29 seats, one
shy of the number felt necessary to give them the power to obstruct
the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to nail the hide of Trimble and the hide of
Blair, two liars, to the fence,'' Paisley said with jubilation as
he followed the count from his North Antrim district. British Prime
Minister Tony Blair was a sponsor of the peace talks that led to
the settlement and had tried to shore up Trimble when he came under
attack from dissident Unionists.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As he followed the results in his Upper Bann district, Trimble
said: ``I hoped we were making progress since the referendum, but
it might even be we are slipping back a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Adams expressed concern at the dents in Trimble's
leadership. ``The Unionist vote has shredded, and that's
regrettable,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the Assembly's early obligations is to create a
cross-border council that will bring together members of the
government of Ireland and the new government of Northern Ireland.
Paisley and his followers have vowed to stymie that, saying today
that they intended to ``destroy the pan-Nationalist front.''
</P>
<P>
   Nationalist is the term for people, largely Catholic, who seek
eventual absorption into Ireland, the nation to the south.
Unionists are those, mostly Protestant, who favor remaining within
the United Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   Gregory Campbell, a member of Paisley's Democratic Unionist
Party, who won a seat from Londonderry, said: ``Anything in the
Assembly that is likely to lead us closer to the Republic of
Ireland, we will block, will vote against and we will endeavor to
stop.''
</P>
<P>
   The new speaker, known as the ``first minister'', and his deputy
will be chosen next week at a preliminary meeting of he Assembly.
The likely pair are Trimble, though in a far weaker state than he
had hoped, and Hume.
</P>
<P>
   What appeared to have cost Trimble support were disputes in
recent weeks over when disarmament of paramilitary groups like the
Irish Republican Army would begin and whether paramilitary
prisoners would continue to gain early release in the absence of
any guns being turned in. His critics said that without firmer
conditions governing those two matters than existed in the final
settlement document, members of parties like Sinn Fein that are
linked to paramilitary groups could take office in the new Northern
Ireland government without making any permanent commitment to
ending violence.
</P>
<P>
   Sinn Fein has pledged itself to the principle of nonviolence,
and the IRA has maintained a cease fire for nearly a year. But in a
place where mistrust is so deep and the memory of bloodshed is so
fresh, these steps and Trimble's calm reassurances and lunge for
the statesmanlike stance have not dissuaded opponents from their
blocking tactics.
</P>
<P>
   Decisions in the assembly will require majority support from
both the Protestant and Catholic blocs in an arrangement designed
to forestall sectarian exploitation. But it also makes the body
susceptible to obstruction by Protestant politicians opposed to
carrying out the peace accord.
</P>
<P>
   Hume's party succeeded in turning back a bid from Sinn Fein to
cut into its position as the largest Catholic party. In recent
elections, Sinn Fein had been capturing more and more of the
Catholic vote, but it was Hume and his party that made gains this
time at the expense of Sinn Fein.

US COACH RESPONDS TO CRITICISM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NANTES, France _ US soccer coach Steve Sampson, who had said
repeatedly that he would not criticize his players publicly, lashed
back at three-time World Cup veteran Tab Ramos Friday as the
winless team left for home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here is an individual I essentially held a spot open for eight
or nine months,'' Sampson said about Ramos, who had vowed he'd
never play for the coach again after being benched for Thursday
night's finale against Yugoslavia. ``I played Tab in the most
critical match against Iran. Tab was responsible for the first goal
against us. It's unfair he feels free to voice his opinion about me
when I gave him so much respect.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramos, who had played in every Cup match in 1990 and 1994, was
questionable for this year's roster after tearing up the same knee
twice in less than a year. But Sampson, citing Ramos's value to the
team over the years, had promised he would hold a spot open for him
as long as he could. Ramos ended up coming off the bench for the
final 20 minutes against Germany after the US was already behind,
2-0, and being replaced after 57 minutes against Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Also outspoken Friday were defenders Alexi Lalas and Jeff Agoos,
who were the only field players not to get playing time. Lalas, one
of the team's most recognizable players with his flowing red hair
and goatee, had played every minute in 1994 and competed in 12 of
the 16 qualifying matches. Agoos, who burned his training gear when
he was cut from the 1994 team, had played more minutes than anybody
else during qualifying. But two blatant errors _ a giveaway that
provided Jamaica with a 1-1 tie in a critical home match and a red
card that forced the US to play a man down for the final 58 minutes
at Mexico _ caused Agoos's stock to plummet.
</P>
<P>
   Once Sampson went to a 3-6-1 formation with only three defenders
and brought in newly naturalized citizen David Regis just two weeks
before the team left for France, Lalas and Agoos were virtually
doomed to the bench. So was defender Marcelo Balboa, who had more
caps (127) than any other US player in history but played only a
token eight minutes at the end of the Yugoslavia match.
</P>
<P>
   ``You earn the right to represent your country every time you
step on the field,'' said Sampson. ``No one should feel they have
the right to represent their country. That right is earned every
single day.''
</P>
<P>
   Though US Soccer Federation president Alan Rothenberg had denied
reports that the players had been threatened with retribution if
they made their unhappiness public, Sampson said the dissidents
would be fined for ``bringing the federation into disrepute'' with
their comments.

<P>
   VILLA ROSARIO, Bolivia _ Coca growers ambushed a drug
eradication team near this rebellious hamlet one day early this
month, leaving one policeman dead and three wounded. The next day
600 soldiers and policemen barreled through the jungle in a show of
force.
</P>
<P>
   With two armed helicopters hovering overhead, the security
forces slashed 10 acres of coca bushes with machetes. The hamlet
was virtually empty but the police arrested a single straggler who
they said was carrying a dynamite fuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've returned to show the cocaleros we will not be stopped,''
army Lt. Col. Jorge Antello, 44, the commander of the operation,
told a reporter, as soldiers trained their rifles at the
surrounding foliage.
</P>
<P>
   Such expressions of determination in the battle against cocaine
represent a break from the past _ even though many of the soldiers
did take dried coca leaves from town to chew, then or later.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the official determination to do away with coca is a
change. Only six years ago, a Bolivian president wore a pin shaped
like a coca leaf on his lapel, symbolizing years of half-hearted
efforts against drugs that drove U.S. ials to distraction. Last
year, Washington came close to decertifying Bolivia as a country
committed to fighting drugs and close to cutting off tens of
millions of dollars in aid, but at the last moment, La Paz
fulfilled a U.S.-set eradication quota.
</P>
<P>
   Then suddenly in January, the new Bolivian president, the
retired general Hugo Banzer Suarez, pledged to wipe out every
illegal coca plant by the end of his term, in 2002. In Bolivia,
illegal plants are defined as those planted since 1988, in areas
where international traffickers operate. After six months, his
stepped-up efforts have won praise from the Clinton administration
and U.N. officials.
</P>
<P>
   But the efforts have set off increasing violence by coca
growers, including blockades of crucial roads and ambushes against
the security forces here in Chapare, a region the size of New
Jersey where one-quarter of the total world cocaine supply
originates.
</P>
<P>
   Under Banzer's program, 90,000 acres of coca fields will be
destroyed in the next four years at a cost of $108 million, with
another $700 million going to providing basic improvements like
roads and granting credits and training of farmers to grow
alternative crops. Government officials said they expect that much
of the funding will come from the United States, along with sizable
contributions from the European Community and the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   In a reversal of past government policy, Banzer has pledged to
phase out payments to coca growers for voluntarily eradicating
their illegal crops. During the last several years, coca farmers
have been paid $2,500 for every 2.5 acres they eradicate, in a
program that has cost American taxpayers nearly $100 million over
the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   But U.S. and Bolivian officials said many of the farmers took
the money and then cultivated just as much coca acreage deeper in
the jungle. Bolivia had 113,200 acres of coca under cultivation in
1997, according to the CIA, just 3 percent less than it had in
1993. State Department officials, tired of subsidizing coca
growers, pushed hard for the policy change.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new strategy, farmers will be paid nothing and smaller
payments will go to the communities for resettlement and social
programs until there is a complete cutoff in 2002. Government
officials said the savings will go into law enforcement and
economic development, but they concede that the policy is unpopular
among coca farmers.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the year 2002, cocaine will be worthless in Bolivia,'' the
Interior minister, Guido Nayar Parada, asserted in an interview.
``The armed resistance by the cocaleros only shows that we are
having an impact and we will not be deterred from applying the
law.''
</P>
<P>
   While U.S. officials here love to hear such unqualified
commitment, they caution that it will take much to overcome years
of disappointments. A State Department official said that despite
improvements in eradication, only 1 percent of the cocaine base now
being produced in Chapare is being intercepted. The figure is so
low, he said, because police patrol traffickers' routes during the
day but not at night, and because corrupt police are allowing
illegal cargoes through road blocks.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials note that although cultivating new coca fields
has been illegal since 1988, only a handful of the 40,000 coca
growers in the country have been arrested.
</P>
<P>
   And while U.S. officials compliment the government for pressing
projects to replace coca crops with legal crops like pineapples and
bananas, they warn that it will be difficult to wean peasants off a
coca crop that is resistant to tropical funguses and floods, offers
a predictable market, and can be harvested four times a year with
little effort.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile the Americans say that ambushes of police _ there have
been nine since April 2, killing three policemen and wounding 15
more _ have slowed eradication efforts. The Bolivian government is
now forced to mobilize far larger forces in eradication sweeps,
which are slower and more costly. Leaders of six coca grower unions
say 12 growers have been killed during confrontations with the
security forces in recent months, while the government admits to
only two.
</P>
<P>
   But U.S. officials also see reasons for optimism. They note that
a growing number of peasant groups are signing agreements with the
government to eradicate their coca crops. And a Bolivian
anti-terrorism unit, trained and financed by the CIA, began
operating in th Chapare recently and is making an impact.
</P>
<P>
   The unit has captured a list of terrorist leaders and a code
book for terrorist operations belonging to one of the six coca
unions that are planting illegal crops in a local national park,
according to Bolivian army and State Department officials.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Banzer's ambitious plan comes at a time when Bolivia's role in
the drug world is going through a rapid transformation. Only three
years ago, traffickers from Colombia's Cali Cartel bought coca base
and paste from Bolivian middlemen, moved it to Colombia for
processing, and the drugs then moved through Mexico and the
Caribbean to the U.S. market.
</P>
<P>
   But with the arrests of the top Cali leaders and Peru's decision
to shoot down cocaine flights, smaller Colombian organizations that
have replaced the cartel have stepped up coca cultivation at home.
That has made Bolivian coca far less important to international
traffickers. The trend should help Banzer's efforts, even if it is
unlikely to make a dent in the drug trade on the streets of
American cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can't achieve our objectives in Bolivia with the help we
are getting from this government,'' a senior U.S. Embassy official
said, ``we can't succeed anywhere in South America.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the wealth that coca sales bring is evident everywhere in
the Chapare, making peasants all the more resistant to change.
Imported Chilean wines and bottles of Johnnie Walker scotch are
available in neighborhood stores that only stocked cheap beer a
decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The challenge is to convert growers accustomed to getting out
of their hammocks four times a year to pick coca off trees,'' a
U.S. official said, ``into real farmers able to do backbreaking
work and fight off the funguses and pests that plague tropical
crops. That won't be easy.''

WOMEN CONTINUE TO OUTPACE MEN IN EARNING COLLEGE DIPLOMAS, CENSUS
BUREAU SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release 12:01 a.m. Monday, June 29)   (For use by New York Times News Service Clients.)  
 By NICOLE TSONG  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The number of women with college degrees continued
to outpace men last year, while young blacks have erased their
historic gap with whites in earning high school diplomas, a new
Census Bureau study says.
</P>
<P>
   In a report to be released Monday, the bureau also said the
number of Hispanic students with high school diplomas grew,
although the graduation rate lags considerably behind other ethnic
groups.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, 29 percent of women ages 25 to 29 had earned at least
one college degree, whereas 26 percent of young men had completed a
college education, the annual report said.
</P>
<P>
   By 1990, 24 percent of men and women 25 to 29 had at least one
college degree, but women began gaining a year later and that trend
continues, the Census Bureau reported.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suspect women will continue to be a majority because men, as
well as women, are convinced that a middle-class family needs two
wage earners. They both want to see her bring home a good secure
paycheck ... there is continual pressure to get as much education
as they can,'' said Geraldine Clifford, a retired professor of
education at the University of California at Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   Men dominated the ranks of students receiving diplomas for many
years, but significant changes in college attendance for women have
been recorded for 30 or more years.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Day, author of the Census report, said women's
achievement in education is a ``straight line going up ... in terms
of this particular issue, they are on par and succeeding.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1967, 12.7 percent of women 25 to 29 had attended and
completed college, whereas 18.3 percent of men in the same age
group had earned at least one degree.
</P>
<P>
   In the next decade, college graduation rates for each sex had
grown at the same pace _ 10 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   But the percentage of men receiving college diplomas fell in the
1980s. And by 1990, the sexes were even.
</P>
<P>
   Clifford attributed much of the increase for women over the
years to changing attitudes about their role in the workplace. In
addition, anti-discrimination legislation such as Title IX gave
women more opportunities in education.
</P>
<P>
   In the overall population, men still hold the majority of the
college diplomas, but Clifford said that would change as more and
more women graduate.
</P>
<P>
   The education gap between black and Caucasian high school
graduates no longer exists, based a survey of those 25 to 29. Among
both races, an average of 87 percent had completed high school, the
1997 report said.
</P>
<P>
   The high school graduation rate among young African Americans
grew about 3 percentage points in the previous decade while the
rate for whites grew 1.3 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   The number of Hispanics who had received a high school diploma
grew from 51 percent to 55 percent between 1987 and 1997. In the
same period, the number of Hispanics who had earned a college
diploma increased from 22 percent to 29 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The rate of high school completion for Hispanics is considerably
less than the nationwide average of 82 percent, but Day said the
discrepancy was due in large part to the foreign-born Hispanic
population.
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, 43 percent of foreign-born Hispanics
hold a high school diploma, while 70 percent of native-born Latinos
have finished their secondary schooling.
</P>
<P>
   Among Asian Americans, 84.9 percent had earned high school
diplomas, according to the 1997 figures, while 50 percent of those
25 to 29 had earned a college degree.
</P>
<P>
   Education levels varied from region to region as well, with
Alaska and Wyoming maintaining the highest levels of high school
completion _ more than 90 percent of the young people in those
states had earned a diploma.
</P>
<P>
   The District of Columbia, Maryland and Massachusetts surpassed
the national college completion average of 23 percent, with an
average of 33 percent of young adults in those areas holding
college diplomas.

NEW ENGLAND STOCK FALLS IN NHL ENTRY DRAFT 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. _ Business used to be good, booming. When it came
to sending top talent to the National Hockey League's entry draft,
New England once was a cottage industry.
</P>
<P>
   It was hottest of all in the early 1980s. In a span of 24
months, Bob Carpenter of Peabody, Mass., dubbed The Can't-Miss Kid,
was selected third overall by the Washington Capitals in 1981, and
the Minnesota North Stars in '83 made Brian Lawton of Woonsocket,
R.I., the first American ever to be selected No. 1. New England was
first in seafood and a close second on frozen ponds.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's happened down there?'' Jim Gregory, the National Hockey
League's vice president of hockey operations, recently mused. ``It
seems we used to go down there and just drool over the talent. It
doesn't seem quite the same anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Opinions vary regarding our good New England stock gone bad.
There are those who contend that the six-state region is doing just
fine, thanks, as shown by the likes of Bryan Berard of Woonsocket
going first overall in 1995 and Paul Mara of Belmont (Mass.) Hill
being taken seventh by the Tampa Bay Lightning last year, one slot
ahead of the Bruins' Sergei Samsonov, who Thursday night was
crowned the 1997-98 rookie of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there are still plenty of good players in New
England,'' said Mara's agent, Jay Fee. ``I'd be more concerned if I
didn't see these kids making it to the NHL. But draft position
aside, I'd say look at the overall success some of them have had
... the job (Boston University's) Mike Grier's done in Edmonton,
and I think Joe Hulbig (of Wrentham, Mass.) will make an impact for
them, too. I think the talent's still there. Kids like (Chris)
Drury, (Tom) Poti, and (Chris) Kelleher (all from BU) are going to
make an impact in the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   For those keeping track in the six-state region, here are the
draft positions of the aforementioned native sons: Grier (219/'93),
Hulbig (13/'92), Drury (72/'94), Poti (59/'96), and Kelleher
(130/'93).
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't given it a lot of thought,'' said another
Boston-based agent, Bob Murray, whose client list includes Medford,
Mass., superstar scorer Keith Tkachuk. ``These things tend to go in
cycles, fits and spurts, and why that is, I can't tell you.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
A lean crop
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The NHL holds its annual teenage lovefest Saturday here at
Marine Midland Arena, and New Englanders won't play a very
prominent part in the picture. The highest-rated local is Bobby
Allen, the 6-foot-1-inch defenseman from Hull, Mass., who helped
Boston College reach the NCAA final this year. The NHL's Central
Scouting staff ranks Allen No. 34 among all North American
defensemen and forwards. Factoring in Europeans and all goalies,
home and abroad, Allen still could be there for the taking when the
Bruins make their first pick at No. 46. He also could shift higher
or lower, depending on everything from individual teams' needs to
barometric pressure over Lake Erie. In other words, it isn't
exactly a science, folks.
</P>
<P>
   For the fifth time in the last seven years, New England won't
place someone from Our Town among the top 10 NHL prospects. It's a
stark and striking contrast to 1986, for instance, when Connecticut
had two of its own _ Brian Leetch and Craig Janney _ hear their
names called within the first 13 picks. Another example: the same
year Lawton was selected No. 1, Tom Barrasso of Acton-Boxboro
(Mass.) went No. 5 to the Buffalo Sabres.
</P>
<P>
   Those who do acknowledge the downturn in homegrown talent aren't
sure of its root cause. Some agree with Murray, that it is simply
cyclical, and believe New England again shall rise from beneath the
rink. Others suggest that while Canadian junior players have
maintained their solid foothold in the draft, Americans have been
muscled and finessed off the puck by their teenage counterparts
from Russia, Sweden, Finland, and the Czech Republic.
</P>
<P>
   In New England, we've found out that the Can't-Miss Kid of '98
most likely doesn't live next door. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Excess baggage?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The reason? One large school of thought is that too much hockey
is not a good thing and too many American teenagers are putting in
excessive, unproductive time on skates. By no means has the
six-state region seen a downturn in the numbers of young men
playing hockey, but some experts believe some of the best players,
those who are often projected as potential stars by their early or
mid-teens, place themselves on an unending treadmill of game after
game, playing hockey 12 months a year without a break, not
necessarily seeing their skills improve and sometimes losing their
passion for the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``The season's so long, it takes the sparkle out of the sport
for some of these kids,'' said Ben Smith, the longtime college
coach from Gloucester, Mass., who directed the US women's squad to
the Olympic gold medal in Nagano and was an assistant coach with
the US men's Olympic squad in '88. ``You find these young men who
want to get the exposure, be noticed by scouts, and they're out
there in June or July playing in a three-game tournament for all
the marbles. One week later, they're in another tournament for all
the marbles. Well, gee, how many marbles are there?

EXPANSION DRAFT SENDS DEVIL GOALIE MIKE DUNHAM TO NASHVILLE
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By JOE LAPOINTE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. _ Goalie Mike Dunham used to be a Devil, and now
he is a Nashville Predator. People can conjure in their minds the
image of a devil. But what figure represents a Predator?
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not know,'' Dunham said with a smile after being chosen
as one of Nashville's first 26 players in Friday's expansion draft.
Judging by the front of the jersey he wore, Dunham said: ``It's an
animal with a big tooth.'' But, he added: ``If I had to explain it
to school kids, I couldn't do it.''
</P>
<P>
   A team official said the beast, which is gold, blue, silver and
orange, is a saber-toothed tiger. Dunham, the only selection to
appear here and wear the jersey, is one of the players likely to
stay in Nashville. He said he is happy about the prospect of
playing more games after serving as backup to Martin Brodeur for
the last two seasons and making only 41 National Hockey League
appearances. Although General Manager David Poile announced 25
other names, he also said he expects to make trades soon.
</P>
<P>
   One of the reasons for the shuffle is that Poile chose six free
agents from other teams, including Mike Richter of the Rangers, who
can become an unrestricted free agent on July 1. Should Richter or
the other free agents sign with other teams, the Predators would
have the rights to any compensation.
</P>
<P>
   In Richter's case, it would be not directly from the team
signing him but as an at-large pick added to next summer's entry
draft, probably in the second round. Neil Smith, president and
general manager of the Rangers, said Friday he would ask Poile and
the league if it is legal for Smith to negotiate with Richter
before July 1, in that it is unlikely that Poile will offer Richter
the multi-year contract he wants ($5 to $7 million per year with a
no-trade clause).
</P>
<P>
   Last season, in similar circumstances, Smith's Rangers lost Mark
Messier through unrestricted free agency to the Vancouver Canucks.
</P>
<P>
   Next summer, unless he signs before then, the Rangers could lose
defenseman Brian Leetch through the same process. Jay Grossman,
agent for Leetch, said this week that he has talked casually about
Leetch with Smith but that no formal negotiations have begun. Under
the collective bargaining agreement, veterans over 31 have strong
free-agency leverage that increases during their final contract
seasons, a dynamic that still seems to escape some team executives.
</P>
<P>
   The Islanders lost defenseman J.J. Daigneault to the Predators.
Mike Milbury, general manager of the Islanders, said: ``We knew we
would lose a good player, but it's tough to lose J.J. He filled an
important role. We're looking at ways to fill that role.''
Daigneault joined the Islanders on Feb. 6 in a trade with Anaheim.
Milbury also is seeking to hire an associate coach to run the bench
while he maintains the official title of head coach.
</P>
<P>
   Milbury said earlier this week that Ted Nolan, former coach of
the Sabres, had taken his name out of consideration. However, Nolan
appeared on the scene Friday seeking a meeting with Milbury. An
Islanders spokesman, Chris Botta, said the two would probably meet.
</P>
<P>
   The other unrestricted free agents chosen by the Predators are
Uwe Krupp of Colorado and Rob Zettler of Toronto. The restricted
free agents are Patrick Cote of Dallas, Chris Armstrong of Florida
and Andrew Brunette of Washington. Of the players under contract,
the best-known names are Doug Brown of Detroit, Tony Hrkac of
Pittsburgh, Mikhal Shtalenkov of Anaheim and Al Iafrate of San
Jose. Because the Devils and Rangers both technically lost goalies
Friday, neither can lose a goalie next year, when another draft is
held to stock the Atlanta team.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's draft is the preliminary to Saturday's entry draft of
18-year-olds. The Rangers will choose seventh on the first round,
the Islanders ninth and the Devils 26th. &QL;

 BUFFALO, N.Y.: ... are there?

   ``Some of them just aren't getting a break, and it doesn't seem
like they're getting any better, either. Maybe they just don't need
to be playing 13 months a year. They get locked in that syndrome,
you know: `I got to make the doughnuts.' After a while, the fun's
out of it. And when you lose your passion for something, you lose
everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Look at Leetch, said Smith, and you see a hockey athlete who
``just loves to play the game.'' Ditto Carpenter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know Bobby Carpenter well,'' said Smith. ``But he must
love the game. Everything he's been through, including some pretty
serious injuries (including a shattered kneecap in his Bruins
days), and being a superstar in the NHL for a while, to going out
there and just playing his rear end off year after year. Now some
people will say he's like that just for the money, but I'd say,
(`Ridiculous'). Hey, no one ever got a better lesson in that that I
just did, from 20 girls. They went out and played hockey for one
reason _ passion for the game _ in a time when a lot of them were
told, `Hey, forget hockey, that's a boys' game. Get off the rink.'
They played because they loved it, pure and simple, and I can tell
you there are a lot of guys playing who don't share that same
passion.''
</P>
<P>
   Two Massachusetts men, Dan Esdale and Bob Richardson, are strong
advocates of getting top teenage hockey players out of skates for a
number of weeks each year in hopes that they'll perform better when
the puck is dropped.
</P>
<P>
   Esdale, a regional director for USA Hockey, feels New England
teenagers were better-rounded athletes in the '60s and '70s, even
into the '80s. They played a wider array of sports. A hockey
athlete might also have played football in the fall and baseball in
the spring. It still happens, but not as much. The serious hockey
player gets mainstreamed almost upon puberty, sets his eyes on the
net, and doesn't look elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``When our kids got into hockey 12 months a year,'' said Esdale,
``we gave up. We lost our athletes. We said just one thing too
often: `Play.' We did the games, which is what Canada did, too, but
we stopped taking breaks _ and you need those breaks for physical
and mental reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson, a longtime hockey booster in the inner city and a
part-time scout for the Dallas Stars, is disheartened when he sees
local kids playing ``12 months times 12 months times 12 months. And
if it did (help), I'd be encouraging them to do it, because I'm in
the hockey business. But it doesn't work for the kids and it
doesn't work for the parents, who get caught up in believing
they've got to get their kid in some Canadian tournament, at a cost
of, say, $3,000, just so they're `seen.' They get bled dry, and for
what? So their kid can squeeze in 12 minutes of hockey? Forget
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Esdale and Richardson have helped form and shape the
Massachusetts Satellite Training Program, encouraging top hockey
athletes to emphasize off-ice training in the summer, augmented
with limited playing time. Both men feel that European players long
ago subscribed to off-ice training, getting away from the game, and
have seen their skills develop faster and better than their
American counterparts. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Alternative avenues
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Local young men who have developed into top draft prospects in
recent years also have jiggled to the top of Central Scouting's
list via significant change in routes. In the days of Carpenter and
Lawton, high school hockey did the trick. Carpenter went to St.
John's Prep in Danvers, Mass., and Lawton to Mount St. Charles in
Woonscocket. They weren't getting the megadose of games that the
Canadian Junior A kids were getting, but they were winning the ink
and praise of the media, as well as capturing the admiring eye of
Central Scouting.
</P>
<P>
   In recent drafts, however, the New England kids deemed best and
brightest by Central Scouting have tuned up in Junior A for at
least one year leading up to the draft.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall of '94, at age 17, Berard left high school hockey
and played two seasons for Detroit in the Ontario Hockey League.
Some nine months after leaving home, he was chosen No. 1 overall by
the Senators, who later swapped him to the Islanders. The only
other New Englander to go in the first round in '95, goaltender
Brian Boucher, also from Woonsocket, spent the 1994-95 season
playing for Tri-City in the Western Hockey League. After one season
there, he was chosen 22d overall by the Flyers.
</P>
<P>
   Mara, the other blue-chip prospect from New England, bid adieu
to Belmont Hill on the eve of his 17th birthday in '96 and played
for Sudbury in the Ontario Hockey League. The following spring, he
was the Lightning's top pick, and he could be ticketed for the
Tampa Bay defense within three months.
</P>
<P>
   For now, if you're from New England, Junior A appears to be the
way. USA Hockey also has structured an elite program in Ann Arbor,
Mich., which this fall for a second time will bring in many of the
country's best teenagers for a full season of training and playing
under national coach Jeff Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Ron DeGregorio of Salem, N.H., among those who spearheaded the
formation of the national program, said it was formed partially in
response to the Canadian junior system.
</P>
<P>
   ``It allows some of our kids to seek their dream here,'' said
DeGregorio. ``Over time, it may be a percursor to (Canadian) Tier 1
or Tier 2 hockey, with each player keeping his eligibility intact.
Education is still very important, a very important element. I
think some (American) kids have felt a need that they have to catch
up with the Canadians, and now other countries, and they think
because of that, they have to play all year. But there are some
good US players _ Kevin Stevens (Pembroke, Mass.) and John LeClair
(St. Albans, Vt.) _ who dispel that myth. In both cases, they took
up the game late and they played other sports, too, and they made
it work. Hockey doesn't have to be everything you do.''

RED SOX AWAIT FEASIBLITY STUDY FOR NEW FENWAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Red Sox have a plan for a new stadium. But it is not The
Plan for a new stadium, and whether it becomes a reality has not
been determined.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox are awaiting a final report from Arthur Andersen, the
nationally prominent consulting company, on the economic
feasibility of a new Fenway Park. In other words, if the Andersen
report says the Sox can use their own money to build it and still
make a profit, that's what the team will do.
</P>
<P>
   Right now the Sox are looking at the parcel of land that runs
along Boylston Street from Yawkey Way, where the present park is
located, west toward the Fenway. Andersen has been chosen to decide
if fans in this area will support a new stadium with a capacity of
45,000 by purchasing expensive luxury boxes, preferred seating, and
more expensive seats overall.
</P>
<P>
   The plan the Sox are hoping for has several stages. They would
build a new park while playing in the present park. When the new
park is finished, they would tear down the old one and develop that
land to generate money to fund the new facility.
</P>
<P>
   It will probably be closer to the end of the season before the
Red Sox have a press conference to detail the plan and what help
they hope to get from the city of Boston.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   Look for Dave Meggett to file a lawsuit against the Patriots and
their doctors. Meggett will claim that his injury _ a broken bone
in his foot suffered in the final playoff game at Pittsburgh _ was
misdiagnosed, which is why he was walking around on it for several
months before the problem was discovered. Meggett will also file an
injury grievance against the team for releasing him when he was
injured. Under NFL rules, the most he can get for the injury
grievance is $200,000.
</P>
<P>
   Reportedly, the reason authorities in Toronto dropped sexual
assault charges against Meggett was that there were no bruises or
marks on the alleged victim, according to the physicians who
examined her.
</P>
<P>
   If the Toronto police go forward with a robbery charge against
him, Meggett's defense will be that the woman tried to rob him and
that he caught her trying to go out the door of her hotel room with
his wallet and watch, which he then recovered.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   This is the kind of guy Payne Stewart is. The day after his
heartbreaking final-round loss to Lee Janzen in the US Open, he
showed up for a charity tournament staged by his friend D.A.
Weibring. Stewart had every reason to beg off but didn't.
</P>
<P>
   He told a close friend that his only regret when he lost a
four-shot lead in the final round of the Open Sunday was that he
did not ask for a ground-under-repair ruling on the 12th hole.
Stewart hit his drive into the fairway, but it rolled into a divot
filled with sand and stopped. He played the shot from there,
hitting it into a bunker, and failed to get up and down for par.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart reportedly feels now that since the divot had been
repaired by putting sand in it, the ruling could have been that it
was ground under repair, and in that case, he would have been
allowed to take a free drop. Stewart says he would have rather hit
the ball out of the divot with no sand in it than out of sand of
uncertain depth.

   Mark McGwire is not doing Mo Vaughn any favors. McGwire is
playing for $9.5 million annually on a new three-year contract.
Vaughn initially told the Sox last fall that he would accept a
contract in the McGwire range. That was before McGwire signed.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox offered Vaughn $10 million annually for three years, and
he turned it down when they signed Pedro Martinez for more.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn is a first baseman. McGwire is a first baseman. Frank
Thomas of the White Sox, who has had a better career than Mo, is
making $10 million annually on a six-year contract, and he's a
first baseman.
</P>
<P>
   All the so-called big-market teams have first basemen who are
good and making big money.

   A few weeks back, Nancy Bachard of Haydenville, Mass. was riding
by the local golf course when she heard a thump. She didn't pay
attention to the noise until she got home and found damage to her
car.
</P>
<P>
   Bachard returned to the course and found the owner talking with
golfer Todd Obuchowski of Northampton, who said he hit a shot on a
par 3 onto Route 9, only to have it bounce back onto the green and
into the cup for a hole-in-one. Bachard verified that her car had
been hit.
</P>
<P>
   Obuchowski achieved some fame when his story was sent around the
country by the Associated Press, but as of last week, Bachard was
still waiting to collect the $231 to repair the damage to her car.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Here are some reasons that Bill Parcells opted to sign the
well-traveled Vinny Testaverde to a Jets contract this week.
</P>
<P>
   When Parcells made the playoffs in his second year with the
Patriots, Testaverde completed 20 of 30 passes for 268 yards, with
a touchdown and no first downs, and three times ran for first
downs, including a 36-yard gain, as he led the Cleveland Browns
past New England, 20-13, in a 1994 wild-card game. In '96, when he
was playing for Baltimore, Testaverde threw for 353 yards and three
touchdowns, completing 29 of 45 passes, though the Patriots hung on
to beat the Ravens, 46-38. This was the game that cost Jimmy
Hitchcock his starting cornerback's job for the rest of the
Parcells regime. Then last year in Giants Stadium, Testaverde threw
a touchdown pass in the closing moments to tie the game against
Parcells's Jets and send it into overtime, where New York won on a
field goal.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever someone mentioned Testaverde's name around Parcells,
his response would almost always be, ``The kid scares me to
death.''
</P>
<P>
   Parcells told Testaverde that Glenn Foley will be his starting
quarterback, but if he falters or Testaverde outplays him in the
exhibition season, Vinny will be No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells never liked Neil O'Donnell and saved $2.5 million under
the salary cap by getting rid of him.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
---- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The buzz this week was that Michael Jordan soon will announce
his retirement from basketball. However, someone who knows him well
says that even if Jordan were going to retire, he would not do so
now.
</P>
<P>
   The odds weigh heavily in favor of a lockout in the NBA starting
Wednesday, and smart people think it will run a month into the
season.
</P>
<P>
   If Jordan quits before July 1, the Bulls would be able to use
his salary to sign a bunch of new players. Jordan won't let that
happen. His public promise not to return to Chicago if Phil Jackson
did not return as coach has been rescinded.
</P>
<P>
   Reportedly, Jordan told owner Jerry Reinsdorf that if Jackson
left on his own (which he did), then Jordan would come back if
Scottie Pippen came back.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls reportdly are ready to offer Pippen $40 million over
two years. However, Phoenix may come after him with $60 million for
four years. Does Pippen take the $40 mil and hope his body holds
out or take the $60 mil, which he would get no matter what? The
guessing is that he will take the $60 mil.

   Larry Kennan, who was demoted as Patriots offensive coordinator
and later quit as an offensive assistant, obviously is well
regarded by his colleagues around the NFL. Kennan has been named
the first president of the NFL Coaches Association, which means he
will oversee some delicate negotations with the league office in
the coming months. The NFL assistants get dumped on by the league,
and have been for years. The word is that if they don't get a
better deal in terms of benefits and pension on paper within a
year, they will officially become a unit and hook up with the
Players Association, which the owners do not want to happen ... Who
ever thought we would see the day when not a single American tennis
player is ranked in the top 12 money winners in the world going
into Wimbledon? Andre Agassi, the top US earner, was 13th ... Why
doesn't anyone ever mention Brian Jordan of the St. Louis
Cardinals, one of the best dual athletes ever? Jordan was a
terrific safety when he played for the Atlanta Falcons, making the
Pro Bowl one year as a special teams player. Now he leads the
National League in hitting. Bo Jackson and Deion Sanders never came
close to hitting the ball as consistently as Jordan has this year
... The most unappreciated couple ever to grace Boston were the
Yawkeys. To this point, the two charitable foundations left by Tom
and Jean have produced $27 million, with most of that going to the
needy in the Greater Boston area ... Harvard's baseball team
finished 24th in the final collegiate rankings. The last time an
Ivy League team ranked that high probably was before World War II.

RAYTHEON TRIMS CONSTRUCTION UNIT; CHIEF RESIGNS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Raytheon Co. said Friday that it had laid off 1,500 workers from
its struggling engineering and construction unit, 500 more than the
company originally expected when it announced cutbacks at the
division in January.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Raytheon said that the head of the subsidiary had
resigned.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Q. Miller, the 52-year-old chairman and chief executive
of Raytheon Engineers &AMP; Constructors in Cambridge, Mass., quit ``to
pursue personal interests,'' the company said. The move casts a
further cloud over the unit's struggle to restructure amid a drop
in business.
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon appointed Shay D. Assad, 48, currently E&AMP;C's president
and chief operating officer and a 21-year company veteran, to
replace Miller on an acting basis. &UR;  &LR; Miller had been at
Lexington-based Raytheon for 24 years.
</P>
<P>
   The shake-up at E&AMP;C, which has been fighting to survive amid
defense industry cutbacks &UR;  &LR; and Asia's economic turmoil, comes just
one week after Raytheon selected Daniel P. Burnham, vice chairman
of aerospace giant AlliedSignal Inc., as president and future
successor to Raytheon chairman and chief executive Dennis Picard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chuck has made a personal decision to resign,'' Raytheon
spokesman Robert S. McWade said. He declined to say whether Miller,
who leaves on July 2, had been asked to leave &UR;  &LR; or &UR;  &LR; if his departure
was related to Burnham's appointment. Miller had been seen both
inside and outside the company as a potential successor to Picard.
</P>
<P>
   McWade, who said E&AMP;C had laid off 1,500 workers so far this
year, also declined to say if there would be further job losses at
the unit. The cuts are part of an across-the-board trimming of more
than 9 percent of Raytheon's total work force as the company seeks
to convert more of its defense technology into commercial
applications. &UR;  &LR; The company employees 119,000 overall.
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon, the world's third largest aerospace company, has
doubled in size in recent years through acquisitions of the defense
units of Texas Instruments Inc. and General Motors Corp.'s Hughes
Electronics.
</P>
<P>
   E&AMP;C faces a drop in its business of building and operating
large-scale industrial projects ranging from nuclear power plants
and airports to roads and food-processing facilities. Most of the
unit's customers are overseas, and Asia's woes have depressed

   WASHINGTON WATCH VOTE CHART Questions regarding this
transmission should be directed to 202-628-3100, ext. 216.
WASHINGTON, June 26 -- The following chart shows how senators and
house representatives voted on key bills and amendments in the last
week. A ``Y'' means the member voted for the measure; an ``N''
means the member voted against the measure; a ``?'' means the
member did not vote; and a ``P'' means the member voted
``present.''
</P>
<P>
   SENATE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: EDUCATION
</P>
<P>
   The Senate approved Wednesday, 59-36, legislation that would
allow tax-free education savings accounts for parents or
scholarship sponsors that could be used to defray school costs.
Supporters of the bill said it will lower education costs.
Opponents said that the bill will subsidize private school
education, help mostly the affluent and lead to public school
neglect. A ``yes'' vote favors the bill.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: MILITARY
</P>
<P>
   The Senate voted Thursday, 48-45, to pass an amendment to the
defense budget which would make it harder to shut down more
military bases. Supporters of the amendment said they want to
insure that Congress receives all the information it needs before
deciding to close bases. Opponents said the amendment sends the
message that protecting unnecessary bases and civilian jobs takes
precedence over military preparedness and personnel. A ``yes'' vote
favors the amendment.
</P>
<P>
   3) BILL NUMBER: DEFENSE
</P>
<P>
   The Senate approved, 88-4, the Pentagon's $270 billion budget
for fiscal year 1999. Supporters expressed satisfaction with what
the bill did for their individual states and for the nation as a
whole. Opponents voted against it for individual reasons. A ``yes''
vote favors the budget.

   HOUSE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: FINANCE
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, June 19, the House rejected, 155-254, an amendment to
a campaign finance bill. The measure would have wiped out the
entire reform bill if any of its provisions were declared
unconstitutional. Supporters said that if any part of the bill was
found unconstitutional, it would change the bill's character.
Opponents said the amendment would enable members not in favor of
campaign reform to add unconstitutional provisions for the sole
purpose of killing the bill. A ``yes'' vote favors the bill.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: ABORTION
</P>
<P>
   The House approved Wednesday, 223-254, an amendment to the
annual agricultural spending bill that would prohibit research
funding for the abortion-inducing pill, RU-486. Supporters of the
measure said that supporting research of life-taking substances was
unethical. Opponents said that the amendment infringed upon the
privacy of the patient to choose her treatment. A ``yes'' vote
favors the amendment.
</P>
<P>
   3) BILL NUMBER: IRSREFORM
</P>
<P>
   The House voted Thursday, 402-8, to pass an IRS overhaul and tax
bill. The measure would establish a citizens' oversight board and
increase taxpayer rights in collection disputes with the IRS.
Supporters said the bill would protect taxpayers from any abuse
from the tax agency. Opponents objected to changing the capital
gains holding period from 18 months to 12 months, calling it a tax
break for the wealthy. A ``yes'' vote favors the bill.

BAY STATE RECORDS STEEP DROP IN AIDS CASES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARIE C. SANCHEZ  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Officials this week reported an unprecedented 46
percent decline in new AIDS cases last year, and said they expect
continued progress as a result of the AIDS drugs, more prevention
efforts and a more finely tuned reporting system.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors reported 466 new cases of the disease last year,
compared to 863 the previous year. New cases have been dropping
steadily since 1993, but the annual decreases have been nowhere
near as steep as last year's
</P>
<P>
   ``Primarily,'' said Dr. Howard Koh, commisioner for the state
Department of Public Health, the decline in new cases is due to
``the new triple drug therapies and state of the art cocktails.''
Other factors he cited were ``better medical care of the entire
patient, access to care for HIV-positive individuals, and education
on safe sex, condoms, and needle exchange.''
</P>
<P>
   A new reporting system should also help, Koh said. Until now,
officials have tracked the spread of the deadly disease through new
diagnoses of the full-blown disease AIDS. However, last February,
public health officials acted to require tracking of the HIV
infection that precedes AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to get a handle on the number who are nowhere close to
AIDS,'' Koh said. ``The new surveillance system is going to be
really important.''
</P>
<P>
   Koh said he expects the system to be designed by fall and
implemented early next year. ``It will be one of the few in the
nation to use unique identifiers, not personal names,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want an environment where people feel they can trust the
medical system and have as many come forward as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Once doctors start reporting HIV _ not just full blown AIDS _
authorities will be able to track trends in infection and pinpoint
where prevention efforts are working, and where they are still
needed, he said.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, said Linda Warren-Kato, a spokesperson for the
state's AIDS bureau, public health officials ``can make sure we're
putting our prevention dollar where infection seems to be going,
and make sure our infrastructure is there for people who are going
to be needing them five, six, seven years down the line.''
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, the disease takes more than ten years to develop
from infection to AIDS diagnosis. And time is frequently lost
between infection and HIV testing.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, more than 13,600 people have full-blown AIDS.
And health department experts estimate there are more than 36,000
HIV-infected individuals, many of whom are unaware that they are
infected.
</P>
<P>
   African Americans have a disproportionate incidence of AIDS, Koh
said. While they make up just 5 percent of the state population, 32
percent of new AIDS diagnoses in 1997 were among African Americans,
an increase from 26 percent the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   There is particular fear among African Americans of finding out
HIV status, ``and fear of the stigma of HIV,'' Koh said. ``Our
message is that this disease is treatable and ultimately
preventable.''
</P>
<P>
   So Friday, Koh kicked off a mass media campaign to encourage
African Americans in particular to get free, confidential testing
in centers throughout the state. Through its ACT NOW program, the
state also offers free primary health care to people who are
uninsured, low-income, and HIV positive. They can call a special
Hotline at 1-888-I-ACT-NOW.

ANALYSIS: HARD FOR EITHER SIDE IN GM STRIKE TO CLAIM VICTORY 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By KEITH BRADSHER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   FLINT, Mich. _ Losses to General Motors Corp. and members of the
United Automobile Workers union from strikes at two parts factories
here have soared far beyond the actual money involved at the
factories, making it harder with each passing day for either side
to paint an eventual settlement as a victory.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street analysts now estimate GM's after-tax costs from the
strikes at $1 billion, and rising by $75 million a day, while the
UAW's members have lost more than $150 million in pay.
</P>
<P>
   Based on previous strikes, GM and its workers can expect to
recoup up to half their losses through extra production and
overtime pay in the months after the strikes. But the rest of the
losses are likely to be permanent, as customers buy Ford
Expeditions and Toyota Camrys instead of Chevrolet Suburbans and
Luminas.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the issues in the Flint strike negotiations involve
sums in the tens of millions of dollars. But as the strikes
lengthen, each side has also begun to see them as a showdown over
the future course of labor-management relations at the world's
largest automaker, making it much harder to settle.
</P>
<P>
   For the UAW to declare victory after the strikes, it must be
able to reassure members that it is doing as much as possible to
slow GM's steady elimination of jobs in the United States. But the
union faces a difficult task in controlling the expectations of
workers who, much more than the union's leadership, see the strikes
as a way to force GM to back away from its plans to expand
production overseas.
</P>
<P>
   GM faces a more difficult task. It must convince skeptical
institutional investors and Wall Street analysts that a settlement
in Flint will allow it to shrink its work force at other factories
without further costly strikes. ``I want to be able to sleep at
night knowing that GM can downsize without having a strike,'' said
Nicholas Lobaccaro, an auto analyst at Merrill Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   Companies with steady increases in earnings, quarter after
quarter, have been rewarded by Wall Street with fast-rising share
prices. Mainly because of 16 strikes over the last five years, GM's
quarterly earnings have zigzagged unpredictably, with record
profits alternating with heavy losses.
</P>
<P>
   With the UAW now threatening strikes in Indiana and Ohio after
any settlement in Flint, GM's stock has been weakening, and its
price has dropped 11.4 percent since the first strike June 5, even
as the share price at its rival Ford Motor Co. has risen 6.2
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street analysts assert that GM needs to shrink its work
force because the automaker's uninspiring designs are capturing a
shrinking share of the market. GM held 40 percent of the market a
decade ago but has been bouncing around 30 percent in the last
year.
</P>
<P>
   That means GM needs to produce about 1.5 million fewer vehicles
even in good years, so fewer workers are needed. GM closed some
factories during the last recession in the early 1990s, but still
has the manufacturing capacity and work force to supply 35 percent
of the market, rather than 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Auto analysts look at these figures and want the strikes to end
with an acknowledgment by the UAW that GM is in trouble. ``What is
necessary is a public recognition by the union leadership, that is
communicated to the rank and file, that GM's situation is serious
enough that we need to all collectively work together to put the
company back on a competitive footing,'' said Joseph Phillippi at
Lehman Brothers, who predicted Friday that the strikes could last
at least until mid-August.
</P>
<P>
   GM has taken the unusual step in the strikes of publicly
criticizing the union's leadership in a bid to convince UAW members
that the company has a problem. Thursday, GM gave local television
stations a videotape in which a top Flint factory manager explained
how inefficient work practices cost the company money.
</P>
<P>
   This strategy has predictably infuriated top UAW officials, who
were angry at GM even before the strike. Union leaders have said
for months that workers are punished for bad decision making by GM
executives, such as the company's only now getting around to
developing a sport utility vehicle and a mid-size sedan for Saturn,
its most successful brand. The union has also been upset that GM is
trying to cut costs while still making some profits and paying top
executives large bonuses.
</P>
<P>
   The confrontational stance of GM executives has been the last
straw for the union. ``You've got some heroes in GM that are all of
a sudden becoming stars and want to talk about they're going to do
this and do that _ they're just not making any sense whatsoever,''
said UAW president Stephen Yokich on Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
   But the union's only weapon for fighting the company is a blunt
one that hurts workers, too. A strong economy appears to have
produced very strong auto sales this month, and GM dealerships had
scant supplies of popular models when the strikes began. GM faces
further loss of market share this summer for lack of cars and light
trucks to sell. The strikes also threaten to delay GM's
introduction this fall of new full-size pickup trucks, a mainstay
of its profits.
</P>
<P>
   And union leaders in Brazil warned Friday that some huge and
highly profitable factories there might have to close soon for lack
of parts from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Workers on the picket lines in Flint recognize the costs of the
strikes on all sides and are worried about the eventual settlement.
``I don't think anybody's going to win,'' said one, Doris Motley,
an operator of computerized stamping equipment. ``They'll
compromise, but that's about it.'' &QL;

RELIGION COLUMN: CHAMPION OF INTERFAITH COOPERATION IS HONORED 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By PETER STEINFELS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Doesn't Sir Sigmund Sternberg, the British
businessman, Jewish philanthropist and inveterate promoter of
interfaith understanding, ever get tired of receiving awards?
</P>
<P>
   It may not have been the most diplomatic question to ask Sir
Sigmund, who was in New York for a ceremony at the United Nations
honoring him for receiving the $1.23 million Templeton Prize for
Progress in Religion, but it also seemed unavoidable.
</P>
<P>
   Last March, when Sir Sigmund was named this year's Templeton
Prize winner, his biographical fact sheet listed more knighthoods
than there were at King Arthur's Round Table, and enough
``commanders'' and ``orders of merit'' to supply an imperial army.
The honors came from Poland, Spain, Austria, Germany, Hungary,
Greece, Sweden, Israel and the Vatican as well, of course, as
Britain and any number of international organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Charles W. Bell of The New York Daily News York noted, ``If he
wore all his decorations, Sir Sigmund Sternberg would look like a
comic opera admiral.''
</P>
<P>
   And Clifford Longley, a longtime religion writer in Britain,
once said of Sir Sigmund that ``an important part of his social
life seems to consist of giving and receiving medals and honors,''
adding, however, that ``he has the great merit of not taking any
part of it too seriously, though seriously enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is pretty much the way he responded Thursday morning in a
hotel room overlooking the United Nations building and the East
River. ``I don't look at these as though they were given to me, but
to the cause,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The cause is building the kind of contact and cooperation among
religious groups that the Hungarian-born Sir Sigmund is convinced
could have prevented the Nazi-led anti-Jewish drive from achieving
the horrors of the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not consider myself in any way more worthy than many
others,'' he said. ``I'm just lucky.''
</P>
<P>
   And practical, too. For Sir Sigmund. awards are another means to
an end. He has often told a story about his efforts, ultimately
successful, to get a group of Polish Carmelite nuns to move from
the convent they had established on the perimeter of the Auschwitz
concentration camp site. When he sought to speak to the nuns
directly, he found that they had never heard of Sir Sigmund
Sternberg. But a crumpled photograph of him standing next to Pope
John Paul II and wearing all the regalia of the knighthood the pope
had bestowed on him became his entry card for a face-to-face
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, the only sign of Sir Sigmund's honors was the red and
gold rosetta of his papal knighthood worn in the lapel of a blue
blazer. He looked not a bit the comic opera admiral, but a
77-year-old businessman of slight build and medium height who sang
the praises of swimming (and the hotel pool) as his means of
keeping fit.
</P>
<P>
   The Sternberg fortune began with salvaging scrap metal in World
War II and eventually expanded into real estate and computer
software. Asked how a business leader approached interfaith
relations, he said, ``Business calls it negotiations, and religion
calls it dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it all comes to one thing: communications,'' he added.
``I'm not a theologian or academic, but as a businessman, I'm
probably more flexible. This skill in negotiation has probably been
of help to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Sir Sigmund wants to mobilize the same skills in others. The
text of the speech he prepared for Friday night's ceremony called
``for those of us who are both in business and have a religious
faith _ if I may use the phrase _ to come out of the closet.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Sir Sigmund helped found the Institute of Business
Ethics, which has joined in supporting an earlier effort at drawing
up an interfaith code of ethics for international business based on
Christian, Muslim and Jewish teachings.
</P>
<P>
   Sir Sigmund, a longtime supporter of the Labor Party (he
included praise for British Prime Minister Tony Blair in the text
of Friday night's remarks), wants union leaders ``welcomed on equal
terms'' in this search for common spiritual and ethical guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   But his enthusiasm for nurturing like-minded spirits in the
business world does not exhaust his attention. On Thursday, the
conversation skipped from the new Councils of Christians and Jews
that he helped get under way in Eastern Europe, most recently in
Ukraine, to the Three Faiths Forum he founded with Muslim and
Christian leaders to expand the Christian-Jewish dialogue to
embrace Islam and foster a genuine three-part discussion.
</P>
<P>
   Aware that believers sometimes have more trouble talking amiably
to differing members of their own religion than with members of
other faiths, he has floated the wry suggestion of starting a
British ``Council of Jews and Jews.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And here is something that hasn't been reported yet,'' he
said, with the air of a man who knows journalists' susceptibility
to any scrap of novelty: A monument to Raoul Wallenberg, the
Swedish diplomat who saved the lives of 100,000 Jews in
Nazi-occupied Hungary, will be unveiled in Buenos Aires next
November. The monument, which is part of Sir Sigmund's efforts on
behalf of Wallenberg's memory, replicates one that Queen Elizabeth
II unveiled in London last year.
</P>
<P>
   Talk of the Buenos Aires monument led to Sir Sigmund's role on a
commission investigating past Nazi activities in Argentine and the
agreement of the Argentine Catholic Church to open its relevant
archives, which, in turn, led to his interest in getting the
Vatican to open archives about the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   In a message prepared for the ceremony Friday night, U.N.
Secretary General Kofi Annan, who is married to Wallenberg's niece,
recalled participating in the unveiling of the London monument and
how ``it forced me to dwell on difficult questions''-''the dark
side of human history.''
</P>
<P>
   The world is now ``in an era in which identity politics based on
religious and ethnicity have intensified, and in which intolerance
still finds its way into textbooks and official pronouncements,''
Annan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is remarkable individuals such as Sir Sigmund who represent
the correct and countervailing trend,'' he concluded, ``who give us
hope for the future.''

NORWAY PROPOSES $60 MILLION COMPENSATION FOR JEWS WRONGED DURING
WWII

<P>
   OSLO, Norway _ Norway has proposed a $60 million payment to
Norwegian Jews and international Jewish organizations as
compensation for property seized during World War II, the
government announced Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Norway as a nation should take collective responsibility for
what happened in our country during World War II,'' Justice
Minister Aud-Inger Aure said. ``I see it as our duty to seek a
broad, moral reconciliation and to let this be expressed
economically.''
</P>
<P>
   Before and during five years of German occupation, most of
Norway's 2,100 Jews fled to neutral Sweden. About 750 were deported
to Nazi concentration camps, where all but a handful died.
</P>
<P>
   The small number of Jews who returned after the war were given
their houses back, but most of their possessions had been
confiscated or auctioned off by the collaborationist regime of
Vidkun Quisling. Some items were taken by neighbors and never
returned.
</P>
<P>
   Today's Jewish population numbers 1,200, of whom at least
several hundred apparently qualify for compensation.
</P>
<P>
   Elan Steinberg, executive director of the World Jewish Congress,
called the Norwegian proposal a ``shining example of moral
decency.'' He said he hoped that it would be an example for other
European countries wrestling with the issue of complicity with the
Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are 16 national commissions investigating the issue of
Holocaust era assets,'' Steinberg said. ``Norway is the first to
announce a comprehensive compensation package. It has confronted
its past honestly, the dark chapters as well as the heroic
chapters, so that it can have an honorable future.''
</P>
<P>
   Norway's centrist coalition government sent the settlement
proposal to Parliament, which is expected to approve it with little
or no opposition in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   A committee that investigated the wartime confiscations
concluded in a majority report last fall that $15 million would be
appropriate compensation. But two dissenting members declared that
the majority had failed to grasp the complexity of what Norwegian
Jews had faced.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Kjell Magne Bondevik, an ordained Lutheran
minister, accepted the minority report as the basis for settlement.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement proposal is divided into two parts: some $33
million for Jewish organizations and Holocaust studies in Norway
and abroad, and up to $27 million for Jewish survivors of the war
and their children who can show that family belongings were lost
during the occupation of Norway. Individuals will be eligible for
about $27,000 each.
</P>
<P>
   In this relatively unlitigious country, it was not legal
pressure that led to a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Katz, chairman of the Norwegian Jewish Community, said
the initiative started three years ago when a doctoral student
uncovered aspects of the German occupation not previously discussed
and the government appointed an investigative committee.
</P>
<P>
   Julius Paltiel, 73, of Trondheim spent three years in Auschwitz
and Buchenwald and lost his entire family there. Just before the
war ended, in a deal with the collapsing Nazi regime, the Swedish
Red Cross rescued more than 500 Scandinavian prisoners from
Buchenwald.
</P>
<P>
   But it was recently documented by Norway's state television that
the only five Jews in the group were left behind. Among them was
Paltiel, who marched to the Danish border and eventually made his
way back to Trondheim alone.
</P>
<P>
   The postwar Norwegian government provided $2,600 to make up for
his lost household belongings but nothing for his family's clothing
store, which had been run by Nazi sympathizers and laid bare.
</P>
<P>
   Paltiel says he looks forward to giving most of the new
restitution to his grandchildren. ``Whatever the amount is,'' he
said, ``it was nothing that we asked for at all. It just comes as a
gift from heaven.''

LOUNES MATOUB, 42, IS KILLED; SANG TO PROMOTE BERBER CAUSE 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By CRAIG R. WHITNEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Lounes Matoub, a popular Algerian singer and Berber
patriot who was kidnapped by Muslim militants in Algeria four years
ago but was freed and had lived mostly in France since, was killed
in an ambush near his hometown east of Algiers on Thursday. He was
42.
</P>
<P>
   News of his death, apparently at the hands of Islamic
fundamentalists, brought expressions of grief from the large
Algerian and Berber communities in France and tributes from French
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Violent armed conflict between fundamentalists and the
military-backed government in Algeria, a former colony that fought
its way to independence from France in 1962, has taken an estimated
70,000 lives in the past six years. Matoub's art denounced both
sides.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a man who was the voice of Algeria, loud and clear,''
President Jacques Chirac of France said during a visit to southern
Africa, ``and I hope this voice will continue to be heard.''
</P>
<P>
   Demonstrators marched Friday through the streets of Tizi-Ouzou,
near his hometown in the Kabylia region of Algeria, and chanted
``Zeroual, assassin!'' blaming Algeria's President, Liamine
Zeroual, for Matoub's death, Reuters reported. Riot police officers
dispersed the marchers, who threw stones at them.
</P>
<P>
   His death came shortly before the introduction of a law in
Algeria, to take effect early next month, making Arabic the
country's sole official language _ a step he and other Berber
patriots had resisted as a blow to other native languages.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of thousands of the Berbers, a minority of several
million in a country of 30 million, saw him as an enemy of both the
Islamic fundamentalists and of the authorities.
</P>
<P>
   The civil war in Algeria began after the authorities in Algiers
canceled elections in 1992 that radical Islamic parties were
expected to win. In his songs, in Arabic and in the Kabyle language
of the Berbers, Matoub expressed bitterness at the killing and love
for the land where he was born, in direct and sometimes earthy
language that Islamic purists regarded as decadent.
</P>
<P>
   Islamic militants kidnapped him near Tizi-Ouzou in September
1994 and held him for more than two weeks. More than 100,000 people
demonstrated there then to demand his freedom, and he was liberated
in a cafe. He said the Armed Islamic Group, one of the most radical
of the fundamentalist groups, had condemned him to death for his
songs.
</P>
<P>
   He came to France three months later and gave two sold-out
concerts in Paris before leaving again to sing in Kabylia, but had
lived most of the time since in France, returning to Algeria only a
few weeks ago.

<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ When finance ministers and investment strategists have
nightmares these days, they often involve huge financial
institutions whose names are hardly household words in the West.
</P>
<P>
   Yet if names like Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank or Ashikaga Bank trip on
Western tongues, there is a growing apprehension that Japanese
financial institutions like them may threaten the long boom on Wall
Street and even the stability of the global economy.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's economy is in recession, its stock market has lost 60
percent of its value since the peak eight years ago, and its
currency has cascaded 43 percent from its high point in 1995. There
is increasing agreement in world financial capitals that the
problems center on something the Japanese government is only
beginning to confront: the mountain of bad debts at the nation's
banks.
</P>
<P>
   Now there is an emerging sense that the next few weeks may mark
a turning point for the banking crisis _ and, indirectly, for the
global economy to which it is connected.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation in Japan is a source of very considerable
concern,'' Lawrence Summers, the U.S. deputy treasury secretary,
said in Washington after his return this week from a trip to Japan
during which he sought to make Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto
face up to the debt crisis. Summers added that this was a ``pivotal
moment for Asia and the global economy.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. policy-makers fear that Japan is a weak link in the
international economy. Burdened by bad debts arising from a
property market that has tumbled as much as 90 percent, some of
Japan's largest banks are in a tenuous position. Merger talks
involving Long-Term Credit Bank, one of the most troubled
institutions, and Sumitomo Trust &AMP; Banking Co. Ltd., a somewhat
stronger bank, were confirmed Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Hashimoto says that the solution to the problem is what he
describes as the ``Total Plan.'' That is somewhat of a misnomer,
for at this stage the plan is neither total nor fully formed. It is
instead a vague idea of peeling bad loans off bank books and
reselling them in the marketplace, much as the United States
tackled the savings and loan crisis of the late 1980s by empowering
Resolution Trust Corp. to sell off bad assets from the thrifts.
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece of the Total Plan would be the creation of a
``bridge bank'' that would take over the loan portfolios of failing
banks, selling off good loans and laying to rest bad ones. The
bridge bank would also look after customers of failing
institutions, offering them a bridge so they could get by
temporarily until they were able to establish a relationship with
another bank.
</P>
<P>
   Hashimoto said that he would summon Parliament for a special
session late next month to pass legislation on the plan. The
question being asked increasingly by bankers, diplomats and
businessmen is no longer whether Hashimoto will act. It is whether
he will do enough, and whether the proposed cure will rescue the
Japanese economy or cripple it with more government intervention.
</P>
<P>
   ``The politicians are certainly starting to talk volubly about
something having to be done even before the elections,'' said
Minoru Makihara, the chairman of Mitsubishi Corp., referring to
parliamentary elections on July 12. ``That is something that they
didn't talk about earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now whether that will materialize or not, I don't know,''
Makihara added. ``But at least the situation seems to have moved in
the direction of action.'' William Seidman, former head of
Resolution Trust Corp., is advising Japanese politicians on the
banking crisis. ``I told them that there's no way they can do this
harmoniously,'' he said. ``It will involve some pain.''
</P>
<P>
   Japanese banks are only dimly understood in the West, yet they
are colossal _ the biggest bank in the world is Bank of
Tokyo-Mitsubishi, with more than $550 billion in total assets,
compared with less than $400 billion for Chase Manhattan Corp., the
biggest in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In a few cases, the Japanese banks are tottering. It was the
frailty of these vast institutions that led President Clinton and
Hashimoto to order joint intervention in the currency markets last
week to bolster the yen.
</P>
<P>
   There is concern not simply about the collapse of any individual
bank or the difficulties of its depositors, but rather about the
consequences for the entire economic structure. In an increasingly
globalized economy, there is a possibility that bank runs could
trigger a liquidity crisis that could race around the world in
minutes, sending markets plunging and ultimately provoking an
international economic slowdown.
</P>
<P>
   Nervousness about Japanese banks is in large part responsible
for the decline of the yen. The joint intervention on June 17
bolstered the yen initially, but now it is slipping again. If the
yen falls further, it could escalate the Asian financial crisis to
a new level, particularly if China moves to devalue its currency.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's big banks tend to all suffer from similar problems. All
have far more bad debt than would be acceptable in the United
States, but some are stronger than others. Bad loans as a
percentage of equity range from 90 percent at Sanwa to 371 percent
at Nippon Credit Bank _ compared with an average of 58 percent at
the 22 largest U.S. banks during the height of the American savings
and loan crisis in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Among the stronger banks, Sumitomo is a part owner of Goldman,
Sachs, while Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, which is listed on the New
York Stock Exchange, is viewed as fundamentally sound.

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Anxieties have been raised in the last couple of weeks over the
status of Long-Term Credit Bank, a venerable institution set up
after World War II to provide long-term loans to help finance the
nation's economic rebuilding.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, the government dealt with ailing banks by merging
them with stronger ones. The current banking landscape is a
kaleidoscope of banks piled upon banks.
</P>
<P>
   Long-Term Credit's quest has almost been a round robin,
reportedly including talks with several institutions, including
Nippon Credit Bank, itself essentially bailed out more than a year
ago when the government injected new capital; and with Dai-Ichi
Kangyo, itself the result of a rescue merger between Dai-Ichi Bank
and Nippon Kangyo Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Other market-moving reports said that Long-Term Credit was
turning to the ailing Daiwa Bank. American regulators ordered
Daiwa's U.S. operations shut down in 1995, after a bond trader
incurred more than $1 billion in losses and then tried, along with
the bank, to cover up the losses.
</P>
<P>
   Long-Term Credit may have found a match. On Friday, it confirmed
that it was discussing a possible merger with Sumitomo Trust &AMP;
Banking, a smaller bank specializing in money management for
institutional investors that has been forging ties with foreign
firms like Citibank.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone gets rescued, as Yamaichi Securities, a brokerage,
discovered when it went under last November. Then, Fuji Bank _ a
giant, somewhat wobbly bank that is also the government's paying
agent _ was Yamaichi's main banker, and its decision not to save
Yamaichi was considered rational by the market.
</P>
<P>
   But a few months later, tradition got the better of Fuji when it
stepped forward to support Yasuda Trust &AMP; Banking, an ailing trust
bank in Fuji's group of companies.
</P>
<P>
   How did Japan's banks come to be so weak?
</P>
<P>
   During the ``bubble economy'' of the late 1980s, Japanese land
prices soared to ridiculous levels, and it was said that the
Imperial Palace grounds in central Tokyo were worth as much as all
of California. Japanese banks went on a lending spree, expanding
their loan portfolios by $3.6 trillion _ a figure equivalent to 72
percent of the entire Japanese economy _ and in many cases taking
buildings as collateral.
</P>
<P>
   The real-estate market collapsed under its own weight, and the
value of Japanese land plunged, with prime properties in downtown
Tokyo falling to perhaps 10 percent of their peak values. The
result is that perhaps $600 billion in loans may be unrecoverable.
</P>
<P>
   Banks have been reluctant to sell property at these prices, so
there is almost no active real-estate market today. No one quite
knows the market price or the true level of bad loans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market is very inactive,'' said Teizo Taya, a managing
director at Daiwa Institute of Research. ``There are no buyers.''
</P>
<P>
   The government did little about the loans for eight years,
thinking that if property prices rose again, the problem would
right itself. And indeed, if the collateral was again worth more
than the property, the bad loans would become good. But the
direction of the market is uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see a quick turnaround,'' said Osamu Aoi, director at
Eiwa Real Estate Co. ``I'm covering the downside. I'm very
pessimistic. You have to have maximum pessimism toward Japanese
real estate in order to survive.''
</P>
<P>
   Another problem haunting the banking system _ and making it
difficult to resolve the crisis _ is that lending in Japan has been
a murky process. Loan documents are short and scanty, if they exist
at all, and bankers often performed little analysis on the
creditworthiness of the borrower or on the viability of the
project.
</P>
<P>
   Often they lent simply on relationships, or because they owned
shares in the companies asking for loans. That in turn makes
collecting on bad loans a bit awkward.
</P>
<P>
   ``The banks have been avoiding drastic change,'' said Heizo
Takenaka, professor of economics at Keio University. ``Even the
president of a bank doesn't understand his own loan portfolio.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, the banks have been reluctant to write off bad loans,
partly because they do not have enough in profits or in capital to
absorb those losses. ``They have a lot of loans on their books at
the original value and they may have to write them off at 20 to 30
cents on the dollar,'' said Robert Hormats, vice chairman of
Goldman, Sachs International. ``They don't want to acknowledge the
fact that 70 to 80 percent of the value of those loans has
disappeared.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the banks are reluctant to foreclose on loans,
seizing property, evicting clients and being publicly branded as
heartless capitalists.
</P>
<P>
   Some bankers also are afraid of foreclosing on properties
occupied by anyone affiliated with the Yakuza, the Japanese mafia,
who have set up shop in many buildings that are the collateral for
loans.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, an executive director in the Nagoya branch of Sumitomo
Bank, one of Japan's most innovative and largest banks, was fatally
shot. News reports suggested that his murder may have been related
to efforts to collect on bad loans related to the Yakuza.
</P>
<P>
   The bad-loan crisis has done more than create risks for the
future. It has also had direct effects on Japan's economy,
exacerbating the recent recession.
</P>
<P>
   The most alarming problem for many ordinary Japanese businesses
has been a credit squeeze throughout the country. Banks are calling
loans from small and medium-sized businesses, or even from the
affiliates of their big clients, and this is crimping investment
and making the economic outlook less favorable.
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, the credit squeeze has been intensified by the
government's efforts to liberalize the banking sector. The
government has been trying to restructure the financial industry,
imposing stricter rules and embarking on a broad program of
liberalization, called the Big Bang. In the process of preparing
for these changes, Japanese banks have been trying to trim their
assets to meet capital-adequacy requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Ohta, a general manager in charge of treasury at NEC Corp.
said that liquidity ``is the most important problem a Japanese
corporate treasurer faces.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ohta said that NEC assured its access to financing by
turning to Citibank, which arranged a syndicated loan. Ohta said,
``Liquidity is a problem we haven't experienced for a long time.''

NEW JERSEY MOVES TO TAKE OVER CAMDEN'S FINANCES 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In an unprecedented intervention into local affairs, Gov.
Christie Whitman has proposed that New Jersey officials take
control of virtually all of Camden's financial dealings.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal, included in the pending $18 billion state budget
approved by Senate and Assembly committees Thursday, would
establish a seven-member financial review board appointed by the
governor with sweeping powers over Camden's budget, labor contracts
and borrowing plans.
</P>
<P>
   If approved by the full Legislature on Monday, the proposal
could eventually give the board daily control of Camden's spending.
The proposal would allow the city to retain control of its welfare
department, which state officials had tried to hand over to the
county.
</P>
<P>
   With an unemployment rate of nearly 14 percent, almost triple
the state average, and a per-capita income of $7,276, the lowest in
the state, Camden is in dire need of a financial recovery plan,
officials say. During the last four years, the state has given
almost $50 million in aid to Camden, more than half of the city's
total budget in that period, and the Whitman administration has
moved to seize control of the city's finances to insure that this
level of support does not continue to be necessary, said Jane
Kenny, commissioner of the state Department of Community Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   While Ms. Kenny said that the state had never before tried to
delve so deeply into municipal finances, she balked at the notion
that Camden, a city of 85,000, would effectively become state-run.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if we have far-reaching power,'' she said, ``we intend to
work with Camden.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   While city officials said they would welcome advice from the
state, they contended that the governor's proposal seeks too much
control.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want our city government to be under the thumb of any
outside entity,'' said Keith Walker, assistant business
administrator for the city. ``We don't need a stern father figure
looking over our shoulder. We need a compassionate brother or
sister.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker said the city and state had initially discussed the
creation of a ``financial recovery team'' composed of visiting
state officials, who would bring their expertise and talents to
Camden to guide the city to fiscal solvency. But Walker said the
proposal was discarded in favor of the more stringent review board
after much discussion.
</P>
<P>
   Camden is no stranger to intervention from outside governmental
bodies. Last summer, the federal government seized control of the
city's housing authority, claiming that scores of public-housing
residents lived in deplorable conditions. In 1996, Whitman sent a
detachment of state troopers to Camden to help the Police
Department patrol the streets after a rash of murders.
</P>
<P>
   But some officials in Camden called the proposed review board
excessive.
</P>
<P>
   It would deprive residents of their right to elect their own
representatives, said state Sen. Wayne Bryant, a Democrat who
unsuccessfully fought the governor's plan in Thursday's voting
session. By placing Camden's crippled economy in the hands of
outsiders who have yet to come up with a clear recovery plan, the
proposal would also perpetuate the city's economic woes, he said. &QL;

COMMENTARY: PARENTS SEEK ANSWERS AT TROUBLED MIDDLE SCHOOL 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By DAVID GONZALEZ    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The final seventh-grade report card Moises Ayala
received Friday from Middle School 136 in Brooklyn had enough 55's
on it that it resembled a decent regional weather forecast for the
fall. His mother, Marlin Mazier, did not have to look at it to know
what it really predicted for September. She had decided weeks ago
to yank her son from the Sunset Park school and make him repeat the
seventh grade in a local parochial school.
</P>
<P>
   During the two years that Moises has been at the troubled public
school _ where only a third of the students read at or above grade
level _ he has shown little improvement. That was despite his
having been placed in a different class earlier this year, where
she hoped he would get more attention. But it came too late, she
said, and she grew anxious that he would just be passed on to the
next grade. He wasn't, but Ms. Mazier had already made up her mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm taking him out of that school because two years were
wasted,'' she said. ``My son doesn't have another two years to
waste. I don't feel he has more time left. Not if the same teachers
are going to be there. I'm not going to take a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   She used to think that maybe it was just her problem, until she
became active in Brooklyn Interfaith for Action, a community
advocacy group that in recent years has begun to question the
quality of education and other public services. In the group, she
met parents whose children had also faced repeated frustrating
failures at MS 136 and other local schools. With mixed results,
they have since been after the principal and district
superintendent to meet with them to give them answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If your child can't read, you think it's just your child,''
Ms. Mazier said. ``But almost 70 percent of them are not reading at
grade level. It's got to be something more. I know my son's not
perfect, but it has to be something deeper.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, as they have learned, working outside the usual channels of
the Parent-Teacher Association is not easy. Their group is
affiliated with the Industrial Areas Foundation, known for its
confrontational style of grass-roots organizing that trains
neighborhood residents to understand and identify community
problems and hold public officials accountable.
</P>
<P>
   The group had met in late March with Francis DeStefano, the
superintendent of District 15. They said he promised to follow up
with reports on the school's progress, as well as help them arrange
a meeting with principals at other schools. Members of the group
said that they still have difficulty getting through to principals
and that DeStefano has yet to deliver on his follow-up meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Lawrence, executive assistant to the superintendent,
said he has been focusing much of his attention on the school,
which has been on the state's list of troubled schools since 1994.
She said that a recently completed plan to restructure the school
was praised by state authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lawrence said that while the PTA had been informed about
these moves, she was unsure about the motives of the members of
BIA.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know who they represent,'' she said. ``They have not
indicated exactly what's their intent or how they can help the
school. They have not involved themselves in the PTA or schoolwide
meetings.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it is because when they have gone to meet with some
teachers and administrators, they feel they have been either talked
down to or ignored. Elizabeth Cubero still bristles at how one of
her son's teachers suggested she place the child in a behavior
modification class and put him on Ritalin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just got up and walked out,'' Ms. Cubero said. ``My son does
not have a mental problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mazier said she once asked another teacher about her son's
curriculum. ``She looked at me like I had four faces,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Both women attended MS 136 themselves in the 1970s, and
remembered it as a school where education was no-nonsense and
teachers took extra time to help them. Now they want to help, too,
by having a say in how projects are created and funds are
distributed.
</P>
<P>
   They want their children to get the same kind of attention young
people in better-off communities receive, rather than being pushed
through grade school to become future high school dropouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to get to know the teachers and principals,'' Ms.
Cubero said. ``Why is it so difficult? Then they complain about no
parent involvement.'' &QL;

BUSH SPARES LIFE OF CONVICTED KILLER LUCAS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JAMES PINKERTON 
and KATHY WALT 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROWNSVILLE, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush, in an extraordinary
move Friday, spared the life of convicted murderer Henry Lee Lucas,
but promised that the 61-year-old former drifter would remain
imprisoned until the day he dies.
</P>
<P>
   Bush followed the recommendation of the Texas Board of Pardons
and Paroles and commuted Lucas' death sentence for the 1979 slaying
dubbed ``Orange Socks'' to life imprisonment. Bush added, though,
that Lucas' newly commuted sentence would not begin until after all
five of his other life sentences are served.
</P>
<P>
   ``Henry Lee Lucas is unquestionably guilty of other despicable
crimes for which he has been sentenced to spend the rest of his
life in prison,'' Bush said. ``However, I believe there is enough
doubt about this particular crime that the state of Texas should
not impose its ultimate penalty by executing him.
</P>
<P>
   ``And he should not walk out free again,'' he added. ``This is a
bad guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Notified of the governor's decision, Lucas said from death row:
``I can only thank them for believing the truth and having guts
enough for standing up for what's right.''
</P>
<P>
   The parole board voted 17-1 Thursday to recommend that Bush take
such action. Board chairman Victor Rodriguez said a 1985
investigative report by then-Attorney General Jim Mattox carried
significant weight in convincing the board that Lucas' death
sentence was inappropriate.
</P>
<P>
   Mattox's investigation _ undertaken after news reports cast
doubt on the veracity of some 600 slayings around the country to
which Lucas confessed _ determined it was unlikely that Lucas
committed the slaying for which he was sentenced to die. Work time
sheets and a cashed check indicate that Lucas was in Florida when
the young woman was slain.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Dan Morales later reached the same conclusion,
although his office had been prepared to carry out the legal battle
to see that Lucas was executed.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said that Lucas' case is the first one in the 80 he has
reviewed since becoming governor that has raised doubt in his mind
about the condemned person's guilt.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been no doubt, no doubt in my mind up until this,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he was reluctant to second guess a jury and the
courts, but he added that the jury ``did not know and could not
have known'' in 1984 when they sentenced Lucas to death about his
``pattern of lying and confessing to crimes that evidence later
proved he did not commit. Today's knowledge about his pattern of
lies raises doubt.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucas had been scheduled to die by lethal injection Tuesday for
the 1979 rape and strangulation of a young woman, who remains
unidentified. Her body was found in a ditch along Interstate 35
near Georgetown, north of Austin. The case was named for the only
item of clothing the victim was wearing when her body was found. It
is the only murder for which Lucas was ever given a death sentence.
He has been convicted in eight other murders in Texas and one in
West Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas gained notoriety in the 1980s after he confessed to some
600 murders around the country, but he later recanted those
confessions. He said he confessed to make a mockery of police and
because they fed him sufficient details about the crimes that he
could confess in detail.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a supporter of the death penalty for those who commit
horrible crimes, I feel a special obligation to make sure the state
of Texas never executes a person for a crime they may not have
committed,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Williamson County District Attorney Ken Anderson, whose
predecessor prosecuted Lucas in the ``Orange Socks'' case, remained
outraged at the decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has all originated from one big lie,'' Anderson said.
``The lie is that the information about Lucas' work records and
bank deposits, which the defense tried to use as his alibi, are
new. All of that was given to the jury to consider years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Some jurors in that case agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Lucas) is pulling everyone's strings and probably laughing
while he's doing it,'' said Mary Ann Desrosiers of San Angelo.
``It's a crying shame. There really hasn't been any new evidence
that we haven't considered.
</P>
<P>
   ``The possibility that he could have been out of town at the
time of the murder was brought up. But the overwhelming amount of
other evidence (proved) that he was guilty.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucas was tried in San Angelo on a change of venue.
</P>
<P>
   With Lucas' date with death now canceled, Texas Department of
Criminal Justice spokesman Glen Castlebury said Lucas would be
moved from death row at the Ellis I Unit outside Huntsville to the
Diagnostic Unit, where he will be assigned a new prison number and
a new unit. Castlebury was uncertain when that move would occur.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas' attorneys said they were relieved that their client had
been vindicated, but disappointed it took so long.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is disappointing and discouraging that we came so close to
an execution given the substantial doubts that have surrounded this
case since 1986,'' attorneys Rita Radostitz of Austin and Danny
Burns of Fort Worth said in a prepared statement.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile Mattox, who is seeking re-election as the Democratic
nominee for attorney general, applauded Bush's decision, saying it
was politically risky but will ``make our death penalty punishment
stronger than ever.''
</P>
<P>
   Mattox's Republican opponent, though, former Texas Supreme Court
Justice John Cornyn, disagreed with Bush's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have confidence both in the jury who heard the case and in
the more than 23 judges who reviewed the evidence,'' Cornyn said.
``I believe their decisions should be respected and their sentence
carried out.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, however, said that ``the clemency process is intended as a
fail safe for unusual or exceptional circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucas remains convicted of eight other Texas murders for which
he is serving five life sentences plus 210 years. He also has a
life sentence without the possibility of parole for a West Virginia
killing, but his confession to that crime also has been called
bogus.
</P>
<P>
   If Lucas were ever to be released from a Texas prison, he could
also be sent to Colorado or Florida where he is a suspect in at
least four other murder cases.

BROOKLYN LANDLORD FACES INVESTIGATION OVER SERVICE COMPANIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (ps) 
 By RANDY KENNEDY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Over the last 20 years, the families at Bedford
Gardens, a sprawling Brooklyn apartment complex, have grown
accustomed to seeing the name Kraus at every turn.
</P>
<P>
   Their rent checks go to Kraus Management, they are watched over
by uniformed guards from Kraus Security. When their toilets break,
Kraus Maintenance fixes them, and when they fall behind on rent,
the stern letters have often come from the law firm of Kraus &AMP;
Kraus.
</P>
<P>
   Presiding over this growing empire of companies is Herman I.
Kraus, a tall, methodical 70-year-old lawyer who grew up in a
working-class family a few blocks to the north. Not only do Kraus'
companies make millions by serving the complex, but he is also its
principal owner.
</P>
<P>
   Year after year, through legal maneuvering and sheer tenacity,
he has managed to award his own companies almost every major
contract to operate and maintain the 639-apartment complex, which
gets more than $3 million a year from the federal government in
rent assistance for its working-class tenants.
</P>
<P>
   The unusual arrangement has made the complex into what city
officials have described as the closest thing to a monopoly in the
city's assisted housing system.
</P>
<P>
   But that is only where questions begin about Kraus, who owns or
manages more than 2,400 other subsidized apartments in the city.
</P>
<P>
   But a brighter light is now being focused on Kraus' businesses.
The United States Department of Housing and Urban Development,
which subsidizes Bedford Gardens, has blocked the latest rent
increase after questions were raised by tenants and tenant
advocates and this month began an audit of Bedford Gardens and
other federally subsidized developments Kraus controls.
</P>
<P>
   Auditors in the New York HUD office wrote recently in an
internal memorandum that they were faced with a crucial question:
Should the federal government use rent subsidies to help a
developer out of a city tax debt, especially when questions persist
about whether that debt mounted so the developer could enrich his
own companies?
</P>
<P>
   In interviews in his spartan offices in Queens County, Kraus
said that he hired his own companies because they did a better job
than any others he had used, and that that was why they cost more _
some services are two to three times more expensive than those used
by comparable developments. Kraus said that city and federal
officials would not acknowledge what it really cost to maintain
subsidized housing.
</P>
<P>
   But displaying a confidence that acquaintances say is
characteristic, Kraus dismissed the planned federal audit as a
charade and expressed more weariness than anxiety about its
outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``Government, in my opinion, has changed from the friendly
government I knew 25 years ago,'' he said. ``I grew up thinking
that Uncle Sam was the greatest partner in the world, with his arm
around you, trying to help. But not anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   In court papers and city records, and in interviews with former
and current city and federal officials, a portrait emerges of an
elaborate, mazelike system for extracting public subsidies from
Bedford Gardens that has frustrated authorities for two decades:
Kraus has often asserted that the complex's bills _ nearly all
charged by his own companies _ are too high. This has helped him
win permission from the city to raise rents, meaning that millions
more in federal dollars flow his way.
</P>
<P>
   When he has not won rent increases, Kraus has simply stopped
paying municipal taxes. He has not paid in almost a decade and now
owes more than $11 million, making him one of the city's biggest
tax scofflaws, even as his service companies have flourished.
</P>
<P>
   Kraus' practices raise larger questions about the laws that
govern subsidized developments like Bedford Gardens, which house as
many as 200,000 city residents. Under those state laws,
self-dealing is allowed as long as the owner informs the
authorities. Kraus says this is why his name is appended boldly to
all his satellite companies.
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman Joseph Lentol, who represents the area and has been
a critic of Kraus' practices, said the laws were meant to permit
flexibility in hiring that could lead to lower expenses. But ``then
you have a guy like Kraus who may be turning it around to make more
money for himself,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Former city officials say Kraus may have escaped more intense
scrutiny because he defies the stereotype of the cagey subsidized
housing operator in one way: He is not a slumlord. His buildings
have been praised as among the cleanest and safest in the city's
assisted housing system, and Kraus says he is proud of that record.
</P>
<P>
   His opponents find darkness even in that virtue, though.
Deteriorated conditions would almost certainly draw action by
authorities, they say. In addition, the city has long suspected,
although never proved, that Kraus' service companies perform
unnecessary work _ like repainting floors instead of cleaning them
or renovating kitchens that need no renovation _ simply to generate
income.
</P>
<P>
   Kraus' maneuverings reached their apex early this year when city
officials, virtually backed into a corner, again allowed him to
raise rents, as part of a deal to help him secure a private loan to
pay off his back taxes and refinance his mortgage.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy has really always been in a class by himself,'' said
a former city housing official who dealt with Kraus and who, like
other former officials, spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   ``In any other kind of business, somebody would have stopped
this kind of thing long ago.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Years before the concrete buildings of Bedford Gardens rose
alongside the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway, Kraus was already a
master at gathering the public housing money rolling into
inner-city neighborhoods in the early 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Using the Municipal Loan Program, which provided low-interest
rehabilitation mortgages, he first rescued some crumbling buildings
on South Second Street in Williamsburg, including the modest tan
brick building where he was raised, No. 359.
</P>
<P>
   In 1976, he became the first developer in the state and one of
the first in the nation to be granted a now widely used Federal
subsidy known as project-based Section 8, to renovate a group of
ravaged buildings in the South Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   Kraus, who had worked his way through Brooklyn Law School
managing battle-scarred buildings in Red Hook and
Bedford-Stuyvesant, threw on overalls and helped repair the
buildings himself, in a neighborhood few other developers would
even visit. ``We sometimes had practice sessions on how to use bomb
blankets,'' he recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next several years, aggressively pursuing money from
local and Federal programs, he bought and rehabilitated dozens of
other buildings in the South Bronx and Williamsburg.
</P>
<P>
   Except for a failed investment in luxury apartments in the early
1990s, Kraus has stuck solely to subsidized housing, and it has
been rewarding. The son of a house painter, he lives in a
multimillion-dollar apartment on Park Avenue. His companies have
been hired recently to manage properties for the New York City
Housing Authority and to work for housing agencies from Long Island
to Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   But even by the time tracts of small family homes were being
cleared to make way for Bedford Gardens in the mid-1970s, Kraus was
already in debt to the city, owing more than $350,000 on mortgages
of $7.9 million. It was the beginning of a pattern of debt that was
to continue for more than two decades.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, in 1973 he was granted the $26 million mortgage for
Bedford Gardens, and he was soon more than $1 million in debt to
the city on that mortgage.
</P>
<P>
   Simultaneously, Kraus had begun building the satellite companies
_ Kraus Maintenance, Kraus Management, Kraus Security System, Kraus
Hi-Tech Security, Kraus Holdings, Kraus Parking, Kraus Vending, and
Kraus Advertising, among others _ that derive almost all their
business from Bedford Gardens or other developments he owns.
</P>
<P>
   In 1976, for example, he incorporated Kraus Security two days
before it began supplying armed guards to Bedford Gardens, at a
monthly cost of $18,400, more than double what the previous company
had charged, according to city auditors.
</P>
<P>
   Kraus contends that he formed his companies out of desperation
because independent contractors he hired always did shoddy work.
(He said one pest-control company even watered down its bug spray.)
``I said, `Wait a minute, if I'm going to take the heat, I might as
well go out and form my own,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent tour of Bedford Gardens, the buildings' common areas
were in sparkling shape _ even the boiler rooms were spotless. When
asked about the complex, tenants, most of whom are Orthodox jews,
generally express a mixture of praise and puzzlement. ``Do you know
how many times they painted the stairs on my floor this month?''
said Thomas King, a bank loan processor who has lived there for 17
years. ``Three times. Instead of cleaning them, they repaint.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Kraus has had extensive debt problems at other
developments and officials have questioned self-dealing throughout
his system, Bedford Gardens has long been the focus of their
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, the Department of Housing Preservation and
Development has repeatedly ordered Kraus to stop using certain of
his companies or to bid out contracts because his rates have been
two or three times what other companies charged. Kraus has either
ignored the orders or conducted bidding in such a way that his
companies were the lowest bidders, according to city records and
former city officials.
</P>
<P>
   While such self-dealing is prohibited or closely watched in many
other industries, it is legal under the state laws that govern
developments like Bedford Gardens, known as Mitchell-Lamas.
</P>
<P>
   The Mitchell-Lama system, created in 1955, gave nonprofit
organizations and private developers like Kraus property tax breaks
and low-interest mortgages to build apartments for middle-class and
working-class tenants. In return, the owners agreed to limit their
profits and keep rents low.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, other Mitchell-Lama owners have begun to exercise a
degree of self-dealing, including using their own management
companies so they can have more control over their buildings. But
Kraus has remained alone in pressing to the outer boundaries of the
law and fighting to remain there.
</P>
<P>
   Through the years, Kraus has also helped his cause by
contributing faithfully to campaigns across the political spectrum
and has always hired the most politically powerful law firm of the
moment to protect his interests.
</P>
<P>
   But he has been aided mostly by the nuances of the law.
</P>
<P>
   One official who now deals with Bedford Gardens said simply that
``there's no affirmative legal prohibition against what he's
doing.''
</P>
<P>
   The city has granted Bedford Gardens four rent increases over
the years, allowing the rents to grow by an average of more than 60
percent. It has long made the complex, whose rents are supposed to
be much lower than those in the open market, among the most
expensive in the Mitchell Lama system. With its latest increase
request delayed for years, rents there now rank somewhere in the
middle. If those increase go through, a two-bedroom apartment at
Bedford that rents for $716 would increase to $889, or 23 percent,
over four years.
</P>
<P>
   Because three quarters of Bedford's tenants receive some rent
help from the federal government, this means that last year, $3.2
million in federal tax dollars went to Bedford Gardens. If Kraus
receives his latest requested rent increase, the federal government
will end up paying an additional $2.5 million over the next four
years.
</P>
<P>
   While the federal inquiry may prove the most serious, it is
hardly the first time Kraus' practices have been questioned, and in
each case he has emerged mostly unscathed.
</P>
<P>
   A 1982 audit by the city Comptrollers' Office charged that over
a four-year period Kraus authorized nearly $2 million in excessive
payments for goods and services, mostly to his own companies.
Kraus' companies, for example, performed simple tasks like
replacing stove knobs that were usually handled by building
superintendents in other developments. The companies charged a
minimum of $1 for every part, even if a washer or other tiny part
cost 10 cents, the audit found.
</P>
<P>
   At a rent increase hearing three years later, city officials
stated in a report that at Bedford Gardens ``the selling Kraus
entity bills the buying Kraus entity for parts on a cost-plus
basis'' _ in other words, a markup, of sometimes 35 percent or 45
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``These conditions enrich Kraus,'' the city's audit concluded,
``because as sole stockholder and president of his related service
companies, he receives salaries, fringe benefits and any net
profits.'' How much the service companies make is difficult to
determine since they are private and not required to disclose their
finances.
</P>
<P>
   A short time later, the city briefly took over the complex
because of concerns about the expenses, but Kraus immediately filed
federal bankruptcy _ which allows the debtor to remain in
possession of his property _ and records show that he apparently
wrested it back within 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   A decade later, a group of Kraus' own partners in Bedford
Gardens unsuccessfully petitioned the city to take over the
development because, they said, Kraus' ``mismanagement,
overcharging and improper self-dealing'' jeopardized its financial
stability.
</P>
<P>
   In court papers, the partners compared Bedford to 17 other
housing projects, and concluded that the annual expenses for repair
and maintenance was often three times as high _ $1,608 per room for
Bedford compared with about $515 for a group of other developments.
</P>
<P>
   The Giuliani administration contends that, despite what Federal
officials now say, it had imposed rigid controls on Kraus before
approving the latest rent increase. For example, it required that
the city oversee the bidding process for several service contracts.
</P>
<P>
   But in their initial review, Federal auditors suggested that the
new rules were not nearly strong enough. ``Missing from the
agreement,'' the auditors said, ``is the requirement that the owner
competitively bid its maintenance and security services'' _
performed by Kraus' companies _ ``which represented almost 90
percent of the project's 1996 operating and maintenance costs.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Roberts, the city's housing commissioner, declined to
comment specifically on why those contracts were left out, except
to say that the city had ``fashioned a solution that, I think,
balanced a lot of competing interests.''
</P>
<P>
   Privately, other city officials still seem content _ so long as
the development remains clean and safe and the city is able to
recoup its mortgage and taxes _ to allow Kraus to continue the
extensive use of his own companies at Bedford Gardens.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can talk about the ethics of doing that,'' the official
said, ``and we can talk about whether there are controls on prices.
But the fact is that his final product is a good product.''

(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 28) 
(af) 
 By MICHAEL M. WEINSTEIN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   An idea that sounded heretical only a year or two ago is
suddenly popping up in all corners.
</P>
<P>
   Privatizing Social Security _ having individuals divert a
portion of their payroll taxes into personal retirement investment
accounts _ is part of the overhaul plans offered by Democratic and
Republican leaders, from moderates like Sen. Daniel Patrick
Moynihan, D-N.Y., to conservatives like Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   It is also at the core of a plan proposed in May by the National
Commission on Retirement Policy, a private group formed by the
Center for Strategic and International Studies and led by Sen. John
Breaux, D-La., and three other members of Congress. The plan has
become a focus of debate over privatization in part because of its
influential bipartisan support and because its detailed provisions
have been scrutinized by government actuaries.
</P>
<P>
   According to its proponents, privatization will help cure Social
Security's financial and philosophical flaws _ among other things,
giving young workers, who have grown disillusioned with the New
Deal program, a shot at earning a fair return on their payroll tax
dollar.
</P>
<P>
   But a growing chorus of economists says the benefits of
privatization are illusory. The critics contend that private
accounts will not help achieve long-term solvency and,
counterintuitive though it seems, that they will not outperform the
sad-sack Social Security trust fund into which payroll taxes now
go.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, on a level playing field, the critics argue, private
accounts as a whole are bound to do worse than the trust fund. And
all this change, they add, poses a needless risk, because Social
Security is only mildly out of fiscal whack.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't difficult to understand why the political ground has
shifted so quickly. Republicans have controlled Congress since
1994, and Social Security, as a gargantuan government program, has
never been the darling of conservatives. Another reason is that the
program is running out of money; in about 20 years, when the baby
boomers begin to retire, the system will be paying out more in
retirement checks than it will be collecting in payroll taxes. So
some kind of fix is needed.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the stock market has been soaring, just when Americans
are becoming accustomed to investing some of their retirement money
in self-directed 401(k) plans. Many, especially younger workers who
don't expect Social Security to survive until their retirement, are
unhappy about seeing their payroll contributions tied up in the
low-yielding trust fund rather than some high-flying stock fund.
</P>
<P>
   And so, like other would-be reformers of Social Security, the
commission set out both to restore the system to solvency and to
create a new political constituency for a national retirement
system. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The so-called crisis confronting Social Security is this: It
would take a reserve of $3 trillion today to pay the difference
between benefits that will be distributed and taxes that will be
collected over the next 75 years. This ominous-sounding number is
cited by those who advocate extensive changes.
</P>
<P>
   But the defenders of the current system say the budget hole is
not formidable, and can be filled by raising payroll taxes by about
two percentage points, to about 14.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Crisis or not, the commission, unwilling to buck the anti-tax
mood in Congress, would achieve long-term balance by cutting
benefits. The cuts could, for example, reduce the first-year
benefits of an individual born in the 1980s by about 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The most striking provision calls for raising the normal
retirement age to 70 by 2029 and the early retirement age to 65 by
2017. Thereafter, the commission calls for these retirement ages to
rise in line with life expectancy. In other words, as medical
breakthroughs allow people to live longer, the commission would
have them spend all of the additional years at work.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Charles W. Stenholm of Texas, a co-chairman of the
retirement commission, says the commission proposes raising
retirement ages in this way to avoid ``imposing higher payroll
taxes or substantially reducing retirement benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics of this proposal, like Peter Diamond, a professor of
economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, call the
proposal ``unrealistic.'' It runs counter to ``a century of trend
toward earlier retirement,'' Diamond said.
</P>
<P>
   Though the commission's initial round of benefit changes would,
by themselves, achieve long-term financial balance for Social
Security, the 24-member panel does not stop there. Instead, it adds
a proposal to partially privatize the retirement system.
</P>
<P>
   Workers would deposit 2 percent of their earnings in private
accounts, choosing among widely diversified stock and bond funds
authorized by the federal government. That would leave 10.4 percent
of earnings in the trust fund.
</P>
<P>
   In part, the idea is to restore younger workers' faith in Social
Security, explained Sen. Judd Gregg, R-N.H., a co-chairman of the
commission. Workers who think of their payroll tax contributions as
an investment often see the Social Security trust fund as a raw
deal: For every $100 that young workers pay into the fund today,
they are likely to get back at retirement 30 years hence only about
$150, an annual rate of return of between 1 and 2 percent after
taking account of inflation. Gregg said private accounts would
``offer much higher rates of return.''
</P>
<P>
   The commission also wants to turn Social Security into a
national savings program, a change from the current approach of
paying today's retirees with today's workers' taxes. The
commission's idea, Gregg explained, is to encourage workers to save
and invest, helping the economy grow richer and making tomorrow's
workers better able to afford the burden of supporting their
parents.
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledges that merely diverting existing taxes into
private accounts does not raise national savings. But the
commission also invites workers to deposit up to $2,000 a year
extra into these tax-advantaged savings vehicles. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The rub is that privatization _ which, remember, is not needed
to ``save'' Social Security _ would worsen the system's financial
balance, at least temporarily, by diverting payroll taxes that
would otherwise be available to pay current retirees.
</P>
<P>
   The commission's solution is to propose a second round of
temporary benefit cuts for retirees who are not poor. It would set
each year's benefits for new retirees at between 98 and 99 percent
of the previous year's figure.
</P>
<P>
   While cuts of less than 2 percent sound small, they add up. By
the 20th year of the program, the benefit of a middle-class family,
now about $1,000 a month, would have fallen about 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the commission, pointing to actuarial projections, says
workers would fare better with privatization because income from
the investments would more than make up for its second round of
benefit cuts.
</P>
<P>
   But critics say privatization won't benefit workers or the
economy very much.
</P>
<P>
   That sounds bizarre: After all, how can a portfolio of stocks
and bonds yielding, say, 5 percent above inflation, not beat the
trust fund's 1 percent return? The critics say the comparison is
misleading.
</P>
<P>
   The trust fund looks bad in part because, unlike private
accounts, under current law it can't invest in stocks. Also,
returns on the trust fund look measly because it bears the burden
of paying off unfinanced claims _ $9 trillion in benefits that the
system has promised to pay but against which it has accumulated no
reserves. The private accounts bear none of this burden.
</P>
<P>
   If it were not for the fact that private accounts would be
allowed to invest in stocks _ and critics have a lot to say about
the misleading nature of that advantage _ they would provide no
financial benefit to workers.
</P>
<P>
   In a forthcoming book on overhauling Social Security, the
economists John Geanakoplos of Yale, Olivia Mitchell of the Wharton
School and Stephen Zeldes of Columbia University point out that,
with or without private accounts, workers must pay for the system's
unfinanced claims _ unless Congress does the unthinkable and breaks
its promise to several generations of retirees.
</P>
<P>
   Either lawmakers will tax the necessary money out of the new
private accounts, reducing their yield, or they will cut future
benefits for today's young workers.
</P>
<P>
   These economists argue that the extra profit that workers earn
on the dollars they deposit into their private accounts is exactly
offset by the extra loss that they suffer on their deposits into
the trust fund _ assuming, still, that the private accounts invest
in the same low-risk securities held by the trust fund. So the
income of retirees would not change, the economists say.
</P>
<P>
   But proponents of privatization counter that most individuals
will invest in stocks and outperform the trust fund. The actuaries'
projections bear them out. Individuals who invest in stocks under
the commission's plan are likely to have slightly more income upon
retirement than they would under the current system once it is
brought into long-run balance.
</P>
<P>
   But critics warn that comparisons among yields on private and
public retirement funds don't take into account that stock
purchases would expose workers to risk that the trust fund does
not.
</P>
<P>
   A fair test would compare private accounts to a trust fund that
would, as many economists propose, invest in corporate stocks and
bonds. By that standard, Diamond, along with Henry J. Aaron, an
economist at the Brookings Institution, contend that the trust fund
would actually outperform private accounts. Private accounts, these
economists say, would be more expensive to administer.
</P>
<P>
   Just think, they say, of the costs of more than 140 million
itsy-bitsy accounts versus one giant government investment fund.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron worries, too, about exposing the retirement income of
individual workers to the risks of investing in the stock market.
He would rather see the Social Security trust fund build reserves _
his preferred way to bolster national savings _ and invest in
corporate stocks and bonds while continuing to pay a set level of
benefits to retirees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why move to a system that produces, after taking account of
administration expenses, lower returns and subjects the elderly to
unwanted risk?'' Aaron asked scornfully. Besides, he added,
privatization plans like the commission's would inevitably widen
the gap between rich and poor because poor workers could be
expected to load their accounts with low-yield bonds while the
wealthier and more knowledgeable focus on stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The critics' arguments veer quickly from arithmetic into
politics, as do those of the proponents of privatization.
</P>
<P>
   Some economists who favor privatization _ notably Professor
Martin Feldstein of Harvard, chairman of the Council of Economic
Advisers in the Reagan administration _ vigorously oppose any plan
that has a government-run retirement fund buy big chunks of
American business. He fears political manipulation of investment
decisions _ for example, by ruling out the purchase of shares in
tobacco companies _ though Aaron and other liberal economists say
government investments could be insulated against that threat.
</P>
<P>
   The Feldstein plan, broadly embraced by Gramm, would make up for
the 2 percent of earnings workers could put in private accounts by
directing $1 trillion in federal surpluses over the next decade
into the Social Security fund.
</P>
<P>
   At retirement, workers would collect a benefit from the trust
fund equal to that of the current law, plus 25 percent of the money
that has accumulated in their individual accounts. The balance of
the private accounts would be turned back to Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone, Feldstein says, would come out ahead, countering
Aaron's worries about exposing the elderly to unwanted financial
risk. Aaron dismisses the plan's rosy outcomes as distorted by its
tapping of temporary government surpluses. The windfall could be
used at least as effectively, Aaron suggests, to build up reserves
in the trust fund.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The political distance between the combatants appears at least
as great as the economic distance.
</P>
<P>
   Gregg embraces private accounts, saying they ``will create a
sense of ownership and control.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, that is the capitalist system,'' he said. ``You take
a personal interest in what you personally own.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., calls the existing program
``the most successful federal program ever enacted'' and says
privatization would ``risk turning Social Security into social
insecurity.''
</P>
<P>
   Economists are no more reconcilable. Aaron says tough-minded
safeguards would allow government to buy perhaps 15 percent of the
equity on Wall Street, free of political influences. Feldstein
refuses to seriously entertain the notion, no matter what
safeguards Aaron concocts.
</P>
<P>
   So what starts out as a fight over actuary tables becomes a
battle over the role of government. The numbers will no doubt be
easier to resolve.

   WASHINGTON WATCH VOTE CHART Questions regarding this
transmission should be directed to 202-628-3100, ext. 216.
WASHINGTON, June 26 -- The following chart shows how senators and
house representatives voted on key bills and amendments in the last
week. A ``Y'' means the member voted for the measure; an ``N''
means the member voted against the measure; a ``?'' means the
member did not vote; and a ``P'' means the member voted
``present.''
</P>
<P>
   SENATE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: EDUCATION
</P>
<P>
   The Senate approved Wednesday, 59-36, legislation that would
allow tax-free education savings accounts for parents or
scholarship sponsors that could be used to defray school costs.
Supporters of the bill said it will lower education costs.
Opponents said that the bill will subsidize private school
education, help mostly the affluent and lead to public school
neglect. A ``yes'' vote favors the bill.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: MILITARY
</P>
<P>
   The Senate voted Thursday, 48-45, to pass an amendment to the
defense budget which would make it harder to shut down more
military bases. Supporters of the amendment said they want to
insure that Congress receives all the information it needs before
deciding to close bases. Opponents said the amendment sends the
message that protecting unnecessary bases and civilian jobs takes
precedence over military preparedness and personnel. A ``yes'' vote
favors the amendment.
</P>
<P>
   3) BILL NUMBER: DEFENSE
</P>
<P>
   The Senate approved, 88-4, the Pentagon's $270 billion budget
for fiscal year 1999. Supporters expressed satisfaction with what
the bill did for their individual states and for the nation as a
whole. Opponents voted against it for individual reasons. A ``yes''
vote favors the budget.

   HOUSE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: FINANCE
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, June 19, the House rejected, 155-254, an amendment to
a campaign finance bill. The measure would have wiped out the
entire reform bill if any of its provisions were declared
unconstitutional. Supporters said that if any part of the bill was
found unconstitutional, it would change the bill's character.
Opponents said the amendment would enable members not in favor of
campaign reform to add unconstitutional provisions for the sole
purpose of killing the bill. A ``yes'' vote favors the bill.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: ABORTION
</P>
<P>
   The House approved Wednesday, 223-254, an amendment to the
annual agricultural spending bill that would prohibit research
funding for the abortion-inducing pill, RU-486. Supporters of the
measure said that supporting research of life-taking substances was
unethical. Opponents said that the amendment infringed upon the
privacy of the patient to choose her treatment. A ``yes'' vote
favors the amendment.
</P>
<P>
   3) BILL NUMBER: IRSREFORM
</P>
<P>
   The House voted Thursday, 402-8, to pass an IRS overhaul and tax
bill. The measure would establish a citizens' oversight board and
increase taxpayer rights in collection disputes with the IRS.
Supporters said the bill would protect taxpayers from any abuse
from the tax agency. Opponents objected to changing the capital
gains holding period from 18 months to 12 months, calling it a tax
break for the wealthy. A ``yes'' vote favors the bill.

 &HT;    Supreme Court rules city officials are liable for managers'
sexual harassment
 &HT;    By Eliot Kleinberg and Larry Lipman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOCA RATON _ City officials are responsible for sexual
harassment by supervisors even if they didn't know about it, the
U.S. Supreme Court ruled Friday in a case that will affect
employers nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling also means the city must pay legal fees for the two
former lifeguards whose complaint took them from their cramped
oceanfront headquarters to the high court. The tab could be as much
as $500,000, their lawyer says.
</P>
<P>
   In the 33-page opinion written by Justice David Souter, the
court upheld a federal judge's 1994 ruling ordering the city to pay
$1 in damages, plus legal fees, to former lifeguards Beth Ann
Faragher and Nancy Ewanchew.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any civilized society would be doing exactly what these
justices did with this ruling,'' Ewanchew said Friday from the
living room of her Boca Raton home. Faragher did not return several
calls.
</P>
<P>
   The Boca Raton decision was one of two 7-2 opinions _ Justices
Clarence Thomas and Antonin Scalia dissented in both _ on employer
liability for harassment by managers. The other involved an
Illinois woman whose supervisor's boss made sexually harassing
comments and threatened her job.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas argued that ``absent an adverse employment consequence,
an employer cannot be held ... liable if a supervisor creates a
hostile work environment.''
</P>
<P>
   But the majority found that employers are liable for the actions
of a supervisor, saying that employers can be released from
liability depending on the reasonableness of anti-harassment
efforts and how the victim tried to avoid harassment.
</P>
<P>
   The justices found Boca Raton officials failed to distribute a
1990 city policy to beach employees, keep track of supervisors'
conduct, or exercise ``reasonable care to prevent the supervisors'
harassing conduct,'' Souter wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The court allowed employers a defense when they properly issue
guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything the court suggests an employer should be doing,
Boca Raton has been doing since 1991,'' said Harry Rissetto, the
city's lawyer in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``From an employer's perspective it could have been worse,''
said Ann Reesman, general counsel for the Equal Employment Advisory
Council, a coalition of 300 large private employers. ``It supports
the employer who makes proactive efforts to fight sexual
harassment. We're just disappointed that they didn't extend that
defense to all cases.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Amlong, the lifeguards' attorney, called Friday's ruling
``the most important employment law decision of the century because
it will reshape the American workplace. No longer can employers
simply play `Hear no evil, see no evil.' ''
</P>
<P>
   A hearing will decide total legal fees, but Amlong said they
would be close to $500,000.
</P>
<P>
   The city will pay from a liability fund, City Manager Donna
Dreska said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The city is financially sound,'' Dreska said, ``(but) this
will obviously be an expenditure we had not planned upon.''
</P>
<P>
   Faragher and Ewanchew sued in 1992, charging supervisors Bill
Terry and David Silverman improperly touched them and made vulgar
comments. The two were later hit with large judgments and the city
with the $1 ruling, leading to the parade of appeals.
</P>
<P>
   ``They spent thousands of dollars to fight this but they should
have cut their losses,'' said Sheila Jaffe of Boca Raton, acting
president of the Florida chapter for the National Organization for
Women. ``They thought they were right. But they weren't.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the NOW's South Palm Beach County chapter that another
supervisor, Robert ``Flash'' Gordon, contacted after the female
lifeguards told him of their abuse. In court, Gordon said he didn't
contact his superior, because that would have been Terry.
Silverman, Terry and Gordon could not be located Friday for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Souter wrote Friday that the two supervisors ``were granted
virtually unchecked authority over their subordinates'' and that
Faragher and her fellow female lifeguards were ``completely
isolated from the city's higher management.''
</P>
<P>
   The court ``ruled that an employer can't escape its
responsibility by hiding its head in the sand and ignoring sexual
harassment in the workplace,'' said Deborah Brake, senior counsel
for the National Women's Law Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a substantial change in sexual harassment law,'' said
Richard Seymour, director of the employment discrimination project
for the Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights Under the Law.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decision streamlines and simplifies sexual harassment law
and makes it far easier ... for a plaintiff to succeed,'' Seymour
said.
</P>
<P>
   A ruling for the city ``would have created an enormous loophole
in the sexual harassment laws for future cases,'' said Jonathan
Turley, a Georgetown University constitutional law professor who
had predicted the court would rule against the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Supreme Court clearly did not want to make ignorance of
conditions a defense when the employer failed to take efforts to
monitor those conditions,'' Turley said.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth du Fresne, a Miami attorney specializing in management
law and labor who represents and trains employers, said holding
employers responsible _ even for harassment they don't know about _
will lead to frivolous suits.
</P>
<P>
   But, she said, the ruling helps employers who establish policies
for preventing and reporting harassment: ``I've been telling them
they should do it and now the courts are telling them they should
do it.''

 &HT;    Atlanta environmentalist commits suicide
 &HT;    By Kathy Scruggs
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- The death of a prominent Atlanta environmentalist who
police say jumped from the 17th floor of a downtown hotel Thursday
night was officially ruled a suicide Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Carolyn Boyd Hatcher, 62, president and CEO of the Georgia
Conservancy and a former Atlanta Parks Commissioner, died of
injuries to her head and chest received during her fall inside the
atrium of the Hyatt Regency Atlanta at 265 Peachtree St. N.E.,
officials with the Fulton County Medical Examiner's office said.
</P>
<P>
   Hatcher gained recognition for her leadership of the Georgia
Conservancy, regarded as the state's premier environmental
organization. As commissioner of Atlanta's Parks, Recreation &AMP;
Cultural Affairs in the early 1980s, she was largely credited as
the person who made Zoo Atlanta one of the best zoos in the country
after it had been ranked as one of the worst. She also was a
founder of Trees Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta police were called to the hotel at 8:40 p.m. Thursday. A
hotel employee told police that while checking for leaking pipes on
the 16th floor on the opposite side of the hotel, he saw a woman in
a planter near the edge of the balcony. He then watched helplessly
as she jumped, the police report said.
</P>
<P>
   Hatcher's purse, found near the hotel elevators, contained two
notes, one listing an emergency contact and another note directing
police to Hatcher's car in a nearby parking garage where her
identification could be found in the trunk, according to the
report.
</P>
<P>
   Family members said she had recently been taking medication for
depression.

 &HT;    Police crime statistics dispute roiling ranks
 &HT;    By Lyda Longa
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Once again the Atlanta Police Department has been
ruptured by a controversy that appears to be depleting morale and
polarizing the force.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a slap in the face,'' said Atlanta robbery Detective
Ed Christian, a 25-year veteran with the department. ``It's
frustrating because most of us work hard and we've done good work.
And those things should come out, too. People shouldn't tear down
the department without cause or proof.''
</P>
<P>
   Christian is talking about a very public dispute between Capt.
Louis Arcangeli and Police Chief Beverly Harvard, as are many of
the rank and file.
</P>
<P>
   Since mid-May, when Arcangeli was demoted from deputy police
chief, the department's top officers have been in a nearly constant
state of public charges and countercharges. Within a few days of
Arcangeli's demotion, a series of memos he wrote to Harvard in 1997
became public. In them, he accused Harvard and two other deputy
chiefs of allowing the department to manipulate crime statistics.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are taking sides on this and it's causing some
separation within the department,'' said Sgt. Archie Ezell. ``I
wouldn't say this is exactly a black eye for us, but I would say it
has cast a shadow over us.'' Ezell, a 12-year veteran who works in
the Zone 2 precinct, said he's spoken to colleagues who are on both
sides of the issue.
</P>
<P>
   After the Arcangeli memos were reported by The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution on May 21, the City Council Public Safety
Committee held a series of public hearings that ended in mid-June.
</P>
<P>
   Some council members clearly believed Arcangeli was unable to
back up his allegations when they asked for specific examples of
how crime reports were changed. The hearings ended with four hours
of angry testimony from Harvard, much of it aimed at Arcangeli, and
focusing on what she called attacks on her integrity. At least one
council member suggested Harvard was responsible for the public
dispute because she declined to call in the GBI to investigate when
Arcangeli requested such a review.
</P>
<P>
   The GBI has since begun an audit of the department's reporting
of crime statistics.
</P>
<P>
   One indication of how much impact this has had on the department
is the degree of public comment from ranking officers. Some believe
Harvard and her deputy chiefs have done nothing wrong; others
believe Arcangeli, who has a good reputation in the department,
would not have raised questions unless he had solid evidence.
Others are angry that Arcangeli made the allegations without having
sufficient proof to convince City Council members.
</P>
<P>
   ``The general view is one of disappointment,'' said Sgt. Lou
Moore, a 25-year veteran who works in the robbery unit. ``This has
certainly not been good for morale because of these allegations.
Doubts have been raised and, really, no answers have been given.''
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta Police Department has a history of such divisive
issues.
</P>
<P>
   In August 1996, several officers _ mostly from Zone 3 in
southwest Atlanta _ were convicted of federal corruption charges
after the FBI and Atlanta police found they had extorted money from
neighborhood drug dealers. Later that year, an officer was accused
of fatally shooting an unarmed customer at a downtown motorcycle
repair shop.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, a promotion cheating scandal rocked the
department.
</P>
<P>
   An investigation ordered by then-Mayor Maynard Jackson concluded
that then-Public Safety Commissioner Reginald Eaves not only knew
about the cheating, but authorized it. The scandal led to the
firing or demotion of several officers and the eventual resignation
of Eaves.
</P>
<P>
   Promotions on the force were stalled until six years later when
another test was given.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta City Councilman Lee Morris said such incidents are
unfortunate but they should not mold the public's opinion of
police.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public should not view rank and file officers differently
because of this,'' Morris said, referring to the latest brouhaha.
``They have nothing to do with this. To me, this is nothing more
than politics. But I agree it probably has had an impact on morale
within the police department. The officers themselves must be
shaken because of all this infighting among their supervisors.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue should be resolved so that officers can move on, said
one veteran police lieutenant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this has reflected badly on everyone in the blue suit,
because our main concern is to save lives and solve problems,''
said Lt. Tony Biello, a 19-year veteran and commander of the
homicide unit. ``But if there's a problem here, let's solve it and
move on.''
</P>
<P>
   M.K. Clayton, a 25-year-old, five-year police veteran who
patrols downtown streets on a bicycle, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know who's right or wrong here; there's always
conflicting stories,'' Clayton said. ``But I think there are far
more important things affecting this department such as low pay and
low morale. As far as my colleagues go, these are the things we're
mostly affected by.''

<P>
   To learn more about the state of relations between the United
States and China, look at a few of the things that are not
happening during President Clinton's nine-day trip to China.
</P>
<P>
   Though he has an official delegation of 1,000 people, not one
represents an American company. Some U.S. companies will sign
contracts during the visit, but Clinton does not plan to attend
that ceremony. The president considered stopping by a new General
Motors Corp. auto factory in Shanghai, but decided against it.
</P>
<P>
   None of that means business has fallen off the U.S.-China
agenda. In fact, Clinton may be downplaying commercial links
precisely because they have become such a dominant bilateral issue:
The political scandal made up of China's business ambitions,
high-tech exports and campaign contributions has dogged him at
home.
</P>
<P>
   More broadly, the fact that the president's trip focuses on
diplomatic strategy, culture and tourism instead of commerce is a
sign that business ties have in some ways outgrown the
contract-by-contract nurturing required during the 1980s or the
early 1990s, when many visiting American dignitaries traveled with
planes full of chief executives seeking high-level contacts.
</P>
<P>
   ``China is not exactly virgin territory for American business,''
said Robert Kapp, president of the U.S.-China Business Council.
``They are there in force. It is not as though they need the
president to let them in on the best kept secret in world trade.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the mid-1980s, when the Occidental Petroleum Corp., the
former American Motors and a handful of other pioneers first
planted stakes in China, China investment has gone from adventurous
to ordinary. More than half of the Fortune 500 companies have
operations there, and smaller companies are also active, down to
entrepreneurs whose only business is in China.
</P>
<P>
   In the early part of this decade, many companies set up
factories in China to manufacture goods for export or began
aggressively marketing their products in China, a spree that shows
few signs of letting up despite China's slowing economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, American companies had two-way trade with China
valued at about $75 billion. They have invested a cumulative $20
billion, eight times as much as they had committed when George Bush
visited China in 1989, the last American president to make the
trip. Among Asian countries, only Japan has a bigger business
relationship with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Like the broader relationship, the state of commercial ties has
long been described in absolutes. Chinese government officials are
seen as either friends or foes of business. The Chinese market is
called a salvation for some companies and a sinkhole for others.
</P>
<P>
   But after two decades of investing, hyperbole has given way to
sober assessments of the pluses and minuses of doing business in
what many call the world's most challenging emerging market. SOme
American companies have been runaway successes; others have proven
dismal failures. Most big companies say they are there for the long
term and are prepared to take their lumps along the way.
</P>
<P>
   Eastman Kodak Co. is a good example. The company struggled for
years to distribute its film in China, while many local companies
sell lower-grade products and enjoy government protection. But
earlier this year, Beijing approved Kodak's longstanding request to
buy out three Chinese competitors, to open two factories and to put
its bright yellow boxes on store shelves nationwide. Kodak has
announced plans to invest $1 billion over the next two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took us several years to get the deal we wanted. You have
to have patience and the willingness to stick it out,'' said David
Swift, president of Kodak's China operation. ``But since we got the
license, everything has been superb.''
</P>
<P>
   Kodak claims to sell more film in China than any other company,
domestic or foreign. Moreover, China has become Kodak's No. 3
worldwide market, behind the United States and Germany and ahead of
Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Massive advertising has helped many American brands gain ground
in China. Four out of five Chinese consumers surveyed by the Gallup
Organization knew Coca-Cola, more than recognized any other foreign
brand name. Procter &AMP; Gamble Co.'s Head and Shoulders shampoo and
Chrysler Corp.'s Jeep sport-utility vehicle, made in China by the
American companies, were also in the top five.
</P>
<P>
   Profits have followed, though not as reliably as some investors
might have hoped. Figures are hard to track, as many U.S.
multinationals decline to break out sales and profits by country.
But the evidence suggests that businesses can operate profitably in
China provided they do what they would need to do anywhere else:
Develop good business plans, make products people can afford to buy
and beat the competition.
</P>
<P>
   One survey conducted by A.T. Kearney, a Chicago-based consulting
firm, asked the bosses of 70 multinationals how their ventures in
China were performing. They responded that 2 out of 5 of their
China ventures _ many have more than one _ were operating in the
black.
</P>
<P>
   They said they expected the rest to break even within three
years of their start-ups.
</P>
<P>
   China's Finance Ministry has reported similar results. A survey
completed last year found that 40 percent of foreign businesses
earned profits in 1996. The rest broke even or ran losses. Given
the huge volume of investments in the mid-1990s, which funded tens
of thousands of new ventures along China's eastern coast, some
analysts say they are surprised that so many can operate
profitably.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``I don't think anyone finds it easy,'' said Rich Miskewicz,
Kearney's managing director for greater China. ``But they are
sticking it out and many are reaching profitability within the time
frame they planned, sometimes even faster.''
</P>
<P>
   But for every success story there is at least one bitter memory.
</P>
<P>
   Ameritech Corp., the Chicago-based Baby Bell, sought to get into
the business of providing cellular phone service in China,
investing $20 million in a venture there. But last year the company
pulled out, citing persistent regulatory obstacles.
</P>
<P>
   Caterpillar Inc., the heavy equipment maker, gave up on a
troubled joint venture with a Shanghai company, saying it had badly
overestimated the market in China for diesel engines. It remains
committed to China however, with several other factories there.
</P>
<P>
   Whirlpool Corp. opened four factories in China to make household
appliances in the mid-1990s, but closed two last year. The company
said the local competitors proved tougher than anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   Among other persistent complaints, businesses say China has a
weak legal system that does not enforce contracts reliably.
</P>
<P>
   American companies lose billions of dollars a year there because
Chinese companies make illegal copies of Prozac, Windows 95,
``Titanic,'' and many famous drugs, software, movies and music that
carry American trademarks and copyrights.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, some areas where American companies have shown
themselves to be fierce competitors elsewhere in the world are
effectively off-limits to foreign investors in China. Retail and
distribution, banking and transportation are a few industries where
bans or restrictions make it difficult to invest.
</P>
<P>
   American officials complain that such barriers help China run a
$50 billion trade surplus with the United States, second only to
Japan's, creating political waves in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually all investors in China face some political risk, both
in China and at home, though many have learned to keep their heads
down when tensions rise. Some companies expanded through the
political repression during and after the Tiananmen Square protests
of 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Those that have withdrawn have sometimes regretted it. Levi
Strauss &AMP; Co. closed up shop in 1994, saying Beijing's violations
of human rights made it an unfit place to invest. The company
returned this spring, saying it wanted to ``untie its hands'' and
resume doing business in one of the world's biggest market for
jeans. &QL;

<P>
   LAKEWOOD, N.J. _ They are the boys of endless summers, measuring
lives in golf putts and long winter vacations in Florida and saying
daily prayers of gratitude that they had the wisdom, foresight and
luck to take early retirement.
</P>
<P>
   And they are not reluctant to add a note of thanks to Social
Security for helping to make it all possible.
</P>
<P>
   For those who scoff at early retirement as a fast track to
redundancy, who say that life without work well into one's 60s is,
well, pointless, the men in the clubhouse at Woodlake County Club
here in the piney woods of the Jersey Shore patiently acknowledge
that added years of leisure may not be for everyone. But they can't
hide their delight at having left the rat race before they were too
old to realize their dreams.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually every plan to put Social Security back on a sound
financial footing calls for pushing back the retirement age from 65
and trimming the benefits of early retirees. But that proposition
flies in the face of Americans' conduct over the last three
decades.
</P>
<P>
   The percentage of those choosing to retire before they are
eligible for full Social Security benefits has more than doubled,
to 71.1 percent of those receiving benefits in 1996, from 31.7
percent in 1965.
</P>
<P>
   The Woodlake golfers represent the trend. So do many people
interviewed recently in other towns in Ocean and Monmouth counties,
which have some of the highest concentrations of retirees outside
Florida and Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   To this sampling of people who have retired early _ or are about
to do so _ the idea of of giving up the daily grind has enormous
appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I marvel at people driven by the need to make money and have
few other interests in life,'' reflected Joe Albowicz, 59, a former
mortgage banker who essentially retired four years ago when his
company was acquired by another and he was let go.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being without a job and an office gave me a chance to ask
myself, `Where am I going? How much money is enough?' '' he said
after completing a round of golf with friends.
</P>
<P>
   Albowicz, who has no pension, said he had accumulated enough
money to live the next quarter-century in comfort just by drawing
on the principal, without benefit of interest or dividends. Though
without a pressing need to draw an early Social Security retirement
benefit at age 62, he nonetheless said he was entitled to it, a
sentiment echoed by others who, for the most part, are more
dependent on the added income.
</P>
<P>
   Job dissatisfaction or burnout was often cited as the motivation
to leave work early for those who could afford to do so. For many,
fattened retirement programs, bolstered by zooming individual stock
investments, helped move up the target date for retirement.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt that explained why the television set in the clubhouse
bar was tuned to CNBC, the financial news network, with stock
prices streaming across the bottom of the screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may be the last generation able to enjoy this quality of
life in our early 60s,'' said Marty Stern, 63, a retired
manufacturer's representative. ``If in the future you can't retire
until you are in your 70s, you are going to be a lot older and a
lot less active. Who wants to sit at a desk all your working life
and then sit around when you retire?''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're still alive and breathing at that age,'' said
another golfer, Ralph Arbia, half-jokingly. At age 59, Arbia has
the sturdy build of a much younger man.
</P>
<P>
   Death, particularly early death, was a specter haunting some men
who opted for early retirement. ``My father was 62 when he retired,
and he dropped dead a while later,'' explained Joe Mento, who
played a round of golf with some friends earlier this month to
celebrate his 63rd birthday, days after returning from a gambling
vacation in Las Vegas, Nev. ``Let's face it: Men die early, so why
hang around in a job if you can afford to have some fun before you
check out?''
</P>
<P>
   Mento sold his Brooklyn company, which rebuilt auto
air-conditioners, and moved to the Jersey Shore to be near his
grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted out; it was just a way of making money, and I hated
it,'' he said with emphasis.
</P>
<P>
   For Luis Alvarez, 56, a construction worker on a road project in
Monmouth County, the issue is enduring the rigors of outdoor work
until he turns 62 and can collect early Social Security benefits.
He said painful arthritis in his hands nearly cripples him on cold
winter days, and speculated that those who wanted to push back the
Social Security retirement age never carried a lunch pail to a job
site on a raw day in January.
</P>
<P>
   As gingerly as Washington deals with Social Security, it seems
more loath to address the spiraling costs of Medicare. And for many
older workers, medical benefits are as much an issue in retirement
planning as is a pension.
</P>
<P>
   Margaret Lewis, 57, of Manalapan, N.J., is a supervisor in the
state employment services office in Freehold, and plans to retire
at the end of this year, citing job burnout. Her husband, Michael,
58, is a self-employed paperhanger with no pension or medical
benefits of his own.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Lewis has 34 consecutive years of service with the state
and can claim a $30,000 annual pension with full medical coverage
for both her and her husband.
</P>
<P>
   When she turns 62, she expects to start receiving $980 a month
in Social Security payments, which she says gleefully ``will be
like winning the lottery.''
</P>
<P>
   Her words resonate with Bob Matthews, 64, who retired eight
years ago from teaching at a middle school in East Orange. ``I was
burned out dealing with all the problems of an inner-city school,
trying to figure out a way to retire at age 55 and keep myself
going on a pension until I was eligible for reduced Social Security
benefits when I turned 62,'' said Matthews, of Toms River. ``Then I
hit the state lottery jackpot of $1.5 million, which gave me a nice
annuity for 20 years,'' he beamed.
</P>
<P>
   The grin fading, he said that for future generations, hitting
the lottery may be among the few ways of achieving the dream of
early retirement.

BUSH'S DECISION TO SPARE LUCAS ANGERS FAMILY OF DEAD TEEN 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By S.K. BARDWELL 
and PATTY REINERT 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Laura Jean Donez had just started her first year of
high school. She was in the ROTC. She had a boyfriend, and
permission to wear makeup. Life was just beginning for the
16-year-old when it ended, brutally, in April 1983.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Jean has been dead now nearly as long as she lived. The
horror of her death remains fresh for her sisters, and Thursday's
decision by the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles to recommend
sparing the life of her killer, Henry Lee Lucas, left them
devastated.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas, who is serving a life sentence for Donez's murder, was
scheduled to be executed in another case Tuesday. Rosanna Fuentes,
Laura Jean's big sister, had planned to attend. It would have been
the first time that the relative of a victim in a case other than
the one in which the death sentence was given would be allowed to
witness the execution.
</P>
<P>
   By Friday afternoon, Gov. George W. Bush had taken the parole
board's recommendation and stopped the execution, commuting Lucas'
sentence to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very angry. I'm very disappointed in George Bush, and very
disappointed in our court system,'' Fuentes said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm completely convinced that he killed my sister. He took the
... sheriff's deputies where he left her. They made a wrong turn,
and he corrected them. He lay down on the spot where he left her
body, in the position how he left her there.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucas got life for what he did to Donez. The irony of it is not
lost on her sister: Noting she has fought for seven years to see
Lucas die, Fuentes said she wishes she could have used that time
and energy, instead, to fight for Laura Jean to live.
</P>
<P>
   ``Another year, another two years _ the rest of her life,''
Fuentes said. ``She hadn't even started living yet.''
</P>
<P>
   The events of that April 15 years ago are also seared into the
memory of Laura Jean's younger sister, Virginia Donez. Fuentes, who
already had married and left home, said Virginia and Laura Jean
were inseparable.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was my life,'' Virginia said. ``My mother, my father, my
big sister, my everything.'' The two had big plans: It was Laura
Jean's first year in Reagan High School in Houston and Virginia's
last year of middle school.
</P>
<P>
   The girls had often watched the Reagan ROTC drilling after
school, and Virginia said: ``It was a promise we made to each
other, that when we got out of middle school, we would join ROTC
and join the drill team, and we'd be in together when I got there.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that was her first year and her last year, so that, that
plan didn't last too long.''
</P>
<P>
   That Friday was ROTC Day at Reagan, when all the members of the
corps wore their uniforms all day. When Virginia went downstairs in
the family's house that morning, Laura Jean was sitting in the
living room. She had a problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``She didn't have any pantyhose,'' Virginia said, and that was
part of the required uniform for women in the corps. Missing any
part of that uniform resulted in an ``F'' in ROTC for the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``She didn't want to get an F, so she said she wasn't going to
school that day,'' Virginia said. The younger sister told Laura
Jean she'd see her after school.
</P>
<P>
   She never saw her again.
</P>
<P>
   Before an older sister left that afternoon to pick up various
children at their schools, Laura Jean went to a hamburger joint
around the corner from their house.
</P>
<P>
   ``She got her hamburger,'' Virginia said. ``That's what the
coroner said.''
</P>
<P>
   But Laura Jean never made it home.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia was the one who called all Laura Jean's friends when
she got home from school that day and couldn't find her sister. It
was Virginia who called their mother at work; Virginia who argued
with police that her sister did not run away, would not leave
without telling her.
</P>
<P>
   A week went by. On Thursday, Virginia was walking down a school
hallway with a friend and saw Rosanna from the back. ``I yelled,
`Hey, Rosa,' and she turned,'' Virginia said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When she turned around, her face was so red, and so wet,''
Virginia remembered. ``I knew something was wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosanna cried and told her little sister, ``They found her, they
found Laura Jean.''
</P>
<P>
   At home, Virginia said, detectives approached her with a little
cup. They uncovered it, and asked if she could identify the pieces
of jewelry inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew every piece by heart,'' she said. ``I started to cry. I
ran inside and ran into her room and just sat there a long time. No
one had ever told me yet she was dead, but I knew.''
</P>
<P>
   Laura Jean was found in thick woods near the Sam Houston
National Forest in Montgomery County, just north of Houston. She
had been beaten in the head, strangled, sexually abused and set
afire.

TEXAS GOVERNOR COMMUTES A DEATH SENTENCE TO LIFE TERM 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By ALLEN R. MYERSON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush agreed Friday to save the
life of one of the nation's most notorious multiple murderers
rather than see him executed for a killing he may not have
committed.
</P>
<P>
   In commuting the death sentence of Henry Lee Lucas to life in
prison, the first time the governor has done so for a death row
inmate, Bush said Lucas was undoubtedly guilty of other crimes for
which he has already received several life sentences.
</P>
<P>
   But he noted that there was strong evidence that Lucas was in
Florida at the of the crime for which he faced death, the rape and
murder of an unidentified hitchhiker 19 years ago. He said Lucas'
confession, later called into question and recanted, was the only
evidence linking him to the slaying.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a supporter of the death penalty for those who commit
horrible crimes, I feel a special obligation to make sure the state
of Texas never executes a person for a crime they may not have
committed,'' Bush said in a statement. ``I take this action so that
all Texans can continue to trust the integrity and fairness of our
criminal justice system.''
</P>
<P>
   For many politicians, showing mercy to a killer could be risky.
But Bush, a leading, but unannounced contender for the Republican
presidential nomination, has balanced a reputation for conservative
firmness with a greater sense of moderation than some of his
Republican rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Rescuing Lucas is an especially delicate matter in Texas, which
leads the nation by far in executions, with many citizens clamoring
for more.
</P>
<P>
   In his decision, Bush accepted the recommendation Thursday of
the state Board of Pardons and Paroles, whose members he appointed.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas, 61, was scheduled to be executed by lethal injection at
6:01 p.m. Tuesday. He is already serving six life terms, two
75-year terms and one 60-year term for nine other killings.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, Lucas claimed to have committed as many as 600
murders in more than 20 states around the nation. But he later
admitted that most of these confessions were hoaxes, a revelation
that compounded his notoriety.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Jim Mattox, a former attorney general who also supports the
death penalty, reviewed the case and concluded that work records,
statements from neighbors and other evidence offered compelling
evidence that Lucas was in Florida at the time of the crime.
</P>
<P>
   Bush refused four months ago to spare Karla Faye Trucker, a
convicted pickax killer, despite the pleas of conservative
Christians that her life be spared because she had gone through a
Christian conversion and shown remorse.
</P>
<P>
   In comparison, Lucas seemed like an unlikely candidate for
clemency. He has been downright boastful of crimes including the
1960 slaying of his 74-year-old mother. His prosecutors have said
that they still consider him guilty of the ``Orange Socks'' murder,
the state's current attorney general has said he wouldn't question
a jury's decision, and state and federal courts have consistently
ruled that he received a proper trial.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who was attending a meeting with Mexican governors in
Brownsville, on the border, took pains to distinguish the Lucas
case from others.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am reluctant to second guess a verdict of a jury and the
courts, he said. ``However, the clemency process is intended as a
fail safe for unusual or exceptional circumstances. In this case,
at the time it made its decision, the jury did not know and could
not have known that Henry Lee Lucas had a pattern of lying and
confessing to crimes that evidence later proved he did not
commit.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor's aides said he had left for a vacation and would
be not be available for any further comments. &QL;

EXTREMISTS NOT WELCOME WHERE HATE CRIME OCCURRED 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By RICK BRAGG    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JASPER, Texas _ Terrya Mitchell, who is black, is taking her
16-year-old daughter to Houston early Saturday morning, to go
skating. Steve Seale, who is white, is leaving town before dawn, to
go fishing.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, many people in this little East Texas town say that
they will not be here by Saturday afternoon, that they will not
take part then, even as spectators, as the Ku Klux Klan, the New
Black Panthers and the Black Muslims use Jasper's recent tragedy as
a platform of their own at a Klan assembly. The town, most here
say, simply does not need the divisiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be fishing in Sabine Lake,'' said Seale, a lawyer who was
born and and raised here.
</P>
<P>
   Jasper, a racially mixed town of 8,000 people, has drawn praise
around the country for keeping calm in the three weeks since a
49-year-old disabled black man, James Byrd Jr., was chained by his
ankles to the rear bumper of a pickup truck and dragged to his
death, in what prosecutors are calling a hate crime.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of living in simmering bitterness, instead of erupting
in racial conflict, blacks and whites have joined in prayer vigils,
rallies and sometimes just one-on-one discussions over
chicken-fried steak, all intended to bind up the wounds caused by
that crime and to show the outside world that what happened here
hurt and outraged all the town's people, not just its blacks.
</P>
<P>
   But the gruesome nature of Byrd's death _ some parts of his
dismembered body were found miles from others _ has drawn worldwide
media attention, and that focus has in turn drawn extremists who,
people here say, want to capitalize selfishly, no matter how much
their doing so hurts Jasper.
</P>
<P>
   The Klan initially said it was coming here only to disavow any
connection to the three murder suspects, two of whom are said to
have Klan affiliations from their days in prison together, but
leaders of the KKK now concede that they will also talk about
``white pride'' and use the press attention to explain their
platform.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the outside coming in and disrupting a community that has
been dealing very conscientiously with this situation,'' said
Walter Diggles, director of the Deep East Texas Council of
government, a Jasper planning organization formed to help local
governments. Diggles, who is black, plans to stay away.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a distraction,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It will be almost a blessing, residents say, if that is all it
turns out to be.
</P>
<P>
   The Klan assembly is set for the courthouse square between noon
and 2 p.m., and the New Black Panthers of Dallas plan to attend. So
does a group of Black Muslims, mostly from Houston, that has
already marched here once, armed with rifles and shotguns.
Residents fear a confrontation in which bystanders might be hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not from here, and have no relatives here,'' said Ms.
Mitchell, an office worker at the Mount Olive Baptist Church.
Neither side has any stake in the community and yet both feel free
to use it as their battleground, she said, adding, ``It's a bad
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton and Gov. George W. Bush have asked the groups
not to assemble here, to let the town alone, but have been ignored.
So more than 200 federal, state, county and city law-enforcements
officers are to be on hand to try to keep the peace.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   It is still unclear how many people will attend, but at least 20
Klansmen and an equal number, or more, from the two black groups
are expected.
</P>
<P>
   No one in the Klan assembly _ made up of klaverns from Vidor and
Waco, along with some members from Georgia _ will be armed, its
leaders say. But some individual Klansmen are making no such
promise.
</P>
<P>
   And on Thursday the Panthers issued a statement urging black
residents of Jasper to ``load your guns, stand on your porches''
and protect themselves and their homes. It is legal in Texas to
carry a loaded weapon, even at an assembly such as the Klan is
planning.
</P>
<P>
   Of the crime from which Saturday's gathering sprang, Michael
Lowe, a leader from the Waco klavern, said, ``A lot of blame has
been put on Klansmen.''
</P>
<P>
   Three men _ John William King and Shawn Allen Berry, both 23 and
both of Jasper, and another East Texan, Lawrence Russell Brewer, 31
_ are charged with the killing. As prison inmates several years
ago, Brewer and King joined the Confederate Knights of America, a
loosely defined prison gang for white supremacists that has ties to
the Klan. King was disciplined in prison in 1995 for a racial
disturbance between white and Hispanic inmates.
</P>
<P>
   But Lowe said neither Brewer nor King were Klansmen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not know a Klansman,'' he said, ``who would condone such
a murder.''
</P>
<P>
   While gruesome killings may be every bit as much a part of the
Klan's identity as is racial hatred, Lowe said that was the old
Klan. His Klan, the one assembling in Jasper, is a Klan with a
national platform.
</P>
<P>
   ``'We believe that all immigration should be stopped in America
for 10 years,'' he said, ``until there are enough jobs to support
our working force in America. We do not believe in spending
billions of dollars overseas to nations who do not care for us in
the first place. We could be spending it on our inner cities. We do
not believe that anyone should just be allowed to move plants'' out
of the country. Overseas expansion is fine, but ``they should not
be allowed to just shut their doors here, putting Americans out of
a job.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Klan is not just racial,'' he went on, although whites in
Jasper have been smeared by the crime, and the Klan rally is also
in support of them.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Potok, who tracks Klan activity at the Southern Poverty Law
Center, called the Klan's presence in Jasper ``completely
opportunistic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Their assertion that they are coming to instill white pride in
Jasper is a ludicrous concept,'' Potok said. ``This is not a crime
that can be blamed on the white community in Jasper. Why would they
need white pride?''
</P>
<P>
   As the town steels itself for Saturday's assembly, Jasper County
officials have cleared the way for prosecutors to seek executions
in the case. The officials said this week that they would try to
obtain a capital murder indictment of at least two of the three
suspects _ presumably Brewer and King, although the officials would
not say _ when a grand jury is impaneled here on July 6. To convict
for capital murder, the prosecutors must prove that the killing
occurred in tandem with another serious crime, like kidnapping.
</P>
<P>
   While prosecutors have declined to speak publicly about a
possible deal for testimony, only one of the accused, Berry, has so
far cooperated with investigators. &QL;

SERBS READY FOR LARGE-SCALE ATTACKS ON KOSOVO REBELS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to sharpen lede and trim extraneous sentence from 12th

<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Serbia _ Serbian forces, planes and heavy weapons are
massing for large-scale attacks to recapture pockets of Kosovo held
by ethnic Albanian rebels and to reopen roads the separatists have
blocked for weeks, Western diplomats and military officials said on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The escalation of the fight against the rebels came as Richard
Holbrooke, the U.S. special envoy, left Pristina empty-handed after
four days of shuttle talks with the Yugoslav president, Slobodan
Milosevic, and ethnic Albanian leaders. ``We all agree that we are
at a dangerous moment and our goal remains to prevent the fighting
that's already going on from escalating to a general war,''
Holbrooke said.
</P>
<P>
   There appeared to be little left that western diplomats could do
to prevent the assault, given the intransigence of the insurgents
and determination of Milosevic to retake the main arteries in the
province.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats said they feared the attacks, which could begin within
hours or days, might lead to further fighting beyond the borders of
the province and could usher in a low-intensity war that could last
for years.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke had hoped to secure an agreement from the Kosovo
Liberation Army rebels to take down barricades along main routes in
the province. He had planned to use the reopening of the roads as
leverage to get Milosevic to call off an attack against the
insurgents by the 50,000 special police and troops deployed in
Kosovo. But the rebels, who say they will fight until they have
achieved their goal of an independent state, rebuffed Holbrooke.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels' lack of a central command made it difficult for
Holbrooke to be sure his message had reached the top rebel
authorities. He asked Adem Demaci, a militant political leader who
openly supports the rebel movement, to pass on a message for him,
but Demaci was unsure whom to contact, western diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
   On his visit here, Holbrooke, reiterating demands made by the
United States and its allies, called for a resumption of talks
between Belgrade and the pacifist ethnic Albanian leader, Ibrahim
Rugova, that were broken off by the ethnic Albanians because of the
fighting. He also called for all checkpoints to be removed, for
Serbian special units to be withdrawn and for the approximately
100,000 ethnic Albanians driven from their homes in the attacks to
be allowed to return to their villages.
</P>
<P>
   Washington has called on Belgrade to grant the ethnic Albanians
the autonomous status it revoked eight years ago but does not
support the drive by the insurgents to create an independent state.
</P>
<P>
   There were numerous indications on Friday that an attack was
imminent.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav MiG-21 fighter planes roared in pairs down the runway
of the Pristina airport. The military, which has been warned that
NATO is prepared to take punitive measures including air strikes,
has set up 30mm anti-aircraft guns and SA-9 Gaskin surface-to-air
missiles around the airport and on hilltops. There has been a
concentration of tanks, armored personnel carriers, and heavy
artillery on the edge of the rebel-held pockets and large-scale
movement of troops outside of the provincial capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``The signs are there of a pending attack,'' said a senior
western military official. ``It will take the Serbs a few hours to
roll into these areas and smash through the roadblocks. The rebels
don't stand a chance. But this attack will trigger a wider,
deadlier war, bringing the conflict to the cities, creating small,
mobile bands of armed men that could see fighting here last for
years. The Serbs will make some short term gains, but this assault
could mean they have lost Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   Several hundred people have been killed since February when the
police launched the first Serbian attack aimed at wiping out the
rebel movement.
</P>
<P>
   Belgrade, which is spending an estimated $2 million a day to
keep its forces deployed in Kosovo, apparently believes that
another strike against the rebels, who have taken control of as
much as 40 percent of the province since March, will be the final
blow. This will be the third, and largest, counter-insurgency drive
against the rebels since the attacks began in March. Each drive has
only exacerbated the violence and pushed the province, where ethnic
Albanians outnumber Serbs nine to one, into a wider rebellion
against Serbian rule.
</P>
<P>
   There is daily skirmishing and tons of weapons and ammunition,
along with hundreds of ethnic Albanian fighters, have crossed the
border from northern Albania into Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke warned on Friday that the siege by the ethnic Albanian
rebels around Kijevo, a Serbian town cut off for over a month from
by the rebels, would not be tolerated much longer by Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   The outpost, on the main east-west road between Pristina and the
western, Serbian-dominated town of Pec, is under daily attack and
food is scarce. He called the village ``the most dangerous place in
Europe'' because a battle to liberate the town by the Serbs could
trigger a wider war.
</P>
<P>
   He warned that in their talks Milosevic had repeatedly asserted
``the right to keep the roads in his country open.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm leaving this region today with no magic bullets for
peace,'' Holbrooke said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   After Holbrooke's departure on Friday, Ambassador Richard Miles,
the U.S. chief of mission in Yugoslavia, and Christopher Hill, the
U.S. ambassador to Macedonia, made an attempt to prevent a Serbian
attack. They drove out to the rebel barricade at Lapushnik where
trashed cars and cement blocks have been set up for the last seven
weeks on the road from Pristina to Pec.
</P>
<P>
   The diplomats sat on a grassy slope under European oaks and
waited half an hour for the arrival of a local rebel commander. A
motley collection of rebels carrying AK-47 assault rifles and
rocket propelled grenades eyed the diplomats nervously until the
commander, wearing fatigues and a beret and carrying a
walkie-talkie, arrived.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are against all blockage of roads,'' Hill told the
commander. ``We need time. We are deeply concerned and deeply
engaged in finding a peaceful solution, but a peaceful solution is
the only solution.''
</P>
<P>
   The rebel commander promised to deliver the message to his
superiors. The diplomats traveled silently back to Pristina in two
white armored vehicles along the deserted road, covered with spent
shell casings.

BUSH COMMUTES LUCAS' DEATH SENTENCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN MORITZ 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush followed his parole board's
advice Friday and halted Tuesday's planned execution of Henry Lee
Lucas, saying that too many doubts persist about the confessed
killer's guilt in the case that sent him to Death Row.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take every death penalty case seriously and review each case
carefully,'' Bush said in a written statement. ``The first question
I ask in every case is whether there is any doubt about the
individual's guilt or innocence.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first case since I have been the governor when the
answer to that question is `Yes.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Lucas, 61, once confessed to 600 killings. He was scheduled to
die in Huntsville for the Halloween 1979 rape and strangulation of
a still-unidentified woman whose almost-nude body was found near
Interstate 35 in Williamson County.
</P>
<P>
   But, as in many of the slayings Lucas admitted to, evidence
later emerged suggesting that the drifter was nowhere near when the
crime was committed.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's decision means that the oldest inmate on Huntsville's
Death Row will soon be transferred to the prison system's
diagnostic center, where he will undergo psychological evaluation
and other tests before being permanently reassigned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can only thank them for believing the truth and having the
guts to stand up for what's right,'' Lucas said in a statement
released by prison officials.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's decision does not give Lucas hope for regaining his
freedom. He is serving six other life sentences, and 210 years in
prison for nine other murders.
</P>
<P>
   A murder charge pending in Florida could earn him the death
penalty if he were to obtain parole or a pardon in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, a staunch defender of the death penalty, has not
intervened in the imminent execution of inmate since taking office
3 1/2 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In February, he declined to stop the execution of Karla Faye
Tucker, who professed a conversion to Christianity and publicly
expressed remorse for her part in using a pickax to hack to death a
couple in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous religious leaders, including Pope John Paul II, called
for Tucker to be spared. Bush said he allowed the execution to go
forward because she was undeniably guilty. Tucker, who never
claimed innocence, became the first woman to be executed in Texas
since the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   Bush raised concerns this month about whether Lucas should be
executed after former Attorney General Jim Mattox cited a 1986
investigation by his office, which showed that the condemned man
was probably in Florida when the 1979 Texas murder occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Mattox, a Democrat who is again running for attorney general,
and Bush, a Republican, said Lucas is guilty of other crimes and
should never be released from prison. But carrying out the
execution for a case in which guilt is not absolutely certain would
be abhorrent, both said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush's decision will make our death penalty
punishment stronger than ever,'' said Mattox, who added that police
should reopen cases in which Lucas made confessions. ``But it was
still politically risky, and I'd be glad to stand up and defend him
against attack.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's first rebuke came from fellow Republican John Cornyn, who
is running against Mattox in the attorney general's race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have confidence both in the jury who heard this case and in
the 23 (appellate) judges who reviewed the evidence,'' said Cornyn,
a former Texas Supreme Court Justice. ``I believe their decision
should be respected and their sentence carried out.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Democrat Garry Mauro, Bush's opponent in
November's election, said the governor may see some political
fallout from his actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The initial downside for Bush is whether or not the Christian
Coalition decides to call him a fraud because he wouldn't get
involved with the parole board with Karla Faye Tucker, but he's
following Jim Mattox's lead on Henry Lee Lucas,'' said Joe
Cutbirth, Mauro's spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's decision in the Lucas case, made public 24 hours after
the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles announced its
recommendation, caps one of Texas' most bizarre crime sagas.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas, a drifter who had served time in Michigan for killing his
mother, was arrested in Montague County, Texas, in June 1983 for
being an ex-con with a weapon. While in jail, he confessed to
killing an elderly woman who had disappeared from her home in
Ringgold.
</P>
<P>
   He also told the sheriff that he had killed a 15-year-old girl
who had hitchhiked with him on trips across the South and West.
</P>
<P>
   Other confessions followed, and soon Lucas' tally of death
numbered in the hundreds. Almost all were later proved to have been
hoaxes, but Williamson County officials prosecuted him for the 1979
slaying and secured the death penalty.

ENGLAND BEATS COLOMBIA 2-0
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By ROGER COHEN     
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LENS, France _ A revitalized England, inspired by the return of
midfielder David Beckham, surged to a 2-0 victory Friday over
Colombia and qualified for the second round of the World Cup
tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Colombia, with its aging team revolving around its captain,
Carlos Valderrama, could find little space for its close passing
game and bowed tamely out of the tournament. But for the remarkable
goalkeeping of Farid Mondragon, the defeat would have turned into a
rout.
</P>
<P>
   At 18, England striker Michael Owen is half the age of
Valderrama, and the difference showed. Owen brought new width and
pace to the English attack, constantly unsettling the Colombian
defense. His extraordinary acceleration left defenders gaping.
</P>
<P>
   With Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Paraguay and Mexico in the Round
of 16, Colombia's exit amounted to the one shadow on an impressive
Latin American performance in France.
</P>
<P>
   England, which came in second in Group G behind Romania, will
meet Argentina on Tuesday in what promises to be an explosive
battle. Romania will meet Croatia on the same day.
</P>
<P>
   The England-Colombia game, which ended the first-round matches,
was played in this soccer-loving northern city, where the joyous
expectation of World Cup games has turned into the nightmare of
violence. Helmeted police roamed Friday with tear gas and dogs, and
alcohol was banned in a 30-mile radius of the city. No serious
incidents were reported.
</P>
<P>
   After fielding defensive efforts in his team's opening two
matches _ a 2-0 victory over Tunisia and a 2-1 loss to Romania _
Coach Glenn Hoddle brought in Beckham, England's best passer who
plays for Manchester United.
</P>
<P>
   Beckham and right wing Darren Anderton repeatedly created space
on the right, and England's first goal came in the 20th minute.
Beckham crossed, the ball was headed out and Anderton blasted an
unstoppable shot into the top right-hand corner of the net.
</P>
<P>
   Nine minutes later, Beckham helped sting Colombia again. After
English midfielder Paul Ince was brought down about 25 yards out,
Beckham stepped up and curled a free kick over the Colombian wall
and just inside the post. Mondragon's flailing dive, as he scurried
to the right, could not stop the goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was simply a superb free kick,'' Hoddle said afterward.
</P>
<P>
   With Colombia seldom threatening, except for briefly at the
start of the second half, England held on to its lead and could
have increased it. Owen, the third youngest player to play in a
World Cup, after Norman Whiteside of Northern Ireland and Brazil's
Pele, almost scored in the 60th minute when he raced past the
Colombian defense. But his shot was blocked by Mondragon.
</P>
<P>
   The striker, who was signed by Liverpool at age 11 and this year
became the youngest player to score for England, was irrepressible,
popping up on the left and right and creating spaces for England
Captain Alan Shearer, who twice went close with shots that were
saved.
</P>
<P>
   ``England closed down the spaces; they were simply better,''
said Hernan Dario Gomez, the Colombian coach.
</P>
<P>
   Passions should run high in England's game against Argentina
next week. The teams last met in the World Cup in 1986, four years
after the countries went to war over the Falkland Islands.
Argentina won, 2-1, in the quarterfinal match, thanks to two goals
by Maradona. &QL;

ODYSSEY BEGINS ITS EPIC JOURNEY 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A 20-story high converted North Sea drilling platform called the
Odyssey has set out on an epic journey worthy of its name.
</P>
<P>
   The self-propelled platform is the centerpiece of a
multinational effort led by The Boeing Co. to do something never
attempted before _ launch large communication satellites into orbit
from the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   It left a Russian shipyard June 20 for Long Beach, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   If the 70- to 80-day trip goes as planned, the Odyssey will
berth near the end of August at its future homeport about a mile
from the Queen Mary, the ocean liner turned tourist attraction.
</P>
<P>
   The public can track Odyssey's journey to Long Beach on the
Internet at
www.boeing.com/defense-space/space/sealaunch/platformroute.html.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Odyssey, some 436 feet long and 220 feet wide, is
too big to pass through the Panama Canal, it was to have made the
trip to Long Beach around Cape Horn at the tip of South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   But project officials decided in recent days to send the Odyssey
through the Suez Canal, which is wider than the Panama Canal.
Odyssey will then cruise along on pontoons bigger than a Trident
submarine at a speedy 13 knots as it crosses the Red Sea and Indian
Ocean to Singapore, where it will have a straight shot to Long
Beach across the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   The new route avoids Cape Horn, which boasts some of the most
ferocious seas in the world, especially at this time of year. It is
now winter south of the Equator.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were concerned about significant weather delays, and even
the possibility that a winter storm could damage the Odyssey,''
said Tim Hansen, Boeing project director for Sea Launch in Seattle,
of the route change.
</P>
<P>
   Had a severe storm come up during the trip around Cape Horn, the
plan was to have the Odyssey lay off the Faukland Islands until the
weather improved, Hansen said.
</P>
<P>
   The new route will take about 10 days longer than had Odyssey
gone around Cape Horn in ideal conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although we are adding a few days, we are lessening the
risk,'' Hansen said.
</P>
<P>
   The project is already several months behind schedule and it is
important to get the Odyssey to Long Beach as soon as possible so
it can be readied for its historic first rocket mission, now
scheduled for October.
</P>
<P>
   That debut ocean launch from Odyssey of a Ukrainian-built Zenit
rocket carrying a U.S. satellite will mark not only a space-age
first, but an important new chapter for Boeing as it further
establishes itself as a major player in the booming and lucrative
launch vehicle business.
</P>
<P>
   Since last year, Odyssey has been at the Vyborg shipyard near
St. Petersburg, Russia, being outfitted with a rocket transporter
erector, rocket fueling equipment and other systems necessary to
turn the former oil-drilling rig into a floating launch complex.
</P>
<P>
   That work was to have been completed in January, but the Odyssey
did not leave Vyborg until June 20. It will stop at Kristiansand,
Norway, for supplies and some additional system testing before
heading off around Wednesday for the Mediterranean Sea and the Suez
Canal.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing's web site now shows the Odyssey's route as a dotted line
from Vyborg to Long Beach. Once the Odyssey leaves Norway, its
progress will be tracked by satellite and its location updated
daily as a solid line on the web site map, Hansen said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When that dotted line turns into a complete solid line, we
will be in Long Beach,'' he said. Odyssey's 14-acre homeport at
Long Beach is a converted Navy base.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the Odyssey, the Sea Launch project also includes
the Sea Commander, a 660-foot, specially designed rocket-assembly
and mission control ship that will carry up to 250 technicians.
</P>
<P>
   The Sea Commander, constructed at Govan Shipyard in Glasgow,
Scotland, left St. Petersburg on June 12 with the first Ukrainian
rocket. It will follow a different route than the Odyssey and will
pass through the Panama Canal before arriving in Long Beach July
11.
</P>
<P>
   Future rockets will be transported in pieces to Long Beach for
final assembly on the Sea Commander.
</P>
<P>
   Satellites will be mated to the 200-foot-long Zenit inside the
ship. The rocket will then be transferred to the Odyssey before a
10-day trip to the launch site near Christmas Island, which is
about 1,000 miles south of Hawaii. During that voyage, the rocket
is carried in a horizontal position.
</P>
<P>
   Before each launch, the Odyssey will be lowered into the ocean
to make it more stable. Its two giant pontoons can be filled with
15,000 tons of water, dropping the Odyssey so that 70 feet of the
20-story structure is below the water.
</P>
<P>
   The launch site in international waters was picked because it is
on the Equator, where the Earth's surface is moving eastward at
better than 1,000 miles per hour. A rocket fired there needs less
fuel to reach the 17,500 mph velocity need to reach orbit because
the the rocket is able to get the maximum boost from the Earth's
rotation. Less rocket fuel means less weight, which allows
increased payload capacity. What it all adds up to is that a rocket
launched from Odyssey can carry a heavier satellite at less cost to
the customer _ the key selling point for Sea Launch.
</P>
<P>
   Also, by firing the rocket in such a remote ocean location, the
first and second stages can fall harmlessly into the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing is a partner in Sea Launch with the European shipbuilder
Kvaerner of Oslo, Norway; Russia's RSC-Energia in Moscow; and the
Ukrainian company Yuzhnoye/Yuzhmash.
</P>
<P>
   Energia is the company that launched the first Sputnik and
designed the Russian Mir space station. It is also building
hardware for the International Space Station, for which Boeing is
prime contractor. The Ukrainian company is best known for building
the former Soviet Union's most mighty ICBM, the SS-18, dubbed by
the Pentagon as ``Satan.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than building a rocket designed to destroy U.S. cities,
Yuzhnoye/Yuzhmash workers are now producing the Zenit rocket for
Sea Launch and other commercial customers. It has been used more
than two dozen times to launch satellites into space. The third
stage of the rocket is the Block DM, developed by RSC-Energia. It
has successfully flown more than 150 times.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing has a 40 percent stake in Sea Launch. The other partners
have shares ranging from 15 percent to 25 percent. Boeing will not
give figures, but it reportedly has invested $500 million in the
project.
</P>
<P>
   It should prove to be a great investment, coming at a time when
not only more but new and cheaper rockets are needed to launch a
growing number of communication satellites. More than 1,000 such
satellites are scheduled to be sent into orbit over the next
decade, and customers must wait in line for available rockets.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Sea Launch has contracted 13 launch slots to Hughes
Space and Communications. The first rocket launched from Odyssey in
October will carry a new-generation Hughes communication satellite
into a stationary orbit 22,300 miles above Earth. Sea Launch also
has sold five launch slots to Loral Space &AMP; Communications.
</P>
<P>
   The project was conceived to win contracts from such
California-based satellite companies as Hughes. They can save money
because they do not have to pay the cost of transporting their
satellites to far-away launch sites in Russia, Japan, China or
French Guiana, as well as the two U.S.sites at Kennedy Space Center
and Vandenberg AFB in Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   It can costs upwards of $500,000 to haul a satellite in a Boeing
747 to most present-day launch sites.
</P>
<P>
   Sea Launch plans about 6 launches a year, with a typical launch
costing from $70 to $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the Odyssey may be left at its launch site so it
does not have to return to Long Beach after each firing. Instead
the Sea Commander would bring the rocket to the launch site. The
time saved could allow a dozen or more commercial launches a year,
the same number that now take place at launch sites such as Kennedy
Space Center, according to Sea Launch executives.
</P>
<P>
   The Sea Commander can also process two Zenits at a time, so
Odyssey could launch two rockets before the command ship has to
return to Long Beach for another rocket.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the launch site is in international waters, one
non-technical hitch has developed in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   The South Pafific Regional Environmental Programme in Somoa is
concerned that launching rockets so close to Christmas Island will
cause ecological damage. Each launch, according to the
organization, will result in 36 tons of carbon monoxide and 181
tons of carbon dioxide being emitted into the lower troposhpere. In
addition, it says, 4.5 tons of residual kerosene will produce a
slick when the first two stages of the rocket fall into the ocean
after after blast off.
</P>
<P>
   The organization's findings have been sent to its 22 member
countries for possible action, though its not clear what, if
anything, could be done to prevent this latest and most radical
entry into the satellite launching game.

   Graf should draw &QL; 
curtain on career
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
WIMBLEDON, England _ Natasha Zvereva left the Wimbledon grounds
Friday thinking she had played the greatest match of her
journeywoman career.
</P>
<P>
   And maybe she had. You beat Steffi Graf on Centre Court here,
and you have a right to believe you have done something big.
Particularly when, going in, you stood 0-17 against Ms. Graf.
Natasha spoke afterward of her mental toughness, of how she blocked
out ``all the distractions'' and the abject futility of the past,
and never lost her way.
</P>
<P>
   What she didn't mention was how Steffi, so tentative in her
shot-making and so lacking in the killer tenacity that carried her
to heights few players have known, never resembled the woman who
possesses seven Wimbledon titles.
</P>
<P>
   A woman who had lost only one match _ to Houston's Lori McNeil
in 1994 _ at the All-England Club from 1991 through 1996.
</P>
<P>
   If this is what it has come to for Graf, succumbing in straight
sets to a Natasha Zvereva in the third round, she should give
serious consideration to aborting her comeback and retiring with a
measure of dignity intact.
</P>
<P>
   We want to remember the real Steffi, the Panzer in a skirt, not
the slow-footed, error-prone cardboard cutout of same who went down
in 78 minutes to an opponent she had once routed 6-0, 6-0 in a
ridiculous 34-minute French Open final 10 summers ago.
</P>
<P>
   Confidence shattered
</P>
<P>
   Graf never broke Zvereva's serve. At the end, with a double
break point in hand and a chance to stay alive with Natasha's knees
all but shaking and her racket trembling, Steffi made two startling
errors, the kind the other player used to make against her.
</P>
<P>
   Zvereva thus would survive in spite of herself 6-4, 7-5.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not feeling any confidence out there,'' Graf said,
fighting back tears. ``I don't feel any rhythm at all.''
</P>
<P>
   She has a rebuilt knee but a broken game. At 29, with the
teen-age assassins such as Martina Hingis and Venus Williams taking
over the, ahem, women's tour, she has no hope of reclaiming the No.
1 ranking she held for the better part of a decade.
</P>
<P>
   No hope whatsover.
</P>
<P>
   And if Steffi can't be No. 1, settling for anything less seems
pointless.
</P>
<P>
   It's a shame she has to leave in such a fashion. Hingis snatched
Graf's crown by default, not by overtaking her, one on one, on the
court. Hingis ascended without having to defeat Graf in a major
final. But injuries are part of any sport, and Graf, who turned pro
shortly before her 14th birthday, has worn out. The grind defeated
her, not a peer.
</P>
<P>
   Of those, she had none. Granted, Monica Seles might have become
one, but we can't change her tragic history. We'll never know, will
we?
</P>
<P>
   Based on the evidence, on what we know, Graf deserves
consideration as the finest player in history. Her 21 Grand Slam
titles eclipsed Martina Navratilova's Open era record of 18 and
rank second only to Margaret Court's 24, nine of which were won at
the Australian Open during a period when many of the top players
didn't make the trip Down Under.
</P>
<P>
   The heart and guts that drove Graf to the top, then kept her
there through an extraordinary series of personal travails, stoked
her bid to return. But her talent, the third crucial part of the
equation, has been compromised by the extensive knee surgery that
followed a semifinal defeat at Roland Garros in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Injuries take severe toll
</P>
<P>
   Other injuries, byproducts of her long period of inactivity,
have followed, setting her back repeatedly. In early May, after she
had to pull out of the French Open, Graf conceded in an interview
with Tennis magazine: ``I can't live my life like this anymore.
It's just too difficult to keep training for months and then have
another injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``Training has consumed the entire day, every day. I've been
trying whatever it takes to come back, but I can't let this end up
ruling my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Another setback before Wimbledon, she swore, and she would call
it quits.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a long time since I was 100 percent,'' Steffi said.
``I just hope 65 percent is good enough.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't, even against an aging doubles specialist like
Zvereva.
</P>
<P>
   Now? Graf said she would honor her commitments in the weeks to
come but stopped short of promising to play the U.S. Open, much
less returning to Centre Court next year. Although she would love
to equal Navratilova's record of nine Wimbledon titles and top
Court's Grand Slam total, she must realize how slim-to-none her
chances have become on either count.
</P>
<P>
   It's time, Steffi. It's time.
</P>

EX-OFFICER DISPUTES PARTS OF CNN NERVE-GAS STORY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By LAWRIE MIFFLIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A former military officer used prominently by Cable News Network
in a report about the use of nerve gas in an attack during the
Vietnam War Friday disputed key points of CNN's representation of
his account.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview, Robert Van Buskirk, who was a
lieutenant in a secret special-forces platoon on a raid into Laos
in 1970, said he believes CNN's report of the attack is basically
accurate but that he did not confirm, as the network implied, that
a gas dropped on the rescue site that day was sarin, a lethal nerve
gas whose use is outlawed by international law. He said that he did
not know what gas was dropped but had been told later that it was
``a lethal gas.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, he said he had not told CNN that a soldier he confronted
and killed during that raid was an American defector, but had told
the producer that his victim was a blond Caucasian, and possibly
Russian.
</P>
<P>
   In the CNN report, however, Van Buskirk clearly says: ``This is
a GI.'' On Friday, he said that this had been his ``gut feeling''
but he had no proof.
</P>
<P>
   The CNN report, which was part of a new collaboration between
the network and its sister magazines at Time Inc., called ``CNN
NewsStand,'' appeared on June 7. The next day, a similar version
was published in Time magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Both reports asserted that the U.S. military had dropped sarin
on a Laotian village in 1970, as part of a secret mission called
Operation Tailwind, and had done so in pursuit of American
defectors who had been ordered killed. Both reports cited unnamed
military officials with knowledge of the secret mission as sources,
and also quoted eight former soldiers by name.
</P>
<P>
   Van Buskirk gave the most vivid account, about encountering the
blond man in the Laotian village, offering to rescue him as he fled
down a ``spider hole,'' then throwing a grenade into the hole after
him. He also told CNN's producer, April Oliver (who co-authored the
article in Time, with Peter Arnett), that he had repressed all
memory of this encounter until Ms. Oliver began questioning him for
her report.
</P>
<P>
   Neither CNN nor Time reported the recovered-memory aspect of Van
Buskirk's account. A week later, Newsweek magazine did, in an
article that tried to refute most of the CNN-Time report.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think CNN was wrong,'' in the gist of their report,
Van Buskirk said Friday. ``Maybe they edited our words to go along
with the line they wanted to take. But they didn't put words in my
mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Buskirk also disputed the CNN account of his exploits in an
interview with Gary Matsumoto of the Fox News Channel (an all-news
cable channel and competitor to CNN), seen Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Almost immediately after the ``CNN-NewsStand'' report appeared,
it was denounced by former military officers, some of whom accused
CNN's producers of ignoring interviews and evidence that undercut
their poison-gas thesis. But CNN defended the report, saying that
military officers were usually sworn to secrecy about such
operations, and that some officers would feel bound to cover up or
lie about secret operations, even 28 years later.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon has begun an investigation into the accusations.
And both Time and CNN are investigating the report's accuracy, Time
using one of its own Washington bureau reporters, and CNN hiring
Floyd Abrams, the noted First Amendment lawyer, to work with its
general counsel, David Kohler, on an internal investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not surprising that there is some controversy over the
facts, given the nature of the story,'' a CNN spokesman, Howard
Polskin, said Friday. He added that CNN executives would not
comment further until Abrams and Kohler finish their investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Matsumoto also interviewed Adm. Thomas Moorer, who was the
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in 1970, and Lt. Col. Eugene
McCarley, who was a captain and the commander of the Tailwind
operation on the mission in dispute. Both men denied having told
CNN that one objective of their mission was to kill American
defectors. Moorer also told Matusmoto that he had never told CNN
that sarin nerve gas was used.
</P>
<P>
   ``I explained many times to the interviewers that I never saw a
document,'' Moorer said on Fox News. ``I never saw battle plans. I
never saw a battle report. And, I would not confirm such an event
if I didn't have it documented.''

2 JAPANESE INVITED TO SPEAK ON WAR CRIMES ARE DENIED ENTRY TO
U.S. 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Nanjing in organization name in 5th graf is CQ.) 
(ja) 
 By JAMES DAO     
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Two years ago, when the Department of Justice
created a list of suspected Japanese war criminals who would be
prohibited from entering the United States, veterans and Asian
American groups were delighted. Finally, they said, people who had
raped, butchered or experimented on civilians and prisoners during
World War II would be treated like the ex-Nazis who faced similar
prohibitions.
</P>
<P>
   But this week, when American officials used that watch list for
the first time to bar a Japanese man from entering the country,
those same groups were enraged. The reason was simple: The man,
Yoshio Shinozuka, was their guest.
</P>
<P>
   Shinozuka had been a member of a Japanese military unit that
conducted biological experiments on war prisoners in Manchuria. He
was to lecture about Japanese war crimes as part of an entourage of
Japanese lawyers and former soldiers scheduled to visit New York,
Washington and other cities in the coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Their aim, which some State Department officials share, is to
build pressure on the Japanese government to make formal apologies
to its war victims and pay them reparations.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a miscarriage of law,'' said Tzu Ping Shao, a founder
of a New York group called the Alliance in Memory of Victims of the
Nanjing Massacre, which sponsored Shinozuka. ``They are not touring
for pleasure, they are not doing business or trying to sell books.
They are here just to repent, to apologize, to explain, to expose,
to do everything just.''
</P>
<P>
   Immigration officials blocked Shinozuka from entering the
country at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago on Wednesday and
then put him on the next flight to Tokyo. On Thursday, Attorney
General Janet Reno rejected an appeal by Shinozuka's lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   A second man who planned to join the American lecture tour,
Shiro Azuma, was also recently notified by the Department of
Justice that he was on the watch list and could not enter the
country. Azuma has confessed to raping women during the Rape of
Nanking. Historians estimate that as many as 300,000 Chinese were
killed in Nanking in seven weeks in 1937 and 1938.
</P>
<P>
   There is another twist to the story. Shinozuka, 75, and Azuma,
86, are on the watch list because they publicly recanted their
crimes. Those forceful apologies, which earned them the enmity of
many Japanese, also brought them to the attention of the American
officials who added their names to the watch list.
</P>
<P>
   ``In these two cases, it is the fact that they spoke publicly
that brought them to our attention,'' said Eli Rosenbaum, director
of the Office of Special Investigations, which handles World War
II-era war crimes for the Justice Department. ``I appreciate the
irony of that, but the law must be applied in all cases.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what these men have to say is important and it
deserves a wide audience,'' he added, ``but that audience can be
reached without having them physically enter the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosenbaum's office was created in 1979 when Congress passed a
law requiring the United States to denaturalize, deport or block
the entry of anyone suspected of committing war crimes for the
Nazis or their allies. Since then, the office has stripped American
citizenship from 59 people, all European immigrants, and barred
several hundred others from entering the country. There are now
60,000 people on the watch list, of whom only 33 are Japanese.
</P>
<P>
   The most famous of the office's targets was Kurt Waldheim, the
former U.N. secretary general. In 1987, when he was president of
Austria, he was prohibited from visiting the United States after
documents were released implicating him in the deportation of Greek
Jews to death camps while he served in the German Army during the
war.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenbaum said Justice Department officials felt that they could
not make an exception for Azuma and Shinozuka because that would
encourage a flood of waiver applications from unsavory characters
wanting to apologize in America for their crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is the government supposed to evaluate their sincerity?'' he
asked. ``What happens if they come here and refuse to leave, or
fall ill and we can't remove them? And I wonder whether people are
prepared for the spectacle on their evening news of Nazi and
Japanese war criminals dining at the best restaurants in Manhattan
and Los Angeles. I doubt it.''
</P>
<P>
   Asian Americans and human rights advocates have been united in
demanding that Japan take greater responsibility for its war
crimes. But they are divided over the decision to deny Shinozuka
and Azuma entry into the United States. The Simon Wiesenthal Center
in Los Angeles and a Washington group representing Korean women who
were forced to provide sex to Japanese soldiers have supported the
Justice Department's position.
</P>
<P>
   ``A week doesn't go by that one of these people doesn't try to
have a vacation in the United States,'' said Rabbi Abraham Cooper,
associate dean of the Simon Wiesenthal Center, which has offered to
let Azuma and Shinozuka speak to Americans from Japan through its
video conferencing center. ``This is an important symbolic
punishment. Once you breach it, it all will go.''
</P>
<P>
   But the rights groups sponsoring the two men say the United
States should encourage their speaking out, not punish it, since
both have faced severe ostracism, including death threats, in
Japan. Many conservatives in Japan contend that events like the
Rape of Nanking never occurred. And mainstream politicians often
portray the nation as a victim, not the aggressor, in World War II,
emphasizing the point that the United States dropped atom bombs on
Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
</P>
<P>
   ``All rules should have exceptions for the right reasons,'' said
Gilbert Hair, executive director of the Center for Internee Rights
in Miami Beach, whose father died while a prisoner of the Japanese.

<P>
   KEY WEST, Fla. _ Mel Fisher, whose notorious optimism in the
face of death, debt and doubting investors led him to the richest
shipwreck in history, must wonder where the good times have gone.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen years after striking a treasure trove in the azure
waters of the Florida Keys, a Spanish galleon that has already
yielded $500 million, Fisher is fighting a state suspicion that he
sold fake coins, a federal court finding that he harmed the
environment and an international movement to rein in private
salvage, a business Fisher personified with his motto, ``Finders
keepers.''
</P>
<P>
   At a gathering of 200 investors that was interrupted by a police
raid and seizure of suspected forged coins from his shop, the
75-year-old Fisher, bent and bald from chemotherapy, admitted, ``It
hasn't been that good a year.''
</P>
<P>
   That's for sure. He had to dip into his private stash of coins
and emeralds to ensure a return to his faithful. With the new
accusations of fraud against him this spring, he is again being
dogged by those who call him a modern-day pirate. And Fisher is not
the only one in the industry under siege; in many ways the golden
age of treasure hunting appears to be over.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental, cultural and historical forces are merging to
fundamentally alter the practice of shipwreck salvage. Along
America's traditionally laissez-faire coastline, new regulations
are placing wrecks off limits or making them tough to retrieve. Of
thousands of known wrecks, fewer than 20 are under salvage permit.
Half are Fisher's.
</P>
<P>
   Even offshore, in what had been unregulated ocean where
salvagers go in search of the ultimate payoff, there is no peace.
At the urging of archeologists and historians from many countries,
the United Nations will begin debating June 29 in Paris a treaty to
protect shipwrecks worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think private salvage will exist in five years,'' said
Ben Benson of Sea Hunt, a self-financed explorer who in March spent
$7,000 a day for legal fees to clear permits for two Spanish wrecks
off Virginia. ``It's one of the last bastions of pure, free
enterprise and risk taking, and it doesn't seem to fit into the
regulatory society we seem to be in.''
</P>
<P>
   Archeologists say underwater treasures deserve the same
protection as artifacts on public lands.
</P>
<P>
   ``With new technology, salvage operators can find and destroy
every shipwreck on the planet,'' said Larry Murphy, an archeologist
with the National Park Service.
</P>
<P>
   No one faces the pressure to change like Fisher, a former
chicken farmer who, after finding a doubloon off Florida in the
1960s, began chasing X's on treasure maps. At the time, salvage was
based on British Admiralty law, which considered the work of
salvagers in the public interest.
</P>
<P>
   American law was written here in the Florida Keys, where
salvagers raced to wrecks on the reef, then filed claims in federal
court. Rights to salvage the Titanic were rewarded that way. In a
Supreme Court case, Fisher extended the law to abandoned
shipwrecks.
</P>
<P>
   With the invention of huge sand blasters, sensitive
magnetometers and side-scan sonar dragged over thousands of miles
of ocean, Fisher turned a snorkeling hobby into what one
archeologist called strip mining.
</P>
<P>
   It was boring work. Bombs, beer cans and even a sunken
Volkswagen caused false alarms. Fisher spurred his workers with the
motto ``Today's the Day,'' even after a son and daughter-in-law
drowned.
</P>
<P>
   He was most inventive in raising $13 million for 18 years of
hunting. Living in a houseboat that sank frequently, Fisher sold
shares in several companies, sold coins as he found them, sold
diving excursions to the wrecks. He wrote out one deal on a
cocktail napkin that turned out to be worth millions when, in July
1985, he finally found the mother lode of the Atocha, a Spanish
galleon that went down in 1622.
</P>
<P>
   Archeology took a back seat as silver coins, gold chains and
artifacts were hauled 50 feet from the ocean floor in milk crates.
There were so many shoe-box-sized silver ingots that at Fisher's
ramshackle headquarters here, his staff dismisses them as
doorstops.
</P>
<P>
   The Atocha created a handful of millionaires, including the
Fisher family, said David Paul Horan, Fisher's lawyer at the time.
It also made a folk hero of Fisher, especially in Key West, where
boats and businesses were purchased with treasure and dozens hang
Atocha coins around their necks.
</P>
<P>
   But others have long accused him of salting the dive site and
exaggerating the value of treasure.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher has never lost a court case, Horan said, but he has
settled several with treasure. One lawyer, who was paid with
treasure he later called fake, forced a special prosecutor's
investigation. A grand jury declined to bring charges.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Fisher sells one-year limited partnerships for a 35
percent share in his continuing hunt, for amounts ranging from
$6,250 to $400,000.
</P>
<P>
   Jean Thornton, a public school counselor from Birmingham, Ala.,
who invested $6,250 after posing for a photo draped in Fisher's
gold chains, sold her first year's emerald for $10,000 and
reinvested. Now she has signed on for a third year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm kinda hooked is what I am,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Fisher, Mel's son, said the other half of Treasure Salvors'
$1.7 million budget comes from selling artifacts and coins, most of
which come with a certificate of authenticity signed by Fisher, a
marketing device that elevates $7 in silver bullion to an $1,800
keepsake. Of 90,000 marketable Atocha coins, all but 3,000 have
been sold.
</P>
<P>
   This spring, an investor who paid $5,900 for a gold coin said to
be from a 1733 Spanish fleet became suspicious and asked the
authorities to investigate.
</P>
<P>
   Kirk Zuelch, state attorney for Monroe County, said the coin,
plus 35 similar coins seized at Fisher's gift shop and supplied by
other customers since the raid, are counterfeit, according to two
experts consulted by his investigators. The coins contain too much
gold and lack distinctive details, they say. Zuelch has not decided
whether to file charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fisher has sold lots of authentic coins _ why would a man, at
his stage in life, get caught up in something like this?''
rhetorically asked one state expert, Dr. Alan Craig, a retired
professor of Latin American studies. ``He's learned that there is
always someone who wants to buy into the romance of get rich
quick.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Fisher says he has never sold fake coins but concedes that he
signed the certificate saying he found the coins, when, in fact, he
bought them for less than $1,000 apiece from Walter Kruse, a
longtime associate who in 1975 was convicted in Pennsylvania of
selling fake coins. Fisher says he did not know about the
conviction, but with his credibility damaged, he has hired
metallurgy experts who he says support the coins' authenticity.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher's ability to sell dreams and shrug off doubters may have
no equal in the treasure world, but his success has come back to
haunt him.
</P>
<P>
   The Atocha discovery spawned a scramble for treasure, with 50
shipwreck claims filed in American waters in the next few years. It
also galvanized archeologists, historians and environmentalists,
who feared the loss of priceless artifacts and the destruction of
ecosystems.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987 Congress approved the Abandoned Shipwreck Act, which
ended Admiralty law and gave states title to wrecks within three
miles of the coastline. In the decade since, states have virtually
stopped writing salvage permits and 541 underwater sites have been
placed on the National Register of Historic Places, said Anne
Giesecke, who wrote the act.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher, who has six salvage permits that were grandfathered into
the law, is appealing a $589,000 fine imposed by a federal judge
last year after another son blew 100 craters in sea grass inside
the Florida Keys Marine Sanctuary.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Causey, the sanctuary's superintendent, said it was not
his intention to stop treasure hunting. ``Our job is to protect the
resource,'' he said. ``But you can't build a house in the Keys the
way you did in the '50s.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposal before Unesco's panel of experts next week extends
this idea to the edge of the continental shelf of every country, a
200-mile cultural heritage zone that would require salvagers to
file research plans and apply to the ship's country of origin.
</P>
<P>
   The specific language will be debated for quite a while,
officials say, but with the writing on the wall, modern salvage
operators have proposed a number of alternatives to ``finders
keepers.'' In North Carolina, a private salvager is donating
Blackbeard's flagship to the state in return for salvage rights to
a gold-laden Spanish ship.
</P>
<P>
   One group of prominent salvagers formed a professional
association ``to write standards, to better police our activities
and establish a certain level of credibility for our operations,''
said Peter Hess, a lawyer coordinating the effort.
</P>
<P>
   Salvagers want to preserve the right to sell artifacts to
private collectors. But the newest wrinkle is the private,
for-profit collection. Barry Clifford of Provincetown, Mass., is
salvaging the Whydah, a pirate ship whose crew included escaped
slaves, and charging admission. ``I can't bring myself to divide
and sell it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   RMS Titanic Inc. is netting $1 million every three months from
three traveling exhibits of 5,000 artifacts. ``The company has not
recovered its $20 million investment, but we have an appreciating
asset,'' said its president, George Tulloch.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, few if any of Fisher's imitators have recouped their
investments. One 1990 study of 20 shipwrecks found that just one _
Fisher's _ made money. In this century, only one other wreck the
Atocha's size has been found, the Central America off South
Carolina, with $1.2 billion in coins and bullion. The search for
that treasure was chronicled in the recent best seller, ``Ship of
Gold in the Deep Blue Sea,'' by Gary Kinder (Atlantic Monthly
Press).
</P>
<P>
   As known wrecks are picked over and hunts move offshore, the
risks and costs for investors increase, said James Miller,
Florida's state archeologist, who considers the chances of success
today about the same as winning the Florida lottery.
</P>
<P>
   But with modern technology, many believe that another golden age
of salvage will begin after deepwater regulations are decided. But
the treasure may be history, not gold, said Paul Johnston, curator
of maritime history for the Smithsonian Institution, who is
excavating the royal yacht of the King of Hawaii, sunk in 1824.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where we have made progress is in recognizing that these are
limited resources that need to be protected for the benefit of all,
not just a few salvagers who want to line their pocket,'' he said.
``This is a diminishing marine resource, like whales, that need
some kind of international care.''
</P>
<P>
   Fisher, whose fight with cancer began about the time he
discovered the Atocha, insists his business will survive him, as
his children take over. In the meantime, he still runs the business
of selling dreams.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at this,'' he said to a group that stepped into his
office not long ago, pointing out a pattern of sonar echoes, the
modern equivalent of the X on a treasure map. ``If that's what I
think it is, we've found the Margarita, 40 tons of gold and silver
and over $2 billion in emeralds and lots of other stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Really? No!'' said one visitor. Without missing a beat, Fisher
slid over a blank contract seeking $50,000.

EDITORIAL OBSERVER: IS VIKTOR ORBAN TOO OLD TO LEAD HUNGARY? 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By TINA ROSENBERG    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Viktor Orban, the prime minister-designate of Hungary,
celebrated his 35th birthday last month, and many are wondering if
power has not found him too late.
</P>
<P>
   Across the former East Bloc some of the most dynamic,
Westernized politicians are relatively youthful. The most
influential are Sergei Kiriyenko, Russia's 35-year-old reformist
prime minister, and his deputy Boris Nemtsov, 38. In American terms
they are free-market Republicans on economics, liberal Democrats on
social issues. Orban, whose statist politics are just the reverse,
was like them once, back when he was young.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s Orban's party, the Federation of Young
Democrats, or Fidesz, was the most popular in Hungary. Its selling
point was that it was open only to those under 35. Hungary's youth
grew up in a free and Westernized country by communist standards,
without the listlessness of those who lived under a harsher regime.
To voters, youth meant energy and efficiency. It meant Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Fidesz was born at a Budapest college that Orban and several
other students established in the early 1980s so they could study
democracy, largely in English. Once communism fell, the students
formed Fidesz. Hungary already had a party of Vaclav Havel-type
dissidents, but many Hungarians considered them soft and naive, and
disdained their warnings about the shallowness of capitalist
society.
</P>
<P>
   ``For years, the dissidents based their politics on morality,
not the political game,'' Orban told me in an interview in 1992.
``That is in the nature of the underground, and they have not been
able to change.''
</P>
<P>
   Fidesz, by contrast, was a party of Thatcherite sharks. Led by
the brash and arrogant Orban, its politicians dressed like models _
one parliamentarian posed for a Levi's ad _ and held campaign rock
concerts.
</P>
<P>
   While other parties' TV ads resembled the old commie spots
urging increased potato production, Fidesz ads looked like MTV.
They were produced by the East Bloc's first political consulting
firm, which Fidesz, touchingly naive about its cynicism, publicly
touted as a great stride westward.
</P>
<P>
   But in the next elections, in 1994, Fidesz did poorly.
Hungarians liked the image of Fidesz, but in an era of economic
trouble did not want to see their social programs cut. Orban began
to revise his ideas. Some Fidesz members split off and joined the
traditional dissident party. Those who remained emulated Orban's
about-face. He is now an economic populist and on social issues
takes a conservative Catholic line. The party no longer has an age
limit.
</P>
<P>
   As prime minister he will lead a coalition that includes a party
of small farmers, which has endorsed such dubious ideas as a ban on
foreign ownership of land. Orban himself has made some alarmingly
nationalist statements and unrealistic economic promises. The day
after the elections, Hungary's stock market dropped 8.7 percent.
Now he is once again shifting positions, trying to reassure foreign
investors that they should keep flooding Hungary. The stock market
has bounced back.
</P>
<P>
   Orban's politics may yet lurch a few more times before his
career is over, but so far, political expediency seems to have
trumped youth. Age is not a foolproof predictor of politics. The
worst leader in the former communist world is probably Belarus'
president, Alexander Lukashenko. A former director of a state farm,
he speaks of his admiration for Hitler and Stalin. His policies are
firmly frozen in the 1950s. He is 43. &QL;

EDITORIAL: A CLEAR RULING ON HARASSMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (See related stories: SCOTUS-HARASS, SCOTUS-HARASS-REACT,
SCOTUS-HARASS-JONES, SCOTUS-JEOPARDY) 
(lb) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, June 27:
</P>
<P>
   With a pair of 7-2 decisions Friday, the Supreme Court ended its
term on a constructive note by strengthening the law governing
sexual harassment in the workplace. The rulings, in cases from Boca
Raton, Fla., and Chicago, reasonably interpreted Title VII of the
Civil Rights Act to hold that an employer can be held liable for
sexual misconduct by supervisors, whether or not the employer knew
about it.
</P>
<P>
   The court also said the employer can be liable whether or not
the employee suffered adverse job consequences for refusing a
supervisor's unwelcome advances.
</P>
<P>
   The rulings properly recognize that language in the statute
defining the term ``employer'' includes both employers and their
``agents.'' They are also an acknowledgment that sexual harassment
causes serious harm even when there is no provable job retaliation
or economic loss.
</P>
<P>
   However, the court's balanced approach left room for employers
to mount a successful defense by, for example, showing that
employees had ``unreasonably failed to take advantage of any
preventive or corrective opportunities provided by the employer.''
</P>
<P>
   The ruling seems unlikely to have much impact on Paula Jones'
sexual-harassment suit against President Clinton. Her lawyers hope
to be helped by the court's holding that victims who suffer no
tangible economic harm may still bring a lawsuit. But in dismissing
her case, U.S. Judge Susan Webber Wright found that Clinton had
never made a clear threat, which remains a prerequisite for her
claim of harassment.
</P>
<P>
   The new rulings make an earlier sexual-harassment decision by
the court this week look all the worse. That ruling, applying an
analogous statute, effectively deprived students harassed in school
of any effective legal remedy. Congress still has the power to
correct that mistake, and it should. &QL;

DAVID AYALON, 84, SCHOLAR OF MUSLIM HISTORY AND ARABIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JOEL GREENBERG   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ David Ayalon, a scholar of Muslim history who
pioneered research on the Mameluke dynasties of Egypt and compiled
what is considered the most authoritative Arabic-Hebrew dictionary,
died in Jerusalem on June 25. He was 84.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, acquaintances said.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Haifa in 1914, Ayalon received a doctorate from the
Hebrew University in Jerusalem and founded its department of modern
Middle East studies in 1949, heading it until 1956. From 1963 to
1967 he headed the Institute of Asian and African Studies at the
Hebrew University.
</P>
<P>
   He was most widely known in Israel for the Arabic-Hebrew
dictionary that he compiled with Professor Pesach Shinar. The
volume has become a standard tool for generations of Israeli
students of Arabic and a resource for Arabic speakers studying
Hebrew. First published in 1947, the ``Arabic-Hebrew Dictionary of
Modern Arabic'' has gone through 22 printings and has sold more
than 80,000 copies.
</P>
<P>
   Ayalon did ground-breaking research on the Mamelukes, a military
caste of former slaves that ruled Egypt from 1250 to 1517.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today he is undoubtedly first in the world in the study of
this field,'' Shinar said. ``The bottom line of his research was
that it was the Mamelukes who saved Islam from the invading Mongols
who sacked Baghdad. He had a broad view, and his work covered wide
areas that were critical to the fate of the region and the history
of Islam.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1972 Ayalon was awarded Israel's highest civilian award, the
Israel Prize, for his studies of the army and society in Muslim
lands. He was recently named an honorary member of the American
Historical Association, becoming one of only 82 foreign scholars so
recognized since the first honorary membership was awarded in 1885.
</P>
<P>
   He contributed articles to the Encyclopedia of Islam, and his
latest work, ``Eunuchs, Caliphs and Sultans,'' is to be published
in Israel in the coming months.
</P>
<P>
   Ayalon is survived by his wife, Professor Myriam Rosen-Ayalon of
the Hebrew University, a leading authority on Islamic art and
archaeology.

MARK HARRINGTON, 51, HEAD OF MSNBC NEWS STATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BARBARA STEWART   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mark H. Harrington, a television news executive who
managed to get MSNBC, the 24-hour news cable station, up and
operating in six months and who directed the CBS News coverage of
major events like presidential conventions and the Olympics, died
at his home in Manhattan on June 25.
</P>
<P>
   He was 51.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was melanoma, said NBC News president Andrew Lack.
</P>
<P>
   Harrington never shared the dream of most young television
journalists: to stand in front of a camera and report the news to
millions of viewers. From the beginning, he preferred the role of
orchestra conductor, overseeing the myriad details of producing a
news program out of the audience's sight.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would pull the strands together so seamlessly that people
would forget he was involved,'' said Howard Stringer, president of
the Sony Corporation of America and former president of CBS. ``He
was the ultimate collaborator, and almost English in shunning the
spotlight.''
</P>
<P>
   Harrington began pulling together strands of major projects as
an undergraduate at Harvard, where he managed the crew of
collegiate oarsmen who rowed in the 1968 Olympics in Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   After receiving a master's degree in journalism at Columbia
University, he became CBS News' whiz kid of the early 1970s,
producing live news specials for Walter Cronkite and Dan Rather. He
would sit off camera a few feet below the anchor with a pile of
index cards he had compiled, which were crammed with facts, figures
and historical anecdotes.
</P>
<P>
   At 27, he won an Emmy Award for ``The Watergate Transcripts,'' a
special program he produced in 1974 on the incriminating tapes from
President Nixon's Oval Office. He subsequently became producer of
the ``CBS Evening News,'' with Walter Cronkite and later Dan
Rather; the London Bureau chief, and a vice president in charge of
overseeing the network's coverage of the Winter Olympics in
Albertville, France, in 1992 and Lillehammer, Norway, two years
later.
</P>
<P>
   Harrington is survived by his wife, Kyle Good, a freelance
television producer and director, and a son, David.
</P>
<P>
   He did not hesitate to correct the British news gatherers'
grammar, ignoring their irritation that he, an American, would
criticize their speech. But as a journalist, he interviewed people
from around the world, easily and without judgment. As London
bureau chief, he encouraged investigations into police corruption
and soccer hooliganism, which became major issues.
</P>
<P>
   The startup of MSNBC in July 1996 was probably the largest and
most pressured job in a career of big deadline projects. As vice
president and general manager, Harrington was given six months to
create a round-the-clock news service from scratch, the first
station to compete with CNN in the coverage of live, breaking news.
In that time he had to find and hire 400 employees, develop 120
hours of weekly programming and oversee the opening of two
headquarters: a temporary one in Fort Lee, N.J. and a permanent one
in Secaucus, N.J.
</P>

CLINTON, JIANG TO TARGET NUCLEAR WEAPONS, TECHNOLOGY DURING TALKS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CRAGG HINES 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ A retired U.S. general recently recalled one version
of how China came to join the nuclear club.
</P>
<P>
   When military advisers proposed building an atomic bomb 50 years
ago, supreme leader Mao Tse-tung asked: ``Why should I do this?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Other nations have them,'' came the answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I guess we should have some,'' Mao supposedly replied.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not China began developing its atomic arsenal in such
an offhand manner, there can be no question that when President
Clinton sat down Saturday for talks with Chinese President Jiang
Zemin, the proliferation of nuclear weapons and technology was a
key item on the agenda. It will also be one of the most difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly the important basket (of agenda items) is ... the
control of weapons of mass destruction,'' U.S. Ambassador James
Sasser said earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Tests late this spring by India and Pakistan confirmed that two
more nations have nuclear capabilities. Given China's overarching
interests and intrigues in Asia, and the U.S. position as the
founding and leading member of the nuclear elite, the issue moved
to the top of the list.
</P>
<P>
   How Clinton and Jiang can significantly advance the nuclear
debate is not clear, with any progress expected to be incremental.
</P>
<P>
   Complicating discussions are allegations that because of a
Clinton administration waiver, a U.S. satellite company, Loral
Space and Communications, gave China advice on making its missile
targeting more accurate. Loral's chief executive, Bernard Schwartz,
was the largest individual donor to the Democratic National
Committee in the 1996 election cycle.
</P>
<P>
   For China, the nuclear issue is difficult because it has been
accused of supplying critical nuclear technology to Pakistan as
well as exporting nuclear-capable missiles to Iran.
</P>
<P>
   In the days since the Indian and Pakistani tests, the Clinton
administration has been careful not to wag its finger at China, in
part because of the critical role Beijing can play in turning back
the nuclear clock in South Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of its history with both countries, China must be part
of any ultimate resolution of this matter,'' Clinton has said.
</P>
<P>
   The nuclear highlight of Clinton's nine-day visit may be a
symbolic announcement that the nations have decided to remove each
other as targets for intercontinental nuclear missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Bates Gill, director of the East Asia Nonproliferation Project
at the Monterey (Calif.) Institute of International Studies, said
other deals might include a belated Chinese pledge to publish a
formal list of nuclear-related materials that cannot be exported.
</P>
<P>
   Lack of a formal list has been part of an argument that the
Chinese top leadership does not know exactly what military
officials are selling other nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the Chinese themselves are finding and starting to
concede is that they do have some problems enforcing the writ of
the central government ... over the whole spectrum of people who
export technology or expertise,'' Ambassador Sasser told Agence
France-Presse.
</P>
<P>
   A series of steps could also be advanced to heighten contacts
between the Pentagon and the Chinese Defense Ministry _ an
unthinkable relationship only years ago and one which still
troubles some U.S. critics of Clinton's China policy.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the progress on nuclear and other defense issues is
slow, some Americans question truly engaging the Chinese on the
issues at all, primarily because the critics doubt whether the
Communist nation can be trusted.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., who chairs the Foreign Relations
Committee, believes the White House has deliberately overlooked
evidence that China has sold M-11 missiles to Pakistan in order to
escape ratcheting up sanctions against Beijing _ including a ban on
satellite exports.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon Oehler, former director of the CIA's Nonproliferation
Center, told Helms' committee earlier this month that there was
``no question'' that China had sold the entire missile, not just
parts as the administration contends.
</P>
<P>
   An administration finding that entire missiles were sold would
have triggered an automatic ban on almost all high-tech sales to
China.
</P>
<P>
   ``The administration has sought to shield China,'' Helms said.
</P>
<P>
   But other analysts support Clinton's plan for engagement on the
nuclear issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly cannot afford to isolate (China), particularly in
areas of such important security concern,'' Gill said. ``To do so
weakens our ability to understand Chinese views, Chinese
approaches, Chinese doctrinal and strategic viewpoints. And that
would be a mistake over the longer term.''
</P>
<P>
   At issue is what is known as ``dual-use'' technology and
equipment _ goods and know-how that have both commercial and
military applications.
</P>
<P>
   Direct sales of military equipment from U.S. firms to China are
forbidden, even though some analysts believe that if a U.S. firm
does not sell the Chinese what they want, a firm from another
nation will.
</P>
<P>
   ``To what extent could you slow down China's progress if you
wanted to?'' asked Nicholas R. Lardy, a senior fellow at the
Brookings Institution in Washington. ``It's very modest, since
almost all the technology that China would like to buy from us they
can also buy from the French, the Germans or ... the Russians.''
</P>
<P>
   But money can't buy everything, an analyst observed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Simple access to the technology does not translate, by a far
stretch, into deployed systems capable of threatening the United
States or other interests in the Western Pacific,'' Gill said. ``In
fact, in the case of China, they've had enormous difficulties
integrating these kinds of technologies.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese nuclear program was initially subsidized by the
former Soviet Union, but the Beijing-Moscow relationship had turned
cold by 1964 when China exploded its first atom bomb.
</P>
<P>
   The Indian and Pakistani tests are a dramatic reminder of the
edgy geopolitical game that has run for years across the Himalayas
and to the northwest, including one war between China and India and
three between India and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   China has long sided with Pakistan and believes that Washington
is equally firmly aligned with New Delhi.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts contend that Beijing believes Washington knew
about India's plans to test and let them happen to throw the Jiang
government off balance. At any rate, Beijing almost certainly knew
in advance about Pakistan's retaliatory testing.
</P>
<P>
   Despite this, China and the United States have in response
``been more together than apart,'' said Bruce D. Larkin, a
political scientist at the University of California at Santa Cruz.
He finds that encouraging, given Beijing's history on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once upon a time, the Chinese line was leave us alone,''
Larkin said.

EDITORIAL: CHINA'S RUDE RECEPTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, June 27:
</P>
<P>
   The ceremonial part of President Clinton's welcome may be fit
for an emperor, but other aspects of the Chinese government's
behavior have looked like calculated insults. By detaining several
democracy advocates during the president's stop in Xian and
imposing heavy surveillance on other democrats in Beijing, Chinese
leaders have seriously embarrassed Clinton. He must respond
personally, publicly and bluntly.
</P>
<P>
   As Beijing well knows, Clinton took considerable political risks
to go through with this trip. By making his presence a pretext for
picking up political activists, China's leaders demonstrated
indifference to his efforts on their behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton politely but clearly deplored the detentions before
leaving Xian on Friday. His national security adviser, Samuel
Berger, spoke more sharply, warning that ``people are not debris to
be swept up for a visitor.'' But now, after China's disdainful
rebuff of a diplomatic protest from Ambassador James Sasser,
Clinton must forcefully register his unhappiness with his Chinese
hosts over the incident. He has several opportunities to do so this
weekend as the political heart of the visit unfolds in Beijing,
following his arrival in Tiananmen Square late last night New York
time.
</P>
<P>
   Sweeping potential demonstrators away from international
visitors is a sadly familiar Chinese practice. But that repressive
tradition is not something a U.S. president can endorse by silence
when it is waved in front of him.
</P>
<P>
   President Jiang Zemin wanted Clinton to visit China this year as
a symbol of improving ties between Beijing and Washington. But real
improvement is retarded when China flaunts its methods of stifling
dissent during this visit.
</P>
<P>
   Responding strongly to these detentions is not simply about
political damage control in Washington. It is an integral part of
building a new and healthier relationship with China, which should
be Clinton's main goal on this visit. Such a relationship cannot be
built on the premise that Beijing is free to deliver angry
diatribes whenever it feels offended but that Washington must
always be deferentially polite.
</P>
<P>
   That kind of double standard invites dangerous diplomatic
misunderstandings. It also understandably builds resentment among
the American people, who are already uneasy over charges of Chinese
interference in the 1996 presidential campaign and lax U.S.
supervision of Chinese satellite contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's preference was to avoid any appearance of rudeness on
this trip. But Beijing's lack of courtesy compels him to raise his
voice.

JUDGE DENIES MOTION TO DISMISS SUIT AGAINST TAWANA BRAWLEY'S
ADVISERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ps) 
 By WILLIAM GLABERSON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The judge in the defamation case against Tawana Brawley's
advisers ruled Friday that the plaintiff, Steven Pagones, had
provided enough evidence to get his case to the jury, perhaps as
soon as early July.
</P>
<P>
   More than seven months after the trial began in the decade-old
dispute, Justice S. Barrett Hickman of State Supreme Court denied a
request by the three defendants, Alton Maddox Jr., C. Vernon Mason
and the Rev. Al Sharpton, to dismiss the lawsuit. The three men
were advisers to Miss Brawley, a black teen-ager who said she had
been raped by a group of white men in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suffice it to say,'' Hickman said in his ruling, ``in the
court's opinion, there was adequate evidence, both direct and
circumstantial, presented by plaintiff that would support a
reasonable jury finding that plaintiff Steven Pagones has
established actual malice with convincing clarity.'' The decision
was released in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., where the trial is being held.
</P>
<P>
   The courts require a finding of ``actual malice'' for there to
be a verdict that a public official was defamed. Actual malice has
been defined as reckless disregard for the truth.
</P>
<P>
   Pagones was an assistant district attorney in Dutchess County
when the three advisers named him as one of Miss Brawley's
attackers. Pagones filed his suit in 1988, after a grand jury
exonerated him and discredited Miss Brawley's account.
</P>
<P>
   Hickman's ruling Frisday dismissed one count in Pagones'
complaint. The judge agreed with the advisers that one of the many
statements they made at the time was not defamatory. He also ruled
that another count was duplicative. But more than 20 claims by
Pagones that he was defamed were left intact for the six-person
jury to consider.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For days, Hickman has been meeting with the lawyers in an effort
to agree on the instructions that he will give to the jurors before
they begin deliberating. One disputed issue has been what the judge
will tell the jurors about how to evaluate the fact that the
defendants did not call Miss Brawley as a witness.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers familiar with the negotiations who spoke on the
condition of anonymity said Hickman has concluded that he will tell
the jurors that they can draw negative inferences, such as that
Miss Brawley's testimony might have contradicted the defense
position.
</P>
<P>
   Hickman has apparently concluded that, of the three defendants,
Maddox had the closest ties to the Brawley family, the lawyers
said, and therefore could have exercised some control over whether
she appeared as a witness. For that reason, they said, the judge
will tell the jurors that Maddox is the only one against whom they
can draw such negative inferences.
</P>
<P>
   Closing statements are tentatively scheduled to begin Tuesday
and may last at least until July 7. If the jurors find that Pagones
was defamed, a second phase of the trial would then be held to set
damages.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Pagones, who is 36, said he was pleased by the judge's
decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am anxious to get this case to the jury and close this
chapter of my life,'' he said. &QL;

GORE WHIPS UP TEXAS DEMOCRATS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JAY ROOT 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Vice President Al Gore, shouting like a Southern
preacher, urged Texas Democrats on Friday to unite and defeat a
Republican ticket that is ``all sizzle and no steak.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I call on you Texas Democrats to do the hard work in the
trenches; register the voters, get that turnout and get people to
the polls,'' said Gore, who delivered the keynote speech at the
two-day state Democratic Convention, which will end Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president took credit for the booming U.S. economy,
saying that, thanks to the policies of the Clinton administration,
the unemployment rate is at its lowest level in 28 years and wage
growth has risen to its highest level in 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also delivered several sharp partisan attacks, accusing
Republicans of selling out to tobacco companies and proposing to
squander a government surplus ``on large risky and indiscriminate
tax schemes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We must reject the Republican agenda that is all sizzle and no
steak,'' Gore said. ``All show and no go. All windup and no pitch.
All hat and no cattle.''
</P>
<P>
   The vice president arrived in San Antonio Friday morning after
helping Garry Mauro, the Democratic nominee for governor, take in
an estimated $150,000 at a fund-raiser Thursday in El Paso.
</P>
<P>
   Mauro introduced Gore, calling him ``the next president of the
United States,'' and describing Texas as ``Gore country.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Vice President Gore is going to be coming back to Texas in the
year 2000,'' Mauro said. ``And when he comes back to Texas to
campaign in 2000, he's going to have a friend in the Texas
Governor's Mansion.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore is the odds-on favorite to become the Democratic nominee
for president in two years, but it is not certain that he will have
a friend in the Governor's Mansion.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush, who is running for re-election but may seek
the presidency, is running far ahead of Mauro in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   And despite support by Gore and Clinton, Mauro has found it
lonely at the top of the ticket, as many Democratic office seek to
distance themselves from him.
</P>
<P>
   John Sharp, the Democratic candidate for lieutenant governor,
has declined to endorse Mauro. And the state's top Democrat,
outgoing Lt. Gov. Bob Bullock, has thrown his support to Bush.
</P>
<P>
   One statewide candidate who had no trouble embracing Mauro is
state Rep. Richard Raymond, the Democratic nominee in the race to
replace Mauro as state land commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I support Garry Mauro and the whole Democratic ticket,'' said
Raymond, who pointed to Bush's huge lead in the polls to explain
Mauro's lack of explicit support.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure that the same people who are not overtly endorsing
Garry now would be glad to endorse him if he were up 20 points in
the polls right now,'' Raymond said.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans reacted with glee at the lack of fervor for their
top candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Texas Republican team is united and strong,'' said Matt
Mathews, director of the Republican group Victory 98. ``The
Democrats won't even say whether they'll support, campaign with or
vote for Garry Mauro.''
</P>
<P>
   Mauro spokesman Joe Cutbirth dismissed the comments.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been Democrats supporting Garry Mauro at every
rally he's been at,'' Cutbirth said. ``That kind of silly rhetoric
is what the Republicans use to get their names in the newspaper.''
</P>
<P>
   Democratic candidates speaking Friday mostly stuck to
bread-and-butter issues such as education and jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Sharp said Texas will make the oil and cotton booms of
yesteryear ``look like a barn dance'' if it makes education its top
priority.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Hobby, the Democratic candidate for state comptroller,
underscored the importance of diversity, telling delegates that
``diversity doesn't mean quotas or set-asides; it means we are
inclusive in our processes.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the candidates _ including Sharp and Hobby _ delivered
lines in Spanish, as Bush did at the GOP state convention in Fort
Worth. Gore left out the verb in his: ``Mis amigos. Familias
fuertes,'' or ``My friends. Strong families.''
</P>
<P>
   Giving the closing speech Friday, the Rev. Jesse Jackson focused
on the need to help the poor. In an interview before he addressed
delegates, Jackson said many Americans feel insecure despite a
booming economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big challenge during this period of growth, prosperity and
wealth is to leave no American behind,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   Although most of the convention has centered on partisan
politics, Gore used his visit to bring Texas some federal bacon.
</P>
<P>
   Gore announced that Texas will get a $76 million
``Welfare-to-Work'' grant, the largest any state has received, and
$6.1 million in retraining funds for employees at San Antonio's
soon-to-be closed Kelly Air Force Base.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that we have these good economic times in our nation's
economy, this is the time to fix the problems that have led to such
a high percentage of our people receiving welfare,'' Gore said.

CAMBY HAS NO EXCUSES NOW 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Canada)  (mk) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There was nothing frail in his voice _ which neither broke nor
cracked _ making Marcus Camby's first major move as a Knick injury
free.
</P>
<P>
   He survived questions about his fragile past as a Toronto Raptor
and his slip-ups on and off the court Friday in his first full day
as an official Knick. His first full day of not being Charles
Oakley.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one is going to replace Oak,'' said Camby, who on Wednesday
night was traded to the Knicks from Toronto for Oakley. ``He was
the heart and soul and a team leader. He's irreplaceable. I just
want to bring something different, a lot of versatility. I'm a guy
who can play a number of positions and give this team a different
outlook than it had in the past couple of years.''
</P>
<P>
   The difference is, there is a future to the Knicks now. If Camby
is not used in a trade to grab a point guard, he has a chance to
find inspiration from the veteran Knick players who will surround
him, and reach the star potential that is etched on his
6-foot-11-inch athletic frame. He can shoot the open jumper, rise
like a flare to block a shot and lap the rest of the plodding
Knicks in a race around the court. But there is his reputation for
being soft. All of these characteristics _ good and bad _ make him
the un-Knick.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I can fit in,'' Camby said. ``Playing physical is not
really one of my strengths, but I'm going to come here and add
something different. I think we're going to try and run this year,
make things happen and get it in the open court for some easy
baskets.''
</P>
<P>
   It sounds good, sounds fun. But Camby's flight plans will have
to revolve around Patrick Ewing, just like the rest of his
teammates. Unlike his life as a Raptor, Camby will not be a go-to
man, but a next-to-last resort when Ewing, Larry Johnson or Allan
Houston are covered.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe this new, less-pressured status is best. His two years as
a star for an expansion team seemed to hinder Camby more than help
him. Instead of rising above a difficult situation, Camby seemed to
become a product of his environment in Toronto. He was inconsistent
and prone to injury as much as the Raptors' franchise was unsettled
and dysfunctional.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was really no stability,'' said Camby, who was the
second overall pick in the 1996 draft out of Massachusetts. ``We
had to worry about trades and who was going to be gone tomorrow. I
think I'm in a stable franchise now with a lot of tradition.''
</P>
<P>
   He has a firm footing, and no excuses now. If Johnson can play
nearly an entire season on a badly sprained ankle, Camby can learn
to play in pain, too. In Toronto, Camby called in sick because of
everything from back strains to ankle sprains, from the flu to a
jammed neck. Once, the former Raptors coach Darrell Walker _ in an
attempt to force Camby to play through pain _ refused to send a
trainer to aid Camby when he was wincing on the court.
</P>
<P>
   This is as good a time as any for Camby to shake the
hypochondriac label and take a step toward maturity in his contract
year. If this 24-year-old is to succeed, he cannot afford the
missteps that have dogged his past. In college, he violated NCAA
rules after accepting cash from an agent. Last summer in
Manchester, Conn., he was arrested and charged with possession of
marijuana, a charge that was later dropped.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been through a lot of adversity in my life,'' Camby said.
``There are always going to be doubters out there, people who doubt
me as a person and as a player. My goal is to have the last laugh.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have to prove anything but to myself and to my
teammates. What people say is not going to make or break me.''
</P>
<P>
   No breaks, no cracks. Camby's first full day had a healthy glow
to it.

NETS' POTENTIAL OWNERS CONSIDER SITES IN NEWARK 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A group of New Jersey businessmen that plans to buy
the controlling interest in the Nets next week is still trying to
determine exactly where the team will play.
</P>
<P>
   The group, led by Stan Gale and Fin Wentworth of the
Gale-Wentworth Group of Florham Park, will pay $150 million to
acquire approximately 65 percent of the team in a deal that is
expected to be completed on Tuesday, the deadline for executing the
purchase option.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets' lease at the Meadowlands expires in 2030, but there
are windows to escape in 2000 and 2004. The new owners hope to move
the team to Newark as part of a plan to revitalize the city, with
2004 a more realistic date for having a new arena ready.
</P>
<P>
   The group has the support of Raymond Chambers, a New Jersey
businessman and philanthropist who is chairman of the Amelior
Foundation and was active in bringing the New Jersey Performing
Arts Center to Newark.
</P>
<P>
   The group has three sites in mind, with its top choice being on
Market Street, near the Gateway Complex. The complex, a group of
four office towers, was bought by Steven Witkoff and the Witkoff
Group earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   An arena there would help extend the Newark revitalization
project out from the center of the city, along the Passaic River.
The arena would anchor the south end of the area and a minor league
baseball stadium would be be on the north end, with the Performing
Arts Center already in place in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   But while the Gale-Wentworth group envisions a move to Newark,
leaving the vacant arena to serve either as a conference center or
a retail shopping center, the New Jersey Sports and Exposition
Authority has not ruled out improving the Meadowlands' appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Underlying all of this quietly is a move afoot to renovate the
Meadowlands property,'' said an official involved in the Newark
dealings. ``Being what's going on with other sites, it has become
clear that the Meadowlands needs to make the property more
attractive.''
</P>
<P>
   The official said the Giants might be looking to finance a
solution that could include a retail mall at the complex.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might have the bells and whistles for public use that would
be available for the ticket holders,'' the official said.
``Literally adjacent to the arena, there would be stores, hotels, a
bowling alley, movie theaters, and all of it open to tickets
holders and also to the public. Now the Meadowlands would start to
be attractive again.''
</P>

PALMER, WALKING, SHOOTS 75 ON BLISTERING DAY
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By GERALD ESKENAZI    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   CLIFTON, N.J. _ It's the game, and you have to honor it, no
matter how tired you are, no matter what the temperature, Arnold
Palmer suggested Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Worst irons I ever hit in my life,'' he said after making a
bogey at the 12th hole of the Cadillac NFL Golf Classic Friday. ``I
can't even get the club face on them.'' But he said it so softly,
only a few people heard him. The game, after all, must be honored.
A bad hit merits a slight shake of the head. Nothing more.
</P>
<P>
   He was the oldest man on the course at the age of 68 but, except
for several short excursions in a cart, he walked the entire way as
the temperature hit 97 degrees and the humidity made it feel like
110. He realized that many in the crowd had come to see him and
wanted to see him walking, not sitting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I walk for a number of reasons,'' Palmer said. ``To stay in
shape. And mostly, it's a part of the game. People need that. Too
many players are out here saying, `I've got to do this.' But this
is a special game. There is no game in the world like this. When
you hit a bad shot, you can't get mad at anyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   By the fifth hole, in another grouping, the 60-year-old Charles
Coody had had enough of walking in the heat. Although he would end
up leading after Friday's opening round of this Senior Tour event,
which included National Football League players, he grew tired and
hopped into his cart. Who could blame him? Everyone was sweating
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer was in a good mood, though, at least on the back nine,
which he toured in 35. His drives were smashed 270 yards, nestling
into the fairways, and his irons, which troubled him earlier,
finally reacted as he wanted. He shot a three-over-par 75, leaving
him nine behind Coody and eight behind Bruce Crampton, the
defending champion, and Dave Stockton.
</P>
<P>
   When the round ended, Palmer went to the driving range and began
pelting balls. ``He's in a good mood now,'' said his friend, and
longtime dentist, Howdy Giles. ``He's really hitting the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Tom Wargo, one of his playing partners, was paying homage
to Palmer. Wargo was dressed nattily in an Arnold Palmer plantation
hat. He played Arnold Palmer clubs, as well.
</P>
<P>
   By No. 18, Palmer was feeling pretty good. He had made a couple
of birdies on the back nine and now he was set to drive on the
finale, a par-5. His other partner was Jim Harbaugh, the Baltimore
Ravens quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you hit it in two, I'll buy you a beer,'' Palmer said as
Wargo was set to tee off. Palmer outdrove his playing partners, as
he had throughout the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go for it, Arnie!'' someone shouted in a plea from the 1950s
as his drive left him 320 yards from the hole, which measures 590
yards.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer acknowledged the ovation that he hears at every golf
tournament as he approached No. 18 in three. He sank the birdie
putt, and heard more ahs than oohs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I beat Wargo for a couple of beers on that last hole,'' said
Palmer, finally getting into a cart that was surrounded by
children, teen-agers and adults. ``That made my day.'' &QL;

OFFICER CONVICTED OF SEXUALLY ABUSING WOMAN IN CUSTODY 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By KIT R. ROANE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A city police officer was convicted Friday of
sexually abusing a 35-year-old woman who had been taken to the 79th
Precinct station house in Brooklyn after a fight with her husband.
</P>
<P>
   Officer Benjamin Rodriguez, 26, of Suffolk County was found
guilty of four misdemeanor counts of sexual abuse after a trial
before state Supreme Court Justice James Starkey, said Brooklyn
District Attorney Charles Hynes.
</P>
<P>
   Hynes said the officer had ``betrayed his badge and disgraced
himself.'' Rodriguez faces up to 90 days in jail when he is
sentenced Aug. 12.
</P>
<P>
   The officer was acquitted of more serious felony charges of
sodomy and sexual abuse. His lawyer, Neil Cohen, said Rodriguez
continued to ``maintain his innocence,'' despite his decision to
resign from the police force.
</P>
<P>
   The abuse occurred in December 1996, after Rodriguez responded
to a disturbance at the woman's home, police said. Investigators
said she was taken into custody and charged with assault when her
husband said she threw an object at him during a fight.
</P>
<P>
   The woman, who had apparently been distraught at the recent
death of her sister, was taken to the 79th Precinct station house
in Bedford-Stuyvesant, where Rodriguez began to check whether she
had any outstanding warrants, police said.
</P>
<P>
   At several points during this routine procedure, Rodriguez
groped the woman, moving her to a different portion of the station
house every time he was interrupted by noise or the presence of
other officers, investigators said. After the booking was
completed, they said, he gave the woman his beeper number and urged
her to call him. The woman's assault charge was later dismissed,
the district attorney's office said.
</P>
<P>
   The department's Internal Affairs Bureau began to look into
Rodriguez's behavior after an officer who had witnessed some of the
suspicious activity reported it, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The woman, whose name was withheld by the district attorney's
office because of the nature of the crime, is suing the city, the
Police Department, police officials and Rodriguez for $171 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time my client closes her eyes, she relives a
nightmare,'' her lawyer, Peter Bongiorno, said. ``The fact that
this was perpetrated by a police officer, employed to protect
citizens, shocks the conscience. And the fact that it occurred in a
station house should spark an extensive investigation into police
procedures regarding the supervision of officers.''

EDITORIAL: REPORT CARD ON RUDY CREW 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Th New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, June 27:
</P>
<P>
   New York City school bells rang at noon Friday, tolling a
two-month summer break for the 1.1 million students in what is not
only the country's largest public school system but also one of its
sorriest.
</P>
<P>
   As Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew moves into his third year on the
job, this is still a system with an old physical plant and an
ungainly bureaucracy. Yet it is time to recognize a few green
shoots of hope in what has too long been a field of failure.
</P>
<P>
   Test scores are up, and while the improvement was so slight at
some schools that it could take years for students to perform at
grade level, the scores for both reading and math are moving in the
right direction. That is encouraging because the hurdles are going
to get higher. By 2001, students will confront tough new exams in
order to graduate. Crew has also announced plans to phase out
``social promotions,'' sending those who fail to summer remedial
care.
</P>
<P>
   The state Board of Regents is also thinking of more rigorous
qualifications for new teachers and teaching colleges. The Regents
want to add ``incompetence'' to the list of reasons a teacher can
be dismissed. The list of disappointments, however, is still long.
Shabby facilities are a scandal. The voters' rejection of a school
bond issue last fall, Gov. George Pataki's veto of $200 million in
repair funds this spring and a long history of incompetence at the
School Construction Authority have left most city schools horror
stories to tell.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the school population booms with many new students
from immigrant families. Educators are also quietly frantic about
where they will house the 14,000 new pre-kindergarten students
added to the rolls next fall. Finding enough talented educators is
a constant concern. Crew tried hard to persuade Albany to remove
tenure protections from principals, but he sidestepped the hard
issue of removing untenured principals from some of the city's
least productive schools.
</P>
<P>
   Given the talent shortage, the departure for San Diego of
Anthony Alvarado, superintendent of lower Manhattan's District 2,
was a painful loss to the city and the chancellor, even though he
was sometimes at odds with the independent-minded Alvarado.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Crew seems to be winning control over this unwieldy
system and has asked for a new contract to let him finish out his
term in 2001. So far that looks like a good bet, especially if the
chancellor continues to tackle the big problems that have made it
difficult to provide sound teaching in safe buildings.

 By MIRTA OJITO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Many Americans have never heard of her, yet she has a
nonstop schedule of sold-out concerts, a Grammy on a shelf in her
New Jersey home and a street named after her in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   She speaks little English, but she has an honorary degree from
Yale, a star on Hollywood Boulevard and a medal from the National
Endowment for the Arts. One of her dresses and a pair of shoes are
part of the Smithsonian's permanent collection.
</P>
<P>
   She is Celia Cruz, the Cuban-born salsa singer whose inventive
improvisation, intoxicating rhythms and trademark shrieks of
``azucar!'' (sugar) have enchanted fans for half a century.
</P>
<P>
   In an era of crossover pop stars and the relentless
Americanization of almost everything, Ms. Cruz, who plays Carnegie
Hall on Saturday night with Tito Puente, is an oddity. She has seen
her popularity in this country grow even as she has clung
resolutely to her roots, her language and her style.
</P>
<P>
   While she still performs throughout Latin America, where she
remains hugely popular 38 years after leaving Cuba, Ms. Cruz has
added cities from Bethlehem, Pa., to Portland, Ore., to her
American itinerary.
</P>
<P>
   Her widening success in the United States reflects not just her
prodigious talent and seemingly ageless voice, but the impact of
unprecedented waves of migration from Latin America in the last 20
years.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cruz, who refuses to reveal her age, did not have to cross
over to gain a wider audience; her audience has followed her here.
</P>
<P>
   When she came to New York in 1961, Ms. Cruz recalled during a
recent lunch, she was immediately embraced by the Puerto Rican
community that was already well established here. ``They said to
me, `Celia, take our flag,''' she said. `` `You can use it until
you get yours back.'''
</P>
<P>
   As the years went by, her audiences grew more diverse, one
immigration wave after the other. Now, she said, ``the Puerto
Ricans are still there, but I'm also finding Dominicans,
Colombians, Mexicans and even Argentines.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cruz, who sings only in Spanish and wears form-fitting gowns
and extravagant wigs that seem to belong to another era, has never
attempted to cultivate a non-Hispanic audience, as her younger
countrywoman Gloria Estefan has done with great success.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why embarrass myself?'' she said, without a tinge of false
modesty. ``I don't speak English well. Why even venture?''
</P>
<P>
   But her following in the United States has clearly grown beyond
the traditional immigrant centers in New York, Miami, and
California. In Bethlehem, for example, where she will perform for
the first time this year, the Hispanic population has nearly
doubled since 1980, to more than 11,000, according to census
figures. Portland, where she sang for the first time last year, has
more than 17,000 Hispanic residents, up from 7,500 in the 1980
census.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing you can be sure of, she wouldn't be invited if there
wasn't an audience already in place,'' said Jack Hooke, her agent
and a friend for more than 30 years. ``The people who put these
shows together spend a lot on money, and they don't like to waste
it. They know she sells.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike trendy artists who have a hit record and then disappear
until the next hit, Ms. Cruz sells records and concert tickets all
the time, record shop owners say. More than a singer, they say, she
is a cultural icon. ``She is the queen of salsa,'' said Vicente
Barreiro, the owner of Casa Latina, a record store in East Harlem.
``Everybody buys Celia Cruz. And this being New York, everybody is
here.''
</P>
<P>
   The more recent immigrants, who tend to be younger, attend her
concerts buoyed by their own interest in her music but also by
curiosity over a woman whose music their parents and grandparents
danced to back in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   During lunch at Patria, a Manhattan restaurant staffed by
waiters and busboys from all over Latin America, Ms. Cruz was
mobbed by requests for autographs and pictures the moment she
indicated that her meal (filet mignon over white rice) was over.
</P>
<P>
   Javier Osorio, 26, a busboy from Mexico who has lived in New
York for 11 years, was one of the first to approach. He walked away
almost dizzy with delight, with Ms. Cruz's autograph and a picture
of her in his camera. Osorio said that he had seen Ms. Cruz in
concert twice, but that the autograph and photo were for his
mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother used to follow her around and dance to her music in
all the hot clubs of the 1950s,'' he said. ``She remembers the
Celia of her youth.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cruz, who travels constantly not just throughout the
Americas but in Europe and Japan as well, began her journey in
Cuba, where she grew up in a poor family; her father was a railroad
stoker and her mother a homemaker.
</P>
<P>
   Young Celia often sang her younger siblings to sleep, and a
cousin _ noting that her voice attracted awestruck neighbors to
their home in the Santos Suarez neighborhood of Havana _ encouraged
her to compete in radio contests. When a tourist bought her a pair
of shoes one day after hearing her belt out a song, Ms. Cruz
realized that her talent might pay her way through school so she
could become a teacher.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, she began singing full time with Cuba's most popular
orchestra, La Sonora Matancera, in 1950. On one endless bus tour
after another, through big cities and small towns, Ms. Cruz began
to cultivate her international public. Some seasons, she said, she
gave five performances a day, every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``But my voice never gave out,'' she said. ``The more I sing,
the better I get.''
</P>
<P>
   A year after Fidel Castro seized power in 1959, Ms. Cruz, who
was touring Mexico, decided she would not return to Cuba. She
settled in New York in 1961, renting an apartment on Manhattan's
Upper West Side. She now lives in a town house in Fort Lee, N.J.,
surrounded by woods.
</P>
<P>
   Off stage, Ms. Cruz is approachable but private. She would not
allow a reporter to visit her at home. Instead, she brought her
husband and inseparable partner, Pedro Knight, to the lunch.
</P>
<P>
   Knight was a trumpet player with La Sonora Matancera who gave up
his career to manage hers and follow her around the world. Next
month they will celebrate their 36th wedding anniversary. The two
remain touchingly close. She frets about his diet _ he has
diabetes. He taught her to cook and says that, without her, he
would not want to live. She washes his shirts by hand and hangs
them out to dry in the hotels where they stay on tour.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   When they are not traveling, they stay home most of the time,
watching television and reading magazines. Ms. Cruz answers her own
telephone and talks to people as if she has always known them _
using endearing Cuban phrases with instant familiarity.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's interesting about Celia Cruz is that she does not seem
to realize that she is a star,'' said Alexis Rodriguez-Duarte, a
photographer who has taken her portrait. ``She is the same on and
off stage.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez-Duarte met Ms. Cruz in 1989 when, while living in
London, he noticed a poster announcing one of her concerts. Through
a friend of a friend, he found out where Ms. Cruz was staying and,
on an impulse, called her.
</P>
<P>
   ``She answered the telephone herself and I just said, `Hi, I'm a
Cuban from Miami and I love your music and would like to meet you,'
and she said, `Come over, and we'll have coffee,'''
Rodriguez-Duarte recalled. ``And I remember thinking, `What a nice
lady, but who is going to go to her concert in London?'''
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, he said, the concert was sold out. The two
have been friends since.
</P>
<P>
   Despite her lack of interest in courting the crossover market,
Ms. Cruz's ever-expanding audience and the interest shown by
American performers in her music may be raising her profile among
the non-Hispanic public. She has sung with David Byrne and Patti
LaBelle, had roles in two Hollywood films, ``The Mambo Kings'' and
``The Perez Family,'' and has even appeared on ``Sesame Street.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People who did not know me before are beginning to recognize
me,'' Ms. Cruz said. ``I see them in the airport or in the planes
sometimes. And I know they are thinking, `Is she or is she not?'''
</P>
<P>
   Her name and face may sooner become even more familiar. In the
fall, she will come out with a line of products that bear her
ornate signature and a singing doll that imitates her trademark
cry.
</P>
<P>
   Some things, it seems, simply cannot be translated. ``
`Sugar','' she said, using the English word, ``just does not have
the same flavor as one of my `azucar!'''

   For good or ill, England carries the day
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By JOHN P. LOPEZ &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
LENS, France _ It was England 2, Colombia 0 in regulation time
Friday. Which means the French police must continue to work
overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Amid thundering support from its legion of fans, who were
raucous but well-behaved inside Stade Felix Bollaert, England
played near-perfect soccer on the way to the easy victory, a
second-place finish in Group G and a berth in the second round of
the World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   The thorough whipping, which came thanks to the terrific play of
youngsters David Beckham, Darren Anderton and Michael Owen, was
good news for the English, who advance to face nemesis Argentina on
Tuesday in Saint-Etienne.
</P>
<P>
   But for the French security forces, who continued to scuffle
with bands of English hooligans outside the stadium before, during
and after the game, England's presence for at least four more days
probably was met with apprehension.
</P>
<P>
   Still, England deserved and earned this berth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we could have scored four or five goals tonight if we
would have taken a few more risks,'' England coach Glenn Hoddle
said. ``I was extremely pleased.''
</P>
<P>
   Extremely pleased only began to describe the sentiment of the
huge throng of English fans who found tickets, squeezed into Stade
Felix Bollaert and saw the all-around English game at its best.
</P>
<P>
   After Anderton rocketed the first goal just inside the near post
from 10 yards out in the 20th minute, the chanting, flag-waving and
singing began.
</P>
<P>
   Ten minutes later when Beckham curved a free kick over the
Colombian wall and into the net from 25 yards away, a full-fledged
party broke out, with streamers sailing to the field from the
grandstands, a group of English fans doing the conga around the
stadium and noise reaching deafening levels.
</P>
<P>
   A few English fans climbed the restraining fence that encircled
the stadium, and others stood on railings in the second-level
terrace but were quickly restrained by security personnel.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, as tense and unsettling as things were outside the
stadium throughout the night, where more than 1,200 police officers
struggled with various groups of drunken, bottle-throwing
hooligans, the English team and its fans were calm and in control
inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always felt in control of the game,'' Anderton said. ``It's
great to be moving on.''
</P>
<P>
   It never was in doubt.
</P>
<P>
   Colombia controlled possession, especially in the first half,
but holding the ball only proved to be a farce. The Colombians
rarely finished buildups against the English defense and never had
a legitimate scoring chance.
</P>
<P>
   England, on the other hand, worked its long-ball offense to
perfection, with Owen, the speedy 18-year-old striker starting his
first World Cup game, starting numerous attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Owen had a pair of wide-open chances to increase the lead in the
second half, but both were stopped by Colombian goalie Farid
Mondragon, who on this night was the best and busiest Colombian
player on the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pleased with the way Michael played, but I'm pleased with
everybody tonight,'' Hoddle said. ``I knew we were ready to go, and
after I saw how we started the game, I knew the result would be a
good one. They didn't cause us a lot of problems, and we were able
to play our game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tactically, we got it right tonight. I couldn't believe all
the chances we created for ourselves. We're on our way, but let's
not get carried away. We've got a long way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what the French police must be saying, too.

REPORT OUTLINES DAMAGE TO NATIONAL SECURITY IN COMPANIES' CHINA
DEALINGS 
</HEADLINE>
  (EXCLUSIVE; 10:45 p.m. ET EMBARGO for print media; 12:01 a.m. ET
EMBARGO for electronic media.) 
 (HLW)  
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When two American satellite makers shared technical
information with Chinese rocket scientists, they committed three
major security breaches, according to a confidential assessment by
the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon had already determined that the two companies,
Loral Space &AMP; Communications and Hughes Electronics, did some harm
to the national security of the United States when they helped
China find the cause of a failed rocket launch in February 1996.
The Chinese rocket, which was carrying a Loral satellite, exploded
22 seconds after lift-off.
</P>
<P>
   But in newly revealed portions of a report, authorities
described with more precision the degree of damage and the nature
of the violations by the companies. The report is significant
because its findings triggered a Justice Department criminal
inquiry into the two aerospace companies, which in turn became a
central focus of a multi-pronged congressional investigation into
whether China illicitly obtained sensitive American technology.
</P>
<P>
   Portions of the 20-page report by the Defense Technology
Security Administration, a Pentagon agency responsible for
safeguarding American technology exports, were read to The New York
Times. The report categorized the violations in three degrees of
seriousness, a person familiar with the report said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the May 16, 1997, report, there were three
``major'' breaches that ``undeniably'' would have been deleted by
the Pentagon had military authorities been given the opportunity to
screen the material before it was given to the Chinese. In any
case, officials say they believe the companies gave China data that
required a State Department license.
</P>
<P>
   A senior administration official said on Friday that the
breaches involved the companies' volunteering alternative causes
for the accident that could help China improve its rocket
technology.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, there were three ``medium'' violations, which
``most likely'' would have been deleted by the State Department,
and 12 ``minor'' infractions that ``probably'' would have been
denied to the Chinese, said the person who has read the document.
</P>
<P>
   All of the infractions involved assistance the American
technical experts gave the Chinese to help solve problems with
their rockets' guidance and control systems, an area of weakness in
China's missile programs.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials have refused to discuss the report's
findings at the insistence of the Justice Department, which is
conducting a criminal inquiry into Loral and Hughes. Justice
officials fear that revealing the conclusions could undermine their
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   On one level, the investigation focuses on whether the American
companies, which were part of an industry commission established
for insurance purposes to investigate the explosion, gave China
data that required a State Department license. On a broader level,
though, the issue is whether the American experts conveyed
technical information that the Chinese could also apply to their
military ballistic missiles.
</P>
<P>
   The rockets the Chinese use to launch satellites are very
similar to the Chinese missiles that carry nuclear warheads.
American policymakers are concerned that any information that
improves the reliability of the commercial launches could do the
same for military missiles.
</P>
<P>
   The Times had previously reported that the American experts
determined that the February 1996 accident was caused by a flaw in
the electronic flight control system. One of the ``major'' breaches
of information, the Pentagon report found, was that the companies
volunteered alternative causes for the failed unit that the Chinese
had not concluded on their own.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials, including those from the Central
Intelligence Agency, have played down this violation, arguing that
the failed component, while integral to commercial rockets'
guidance systems, is not used in any ballistic missile that the
Chinese have now or plan to field in the future.
</P>
<P>
   A more troubling ``major'' violation, a senior administration
official said, was the companies' suggestion that the Chinese use
diagnostic techniques that would allow Beijing's engineers to
detect flaws in guidance systems for any kind of missile, including
those carrying nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``The significant benefits derived by China from these
activities are likely to lead to improvements in the overall
reliability of their space-launched vehicles and ballistic
missiles, and, in particular, their guidance systems,'' the report
says, according to the person who has read it.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The larger issue centers on what happened after the Chinese Long
March missile blew up on Feb. 15, 1996, destroying a $200 million
Loral communications satellite.
</P>
<P>
   International insurers insisted that China have an outside
review panel examine the cause of the accident. Loral headed the
industry team, which included experts from Hughes.
</P>
<P>
   The industry commission then gave its findings to the Chinese
without prior approval from the United States government. Loral
executives acknowledge this happened, but insist no sensitive
information was divulged.
</P>
<P>
   When the State Department learned of the information shared with
the Chinese, it asked four federal agencies with expertise in
rocket technology or missile proliferation to review the industry
commission's report.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department's own intelligence arm and the Air Force's
National Air Intelligence Center shared the Pentagon technology
office's conclusions that national security had been harmed. The
CIA, which only considered the impact on the spread of missiles
around the world, found that the crash did not raise concerns in
that area.
</P>
<P>
   But in the past week, the director of central intelligence,
George Tenet, ordered his agency to assess the incident for
national-security damages just as the other agencies had. The new
CIA report is expected to be completed in the next few weeks, an
administration official said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon report has attracted wide attention on Capitol
Hill, mainly because the Defense Technology Security
Administration, which prepared the report, draws on the expertise
of the nation's top rocket scientists.
</P>
<P>
   ``The DTSA report is very serious, and one we'll have to look at
very carefully,'' said Rep. Norm Dicks, D-Wash., the senior
Democrat on the House Select Committee looking into the China
accusations.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the Select Committee, Rep. Christopher Cox,
R-Calif., has said the satellite makers' information-sharing will
be the panel's first order of business this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to make sure that we remain focused, so that we can
answer at least this threshold question before us,'' Cox said this
week.

PIECES OF ADVICE FOR AN AILING JAPAN, COMPLIMENTS OF AMERICA  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 28) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   (italics)Back in the 1980s, Japan was full of advice for the
United States: Clean up the federal deficit, a drag on the world
economy. End your addiction to credit cards. Try a little lean
production in Detroit. Adopt Japan's strict gun-control laws. Make
sure every student can read. Make workers feel as though they are
part of the company, not just hired help. Oh, and run a bullet
train between Boston and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Most of these ideas were pretty good, even if Americans bristled
at being given a lecture by the new titan of the world economy.
</P>
<P>
   But now an economic reckoning has come to Japan, and it seems
only fair to return the favor with a few modest suggestions from
America that might help revive the ailing giant of Asia.(end
italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Give the Yankees A New Home: Osaka &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's not as crazy as it sounds. George Steinbrenner wants a new
stadium, but New York taxpayers can think of better things to do
with their money. Japan, on the other hand, has just appropriated
trillions of yen for public works to bolster the economy _ and is
having a hard time coming up with something interesting to spend it
on.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a more serious reason for moving the House That
Ruth Built to the country that the Babe wowed during a 1934 tour.
Japanese baseball has become a symbol of what's wrong with the
Japanese economy: precisely controlled competition. Each team is
limited to two foreign players, to keep the game from losing its
distinctive Japanese flavor. Corporate Japan doesn't have the
two-player rule, but it acts as though it does.
</P>
<P>
   If the Yankees move to Japan's industrial heart, the closed
market of Japanese baseball will be forever opened. Suddenly, teams
around Japan will have to compete for the best global players they
can find. Japanese fans will watch more home runs blasted out of
the park. And the teams that can't stand the heat _ well, they may
be busted to the minor leagues. That's capitalism.
</P>
<P>
   Some other benefits: Steinbrenner becomes some other city's
problem. Hideki Irabu, Japan's greatest export in recent years,
might feel more at home _ the rest of the team will require
simultaneous translation. And if you are a Red Sox fan, tired of
looking up at the Yankees in the American League standings, it's a
win-win situation _ all in the name of helping a great ally out of
a tight spot. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Swap Cabbies With New York &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For years, Japan and the United States have organized reciprocal
visits by lawmakers. The Americans arrive in Tokyo, enjoy kaiseki
feasts at the finest restaurants, hold news conferences to complain
about trade barriers (``Good progress, but there's a lot of work to
be done'') and fly home without having changed anyone's mind in
Japan.
</P>
<P>
   A few months later, leaders of the Japanese Diet arrive in
Washington, chain-smoke through endless meals at the Watergate
Hotel and go home convinced that the Americans will never
understand them.
</P>
<P>
   To really alter attitudes, how about trading taxi drivers
instead? Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York would love it:
Tokyo's cabbies wear white gloves, keep their cars pristine and
navigate seamlessly through one of the world's most complicated
cities.
</P>
<P>
   But the real benefit would go to Japan. After decades of
``internationalization,'' the country is still far from what you
might call a melting pot. Immigration is, um, frowned upon. And
while this attitude creates a more cohesive society, it deprives
Japan of the energy and entrepreneurship that populates labs in
Silicon Valley _ and driver's seats in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Without flying anywhere, Japanse citizens could get a crash
course in multiculturalism. No doubt, there would be some culture
clash when an inebriated Japanese salaryman gets into a cab in the
downtown Ginza district at midnight and tries to give directions to
his house in Yokohama to a new arrival with minimal Japanese
language skills. But it would globalize Japan real fast. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Invite Gates-san To Endow a Chair &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the 80s, Japanese companies couldn't spend enough money on
American campuses. They endowed chairs at Harvard and MIT, and paid
for research projects at Stanford. The donations improved their
image in the United States and gave the Japanese a window into the
breeding grounds for some of America's most innovative
technologies.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Japanese universities, meanwhile, were starving. They got little
support from Japanese businesses, which would rather train
researchers themselves.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 90s, the president of one of Japan's leading
research universities said, appeals for money for modern
laboratories were regularly turned down by Japanese executives.
</P>
<P>
   Now it is time for Japanese schools to solicit help from Silicon
Valley. For example, they could establish the William H. Gates
chair to infuse risk-averse Japanese students with a little
Microsoft mythology.
</P>
<P>
   In return for endowing the chairs, American companies would be
offered the first crack at hiring Japan's best and brightest,
before they disappeared into the bowels of Hitachi and Toshiba. And
there's one more advantage for Gates: The Japanese are not known
for breaking up monopolies. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   How About Trying Credit Card Debt? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What do Americans have in abundance that we would be happy to
share? All those letters from credit card companies declaring that
we've just been pre-approved for a card we never requested. Why not
take them off our hands?
</P>
<P>
   Japan is suffering a credit crunch that is killing the economy.
In the 80s and early 90s, banks lent money to anyone who walked in
the door. They felt flush because real estate prices were sky high
_ and real estate on a crowded island never goes down, right? _ and
because banks in Japan were (and still are) allowed to count stock
holdings as part of their capital. Every jump in stock prices meant
that the banks could lend even more.
</P>
<P>
   Then the triple whammy hit. Land prices crashed. So did the
stock market. And then many of the banks' borrowers _ small
businesses, gangsters, property developers _ announced that they
couldn't pay. So now, saddled with $600 billion in bad debts, the
banks simply won't lend. Sure, interest rates are ridiculously low,
but try getting a loan.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, no new credit means little new business activity,
which sends the stock market lower, which pushes the banks even
closer to the brink.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese government promised last week to get serious about
cleaning up the banking mess, but it has said that before. In the
meantime, Japan needs credit. Lots of it. Take that junk mail _
please. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Scrap the Yen. Spend Tamagotchi. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The big problem in Japan these days is that no one is spending
any money. Ordinary folks don't trust the banks, so they are
stuffing cash under the futon. Whenever they are tempted to buy
something, the government warns that the population is aging
quickly, so people have to save, save, save for retirement.
</P>
<P>
   The solution lies in Japanese technology: the tamagotchi, that
annoying little electronic chicken that needs to be fed, stroked
and cared for every few hours or it dies. For a few years now, it
has driven parents in Japan _ and then in America _ to distraction,
as their children weep over the loss of the E-chick.
</P>
<P>
   How about harnessing the invention to a greater purpose? Tuck a
tamagotchi chip into every 10,000-yen bill. If it sits in a dark
pocket without changing hands for more than a day, it turns to
dust. But pass it around _ buy a computer, spend an evening in a
karaoke bar _ and it chirps with contentment. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sell an Island To the Taiwanese &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When Japan was booming, it spread its wealth. The rich and the
not-quite-rich bought condominiums in Honolulu and Maui. They
flocked to Guam and to Port Douglas, the Australian resort village
near the Great Barrier Reef. Local shops responded, posting signs
in Japanese and hiring Japanese speakers to serve their new
patrons.
</P>
<P>
   Some locals complained at the time about the influx, but these
days Hawaiians and Australians alike talk wistfully about the days
when 747s landed every hour, full of Japanese travelers eager to
snap up souvenirs and real estate.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the yen melting down, the dollar reigning supreme and
Japanese property prices collapsing, Japan can reverse the tide.
This is the best moment in 30 years for Japan to lure investors
from abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Hokkaido would be a good place to start. Japan's northernmost
island is beautiful, thinly populated and home to Japan's best ski
slopes. Why not build spectacular ski chalets to suit the tastes of
wealthy Taiwanese, who have no place to ski on their hot, flat
island? It would create jobs in one of Japan's most depressed
corners.
</P>
<P>
   Politically savvy developers could also market the chalets as a
hedge against a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, especially if America's
military commitments to the island prove a bit iffy.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   There is no reason to stop at Hokkaido. Why not get cities
across Japan into a bidding war to attract the Big Three to buy or
build car factories, the way Tennessee, Ohio and Kentucky vied for
Nissan, Honda and Toyota? Time to roll out those tax breaks.
</P>
<P>
   After all, according to Nicholas R. Lardy, a scholar at the
Brookings Institution, there has been more foreign direct
investment in China in the last few years than there has been in
Japan since the end of World War II. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Borrow a Chapter From Al and T. Boone &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So maybe Albert J. Dunlap, lately downsized before he could get
around to dismissing still more employees at the Sunbeam Corp.,
isn't exactly a poster child for American-style capitalism.
</P>
<P>
   But if ever there was a country that needs to learn the meaning
of the term ``shareholder value,'' it is Japan. So a touch of Chain
Saw Al's approach _ getting companies into fighting trim _ might do
wonders at bloated concerns like Japan Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese are not likely to warm up to some of Chain Saw Al's
ideas any more readily than Americans have, but they just might
develop a new appreciation of the need to produce profits and
returns for shareholders. After all, the old Japanese commitment to
lifetime employment is breaking down anyway, and Japan's jobless
rate, now more than 4 percent, rivals America's.
</P>
<P>
   And what about bringing back T. Boone Pickens? The
self-promoting Texas oilman made a splash in Japan in the early
1990s when he took a big stake in a Japanese car-parts
manufacturer, and then had the nerve to show up at shareholder
meetings and ask embarrassing questions about how the company was
run.
</P>
<P>
   It was quite a show. First he was booed. Then he was accused of
acting as a front for a Japanese shakedown artist. Finally he was
bought out.
</P>
<P>
   Pickens was probably ahead of his time. Now some Japanese
realize that the ingrown system he was challenging _ the Japanese
keiretsu system, in which companies hold stakes in one another but
also hide one another's weaknesses _ allows managers to run amok.
</P>
<P>
   There is a nascent movement to let investors actually learn
something about how their companies are run, as long as they don't
get too nosy. So how about sending a delegation from the Keidanren,
Japan's biggest business organization, to tell Pickens that all is
forgiven? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Take Homespun Hints From Beardstown &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Japanese women have always been among the country's most active
investors. With husbands working all day, the securities houses
used to hunt for customers by setting up shop in department stores.
But the days of watching the cash pour in are long, long gone.
</P>
<P>
   How about calling in the Beardstown Ladies, the grandmotherly
stock sharks of rural Illinois? Nothing sells better in Japan than
products that sniff of down-home American culture: blue jeans,
Elvis, New England quilts.
</P>
<P>
   So the ladies can push their no-nonsense,
look-for-long-term-value brand of stock-picking. It shouldn't be
hard to beat Nomura Securities, the Japanese brokerage giant, given
its track record for the last seven years.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the ladies' reputation was tainted a touch recently,
when it was determined that they had inflated their returns by
counting their monthly dues as profits. They say it was an innocent
mistake. But even this can be spun to advantage. The ladies can
argue that they were simply getting accustomed to Japanese
accounting standards. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Call In Your Pals From the CIA &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Forty years ago, when the greatest threat facing Japan and
America was communism, the Central Intelligence Agency secretly
funneled millions of dollars to support the conservative party that
has dominated Japan for four decades _ the ill-named Liberal
Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   This was one of the agency's few covert operations that worked
(italics)too(end italics) well. The party's politicians who were
begging the agency for money in the 50s told American trade
negotiators to take a hike in the 80s. And Japan's opposition
parties, fragmented and disorganized, have not been able to spur
any real political debate in Japan over how to manage the economy.
</P>
<P>
   So how about re-invigorating the huge CIA station inside the
American Embassy in Tokyo? Call it Operation Rising Yen. The spooks
could bombard Japanese voters with propaganda promoting Treasury
Secretary Robert E. Rubin's vision of a Japan that throws itself
open to competition, spurs the economy without inflating the trade
deficit and solves its banking crisis. They could plant guests on
the Sunday morning talk shows, advocating radical ideas like
actually closing institutions that are bankrupt.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, it's meddling in another country's politics, but that has
rarely stopped the agency before. And if Congress won't pay for it,
maybe the Chinese will. After all, they suddenly seem interested in
contributing to political causes abroad _ and they have as much to
lose as America does if Japan buckles.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Create the Sequel `Godzilla vs. MOF' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ever since Japan turned out its 1954 classic ``Godzilla, King of
the Monsters,'' the world's favorite destroyer of cities has
symbolized the various threats facing the country. The first
Godzilla movie was a protest against American nuclear tests in the
Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, Godzilla's struggles with King Kong were a
stand-in for the cold-war battles between the United States and the
Soviet Union, with Japan caught in the crossfire. The latest movie,
written by Americans for the Japanese-owned Sony studios, sends the
monster rampaging through Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   Many Japanese people now believe the country's biggest threat
comes from within _ specifically, from the Ministry of Finance.
After all, its powerful bureaucracy forced a misconceived tax
increase last year _ raising the country's consumption tax from 3
percent to 5 percent _ which many now blame for plunging the
country into recession.
</P>
<P>
   Its top leaders enjoyed long, expensive nights at ``hostess
bars'' with the financial executives it was supposed to be
regulating, one reason the country now finds itself in dire
straits. And it is MOF, as the ministry is known, that has dragged
its feet in closing down failed banks and deregulating the
financial markets.
</P>
<P>
   Many in Japan have called for the breakup of the ministry. But
taking on the most powerful bureaucrats in Tokyo is no job for mere
mortals.
</P>
<P>
   So in the spirit of those anti-nuclear protests of the 50s,
Godzilla's powerful tail and fiery breath could be turned on the
ministry's impregnable headquarters in downtown Tokyo. It's unclear
whether he could persuade the bureaucrats to take some painful
steps to get the economy moving again. But it might be fun to watch
him try.

   AT&AMP;T in Deal for TCI &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In a merger that is expected to change the way consumers buy and
use communications services, AT&AMP;T agreed to acquire
Tele-Communications Inc., the No. 2 cable television provider, for
$31.8 billion in stock.
</P>
<P>
   C. Michael Armstrong, chairman and chief executive of AT&AMP;T, and
John C. Malone, chairman of TCI, said they wanted to market the
companies' services jointly as soon as possible, selling digital
phone and data services over the cable system. ... The European
Union approved Worldcom's &UR;  &LR; $43.7 billion deal for MCI, and American
regulators are expected to back it soon.
</P>

   To win European approval, MCI agreed to sell its Internet

   Shares of Microsoft soared 5.15 percent on Tuesday after a
federal appeals court overturned a lower court's order against the
company, undercutting the government's central argument in its
antitrust suit. The stock ended the week at $104.4375.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling allows Microsoft to sell its computer operating
software with its Internet browsing feature. Windows 98 officially
went on sale last week, and even though Microsoft did not give the
new operating system software the same hype and publicity it used
to promote Windows 95 three years ago, the new version was snapped

   With few signs that the strikes and layoffs now crippling
General Motors would be settled soon, the United Automobile Workers
union raised the prospect that its walkout could last into

   The company called the strikes illegal and said it would seek to
take the UAW to speedy arbitration. Some 147,900 production workers
have been idled, and the economic effects of the shutdowns have
been slowly rippling across North America, hurting both big
suppliers like ITT &UR;  &LR; and businesses as small as workers' favorite
lunch counters.

<P>
   Farther from home, GM placed a vote of confidence in China's
auto market, despite Asia's slump. The company said it would invest
$100 million in a joint venture with a Chinese company to make
pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles in Shenyang. &QL;

   THE ECONOMY &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Vigorous Growth &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Businesses and consumers went on a spending spree in the first
quarter, causing the economy to grow much more quickly than
originally believed. The nation's gross domestic product increased
at a seasonally adjusted 5.4 percent annual rate in the period, the
Commerce Department reported, revising the estimate a month ago of
4.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In May, however, orders for durable goods fell 2.6 percent, to
$184.3 billion, as the economic crisis in Asia reduced orders for
transportation- and electronics-related goods. But no matter how
strong the economy, consumers can find reason for complaint: Prices
of important services like dental care, hotels and car maintenance
have been climbing. &QL;

<P>
   The Bull Returns &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After a two-week nap, the market's bull seemed to awaken with
new vigor. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index climbed to a
record at midweek, but moved slightly higher on Friday, ending the
week at 1,133.20, still up 32.55, and the Dow Jones industrial
average, after crossing the 9,000 hurdle for the first time since
June 10, relaxed a bit, to end the week at 8,944.54, up 231.67.
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks propelled the week's gains. Analysts said the
market's next direction would depend on second-quarter corporate
profits.  &QL;

   A Break for Investors &QL;

   Congressional leaders agreed to give investors a break on
capital gains taxes, attaching the measure to an overhaul of the
IRS that appears headed for speedy passage. The holding period for
long-term gains _ which are taxed at a maximum of 20 percent _
would be cut to 12 months from the present 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   The 18-month rule, created a year ago in a compromise between
Republican leaders and the Clinton administration, greatly
complicated calculations for many taxpayers. And the Senate
approved a bill that would provide tax breaks for parents who save
for education costs, including private-school tuition. President
Clinton has said he will veto the legislation. &QL;

<P>
   OIL &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Less Production. Really? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The 11 members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries, along with Mexico and Norway, planned to cut production
by 3.2 million barrels a day to reduce a global oil glut. But
traders cast a jaundiced eye, noting that some OPEC members
traditionally ignore their quotas, and oil prices retreated from a
four-day rally, ending the week at $14.13 a barrel on the New York
Mercantile Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   The recent drop in oil prices has prompted several oil-producing
countries to borrow money and reduce social spending to make up for
lost income from oil exports. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   RETAIL &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Saks on the Block &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The board of Saks Holdings, the holding company for the New
York-based retailer, approved a sale or merger of the 97-store
chain, and retained Goldman, Sachs and Merrill Lynch to assist.
</P>
<P>
   Such a move would end the majority ownership by Investcorp
International, the Bahrain-based investment bank, which has
profited by investing in other luxury retailers like Tiffany and
Gucci &UR;  &LR; and selling them.
</P>
<P>
   Investcorp bought Saks in 1990 for $1.6 billion, and sold 20
percent of Saks to the public in 1995 for $25 a share, or $425
million. Who might buy? Saks executives? Federated or May
Department Stores? Nordstrom? Harcourt General, which owns Neiman
Marcus?
</P>
<P>
   No one knows. Nor does anyone know how much a Saks sale would
bring, but $1.8 billion to $2.5 billion seems likely. &QL;

BALMY SUMMER TURNS INTO NEW YORK AREA INTO A SAUNA 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By SUSAN SACHS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Friday was the kind of day when the humid air was as
palpable as a damp rag. It was the kind of day that brought to mind
an expansive health-club steam cabinet or, if you were a Russian
immigrant lolling on the boardwalk in Brighton Beach, a banya, the
rustic Russian equivalent of a sauna.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe not.
</P>
<P>
   ``A banya is pleasant,'' said Lisa Reysish, 63, as she paused in
desultory conversation with friends under a sun-scorched aluminum
awning at Brighton Fourth Street. ``This is not. At least you can
get out of a banya.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the weather dissolved into heavy thunderstorms and
brought the temperature down to the low 80s late in the afternoon,
the New York area was swimming through a steamy haze that left many
people hot, bothered and bewildered after an early summer of
relatively cool temperatures.
</P>
<P>
   It may be hard to recall, but it was just two weeks ago, on June
12, that the temperature in Central Park climbed to a high of only
65 degrees. During the first half of the month, it was never hotter
than 73. On May 13, it was a chilly 44.
</P>
<P>
   Summer appeared with the heat of a furnace Thursday, when a high
of 90 was recorded in Central Park. At 2:28 p.m. Friday, the high
in the park was 92. It may have been 8 degrees cooler than the 1952
record high of 100. But it still felt like 100, according to the
National Weather Service heat index, which factors in humidity.
</P>
<P>
   Cool sounded good to New Jersey beachgoers, who ventured into
the chilly 65-degree water off Manasquan and Point Pleasant, said
Frank Storino of Jenkinson's Pavilion, which operates the beach at
Point Pleasant Beach. In the Hamptons, 19-year-old John Miller
played hooky from his job at a Brooklyn warehouse, ostensibly to
attend a wedding but more to escape the heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have tried to take off anyway,'' he said. ``It's a
metal building. I feel sorry for the people who were there today.''
</P>
<P>
   Consolidated Edison reported the third-highest electricity usage
in the utility's history, although spokesman Michael Spall said it
had no problem meeting demand. Although no records were broken
Friday _ the highest-ever demand was on sweltering July 13, 1997 _
Spall said they might fall later this summer due to low office
space vacancies in New York City and increased air-conditioning
usage.
</P>
<P>
   However, Connecticut power companies, hampered by the shutdown
of Northeast Utilities' nuclear power plants two years ago, were
forced to put emergency conservation measures into effect as the
temperature climbed in the early afternoon. The companies appealed
to commercial and industrial users to cut back on their power use
and instituted brownouts across the state by reducing voltage by 5
percent. Across New England, other electric utility officials also
asked customers to shut off unnecessary appliances to help conserve
energy.
</P>
<P>
   In New York City, the Fire Department said it responded to 63
incidents of heat stroke or heat exhaustion between midnight and
4:30 p.m., when rain broke the heat spell. Area airports reported
delays of up to one and a half hours for takeoffs, reflecting not
only stormy weather elsewhere in the country but also the effects
of heat and humidity on aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   That same brand of heavy heat affected male sartorial habits,
making many men curse the day the necktie was invented. In midtown
Manhattan, lawyers and executives walked tieless, coatless and in
one or two cases, shirtless.
</P>
<P>
   At the tie counter at Saks Fifth Avenue, Charles Worrell
admitted that even he, a tie salesman for eight years now, will go
so far as to loosen his when he leaves the air-conditioned comfort
of the store. ``Sales go down in the summer,'' he said. ``Today is
a really slow day.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, at the Fifth Avenue entrance to the Plaza Hotel, a
doorman, Ed Trinko, said he just puts his wartime experience to use
when the weather turns dangerously hot. Decked out in brimmed hat,
jacket, white gloves, black slacks and heavy black shoes _ plus
tie, of course _ he advised a course of steadfastness and plenty of
liquids.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trick is not to go inside,'' he said. ``You go inside, you
come out, you feel hot. I stay outside six, seven hours. I drink a
lot of club soda. You get a little breeze from the park. I got
training for being in heat in Vietnam, in the jungles. As soon as I
get off, I put on shorts, loafers. I feel great.''
</P>
<P>
   In Long Island City, Joe Rossi, manager of Tops Appliance City,
could feel the scorcher coming. He said he ordered 10 additional
sales people in to work Friday. By 1 p.m., he said, the store sold
300 air-conditioners _ almost double the 160 sold on the same day
last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm burning up,'' explained one happy customer, Faye Evans,
51, who was buying her second air-conditioner. ``I'm in an
apartment over a boiler. In my bedroom, it's as hot as it is
outside.''
</P>
<P>
   If the weather seems capricious this year _ remember March had
both snow and balmy 80-degree weather within the space of a week _
that's because it is.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're hostage to Mother Nature,'' said Ingrid Amberger, a
meteorologist with the National Weather Service office in Upton,
N.Y., which monitors New York City, Long Island, southern
Connecticut, northeast New Jersey and the lower Hudson Valley.
``There's just been a slight shift in the jet stream. Before we
were on the cool side and now we're on the hot side. It's not the
end of the world _ it just feels that way.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the weather in the New York area should begin to cool
off a bit today, with a high temperature in the mid-80s, and by
Sunday daytime temperatures will drop to the 70s.

8-FIGHT, $30 MILLION DEAL MAKES TRINIDAD SMILE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By TIMOTHY W. SMITH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Felix Trinidad, the International Boxing Federation welterweight
champion, was beaming Friday, because for the first time in a long
time he felt like a star. Main Events and HBO held a news
conference to announce an eight-fight, $30 million deal with
Trinidad, one of the best, but most unheralded boxers in the most
competitive division in the sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a star right now,'' Trinidad, a 25-year-old from Puerto
Rico, said through an interpreter. ``With Don King I didn't receive
the treatment as a star. With this contract I expect HBO and Main
Events to put me on the level of a star.''
</P>
<P>
   If all goes as expected, Trinidad, who has a 33-0 record (28
knockouts), will start his tenure with Main Events and HBO with a
flourish, going against Ike Quartey, the World Boxing Association
welterweight champion, on Nov. 22.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect the signing of Felix Trinidad to take Main Events
into the next century as far as big-time boxing is concerned,''
said Dino Duva, the Main Events president.
</P>
<P>
   It was an even bigger coup for HBO, which now has all of the
welterweight world champions _ Quartey, Trinidad, and Oscar De La
Hoya, the World Boxing Council champion _ under contract. So, the
network will be able to set up a long-talked-about match between
Trinidad and De La Hoya.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest fight in the sport is Trinidad versus De La
Hoya,'' said Seth Abraham, president of Time-Warner/HBO Sports.
``We're square in the middle.''
</P>
<P>
   Abraham said the earliest possible date for that fight would be
next May and the latest is September 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Duva, Trinidad, and his attorney, Jose Medina, expect Don King,
Trinidad's former promoter, to challenge his new contract with Main
Events. Medina has filed a lawsuit against King in U.S. District
Court in Manhattan seeking an injunction against King to keep him
from interfering in Trinidad's new contract. King is disputing
whether Trinidad is free to sign a new contract, because he
contends that Trinidad's contract has two more years left. Trinidad
claims his contract with King expired June 11.
</P>
<P>
   Savarese's Future
</P>
<P>
   Lou Savarese put an end to James (Buster) Douglas' dreams of any
rematches against Mike Tyson or Evander Holyfield in the near
future with a first-round technical knockout on Thursday night's
pay-per-view card at Foxwoods Resort Casino.
</P>
<P>
   Savarese's thundering right hands exposed Douglas' chin as being
brittle now and threw a wrench into promoter Bob Arum's plans to
make those lucrative matches for Douglas.
</P>
<P>
   Arum is Douglas' promoter, but he did not have an option on a
championship fight for Savarese, who will continue to be promoted
by Cedric Kushner. Whether Savarese can now take Douglas' place in
the heavyweight championship derby remains to be seen. After the
Thursday night bout there was talk that Savarese might get a shot
at Lennox Lewis, the World Boxing Council champion, if a
Lewis-Holyfield unification bout can not be made by the end of this
year.
</P>
<P>
   A Reid Homecoming
</P>
<P>
   It will be something of a homecoming for David Reid tonight when
the young junior middleweight with a 9-0 record fights from the
Apollo at Temple University.
</P>
<P>
   Reid, a Philadelphia native and the only U.S. boxer to win a
gold medal in the 1996 Atlanta Games, will meet the wily veteran
Simon Brown (47-7), who is coming off a February knockout loss to
Bernard Hopkins.
</P>
<P>
   Shane Mosley (27-0), the IBF lightweight champion, will defend
his title against Wilfrido Ruiz (25-3) of Monteria, Columbia.

GETTING BACK TO BASICS, CIA IS HIRING MORE SPIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (EXCLUSIVE; 10:45 p.m. ET EMBARGO for print media; 12:01 a.m. ET
EMBARGO for electronic media.) 
(bl) 
 By JAMES RISEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The CIA is beginning the largest recruitment drive
for new spies in its history, in an ambitious effort to rebuild its
espionage service, which has been severely damaged by spy scandals,
budget cutbacks and high turnover since the end of the Cold War,
officials say.
</P>
<P>
   With Congress already providing increased financing, the
Directorate of Operations, the CIA's clandestine espionage arm,
will hire record numbers of case officers _ spies _ beginning this
year as part of a new strategic plan to repair the decaying
espionage capabilities of the United States by 2005, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to expanded hiring, the CIA also plans to reopen
several overseas stations that were closed in the early 1990s after
the demise of the Soviet Union led Congress and the White House to
reduce the CIA's budget sharply.
</P>
<P>
   The recruitment plan is a sign that the CIA recognizes that it
has become far too dependent on so-called technical intelligence,
or eavesdropping devices and spy satellites. Now, the agency wants
to get back to espionage basics, by increasing its ability to place
a spy behind enemy lines or inside the offices of a rival
government.
</P>
<P>
   The spread of new technologies like encryption and computer
networks has eroded the value of spy satellites and listening
devices and has led the CIA to see the need for an expanded cadre
of spies. Without having an agent in place, the CIA has found it
much harder to gain access to secrets from rival governments,
terrorists and international organized crime groups.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, in 1998, the CIA plans to hire more than five times
as many case officers than it did in fiscal year 1995, when the
agency hit its post-cold-war recruitment low, U.S. officials said.
The agency plans to hire even larger numbers in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The actual numbers of new spies and new stations are classified,
and officials declined to comment on the precise figures. But other
officials have said recently that there are well under 1,000 case
officers working in the directorate.
</P>
<P>
   The expansion at the directorate has strong support in the House
of Representatives, where Speaker Newt Gingrich pushed through
supplemental financing for the CIA for fiscal 1998 to enable the
agency to begin recruitment efforts. For 1999, the House leadership
is again pushing for a sharp financing increase, while the Senate
is proposing a smaller increase, congressional sources said. The
exact amount of money involved is classified.
</P>
<P>
   Many intelligence officials have been complaining privately that
the Directorate of Operations has lost much of its effectiveness,
and that it has failed to conduct critical espionage missions
around the world.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the directorate has suffered a drain of talented senior
and mid-career officers since the end of the Cold War, and many of
those officers have left complaining about sagging morale and a
heavy-handed bureaucracy that made it hard for American spies to
take risks.
</P>
<P>
   A punishing series of scandals, including the spy cases of
turncoats Aldrich Ames and Harold Nicholson, both Directorate of
Operations officers who spied for Moscow, also sapped the spirit
inside the agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is fair to say that the DO has lost a lot of its
capabilities, and has been dangerously close to becoming
paralyzed,'' said one American intelligence official.
</P>
<P>
   Officials emphasize that the number of officers resigning has
declined in the past year, but acknowledge that the losses have
been serious.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have lost disproportionately large numbers of case officers
compared to people from other parts of the staff, and that has hurt
our capabilities,'' one official said. ``The loss of the
capabilities in the DO have been fairly serious since the beginning
of the decade.''
</P>
<P>
   Recently, when the CIA has tried to spy, its officers have often
been caught. Since 1995, CIA officers have been embroiled in public
accusations of spying by France, Germany and other nations, and
agency officials now believe that part of the problem is that
agents have failed to emphasize the basics of the espionage craft.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA's recent failure to accurately predict that India would
conduct nuclear tests has underlined that something had to be done,
both at the agency's headquarters in Langley, Va., and on Capitol
Hill. Support among members of Congress to finance the
directorate's expansion has increased since the India failure,
congressional officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In May, the CIA was forced to admit that it did not have any
agents who could have tipped the United States to India's plans,
and that confession showed Congress just how badly the CIA's
espionage network had eroded in recent years. Yet in the Senate,
concerns over India have also been working against proposals for a
large budget increase.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., chairman of the Senate Select
Committee on Intelligence, is wary of agreeing to the large budget
increase proposed by the House, an aide to Shelby said. In part,
Shelby's caution stems from a concern that the India controversy
signaled management problems that cannot be fixed by simply
throwing money at the agency, the aide said.
</P>
<P>
   While Shelby supports a budget increase, he is ``more concerned
about quality, not quantity, at the CIA,'' the aide said.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA is recruiting case officers, and people to support them,
with technical skills that spies have rarely been asked to learn in
the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we tried to figure out our requirements for the future, we
realized we needed to have greater technical support for agent
operations,'' said one U.S. official.
</P>
<P>
   At the top of the list of requirements is computer expertise.
The proliferation of global computer data networks, for example,
has made it more difficult for the agency to slip into a country
using false identifications. Only computer experts can defeat those
local computer systems, and even developing countries routinely
make sophisticated computer checks on passports and visas.
</P>
<P>
   The agency is recruiting on campuses, in the private sector and
from among military officers. Agents are on the same pay scale as
other federal employees and military officers.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA's decision to reopen some of its closed overseas
stations is also driven by the new complexities of post-Cold War
espionage. Many of the stations in the developing world were closed
because the Cold War's end made unnecessary their chief mission to
recruit and spy on Soviet diplomats and KGB. officers serving in
the same countries.
</P>
<P>
   But now, officials say they realize that those remote stations
will be important in the CIA's efforts to spy on terrorists and
other international criminals who have sought haven in those
countries.

ENGLAND ADVANCES _ PEACEFULLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LENS, France _ This seemed a recipe for disaster. Approximately
70,000 fans, some hoping to instigate a ``world hooligan
championships,'' were to invade a pastoral setting north of Paris,
one of the smallest venues ever to play host to the World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   But the anticipated problems were either controlled or dispersed
by limiting the supply of alcohol and discouraging ticket-less fans
from congregating for England's 2-0 victory over Colombia Friday,
which enabled the Britons to advance to the second round. Just to
make certain, French riot police turned the area into a garrison,
turning away suspected troublemakers.
</P>
<P>
   The Stade Felix Bollaert, which has a capacity nearly 7,000
greater than Lens's population, was surrounded by police carrying
tear gas guns and clubs and leading attack dogs, determined to
avoid the incident which left gendarme Daniel Nivel, 43, comatose
after last Sunday's Germany-Yugoslavia game.
</P>
<P>
   But if English hooligans, and possibly rival Germans,
represented a threat outside the stadium, English fans inside
provided song and dance in a festive celebration of their team's
victory. It was easy to see why so many of their countrymen would
want to be part of such a passionate display, which included an
effective and inspiring brand of soccer by the national team.
</P>
<P>
   The English fans far outnumbered the Colombians and were in a
peaceful and celebratory mood, filling the stadium with banners and
flags and chanting and singing loudly enough to reach the English
Channel 50 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   They had much to cheer as England qualified to meet Argentina
Tuesday in St. Etienne.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Owen, an 18-year-old Liverpool striker, started for the
first time in the World Cup and had a field day.
</P>
<P>
   Owen helped set up the first goal by easily outmaneuvering
Antonio Moreno and sending a cross, which was headed away by Jorge
Bermudez. Darren Anderton settled the clearance and roofed a shot
from the edge of the penalty area in the 20th minute. Ten minutes
later, David Beckham crashed a free kick into the upper left
corner, igniting a conga line in the stands.
</P>
<P>
   Owen was too active and quick for the much bigger, more
experienced Moreno. And he typified England's greater
maneuverability in midfield, where Beckham and Paul Scholes were
constantly threatening. The Colombians, eliminated in the first
round for the second straight World Cup, had several enterprising
forwards despite having sent Faustino Asprilla home, but none were
as effective as Alan Shearer.
</P>
<P>
   And Carlos Valderrama lacked his usual magic touch, though coach
Hernan Dario Gomez crowded the midfield with too many like-minded
players and failed to find a complementary strike force.
</P>
<P>
   Colombia's starting lineup failed to connect in the first half,
relying on Valderrama, Harold Lozano, and Freddie Rincon, all
possession-type midfielders. Then Gomez brought on another, Victor
Hugo Aristizabal, in the second half. Gomez added size at forward,
replacing Antony de Avila and Colombia's answer to Owen,
21-year-old Leider Preciado, with Hamilton Ricard and Adolfo
Valencia.
</P>
<P>
   The Colombians became more dangerous on offense but more at risk
defensively. Bermudez and goalkeeper Farid Mondragon prevented a
worse rout.
</P>
<P>
   Though none of the English players showed the individual
imagination of Paul Gascoigne, the team is creative enough. Beckham
and Scholes, bolstered by Paul Ince in midfield, provided dynamism.
And the strike force was effective, especially with Owen replacing
Teddy Sheringham alongside Shearer. Sheringham risked being cut
after a wild drinking binge in Portugal just before the World Cup
and appears superfluous now. Owen provides England with a younger,
better-behaved, and, simply, better player.

ANALYSIS: A KEY ELEMENT OF REPUBLICANS' MANAGED CARE BILL IS GUILE
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By LIZETTE ALVAREZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ They gritted their teeth, but on Wednesday, with
their health-care gurus lined up shoulder to shoulder, House
Republicans unveiled their plan to patch up managed care with such
measures as expanding a patient's ability to choose a doctor and to
receive emergency care.
</P>
<P>
   But as they did, they raised an important question: Did
Republican leaders offer the plan simply to provide political cover
for the November elections, or are they genuinely trying to pass a
law to address patients' concerns?
</P>
<P>
   The answer, said close associates of Speaker Newt Gingrich, is
both.
</P>
<P>
   The first goal is easier. Even though no bill has been written
and no hearings have been held, the House rules should enable the
speaker to bring a measure to a vote this year. That would allow
Republican incumbents to trumpet their support for patients' rights
and permit Republican challengers to run advertisements attacking
Democrats for abandoning the cause.
</P>
<P>
   The second goal is more dicey.
</P>
<P>
   There is the Senate to contend with. Two weeks ago, it looked as
though Senate Republican leaders were still squeezing their eyes
shut, hoping the whole idea would just blow past them. Now that
House Republicans are promoting their own plan, that wishful
thinking has ended.
</P>
<P>
   Trent Lott, the Senate majority leader, who warned the insurance
industry last year to ``get off their backsides, open up their
wallets'' and lead the fight against an overhaul, said on Tuesday
``the bill will come before the Senate sometime this summer.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is a catch. House and Senate Republicans have not
really worked in tandem to come up with a bill. And with only 35
working days left, according to Congress' leisurely view of the
period between now and Oct. 9, its target adjournment date, they
are cutting it close.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, senators made clear that they are working at their own
pace.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no rushing,'' said Sen. Bill Frist, R-Tenn., a
physician who is on the task force on the issue, but ``something is
going to pass this year.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It will involve the rights of patients,'' Frist said. ``But we
are not going to have a knee-jerk response to the calls for
managed-care bashing.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Sen. Don Nickles of Oklahoma, the Republican leader
who is heading the group, said the Senate version will have ``some
comparable provisions'' to the House proposal. Like the House plan,
it will not grant patients the right to sue their health
maintenance organizations. Nickles reviles that idea, a central
issue for Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   But in the Senate, small minorities can stall legislation
especially as adjournment nears, so if Senate Republicans want to
get a bill passed, they will have to meet Democrats at least part
way.
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans were careful not to make their proposal too
palatable to Democrats. ``Liberals'' will not like this bill,
Gingrich said on Thursday. ``It's not a liberal bill.'' So he
scattered a few Republican hand grenades, like limiting medical
malpractice damages and expanding the kinds of health plans that
would be exempt from state laws.
</P>
<P>
   No one believes that the proposal, as is, will make it out of
Congress. Rep. Charlie Norwood, R-Ga., the renegade who ignored his
leaders' opposition a to bill to overhaul managed care months ago
and drummed up support for the issue, is the first to say so.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why aggravate Democrats when we can get a good bipartisan law
out of this,'' Norwood said. ``Everything that is in there in terms
of that other stuff won't be in there later on.''
</P>
<P>
   That ``stuff'' is most likely there for bartering purposes, not
that Republicans would not choose to revisit those issues. Limits
on medical malpractice awards have passed the House four times.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich knows that he will have to get President Clinton on
board to try to corral Democrats, but he expects the president to
be willing to compromise to get something done. If that willingness
pits Clinton against Rep. Richard Gephardt, the House Democratic
leader, and Democrats who would rather see the Republican Congress
accomplish nothing, all the better.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats are already working furiously to attack the House
Republican plan.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt stood next to a potted fig tree, with the image of Joe
Camel as a kind of theme-unifying prop behind it, and fired a
barrage of adjectives, ``We are going to try to prevent a fig leaf,
fraudulent, counterfeit bill from going through,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, Democrats have threatened to attach their own
patients' rights bill to other legislation after the recess.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republicans have now concluded that this is an issue that
they can't ignore,'' Sen. Tom Daschle, D-S.D., said. ``Now the
question is, how good will it be?''
</P>
<P>
   But the Clinton administration did not hesitate to pat
Republicans on the back for coming around on the issue, at least
part of the way. Even so, Vice President Al Gore quickly said that
the proposal, as is, is ``nothing more than a bill of goods.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the insurance industry, which opposes the proposal,
is ready to fight. One insurance industry group is planning a new
television advertising campaign against patient protections.
</P>
<P>
   But Norwood, the Republican whose revolt put pressure on his
party's leaders to face the issue, remained confident.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will take a brave Republican to vote against this bill,''
he said. ``And it will take a brave Democrat to vote against this
bill.''

EX-OFFICER GUILTY IN CHOKING DEATH OF MAN IN 1994 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Former Police Officer Francis Livoti, who was accused
in the 1994 death of a Bronx man that ignited a passionate debate
in New York City about police brutality, was convicted Friday in
federal court of violating the man's civil rights. He faces up to
10 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   The jury deliberated in U.S. District Court in Manhattan for
just five hours. In the two-week trial, prosecutors raised the
specter of a broad police cover-up and accused three police
officers of lying on the stand in the aftermath of the choking
death of Anthony Baez, 29, who died after a confrontation with the
officers outside his family's home. After the jury rendered its
verdict, a juror said outside the courtroom that the panel agreed
with the prosecution that the officers had lied.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Jo White, the U.S. attorney in Manhattan who took on the
case after Livoti was acquitted of criminally negligent homicide in
state court in 1996, said the verdict ``shows that police officers
who commit acts of brutality can be prosecuted and convicted, even
when other officers fabricate testimony or cover up the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Late Friday, federal authorities said they would investigate
whether the officers committed perjury or covered up what happened
in the early morning hours of Dec. 22, 1994, during a confrontation
with Baez that began when an errantly thrown football hit a police
car during a family game.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. White would say only, ``Our investigation of this entire
matter, including a review of all trial testimony, is continuing.''
</P>
<P>
   Livoti sat without expression as the verdict was announced and
left the courtroom without comment. The former officer, who is free
on bond, is to be sentenced Sept. 24 by Judge Shira Scheindlin.
</P>
<P>
   His lawyer, Stuart London, said he would appeal, adding: ``I
just got off the phone with him. He obviously is empathetic to the
family for the loss of their son. But he's not apologizing because
he did nothing wrong. That's an important distinction for him.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Baez's parents, Iris and Raymon, sat in tears and looked stunned
as the verdict was announced. Livoti, who had an extensive record
of police brutality complaints, was dismissed from the force last
year after a police disciplinary proceeding found that he had used
a prohibited choke hold on Baez while taking him into custody.
</P>
<P>
   ``Justice is done,'' Raymon Baez said outside court. ``It's a
message for the police that they cannot come here and lie.''
</P>
<P>
   His wife agreed, saying: ``You can't stand up in court and lie
and then go home like nothing happened. These are lives, people's
lives you're dealing with.''
</P>
<P>
   The jury had voted 10 to 2 as deliberations began late on
Thursday, and then quickly reached a consensus by early Friday
afternoon, said one juror, who refused to give his name.
</P>
<P>
   Identifying himself as a 25-year-old Upper West Side resident,
the juror said the panel did not believe the three officers who
testified for Livoti in the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``All three lied,'' the juror said. ``It wasn't just that they
were trying to cover up for Livoti, but for themselves, because if
they were witnesses to a crime, they were conspirators in the
act.''
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, though, the prosecution's case went beyond the
officers at the scene and raised larger questions of whether the
Police Department is institutionally reluctant to punish abusive
officers and those who cover up for them.
</P>
<P>
   In her comments after the verdict, Ms. White was critical of the
Police Department, saying that the case ``should remind us that
police officers who have a history of using excessive force must be
dealt with before, and not after, tragedy strikes.''
</P>
<P>
   Records show that Livoti had accumulated nine police brutality
complaints before the 1994 death of Baez, yet senior police
officials rejected a recommendation by his commander that he be
transferred to a clerical job or a less stressful precinct, in part
because he was a police union delegate and was protected by
connections high up in the chain of command.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said in court that Livoti's fellow officers on the
scene, before ever speaking with investigators, coordinated their
testimony in meetings in the parking lot of the 46th Precinct
station house, and with their lawyers at police union headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   Marilyn Mode, the deputy police commissioner for public
information, said the Internal Affairs Division would work closely
with the federal government to investigate ``any allegations of
police perjury or collusion.''
</P>
<P>
   At his daily news conference, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, speaking
from the lawn of Gracie Mansion, said the verdict ``underscores the
wisdom of the commissioner's decision of about a year ago in
dismissing Officer Livoti even though he had been acquitted'' on
the state charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``It brings some degree of justice to a case that for some
reason in the state court system didn't work out the way that at
least many people, including me, thought it should have,'' the
mayor said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that although the conviction could in no way compensate
for the death of Baez, ``sometimes when a just result is achieved,
it brings some degree of peace.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope that's the case here,'' Giuliani said.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Sandoval, Anthony Baez's aunt, said Livoti ``should do his
time.''
</P>
<P>
   She added: ``Now we're going after the cops that perjured
themselves. When we were demonstrating, marching from the precinct
to the 161st Street Courthouse, the mayor called us heckling fools.
He's the fool for not acknowledging that police brutality exists.''
</P>
<P>
   David Baez, now 21, who was playing touch football with his
brother the night of the confrontation, in which David was also
arrested, asked for a marker as he put up a sign on the fence in
front of the house. He wrote on a piece of cardboard, ``Livoti
Guilty At Last.''
</P>
<P>
   As he mounted the sign on the fence, he said, ``This is the
first bit of justice we ever got.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that the family still plays football on the street.

   STOCKS FINISH STRONG WEEK AS S&AMP;P 500 HITS RECORD
</P>
<P>
   The stock market rallied to close a week of solid gains, despite
resilient fears about the year-old economic crisis in Asia and its
eventual impact on corporate profits in this country. Investors bid
many blue-chip issues into record territory.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index rose 3.92 points, to a
record 1,133.20, giving it a 3 percent gain for the week and nearly
16.8 percent gain for the year. The Dow Jones industrial average
rose 8.96 points for the day and 231.67 points for the week, or 2.7
percent, to close at 8,944.54. The average is 3 percent below its
record high of May 13.
</P>
<P>
   CLEARER SEXUAL HARASSMENT LAW
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court clarified the law on workplace sexual
harassment, making some lawsuits against employers easier to win
while limiting the legal exposure of companies that have effective
anti-harassment policies. The rulings were praised by management
and civil rights groups for bringing coherence to the law and
providing incentives for preventing harassment and dealing with
problems.
</P>
<P>
   JAPAN DEBT SEEN AS WEAKEST LINK
</P>
<P>
   There is increasing agreement among Japanese politicians that
the economic malaise afflicting Japan and indirectly threatening
the global economy centers on a problem that the Japanese
government is only beginning to confront: the mountain of bad debts
at the nation's banks.
</P>
<P>
   CBS TO SELL NUCLEAR OPERATIONS
</P>
<P>
   CBS agreed to sell its Westinghouse nuclear and government
services operation to a joint venture formed by Morrison Knudsen
Corp. and a British nuclear-fuel processor for $238 million in cash
and the assumption of $950 million in liabilities and other
obligations.
</P>
<P>
   SPENDING AND INCOMES STRONGER
</P>
<P>
   Consumer spending and incomes rose in May, demonstrating the
economy's firm underpinnings as brisk domestic demand offset the
impact of the Asian slowdown on manufacturers.

<P>
   Fonorola, Canada's fourth-biggest long-distance provider,
advised shareholders to accept Call-Net Enterprises' sweetened
takeover offer of $1.2 billion (U.S.) and the assumption of debt.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA TRIP AVOIDS BUSINESS
</P>
<P>
   So far during his trip to China, President Clinton has played
down commercial links between the two countries. The president's
focus on diplomatic strategy, culture and tourism instead of
commerce is a sign that business ties have in some ways outgrown
the contract-by-contract nurturing of the 1980s and early 1990s.
Indeed, investing in China has gone from adventurous to ordinary.
</P>
<P>
   China gave the United States its strongest assurances yet that
it does not plan to devalue its currency, the yuan. The Clinton
administration fears that a devaluation by Beijing could spark a
wave of devaluations across Asia.
</P>
<P>
   KARL MARX, MARKET VISIONARY
</P>
<P>
   The globalization of national economies? Periodic crises like
Asia's financial turmoil? Long before any Wall Street pundit, Karl
Marx foresaw how the wealth-creating power of capitalism would
conquer the world. (Of course, he may not have been particularly
pleased with that outcome.) Still, on the 150th anniversary of The
Communist Manifesto, readers on the political left and right have
marveled at how Marx's description of capitalism resembles the
restless, anxious and competitive world of today's global economy.

 &HT;    Looking to link school lunchroom, water park
 &HT;    By Diane Lore and M.A.J. McKenna
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Public health officials confirmed Friday that a
strain of E. coli that infected at least four children swimming at
White Water park has the same genetic fingerprint as bacteria found
in hamburgers served this spring in a Madison County elementary
school.
</P>
<P>
   All of the samples also were found to match E. coli samples from
two Hull, Ga., sisters who did not visit White Water, but were
confirmed to be infected on June 2 and released Friday from
Egleston Children's Hospital in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   But beyond a ``laboratory match,'' there is no evidence linking
the burgers, the sisters and the water park, said Dr. Kathleen
Toomey, director of the Division of Public Health.
</P>
<P>
   Even if a connection is discovered, she said, it isn't
significant to the investigation because there is no continuing
risk from the beef, which was recalled in May after being sent to
Madison and three other Georgia county school districts. Anyone who
had eaten any of it would have become sick by now, Toomey said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's scientifically interesting ... but in this case, that's
not really what we care about,'' she said. In fact, Toomey said the
investigation is not focusing on a ``Baby Zero'' _the first child
to contract E. coli and spread it to others _ but how the cluster
at White Water park happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all part of unraveling the mystery, but from a public
health perspective, that's not the key,'' she said. ``What we are
interested in is how this transmission can occur in the water, and
understanding how kids use public pools and how E. coli can
overwhelm chlorination in a fecal accident.''
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen children are confirmed with E. coli O157:H7 that was
traced to White Water park _ nine from Georgia and four from
out-of-state, Toomey said. Stool samples from four of those
children were also subjected to a test called ``pulsed-field gel
electrophoresis'' (PFGE) that can distinguish among subtypes of the
O157 strain by reading its genetic pattern. All four, the agency
said, have identical genetic profiles.
</P>
<P>
   That profile also matches PFGE tests done on samples from the
sisters from Hull, which is in Madison County, about 70 miles east
of Atlanta. After public health investigators interviewed the
families, they found no link between the sisters and the White
Water cases.
</P>
<P>
   They also have failed to find a connection between the sisters
and contaminated meat that was served at Danielsville Elementary
School. The frozen beef-and-soy patties, manufactured by a Florida
firm in December, were recalled in mid-May because they were
believed, but never proven, to have caused a case of hemolytic
uremic syndrome (HUS), a life-threatening complication of E. coli
infection, in a Danielsville boy in April.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just goes to show that just because you've got the same
genetic material doesn't necessarily mean you have the same
original source,'' Toomey said. ``It could be that that particular
genetic strain is just more prevalent in a given community.''
</P>
<P>
   The Danielsville HUS case was confirmed Friday by the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention and the U.S. Department of
Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   On April 23, the agencies said, the boy developed symptoms
consistent with E. coli O157 infection _and which rapidly
progressed to HUS _ after eating part of a burger in the
Danielsville school lunchroom. The child, whom officials would not
identify, was admitted to an Atlanta hospital April 27; he is
diabetic and has other chronic health problems.
</P>
<P>
   The case was reported to the district and state public health
departments, and then to the school system, which told its
supplier, Bauer Meat Co. of Ocala, Fla., of the suspected link. The
company tested the meat and found O157; after consultation with
USDA, the company voluntarily recalled 38,000 pounds of fresh and
frozen patties on May 15. Roughly 11,800 pounds had gone to four
Georgia counties _ Madison, Hall, Green and Forsyth _ but officials
said none was consumed outside Madison County. The rest was sent to
overseas U.S. military facilities and several North Carolina school
districts, where no illnesses were reported.
</P>
<P>
   On May 19, the Madison County school board notified parents that
meat patties contaminated with the O157:H7 strain possibly had been
served until May 8, and testing of patties began May 9.
</P>
<P>
   The Danielsville boy was released from the hospital May 2.
Because no cultures were done on his stool, he was never
definitively diagnosed with O157, said USDA spokeswoman Jacque
Knight. But the culture done by Bauer on its beef product was sent
to USDA's outbreak lab for PFGE analysis. The genetic fingerprint
obtained was lent to the CDC and to Georgia this week, and matched
the genetic profile from the White Water cases and the Hull
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wouldn't be surprising if the strain in any sort of cluster
would resemble a strain that has been seen before,'' said Dr. Larry
Slutsker, a CDC epidemiologist and E. coli expert. ``One might
expect that a waterborne transmission (such as at White Water)
would ultimately have its source in a foodborne illness from
somewhere else. But it doesn't change the message that we need to
get out, about keeping children with diarrhea out of public
pools.''
</P>
<P>
   The CDC and the Georgia public health department are
collaborating to complete genetic tests on the remaining White
Water cases, Slutsker said. Results are expected by early next week
and will be shared with health departments in other states; if they
match with genetic profiles done on potential out-of-state cases,
the extent of the White Water outbreak will be defined.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer Meat Co. officials declined to comment, referring phone
calls to the National Meat Association, a California-based industry
group.
</P>
<P>
   There is no known link between the recalled Bauer meat products
and any of the White Water cases, said Rosemary Mucklow,
association director. She said the USDA had not notified her or
Bauer about a genetic link between the White Water cases and the
beef that Bauer voluntarily recalled May 15.
</P>
<P>
   ``That just doesn't sound possible,'' Mucklow said. ``I haven't
heard there is a genetic link to any recall, and the USDA normally
alerts us immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   Mucklow said the meat industry is instituting safeguards aimed
at killing the O157 microbe, changes that began after the 1993 Jack
in the Box outbreak that killed four children and sickened
hundreds.

   ``We are trying very, very hard to ensure the safety of the
meat. We've done all kinds of interventions to make sure this
microorganism doesn't get in,'' Mucklow said. One new method is
aimed at destroying the bug with the 160-degree temperature known
to kill it by using a ``steam vacuum'' that blows steam over the
carcass.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, public health workers are waiting for
confirmation on Monday from several lab tests on remaining cases,
said Joyce Goldberg, DPH spokeswoman. They also are interviewing
families and friends about habits in the past two weeks, including
restaurants they visited, food eaten, handwashing, children's
playmates and other people who might have come in contact with the
sick patients.
</P>
<P>
   And she said several more cases are expected to be confirmed in
coming weeks, partly because public health officials are expecting
a second wave of infections _ caused by those initially infected
spreading E. coli to friends and family.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect to see some cases crop up as secondary infections,''
she said.

 &HT;    E. coli investigations are familiar choreography for the
scientists
 &HT;    By M.A.J. McKenna
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- The investigation into this week's outbreak of E.
coli O157:H7 followed a pattern that's puzzling to the public but
comfortably familiar to disease scientists. Like a soccer ball
being moved downfield, detection moves from field work to lab work
and back again - and like a well-strategized play, it eventually
ends up at the goal.
</P>
<P>
   Infection with E. coli O157:H7, the toxin-producing strain of a
usually benign intestinal bacteria, is an immediately reportable
disease in Georgia. That means that, whenever a child or adult
seeks help for symptoms that resemble those of E. coli - chiefly
severe and bloody diarrhea - health-care workers must report the
case to the county or district health department. Those reports are
sent to the state Division of Public Health. And if something
appears unusual - such as a high number in a small area or a short
period of time - that triggers an investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Patients, family members and associates are interviewed for
common traits and experiences. Investigators log and track
activities, diet, places visited and other factors that may link
the cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``We start by basically doing shoeleather work: Is there some
way the cases are related?'' said Dr. Larry Slutsker of the
foodborne diseases branch of the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, which informally advised the state this week on the
White Water outbreak. ``Did they attend a common event, eat a
common food, swim in a common pool?''
</P>
<P>
   Once the epidemiologists - scientists who specialize in studying
how diseases move through a population - think they've identified a
cause or common route of transmission, the investigation may move
to the lab for a second stage of scientific inquiry. There they can
examine whatever materials seem important to the case: food, water,
materials from the environment, or samples taken from patients such
as blood or stool.
</P>
<P>
   In the White Water outbreak, lab work has required several
steps.
</P>
<P>
   First, technicians cultured stool samples from the patients
believed to have been infected with E. coli at White Water.
Cultures, grown on a gel medium, were done to establish whether the
infection was E. coli; two additional steps sought to determine
that the strain of E. coli was O157:H7 -- a life-threatening strain
-- by identifying two proteins found in two positions on the
bacterium's outer coat.
</P>
<P>
   In some of the cases, technicians performed a final test called
pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, which can distinguish between
subtypes of O157 by determining a unique ``genetic fingerprint''
linking the cases to a single, common source.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, only four of the 13 confirmed cases of E. coli traced
to White Water have been linked, through this genetic technique.
Health officials are awaiting test results on the others.
</P>
<P>
   Some times, lab results force investigators back to the field
for additional interviews. Other times, the initial field work
points so strongly to a potential source of the disease that lab
work merely confirms the guess.
</P>
<P>
   ``You try to formulate a public health action early on,''
Slutsker said. ``Sometimes you may be in the position of
implicating a food or an activity with just epidiological
information, without the benefit of lab confirmation.''
</P>
<P>
   Every step - identifying a disease, notifying authorities and
attempting to control it - takes at least a few days, and many
diseases resolve on their own, without treatment. Investigators are
frequently in the position of chasing something that remains just
out of reach.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a produce item is involved, it may no longer be on the
market; if it's an illness in which people were sick two, three,
four weeks ago, you're unlikely to be able to culture an organism
from them,'' Slutsker said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigations can take from a few weeks to months, depending on
many variables from the type of organism to the number of steps it
passed through to reach its eventual victims. But technology is
allowing shortcuts.

<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ When finance ministers and investment strategists have
nightmares these days, they often involve huge financial
institutions whose names are hardly household words in the West.
</P>
<P>
   Yet if names like Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank or Ashikaga Bank trip on
Western tongues, there is a growing apprehension that Japanese
financial institutions like them may threaten the long boom on Wall
Street and even the stability of the global economy.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's economy is in recession, its stock market has lost 60
percent of its value since the peak eight years ago, and its
currency has cascaded 43 percent from its high point in 1995. There
is increasing agreement in world financial capitals that the
problems center on something the Japanese government is only
beginning to confront: the mountain of bad debts at the nation's
banks.
</P>
<P>
   Now there is an emerging sense that the next few weeks may mark
a turning point for the banking crisis _ and, indirectly, for the
global economy to which it is connected.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation in Japan is a source of very considerable
concern,'' Lawrence Summers, the U.S. deputy treasury secretary,
said in Washington after his return this week from a trip to Japan
during which he sought to make Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto
face up to the debt crisis. Summers added that this was a ``pivotal
moment for Asia and the global economy.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. policy-makers fear that Japan is a weak link in the
international economy. Burdened by bad debts arising from a
property market that has tumbled as much as 90 percent, some of
Japan's largest banks are in a tenuous position. Merger talks
involving Long-Term Credit Bank, one of the most troubled
institutions, and Sumitomo Trust &AMP; Banking Co. Ltd., a somewhat
stronger bank, were confirmed Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Hashimoto says that the solution to the problem is what he
describes as the ``Total Plan.'' That is somewhat of a misnomer,
for at this stage the plan is neither total nor fully formed. It is
instead a vague idea of peeling bad loans off bank books and
reselling them in the marketplace, much as the United States
tackled the savings and loan crisis of the late 1980s by empowering
Resolution Trust Corp. to sell off bad assets from the thrifts.
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece of the Total Plan would be the creation of a
``bridge bank'' that would take over the loan portfolios of failing
banks, selling off good loans and laying to rest bad ones. The
bridge bank would also look after customers of failing
institutions, offering them a bridge so they could get by
temporarily until they were able to establish a relationship with
another bank.
</P>
<P>
   Hashimoto said that he would summon Parliament for a special
session late next month to pass legislation on the plan. The
question being asked increasingly by bankers, diplomats and
businessmen is no longer whether Hashimoto will act. It is whether
he will do enough, and whether the proposed cure will rescue the
Japanese economy or cripple it with more government intervention.
</P>
<P>
   ``The politicians are certainly starting to talk volubly about
something having to be done even before the elections,'' said
Minoru Makihara, the chairman of Mitsubishi Corp., referring to
parliamentary elections on July 12. ``That is something that they
didn't talk about earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now whether that will materialize or not, I don't know,''
Makihara added. ``But at least the situation seems to have moved in
the direction of action.'' William Seidman, former head of
Resolution Trust Corp., is advising Japanese politicians on the
banking crisis. ``I told them that there's no way they can do this
harmoniously,'' he said. ``It will involve some pain.''
</P>
<P>
   Japanese banks are only dimly understood in the West, yet they
are colossal _ the biggest bank in the world is Bank of
Tokyo-Mitsubishi, with more than $550 billion in total assets,
compared with less than $400 billion for Chase Manhattan Corp., the
biggest in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In a few cases, the Japanese banks are tottering. It was the
frailty of these vast institutions that led President Clinton and
Hashimoto to order joint intervention in the currency markets last
week to bolster the yen.
</P>
<P>
   There is concern not simply about the collapse of any individual
bank or the difficulties of its depositors, but rather about the
consequences for the entire economic structure. In an increasingly
globalized economy, there is a possibility that bank runs could
trigger a liquidity crisis that could race around the world in
minutes, sending markets plunging and ultimately provoking an
international economic slowdown.
</P>
<P>
   Nervousness about Japanese banks is in large part responsible
for the decline of the yen. The joint intervention on June 17
bolstered the yen initially, but now it is slipping again, having
weakened 0.14 yen Friday in New York, to 142.44 to the dollar. If
the yen falls further, it could escalate the Asian financial crisis
to a new level, particularly if China moves to devalue its
currency.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's big banks tend to all suffer from similar problems. All
have far more bad debt than would be acceptable in the United
States, but some are stronger than others. Bad loans as a
percentage of equity range from 90 percent at Sanwa to 371 percent
at Nippon Credit Bank _ compared with an average of 58 percent at
the 22 largest U.S. banks during the height of the American savings
and loan crisis in the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Among the stronger banks, Sumitomo is a part owner of Goldman,
Sachs, while Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, which is listed on the New
York Stock Exchange, is viewed as fundamentally sound.

 TOKYO: fundamentally sound.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Anxieties have been raised in the last couple of weeks over the
status of Long-Term Credit Bank, a venerable institution set up
after World War II to provide long-term loans to help finance the
nation's economic rebuilding.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, the government dealt with ailing banks by merging
them with stronger ones. The current banking landscape is a
kaleidoscope of banks piled upon banks.
</P>
<P>
   Long-Term Credit's quest has almost been a round robin,
reportedly including talks with several institutions, including
Nippon Credit Bank, itself essentially bailed out more than a year
ago when the government injected new capital; and with Dai-Ichi
Kangyo, itself the result of a rescue merger between Dai-Ichi Bank
and Nippon Kangyo Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Other market-moving reports said that Long-Term Credit was
turning to the ailing Daiwa Bank. American regulators ordered
Daiwa's U.S. operations shut down in 1995, after a bond trader
incurred more than $1 billion in losses and then tried, along with
the bank, to cover up the losses.
</P>
<P>
   Long-Term Credit may have found a match. On Friday, it confirmed
that it was discussing a possible merger with Sumitomo Trust &AMP;
Banking, a smaller bank specializing in money management for
institutional investors that has been forging ties with foreign
firms like Citibank.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone gets rescued, as Yamaichi Securities, a brokerage,
discovered when it went under last November. Then, Fuji Bank _ a
giant, somewhat wobbly bank that is also the government's paying
agent _ was Yamaichi's main banker, and its decision not to save
Yamaichi was considered rational by the market.
</P>
<P>
   But a few months later, tradition got the better of Fuji when it
stepped forward to support Yasuda Trust &AMP; Banking, an ailing trust
bank in Fuji's group of companies.
</P>
<P>
   How did Japan's banks come to be so weak?
</P>
<P>
   During the ``bubble economy'' of the late 1980s, Japanese land
prices soared to ridiculous levels, and it was said that the
Imperial Palace grounds in central Tokyo were worth as much as all
of California. Japanese banks went on a lending spree, expanding
their loan portfolios by $3.6 trillion _ a figure equivalent to 72
percent of the entire Japanese economy _ and in many cases taking
buildings as collateral.
</P>
<P>
   The real-estate market collapsed under its own weight, and the
value of Japanese land plunged, with prime properties in downtown
Tokyo falling to perhaps 10 percent of their peak values. The
result is that perhaps $600 billion in loans may be unrecoverable.
</P>
<P>
   Banks have been reluctant to sell property at these prices, so
there is almost no active real-estate market today. No one quite
knows the market price or the true level of bad loans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market is very inactive,'' said Teizo Taya, a managing
director at Daiwa Institute of Research. ``There are no buyers.''
</P>
<P>
   The government did little about the loans for eight years,
thinking that if property prices rose again, the problem would
right itself. And indeed, if the collateral was again worth more
than the property, the bad loans would become good. But the
direction of the market is uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see a quick turnaround,'' said Osamu Aoi, director at
Eiwa Real Estate Co. ``I'm covering the downside. I'm very
pessimistic. You have to have maximum pessimism toward Japanese
real estate in order to survive.''
</P>
<P>
   Another problem haunting the banking system _ and making it
difficult to resolve the crisis _ is that lending in Japan has been
a murky process. Loan documents are short and scanty, if they exist
at all, and bankers often performed little analysis on the
creditworthiness of the borrower or on the viability of the
project.
</P>
<P>
   Often they lent simply on relationships, or because they owned
shares in the companies asking for loans. That in turn makes
collecting on bad loans a bit awkward.
</P>
<P>
   ``The banks have been avoiding drastic change,'' said Heizo
Takenaka, professor of economics at Keio University. ``Even the
president of a bank doesn't understand his own loan portfolio.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, the banks have been reluctant to write off bad loans,
partly because they do not have enough in profits or in capital to
absorb those losses. ``They have a lot of loans on their books at
the original value and they may have to write them off at 20 to 30
cents on the dollar,'' said Robert Hormats, vice chairman of
Goldman, Sachs International. ``They don't want to acknowledge the
fact that 70 to 80 percent of the value of those loans has
disappeared.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the banks are reluctant to foreclose on loans,
seizing property, evicting clients and being publicly branded as
heartless capitalists.
</P>
<P>
   Some bankers also are afraid of foreclosing on properties
occupied by anyone affiliated with the Yakuza, the Japanese mafia,
who have set up shop in many buildings that are the collateral for
loans.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, an executive director in the Nagoya branch of Sumitomo
Bank, one of Japan's most innovative and largest banks, was fatally
shot. News reports suggested that his murder may have been related
to efforts to collect on bad loans related to the Yakuza.
</P>
<P>
   The bad-loan crisis has done more than create risks for the
future. It has also had direct effects on Japan's economy,
exacerbating the recent recession.
</P>
<P>
   The most alarming problem for many ordinary Japanese businesses
has been a credit squeeze throughout the country. Banks are calling
loans from small and medium-sized businesses, or even from the
affiliates of their big clients, and this is crimping investment
and making the economic outlook less favorable.
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, the credit squeeze has been intensified by the
government's efforts to liberalize the banking sector. The
government has been trying to restructure the financial industry,
imposing stricter rules and embarking on a broad program of
liberalization, called the Big Bang. In the process of preparing
for these changes, Japanese banks have been trying to trim their
assets to meet capital-adequacy requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Ohta, a general manager in charge of treasury at NEC Corp.
said that liquidity ``is the most important problem a Japanese
corporate treasurer faces.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ohta said that NEC assured its access to financing by
turning to Citibank, which arranged a syndicated loan. Ohta said,
``Liquidity is a problem we haven't experienced for a long time.''

<P>
   BEIJING _ President Clinton was received by Chinese President
Jiang Zemin on Saturday in a military ceremony on Tiananmen Square,
the vast expanse through which modern Chinese history has flowed,
from the declaration of the communist state in 1949 to the crushing
of democracy demonstrations 40 years later.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton stood mute throughout, as is customary at such arrival
ceremonies. He and Jiang then inspected army troops and reviewed an
honor guard on ground that human rights advocates around the world
consider stained with the blood of martyrs.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has defended his appearance before the Great Hall of the
People on the edge of Tiananmen Square as the expected behavior of
a state visitor to China. The square was the site of student-led
demonstrations that ended in terror and bloodshed on June 3 and 4,
1989, when Chinese troops moving into the city center mowed down
hundreds of civilians. Clinton was expected to discuss the 1989
demonstrations in his remarks later in the day.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton stood stiffly as the People's Liberation Army band
played ``The Star Spangled Banner'' and an evocative 21-gun
cannonade rang out across the square. The gunfire continued through
the playing of the Chinese national anthem, ``March of the
Volunteers.''
</P>
<P>
   The two presidents then inspected an honor guard in green, white
and blue uniforms bearing rifles with fixed bayonets.
</P>
<P>
   As they finished reviewing the troops, Clinton and Jiang turned
and walked along a red carpet toward the steps of the Great Hall of
the People, smiling and chatting. In 13 minutes, the ceremony,
which stirred such memories and generated such controversy, was
over.
</P>
<P>
   The ceremony came at the start of a one-day summit meeting that
had already been marred by the detention and harassment of several
Chinese political dissidents. The dispute forced Clinton and his
senior aides into a defensive crouch and threatened to undermine
China's central goal of the summit _ a portrait of a ``new China''
of greater economic and personal freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's appearance on the square Saturday morning dramatized
this nation's struggle between memory and forgetting.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese leadership hopes to consign to history the events of
the spring of 1989, when indelible images of blood-letting in the
streets and of a lone protester standing before a column of tanks
were broadcast around the world. The events are the subject of a
continuing dispute in China.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to the party's Central Committee, Zhao Ziyang, who
has been under house arrest since he was ousted as Communist Party
chief at the time of Tiananmen, challenged the nation's leaders to
admit that the incident was reprehensible as well as an immense
political blunder.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, harshly criticized in the United States for lending his
prestige to Beijing's leaders by attending the ceremony, hopes that
his presence here will force the world to remember that bloody
night nine years ago.
</P>
<P>
   After the Tiananmen Square ceremony, a news conference by the
two presidents was planned to deliver statements about the results
of their 90-minute meeting.
</P>
<P>
   A senior American official said they had agreed on several
items, including a pledge to redirect the nuclear-tipped ballistic
missiles now aimed at each other's cities. The step is largely
symbolic, because such weapons can be targeted in a matter of
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang also agreed that China would ``actively study'' joining
the Missile Technology Control Regime, an international agreement
governing the sale of certain missiles and missile technology.
China has resisted the pact because missile exports are a key
money-maker for the military. No timetable was set for China's
actually joining the regime.
</P>
<P>
   The two countries also agreed on a joint statement on the
nuclear arms race now under way in South Asia, including pledges
not to export to India or Pakistan any missiles, missile equipment
or materials capable of delivering nuclear weapons. The agreement
covers only medium- and long-range missiles, however.
</P>
<P>
   China has also agreed to permit inspections of Chinese sites
receiving high-technology equipment from the United States to
assure that it is being put to its intended use and not diverted
for military purposes.
</P>
<P>
   This provision has gained increased importance in recent weeks
with disclosures that China may have used commercial satellites for
military communications, and earlier revelations that computers
supposedly for industrial applications had been diverted to
military installations.
</P>
<P>
   But there was no concrete progress on a number of American human
rights concerns, including the treatment of Tibet and an accounting
for hundreds of political prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   An American official involved in the summit talks said he was
hopeful that signs of progress on rights might come in the weeks
and months after Clinton leaves China.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes things are not announced at the summit, but happen
afterward,'' this official said.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders also agreed to expand of the Peace Corps presence
here and to work toward new cooperation on legal reforms,
environmental programs and a new clean energy project to reduce the
emissions of coal-burning power plants.
</P>
<P>
   The summit results amount to a ``pretty substantial package,''
the official said. But many of the military and nonproliferation
items were expected and represented at best incremental steps.

 BEIJING: incremental steps. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On Friday, the White House sharply criticized Beijing for the
harassment of dissidents on the first day of Clinton's state visit,
calling the detentions ``thoroughly unacceptable.'' But the
president did not take steps to impose any punishment or withhold
any favors in response.
</P>
<P>
   Using unusually harsh language, Sandy Berger, the national
security adviser, said the Chinese internal security apparatus was
``doing what comes naturally'' by harassing outspoken opponents of
the government who officials fear might embarrass Beijing during
the president's visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are not debris to be swept up for a visitor,'' Berger
said at a briefing for reporters on Friday in Xian, before the
presidential entourage flew to Beijing for the summit meeting. ``We
certainly will not accept this.''
</P>
<P>
   Human rights groups reported that four dissidents were detained
in two Chinese cities and one was removed from Xian in the hours
before Clinton's arrival Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   China demonstrated little concern about the detentions, denying
that anyone had actually been ``arrested'' and offering American
diplomats no explanation for their actions. Chinese authorities
routinely round up dissidents and other potential troublemakers
before important events.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese authorities added to the friction Friday night by
impeding two Asian-American White House staffers who were trying to
load the president's luggage aboard Air Force One at Xian's
airport. Mike McCurry, the White House press secretary, attributed
the incident to ``over-eager'' Chinese security officials who were
not expecting to find Asians in the presidential party.
</P>
<P>
   The incident was resolved in a few minutes and the stewards were
allowed to board the aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Berger tried to explain Beijing's crackdown on dissidents as a
remnant of its police-state past, a preference for order over
political freedom. He said the repression was diminishing, if
slowly.
</P>
<P>
   ``China is changing, but there are still forces that are pulling
the other direction, that are resisting,'' Berger said. ``I think
China's human rights record is terrible. I think China is an
authoritarian nation, as I've said before. I think there's been
some progress in human rights, but it has been not nearly enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the area of public dissent, they are still totally
unacceptable. I don't think this is directed at President Clinton.
The fact that it happens generally in connection with these kinds
of visits, it is not appropriate, it is not necessary,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Clinton said he found reports of the
detentions ``disturbing,'' but gave no indication that he would
change his approach to China in response. ``I think it makes the
case, it makes it all the more important that we continue to work
with the Chinese and engage them.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Jendrzejczyk, director of Human Rights Watch Asia, said the
administration's unwillingness to respond with more than words was
a sign that the White House was ``desperate not to offend the
Chinese.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The administration is walking on eggshells, determined to
demonstrate that this visit represents a major breakthrough in
relations,'' Jendrzejczyk said. ``The Chinese are being tough. They
know their bottom line, and the administration seems willing to
accommodate them at any cost.''
</P>
<P>
   He called on the president to signal his displeasure by
withholding something the Chinese want, such as the planned visit
to the United States later this year by Prime Minister Zhu Rongji.
</P>
<P>
   But Berger said the United States planned nothing beyond verbal
protests. He said it would be against American interests to impose
any punishment or withhold any agreements as a result of the police
action. And he offered a partial excuse for the Chinese action,
saying it was not as severe as previous roundups of dissidents
before the arrival of important foreign visitors.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the White House was defending the Tiananmen Square
appearance, there appeared to be little Chinese movement on issues
the United States considers central to the relationship.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has been pressing for China to permit the live,
nationwide broadcast of Clinton's Monday speech, in which the
president is expected to deliver his strongest message on human
rights.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing has resisted and White House officials said Saturday
that it appeared the speech would be seen everywhere in the world
but China.

<P>
   In two rulings Friday, the Supreme Court established the
following rules for deciding when an employer is liable in a sexual
harassment case:
</P>
<P>
   An employer is subject to vicarious liability to a victimized
employee for an actionable hostile environment created by a
supervisor with immediate (or successively higher) authority over
the employee.
</P>
<P>
   When no tangible employment action is taken, a defending
employer may raise an affirmative defense to liability or damages,
subject to proof by a preponderance of the evidence.
</P>
<P>
   The defense comprises two necessary elements: (a) that the
employer exercised reasonable care to prevent and correct promptly
any sexually harassing behavior, and (b) that the plaintiff
employee unreasonably failed to take advantage of any preventive or
corrective opportunities provided by the employer or to avoid harm
otherwise ...
</P>
<P>
   No affirmative defense is available, however, when the
supervisor's harassment culminates in a tangible employment action,
such as discharge, demotion or undesirable reassignment.

DIPLOMATIC APPROACH WINS LITTLE IN ALBANY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JACQUES STEINBERG   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Among the biggest losers in Albany this month, by his
own admission, was Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew.
</P>
<P>
   Crew was stymied on virtually all that he sought, whether it was
eliminating tenure for principals, gaining approval for a
year-round school calendar, getting an additional $200 million to
repair city schools, or finally settling the long-running fight
over the city's fair share of state education aid.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's like a guy who went out with a trick-or-treat bag but
didn't get any candy,'' said Norman Adler, a longtime lobbyist
whose clients include Local 891 of the International Union of
Operating Engineers, which represents school custodians. ``Maybe
next year he should change his costume.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview last week, Crew acknowledged his losses and said
he bore ``a substantial amount of the fault.'' But he defended his
instinct for quiet, patient diplomacy, which he said will pay off
in the long run. ``This is just round one,'' he said. ``You might
not like my style. You may not like that there is not much blood
and guts. That's OK''
</P>
<P>
   On some issues, the chancellor's failures were largely out of
his hands. Gov. George Pataki, a Republican, vetoed the
Legislature's $500 million school construction package _ $200
million of it intended for the city _ in part because the measure
was championed by the state's highest-ranking Democrat, Assembly
Speaker Sheldon Silver, in an election year.
</P>
<P>
   And many chancellors have trouble getting what they want from
Albany, where their quest to persuade upstate and Long Island
legislators to raise school aid for New York City can seem
quixotic.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the obstacles, some of those who watched the chancellor
negotiate said that he had demonstrated surprisingly little
inclination to expend political capital on the issues that, at
least publicly, he ranked as high priorities.
</P>
<P>
   Despite drawing headlines early in the legislative session for
his bid to strip principals of lifetime tenure, for example, Crew
did not seriously work behind the scenes to push the issue in
Albany, officials said. This, despite the fact that he had the
blessing of his political patron, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   That the chancellor would take such a cautious tack seems a bit
remarkable to some education lobbyists, given that he is among the
most popular figures in the city, whether measured by political
polls or the conga line of adults who seek his firm handshake
wherever he goes. The sheer size of the school system makes his a
potentially formidable constituency.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you represent a million schoolchildren, the governor and
legislative leaders are never going to tell you they won't talk to
you,'' said one education lobbyist. ``He can do a lot of damage.''
</P>
<P>
   But Crew has rarely been anything but a polite guest in the
halls of government. He almost never criticizes the mayor or
governor or Assembly speaker or Senate majority leader by name, and
almost always responds to political setbacks with faxed press
releases, rather than by taking to the airwaves or seeking to rile
up parents on the steps of City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why he doesn't show more anger on behalf of the children
he represents, Crew said that any short-term gain would be
outweighed by long-term harm.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could get a one-shot bang,'' Crew said of the idea of
going on the attack, much as Giuliani does. ``That, at the very
least, as I see politics played in New York state, gets you on the
nightly news and gets your children nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``After that, you could lose everything,'' he said. ``You could
lose the art of ever being able to walk in the governor's door or
have your phone call taken.''
</P>
<P>
   But for all his conciliating, Crew has so far compiled an uneven
record in Albany as he finishes his third school year.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, in one of the biggest political victories by any
chancellor, the Legislature stripped the city's 32 community school
boards of their hiring powers and effectively awarded them to Crew.
Though the pressure had been building on the legislators for years,
Crew seized the moment, knitting together a coalition that helped
prod Albany into action.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Crew has been reluctant to push the Legislature
further, even on the issue of eliminating principal tenure, despite
his contention that only by holding principals accountable can he
fully exercise his new authority.
</P>
<P>
   The chancellor is nothing if not a political realist, and he was
well aware that the teachers' union, the United Federation of
Teachers, supported the principals. Though there is no love lost
between the two groups, the teachers' union could ill afford to
advocate curbing anyone's rights of tenure. And no lobbying group
gives more to the legislators' campaigns than the teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe it is the right issue,'' the chancellor said. ``I
think I'm in the wrong time. There's just no political will to lift
this one.'' In an interview, the mayor agreed, saying, ``I think
Albany is capable of only so much reform each year.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the chancellor came away from Albany empty-handed, he did
leave with one new chit. After the governor vetoed an annual
allocation known as teachers support aid _ which adds about $1,000
each year to the paychecks of each city teacher _ Crew wrung the
$63 million needed from the school system's budget.
</P>
<P>
   That should serve him well as he attempts to persuade the
teachers' union to agree to his year-round school plan, for only
with the union's assent will he be able to move the Legislature to
finance the venture, which it has rebuffed two years in a row.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not finished,'' said the chancellor, who is seeking a
two-year contract extension that would make him, by 2001, the
school system's longest-serving chief executive since Eisenhower
was president. ``What people don't count on is long-term, sustained
tenacity.''  &QL;

CARPENTER IS KILLED WHILE WORKING ON TOWER IN TIMES SQUARE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Budgeted earlier as NY-CONSTRUCTION-MISHAP)   (bl)  
 By JAYSON BLAIR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A carpenter working on the Conde Nast skyscraper in
Times Square was fatally injured Friday morning when he was crushed
by an elevator that was lowered as he worked in an elevator shaft.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said the elevator was working properly and that
they were trying to find out why the man was in the shaft, where he
was caught between the elevator and the structure's scaffolding on
the 43rd floor about 9:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Rescue crews used an adjacent elevator to reach the man and
tried to revive him for nearly 10 minutes before he regained a
pulse, said Lt. Wayne Baskin, the emergency medical specialist who
gave the man CPR.
</P>
<P>
   But the man was pronounced dead at Bellevue Hospital Center
about 10:40 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with the company managing the project, Tishman
Construction Corp., said that many workers at the site at 4 Times
Square were sent home after being made available to federal and
city investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Police did not release the victim's name Friday, but
construction workers identified him as Charles Robbins, 43, a
carpenter with Universal Building Supply, a subcontractor hired to
operate and maintain the elevators used to haul building materials
at the site.
</P>
<P>
   Police investigators deemed the death an accident, according to
a spokeswoman for the department. Investigators from the federal
Occupational Safety and Health Administration and inspectors from
the city's Buildings Department were also looking into the death.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Birkhahn, a spokesman for the Buildings Department, said
that city inspectors determined that the elevator was working
properly.
</P>
<P>
   An investigator, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said
he was baffled as to why the victim was working in the elevator
shaft while the elevator was in use.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Kielar, a spokesman for Tishman, said that OSHA
inspectors visited the construction site last week and gave it a
clean bill of health. OSHA officials said that they could not
confirm the results of that inspection and that an accident history
for the project would not be available until Monday.
</P>
<P>
   When completed in mid-1999, the 48-story, 1.6
million-square-foot building will serve as the headquarters for
Conde Nast Publications, the publisher of The New Yorker, Vanity
Fair, GQ, Glamour, Vogue and dozens of other magazines. It will
also be home to the Manhattan law firm Skadden Arps Slate Meagher &AMP;
Flom.
</P>
<P>
   The death was the first fatality since construction began at
Four Times Square in 1996, but it was the third accident at the
building since January.

CHARLES KORVIN, 90, FILM ACTOR WHO PLAYED CADS
</HEADLINE>
  (ATTN.: Caalif.) 
 (ja) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Charles Korvin, an actor who made a career playing
gentleman thieves and philandering husbands, died on June 18 at
Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. He was 90 and had homes in
Manhattan and Klosters, Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   Korvin, whose original name was Geza Karpathi, was born in
Piestany, Hungary. He was educated at the Sorbonne in Paris, where
he remained for 10 years as a still and motion picture
photographer, directing the documentary film ``Heart of Spain'' for
CBC Canada in 1937.
</P>
<P>
   He moved to the United States in 1940 and studied acting at the
Barter Theater in Abingdon, Va., before making his Broadway debut
in ``Dark Eyes'' in 1943 under the name Geza Korvin.
</P>
<P>
   After seeing him in that role, the producer Charles Feldman
sized up the actor as star material and took him to Hollywood,
where he became a contract player for Universal Studios.
</P>
<P>
   With his chiseled good looks and Continental charm, he adopted
the name Charles Korvin and made his film debut in 1945 in ``Enter
Arsene Lupin'' as a dashing French thief.
</P>
<P>
   He was then paired romantically with Merle Oberon in three
films: ``This Love of Ours,'' ``Temptation'' and ``Berlin
Express.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1947, Universal suspended Korvin's salary after he refused
the role of a villain in ``Black Velvet.'' He continued to work
independently for studios including Columbia, Paramount and 20th
Century Fox.
</P>
<P>
   Korvin was blacklisted around 1951 for refusing to cooperate
with the House Committee on Un-American Activities, his family
said.
</P>
<P>
   He did not work in Hollywood for 10 years, until the director
Stanley Kramer invited him to be in his 1965 film ``Ship of
Fools,'' with Vivien Leigh, Simone Signoret and Lee Marvin.
</P>
<P>
   During this period, he continued to work in television and
appeared on ``Playhouse 90,'' ``U.S. Steel Hour,'' ``Zorro,'' ``I
Spy'' and ``Holocaust,'' as well as on an episode of ``The
Honeymooners,'' in which he played Carlos the Latin dance
instructor.
</P>
<P>
   Korvin is survived by his wife, Natasha; a daughter, Katherine
Pers, of Budapest; a son, Edward Danziger Korvin, of Santa Monica,
Calif.; and three grandchildren.

4.0, or just have a jones for adding to Bill Gates' little pile o'
cash (now estimated at a nice, round $50 billion), do you really
need to spend a C note or more to upgrade your computer to Windows
98?
</P>
<P>
   Probably not.
</P>
<P>
   Not that you could tell, given the noise that's greeted the
first name-change upgrade to Windows in three years. The Seattle
area hasn't had this much hype since the last Pearl Jam album. And
in some ways, the release of Win98 is similar to ``Yield.''
</P>
<P>
   In both cases, stores opened just after midnight to sell copies
of the work to ardent supporters. Critics called each product
solid, with some interesting new wrinkles, but far from
revolutionary. And each was destined to be a big seller.
</P>
<P>
   It must be something in the water, or the coffee, up there in
Rainland. But understand, this set of improvements isn't going to
have the same impact that Windows 95 did.
</P>
<P>
   Windows 95 justified the hype surrounding its release. It
dramatically improved on its predecessor, Windows 3.1, with
numerous major changes in the way people used their PCs.
</P>
<P>
   But even Win95 has been accepted slowly by many people with
existing systems who often have been reluctant to give up programs
that won't run on the upgrade.
</P>
<P>
   The same questions, only more so, are expected to hold up
adoption of Win98, according to International Data Corp., which
projected recently that Win98 will sell about 15 percent more
slowly than its predecessor in its first 18 months on shelves.
</P>
<P>
   That still means gargantuan numbers, 12.8 million copies in the
first year, according to International Data, and 66 million over
the first three. So slow to adopt doesn't mean ``no'' to adopt.
</P>
<P>
   It does show, however, that Win98 isn't necessarily the
operating system for the rest of the DOS universe, said Jessica
Branson, associate editor of CNET.Com, a large technology-oriented
Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you buy a new system, Win98 is what you're going to get,''
Branson said. ``If you're on an old system, though, you're probably
not going to benefit from Windows 98. It's really not for everyone.
The bottom line is the real people who benefit from this are
Microsoft and the computer industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Family PC magazine, which gave early versions of the program to
10 test families for five months to see how it would hold up in
real-world testing, could only give Win98 so-so reviews, said Bob
Ryan, the magazine's senior editor for hardware.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are ambivalent because there's not one great compelling
reason to upgrade,'' Ryan said. ``If you have a system using
Windows 95 that does pretty much all you want, and it's not
crashing, we don't see the point of upgrading right now. If you're
satisfied with your desktop, why muck it up?''
</P>
<P>
   Win98 does offer many nifty, if not knockout, improvements on
its predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   To start with, there's Microsoft's controversial efforts to
integrate its Web browser, Internet Explorer 4.0, as a natural part
of Windows, rather than as a glommed-on extra, to be used or not as
desired.
</P>
<P>
   It's part of a larger strategy to expand the computer desktop
into the Internet, to even transform it so that it runs more like
the World Wide Web. Indeed, users have the option of making the
entire desktop run like a series of one-click folders, just as on a
Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Win98 is more stable than its predecessor, with many bug fixes
and improvements to the system's basic operations, though it, like
Win95, is still perched like an elephant on the rickety platform of
MS-DOS.
</P>
<P>
   By including native versions of hundreds of little programs,
called drivers, that help the system to talk to peripherals such as
hard drives and scanners, Microsoft has eliminated a major source
of crashes. And by including native support for Universal System
Bus devices, and for DVD-based drives, it will allow much more
flexibility for gamers and others wanting to add to their systems.
</P>
<P>
   The system also includes WebTV for Windows, a controller
designed to work with interactive television systems as the Great
Convergence of the Net and TV arrives in the next few years.
</P>
<P>
   And in a long-overdue move, the company includes a number of
``accessibility options'' for the handicapped, including the
ability to magnify text for the vision-impaired. But it's the kind
of little thing that the Macintosh OS has had for years that only
now is being added to the dominant PC platform.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan also pointed out that many of the improvements are
available for free, allowing a person to create most of Win98
without spending anything more than some time on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   If you have the patience, Internet Explorer, many of the bug
fixes and the Direct X controls for gaming, all can be downloaded
for free from Microsoft's Internet sites.
</P>
<P>
   The program does include a number of useful utilities, including
an updated disk defragmenter and a program that automatically
updates the system by regularly checking for patches, bug fixes and
other improvements on the Net.
</P>
<P>
   But overall, it may not be worth it to many folks until they buy
their next machine, or their next big hardware add-on.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are going to be specific instances where Win98 is a
no-brainer,'' Ryan said. ``Unfortunately, for most people, it's
very much of a brainer. They can probably postpone the upgrade
until they get their first USB scanner or they install a TV-tuner
card.''

   WASHINGTON _ Following are excerpts from Friday's Supreme Court
decisions in two sexual harassment cases, Burlington Industries vs.
Ellerth and Faragher vs. City of Boca Raton. The opinion in the
Burlington case was written by Justice Anthony M. Kennedy and that
in the Boca Raton was by Justice David H. Souter. Joining them in
the majorities were Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices
Stephen G. Breyer, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sandra Day O'Connor and
John Paul Stevens. Dissenting opinions, which are also excerpted,
were filed by Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   FROM THE DECISION IN THE BURLINGTON CASE
</P>
<P>
   By Justice Kennedy
</P>
<P>
   We decide whether, under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of
1964, an employee who refuses the unwelcome and threatening sexual
advances of a supervisor, yet suffers no adverse, tangible job
consequences, can recover against the employer without showing the
employer is negligent or otherwise at fault for the supervisor's
actions.
</P>
<P>
   Summary judgment was granted for the employer, so we must take
the facts alleged by the employee to be true. The employer is
Burlington Industries, the petitioner. The employee is Kimberly
Ellerth, the respondent. From March 1993 until May 1994, Ellerth
worked as a salesperson in one of Burlington's divisions in
Chicago, Ill. During her employment, she alleges, she was subjected
to constant sexual harassment by her supervisor, one Ted Slowik.
</P>
<P>
   In the hierarchy of Burlington's management structure, Slowik
was a mid-level manager. Burlington has eight divisions, employing
more than 22,000 people in some 50 plants around the United States.
Slowik was a vice president in one of five business units within
one of the divisions. He had authority to make hiring and promotion
decisions subject to the approval of his supervisor, who signed the
paperwork. According to Slowik's supervisor, his position was ``not
considered an upper-level management position,'' and he was ``not
amongst the decision-making or policy-making hierarchy.''
</P>
<P>
   Slowik was not Ellerth's immediate supervisor. Ellerth worked in
a two-person office in Chicago, and she answered to her office
colleague, who in turn answered to Slowik in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Against a background of repeated boorish and offensive remarks
and gestures which Slowik allegedly made, Ellerth places particular
emphasis on three alleged incidents where Slowik's comments could
be construed as threats to deny her tangible job benefits.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer of 1993, while on a business trip, Slowik invited
Ellerth to the hotel lounge, an invitation Ellerth felt compelled
to accept because Slowik was her boss. When Ellerth gave no
encouragement to remarks Slowik made about her breasts, he told her
to ``loosen up'' and warned, ``(y)ou know, Kim, I could make your
life very hard or very easy at Burlington.''
</P>
<P>
   In March 1994, when Ellerth was being considered for a
promotion, Slowik expressed reservations during the promotion
interview because she was not ``loose enough.'' The comment was
followed by his reaching over and rubbing her knee.
</P>
<P>
   Ellerth did receive the promotion; but when Slowik called to
announce it, he told Ellerth, ``You're gonna be out there with men
who work in factories, and they certainly like women with pretty
butts/legs.''
</P>
<P>
   In May 1994, Ellerth called Slowik, asking permission to insert
a customer's logo into a fabric sample. Slowik responded, ``I don't
have time for you right now, Kim, unless you want to tell me what
you're wearing.'' Ellerth told Slowik she had to go and ended the
call.
</P>
<P>
   A day or two later, Ellerth called Slowik to ask permission
again. This time he denied her request, but added something along
the lines of ``Are you wearing shorter skirts yet, Kim, because it
would make your job a whole heck of a lot easier.''
</P>
<P>
   A short time later, Ellerth's immediate supervisor cautioned her
about returning telephone calls to customers in a prompt fashion.
In response, Ellerth quit. She faxed a letter giving reasons
unrelated to the alleged sexual harassment we have described.
</P>
<P>
   About three weeks later, however, she sent a letter explaining
she quit because of Slowik's behavior.
</P>
<P>
   During her tenure at Burlington, Ellerth did not inform anyone
in authority about Slowik's conduct, despite knowing Burlington had
a policy against sexual harassment. In fact, she chose not to
inform her immediate supervisor because `` `it would be his duty as
my supervisor to report any incidents of sexual harassment.' '' On
one occasion, she told Slowik a comment he made was inappropriate.
</P>
<P>
   In October 1994, after receiving a right-to-sue letter from the
Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (E.E.O.C.), Ellerth filed
suit in the United States District Court for the Northern District
of Illinois, alleging Burlington engaged in sexual harassment and
forced her constructive discharge, in violation of Title VII.
</P>
<P>
   The district court granted summary judgment to Burlington. The
court found Slowik's behavior, as described by Ellerth, severe and
pervasive enough to create a hostile work environment, but found
Burlington neither knew nor should have known about the conduct.
There was no triable issue of fact on the latter point, and the
Court noted Ellerth had not used Burlington's internal complaint
procedures.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Although Ellerth's claim was framed as a hostile work
environment complaint, the district court observed there was a quid
pro quo ``component'' to the hostile environment. Proceeding from
the premise that an employer faces vicarious liability for quid pro
quo harassment, the district court thought it necessary to apply a
negligence standard because the quid pro quo merely contributed to
the hostile work environment.
</P>
<P>
   The court of appeals en banc reversed in a decision which
produced eight separate opinions and no consensus for a controlling
rationale. The judges were able to agree on the problem they
confronted: Vicarious liability, not failure to comply with a duty
of care, was the essence of Ellerth's case against Burlington on
appeal. . . .
</P>
<P>
   We must decide, then, whether an employer has vicarious
liability when a supervisor creates a hostile work environment by
making explicit threats to alter a subordinate's terms or
conditions of employment, based on sex, but does not fulfill the
threat. We turn to principles of agency law, for the term
``employer'' is defined under Title VII to include ``agents.''
</P>
<P>
   In express terms, Congress has directed Federal courts to
interpret Title VII based on agency principles. Given such an
explicit instruction, we conclude a uniform and predictable
standard must be established as a matter of Federal law. We rely
``on the general common law of agency, rather than on the law of
any particular State, to give meaning to these terms.'' The
resulting Federal rule, based on a body of case law developed over
time, is statutory interpretation pursuant to Congressional
direction. This is not Federal common law in ``the strictest sense,
i.e., a rule of decision that amounts, not simply to an
interpretation of a Federal statute . . . , but, rather, to the
judicial `creation' of a special Federal rule of decision.''
</P>
<P>
   As Meritor acknowledged, the Restatement (Second) of Agency
(1957) (hereinafter Restatement), is a useful beginning point for a
discussion of general agency principles. Since our decision in
Meritor, Federal courts have explored agency principles, and we
find useful instruction in their decisions, noting that
``common-law principles may not be transferable in all their
particulars to Title VII.'' The E.E.O.C. has issued guidelines
governing sexual harassment claims under Title VII, but they
provide little guidance on the issue of employer liability for
supervisor harassment.
</P>
<P>
   Section 219(1) of the Restatement sets out a central principle
of agency law:
</P>
<P>
   ``A master is subject to liability for the torts of his servants
committed while acting in the scope of their employment.''
</P>
<P>
   An employer may be liable for both negligent and intentional
torts committed by an employee within the scope of his or her
employment. Sexual harassment under Title VII presupposes
intentional conduct. While early decisions absolved employers of
liability for the intentional torts of their employees, the law now
imposes liability where the employee's ``purpose, however
misguided, is wholly or in part to further the master's business.''
In applying scope of employment principles to intentional torts,
however, it is accepted that ``it is less likely that a willful
tort will properly be held to be in the course of employment and
that the liability of the master for such torts will naturally be
more limited.'' . . .
</P>
<P>
   At the outset, we can identify a class of cases where, beyond
question, more than the mere existence of the employment relation
aids in commission of the harassment: when a supervisor takes a
tangible employment action against the subordinate. Every Federal
court of appeals to have considered the question has found
vicarious liability when a discriminatory act results in a tangible
employment action. . . .
</P>
<P>
   In the context of this case, a tangible employment action would
have taken the form of a denial of a raise or a promotion. The
concept of a tangible employment action appears in numerous cases
in the courts of appeals discussing claims involving race, age, and
national origin discrimination, as well as sex discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   Without endorsing the specific results of those decisions, we
think it prudent to import the concept of a tangible employment
action for resolution of the vicarious liability issue we consider
here.
</P>
<P>
   A tangible employment action constitutes a significant change in
employment status, such as hiring, firing, failing to promote,
reassignment with significantly different responsibilities, or a
decision causing a significant change in benefits.
</P>
<P>
   When a supervisor makes a tangible employment decision, there is
assurance the injury could not have been inflicted absent the
agency relation. A tangible employment action in most cases
inflicts direct economic harm. As a general proposition, only a
supervisor, or other person acting with the authority of the
company, can cause this sort of injury. A co-worker can break a
co-worker's arm as easily as a supervisor, and anyone who has
regular contact with an employee can inflict psychological injuries
by his or her offensive conduct. But one co-worker (absent some
elaborate scheme) cannot dock another's pay, nor can one co-worker
demote another.
</P>
<P>
   Tangible employment actions fall within the special province of
the supervisor. The supervisor has been empowered by the company as
a distinct class of agent to make economic decisions affecting
other employees under his or her control.
</P>
<P>
   Tangible employment actions are the means by which the
supervisor brings the official power of the enterprise to bear on
subordinates. A tangible employment decision requires an official
act of the enterprise, a company act. The decision in most cases is
documented in official company records, and may be subject to
review by higher level supervisors. The supervisor often must
obtain the imprimatur of the enterprise and use its internal
processes.
</P>
<P>
   For these reasons, a tangible employment action taken by the
supervisor becomes for Title VII purposes the act of the employer.
Whatever the exact contours of the aided in the agency relation
standard, its requirements will always be met when a supervisor
takes a tangible employment action against a subordinate. In that
instance, it would be implausible to interpret agency principles to
allow an employer to escape liability, as Meritor itself appeared
to acknowledge.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the agency relation aids in commission of supervisor
harassment which does not culminate in a tangible employment action
is less obvious. Application of the standard is made difficult by
its malleable terminology, which can be read to either expand or
limit liability in the context of supervisor harassment.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, a supervisor's power and authority invests his
or her harassing conduct with a particular threatening character,
and in this sense, a supervisor always is aided by the agency
relation. On the other hand, there are acts of harassment a
supervisor might commit which might be the same acts a co-employee
would commit, and there may be some circumstances where the
supervisor's status makes little difference.
</P>
<P>
   It is this tension which, we think, has caused so much confusion
among the courts of appeals which have sought to apply the aided in
the agency relation standard to Title VII cases. The aided in the
agency relation standard, however, is a developing feature of
agency law, and we hesitate to render a definitive explanation of
our understanding of the standard in an area where other important
considerations must affect our judgment. In particular, we are
bound by our holding in Meritor that agency principles constrain
the imposition of vicarious liability in cases of supervisory
harassment. . . .
</P>
<P>
   In order to accommodate the agency principles of vicarious
liability for harm caused by misuse of supervisory authority, as
well as Title VII's equally basic policies of encouraging
forethought by employers and saving action by objecting employees,
we adopt the following holding in this case and in Faragher v. Boca
Raton, also decided today.
</P>
<P>
   An employer is subject to vicarious liability to a victimized
employee for an actionable hostile environment created by a
supervisor with immediate (or successively higher) authority over
the employee. When no tangible employment action is taken, a
defending employer may raise an affirmative defense to liability or
damages, subject to proof by a preponderance of the evidence.
</P>
<P>
   The defense comprises two necessary elements: (a) that the
employer exercised reasonable care to prevent and correct promptly
any sexually harassing behavior, and (b) that the plaintiff
employee unreasonably failed to take advantage of any preventive or
corrective opportunities provided by the employer or to avoid harm
otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   While proof that an employer had promulgated an anti-harassment
policy with complaint procedure is not necessary in every instance
as a matter of law, the need for a stated policy suitable to the
employment circumstances may appropriately be addressed in any case
when litigating the first element of the defense. And while proof
that an employee failed to fulfill the corresponding obligation of
reasonable care to avoid harm is not limited to showing any
unreasonable failure to use any complaint procedure provided by the
employer, a demonstration of such failure will normally suffice to
satisfy the employer's burden under the second element of the
defense. No affirmative defense is available, however, when the
super- visor's harassment culminates in a tangible employment
action, such as discharge, demotion or undesirable reassignment.
</P>
<P>
   Although Ellerth has not alleged she suffered a tangible
employment action at the hands of Slowik, which would deprive
Burlington of the availability of the affirmative defense, this is
not dispositive. In light of our decision, Burlington is still
subject to vicarious liability for Slowik's activity, but
Burlington should have an opportunity to assert and prove the
affirmative defense to liability.
</P>
<P>
   For these reasons, we will affirm the judgment of the court of
appeals, reversing the grant of summary judgment against Ellerth.
On remand, the district court will have the opportunity to decide
whether it would be appropriate to allow Ellerth to amend her
pleading or supplement her discovery.
</P>
<P>
   FROM THE DISSENT
</P>
<P>
   By Justice Thomas
</P>
<P>
   The Court today manufactures a rule that employers are
vicariously liable if supervisors create a sexually hostile work
environment, subject to an affirmative defense that the Court
barely attempts to define. This rule applies even if the employer
has a policy against sexual harassment, the employee knows about
that policy, and the employee never informs anyone in a position of
authority about the supervisor's conduct.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, employer liability under Title VII is judged by
different standards depending upon whether a sexually or racially
hostile work environment is alleged. The standard of employer
liability should be the same in both instances: An employer should
be liable if, and only if, the plaintiff proves that the employer
was negligent in permitting the supervisor's conduct to occur.
</P>
<P>
   Years before sexual harassment was recognized as
``discriminat(ion) because of sex,'' the courts of appeals
considered whether, and when, a racially hostile work environment
could violate Title VII. In the landmark case Rogers v. E.E.O.C.,
the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit held that the practice
of racially segregating patients in a doctor's office could amount
to discrimination in `` `the terms, conditions, or privileges' ''
of employment, thereby violating Title VII. The principal opinion
in the case concluded that employment discrimination was not
limited to the ``isolated and distinguishable events'' of ``hiring,
firing, and promoting.'' Rather, Title VII could also be violated
by a work environment ``heavily polluted with discrimination,''
because of the deleterious effects of such an atmosphere on an
employee's well-being.
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly, after Rogers, a plaintiff claiming employment
discrimination based upon race could assert a claim for a racially
hostile work environment, in addition to the classic claim of
so-called ``disparate treatment.'' A disparate treatment claim
required a plaintiff to prove an adverse employment consequence and
discriminatory intent by his employer. A hostile environment claim
required the plaintiff to show that his work environment was so
pervaded by racial harassment as to alter the terms and conditions
of his employment. This is the same standard now used when
determining whether sexual harassment renders a work environment
hostile. . . .
</P>
<P>
   If a supervisor creates a hostile work environment, however, he
does not act for the employer. As the Court concedes, a
supervisor's creation of a hostile work environment is neither
within the scope of his employment, nor part of his apparent
authority. Indeed, a hostile work environment is antithetical to
the interest of the employer. In such circumstances, an employer
should be liable only if it has been negligent. That is, liability
should attach only if the employer either knew, or in the exercise
of reasonable care should have known, about the hostile work
environment and failed to take remedial action.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Sexual harassment is simply not something that employers can
wholly prevent without taking extraordinary measures _ constant
video and audio surveillance, for example _ that would
revolutionize the workplace in a manner incompatible with a free
society.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, such measures could not even detect incidents of
harassment such as the comments Slowick allegedly made to
respondent in a hotel bar. The most that employers can be charged
with, therefore, is a duty to act reasonably under the
circumstances. As one court recognized in addressing an early
racial harassment claim:
</P>
<P>
   ``It may not always be within an employer's power to guarantee
an environment free from all bigotry. . . . (H)e can let it be
known, however, that racial harassment will not be tolerated, and
he can take all reasonable measures to enforce this policy. . . .
But once an employer has in good faith taken those measures which
are both feasible and reasonable under the circumstances to combat
the offensive conduct we do not think he can be charged with
discriminating on the basis of race.''
</P>
<P>
   Under a negligence standard, Burlington cannot be held liable
for Slowick's conduct. Although respondent alleged a hostile work
environment, she never contended that Burlington had been negligent
in permitting the harassment to occur, and there is no question
that Burlington acted reasonably under the circumstances. The
company had a policy against sexual harassment, and respondent
admitted that she was aware of the policy but nonetheless failed to
tell anyone with authority over Slowick about his behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Burlington therefore cannot be charged with knowledge of
Slowick's alleged harassment or with a failure to exercise
reasonable care in not knowing about it.
</P>
<P>
   Rejecting a negligence standard, the Court instead imposes a
rule of vicarious employer liability, subject to a vague
affirmative defense, for the acts of supervisors who wield no
delegated authority in creating a hostile work environment. This
rule is a whole-cloth creation that draws no support from the legal
principles on which the Court claims it is based. Compounding its
error, the Court fails to explain how employers can rely upon the
affirmative defense, thus ensuring a continuing reign of confusion
in this important area of the law. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Thus although the Court implies that it has found guidance in
both precedent and statute _ its holding is a product of willful
policymaking, pure and simple. The only agency principle that
justifies imposing employer liability in this context is the
principle that a master will be liable for a servant's torts if the
master was negligent or reckless in permitting them to occur; and
as noted, under a negligence standard, Burlington cannot be held
liable.
</P>
<P>
   The Court's decision is also in considerable tension with our
holding in Meritor that employers are not strictly liable for a
supervisor's sexual harassment. Although the Court recognizes an
affirmative defense _ based solely on its divination of Title VII's
gestalt, _ it provides shockingly little guidance about how
employers can actually avoid vicarious liability. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Popular misconceptions notwithstanding, sexual harassment is not
a freestanding Federal tort, but a form of employment
discrimination. As such, it should be treated no differently (and
certainly no better) than the other forms of harassment that are
illegal under Title VII. I would restore parallel treatment of
employer liability for racial and sexual harassment and hold an
employer liable for a hostile work environment only if the employer
is truly at fault. I therefore respectfully dissent.
</P>
<P>
   FROM THE DECISION
</P>
<P>
   IN THE BOCA RATON CASE
</P>
<P>
   By Justice Souter
</P>
<P>
   This case calls for identification of the circumstances under
which an employer may be held liable under Title VII of the Civil
Rights Act of 1964, for the acts of a supervisory employee whose
sexual harassment of subordinates has created a hostile work
environment amounting to employment discrimination. We hold that an
employer is vicariously liable for actionable discrimination caused
by a supervisor, but subject to an affirmative defense looking to
the reasonableness of the employer's conduct as well as that of a
plaintiff victim.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1985 and 1990, while attending college, petitioner Beth
Ann Faragher worked part time and during the summers as an ocean
lifeguard for the marine safety section of the Parks and Recreation
Department of respondent, the City of Boca Raton, Fla. During this
period, Faragher's immediate supervisors were Bill Terry, David
Silverman, and Robert Gordon. In June 1990, Faragher resigned.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Faragher brought an action against Terry, Silverman,
and the City, asserting claims under Title VII. So far as it
concerns the Title VII claim, the complaint alleged that Terry and
Silverman created a ``sexually hostile atmosphere'' at the beach by
repeatedly subjecting Faragher and other female lifeguards to
`uninvited and offensive touching,` by making lewd remarks, and by
speaking of women in offensive terms. The complaint contained
specific allegations that Terry once said that he would never
promote a woman to the rank of lieutenant, and that Silverman had
said to Faragher, `Date me or clean the toilets for a year.`
Asserting that Terry and Silverman were agents of the city, and
that their conduct amounted to discrimination in the ``terms,
conditions, and privileges'' of her employment, Faragher sought a
judgment against the city for nominal damages, costs, and
attorney's fees. . . .
</P>
<P>
   In February 1986, the city adopted a sexual harassment policy,
which it stated in a memorandum from the city manager addressed to
all employees. In May 1990, the city revised the policy and
reissued a statement of it. Although the city may actually have
circulated the memos and statements to some employees, it
completely failed to disseminate its policy among employees of the
marine safety section, with the result that Terry, Silverman,
Gordon, and many lifeguards were unaware of it.
</P>
<P>
   From time to time over the course of Faragher's tenure at the
marine safety section, between 4 and 6 of the 40 to 50 lifeguards
were women. During that 5-year period, Terry repeatedly touched the
bodies of female employees without invitation would put his arm
around Faragher, with his hand on her buttocks, and once made
contact with another female lifeguard in a motion of sexual
simulation. He made crudely demeaning references to women
generally, and once commented disparagingly on Faragher's shape.
During a job interview with a woman he hired as a lifeguard, Terry
said that the female lifeguards had sex with their male
counterparts and asked whether she would do the same.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Silverman behaved in similar ways. He once tackled Faragher and
remarked that, but for a physical characteristic he found
unattractive, he would readily have had sexual relations with her.
Another time, he pantomimed an act of oral sex. Within earshot of
the female lifeguards, Silverman made frequent, vulgar references
to women and sexual matters, commented on the bodies of female
lifeguards and beachgoers, and at least twice told female
lifeguards that he would like to engage in sex with them. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, ``(i)t shall be
an unlawful employment practice for an employer . . . to fail or
refuse to hire or to discharge any individual, or otherwise to
discriminate against any individual with respect to his
compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment,
because of such individual's race, color, religion, sex, or
national origin.'' We have repeatedly made clear that although the
statute mentions specific employment decisions with immediate
consequences, the scope of the prohibition ``is not limited to
economic or tangible discrimination,'' and that it covers more than
``terms'' and ``conditions'' in the narrow contractual sense. Thus,
in Meritor we held that sexual harassment so ``severe or
pervasive'' as to ``alter the conditions of (the victim's)
employment and create an abusive working environment''' ` violates
Title VII.
</P>
<P>
   In thus holding that environmental claims are covered by the
statute, we drew upon earlier cases recognizing liability for
discriminatory harassment based on race and national origin, just
as we have also followed the lead of such cases in attempting to
define the severity of the offensive conditions necessary to
constitute actionable sex discrimination under the statute.
</P>
<P>
   So, in Harris , we explained that in order to be actionable
under the statute, a sexually objectionable environment must be
both objectively and subjectively offensive, one that a reasonable
person would find hostile or abusive, and one that the victim in
fact did perceive to be so.We directed courts to determine whether
an environment is sufficiently hostile or abusive by ``looking at
all the circumstances,'' including the ``frequency of the
discriminatory conduct; its severity; whether it is physically
threatening or humiliating, or a mere offensive utterance; and
whether it unreasonably interferes with an employee's work
performance.'' Most recently, we explained that Title VII does not
prohibit ``genuine but innocuous differences in the ways men and
women routinely interact with members of the same sex and of the
opposite sex.'' A recurring point in these opinions is that
``simple teasing,'', offhand comments, and isolated incidents
(unless extremely serious) will not amount to discriminatory
changes in the ``terms and conditions of employment.''
</P>
<P>
   These standards for judging hostility are sufficiently demanding
to insure that Title VII does not become a ``general civility
code.'' Properly applied, they will filter out complaints attacking
``the ordinary tribulations of the workplace, such as the sporadic
use of abusive language, gender-related jokes, and occasional
teasing.'' We have made it clear that conduct must be extreme to
amount to a change in the terms and conditions of employment, and
the courts of appeals have heeded this view.
</P>
<P>
   While indicating the substantive contours of the hostile
environments forbidden by Title VII, our cases have established few
definite rules for determining when an employer will be liable for
a discriminatory environment that is otherwise actionably abusive.
Given the circumstances of many of the litigated cases, including
some that have come to us, it is not surprising that in many of
them, the issue has been joined over the sufficiency of the abusive
conditions, not the standards for determining an employer's
liability for them. There have, for example, been myriad cases in
which district courts and courts of appeals have held employers
liable on account of actual knowledge by the employer, or
high-echelon officials of an employer organization, of sufficiently
harassing action by subordinates, which the employer or its
informed officers have done nothing to stop. In such instances, the
combined knowledge and inaction may be seen as demonstrable
negligence, or as the employer's adoption of the offending conduct
and its results, quite as if they had been authorized affirmatively
as the employer's policy. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there is nothing remarkable in the fact that claims
against employers for discriminatory employment actions with
tangible results, like hiring, firing, promotion, compensation, and
work assignment, have resulted in employer liability once the
discrimination was shown. A variety of reasons have been invoked
for this apparently unanimous rule. Some courts explain, in a
variation of the ``proxy'' theory discussed above, that when a
supervisor makes such decisions, he ``merges'' with the employer,
and his act becomes that of the employer. . . .
</P>
<P>
   Faragher points to several ways in which the agency relationship
aided Terry and Silverman in carrying out their harassment. She
argues that in general offending supervisors can abuse their
authority to keep subordinates in their presence while they make
offensive statements, and that they implicitly threaten to misuse
their supervisory powers to deter any resistance or complaint.
Thus, she maintains that power conferred on Terry and Silverman by
the city enabled them to act for so long without provoking defiance
or complaint.
</P>
<P>
   The city, however, contends that 219(2)(d) has no application
here. It argues that the second qualification of the subsection,
referring to a servant `aided in accomplishing the tort by the
existence of the agency relation,` merely `refines` the one
preceding it, which holds the employer vicariously liable for its
servant's abuse of apparent authority. But this narrow reading is
untenable; it would render the second qualification of 219(2)(d)
almost entirely superfluous (and would seem to ask us to shut our
eyes to the potential effects of supervisory authority, even when
not explicitly invoked). The illustrations accompanying this
subsection make clear that it covers not only cases involving the
abuse of apparent authority, but also to cases in which tortious
conduct is made possible or facilitated by the existence of the
actual agency relationship. See Restatement 219 Comment e (noting
employer liability where `the servant may be able to cause harm
because of his position as agent, as where a telegraph operator
sends false messages purporting to come from third persons` and
where the manager who operates a store `for an undisclosed
principal is enabled to cheat the customers because of his
position`); 247, Illustration 1 (noting a newspaper's liability for
a libelous editorial published by an editor acting for his own
purposes).
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   We therefore agree with Faragher that in implementing Title VII
it makes sense to hold an employer vicariously liable for some
tortious conduct of a supervisor made possible by abuse of his
supervisory authority, and that the aided-by-agency-relation
principle embodied in 219(2)(d) of the Restatement provides an
appropriate starting point for determining liability for the kind
of harassment presented here. Several courts, indeed, have noted
what Faragher has argued, that there is a sense in which a
harassing supervisor is always assisted in his misconduct by the
supervisory relationship. The agency relationship affords contact
with an employee subjected to a supervisor's sexual harassment, and
the victim may well be reluctant to accept the risks of blowing the
whistle on a superior. When a person with supervisory authority
discriminates in the terms and conditions of subordinates'
employment, his actions necessarily draw upon his superior position
over the people who report to him, or those under them, whereas an
employee generally cannot check a supervisor's abusive conduct the
same way that she might deal with abuse from a co-worker. When a
fellow employee harasses, the victim can walk away or tell the
offender where to go, but it may be difficult to offer such
responses to a supervisor, whose ``power to supervise-(which may
be) to hire and fire, and to set work schedules and pay rates-does
not disappear . . . when he chooses to harass through insults and
offensive gestures rather than directly with threats of firing or
promises of promotion.'' Recognition of employer liability when
discriminatory misuse of supervisory authority alters the terms and
conditions of a victim's employment is underscored by the fact that
the employer has a greater opportunity to guard against misconduct
by supervisors than by common workers; employers have greater
opportunity and incentive to screen them, train them, and monitor
their performance. . . .
</P>
<P>
   In sum, there are good reasons for vicarious liability for
misuse of supervisory authority. That rationale must, however,
satisfy one more condition. We are not entitled to recognize this
theory under Title VII unless we can square it with Meritor's
holding that an employer is not ``automatically'' liable for
harassment by a supervisor who creates the requisite degree of
discrimination, and there is obviously some tension between that
holding and the position that a supervisor's misconduct aided by
supervisory authority subjects the employer to liability
vicariously; if the `aid` may be the unspoken suggestion of
retaliation by misuse of supervisory authority, the risk of
automatic liability is high. To counter it, we think there are two
basic alternatives, one being to require proof of some affirmative
invocation of that authority by the harassing supervisor, the other
to recognize an affirmative defense to liability in some
circumstances, even when a supervisor has created the actionable
environment.
</P>
<P>
   There is certainly some authority for requiring active or
affirmative, as distinct from passive or implicit, misuse of
supervisory authority before liability may be imputed. That is the
way some courts have viewed the familiar cases holding the employer
liable for discriminatory employment action with tangible
consequences, like firing and demotion. . . . . . .
</P>
<P>
   If the plaintiff unreasonably failed to avail herself of the
employer's preventive or remedial apparatus, she should not recover
damages that could have been avoided if she had done so. If the
victim could have avoided harm, no liability should be found
against the employer who had taken reasonable care, and if damages
could reasonably have been mitigated no award against a liable
employer should reward a plaintiff for what her own efforts could
have avoided.
</P>
<P>
   In order to accommodate the principle of vicarious liability for
harm caused by misuse of supervisory authority, as well as Title
VII's equally basic policies of encouraging forethought by
employers and saving action by objecting employees, we adopt the
following holding in this case and in Burlington Industries Inc. v.
Ellerth, also decided today. An employer is subject to vicarious
liability to a victimized employee for an actionable hostile
environment created by a supervisor with immediate (or successively
higher) authority over the employee. When no tangible employment
action is taken, a defending employer may raise an affirmative
defense to liability or damages, subject to proof by a
preponderance of the evidence. The defense comprises two necessary
elements: (a) that the employer exercised reasonable care to
prevent and correct promptly any sexually harassing behavior, and
(b) that the plaintiff employee unreasonably failed to take
advantage of any preventive or corrective opportunities provided by
the employer or to avoid harm otherwise. While proof that an
employer had promulgated an antiharassment policy with complaint
procedure is not necessary in every instance as a matter of law,
the need for a stated policy suitable to the employment
circumstances may appropriately be addressed in any case when
litigating the first element of the defense. And while proof that
an employee failed to fulfill the corresponding obligation of
reasonable care to avoid harm is not limited to showing an
unreasonable failure to use any complaint procedure provided by the
employer, a demonstration of such failure will normally suffice to
satisfy the employer's burden under the second element of the
defense. No affirmative defense is available, however, when the
supervisor's harassment culminates in a tangible employment action,
such as discharge, demotion, or undesirable reassignment.
</P>
<P>
   Applying these rules here, we believe that the judgment of the
court of appeals must be reversed. The district court found that
the degree of hostility in the work environment rose to the
actionable level and was attributable to Silverman and Terry. It is
undisputed that these supervisors ``were granted virtually
unchecked authority'' over their subordinates, ``directly
controll(ing) and supervis(ing) all aspects of (Faragher's)
day-to-day activities.''. It is also clear that Faragher and her
colleagues were ``completely isolated from the city's higher
management.'' The city did not seek review of these findings.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   While the city would have an opportunity to raise an affirmative
defense if there were any serious prospect of its presenting one,
it appears from the record that any such avenue is closed. The
district court found that the city had entirely failed to
disseminate its policy against sexual harassment among the beach
employees and that its officials made no attempt to keep track of
the conduct of supervisors like Terry and Silverman. The record
also makes clear that the city's policy did not include any
assurance that the harassing supervisors could be bypassed in
registering complaints. Under such circumstances, we hold as a
matter of law that the city could not be found to have exercised
reasonable care to prevent the supervisors' harassing conduct.
Unlike the employer of a small workforce, who might expect that
sufficient care to prevent tortious behavior could be exercised
informally, those responsible for city operations could not
reasonably have thought that precautions against hostile
environments in any one of many departments in far-flung locations
could be effective without communicating some formal policy against
harassment, with a sensible complaint procedure.
</P>
<P>
   We have drawn this conclusion without overlooking two possible
grounds upon which the City might argue for the opportunity to
litigate further. There is, first, the court of appeals's indulgent
gloss on the relevant evidence: ``There is some evidence that the
city did not effectively disseminate among marine safety employees
its sexual harassment policy.'' But, in contrast to the court of
appeals's characterization, the district court made an explicit
finding of a ``complete failure on the part of the city to
disseminate said policy among marine safety section employees.''
The evidence supports the district court's finding and there is no
contrary claim before us.
</P>
<P>
   The second possible ground for pursuing a defense was asserted
by the city in its argument addressing the possibility of
negligence liability in this case. It said that it should not be
held liable for failing to promulgate an anti-harassment policy,
because there was no apparent duty to do so in the 1985-1990
period. The city purports to rest this argument on the position of
the E.E.O.C. during the period mentioned, but it turns out that the
record on this point is quite against the city's position. Although
the E.E.O.C issued regulations dealing with promulgating a
statement of policy and providing a complaint mechanism in 1990,
ever since 1980 its regulations have called for steps to prevent
violations, such as informing employees of their rights and the
means to assert them. The city, after all, adopted an
anti-harassment policy in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   The city points to nothing that might justify a conclusion by
the district court on remand that the city had exercised reasonable
care. Nor is there any reason to remand for consideration of
Faragher's efforts to mitigate her own damages, since the award to
her was solely nominal. . . .
</P>
<P>
   The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit is
reversed, and the case is remanded for reinstatement of the
judgment of the district court.
</P>
<P>
   FROM THE DISSENT
</P>
<P>
   By Justice Thomas
</P>
<P>
   For the reasons given in my dissenting opinion in Burlington
Industries v. Ellerth, absent an adverse employment consequence, an
employer cannot be held vicariously liable if a supervisor creates
a hostile work environment. Petitioner suffered no adverse
employment consequence; thus the court of appeals was correct to
hold that the city is not vicariously liable for the conduct of
Chief Terry and Lieutenant Silverman. Because the Court reverses
this judgment, I dissent.
</P>
<P>
   As for petitioner's negligence claim, the district court made no
finding as to the city's negligence, and the court of appeals did
not directly consider the issue. I would therefore remand the case
to the district court for further proceedings on this question
alone. I disagree with the court's conclusion that merely because
the city did not disseminate its sexual harassment policy, it
should be liable as a matter of law. The city should be allowed to
show either that: (1) there was a reasonably available avenue
through which petitioner could have complained to a city official
who supervised both Chief Terry and Lieutenant Silverman, or (2) it
would not have learned of the harassment even if the policy had
been distributed. Petitioner, as the plaintiff, would of course
bear the burden of proving the city's negligence.

DOUBLE JEOPARDY DOESN'T APPLY TO SENTENCING, COURT RULES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (mk) 
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The constitutional protection against double
jeopardy does not ordinarily apply to criminal sentencing, the
Supreme Court ruled Friday in a decision that removed a legal cloud
from the operation of some states' ``three strikes'' sentencing
laws.
</P>
<P>
   The 5-4 decision, upholding a ruling by the California Supreme
Court, means that a state can have more than one chance to prove
that a previous conviction qualifies as a ``strike'' that counts
against a defendant in calculating an enhanced sentence for a new
offense.
</P>
<P>
   All 50 states have some form of enhanced sentencing for
previously convicted offenders. Had the court ruled that double
jeopardy applied to sentencing, the operation of those laws could
have been placed in doubt to the extent that a state permitted
defendants to contest the validity of an earlier conviction.
</P>
<P>
   In California, a defendant can get a jury trial on the question
of whether a previous conviction qualifies as a ``strike.''
Typically, not every previous offense counts. It must have been a
serious felony that, in the case of an assault, for example,
involved use of a dangerous weapon or great bodily injury to the
victim.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, a man who was convicted of selling marijuana faced
a doubling of his five-year sentence if the state proved that he
had a single prior qualifying conviction. He said that his previous
conviction, an assault in which he had hit someone with a stick,
did not count. The trial judge held that the evidence of the
previous conviction was insufficient.
</P>
<P>
   When the state tried to appeal, the California Court of Appeal
ruled that a new trial on the allegation would amount to double
jeopardy. The California Supreme Court, in turn, reversed that
decision, holding that double jeopardy did not apply to sentencing.
</P>
<P>
   The court Friday affirmed that ruling in an opinion by Justice
Sandra Day O'Connor that was joined by Chief Justice William
Rehnquist and Justices Anthony Kennedy, Clarence Thomas and Stephen
Breyer.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor said that historically, double jeopardy applied only to
a determination of guilt or innocence, not sentencing. She noted
that in 1981, the court had made an exception to that rule in a
death penalty case, Bullington vs. Missouri, in which a murder
defendant who had received a life sentence got a new trial in
which, if found guilty, he faced a renewed chance of being
sentenced to death. The court ruled then that a defendant who had
avoided the death penalty in an initial sentencing proceeding could
not be forced to face it again in a resentencing.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor said Friday that the decision in the Bullington case
had depended on the ``unique circumstances'' of the death penalty
and should not be extended to other types of sentencing.
</P>
<P>
   In a dissenting opinion, Antonin Scalia said he agreed with the
conclusion that the Bullington case should not be extended. But he
said that the current case, Monge vs. California, No. 97-6146,
should not be regarded as a simple sentencing case. Rather, he
said, a sentencing enhancement was in effect a conviction for a
separate crime, for which full procedural protections should apply.
Justices David Souter and Ruth Bader Ginsburg joined Scalia's
dissent, while Justice John Paul Stevens dissented separately.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate case Friday, the court refused without comment to
hear a constitutional challenge to a federal law, the Military
Honor and Decency Act of 1996, which prohibits the government from
selling or renting ``sexually explicit material'' on military
property. The effect of the law is to bar the rental of sexually
explicit films and the sale of such popular magazines as Penthouse
and Playboy _ previously sold by the hundreds of thousands of
copies a year _ from the PX on a military base.
</P>
<P>
   The publisher of Penthouse, along with other plaintiffs, brought
a First Amendment suit against the law and won an initial ruling in
U.S. District Court in New York. But late last year, the 2nd U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals held that the law was constitutional as a
reasonable restriction on speech in the particular context of a
military base.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court appeal, General Media Communications Inc. vs.
Cohen, No. 97-1535, said the law, and the ruling upholding it,
``will result in massive restriction of the First Amendment rights
of our country's military personnel and their dependents.''
</P>
<P>
   Military personnel may still own sexually explicit material and
may buy it from sources other than the PX.

GIULIANI PLANS CUTS DESPITE BUDGET SURPLUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MIKE ALLEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Despite others' projections of a hefty budget surplus
next year, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said Friday that he plans $427
million in cuts to counteract what he called overspending by the
city council.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials asserted that the cuts, from a budget
of $34 billion, would be felt by few New Yorkers. The officials
said some of the savings would be realized through efficiencies
that would barely be noticed _ for instance, by reducing overtime
payments. But in other cases, the officials acknowledged, the cuts
are likely to come from the council's additions to the mayor's
proposed budget.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani has denounced many of these additions, made at the
behest of individual members, as shameless pork. The new budget
year begins Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani made the announcement at the annual meeting of the
State Financial Control Board, which has overseen the city's
financial management since the fiscal crisis of 1975.
</P>
<P>
   Although most of Friday's reports were accounts that the city
was financially flush, Giuliani said his $427 million in spending
reductions would protect the city even if the current boom fades.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest mistakes the city has made in the past, in the 70s
and in the 80s, were at times when the economy was booming,''
Giuliani said. ``It was in those times that rather than seriously
restraining the urge to spend every penny, the city outspent the
growth of its economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Lhota, the mayor's budget director, said memos would be
sent next week to the heads of city agencies, asking them to
propose cuts that would meet a chosen target. Giuliani will review
the proposed reductions, Lhota said.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani had been keeping the council in suspense about how he
would curb spending ever since the council overrode his vetoes of
some items in the 1998-99 budget, which the council passed without
his agreement on June 5.
</P>
<P>
   Although the council passes the budget, it is the mayor who
spends the money, and even if his vetoes are overridden he can
still order spending cuts. At first he threatened to refuse to
spend money allocated in the budget, which would probably have
resulted in a court fight with the council. But his aides said the
cuts would make that unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   Council Speaker Peter Vallone said the council would fight any
budget cuts that ``end up hurting valuable services and people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The mayor's math just doesn't add up,'' Vallone said. ``We
have a $2 billion surplus, but he still wants to cut agency
spending.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani has sparred with the Financial Control Board in the
past, but Friday's meeting was all mutual congratulations. The
board's chairman is Gov. George E. Pataki, who opened the meeting
but then departed unexpectedly, without explanation to the mayor,
before Giuliani began speaking.
</P>
<P>
   First, though, Pataki praised Giuliani for the city's balanced
budgets and record surpluses. The men, both Republicans, have had a
frosty relationship that has seemed to warm up in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mayor, I think we should all be very, very proud and grateful
for the record of accomplishment over the course of the last five
years,'' the governor said.
</P>
<P>
   Two Democrats on the Financial Control Board, Alan Hevesi and H.
Carl McCall, also had praise for Giuliani. Hevesi, the city
comptroller, said the city was should finish this budget year with
a surplus of about $2.2 billion, and should have a surplus next
year of $576 million to $806 million.
</P>
<P>
   McCall, the state comptroller, said he expected the city to end
this budget year with a surplus of $2.1 billion and have ``a
significant surplus'' next year. But he warned that the budget
discord ``threatens to distract the city from making headway on
pressing long-term budget issues.''

 &HT;    CHINESE CANNONS BOOM OUT TIANANMEN SQUARE SALUTE TO CLINTON

<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ His face somber, President Bill Clinton stood mute
Saturday as cannons of the Peoples' Liberation Army roared out a
21-gun Chinese welcome of honor in flag-decked Tiananmen Square.
</P>
<P>
   This was the television picture China had hungered for, the
visible evidence that the world's last remaining superpower, the
United States, was finally looking beyond the searing memories of
500 to 1,000 unarmed Chinese protesters massacred on the access
roads to Tiananmen nine years ago.
</P>
<P>
   With a big American flag fluttering on the flagpole in front of
the Great Hall of the People, a Chinese People's Liberation Army
(PLA) band struck up the Star Spangled Banner. Then at six-second
intervals, the Chinese army guns boomed from the center of the
98-acre square Mao Tse-tung cleared in the mid-1950s for military
parades and million-person mass mobilizations.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who was just two years old when Mao came to power in
1949, stood at attention looking eminently presidential in a dark
blue suit and dark golden tie. Beside him stood a beaming President
Jiang Zemin, and in the background the two first ladies, Hillary
Rodham Clinton and Wang Yepin.
</P>
<P>
   After the last strain of the American anthem, the band launched
into ``Onward Righteous and Brave Army,'' the anthem of the
People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
   Then Clinton and Jiang set off on foot along a five-minute
rectangular walking route along a red carpet as they reviewed an
honor guard of troops from the Chinese army, navy and air force. By
then, Clinton's initial sober, almost blank expression had given
way to an occasional grin as the smiling Jiang -- who stands a full
head shorter than Clinton -- carried out a running dialog in
English with the American president.
</P>
<P>
   They were cheered by about 200 Beijing-based American students,
teachers, businessmen and embassy workers who had been given
credentials for the event. The American contingent far outnumbered
the top-level Chinese who were in attendance.
</P>
<P>
   Never in the five-and-a- half-years of his presidency has
Clinton stirred such powerful passions by performing a purely
ceremonial act, and the pained reactions from 1989 Tiananmen
survivors is surely far from finished.
</P>
<P>
   Just three weeks ago, the 35-year-old Hong Kong labor activist
and Tiananmen survivor Han Dongfang said, ``I hope when Clinton
stands there and walks in front of the army, he can hear the
shooting and the people crying and see a picture of the blood in
his mind.''
</P>
<P>
   The closest Clinton has come to describing his thoughts about
the welcoming ceremony came eight days ago. As Clinton sat in the
Oval Office preparing to leave for China, a correspondent asked him
what he would be pondering as his motorcade pulled up to the Great
Hall of the People.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, obviously I want to see Tiananmen Square,'' Clinton
replied, ``and I will think about what happened there nine years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I also will be thinking about the last turbulent century
in Chinese history and the fact that whole setting there has been
the center of Chinese public life for probably 600 years now.''
</P>
<P>
   The setting for the Chinese welcome was a football-sized stone
courtyard in front of the Great Hall of the People, the gigantic
columned structure on the western edge of the world's largest
public square. The building, propped up by a dozen 80-foot-tall
gray marble columns, was built in 11 months by a legion of
``volunteers'' back in 1959.
</P>
<P>
   Following the welcoming ceremony, Clinton and Jiang ascended a
red carpeted stone staircase leading into the Great Hall for a day
of private talks.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional trim begins.)
</P>
<P>
   Despite the symbolism of an emerging friendship, the opening of
talks was overshadowed on Friday by an unexpected row over China's
detention of dissidents.
</P>
<P>
   A big chill suddenly arose 24 hours earlier, during what was
supposed to be a low-pressure day of presidential sightseeing in
the ancient Chinese capital of Xi'an. When news reports told of
three or four Chinese dissidents arrested on the day of Clinton's
arrival, the White House reacted with harsh words.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are not debris to be swept up for a visitor, and we
have expressed our concern about this to the Chinese government,''
National Security Adviser Sam uel ``Sandy'' Berger told reporters
before the presidential entourage flew to Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unacceptable . . . for people to be detained in
connection with an event like this,'' Berger added. He predicted
that Clinton would pass on the same message Saturday in private
talks with Chinese President Jiang Zemin.
</P>
<P>
   A Chinese foreign ministry spokesman angrily denied that anyone
had been ``arrested,'' but left open the possibility that some
potential protesters may have been held in Xi'an for questioning
during the Clinton visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are opposed to any foreign country using the human rights
issue as a pretext to interfere in China's internal affairs,'' the
foreign ministry spokesman said late Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Once Clinton's airplane left Xi'an, Chinese authorities released
two of the local activists who had reportedly been held in custody.
One, 29-year-old Yang Hai, insisted he had been ``kidnapped'' by
police to bar him from meeting with foreign television journalists.
</P>
<P>
   With the Americans and Chinese entourages in disagreement about
the facts of the Xi'an detentions, Clinton gave a more guarded
reaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found the reports disturbing,'' he said. ``If true, they
represent not China at its best and not China looking forward but
looking backward.''

IMMIGRANT LAYS HIS DEPORTATION CHARGES TO HIS EX-WIFE 
</HEADLINE>
  (ja) 
 By JOHN KIFNER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the eyes of the FBI, Hany Kiareldeen is a Palestinian
terrorist who helped plot the World Trade Center bombing and
planned to kill Attorney General Janet Reno.
</P>
<P>
   But to his family and his lawyers, he is the victim of a
vengeful former wife and the vagaries of immigration law.
</P>
<P>
   Kiareldeen, the 30-year-old manager of an electronics store in
Passaic, N.J., has been locked up in the Mercer County Jail by the
Immigration and Nationalization Service since March and is awaiting
deportation hearings that could send him back to his native Gaza
Strip.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, he was charged with having overstayed the student
visa with which he entered the country eight years ago. His family
concedes that he used to attend classes at Rutgers University and
Essex County Community College, but had not done so for four years.
But, they said, he applied in October to become a permanent
resident after his marriage Aug. 28 to an American citizen, Carmen
Negron.
</P>
<P>
   In the normal course of events, experts familiar with
immigration practices said, he would have probably been released
and eventually approved for residency.
</P>
<P>
   But at a bail hearing on April 10, the Newark office of the FBI
submitted a nonclassified summary of a report saying its Joint
Terrorism Task Force had information that Kiareldeen had made ``a
credible threat'' against the attorney general and that an
investigation had revealed that he had ``relationships with others
suspected of membership in terrorist organizations dedicated to
committing acts of violence against the people of the United States
or its allies.'' Bail was denied.
</P>
<P>
   Then, at an immigration hearing on Thursday, the FBI produced a
somewhat longer, four-paragraph summary that said its ``multiple
reliable sources'' _ who were not named _ had given information
that he not only maintained relationships with suspected terrorists
and planned to kill Reno, but that he had held a meeting at his
home in Nutley, N.J., at which Nidal Ayyad, a convicted
co-conspirator in the Islamic fundamentalist plot, discussed the
bombing of the World Trade Center a week before it took place.
</P>
<P>
   The summary said, ``Recently, a source advised Hany expressed a
desire to murder Attorney General Janet Reno for her role in the
conviction of those responsible for the bombing of the World Trade
Center.''
</P>
<P>
   It added: ``A source advised Hany stated in the presence of
others that they, including himself, must kill Janet Reno.
Furthermore, Hany stated that an additional person would assist in
the murder of the Attorney General. The FBI took additional steps
to test the veracity of the source reporting the threat against the
Attorney General.''
</P>
<P>
   A Justice Department spokesman said Ms. Reno's office and
security detail were aware of the case but he did not know whether
Ms. Reno herself was aware of the purported threat.
</P>
<P>
   Kiareldeen's brother, Ghassen Khaireldin, who transliterates his
name from Arabic differently, said Friday that he was shocked by
the accusations and suggested that federal agents had been deceived
by his brother's former wife. ``Hany is not religious, he's a
secular guy, and he is extremely nonpolitical,'' Khaireldin said.
``He has been here for eight years and he has never even gone to a
mosque.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Kiareldeen's brother and his wife, in separate interviews,
said they believed that his arrest and the FBI charges were the
result of a vendetta by Kiareldeen's first wife, the former Amal
Mohamed, an Egyptian. The Kiareldeens were divorced last June, and
she had filed more than a half-dozen charges of abuse against him
in New Jersey courts, all of which, family members and lawyers
said, were dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to find the first wife last night were unsuccessful.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer handling the immigration appeal, Regis Fernandez,
said the use of classified evidence complicated Kiareldeen's case
``How do we rebut this evidence if we don't know what it is?'' he
asked. ``Due process is being swept aside because he's an
immigrant.''
</P>
<P>
   The FBI's Newark office said through a spokeswoman that it would
not provide any additional information. No criminal charges have
been brought against Kiareldeen, however, and a Justice Department
official in Washington said it appeared unlikely that any would be.

RULING BROADENS COVERAGE OF DISABILITY ACT, ADVOCATES SAY
</HEADLINE>
   (See related stories: SCOTUS-HARASS, SCOTUS-HARASS-REACT,

(ja) 
 By PETER T. KILBORN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Millions of Americans with conditions like
diabetes, epilepsy and even infertility and alcohol addiction
appear to have won important new protection against discrimination
as a result of a Wednesday Supreme Court ruling, advocates say.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling came in the case of a woman who had HIV but no
symptoms of the condition.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for both employers and people with chronic health
conditions interpreted the decision, which came in the court's
first broad look at the 1990 Americans With Disabilities Act, as
saying that the act protects people without obvious symptoms, just
as it covers those who are blind or use wheelchairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``They sent a very strong signal to the lower courts saying that
the ADA is meant to be interpreted broadly as to who is affected by
the act,'' said Arlene Mayerson, directing attorney for the
Disability Rights Education and Defense Fund in Berkeley, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Bokat, chief counsel for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce,
said the ruling ``just throws the statute wide open.'' Roger Pilon,
director of the libertarian Cato Institute's Center for
Constitutional Studies, added: ``It's not a result I'm happy with.
We like doors to be opened by consent, not by the force of law.''
</P>
<P>
   On its face, the case looks quite narrow. Sidney Abbott of
Bangor, Me., complained that her dentist, Randon Bragdon, had
discriminated against her by refusing to treat her because she has
the virus that causes AIDS. While she has no symptoms, she argued
that she was covered under the act because she is effectively
infertile. She does not want to have children because of the risk
of passing the virus on to them.
</P>
<P>
   In a 5-4 ruling, the justices agreed with a federal appeals
court's ruling that her condition met the act's definition of
disability because it limited a ``major life activity.'' The court
did not take the next step and rule that the virus is actually
covered by the act, but analysts said the ruling implies that it
is.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't just about dentists' chairs,'' said Matthew Coles,
director of the American Civil Liberties Union's AIDS Project.
``Its about everything the Americans With Disabilities Act
covers,'' he said, including employment, public accommodations and
the services of state and local governments.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Greene, chairman of the American Diabetes Association's
legal advocacy committee, explained the importance of the ruling to
people like himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had insulin-dependent diabetes for 18 years,'' he said.
``You couldn't tell from looking at me that I have a noncurable,
major disease. In that sense I'm similar to an HIV person who's
nonsymptomatic.
</P>
<P>
   ``This case emphasizes what the ADA is about _ that people need
to be treated fairly unless the disease really presents or creates
an inability to do a job.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus, Greene said, a worker with diabetes can't be denied a job
or a promotion because of an employer's fear, based on ignorance,
that the worker might have a coma _ or his discomfort with the
worker's need to eat regularly, to test his blood sugar and to give
himself insulin shots. The ruling means that the employer must
accommodate those needs, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The same applies to the nation's estimated 6 million couples who
are infertile, said Deborah Wachenheim, director of government
affairs for the National Infertility Association in Somerville,
Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court defined reproduction as a major life activity,'' she
said, so an employer who restricts a worker's need for treatment is
guilty of discrimination. She said the decision requires employers
to accommodate infertile workers with adjustments in their work
schedules when they are undergoing fertility treatments.
</P>
<P>
   Coles of the ACLU said the ruling was especially important in
shifting the course of earlier rulings by lower courts. ``Most of
the courts have been giving extremely technical readings of the act
and restricting the reach of the act,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the litigation,'' Coles said, ``has not focused on
whether people could do jobs, but on their disabilities.
Yesterday's decision was striking because it does not take that
approach at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the Americans With Disabilities Act applies to public
accommodations and to state and local services, Mary Ann Gleason,
executive director of the National Coalition for the Homeless, said
the ruling also provides protection for homeless people, who often
have disabilities arising from mental disorders or substance abuse.
</P>
<P>
   She said she believes the ruling prohibits landlords from
turning away applicants for government-subsidized housing because
of drug or alcohol addiction.

SORENSTAM, FOUR OTHERS SHARE FIRST-ROUND LEAD
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By ALEX YANNIS     
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABSECON, N.J. _ After finishing second last year and third in
1996, Annika Sorenstam of Sweden again is challenging for the title
in the $1 million ShopRite LPGA Classic, the richest three-day on
the tour.
</P>
<P>
   Sorenstam, the top woman golfer in the world last year, shot a
five-under 66 Friday at the Seaview Marriott's renovated Bay Course
to share the first-round lead with Tina Barrett, Alicia Dibos of
Peru, Caroline McMillan of England and a qualifier Moira Dunn.
While Sorenstam has 15 victories in five years on the tour, the
four who share the lead with Sorenstam have combined for two
victories in a total of 31 years on the tour.
</P>
<P>
   Betsy King, the two-time winner of the event and a member of the
Hall of Fame, was a shot behind at 67. She was tied with with seven
others, including Julie Inkster, another two-time winner of this
tournament, which returned here this season after 11 years at
Somers Point.
</P>
<P>
   Sorenstam, who lost the tournament last year because Michelle
McGann shot 64 on the final day, had no bogeys and five birdies on
the 6,024-yard course. The course is rather short by LPGA
standards, but it is challenging because of high fescue and small,
undulating greens.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some short par 4's, but it's a links course and I
had some super saves,'' Sorenstam said. ``I'm very pleased with my
game. It's good to see that my momentum from St. Louis is still
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Barrett attributed part of her success to switching putters for
the first time in eight years. She birdied four holes with putts
longer than 15 feet, but she also three-putted the last hole from
30 feet for her only bogey of the day.
</P>
<P>
   Barrett's lone victory on the tour came in her rookie season in
1989. She started the season fairly well, but she has been in a
funk for the last month or so. Barrett's 66 matched her best round
of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Dibos' 66 is her best round this season and it came on five
birdies and no bogeys, while McMillan's round included six birdies
and a bogey. She has been without a victory since her triumph in
the JAL Big Apple Classic two years ago. &QL;

MARKETSPAN FORMS PANEL TO DEAL WITH LILCO FUROR 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By BRUCE LAMBERT    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   GARDEN CITY, N.Y. _ Facing a mounting array of investigations
and lawsuits, Marketspan's board Friday appointed a special
committee to deal with all litigation arising from $67 million in
payments made to its executives who were at Long Island Lighting
Co.
</P>
<P>
   The decision was intended to prevent the board from being
preoccupied by the compensation issue. It was also intended to
refocus the board's attention on the reorganization and expansion
of Marketspan, which was formed by the merger of part of LILCO with
Brooklyn Union Gas and its affiliates.
</P>
<P>
   Marketspan's first board meeting, on June 10, was devoted
entirely to the compensation issue and was held in a crisis
atmosphere. Gov. George Pataki had demanded the removal of Dr.
William Catacosinos as Marketspan's chairman for having taken $42
million in payments when he was chairman of LILCO. An additional
$25 million was paid to 25 other executives.
</P>
<P>
   Saying that he has the support of major stockholders,
Catacosinos has refused to quit and Friday presided at the board's
second session.
</P>
<P>
   After the board's four-hour meeting, Marketspan released a
statement announcing the creation of the special committee to deal
with the executive compensation issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The special committee will have full authority to make any and
all decisions related to these matters,'' Marketspan said in the
statement.
</P>
<P>
   Marketspan was created on May 28 as the Long Island Power
Authority, a state agency, took over LILCO's electricity service.
The remainder of LILCO merged with the Brooklyn Union group to form
the new company. Marketspan is operating the old LILCO electricity
system under a contract with the power authority.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki had promoted the partial takeover as a way to deliver a
20 percent cut in electricity bills that, under LILCO, has been the
highest in the continental United States.
</P>
<P>
   But a week after the takeover and merger, Pataki angrily
disclosed the executive payments, which he said violated the
state's agreement with LILCO barring layoffs and severance pay.
Neither Catacosinos nor the 25 other executives missed a day's pay,
and all of them automatically assumed new positions at Marketspan.
</P>
<P>
   Catacosinos and Marketspan's president, Robert Catell, who was
Brooklyn Union's chairman, hold their new jobs under an arrangement
approved by the stockholders of their old companies, and they also
serve at the pleasure of the new board.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's press office declined to comment on Catacosinos'
continuation as head of the new company.
</P>
<P>
   Marketspan's other executive appointments are interim and have
not yet been ratified by the new board.
</P>
<P>
   The former LILCO executives contend that their payments were for
retirement and other benefits they were entitled to under personal
contracts that were properly disclosed in the agreements with the
state, although the exact amounts of the payments were not
specified. They say that the state's representatives did not object
to the planned payments until now.
</P>
<P>
   Marketspan's directors had already hired a law firm in
Manhattan, Simpson Thacher &AMP; Bartlett, to review the compensation
issue, and that firm will now advise the board's new committee.
</P>
<P>
   The committee's members are Edward Miller, who served on the
board of Brooklyn Union's holding company; Frederic Salerno, who
was chosen by the LILCO side, and Vincent Tese, a new director
chosen jointly by both sides.
</P>
<P>
   So far, 11 lawsuits have been filed by shareholders seeking to
overturn the executive payments. The Suffolk County Legislature has
scheduled a vote for Tuesday on authorizing a lawsuit seeking to
nullify the payments and recoup the money.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The compensation issue is also being investigated by the power
authority, the state attorney general, the state public service
commission, the state assembly and the federal Energy Regulatory
Commission.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the federal Securities and Exchange Commission,
which enforces rules on the disclosure of compensation, said its
policy is to not comment on whether it has a pending investigation.
</P>
<P>
   State Attorney General Dennis Vacco's investigation was
criticized Friday by Eliot Spitzer, who is seeking the Democratic
nomination to run against Vacco, a Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer said Vacco should be disqualified for a conflict of
interest because he was involved in the takeover proceedings, and
for ineptitude for having failed to uncover the executive
compensation in the takeover agreements.
</P>
<P>
   But Vacco's spokesman, Christopher McKenna denied the
accusations, saying, ``It's ridiculous.'' &QL;

Rockets, Barkley make part of franchise's future feel at home
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By EDDIE SEFKO &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
A few bridges to the future joined the Rockets' family Friday, and
for Michael Dickerson, bringing the Rockets into the next
generation is particularly challenging.
</P>
<P>
   But somebody has to follow Clyde Drexler, so the shooting guard
from Arizona figures it might as well be him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought about that,'' said Dickerson, who celebrated his
23rd birthday Thursday. ``Obviously, I'm not a Clyde Drexler, a
Hall of Famer. But I feel like I can come in and give the coaches
what they want. They need penetration and outside shooting and just
to have some of the pressure taken off of Charles (Barkley) and
Hakeem (Olajuwon).
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to disappoint anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the prevailing theme among the three guards and one
forward who were drafted by the Rockets on Wednesday and introduced
at their practice facility Friday. Joining Dickerson were guards
Bryce Drew and Cuttino Mobley, as well as Turkish forward Mirsad
Turkcan.
</P>
<P>
   Dickerson was taken 14th, Valparaiso's Drew 16th and Turkcan
18th in the first round. Mobley, from Rhode Island, was taken in
the second round at No. 41 overall.
</P>
<P>
   Drexler, who coaches the University of Houston men's basketball
team, leaves a large void, to be sure. And the Rockets won't expect
one player, let alone a rookie, to take up all of the slack.
</P>
<P>
   But neither are the Rockets downplaying the potential possessed
by Dickerson.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Rudy Tomjanovich said he's looking forward to the 6-5
Dickerson creating his own legacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't get caught up in those kind of things,'' Tomjanovich
said of Dickerson replacing Drexler. ``You have to be who you are,
and he's pretty good.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clyde is a player who did so much for basketball for Houston,
and it's not fair to put that kind of a burden on a young player. I
feel confident that he's an all-around player, that he's going to
find his own niche in the NBA and in 10 years people are going to
be talking about what a great player Michael Dickerson is.''
</P>
<P>
   Dickerson has a high school national championship and an NCAA
title. That puts him in elite company. But he says he would like to
complete the hat trick and get a ring at the NBA level, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they said Magic (Johnson) is one of the only guys who
has won the high school, the college and the NBA titles,''
Dickerson said. ``So hopefully, I'll try to do that too. So I'm
looking forward to winning a championship. Obviously, we have the
players to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though Olajuwon and Barkley are in the twilight of their
careers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charles called and was joking that he was on his last legs,''
said Dickerson, who might not have understood Barkley could have
been serious. ``I'm just glad that he feels like we can come in and
help.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last night, I spent two hours talking to him, and I already
love him.''
</P>
<P>
   Barkley made telephone calls to all of the Rockets' new recruits
in the hours after they were drafted. As always, he made an
impression.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was sitting in the house with my mother, and Charles Barkley
called,'' Mobley said. ``He said, `Hey, Cuttino,' And I was
wondering, `Who is this?' He said he was Charles Barkley and was
just calling to congratulate me. And I said, `Oh, how you doing,
Mr. Barkley?'
</P>
<P>
   ``I was like a kid in the candy store. Just to be playing with
Charles Barkley and Hakeem Olajuwon I mean, you practice their
moves on playgrounds, and now you're going to play with them. I'm
just flabbergasted.
</P>
<P>
   ``He called me and Michael his two sons.''
</P>
<P>
   Adding four youngsters to the Rockets' roster, along with
second-year man Rodrick Rhodes, means the transformation has begun
in earnest. The Rockets are getting younger. And they're doing so
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``This might be the biggest offseason for us since the year we
added Hakeem Olajuwon,'' Tomjanovich said. ``We feel this is a
crucial time for this franchise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Step one was the draft. These guys not only complement the
veterans we have in Charles and Hakeem, but they are the foundation
for the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Tomjanovich called Dickerson ``the best athlete in the draft,''
and the coach believes the 6-3 Drew is the sort of point guard who
will be perfect for the Rockets.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a player that everybody got to know during the NCAA
Tournament with his heroics (a last-second shot to beat
Mississippi),'' Tomjanovich said. ``But we were watching him
throughout the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very good with the basketball, good on the pick-and-rolls
and can create his own shot. We also see him as being one of the
best shooters with range in this draft.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Dickerson and Mobley, Drew got a call from Barkley the
night of the draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just said, `Mr. Barkley, I don't know what to say,''' said
Drew, who added Barkley, a free agent, gave indications he would be
back with the Rockets. ``He'd better come back. He's going to have
four rookies really upset if he doesn't come back.''
</P>
<P>
   And once the younger players get over the urge to call them
``Mr.,'' they plan on benefiting by having a couple of future Hall
of Famers with whom to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to learn so much this year,'' Drew said. ``But on
the other hand, we want to contribute as much as we can and
hopefully get back to the playoffs and see what we can do.''

on sexual harassment in the workplace today, making some lawsuits
against employers easier to win while limiting the legal exposure
of companies that have effective anti-harassment policies in place.

contradictory lower-court rulings that had grown up in the 12 years
since the Justices first ruled that sexual harassment was a form of
employment discrimination. By Linda Greenhouse.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   CONGRESS-HEALTH-ASSESS (Washington) _ In unveiling a health plan
to patch up managed care with such measures as expanding a
patient's ability to choose a doctor and to receive emergency care,
were House GOP leaders simply providing political cover for the
November elections, or genuinely trying to pass a law to address
patients' concerns? The answer, say close associates of Speaker
Newt Gingrich, is both. By Lizette Alvarez.
</P>
<P>
   SCOTUS-DISABILITY-REACT (Washington) _ _ Millions of Americans
with conditions like diabetes, epilepsy and even infertility and

TRUSTEES FORCE RETIREMENT ON ECCENTRIC HEADMASTER OF HARLEM SCHOOL
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By SOMINI SENGUPTA     
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Thirty-two years ago, an eccentric poet named Ned
O'Gorman hatched a neighborhood preschool inside a battered Harlem
storefront and tended it as it grew into a private, tuition-free
academy from prekindergarten through eighth grade. Since then, he
has taught his charges to read Greek and perform Shakespeare,
escorted some of them to exclusive prep schools and buried others
in early graves.
</P>
<P>
   Now the trustees who run the Children's Storefront school, which
is housed in three brownstones on East 129th Street between Park
and Madison Avenues, say they want a new headmaster, one who will
introduce a more rigorous curriculum and build the school's
endowment. After unsuccessfully pressing O'Gorman to step down for
years, the 24-member board voted this week to force him to take a
sabbatical beginning on Wednesday and then retire in 1999. This
ouster has unleashed an unusual and emotional response.
</P>
<P>
   O'Gorman says he will leave the school, but will rent a room on
the street, pack it with a few books, perhaps serve hot chocolate
to the pupils in winter, and just be there for the children.
</P>
<P>
   ``So the kids don't feel like I've just gotten up and
disappeared,'' he explained. ``I must be where the kids and
teachers can come to see me. I've been on that street for 32 years
every bloody day!''
</P>
<P>
   Parents have planned a rally in front of the school Saturday in
his support.
</P>
<P>
   The trustees said several factors prompted them to take the
action: the need for an orderly succession and for an increase in
the endowment and O'Gorman's broken promises to retire. Two years
ago, for example, O'Gorman had set a retirement date for this June,
but then reneged, said the board president, Christine LaSala.
Ultimately, she said, the trustees felt compelled to set a firm
departure date.
</P>
<P>
   ``The board had grappled with an open-ended time frame for a
long time,'' said Ms. LaSala, who is also the managing director of
J &AMP; H Marsh &AMP; McLennan, the insurance company. ``It couldn't
grapple with an open-ended time frame any longer.''
</P>
<P>
   The board plans to appoint an interim head this fall and select
a permanent successor by next year. Ms. LaSala said she could not
comment on O'Gorman's plan to set up a post on East 129th Street,
except to say that the board would not seek to ``exile Ned from the
school.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't prevent him from exercising his basic human
freedoms,'' she said. ``What I am saying is that the management of
the school will not be in the hands of Ned O'Gorman in September
1998.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, O'Gorman said the members of the board, many of
whom are corporate executives, ousted him because they could no
longer tolerate what he described as his ``poetic inability to
contain myself.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a very short temper,'' he said Thursday. ``I tend not
to be, what do you say, acquiescent to the trustees. I don't care
about the trustees; I care about the kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel,'' he added, ``I must make vital decisions about the
school without consulting the trustees.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Gorman, who was inspired by the radical Brazilian philosopher
Paulo Freire to try to empower the poor through education, said he
had had different plans for a succession: He and the parents would
help to select the next headmaster, with whom he would work for a
year before easing himself out. He said he had long ago issued a
retirement date _ he says he does not remember exactly when _ but
rescinded it after the board publicized his departure without
consulting him.
</P>
<P>
   Several trustees interviewed this week said it had been
impossible to build the school's endowment, now a little over $3
million, without a successor. Would-be donors, they said, simply
wanted evidence that the school could survive without O'Gorman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I analogize it to a start-up company _ until it has grown
enough to be a survivor, it's a very risky proposition,'' said a
trustee, Robert Rylee. ``It shouldn't be shocking, surprising or
anything. It's sort of standard corporate management _ planning for
the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. LaSala said the school, which has 155 students and an annual
operating budget of $1.8 billion, also needed to strengthen
students' computer skills and to shore up the math and science
curriculum. With O'Gorman, she said, ``it was hard to make changes
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   When told of the trustees' plans to revamp the curriculum,
O'Gorman groaned. He said he feared for the neediest pupils _ ``the
devastated children'' he called them, ``who are the basis, the soil
of our school.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I fear for the straightening of the Storefront,'' he said.
``It's a crooked little place, you know.''
</P>
<P>
   While the retirement mandate seems most painful for O'Gorman,
who has been synonymous with the Children's Storefront since he
established it in 1966, it has also wrenched the parents, who have
one representative on the board.
</P>
<P>
   One parent, Brian Jacobs, said he was shocked to learn of the
board's decision. He said he had been relying on O'Gorman's
assistance and considerable contacts with private schools for help
in choosing a high school for his 13-year-old daughter, Jasmine,
who is to graduate from the Storefront next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been counting on Ned being around for this,'' he said.
``This is a very important year for these eighth graders _ and to
have the school caught up in this turmoil.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he had long known of O'Gorman's prickly relationship
with the trustees, but said the ouster would bring only turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ned is eccentric to say the least, but his heart is in the
right place,'' Jacobs added. ``Ned is not going to be plucked from
it and go quietly.''

MAYOR'S SUPPORT OF GOVERNOR'S RIVAL MUDDLES ALABAMA RACE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By KEVIN SACK   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BIRMINGHAM, Ala. _ As if Alabama's Republican gubernatorial race
has not been odd enough, the campaign between Gov. Fob James Jr.
and Winton Blount III has been dominated in its final week by the
possibility that it may be decided by Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday night, one week before the June 30 runoff, Mayor
Richard Arrington Jr. of Birmingham, a Democrat who has been
elected five times, announced that his powerful get-out-the-vote
machine was supporting Blount. Although Tuesday's contest is a
runoff for the Republican nomination, it is open to voters
regardless of party.
</P>
<P>
   The endorsement by Arrington, who is black, has added a racial
element to a campaign that has already encountered questions about
body shape, inherited wealth and a deadly car wreck, along with the
customary accusations of lying and underhandedness. Polls show that
the race is close, and the prospect for crossover voting has made
it utterly unpredictable.
</P>
<P>
   Because James, 63, is a defiant defender of religious expression
in schools and other public places, the election is considered a
critical test of the voting strength of Christian conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   The governor took a break from campaigning on Wednesday to fly
to Dallas, at state expense, to address an institute for Christian
missionaries. On Thursday night, in the last of four televised
debates, James asserted that ``this country at one time was a
Christian nation'' because Americans recognized that the
Constitution was founded on Judeo-Christian principles. A recent
James television advertisement features a tribute by the wife of a
judge who displays a tablet of the Ten Commandments in his
courtroom and who has been defended by James.
</P>
<P>
   Blount, 54, has stressed that he, too, supports returning prayer
to the schools. But he maintains that governor James has
embarrassed the state by threatening to defy Supreme Court rulings
on the question.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have grown concerned over the campaign's negative
tone, worrying that the obvious beneficiary will be the Democratic
nominee, Lt. Gov. Don Siegelman. When Blount was slapping backs at
a seniors center in Huntsville on Thursday, Robert Thibeault, a
65-year-old retired engineer, asked the candidate, ``Why are you
fellows cutting one another?''
</P>
<P>
   Blount, a wealthy Montgomery businessman and longtime party
loyalist, quickly blamed James. But the attacks continued in the
Thursday night debate, which ended with a tit-for-tat about which
candidate was the most deceitful.
</P>
<P>
   In explaining the unprecedented endorsement by his Jefferson
County Citizens Coalition, Arrington said the group was still
likely to support Siegelman in the general election on Nov. 3. But
the mayor said he wanted to influence the Republican nomination
because he had not been pleased with James' treatment of his city
and that he hoped to provide Birmingham voters with ``the best of
both worlds.''
</P>
<P>
   The Citizens Coalition has set a goal of turning out 40,000 of
Jefferson County's 360,000 registered voters, of whom 115,000 are
black. Only 25,000 votes separated James and Blount in the
five-candidate primary on June 2, when James finished with 48
percent of the vote to Blount's 41 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Many politicians and strategists question whether it will be
possible to turn out 40,000 voters. But the Citizens Coalition
seems to be planning a full blitz, complete with radio advertising,
mass mailings, and bullhorn canvassing. Most of the costs will be
paid by Blount's campaign, which is largely self-financed.
</P>
<P>
   Financial disclosure reports filed on Thursday show that Blount
has outspent James by $5.4 million to $2.5 million during the
campaign. Some $3.7 million of Blount's money came from loans from
himself or his family members.
</P>
<P>
   James' campaign clearly takes the threat of crossover voting
seriously. ``If it were a traditional Republican primary, I think
James would win handily,'' said state Sen. Bill Armistead, a James
supporter. ``But when you add in the Democrats coming in to vote in
our primary, it's in question.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ralph Reed, James' campaign consultant, said Arrington might be
the key to the election. ``If he turns out 30,000, Blount might
win,'' Reed said.
</P>
<P>
   After unsuccessfully pursuing the mayor's support, James'
campaign now hopes that the endorsement of Blount will generate a
backlash that energizes its own supporters. Reed contends that
Blount must have cut a deal with the ``liberal Democratic boss''
involving promises of appointments and road financing, a charge
denied by both Blount and Arrington.
</P>
<P>
   Almost immediately after the endorsement was announced, some
300,000 fliers raising questions about such a deal were mailed
across the state. The fliers include a two-decade-old photograph of
Donald Watkins, a political aide to the mayor, who is shown with an
Afro haircut that has long been shorn.
</P>
<P>
   Blount said the fliers were ``trying to use race to inflame the
voters of Alabama.'' The author of the fliers, Joe Dickson, a black
Republican newspaper publisher and a James ally, said the
photograph of Watkins was the only one he could find in his files.
</P>
<P>
   Both Dickson and James said the governor had had no advance
knowledge of the fliers. Dickson says he did not pay all of the
$135,000 cost himself but has refused to say who paid the rest.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the campaign, James has pledged not to increase state
taxes. Blount, while refusing to take such a pledge, has said he
will eliminate the state's 4 percent sales tax on food within seven
years, for tax cuts totaling $260 million. He has not specified how
he would make up for the loss of revenue, other than through
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the sniping has had little to do with policy. James has
said that Blount is fat. A pair of James television advertisements
suggest that Blount, who owns automobile dealerships and a plastics
company, was a failure when he worked previously for his father's
manufacturing company. His father, Winton Blount, called the charge
a ``terrible damn lie.''
</P>
<P>
   In another ad, a female narrator taunts: ``Everybody knows that
Daddy had to loan you the money to run.''
</P>
<P>
   Blount has also been forced to address a 1969 car accident in
which he was driving a Jaguar at an estimated 90 miles an hour and
struck another car. His first wife was killed in the crash. A
police report said Blount, who was returning from a party, was
``obviously drunk.'' He was charged with misdemeanor manslaughter,
but the charge was later dropped.
</P>
<P>
   James has not raised the accident as an issue, but Blount blames
the governor's campaign for an anonymous smear sheet that was
mailed to reporters. ``I don't think the people of Alabama will see
it as an issue,'' Blount said. ``I made a mistake, and I pay for it
every day.''

 &HT;    Jays outslug Javy; Braves still blue
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- The AL East has the Braves gagged and strapped to a
chair. One team's interleague schedule is another's dental torture.
</P>
<P>
   Staked to a five-run lead off a pair of two-run homers, the
Toronto Blue Jays opened a weekend series with a 6-4 victory over
Atlanta that only continued the discomfort the Yankees wrought upon
this town.
</P>
<P>
   John Smoltz (5-2) struck out a season-high 10 but was done in by
two-run shots by Carlos Delgado in the first and Jose Canseco in
the sixth. Despite a two-homer game by Javy Lopez, the Braves fell
to their fifth loss in six games and their seventh in nine games,
the club's first serious tailspin since the season began. The
Braves have lost seven of their 11 games thus far to the AL East
and are now 12-11 this month.
</P>
<P>
   And say what you will about the bullpen, but in the last three
games Atlanta starters have given up 15 runs.
</P>
<P>
   Down by four in the seventh, the Braves tried and failed to
start a comeback with a Lopez solo homer _ his second in three
games _ and with two outs, Andruw Jones came within inches of
hitting another, the ball striking the yellow line atop the wall in
center for a long double. Pinch-hitter Ozzie Guillen followed up
with an infield single and Walt Weiss followed with a check-swing
single over third for his second RBI to bring the Braves to within
5-3.
</P>
<P>
   After 15 scoreless innings, the Braves finally broke through in
the sixth, following an Andruw Jones single, a Smoltz sacrifice and
Weiss' RBI single. Weiss, making his first start in six days
because of his son's illness, drove in his first run since June 7.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto picked up the night's second two-run homer in the sixth,
after Smoltz had already recorded eight strikeouts. Shawn Green
singled to left to bring up Canseco, who had been retired twice on
strikes by Smoltz. But on an 1-0 pitch, Canseco drove a low
breaking ball over the center field wall for his 23rd homer of the
season and a 4-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   But the Blue Jays weren't finished. Delgado followed Canseco
with a single and advanced to second on a Darrin Fletcher single.
With two outs, Ed Sprague next lifted a soft liner into shallow
right that Michael Tucker failed to handle in a diving attempt,
scoring Delgado for a 5-0 lead. In his first nine starts, Smoltz
had given up more than three runs only once.
</P>
<P>
   Jays starter Pat Hentgen faced the minimum through the first
three innings and when the Braves finally scratched out a hit _ a
Keith Lockhart infield single _ Jays shortstop Alex Gonzalez
worsened the situation by throwing into the Braves dugout, giving
Lockhart second base. But Hentgen responded by keeping the Braves
in the infield, retiring Tucker on a pop-up and Chipper Jones on a
ground-out to retire the side.

 &HT;    Chipper working way out of first slump
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Chipper Jones figures he goes through two stale
periods at the plate each season, and even while he ranked in the
top six in the National League in homers (18) and RBI (62) when
play began Friday night, he has determined he's in Period No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   With his left-handed average slipping to .304, Jones took early
batting practice, working on line drives and sending the ball back
up the middle, trying to work out of a 5-for-31 slump (.161) over
the last eight games. On June 2, Jones was batting .342 and has
dropped more than 30 points since.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm real disappointed in my hitting with runners in scoring
position,'' said Jones, who is hitting .279 with men on second or
third. ``There's no reason I shouldn't have 70, 75 RBI right now.
I'm hitting behind two guys (Walt Weiss and Keith Lockhart) who
have been on base all year and I'm hitting .270 with runners in
scoring position? That's ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones is still fighting a case of flu that zapped his strength,
but is also recovering from medication that kept him from sleeping.
On top of that, he endured four days of remarkable New York Yankees
pitching when he estimated he saw two pitches over the middle of
the plate _ an Orlando Hernandez fastball he hit for a two-run
single and a David Cone first-pitch fastball that Jones fouled off.
</P>
<P>
   Jones entered Friday night without a homer in 31 at-bats. Before
the slump, he averaged one long ball every 15.1 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   ``My left-handed swing is terrible,'' said Jones. ``A lot of
weak outs and wasted at-bats. I haven't felt real good for about
two weeks and being sick has something to do with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm starting to feel better now and I know I'm going to start
hitting again because my contact is getting better. I went through
about 10 days when I'd hit a ball right on the screws in batting
practice and couldn't get it out of the park.''

 &HT;    On deck: Toronto blue jays

 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When: 7:10 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Where: Turner Field.
</P>
<P>
   TV, radio: TBS, 750-AM.
</P>
<P>
   Probable starting pitchers: RHP Greg Maddux (10-2, 1.75; 1-0,
4.50 lifetime vs. Blue Jays) vs. RHP Juan Guzman (4-9, 5.44; first
appearance vs. Braves).
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Maddux, whose last defeat came nearly nine weeks ago, can
become the NL's first 11-game winner tonight. He is almost
completely over the stiff neck that forced him out of his last
start Monday at Yankee Stadium after just six innings. Maddux gave
up nine hits that night, more than in any of his previous 10
starts, and the three runs the Yankees scored were more than Maddux
had yielded in his previous 25 innings. Riding an eight-game win
streak, Maddux is approaching his career-best 10-game run, which he
has achieved twice, the last time June 17-Aug. 22 last season.
Guzman, coming off winter shoulder surgery for a torn labrum, has
been roughed up more than any Toronto starter. He has yielded 99
hits in 102.2 innings and already has issued an amazing 50 walks.
Maddux has walked just 16. But his 86 strikeouts are a credit to
successful surgery.

 &HT;    Wohlers looks for the answer
 &HT;    By Guy Curtright
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO _ More than 20 minutes into his daily workout, Mark
Wohlers has yet to pick up a baseball. But already his gray Braves
T-shirt is soaked nearly black.
</P>
<P>
   As the midday Florida sun beats down relentlessly, the
right-hander repeats and repeats the pantomime that he and the
Braves hope will start him on the road back to his rightful place
as Atlanta's All-Star closer.
</P>
<P>
   Wohlers should be at Turner Field, coming out of the bullpen in
the ninth inning to record a save for one of Atlanta's celebrated
starters _ and earn the $4.1 million he's making in the second year
of a three-year contract. Instead, he's at the lowest rung of the
team's minor-league system, learning how to pitch all over again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so messed up, I had to start from the beginning,''
Wohlers said. ``It's almost like learning how to pitch all over
again.''
</P>
<P>
   So, over and over, he throws an imaginary ball to an invisible
batter, making sure the delivery of his make-believe pitch is
perfect every time.
</P>
<P>
   Wohlers says he is making progress. But a week into his
self-imposed Florida exile, he still had not thrown a pitch to a
hitter, not even in batting practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think my mechanics are back to where they should be, maybe
even better than they've been in over a year,'' Wohlers said. ``But
I still need work on the mental part. That's where I'm still
struggling.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark has worked hard and picked up the changes we wanted to
make in his mechanics very quickly,'' said Braves special assistant
Guy Hansen, who was dispatched to Florida to work with Wohlers.
``But when he picks up a ball, he's still thinking too much and not
just throwing naturally. When you were as messed up as Mark was,
you can't turn things around in just a couple of days.''
</P>
<P>
   Wohlers proves that as he heads to a warmup mound for a throwing
session. At first, nearly every other pitch bounces in front of the
plate. Then, as he tries to compensate, Wohlers releases one pitch
too quickly and it sails over the 8-foot fence behind the catcher
and rolls nearly to the grandstand of a field where a Gulf Coast
Rookie League game is in progress.
</P>
<P>
   As the catcher runs to retrieve the wayward pitch, some of the
young Braves prospects look on in wonderment. Can this really be
the Mark Wohlers they had read about and watched on TV?
</P>
<P>
   Other big-league pitching stars have lost their ability to throw
the ball over the plate. In the early 1970s, Pittsburgh's Steve
Blass went from World Series hero to washout and never recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Wohlers, 28, knows nothing of Blass' struggles a quarter century
ago. But like Blass, he knows the cause is mental, not physical.
The arm remains strong. The psyche is weak.
</P>
<P>
   ``My problems are all up here,'' says Wohlers, pointing to his
head.
</P>
<P>
   Walter Herbison, a sports-performance consultant, worked with
the mental side of Wohlers' pitching development in the minors.
Wohlers called Herbison in Mississippi this week and asked him for
help again. Herbison caught the first plane for the Braves' complex
at Disney World.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark is very, very hard on himself,'' said Herbison, who
mainly works with college athletes. ``I just have him visualize
being successful and then let his natural ability take over. It's
important for an athlete to use the right side of his brain and not
let the left side confuse things. You can't be thinking too much
every time you throw a baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   As the bullpen continues to struggle, the pressure grows for
Wohlers to return to the majors as quickly as possible. He watches
the games on televisionand admits it isn't easy to be 400 miles
away.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very frustrating,'' said Wohlers, whose control problems
began in spring training. ``I feel I've let myself and my teammates
down. I want to be up there helping to win games again.''
</P>
<P>
   Wohlers hopes to pitch at Class AA Greenville or AAA Richmond as
early as next week. He has faced only one batter in nearly three
weeks, and the four-pitch walk June 12 against Montreal signaled
that something was very wrong with the pitcher who has saved 97
games the last three seasons.

   ``I don't have a timetable (for getting back to Atlanta),''
Wohlers said. ``I need to get my head back together, and then I
need to pitch nearly every day again. I've only pitched 16 innings
all season. When I started to feel I was getting it back together,
I got hurt (a slight tear of his left oblique muscle in early May).
Since then, it has been all downhill.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wish it was spring training instead of June,'' said
Hansen, a former pitching coach with Kansas City who once helped
get Bret Saberhagen and Tom Gordon back on track. ``Mark will get
it back together. But it will take a little time. And that's
something you don't have a lot of at this time of the season.''
</P>
<P>
   Lonely, Wohlers had his wife and 2-year-old daughter join him
for a few days. He hopes to be back with them in their new
Alpharetta home shortly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't given up,'' Wohlers said. ``Not at all. I'm getting
it back. I hope no one has given up on me.

 &HT;    Carson selects Palmolive executive to be next CEO
 &HT;    By Shelia M. Poole
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Carson Inc. said Friday it has tapped Gregory J.
Andrews, a 20-year personal care products industry veteran, to be
its new CEO.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement comes a day after Standard &AMP; Poor's revised its
outlook on the Savannah-based ethnic products maker to negative
from stable, amid concerns about the company's soft earnings from
its core businesses of hair relaxers, hair colorings and men's
shaving products.
</P>
<P>
   Andrews, 46, vice president and general manager of a
Colgate-Palmolive subsidiary in Buenos Aires, Argentina, will
assume the new position within the next month. He succeeds Roy
Keith, who relinquished the title earlier this month but remains
chairman.
</P>
<P>
   ``This looks like a positive (move) for the company,'' said Lucy
Patricola, an analyst with S&AMP;P in New York. ``Colgate-Palmolive is
an outstanding consumer products company, so no doubt they will
have a well-trained executive to lead Carson.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrews will help ``develop Carson's brands and brand loyalty
and identity,'' said Carson CFO Robert Pierce.
</P>
<P>
   Andrews joins Carson after nine years with Colgate-Palmolive. He
also held positions with Clairol Inc., The Gillette Co., Corning
Inc., and Johnson Products Co., which Carson recently announced it
planned to buy for $70 million cash.
</P>
<P>
   Industry watchers say Andrews will help refocus the ethnic
marketing and business strategies at Carson, which makes Dark &AMP;
Lovely, Excelle, Beautiful Beginnings and Magic. Carson has
announced it plans to sell its Cutex nail products business, which
represented a big departure from its core market.
</P>
<P>
   In recent quarters, the company has suffered from flat domestic
growth, due in part to distribution problems with retailers. Also,
margins have been adversely affected because of product mix,
production inefficiencies and higher infrastructure costs incurred
to support the company's growth, said S&AMP;P.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the ethnic hair care and beauty products industry is
seeing slower growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of the companies that manufacture and market (ethnic
products) is creating excitement and news at the consumer level,''
Pierce said. ``There's nothing to encourage consumers to think
about buying these products.''
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    Federated launches interactive division
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Federated Department Stores announced the creation of a new
interactive division, Macys.Com.
</P>
<P>
   The company said it hoped to leverage Macy's status as a leading
retailer to profit from the world of Internet commerce. Plans call
for Macys.Com to be a separate subsidiary of Federated.
</P>
<P>
   Federated maintains rather than eating away at its department
store trade, Macys.Com is designed to attract customers who don't
like department stores.
</P>
<P>
   The only other Federated store with an online outpost is
Bloomingdales (http:/www.
</P>
<P>
   bloomingdales.com). However, Macys.com president Kent Anderson
said there were no plans to include Bloomingdales.com in the
Macys.com project. Anderson also said plans call for Federated to
develop independent sites for its regional brands including Rich's
and Burdines once the Macy's site is successful.
</P>
<P>
   The current incarnation of Macys.Com offers a limited selection
of high-priced clothing, cosmetics and accessories clearly aimed at
upscale, computer-savvy shoppers. Macys.Com clearly understands the
possibilities of electronic commerce and knows what products will
appeal to its online customers (Anne Klein clothing, Clinique
cosmetics).
</P>
<P>
   They still face stiff competition from such experienced
``boutique'' shopping sites as clothiers L.L.Bean and J. Peterman;
booksellers such as Amazon.com; and computer makers such as Gateway
and Dell. Each of those online retailers has a solid knowledge of
direct marketing both on and off the Web. Macy's and Federated
don't have that.
</P>
<P>
   It's also unclear if cyber-shoppers, who like online shopping
experiences to be quick and easy, will want to browse through the
large selection and variety of offerings Macys.Com has planned.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson said a new version of Macy's online will launch in
October, with more than 2,500 items available for sale.
</P>
<P>
   Customers will be able to return or exchange merchandise at any
Macy's department store nationwide. Macys.Com also plans to
eventually offer a bilingualversion of the site.

 &HT;    Scientific-Atlanta cutting 125 jobs
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Scientific-Atlanta on Friday announced a
restructuring that will cut costs, shift some manufacturing to
Mexico and eliminate 125 jobs in its Atlanta operations.
</P>
<P>
   The moves are part of an effort to sharpen the Atlanta-based
company's competitive standing among telecommunications
manufacturers. They will result in estimated one-time charges of
$60 million to $75 million for the fourth fiscal quarter, which
ended Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But the company will also book a $100 million one-time gain as
part of revaluing its 1.5 million share stake in Broadcom, a maker
of various computer chips.
</P>
<P>
   None of these various moves will adversely affect the company's
financial results for the fourth quarter, executives said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The measures we are announcing today are necessary to improve
our competitive position,'' said James F. McDonald, the company's
president and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   In its biggest move, Scientific-Atlanta will transfer its radio
frequency amplifier line to Juarez, Mexico, from Atlanta. The
company said the high-volume, low-skill work required can be done
more cost-effectively in Juarez. Scientific-Atlanta has had a plant
there since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Scientific-Atlanta will consolidate manufacturing
that requires skilled engineers in Atlanta, closing operations in
Vancouver, British Columbia, and Melbourne, Fla. The company
estimates about 150 positions will be moved to Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The moves will result in a net loss of 125 jobs in Atlanta, the
company said.
</P>
<P>
   In the past five years, the company has created 1,500 jobs at
its Atlanta-based manufacturing and headquarters operations in
Norcross. The company is also completing the construction of a $40
million facility on 280 acres in Duluth.
</P>
<P>
   The first building is expected to open early next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Atlanta area remains the site of our worldwide
headquarters and a major manufacturing location,'' said McDonald.
``Our new facility in Gwinnett County will be the centerpiece of
our company's operations going forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, Scientific-Atlanta will move its European
headquarters to Frankfurt, Germany, from London to ``better address
market opportunities.'' Its Asian regional headquarters will be
moved to Singapore from Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   The company said it would combine its satellite networks and
tracking business units.

TAINTED TEXAS OYSTERS SICKEN 51 

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   GALVESTON, Texas _ Oyster wholesalers scrambled Friday to recall
shipments from throughout Texas and five other states as health
officials warned that an outbreak of illness from contaminated
Galveston Bay oysters could become the worst in U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
   Texas health officials had recorded 51 cases of the illness as
of Friday, with six involving people who had eaten Galveston Bay
oysters in Florida restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Coastal Leaseholders Association who harvest from
state-controlled Galveston Bay oyster beds were working with state
and federal officials to track shipments taken from seven beds
known to have produced oysters that made people sick.
</P>
<P>
   Oysters from the bay also have been shipped to restaurants in
California, Colorado, New Mexico and Louisiana, said Doug McBride,
spokesman for the Texas Department of Health.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd be surprised if there aren't a bunch more cases
reported,'' he said, adding that calls were coming in to a health
department toll-free number.
</P>
<P>
   The illness is caused by a bacterium called Vibrio
parahaemolyticus, which normally causes diarrhea and abdominal
cramps, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, this is the second-largest outbreak of Vibrio
parahaemolyticus in the country, and it has the potential of
surpassing the one a year ago in the Pacific Northwest, where they
had 208 cases and one fatality,'' said Dr. Ralph Morris, director
of the Galveston County Health District.
</P>
<P>
   For most people the organism is not life-threatening, Morris
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``By and large, this is a fairly mild disease, with diarrhea and
abdominal cramping,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   State health officials said some victims also could suffer
nausea, vomiting, fever and headache. They said symptoms can occur
from three to 30 hours after people eat contaminated oysters and
could last from one day to a week.
</P>
<P>
   Although death is rare, the disease can be particularly
dangerous to people who have liver problems or weakened immune
systems, state officials said.
</P>
<P>
   After agreeing late Thursday to quit harvesting oysters for at
least two weeks, Galveston Bay wholesalers were working Friday to
recall shipments of potentially harmful oysters from around Texas
and the other five states, McBride said.
</P>
<P>
   Morris said 17 cases of the illness have been reported since
June 5 in Galveston County. Those involved people who had eaten raw
oysters at Landry's Seafood Restaurant and Joe's Crab Shack in
Kemah and Willie G's restaurant in Galveston, he said.
</P>
<P>
   All three restaurants are owned by Houston-based Landry's
Seafood Restaurants Inc. The company announced Thursday it will
serve only oysters from Louisiana until Galveston Bay oysters are
declared safe.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Kemah and Galveston, people are known to have
gotten sick in Texas after eating oysters in restaurants in
Amarillo, Arlington, Austin, Athens, Abilene and Frisco, McBride
said.
</P>
<P>
   Morris said oystermen voluntarily ceased harvesting in the bay
and began recalling some shipments during a meeting with health
officials Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a real hard decision for them to come to, but I think
they're obviously acting in the interests of the public,'' Morris
said.
</P>
<P>
   Oystermen said while they could have kept harvesting in some
areas, they decided to quit taking oysters until the state tests
water and oysters from all of the beds.
</P>
<P>
   Marine scientist Dr. John Schwarz of Texas A&AMP;M
University-Galveston will conduct those tests and expects to have
results in 10 days, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa and Johnny Halili own Johnny's Oysters in San Leon and
employ about 150 workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We voluntarily surrendered our permits and closed ourselves
because we care about the public's health,'' said Lisa Halili, who
with her husband leases about 500 acres of oyster beds in the bay.
</P>
<P>
   The Halilis and five other wholesalers lease about 2,500 acres
of Galveston Bay oyster beds from the state. From May 1 to Nov. 1
each year, the leases are the only bay areas from which oysters can
be harvested, according to state regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Oysters taken from the leased beds are transplanted from
polluted waters and allowed to purge themselves of impurities for
several weeks before being harvested.
</P>
<P>
   Morris said the outbreak of the illness probably is related to
this year's unusual weather. The prolonged, early heat wave and
lack of rain changed the normal temperature and quality of the bay
water around the oyster beds, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This organism multiplies more readily in water that has high
salinity,'' Morris said.
</P>
<P>
   The outbreak will be costly and hard on fishermen's families,
Lisa Halili said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have 70 or 80 fishermen and they all have kids,'' she said.
``We'll see if some can go to Louisiana, but it's expensive to get
an out-of-state license.''
</P>
<P>
   Processing plant workers will not get paid if there are no
oysters, she added.
</P>
<P>
   State health officials urged people not to eat oysters from
Galveston Bay unless they are cooked thoroughly. There is little
risk from eating other seafood from the bay, they said, as long as
it is cooked.
</P>
<P>
   People who experience symptoms of the illness for more than 24
hours are advised to see a doctor. Anyone who has eaten seafood one
or two days before experiencing the symptoms is asked to call the
state Health Department at 1-888-883-9997.

 &HT;    Bush spares Lucas' life
 &HT;    By Mike Ward
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ Gov. George W. Bush, in an unprecedented and
politically risky decision, on Friday spared the life of Henry Lee
Lucas, once considered the nation's most prolific serial killer
after he confessed to murdering more than 600 people.
</P>
<P>
   Pronouncing Lucas ``unquestionably guilty of other despicable
crimes for which he has been sentenced to spend the rest of his
life in prison,'' Bush commuted Lucas' death sentence to a life
term in the Halloween 1979 slaying of a still-unidentified woman
known only as ``Orange Socks'' near Georgetown.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas, 61, had been scheduled for execution Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe there is enough doubt about this particular crime
that the State of Texas should not impose its ultimate penalty by
executing him,'' Bush said in announcing his decision in
Brownsville, where he was attending a conference of U.S.-Mexico
border governors.
</P>
<P>
   His decision was likely the first time since the 1930s that a
Texas governor commuted a death sentence based on a convicts'
claims of innocence without a court intervening first.
</P>
<P>
   From his death row cell at a prison outside Huntsville, Lucas
thanked Bush and the parole board ``for believing the truth and for
having the guts to stand up for what's right.'' Prison officials
said Lucas will move to another prison by Monday.
</P>
<P>
   As with the other 600-plus murders Lucas confessed to and then
recanted, he has for years maintained he was innocent of strangling
``Orange Socks,'' the only thing the woman was wearing when her
body was found near a culvert along I-35 north of Georgetown.
</P>
<P>
   No witnesses or physical evidence linked Lucas to the crime,
only his four confessions. But the jury that convicted Lucas in
1984 rejected as unbelievable his alibi that he was working as a
roofer in Jacksonville, Fla., the day the slaying occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's decision came a day after the state Board of Pardons and
Paroles, by a 17-1 vote, had recommended Lucas' sentence be reduced
to an unspecified lesser penalty. Bush rejected their
recommendation to delay Lucas' execution 270 days, a move rendered
moot by Friday's commutation.
</P>
<P>
   In a state where the death penalty always has enjoyed support
from about 70 percent of Texans, where the record number of
executions is a bragging right, Bush may not have made political
points by siding with Lucas. But no immediate political damage was
evident Friday, as one of the state's most vocal anti-crime groups,
the Houston-based Justice for All, supported the decision. Like
Bush, the group has been a staunch supporter of executions.
</P>
<P>
   Bush worded his two-page clemency proclamation to ensure that
Lucas will die in prison. Otherwise, prison officials confirmed,
Lucas could have been eligible for parole in as few as five years _
even though his chances of freedom were virtually non-existent
because of his notoriety.
</P>
<P>
   Though Lucas has five other life sentences, plus two 75-year
terms and a 60-year sentence, for other Texas murders, officials
said those terms are being served at the same time. And after about
20 years, he becomes automatically eligible for parole
consideration.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas has been behind bars since 1983.
</P>
<P>
   Bush erased Lucas' parole review by mandating that Lucas' new
life sentence begin only after he completes his other five life
terms.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the Texas charges, Lucas also faces a life term
without the possibility of parole in West Virginia for killing a
policeman Clemmie Curtis in 1976. And Florida authorities want to
question him in at least three killings in the Sunshine State.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Orange Socks'' case was Lucas' only death sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Reacting to Bush's decision, Jim Mattox, the former attorney
general who discredited many of Lucas' confessions during a 1985
investigation and had recently called for him to be spared, said
Bush's decision will ``make out death penalty stronger than ever.
But it was still politically risky, and I'll be glad to stand up
and defend him against any attack.''
</P>
<P>
   John Cornyn, Mattox's GOP opponent in the November election,
said he thinks Lucas should be have been executed. ``I have
confidence in both the jury who heard this case and the more than
23 judges who reviewed the evidence. I believe their decisions
should be respected,'' Cornyn said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, a leading advocacy group for crime victims'
rights, Justice for All, hailed Bush's move as the right decision.
``The State of Texas should not execute anyone whose guilt they
doubt _ and that was the case here,'' said president Dianne
Clements.
</P>
<P>
   Before the parole board's decision on Thursday, Bush's office
had received about 100 letters favoring clemency and six urging
execution. On Friday, though, the office received 178 phone calls
favoring Lucas' execution and only 18 favoring clemency.
</P>
<P>
   Within hours after Bush announced his decision, the family of
one of Lucas' victims _ in a 1978 murder to which Lucas confessed _
decried the outcome and said they were sorry they had remained
silent for so many years.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a joke going around that if you kill two people with a
pickax and never do another bad thing, you get executed,'' said
Georgetown resident Ninfa Salazar Sheppard, sister of Rita Salazar.
``If you confess to being a serial killer, you are psychological
curiosity worthy of keeping alive. If you exaggerate and claim to
have killed half the state, you become a poor, bumbling innocent:
you therefore cannot have been guilty of anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``Give me a break!''

DISNEY HOME VIDEO AIMS TO TEACH CHILDREN ABOUT CASH
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Walt Disney Co. is making a foray into the
world of financial advising with next month's release of ``Money
Rock,'' a collection of finance-themed songs that will teach kids _
and probably a lot of parents, too _ about money.
</P>
<P>
   The home-video primer has seven songs covering banks, weekly
allowances, checking accounts and Wall Street. The federal budget
is covered by Tax Man Max and Tyrannosaurus Debt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Money Rock'' is one of five ``Schoolhouse Rock'' videos that
Disney will release to retailers beginning July 21 at a suggested
price of $14.99 each.
</P>
<P>
   The animated cartoons on ``Money Rock'' run about four minutes
each and offer a lighthearted view of the often-cold world of
money.
</P>
<P>
   ``We make a decent living, it's true, but we gotta pay these
bills when they come due,'' a father tells his son in ``Where the
Money Goes.'' ``Now when a man had to settle, he pulled out coins
of precious metal'' is part of the history of barter in ``This for
That.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Money Rock'' uses the same style as ABC's Saturday morning
series ``Schoolhouse Rock.'' The video collection includes
``Grammar Rock,'' ``America Rock,'' ``Multiplication Rock'' and
``Science Rock.''

 &HT;    On-again, off-again confessor found notoriety behind bars
 &HT;    By Mike Kelley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ Henry Lee Lucas came to the world's attention on June
21, 1983, while being arraigned in Montague County on an indictment
of murdering an 82-year-old woman. The judge asked if he understood
the seriousness of the murder charge. ``Yes sir,'' he replied, ``I
have about a hundred of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the next couple of years, he confessed to hundreds of
murders across the country, then denied it all. Then he would
confess again, and then again he would deny it. One of many
prosecutors who crossed his path wrote that Lucas was ``the
greatest mass murderer in American history, the greatest liar in
American history, or both.''
</P>
<P>
   This week, he once more was in the spotlight he so came to love
when he first forced its warmth on himself 15 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, the State Board of Pardons and Paroles urged Gov.
George W. Bush to spare Lucas, who was scheduled to die Tuesday in
the death chamber at Huntsville. Friday afternoon, the governor
did, commuting Lucas' sentence to life in prison. In something of a
conundrum, the parole board chairman said, ``We firmly believe that
this man remains guilty as found by that jury.'' But, by a vote of
17-1, the board did not believe firmly enough to carry out th e
jury's sentence of death.
</P>
<P>
   That jury, in 1983, found Lucas had murdered a young woman,
never identified, whose body was found in a culvert next to
Interstate 35 north of Georgetown on Halloween 1979. Because of the
only clothing she wore, she has been known ever after as Orange
Socks.
</P>
<P>
   There was no physical evidence to connect Lucas to the crime.
But he confessed and, on the strength of that, was convicted. Of
his 11 convictions for murder, it was the only one that brought a
death sentence. Now, he denies that he did it. Indeed, the attorney
general of Texas says he considers it highly unlikely that Lucas
did the crime, and the man who was attorney general when Lucas was
convicted says there is no way he's guilty. But the Texas Ranger
who investigated another murder of which Lucas was convicted says,
``If anybody deserves to die for something he didn't do, I've never
met a better candidate than Henry.''
</P>
<P>
   A petty, grubby life
</P>
<P>
   Henry Lee Lucas' childhood was squalid and debased, mean and
devoid of anything that childhood is supposed to be. His adult
existence was at best a petty, grubby, physically filthy one,
wafting him around the country on the strength of an ill wind that
blew no good, a life that neither held nor brought any joy. If he
is to be believed, it was a life so perverted and degraded as to
slip beneath what can be considered human. His trademark, if he is
to be believed, was to slaughter his victims and have sex with
their corpses.
</P>
<P>
   He was born into the Great Depression, in 1936, in dirt-poor,
dirt-floor, rural Virginia. His mother was a 50-cent prostitute
described by someone who knew her as ``mean as a rattlesnake,''
according to author Mike Cox in his book ``The Confessions of Henry
Lee Lucas.'' Viola Lucas abused her son constantly and violently.
Once, she hit Henry in the head with a board, knocking him
unconscious for three days. He suffered from dizzy spells and
blackouts from then on.
</P>
<P>
   A childhood injury to his left eye resulted in the glass
prosthesis and droop-lidded look he bore for the rest of his life.
</P>
<P>
   He was in and out of jails and prisons all his life, beginning
at age 15 for a burglary.
</P>
<P>
   In 1960, the 23-year-old Henry was living with a half-sister in
a small town in Michigan when his mother came to visit. After
drinking, he stabbed and killed her. He served 10 years, five of
those in a psychiatric unit. Then he did five more years for
attempting to kidnap two teen-age girls.
</P>
<P>
   Drifting south to Jacksonville, Fla., he ran into an old
acquaintance named Ottis Toole, a dim-witted pyromaniac and
sometimes transvestite who also had been in and out of trouble with
the law since his early teens.
</P>
<P>
   It was that chance meeting that led to the hellish tangle of
crimes, real or imagined, that would begin to unravel with Lucas'
``I done about a hundred of them'' in the Montague County
courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas and Toole, in one junker car after another, traveled the
nation's interstate highways, usually with no particular
destination. According to what they said later, they killed as they
went, for money, sex or simply blood lust. At one point, they
claimed to have killed people in 48 states. Toole died in a Florida
prison in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes traveling with Lucas and Toole, sometimes with Lucas
alone, was Toole's niece Becky Powell, with whom Lucas had fallen
in love when she was 12 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Powell was 15 in 1982, and living with Lucas while he worked as
a handyman for 82-year-old Kate Rich in Montague County, on the Red
River northwest of Fort Worth. She wanted to go home to Florida,
and she and Henry made it as far as Denton County, where they were
spending the night in a field when they got into an argument. Lucas
later led lawmen to that field, where he had stabbed her to death,
dismembered her body and scattered it.
</P>
<P>
   The bombshell
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks later, back in Montague County, he offered Kate Rich
a ride to church, stabbed her to death and stuffed her body in a
drain pipe. Held on a weapons charge, Lucas confessed to murdering
both Powell and Rich. It was an arraignment for Rich's murder that
brought him to the courtroom where he dropped his bombshell.
</P>
<P>
   He then began confessing to Texas Ranger Phil Ryan, who had
investigated Rich's murder, details of other killings, 126 of them,
some complete with drawings of his victims.
</P>
<P>
   By late 1983, convicted in the deaths of Rich and Powell, Lucas
was in the Williamson County jail in Georgetown, awaiting trial for
the murder of Orange Socks, for which he made four separate
confessions.
</P>
<P>
   Besieged by requests from law enforcement officers around the
nation who were eager to interview Lucas about unsolved murders,
Williamson County Sheriff Jim Boutwell asked the Texas Department
of Public Safety for help. DPS established a task force to serve as
a clearinghouse for information.
</P>
<P>
   Within a couple of months, Lucas had talked to more than 100 law
officers who had ``cleared'' 23 crimes they believed were committed
by Lucas and another 36 by Lucas and Toole together. And his
schedule was full for weeks ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Lee was important for the first time in his life. He was
receiving constant attention. A copious drinker of coffee and
chain-smoker of Pall Malls, he had all he wanted of both. He had
been flown to other states to assist in unsolved cases. On the
road, if he wanted steaks, he got steaks. He was, one of his
court-appointed lawyers said, ``bouncy.'' Aside from being in
custody, it was probably the best he had ever lived. To keep that,
all he had to do was keep confessing.
</P>
<P>
   He seemed to enjoy telling people what he thought they wanted to
hear. Law officers who came to Georgetown were cautioned not to
give him too many details of their cases, not to give him enough to
let him make a believable confession. Several times, he had been
tested with fake information about fictitious cases and had taken
the bait.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, though, the man who seemingly would confess to
anything at first denied the murder for which he was sentenced to
death.
</P>
<P>
   Unidentified woman
</P>
<P>
   Ranger Phil Ryan had asked Lucas about an unidentified white
woman in her mid-20s, 5 feet, 9 inches and 138 pounds, who had been
strangled, her nude body dumped on the highway in Williamson County
in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did not take that one,'' Ryan says. ``He said 'No.' Later,
I saw Boutwell on TV, . . . and then I hear (Lucas) confessed to
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ed Walsh, then the district attorney who prosecuted Lucas for
the Orange Socks murder, says that a key point to him was that when
Boutwell was driving Lucas to Georgetown from Montague County,
Lucas pointed out the culvert where the body was discovered.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan says he asked Lucas about that, because of his initial
denial, and Lucas told him, ``'I knew I was looking for a culvert,
and when (Boutwell) slowed down, I just took the next one.' That
was just Henry.''
</P>
<P>
   The Orange Socks trial began in March 1984 in San Angelo in Tom
Green County on a change of venue from Williamson County. The
prosecution offered written, audiotaped and videotaped confessions.
Lucas said he had picked up the woman hitchhiking in Oklahoma, had
sex with her at a roadside picnic area, strangled her and dumped
her body in a culvert on I-35.
</P>
<P>
   The defense said work records and a cashed check showed that
Lucas was in Florida when the murder occurred. Prosecutors said the
records might have been falsified and that Lucas had plenty of time
to get to Florida to cash the check.
</P>
<P>
   The jury took 40 minutes to find him guilty of capital murder.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen years later, David Lindemann, who was on that jury,
says, ``The trial just seemed so overwhelming that he did it. He
went into details about how he killed the girl. . . . He admitted
to everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Walsh, then the district attorney, says he also has no doubts.
To the suggestion that Sheriff Boutwell might have in some way
hinted to Lucas where the body was found, Walsh says, ``He was not
the type of man who would do that.'' And, Walsh says, ``If I really
thought that an innocent man was about to be executed, I should be
and would be the first one to say, 'Wait a minute, let's take
another look.' I just don't have any of those feelings.''
</P>
<P>
   After his conviction, Lucas remained in Georgetown more than a
year, as the task force continued and yet more officers came to
talk to him.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Wilson was then Boutwell's chief deputy. The question of why
Lucas would continue to confess to other crimes after a conviction
for capital murder, he answers with another question. ``Once you
have the death penalty on one, why not tell officers anything they
wanted to hear? They can only kill you once.''
</P>
<P>
   Clear cracks
</P>
<P>
   While the law officers who came from near and far to question
Lucas had been cautioned all along to be wary of what he said, now
clear cracks began to appear in the mountain of confessions he was
piling up.
</P>
<P>
   In May of 1984, Henry Lee confessed to the 1975 murder in
Lubbock of Deborah Williamson. But when her parents read Lucas'
statement, they thought it was all wrong, that he did not do it.
</P>
<P>
   In April 1985, Dallas Times-Herald reporter Hugh Aynesworth, who
had interviewed Lucas, wrote a story that said Lucas had told him
that he'd killed his mother, Becky Powell and Kate Rich. All the
rest were hoaxes.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas denied it. He said that since talking to Aynesworth, his
newfound religious beliefs had compelled him to confess to all of
his murderous sins.
</P>
<P>
   Vic Feazell, the McLennan County district attorney, had convened
a grand jury in Waco to investigate three murders there to which
Lucas confessed. Feazell didn't believe him and asked for help from
the state attorney general's office. After meeting with Feazell and
with Lucas, Attorney General Jim Mattox said, ``I am convinced
Lucas is not guilty of some of the cases he has confessed to.''
From there, Mattox launched an investigation into Lucas' multitude
of confessions.
</P>
<P>
   That April 23 in Waco, Lucas set off another bomb. He said that
he had never killed anyone except his mother, 25 years earlier. He
put the blame for his confessions on Texas Rangers and other law
officers eager to clear unsolved cases. He said that God was the
reason he had ``decided to tell the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Six days later, Lucas was interviewed on audiotape by a radio
evangelist named Bob Larsen. Recanting his recantation, Lucas told
Larsen, ``I killed the people. . . . The truth is I killed 360
people, and the only way I can prove it is with the help of the
police in Georgetown and the Rangers.''
</P>
<P>
   Two days after that, Larsen aired the tape. But, he told his
listeners, moments before the show went on the air, Lucas had
called him from Waco and said to him, ``What I told you . . . was a
lie.''
</P>
<P>
   No further questioning
</P>
<P>
   A judge in Waco shortly thereafter barred media access to Lucas
and said law officers were not to question him without his lawyer
present. His lawyer said there would be no further questioning of
Lucas without permission, which effectively shut down the
long-running Henry Lee Lucas confession -denial show. Two years
after he blurted ``about a hundred of them,'' he was in Huntsville,
on death row.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, Attorney General Mattox released his office's Lucas
Report. While ``we found no evidence to prove that any members of
law enforcement in Texas deliberately tried to bring about this
scheme of deception,'' it said, ``we have found information that
would lead us to believe that some officials 'cleared cases' just
to get them off the books.''
</P>
<P>
   And, the report said there was a notable lack of physical
evidence linking Lucas to the crimes to which he confessed, except
for those of his mother, Becky Powell and the elderly widow, Kate
Rich.
</P>
<P>
   In the Orange Socks case, it concluded that Lucas was in Florida
at the time.
</P>
<P>
   But earlier this year, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
held that ``the Lucas Report does not contain any significant new
evidence that in substance was not presented to the jury.''
</P>
<P>
   The unsatisfying answer to whether Henry Lee Lucas was any kind
of serial killer or simply an adept and confident liar may best be
found in Jim Mattox's words when he first met Lucas in Waco 13
years ago. ``I'm not sure anybody really knows. I'm not sure even
he knows.''

SCHOLARS LOOK AT BASEBALL AND SEE THE AMERICAN ESSENCE

   COOPERSTOWN, N.Y. _ Beyond the chalk lines that arrow into lush
green outfields, beyond the packed dirt and the pristine white
bases, beyond the dugouts and the scoreboards that chart wins and
losses, and beyond the thousands of baseball players who have
lashed away at pitched balls, there is a grander Elysian field: it
is, simply, the idea and meaning of baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Every June for the last decade, a gaggle of academics
historians, anthropologists, linguists and sociologists gather at
this shrine to the game of summer to talk baseball, not as it is
played but what it means, how it shapes a culture, how it
conditions language, how it touches the soul. They come, these
scholars, in baseball hats clamped over bald pates or white hair,
and polo shirts stretched over bellies more intimate with beer than
situps, to ruminate on the game of which Walt Whitman wrote:
</P>
<P>
   ``Well it's our game; that's the chief fact in connection with
it: America's game; it has the snap, go, fling of the American
atmosphere; it belongs as much to our institutions, fits into them
as significantly as our Constitution's laws; is just as important
in the sum total of our historic life.''
</P>
<P>
   Philosophizing about baseball has not, of course, remained the
preserve of academia; indeed, from political pundits like George
Will to Canadian novelist W.P. Kinsella, the stadium of rumination
remains vast. But for scholars, particularly scholars who may once
have dreamed of walking onto the field of a major league ball park,
the game and its place in American life is rich in both symbolism
and meaning; it is for many, despite its many problems, an axis on
which the American experience turns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of what is written about baseball is very narrow,'' said
Peter Rutkoff, a professor of history at Kenyon College in the
small Ohio town of Gambier, ``or baseball nuts writing for baseball
nuts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We say right up front,'' chimed in Alvin Hall, now a dean and
historian at the Union Institute in Cincinnati and founder of the
yearly symposium, ``that we're not interested in baseball as
baseball, but baseball as part of American culture. Baseball is
regarded as a quintessential American sport. So to understand
American culture, you have to understand baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet because these scholars claim they come here not so much to
praise baseball, there was at first a grumble of skepticism from
the guardians of the Hall of Fame about a group of (nearly all) men
who didn't care so much about scores and earned run averages or who
was the best shortstop of the 1950s. Why should the Hall, where
greatness is arrayed on bronze plaques in a nave of marble and
bleached wood, admit philosophers and linguists and historians into
its embrace, it was said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' said Hall, ``I think we demonstrated to them the
educational function of a meeting like this. And the museum at the
Hall is the broader base of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, the symposium, which is sponsored by the Hall of Fame and
the State University of New York at Oneonta and whih draws between
70 and 120 scholars each year, is as much a part of Cooperstown's
summer rituals as the All-Star Game is to major league ball.
</P>
<P>
   Over three days in mid-June, the scholars, who hailed from both
coasts and much in between, surveyed the landscape of American
culture and the role of baseball, from issues of sexuality to
notions of leadership theory, from unionization to melancholy in
American life.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the outfield of ideas and reflection about baseball
seems to be without fences. Part of the Americanizing ritual
smoldering just below the surface of baseball, Thomas Altherr, a
historian at Metropolitan State College in Denver, told his
colleagues, is the pervasive sexuality that surrounds the game.
</P>
<P>
   From the reckless and relentless womanizing of many players to
condoms carrying the image of Ted Williams (the last batter to hit
over .400), even to ancient baseball-like fertility rituals.
</P>
<P>
   How ancient? ``In Mesopotamia, on the first of May, young women
underwent a puberty ritual in which they batted a rock across a
field and ran around it to ensure fertility,'' Altherr said, ``In
an additional rite, the women circled a path of four bases, each
corresponding symbolically to their own infancy, childhood,
adulthood and finally full womanhood.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet as Altherr pointed out, in the 19th century, baseball was
shrouded in a culture of prudishness, so much so that Ladies Days
were held so that women in the stands could provide a calming
effect on frenzied male fans. That, of course, has given way, he
said, to endless braggadocio of sexual prowess among ball players,
beginning most notably, and perhaps most appropriately, with Babe
Ruth, arguably the greatest batter of all time.
</P>
<P>
   Where this evolution of attitudes will lead, Altherr says, is
uncertain. ``Will baseball be more sexualized?'' he asked. ``How
long will it be before we have Dallas Cowboy cheerleaders? So far,
thank goodness, there's nothing like that glitzy sexuality.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanton Green, a bearded anthropologist from Pittsburgh's
Clarion University, argued that baseball, as an Americanizing
ritual, is a very important part of the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the chronicle of immigrants to this country,'' Green
suggested, ``baseball has been very much a mirror of the rise and
assimilation of ethnic groups, from early Irish to the most recent
arrivals, the Japanese. The transition from Jackie Robinson to Nomo
_'' a celebrated but now troubled Japanese pitcher ``_ is a fairly
interesting reminder of this country's immigration pattern. Now,
Latin American and Asian ball players are the new immigrants.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The consequence,'' he said, ``is that the next generation of
baseball will be more global than we're used to.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Green said there is a second, and ultimately more troubling
question, however, and that is whether the game will cease to
remain a lynchpin between generations, a vehicle by which the
elements of American culture are passed from grandfather to father
to son.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baseball has played a role in transforming children, at least
boys, into adults,'' he explained. ``Now, that's less true.
Baseball is not so much part of that initiation anymore.
Generations are cut off more. As Margaret Meade has pointed out,
the generation gap is really a culture gap, a gap in passing on
culture from one generation to the next.''
</P>
<P>
   In part, Green argued, this is because baseball has itself
changed and, as a result, what it means to children, mostly boys,
today is different from the meaning and role in children's lives in
previous generations.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, he suggested, it has become very difficult to
identify individual players with individual teams simply because
ball players move relatively easily from one team to the next. On
the other, the presentation of baseball has been transformed from
one where the game itself remained the centerpiece to a spectacle
of gifts, flashing scoreboards, dancing grounds keepers. ``Kids
want to go to the game for whatever trinket they're getting, not
for the baseball,'' he said, somewhat ruefully. ``Baseball was part
of my initiation. That's not so true anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   If this is so, he asked, it is an open question whether baseball
will continue to remain central to the Americanizing experience of
earlier immigrant generations.
</P>
<P>
   For some at the symposium, baseball touches the most profound
emotional level of existence. ``While the game displays a
significant physical beauty and radiates a spiritual
transcendence,'' said George Grella, a professor of English at the
University of Rochester, ``it also expresses the parallel
paradoxical quality of sadness.''
</P>
<P>
   Although such cultural observations veer dangerously toward the
mawkish (or worse, the pompous), a decided risk when people unleash
their rhetorical powers on the game of baseball, Grella and others
strove to cement their arguments with evidence.
</P>
<P>
   And for Grella, the stuff of sadness is voluminous, from the
solitary positioning of fielders to the wreckers' ball at Ebbets
Field. As Carl Yastrzemski, the great Boston Red Sox catcher who
was the last man to win the Triple Crown, said: ``I loved the game.
I loved the competition. But I never had any fun. I never enjoyed
it. All hard work, all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   In an essay he called ``The Melancholy of Baseball,'' Grella
suggested to his fellow scholars and baseball fans that the
ambiguity of the game echoes the voices of mainstream culture. ``If
baseball celebrates youth,'' he said, ``it also reminds us of
mortality; if a game can last forever, it is also an ephemeral
endeavor; it usually inspires lyric poetry, but also lends itself
to the elegiac mode. . . . it instructs us in two crucial American
concepts, the loneliness of space and the sadness of time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It creates an immense green field, a gorgeous vista invoking
the pastoral, the agricultural, even the peaceable kingdom, but it
hints that the lush green garden may also be a vale of tears.
Baseball is the saddest game.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so sad, though, that the scholars refrained from crowding
around Clete Boyer, a former Yankee great, who graced the occasion
with his presence. And not so melancholy that a game of Town Ball,
an early 19th-century precursor of the modern game, played by
competing squads of slow-moving academics, ended in a redemptive
tie, 21-21.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's two sides to this conference,'' laughed Kenyon's
Rutkoff, a gangly man whose eyes glitter at the sight of a bat and
ball. ``There's the academics. But there's also the little kid
worshipping their heroes.''

O'NEILL'S BAT SALVAGES TORRE'S EXPERIMENT

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Paul O'Neill walked across the Shea Stadium outfield
alone four hours before Friday night's game, wandering like a fan
trying not to get noticed. Joe Torre and a dozen of O'Neill's
teammates had already vanished into the third base dugout, and he
crept along so deliberately that it was easy to overlook him.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the monumental matchup between the Yankees and the
Mets was over Friday night, it was impossible not to notice O'Neill
and impossible to overlook what he had done. O'Neill might have
breezed across the grass like a nobody in the afternoon, but he
breezed around the bases like a somebody in the evening.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill saved the first-time first baseman Jorge Posada from a
dubious distinction and saved Torre, his manager, from criticism
for putting the catcher at first base in place of Tino Martinez. By
clubbing a three-run homer off Mel Rojas in the seventh inning to
erase a 4-3 deficit, O'Neill helped catapult the Yankees to an 8-4
victory before 53,404 fans.
</P>
<P>
   After O'Neill reached a rowdy dugout, a slice of the Bronx had
invaded Flushing.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have two teams that are both from New York, there's
no in between,'' O'Neill had said earlier. ``You can't like the
Yankees and the Mets. It's either one or the other. That's what
makes this so important to the fans.''
</P>
<P>
   It is also important to the man who signs O'Neill's checks, who
was surely unhappy when Posada almost turned the night into a
nightmare. Posada was blunt when asked what Mets Manager Bobby
Valentine might do against a catcher making his major league debut
at first.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hit it over there,'' Posada said. ``Find out if he can play.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets did precisely that, and that is why they almost
defeated the Yankees in the back-and-forth clash. Whenever a
manager tries to use an inexperienced player at a new position,
there is the danger that the player will be involved in a critical
sequence. Posada was in that position Friday night, and he
faltered.
</P>
<P>
   With the score at 3-3 in the sixth and Mets perched on first and
third with none out, the Yankees moved Posada and third baseman
Scott Brosius in for a potential play at the plate. So when Carlos
Baerga smacked a sharp one-bouncer to Posada, he should have
whipped the ball home to Joe Girardi to nab Mike Piazza from third.
</P>
<P>
   But Posada's adventure started once he took two steps to his
left and touched first base for the first out. Though it was a
risky choice, Posada still had time to gun Piazza down at home.
Instead, he flipped the ball to Derek Jeter at second base, and
Jeter eventually tagged John Olerud for a double play. The Yankees
got two outs, but the wrong two, and the Mets got one pivotal run
for a 4-3 lead. Posada got one huge demerit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to have the instincts,'' he had said. ``I've
never played first. I won't be like Tino. It's not going to come
natural to me.''
</P>
<P>
   It did not. Posada conceded he did not know how adequate a first
baseman he would be, but he proved adequate enough until the sixth.
Posada was more productive offensively as a one-night replacement
for the slumping Martinez as he ripped three hits, drove in one run
and scored another.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's playing first?,'' Martinez, who had lobbied Torre to
start him against the left-hander Al Leiter, said before the game.
Martinez, who bats left-handed and who has a sore right shoulder
after being hit by a pitch from Atlanta's John Rocker on Thursday
night, quickly changed his tone of surprise and said: ``He will do
fine. He's a good athlete.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, a good athlete does not automatically become a good first
baseman. Posada, who was drafted by the Yankees as a shortstop and
often fields grounders during batting practice, said he played
first base for Santurce in the Puerto Rican winter league. It was
the first time Posada had made such a revelation; he previously had
said he was used as a designated hitter in about 20 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stop lying to the reporters,'' Jeter shouted to Posada. ``You
never played first.''
</P>
<P>
   The amusing scene was still amusing to the Yankees after the
game because of O'Neill. Once O'Neill went deep off Rojas' first
pitch in the seventh, the Yankees exhaled. They had walked across
Shea in the afternoon, with O'Neill trailing them, and they bolted
from Shea in the night, with O'Neill leading them.
</P>
<P>
   ``For this weekend, these games mean something,'' O'Neill said.
``But later in the season, they won't mean anything. We lost once
to the Mets last year. I don't remember that. The only loss I
remember is losing at the end to Cleveland.'' &QL;

JUDGE REJECTS RESULTS OF AFFIRMATIVE ACTION VOTE IN HOUSTON 

</HEADLINE>

(See optional ending)

c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ A judge Friday threw out the results of last fall's
election in which voters upheld Houston's affirmative action
program.
</P>
<P>
   State District Judge Sharolyn Wood said the city's language on
the Nov. 4 ballot did not reflect the intent of the more than
20,000 people who had signed petitions to put the question to
voters. Opponents had argued that the city purposely changed the
language in order to defeat the referendum.
</P>
<P>
   The program sets an overall goal of 20 percent participation for
women and minorities for city contracts. The issue also put the
national spotlight on Houston for its bucking of a growing
dissatisfaction with set-aside programs.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, Proposition A, was soundly defeated by a 54 percent
to 46 percent margin. Former Mayor Bob Lanier, who led opposition
to the affirmative action referendum, was applauded by President
Clinton for his efforts in defeating the measure.
</P>
<P>
   In a prepared statement, Mayor Lee Brown, in San Antonio
attending the Texas Democratic Convention, said Friday that the
city will appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very disappointed that Judge Wood agreed that the
ballot language did not fairly convey the subject matter. Unless
the city appeals, the city will be obligated to hold a second
charter election at a cost of more than one million dollars to city
taxpayers,'' the mayor's statement said.
</P>
<P>
   William Helfand, attorney for petition organizer Ed Blum and two
others, said his clients want an election as soon as possible,
although he expects no such election will happen until after the
appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``People should be judged in contracts and hiring on the basis
of their ability and not on the basis of their race,'' said
plaintiff Edward Chen, 61, a chemistry professor who is
Chinese-American. ``Unless people stand up for what they believe,
our country will fall into the hands of City Hall.''
</P>
<P>
   Blum, 46, who spearheaded the ballot petition drive and who
originally filed the lawsuit contesting the election, has declined
to comment recently on the matter. The third plaintiff, high school
teacher Al Vera, also was unavailable for comment.
</P>
<P>
   During Tuesday's summary judgment arguments, Wood said the city
has some flexibility in changing the wording of a proposition
brought by voters as long as the original meaning is preserved. But
her ruling Friday indicates that language on the ballot that was
composed by the city was significantly different from that of the
petitions.
</P>
<P>
   The proposition originally submitted by Blum read: ``The city of
Houston shall not discriminate against, or grant preferential
treatment to, any individual or group on the basis of race, sex,
color, ethnicity or national origin in the operation of public
employment and public contracting.''
</P>
<P>
   At the urging of Lanier, City Council changed the wording to:
``Shall the charter of the city of Houston be amended to end the
use of affirmative action for women and minorities in the operation
of city of Houston employment and contracting, including ending the
current program and similar programs in the future?''
</P>
<P>
   Helfand told Wood on Tuesday that Lanier chose the language
because polls taken before the election showed the new phrasing
``would significantly change results.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The city clearly purposely injected emotionally charged
phrases like `affirmative action' and identified women and
minorities,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Helfand said because it is unclear if the term affirmative
action means ``equal opportunity or preferences,'' a California
court rejected the use of the phrase on Proposition 209, an
initiative in which voters ended that state's use of affirmative
action programs.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney also argued the city improperly substituted a
specific policy for a philosophy that could have had larger
implications.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Lanier said that his purpose in changing the wording
was so voters would know exactly what the impact of the proposition
would be.
</P>
<P>
   ``The petitioners tried to get it on the ballot without saying
they wanted to end affirmative action,'' Lanier said. ``To my mind
they are the ones who were trying to be deceptive.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Wood's ruling did not resolve all the issues in the case,
including one raised by the city because Blum no longer lives in
Houston and another because Chen and Vera joined the suit after the
summary judgment motions were filed.
</P>
<P>
   Wood ruled Blum could contest the election because he was
eligible to vote in November, but said he does not have standing to
ask for a new election because he now lives in West University
Place. Helfand said he is confident Wood still will order a new
election because Chen and Vera live in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Wood set a trial date of Aug. 17 to hear arguments on whether
she can order a new election.
</P>
<P>
   A pending case challenging the constitutionality of the
affirmative action program might make the issue of a new election
moot.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Court Judge Lynn N. Hughes is expected to rule
this summer on a lawsuit filed by grass and sod contractor Robert
Kossman, who says the city denied him contracts, even though he was
the low bidder, because he is white.
</P>
<P>
   In November, the same judge struck down the Metropolitan Transit
Authority's affirmative action program in language so broad that
the city's seemed to also be in danger. The case currently is
before the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the program interpreted the statement as an
indication Hughes is leaning toward dismantling the program, but
city leaders said Hughes was only advising them to make stronger
arguments showing a history of discrimination than those made by
Metro.
</P>
<P>
   The goals for minority participation in the program are 17
percent of construction contracts, 11 percent of purchasing and 24
percent of professional services.
</P>
<P>
   These goals were drafted by Lanier in 1995, modifying a 1984
affirmative action program.
</P>
<P>
   City Councilman Rob Todd, an outspoken opponent of affirmative
action, said the city should ``absolutely'' spend the money for a
new election.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let this be an example to all council members that just
because the city attorney says something is correct, that doesn't
mean that it is,'' said Todd, who applauded the ruling as a
vindication of those on council who opposed rewriting the ballot
measure.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, said she was ``extremely
disappointed'' at the ruling and hopes that the city appeals it to
the highest level.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public knew what it was voting for,'' said Jackson Lee,
who was also attending the Texas Democratic Convention.

 &HT;    TIANANMEN QUIETED FOR CLINTON, JIANG CEREMONY
 &HT;    With CHINA-CLINTON0627-2NDLD.
 &HT;    By MARCIA KUNSTEL and JOSEPH ALBRIGHT 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Tiananmen Square was quiet as a mausoleum early
Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
   The world's biggest public square was flat and broad and nearly
empty, a circle of red flags high on central poles waving under
gentle breezes.
</P>
<P>
   Not a kite-flier was there to float a brilliant-colored dragon
or bird through the sky. Absent were the crowds of Chinese who
daily come from the provinces to snap photos at their country's
famous memorials.
</P>
<P>
   It was a peoples' square that blocked out the people for half of
one hot morning.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, two soldiers walked two German shepherds up and down
the gray paving stones, sniffing for anything that might spoil the
soon-to-come moment of glory for China's leaders and even for many
of its common people.
</P>
<P>
   A short row of soldiers in green stood at attention for more
than an hour behind eight cannons lined up below the flags, near
the Monument to the People's Heroes at center square.
</P>
<P>
   The metro was closed. The streets were closed. The cars and
bicycles and pedestrians were held at bay by soldiers or police
standing like ramrods at every conceivable entry point to the vast
space.
</P>
<P>
   This was the square with the Chinese government in full control,
on this particular Saturday morning sending the message that this
is not a government to trifle with.
</P>
<P>
   That was the message because this was the ceremony for U.S.
President Bill Clinton, and he would soon become the first American
president to visit this place since the 1989 horrors unfolded when
tanks rolled through the streets and into the square and mowed down
hundreds of Chinese people. Some had been protesting and demanding
democracy. Others had just gotten in the way.
</P>
<P>
   Americans had protested Clinton's agreement to be welcomed here,
saying it was an endorsement of a Chinese government that never
admitted it had done wrong here nine years ago. But he chose to
come anyway. The Chinese had asked. How could he said no?
</P>
<P>
   The ceremony itself began sharply at 9 a.m. (China time) when
Clinton and his wife and Chinese President Jiang Zemin and his wife
appeared on the smaller plaza adjacent to Tiananmen fronting the
monstrously-big Great Hall of the people.
</P>
<P>
   It was sober and solemn once the four finished glad-handing the
dignitaries who came -- a couple dozen Chinese VIPs and hundreds of
Americans invited to drop their normal activities as students or
teachers or business executives and come watch their President.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Jiang stood on a red-carpeted podium with brass
rails and listened to the military band play their national
anthems, as the canon in the square boomed out the 21 shots in
salute.
</P>
<P>
   It was majestic, somber and sad.
</P>
<P>
   As the two presidents walked past in review of the troops,
Clinton was stiff and serious, almost looking pained, though he
never seemed to look over the heads of the soldiers and into the
square beyond that symbolizes the killing of a notion of freedom.

TAINTED TEXAS OYSTERS SICKEN 51 AS SHIPMENTS RECALLED

<P>
   GALVESTON, Texas _ Oyster wholesalers scrambled Friday to recall
shipments from throughout Texas and five other states as health
officials warned that an outbreak of illness from contaminated
Galveston Bay oysters could become the worst in U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
   Texas health officials had recorded 51 cases of the illness as
of Friday, with six involving people who had eaten Galveston Bay
oysters in Florida restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Coastal Leaseholders Association who harvest from
state-controlled Galveston Bay oyster beds were working with state
and federal officials to track shipments taken from seven beds
known to have produced oysters that made people sick.
</P>
<P>
   Oysters from the bay also have been shipped to restaurants in
California, Colorado, New Mexico and Louisiana, said Doug McBride,
spokesman for the Texas Department of Health.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd be surprised if there aren't a bunch more cases
reported,'' he said, adding that calls were coming in to a health
department toll-free number.
</P>
<P>
   The illness is caused by a bacterium called Vibrio
parahaemolyticus, which normally causes diarrhea and abdominal
cramps, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, this is the second-largest outbreak of Vibrio
parahaemolyticus in the country, and it has the potential of
surpassing the one a year ago in the Pacific Northwest, where they
had 208 cases and one fatality,'' said Dr. Ralph Morris, director
of the Galveston County Health District.
</P>
<P>
   For most people the organism is not life-threatening, Morris
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``By and large, this is a fairly mild disease, with diarrhea and
abdominal cramping,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   State health officials said some victims also could suffer
nausea, vomiting, fever and headache. They said symptoms can occur
from three to 30 hours after people eat contaminated oysters and
could last from one day to a week.
</P>
<P>
   Although death is rare, the disease can be particularly
dangerous to people who have liver problems or weakened immune
systems, state officials said.
</P>
<P>
   After agreeing late Thursday to quit harvesting oysters for at
least two weeks, Galveston Bay wholesalers were working Friday to
recall shipments of potentially harmful oysters from around Texas
and the other five states, McBride said.
</P>
<P>
   Morris said 17 cases of the illness have been reported since
June 5 in Galveston County. Those involved people who had eaten raw
oysters at Landry's Seafood Restaurant and Joe's Crab Shack in
Kemah and Willie G's restaurant in Galveston, he said.
</P>
<P>
   All three restaurants are owned by Houston-based Landry's
Seafood Restaurants Inc. The company announced Thursday it will
serve only oysters from Louisiana until Galveston Bay oysters are
declared safe.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Kemah and Galveston, people are known to have
gotten sick in Texas after eating oysters in restaurants in
Amarillo, Arlington, Austin, Athens, Abilene and Frisco, McBride
said.
</P>
<P>
   Morris said oystermen voluntarily ceased harvesting in the bay
and began recalling some shipments during a meeting with health
officials Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a real hard decision for them to come to, but I think
they're obviously acting in the interests of the public,'' Morris
said.
</P>
<P>
   Oystermen said while they could have kept harvesting in some
areas, they decided to quit taking oysters until the state tests
water and oysters from all of the beds.
</P>
<P>
   Marine scientist Dr. John Schwarz of Texas A&AMP;M
University-Galveston will conduct those tests and expects to have
results in 10 days, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa and Johnny Halili own Johnny's Oysters in San Leon and
employ about 150 workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We voluntarily surrendered our permits and closed ourselves
because we care about the public's health,'' said Lisa Halili, who
with her husband leases about 500 acres of oyster beds in the bay.
</P>
<P>
   The Halilis and five other wholesalers lease about 2,500 acres
of Galveston Bay oyster beds from the state. From May 1 to Nov. 1
each year, the leases are the only bay areas from which oysters can
be harvested, according to state regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Oysters taken from the leased beds are transplanted from
polluted waters and allowed to purge themselves of impurities for
several weeks before being harvested.
</P>
<P>
   Morris said the outbreak of the illness probably is related to
this year's unusual weather. The prolonged, early heat wave and
lack of rain changed the normal temperature and quality of the bay
water around the oyster beds, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This organism multiplies more readily in water that has high
salinity,'' Morris said.
</P>
<P>
   The outbreak will be costly and hard on fishermen's families,
Lisa Halili said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have 70 or 80 fishermen and they all have kids,'' she said.
``We'll see if some can go to Louisiana, but it's expensive to get
an out-of-state license.''
</P>
<P>
   Processing plant workers will not get paid if there are no
oysters, she added.
</P>
<P>
   State health officials urged people not to eat oysters from
Galveston Bay unless they are cooked thoroughly. There is little
risk from eating other seafood from the bay, they said, as long as
it is cooked.
</P>
<P>
   People who experience symptoms of the illness for more than 24
hours are advised to see a doctor. Anyone who has eaten seafood one
or two days before experiencing the symptoms is asked to call the
state Health Department at 1-888-883-9997.

YANKEES DRAW FIRST BLOOD FROM METS, 8-4 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: See also METS-YANKS-O'NEILL and METS-YANKS-PITCHING) 
(mk) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Rivers of blue hats formed in the aisles at Shea
Stadium after the eighth inning Friday night, Mets fans, depressed
and departing. Above them, a mocking chorus started: ``Hey, Hey,
Na, Na, Goodbye.'' Yankee fans were serenading their counterparts
out of their own park.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees had won the city's bragging rights for at least one
day, after Paul O'Neill ripped a three-run homer in the seventh
inning off Mel Rojas, propelling the Bronx team to an 8-4 victory
over the Queens team. A crowd of 53,404 was on hand, the largest of
the season at Shea, the enthusiasm hardly dampened by the
sweltering heat.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill's home run turned a 4-3 deficit into a 6-4 advantage,
and the Yankees added two late runs. Ramiro Mendoza pitched 2 2/3
scoreless innings to earn the victory in relief, and Mariano Rivera
picked up his 19th save by getting the final two outs.
</P>
<P>
   A defensive lapse by Jorge Posada, making his first major-league
appearance at first base, allowed the Mets to take a 4-3 lead in
the sixth. Mets fans, who constituted perhaps 60 percent of the
crowd, howled and shouted and chanted, nine outs from seizing the
first game of the series that continues Saturday afternoon and
Sunday night. But Al Leiter, the Mets' starting pitcher, had
labored through the middle innings, and eventually a contribution
would be needed from the Mets' slumping bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Leiter walked Chuck Knoblauch with one out in the seventh, and
Derek Jeter chopped a slow roller toward the first-base hole.
Leiter, a left-hander, flies off toward third base as he completes
his delivery, and knowing he would have to cover first, he twisted
awkwardly with his first step. Jeter beat out the play, and Leiter
was limping on a strained knee. He would have to come out.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Bobby Valentine called on the right-handed Rojas to
pitch to O'Neill, the Yankees' left-handed-hitting right fielder.
Valentine knew the numbers: While right-handed batters have hit
.397 against Rojas, lefties had batted only .182 against him, with
no home runs.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill stood in the on-deck circle and watched Rojas warming
up, then strolled to the plate. Rojas fired his first pitch
homeward, a fastball _ and O'Neill blasted it high and long into
the left-field stands.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill slapped his hands together as he rounded first base, his
teammates joyously spilling out of their dugout, high-fiving each
other. O'Neill paused at home plate before stamping on the base,
then high-fived Jeter and Knoblauch and plunged into a sea of
teammates.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets and Yankees pretend that they like the other
organization, and that this series is just like any other
regular-season series. But those polite gestures hardly explain why
some in the Yankee offices have lived in fear of consecutive losses
to the Mets and the reaction they could generate from a certain
principal owner, or why the Mets engaged in unsubtle gamesmanship.
</P>
<P>
   Yogi Berra, a Yankee legend who has vowed to avoid Yankee
Stadium because of his feud with George Steinbrenner, threw out the
first ball at Shea Friday night. The Mets changed uniforms for the
game, stripping their names off the back. And a day before the
series was to begin, Valentine hinted to reporters that Hideki
Irabu, the Yankees' starter, was tipping his pitches.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, both the Yankees and the Mets believe that Irabu is
providing clues that contributed to his beating in Cleveland last
Sunday (five runs and three home runs in three innings). But, as
the two sides prepared for Friday night's game, they had completely
different ideas on what clue Irabu is giving.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets, according to a member of the organization, believe
that Irabu's intentions can be read from his feet: When he's
throwing a fastball, his front foot bursts forward quickly; when
throwing an off-speed pitch, a curveball or a splitter, the Mets
say Irabu is much more deliberate with his front foot.
</P>
<P>
   Fast foot, fastball. Slow foot, curveball or splitter.
</P>
<P>
   Mel Stottlemyre, the Yankee pitching coach, disagreed. He
thought Irabu was tipping his pitches somehow with his glove.
</P>
<P>
   Irabu may or may not be tipping his pitches, and the Mets may or
may not have been reading him correctly. But this much is true:
They were all over everything he threw Friday night. Edgardo
Alfonzo, the Mets' first hitter, fouled off five pitches during his
10-pitch at-bat _ and the first time through the batting order, the
Mets had 14 foul balls and only one swing and miss, that by Leiter.
</P>
<P>
   Irabu's stuff was too good for the Mets to exploit, however, and
he was fortunate to survive a potentially disastrous first inning.
After Alfonzo walked and scampered to third on Bernard Gilkey's
hit-and-run single through the right side, Irabu walked Mike Piazza
on four pitches, filling the bases. A couple of hits might have
finished Irabu that quickly, but John Olerud bounced into a doube
play, Alfonzo scoring from third, and Carlos Baerga grounded out to
end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   With the reprieve, the Yankees began trading the lead with the
Mets. Posada tied the score at 1-1 with a run-scoring single in the
fourth, and Knoblauch drove home the lead run in the fifth, putting
the Yankees ahead by 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   But the Mets responded when Brian McRae timed an Irabu fastball
leading off the fifth _ fast foot, fastball _ and whacked it off
the right-field foul pole for a home run. Three batters later,
Alfonzo waited perfectly for a curveball _ slow foot, curveball _
and slammed a home run over the left-field fence. Advantage Mets,
3-2, before the Yankees tied the score on a double by Posada and a
single by Scott Brosius in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   With Tino Martinez slumping, his shoulder sore, Yankee manager
Joe Torre started Posada at first base. For 5 1/2 innings, the
Yankees got away with it. But with Met runners at first and third
and nobody out in the sixth, Posada fielded a grounder and should
have thrown home to cut off the tie-breaking run. Instead, he
stepped on first base, then threw to second to complete a double
play, allowing Piazza to score and give the Mets a short-lived 4-3
lead.
</P>
<P>
   When Torre replaced Irabu later in the inning, a chant of
``Let's go Mets'' reverberated around Shea.
</P>
<P>
   But those who participated were silenced, if only for one night.
The Yankees and Mets play Game 2 of the series Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   INSIDE PITCH
</P>
<P>
   The Mets very nearly turned a triple play in the second inning.
With Tim Raines on second and Jorge Posada on first, Chad Curtis
hit a liner toward the shortstop hole, with Raines breaking from
second. But Rey Ordonez, the Mets' shortstop, dived to his right
and speared the ball, flipped over and started to throw to second,
but held the ball. At that moment, Raines was nearing third and
Posada was more than halfway to second. After his pause, Ordonez
threw to second to double Raines, but the Mets had lost their
chance to get Posada at first, leaving the crowd twittering about
what could have been. &QL;

SPORTS COLUMN: A SEQUEL WORTHY OF THE SANDLOT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 C.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ At about 3:30 Friday afternoon, Manager Joe Torre led
the Yankees into the Shea stadium. This was an odd scene. Normally
the visiting team enters through a back entrance. Friday, the
Yankees sauntered through the Mets bullpen in right field and
walked across the outfield grass.
</P>
<P>
   If it were not for the backdrop of the stadium, with a big-time
scoreboard and tiers of seats, this could have been a team from one
neighborhood coming to play a sandlot game against a cross-town
rival. There were no sport coats, no slacks. Instead, the players
wore jeans and some even wore shorts. Subway apparel for a Subway
Series. Year 2, Game 1, of a series for the battle of New York's
baseball soul.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, in three scintillating games wrapped in the fervor
of a playoff series, the Yankees prevailed two games to one. They
won the rubber game of the series with a game-winning hit in the
10th inning by Tino Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   Friday the series shifted 10 miles and several levels of
ambition down the Grand Central Parkway to Shea Stadium. Publicly,
a number of players said this was simply another game, another
series, three more games on the schedule. Certainly for the
Yankees, who won Friday night, 8-4, and continued to be a team on
track to compile one of the best records ever in baseball, this
series could be seen as an opportunity to gobble up more victories
and the Mets along with them.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for this night, this series, the Mets and Yankees tore off
the labels and cast away the designations. No white collar, no blue
collar; no American League, no National League. This wasn't about
interleague play. These games are about the continuation of a good
old-fashioned knockdown drag-out sandlot game with deep roots.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as I got here, everyone started talking about it,
talking about how exciting it was,'' said Mike Piazza, the Mets'
recently acquired catcher. ``I wondered, `How exciting can it be?'
But you get caught up in the excitement. You try to keep it in
perspective, remind yourself that it's still the middle of the
season but there's no question that there are bragging rights and
pride at stake.''
</P>
<P>
   When Piazza was with Los Angeles last season, the Dodgers played
four games against the Anaheim Angels. ``But it was nothing like
this,'' he said. ``The tradition here goes so far back. Ever since
the Mets were formed, they have been trying to get to that level as
far as tradition is concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   Last season the Yankees were defending champions and the Mets
were in yet another rebuilding year. This season the Mets and
Yankees are trains racing toward each other. The Yankees just took
three of four games from the Braves; the Mets did the same to
Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this is our year to win, there's no question that this is a
great matchup as far as seeing how we do against the cream of both
leagues,'' Piazza said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all of the buildup of a series between teams with
drastically different roots, there is excitement but not
electricity. This year, the stadium is not part of the drama, it
simply houses the drama. A large part of last year's rivalry was
the historic novelty: in the first year of interleague play, the
Mets were making their first regular season appearance at Yankee
Stadium, a place with a physical presence that resonates history.
</P>
<P>
   Shea Stadium isn't drenched in tradition; the Mets don't have to
carry the burden of history week to week, season to season. The
drama and interest are created by the game.
</P>
<P>
   At Shea, there is no neighborhood, per se. The stadium is
surrounded by parkland, an industrial park dotted by clusters of
auto-body shops.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets and Yankees want public money to build new stadiums.
The Mets want an old-style park fashioned after Brooklyn's
long-gone Ebbets Field; Steinbrenner wants to abandon the Bronx for
a new stadium on the West Side of Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   For Brian McRae, the Mets' outfielder, leaving Yankee Stadium
would be a great equalizer for Yankee opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``You drive here and its just a stadium; you drive there and
you're in awe, because it's Yankee Stadium,'' McRae said. ``Even
when I was in Kansas City there was something about that. You got
the train tracks running by, the river, you got the bat outside. If
they move, they got to start all over again.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be like the Cubs moving from Wrigley Field, the Red Sox
moving from Fenway. ``You won't be scared to go to the Bronx to
play the Yankees,'' McRae said, ``because the stadium won't be
there anymore. &QL;

WHO'S ON FIRST? POSADA MAKES UNLIKELY DEBUT
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By JACK CURRY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Jorge Posada, the Yankee catcher, turned first
baseman on a night that happened to be of the biggest of the
season. He was blunt when asked what he would do if he managed the
Mets and saw a neophyte playing first. Posada never hesitated to
guess Bobby Valentine's strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hit it over there,'' Posada said. ``Find out if he can play.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed. Posada conceded he did not know what type of first
baseman he would be. Manager Joe Torre and the batting coach, Chris
Chambliss, a former first baseman, both added that they had never
seen Posada at the position. Imagine that? It was obviously curious
for Torre to allow Posada to make his major league debut at first
as the one-night replacement for the slumping Tino Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's playing first?'' said Martinez, who lobbied Torre to
start against the left-hander Al Leiter and lost. Martinez, who
bats left-handed and who has a sore right shoulder after being hit
by John Rocker on Thursday night, quickly changed his tone of
surprise before saying: ``He will do fine. He's a good athlete.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, a good athlete does not automatically become a good first
baseman. Posada, who was drafted by the Yankees as a shortstop and
often fields grounders during batting practice, said he played
first for Santurce in the Puerto Rican winter league. It was the
first time Posada had made such a revelation. He had said he was
used as a designated hitter in about 20 games while resting his
knees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stop lying to the reporters,'' Derek Jeter shouted to Posada
after he was asked if he had seen his teammate at first while
visiting Puerto Rico. ``You never played first.''
</P>
<P>
   But Posada was at first Friday night, and Tim Raines, who has
spent most of his 18-year career as a leadoff hitter, batted
cleanup against the Mets for the first time in almost nine years.
So Torre used a right-handed-dominated lineup that had a
spring-training flair in a skirmish that means the world to fans in
the five boroughs and beyond and, of course, to George
Steinbrenner, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not your traditional cleanup hitter, but I'll be playing
that role tonight,'' said Raines, who had not batted fourth since
Aug. 29, 1989, with Montreal. ``It's not like I'm going to try and
become a slugger and hit home runs. But it will be nice to hit with
some runners in scoring position.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Raines cackled, which was something Posada was not doing.
While he initially took a carefree attitude to making his debut at
first in this of all contests, the 26-year-old could not hide his
anxiety. How would he react to bunts? Would he know where to be on
cutoffs from the outfield? What if he had to turn a 3-6-3 double
play? And, perhaps most important, would Posada have the proper
footwork around the base?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll find out how comfortable I'll be,'' Posada said. ``I know
I have to catch ground balls. We'll see. I'll be nervous.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, Posada was not alone. When Jeter was asked if Posada
could handle first, he simply said, ``I hope so. I'll let you know
after the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Hideki Irabu, who is a poor defensive player, could compound
Posada's potential difficulties. Valentine knows Irabu's strengths
and weaknesses from having managed him in Japan, and it would not
be surprising for him to instruct his players to push a few bunts
between the mound and first base to see if they cause chaos.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to have the instincts,'' Posada said. ``I've
never played first. I won't be like Tino. It's not going to come
natural to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Chambliss downplayed the presence of a weak-fielding pitcher and
said: ``If you're a good athlete, and he is, you can do it. The
fact that somebody is a good or a bad fielder is not going to
affect the first baseman.''
</P>
<P>
   Torre said he bypassed Martinez because the Yankees follow
Friday night's game with an afternoon game Saturday, and he did not
want the first baseman to irritate a nagging shoulder injury that
has bothered him since the Orioles' Armando Benitez plunked him on
May 21. The manager could have used the veteran Dale Sveum at
first, but he bats left-handed, and the Yankees loaded up on
right-handed hitters. That meant a nervous Posada was the
surprising answer to who was on first for the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's disappointing,'' said Martinez, who is 16 for his last 91
(.176). ``There are three games here. Hopefully, I'll play tomorrow
and the next day. Physically, I'm fine. I can play. I think if I
had been swinging the bat better, I'd be playing.'' &QL;

LEITER LEAVES, AS DOES A LEAD 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: See also BBO-METS-YANKS, BBO-METS-YANKS-O'NEILL) 
(mk) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ If the Mets have had any weakness _ other than their
inability to score runs, of course _ it has been getting from their
starter to their closer. It did not take the Yankees very long to
find that weakness out Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Once Al Leiter departed with a strained left knee with the Mets
clinging to a 4-3 lead, runners on first and second and one out in
the seventh, it was fairly easy to guess what would happen next. On
came the right-handed reliever Mel Rojas. His assignment? Get Paul
O'Neill out.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, manager Bobby Valentine's choice of Rojas was
curious. O'Neill, who was batting .330 entering the game, hits
left-handed. And the Mets have a bevy of left-handers in their
bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   But Dennis Cook, the Mets' only reliable reliever this season
other than the closer John Franco, had pitched two innings Thursday
night and was apparently not available. And for some reason, Rojas
had dominated left-handers, who were hitting .182 against him
versus the .397 clip that right-handers had thrown up against the
Dominican reliever this year.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Rojas, whose main pitch is a split-finger fast ball,
had not allowed a home run to a left-handed hitter this season and
only one at all to a right-hander. But Rojas has had trouble doing
anything right for the Mets in recent appearances.
</P>
<P>
   And it took only one pitch to O'Neill to puncture Valentine's
strategy. O'Neill belted a 3-run homer to left field to put the
Yankees up, 6-4. The Yanks then scored twice more off John Hudek
and Brian Bohanon in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of winning for the seventh straight time, Leiter (9-4)
lost for the first time since May 17 in San Francisco. Of more
concern to the Mets is Leiter's knee, which he apparently injured
when he was late in trying to cover first base on a Derek Jeter
infield hit in the top of the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, Leiter was plagued by problems with his right knee
all year. And he had arthroscopic surgery during the off-season to
repair a cartilage tear. This season, Leiter has emerged, along
with right-hander Rick Reed, as an ace on the Mets staff. If he is
healthy, he almost certainly will be selected to his second
all-star game in a few weeks. If he is not, the Mets could be in
serious trouble the rest of this summer.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most poignant moments at Shea Stadium Friday night
came when Yogi Berra tossed out the ceremonial first pitch to a
reverent standing ovation, a salute that included nearly the entire
Yankee squad on the top step of the visiting team's dugout.
</P>
<P>
   The 73-year-old Berra, who had a Hall of Fame playing career
with the Yankees before managing both the Yankees and the Mets, has
not been back to Yankee Stadium since George Steinbrenner fired him
as manager 16 games into the 1985 season. He has been to Shea at
least three times this season.
</P>
<P>
   What, Berra was asked, would it take for him to go back to the
South Bronx? ``I don't know,'' Berra said.
</P>
<P>
   Has Steinbrenner ever invited him back? ``I think he has, by
somebody else,'' Berra answered, a smile creeping over his face.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Berra did not say it, it was obvious that he still
feels slighted by the Yankee owner. But not by the Mets, who once
fired Berra, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least Grant called me up when he fired me; one guy
didn't,'' Berra said, referring to the former Mets chairman M.
Donald Grant and Steinbrenner. ``At least they told you, you got
fired. Then you can't say anything.''
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to imagine Berra ever being at a loss for words. (In
recalling the Mets' September comeback in 1973, Berra said,
``That's where I said, `It ain't over till it's over.' We had to
play the teams we had to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Berra said, he has spoken to Steinbrenner since his firing,
the last time two years ago at the funeral of Mel Allen, the
legendary Yankee broadcaster. ``I talk to him if I see him,'' Berra
said of Steinbrenner.
</P>
<P>
   Has the owner ever said, `Please come back'? ``He's never said
that,'' Berra said.
</P>
<P>
   Would Berra ever return to Yankee Stadium should Steinbrenner
turn the team over to his sons? ``That I don't know, either,''
Berra said. ``Even if he does, he'll be there.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Berra said he pulls for both the Yankees and the Mets,
even though he was noncommittal about whom he was rooting for this
weekend. As for his feelings about Steinbrenner's wish to move the
Yankees into a new stadium and away from the Bronx, Berra said of
the stadium he has not visited in more than a decade: ``I'd like to
see them stay there and fix it up. It's a tradition, like the
Statue of Liberty.''
</P>
<P>
   Kind of like Yogi Berra.

DODGERS' NEW OWNERS LIED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ To sum it all up:
</P>
<P>
   They lied.
</P>
<P>
   In the Dodgertown lounge, the ``Cheers''-like bar in Vero Beach,
Fla., the day the team's sale was approved by major-league owners,
the men from Fox assembled club employees and reassured them that
no sweeping changes lay ahead.
</P>
<P>
   In TV interviews, the men from Fox said they would allow the
people already running the team to continue doing it in their own
successful way.
</P>
<P>
   In radio interviews, the men from Fox said don't worry about the
subtle changes in hallowed Dodger Stadium, they had nothing but
respect for Los Angeles Dodgers traditions.
</P>
<P>
   They lied.
</P>
<P>
   They can put any spin they want on the five weeks that shook Los
Angeles, starting with the Mike Piazza trade and continuing with
the firings of Fred Claire, Bill Russell and most of the coaching
staff. They can say circumstances changed, that those promises no
longer applied. But that doesn't excuse them.
</P>
<P>
   They've made sweeping changes, replaced the men in charge of the
front office and dugout with rookies, and been thoroughly
insensitive to the traditionalist nature of Dodgers fans, all after
going out of their way to say they wouldn't.
</P>
<P>
   And maybe it's not what they've done with the team _ each trade
and firing is defensible in its own right _ as much as the clumsy
way they've done it.
</P>
<P>
   Like firing general manager Claire and manager Russell, each
popular in what used to be thought of as the Dodgers family, only
hours after the death of Al Campanis, the grandfatherly former GM.
Yes, club president Bob Graziano had made up his mind about the
firings and Peter O'Malley taught him to act on decisions
immediately, but would waiting one day have hurt anything?
</P>
<P>
   Like trotting out softball-style ``Think Blue Week'' jerseys,
and debuting an eye-straining new crisscross design in the infield
grass, on the Wednesday night that 30 years of Dodgers coaching
experience was let go. It might surprise the Fox people, but such
little things as uniforms and mowing patterns really matter to
fans, and when they change at the same time as the rest of the
Dodgers world seems to be exploding, fans wonder if anything is
sacred.
</P>
<P>
   A fan roots for his favorite players. Then suppose they're
traded away. Now he roots for something he knows vaguely as The
Club _ meaning, really, the institutional memory borne by
fourth-decade employees like Claire and Russell. Then suppose
employees like that are fired. Now he roots for whatever is
symbolized by the crisp white of a uniform. Then suppose he can't
even count on that anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Did they know they were lying? Probably not.
</P>
<P>
   They didn't know the Dodgers would have virtually the same
record as the Pittsburgh Pirates heading into a late-June series.
They didn't know they'd have any reason to tell anybody they're
fired _ or, as Claire remembered Graziano's corporatespeak, ``Fred,
I can't recommend you continuing on a go-forward basis.''
</P>
<P>
   But if all Graziano and Fox superiors Chase Carey and Peter
Chernin, none of them with baseball backgrounds, are doing is
reacting to a bad half-season, it's fair to worry they'll be firing
and reassigning every time the team disappoints for 80 games, never
mind the role that injuries play.
</P>
<P>
   The sense now is the Dodgers are run by a new president,
Graziano, frantic to justify himself, and a new GM, Tom Lasorda,
and manager, Glenn Hoffman, hell-bent on earning permanent jobs,
and the effect will be a whirlwind.
</P>
<P>
   When the dust settles, will the Dodgers be any closer to a World
Series than they were April 1?
</P>
<P>
   What the new brass might fail to realize is how close that team
in spring training was to good enough, and, for that matter, how
close this one is.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers had this kind of season in 1979. Two years later,
the only substantial changes being the emergence of Fernando
Valenzuela and Steve Howe from the farm system, they won the World
Series.
</P>
<P>
   They had this kind of season in 1986 and '87. In '88, after
signing Kirk Gibson and making a lot of quiet roster changes, they
won the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers fans kind of liked that, the way patience paid off, the
redemption of last year's buffoons.
</P>
<P>
   A Russell-hating fan said to me this week: ``Russell was an
idiot. But he was our idiot.''

   The fans' fears have come true _ sweeping changes, executed with
all the delicacy of a six-mile-wide comet.
</P>
<P>
   It's exactly what we were told wouldn't happen, back in the
Dodgertown lounge, the ``Cheers''-like bar in Vero Beach where, the
last time we were there, everybody knew your name.

KIDS RECOVER BASEBALL TOURNAMENT DREAM 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Mike Burghardt and his son Josh dreamed of walking on hallowed
grass and hearing the crack of leather on wood in Cooperstown,
N.Y., legendary home of baseball.
</P>
<P>
   But the Phoenix boy's chance to play alongside and against the
nation's best young ballplayers almost slipped away when his team
was allegedly swindled out of $13,000 raised it for the event.
</P>
<P>
   Josh's team, the Arizona Copperheads, was one of 33 teams across
the country that lost entrance fees raised by selling phone cards
before the tournament began.
</P>
<P>
   With help from several businesses and individuals, Josh and
Mike's dream came true Friday. A plane bearing 27 Copperheads and
three coaches left Sky Harbor International Airport en route to New
York.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona Copperheads, composed of players from 9 to 12 years
old, will compete in the Cooperstown Dreams Park tournament during
the next two weeks. But their chance of getting there looked slim
in the days leading to their trip.
</P>
<P>
   The team coaches and parents financed the trip by selling
telephone calling cards for a Nevada-based company called
Timecards. According to tournament officials, one or more
executives with Timecards ran off with the money from Arizona and
32 other states.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was surprised, overwhelmed, shocked,'' said Lou Presutti, a
director with the tournament who had worked successfully with
Timecards before. ``The kids' hard work, their dreams of coming to
Cooperstown and their anticipation of working hard at something was
definitely in the balance.''
</P>
<P>
   To recover the money, Coach Craig Bartenhagen contacted Valley
television and radio stations on June 23 to get the word out.
</P>
<P>
   Donations quickly rolled in. One woman donated $500, asking in
return that a picture of the team hang next to Ted Williams in the
Baseball Hall of Fame. A Saratoga, N.Y., widow gave the last $1,000
of her husband's memorial fund to the team after hearing from a
daughter in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Armor-Deck, a home-improvement company based in Tempe,
contributed $1,000. Diamondback Charities auctioned off a Bank One
Ballpark suite for $1,500, which was donated to the team.
</P>
<P>
   The support overwhelmed Bartenhagen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It tugs a lot of strings of the heart,'' he said. ``There is
so much negative out there. Any time you turn on the news, there's
something bad happening. But there's actually a lot more good than
you would think.''
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Sunny, helped coordinate the donations as they
arrived. One of her favorites was a $3 money order.
</P>
<P>
   ``That money order was as important to that person as $1,000 was
to someone else,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The state Attorney General's Office has not received a formal
complaint about the alleged embezzlement. The office will continue
its investigation when the Copperheads return from New York.
</P>
<P>
   Timecards, which recently changed its name to Future Stars of
America, according the Cooperstown Dreams Park administrators, did
not return phone calls Friday. &QL;

BILLBOARD SIGN SPURS FREE SPEECH QUESTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RUBEN NAVARRETTE JR.  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Got something to say? Lease a billboard. But hurt someone's
feelings, and you could get a crash course in broken contracts and
the limits of free speech.
</P>
<P>
   Even though a California sign bemoaning illegal immigration has
been removed, the controversy rages on amid charges that free
speech has been trampled upon by billboard executives who put
profits and public relations before the First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the physical confrontation that authorities have
feared may yet materialize Saturday as dozens of billboard
supporters intent on resurrecting it flock to the state line. They
likely will be met there by counterprotesters who find the sign
racist and offensive.
</P>
<P>
   The billboard, which was intended to be seen by thousands but
has now been viewed by millions, was located near the California
desert town of Blythe on Interstate 10. It read, ``Welcome to
California, the illegal immigration state. Don't let this happen to
your state.''
</P>
<P>
   That message, scripted by the Southern California-based
California Coalition for Immigration Reform, infuriated Mario
Obledo, a 66-year-old lawyer and veteran of the Hispanic civil
rights movement who threatened to deface the sign.
</P>
<P>
   Obledo's threat panicked the sign's owner, Martin Media of Paso
Robles, Calif., which removed the sign Tuesday and issued a refund
to the Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe in free speech,'' said Connie Wauhob, the company's
general manager, from her offices in Fort Mojave. ``But when our
property was threatened, we had to draw the line.''
</P>
<P>
   While Wauhob would not confirm the amount of the agreement,
sources estimate it to have been close to $4,000 for a one-year
lease. The contract apparently contained a clause under which
either party could cancel it, as Martin did.
</P>
<P>
   Sources in the billboard industry say companies often retain the
right to cancel agreements because of public reaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we receive complaints from the public that a specific copy
is perceived as being in poor taste, we'll remove it,'' said Tom
Wisz, communications director for Phoenix-based Outdoor Systems,
Inc., the nation's largest outdoor media company.
</P>
<P>
   And according to a representative of the Washington-based
Outdoor Advertising Association of America, a good way to avoid
negative public reaction is to know your audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be able to judge the community and know what they
might find offensive,'' said Ruth Segal, executive vice president
for governmental affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Segal said that deciding what constitutes bad taste on a
billboard is a source of constant debate within an industry that
aims to catch the attention of passersby in ways that are, by
design, often provocative and controversial.
</P>
<P>
   And nowhere is that debate hotter than with the recently
intensified media battle between tobacco advertisers and
government-sponsored ef forts to discourage smoking, which are
becoming increasingly graphic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are high-impact messages,'' Segal said.
</P>
<P>
   While the tobacco ads are notoriously straightforward, other
billboard messages raise concerns because of their ambiguity.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, in Duluth, Minn., a family recreation park
recently came up with what it considered a clever slogan for
challenging parents to play games with their children. The
billboard blared: ``Beat Your Kids!'' and then continued, in
smaller letters underneath, ``. . . or let them win at Castle
Golf.'' The sign was removed by representatives of the amusement
park after the mayor of Duluth complained that it was offensive.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not the California controversy could have been
avoided, it came along at an unfortunate time for Martin Media,
which is being purchased by Chancellor Media Corp., an owner of
radio stations, for an estimated $610 million. Even though the sale
was announced just one day before the billboard was removed, Wauhob
denied that the merger had any impact.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Coe confirmed that the Coalition intended to sue
Obledo, but not for interfering with the group's First Amendment
rights.
</P>
<P>
   That, legal scholars agree, is wise, given that First Amendment
protection extends to only acts by government. As a result, acts by
private citizens or companies to limit speech are rarely
actionable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since government is not censoring anything in this case,
there's technically no constitutional problem with what's
happened,'' said Paul Bender, former dean of Arizona State
University's College of Law.
</P>
<P>
   And so, Coe said, the group intends to sue Obledo for
interfering with a contractual agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Obledo said Friday that he would ``welcome a lawsuit'' as a
forum to express his views.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Wauhob said that, despite the criticism it has
received, the company stands by its decision. It simply had, she
said, no idea just how heated the response would be.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew it would be controversial,'' she said, ``but not this
controversial.'' &QL;
