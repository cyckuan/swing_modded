FAA PROBE SET FOR AVIATION FACIITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANDREW SCHNEIDER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ As a team of special Federal Aviation Administration
investigators prepare to do a major examination of B.F. Goodrich
Aerospace, the company says it has made significant improvements in
areas which should enable them to better follow government
regulations.
</P>
<P>
   The Everett company, which says it is the nation's largest
independent maintenance facility for commercial aircraft, has long
been the target of increased FAA scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   In February, the Post-Intelligencer reported that FAA inspectors
had recommended closing the sprawling facility because of a series
of violations of FAA regulations and ``dangerously incompetent
work'' on several jetliners.
</P>
<P>
   Another inspector told agency lawyers that BF Goodrich's
``violations raise significant concerns for safety and clearly
raise the potential of a catastrophic failure leading to a crash.''
</P>
<P>
   Incidents noted by the FAA included cases where planes were
released for service with missing bolts, leaking fuel tanks and
other incomplete or improper repairs.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA found that the company used under-trained mechanics
doing flight-critical repairs, unqualified inspectors signing off
on work improperly done, incorrect parts and tools.
</P>
<P>
   But FAA managers said they would rather allow the plant to
remain open under increased surveillance.
</P>
<P>
   Pierre Michel, the FAA's principal maintenance inspector for the
facility, ran a one-man show there until last summer, when four
other inspectors were added to his team. That's still far less than
the dozen he requested.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the Seattle-based safety inspectors say they are
eager to have the six-person team of national FAA experts check out
the operation, which includes repairs, heavy maintenance,
modifications and inspections on jets owned by dozens of passenger
carriers such as United, Northwest, Continental and Southwest.
</P>
<P>
   The special team is to start its work next week.
</P>
<P>
   BF Goodrich managers said in February that Michel and his
colleagues overstated the severity of the violations and that ``all
problems cited have been addressed and resolved.''
</P>
<P>
   But Thursday the FAA said 13 violations or administrative
actions have been filed against the company so far this year.
Inspectors say several other cases are being examined.
</P>
<P>
   Some inspectors continue to express concern over safety
deficiencies at the plant and FAA lawyers have again been asked to
consider sanctions beyond the $1,100 maximum allowed per violation.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, officials at the Everett plant _ the largest of BF
Goodrich's 25 repair facilities worldwide _ insist the FAA has
given the plant a clean bill of health.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA may not agree with that characterization.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure the FAA would use the term `clean bill of
health,''' said FAA spokeswoman Kirsti Dunn. ``Goodrich has
implemented a series of improvements, but the FAA would say it's a
little too soon to measure the effectiveness of those programs.''
</P>
<P>
   Following the Post-Intelligencer report in February, BF Goodrich
brought in a team of outside experts to examine operations at the
Everett plant. Six weeks ago, the leader of that team, William
White, former deputy director of the FAA's Flight Standards
Service, briefed the FAA on some of his findings.
</P>
<P>
   White noted only one area of major concern or deficiency, which
dealt with repair manuals, said BF Goodrich spokeswoman Sherry
Bergstrom. But two FAA safety specialists who attended that
briefing said White confirmed shortcomings identified by the FAA.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, BF Goodrich said it has instituted an ``action plan''
to improve the ``safety and quality'' of work at the plant.
</P>
<P>
   The effort includes hiring two additional senior managers: A
training director and a director of regulatory compliance, quality
assurance and safety.
</P>
<P>
   The company also pledged to improve its inspection manuals,
Bergstrom said.
</P>
<P>
   And in what Bergstrom called an unrelated move, the company
Thursday announced the resignation of a top official at the Everett
plant.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Avery, vice president of the Maintenance, Repair and
Overhaul Group in Everett, resigned effective Aug. 31 after 32
years with the company. In a letter released to the media, Avery
said the move was ``to make a major change in my work and personal
life.''

BAVASI SAYS SON IS DOING GOOD JOB
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.1999 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; DENVER _ Anaheim Angels general manager Bill Bavasi finds
himself in the final year of his contract with the Angels, and it
so happens it's been his most difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Bavasi has seen his team decimated by an inordinate number of
injuries -- even by the Angels' standards. And there was the
dissension in the clubhouse over manager Terry Collins.
</P>
<P>
   The team has been in last place since May 4, and Bavasi has been
tempted to make trades. But at what cost? Bavasi is careful not to
trash all he and the organization have built for a quick fix.
</P>
<P>
   So how does Bavasi's performance rate? Bavasi's bosses at Disney
won't tell and Bavasi himself won't talk about his contract
situation, but there is a pretty good judge down south near San
Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Bavasi's father, Buzzie, the former general manager of the
Brooklyn and Los Angeles Dodgers, the Angels and president of the
Padres, says Bill is doing just fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never went through anything like he's gone through, the
elder Bavasi said. ``I thought he handled the Collins situation
well. Somebody has to be boss. Who would he rather have unhappy --
the players or (Disney chairman and CEO) Michael Eisner? I know
what my answer would be.
</P>
<P>
   Bavasi related a story from his days in Brooklyn when Jackie
Robinson had a problem with manager Walter Alston in 1954.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jackie, as he would do, popped off about Walter not having any
(major league) background, Bavasi said. ``So he called Jackie into
his office and closed and locked the door. He said `Jackie, I heard
what you we're saying. And unless you apologize, only one of us is
leaving this room.' Jackie apologized.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, Walter was 230 pounds, and Terry is 160 pounds. But
I think Billy had it right. I told him I wasn't interested in happy
players, I'm interested in good players.
</P>
<P>
   One of Bavasi's immediate goals is to help the offense, but the
Angels hitters have shown signs lately they are breaking out of
their season-long slump. And with outfielders Tim Salmon and Jim
Edmonds beginning to make significant progress in their recoveries
from injuries, a deal for offense might not happen.
</P>
<P>
   In the six games since the Angels were swept by the Rangers, the
Angels are hitting .316 (67 for 212) and are averaging 6.7 per runs
per game. It's a noticeable improvement from their season average
of .259 and 4.3 runs per game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's happening for us now, said Mo Vaughn, who has a
team-leading 17 homers and 55 RBIs. ``We're taking a solid approach
up there and putting together good at-bats. The team is showing we
can hit the ball where it's pitched, and that's what he have to do.
I've said it a thousand times.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Greene, optioned to triple-A Edmonton on Tuesday, did not
join the club in Oklahoma City on Thursday as planned. He missed
his flight.
</P>
<P>
   Greene, though, will join the Trappers in an effort to correct
his flawed stroke. He's hitting .197 with runners in scoring
position and has looked ugly at the plate recently, swinging at
pitches out of the strikezone with regularity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to be there very long, Greene promised.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels resume interleague play with a three-game series
against the Colorado Rockies in Denver beginning tonight. Pitching
matchups for the series: Tonight (6:05) -- Chuck Finley (4-9, 5.52
ERA) vs. Darryl Kile (5-6, 5.57); Saturday (5:05) -- Omar Olivares
(7-6, 3.26) vs. Pedro Astacio (8-7, 5.30); Sunday (12:05) -- Mike
Fyhrie (0-0, 2.57) vs. Bobby Jones (4-7, 5.85).

<TEXT>
<P>
   EAGLE LAKE, Texas _ An Amtrak train carrying 234 passengers hit
a tanker truck at a rural crossing Thursday and derailed, injuring
18 people, including the engineer and his assistant.
</P>
<P>
   The truck, which was hauling a saltwater disposal tank, crossed
the tracks in front of the eastbound Sunset Limited just before
noon near Eagle Lake, about 65 miles west of Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Two locomotives and seven of the train's 10 cars jumped the
tracks, with the engine landing on its side perpendicular to the
tracks. The train, en route from Los Angeles to Orlando, Fla., had
stopped in San Antonio and was heading toward its next stop in
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   There were no warning lights or crossing gates at the crossing,
which was on a short dirt road leading from a rice field onto U.S.
90A.
</P>
<P>
   The truck driver, Jason David Bubela, 21, of El Campo, was not
seriously injured, police said. Police said they are considering
possible charges against the driver. The truck, which police say
may have had bad brakes, is owned by Key Energy Services of
Bryan-College Station, which is conducting its own investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, these crossing accidents happen all too
often,'' Amtrak spokesman Derrick James said. ``People just don't
seem to want to wait.'' &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Mark Davis, a spokesman for Union Pacific, owners of the track,
said an accident occurred at the same crossing three weeks ago when
an empty freight train clipped the back of a grain truck. The
wreck, however, was termed minor. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Vernon Stevenson, 32, of Eagle Lake, was using a portable
restroom near the tracks when the accident happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was coming out, and I heard all this commotion,'' said
Stevenson, who works at Rice Industries, behind the Colorado County
Rice Mill. ``The train just went up and went to flipping like. It
was like an explosion. It scared me so bad. I took off running.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking that engine was coming into my car,'' said
Tommy Stewart, the train's head conductor, who was two cars behind
the engine. ``Nobody in my car was bleeding, and everybody could
walk, so I jumped out and saw my engineer on the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the assistant engineer was trapped ``and he had a big
gash in his head. He was talking to me, though.''
</P>
<P>
   Crew members and rescuers used a sledgehammer to break a window
and pulled out the assistant engineer, Ed Guidon. He and engineer
J.D. Wood were in stable condition Thursday evening at Rice Medical
Center in Eagle Lake. &UR;  &LR; Their hometowns were not immediately known &UR; .
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Sixteen other passengers and crew members were treated for
bruises, cuts and heat exhaustion from standing in the 90-degree
heat awaiting transportation into Eagle Lake, about five miles
away.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, who spent the afternoon at the wreck site after a short
trip to the hospital to get his elbow X-rayed, said he planned to
check on his passengers at a makeshift shelter at the local
community center before heading home to Columbus.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then,'' he said, ``I might go buy a bottle of whiskey. We were
very lucky.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the passengers were Cindy and Jack McCain, the wife and
13-year-old son of presidential candidate and Arizona Sen. John
McCain, who were on their way to Florida on vacation. Authorities
said neither was hurt. They took a private plane to Florida a few
hours after the accident.
</P>
<P>
   Other passengers were taken in school buses to the Eagle Lake
Community Center, where volunteers set up a first-aid station and
served barbecue and pizza donated by local restaurants. The
passengers later were bused to Houston, where Amtrak officials
planned to reunite them with their luggage and arrange other
transportation.

NEW NBA RULES TO GET TESTED AT PYRAMID
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LONG BEACH, Calif. _ If you embrace only one rule change in pro
basketball this summer, it should be the guarantee that no lockout
will arise to estrange the NBA from its offseason home in Long
Beach.
</P>
<P>
   The other rules aren't bad, though.
</P>
<P>
   Declaring Long Beach State's Pyramid as a lockout-free zone
allows great optimism to accompany today's tipoff of the Fila
Summer Pro League. Now in its fifth run at LBSU, this summer of
slam offers 115 games over the next 24 days, framed by sightings of
NBA players in various stages of enlightenment.
</P>
<P>
   Without NBA-sanctioned participation last year, the league was
obliged to grind through its 29th season.
</P>
<P>
   This year, with 12 NBA teams enrolled in summer school, any ol'
lottery pick or sneaker-commercial hotshot might roll in to do a
little crowd-pleasing maintenance on his game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year we had a tough summer,'' said Washington Wizard and
ex-UCLA star Tracy Murray, who stopped by the Pyramid to pay his
respects at Thursday's press conference. ``A lot of guys were
afraid of getting hurt during the lockout. But this league is very
important; it helps gives you an idea of what to expect when it's
time to go to training camp.''
</P>
<P>
   NBA rules changes include:
</P>
<P>
   __ A five-second limit for a dribbler who's being defended below
the free-throw line.
</P>
<P>
   __ Small-but-crucial alteration of the complex and unpopular
illegal- defense guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   __ A less-than-generous reset of the 24-second clock if a foul
occurs with less than 14 ticks remaining. In that instance, the
clock will be turned back to 14, rather than the original,
action-strangling 24 of the old days.

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; !text! &LR; CLAREMONT _ In China, a nation of 1.2 billion, it's
estimated that only 10,000 women play soccer.
</P>
<P>
   And though the immense soccer potential of the country has yet
to be fully unleashed, China already has a huge head start on most
of the rest of the world when it comes to success.
</P>
<P>
   China will play the United States on Saturday at the Rose Bowl
in the 1999 Women's World Cup final, and leading the way will be a
player who doesn't seem to fit the typical image many have of life
in that country. Sun Wen is a pioneer in many ways, but the
26-year-old forward was one of soccer's elite players in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
   This year's tournament has done nothing to dispel that notion.
Sun is tied with Brazil's Sissi for the lead in goals scored with
seven, including two in the 5-0 semifinal victory over Norway.
</P>
<P>
   Sun certainly has her admirers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen her over the last decade and she's playing the best
soccer of her life,'' said U.S. assistant coach Lauren Gregg. ``We
have tremendous respect for her.''
</P>
<P>
   And respect doesn't come from only Sun's opponents but also
teammates, fans and most others who come into contact with her
jovial personality and humble nature. Sound familiar, Mia Hamm
fans?
</P>
<P>
   But Sun is far from being the marketing icon Hamm has become. At
this point, her only exposure has been as part of an Adidas
campaign that focuses on a number of World Cup players.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. coach Tony DiCicco said Hamm and Sun are different players.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mia's a bit faster and a bit better with the dribble,''
DiCicco said. ``Sun Wen is an artist, finding space for herself and
creating space. They're both outstanding passers; they're both
excellent goal scorers. They're two of the best players in the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   To place Sun in that category might seem like a stretch on the
surface, considering the numerous obstacles she faced in
cultivating her game in her homeland. But the statement couldn't be
truer.
</P>
<P>
   As rigid as the Chinese seem to be, even when it comes to
training sessions and preparation for Saturday's game, Sun seems
relaxed _ almost at peace, if you will. She prefers to treat the
moment with the wide-eyed exuberance it deserves.
</P>
<P>
   But her life isn't only soccer. Some of her poetry has been
published in newspapers, she studies Chinese literature at Shanghai
University and she loves to sing karaoke. She even belted out a
rendition of Elton John's ``Candle in the Wind'' for a group of
reporters earlier this week at Pomona College.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Sun remembers what it has been like for most young girls
in China who dream of playing soccer at the highest level.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most fathers cannot accept girls playing soccer,'' Sun said.
``It's the culture. Girls are supposed to be shy and studious and
not so active.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sun said she was lucky to have a father who did not feel
that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father was a real soccer fan, a former player, and he
encouraged me to play,'' Sun said. ``I started to play when I was
10 and started regular training when I was 13. My father is very
proud now.''
</P>
<P>
   He and an entire nation have good reason to be, with China on
the doorstep of an historic game Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   China has been angling for revenge since losing to the U.S. 2-1
in the gold- medal game at the '96 Summer Olympics. Sun scored the
lone Chinese goal that day. She also scored a goal in each of
China's two victories against the U.S. earlier this year, including
one in the Algarve Cup final in Portugal, further signifying her
status as a prime-time player.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's an incredible forward and she's very good in every
aspect of her game,'' said U.S. defender Kate Sobrero, who likely
will draw the assignment of marking the 5-foot-4, 128-pound Sun.
``She's a complete forward. And that says a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Norway assistant coach Jarl Torske shakes his head when asked
about how a team should deal with Sun. His team certainly couldn't
in the semifinals. But Torske does have his own impressions of what
makes Sun shine.
</P>
<P>
   ``One on one, she's a very good player,'' Torske said. ``She's
able to turn away from her opponent and she seems to have a huge
repertoire. She's hard to mark because she's always moving. She's
as close to a complete player as I've seen, and I don't think she
has ever been as good as this.''
</P>
<P>
   Sun would prefer not to hear such talk, focusing instead on what
her team is trying to accomplish.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very, very important that we win now,'' she said, ``for
ourselves and for China.'' &UR; !dlim!!end! &LR;  &QL;

SPECIAL DELIVERY: BABY IS BORN OUTSIDE CONVENIENCE STORE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRISTINE VENDEL  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- As a QuikTrip cashier, Rusty Suhr is used to
helping people -- but not like this.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the 22-year-old Suhr helped a woman deliver her
baby in the front seat of a truck in the parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was definitely beyond the call of duty,'' said the woman,
Wendy Levy of Odessa. ``Not everyone would step right in like that
and help.''
</P>
<P>
   Suhr visited Levy, 31, and her daughter, Sheridan Micheala Levy,
Thursday at Truman Medical Center. Levy and Sheridan, who weighs 7
pounds, 2 ounces, were doing fine.
</P>
<P>
   The family reminisced about Wednesday's early arrival for
Sheridan, who wasn't due until July 17.
</P>
<P>
   Levy said she had driven to Kansas City on Wednesday for a
doctor appointment and met her boyfriend, Russell Rowlett, at his
job at 12th Street and Hardesty Avenue for lunch. They sat in the
parking lot and Levy said she began having abdominal pains.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just figured they were false labor pains,'' said Levy, who
also has a 5-year-old daughter. ``But then they started getting
worse and I said to Russell, `You're going to have to take me to
the hospital now!' ''
</P>
<P>
   Rowlett, 27, drove toward Truman Medical Center East, where
Levy's doctor is, but her water broke. He turned in the QuikTrip
parking lot at Truman Road and Ewing Avenue, parked his car and ran
inside, leaving his truck door open.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone call 911!'' he yelled at Suhr, the first clerk he saw.
</P>
<P>
   Suhr tossed the cordless telephone to his manager, who called
911, and Suhr ran outside to the 1977 Chevrolet truck. Levy lay
across the seat and could feel the baby's head coming out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a nervous wreck,'' Rowlett said. ``Rusty said he had
just had a baby six months ago so I said, `OK, here you go. You
have more recent experience.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Suhr said he didn't have time to think about what he was doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just telling her everything was going to be OK,'' Suhr
said.
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes, the baby was out.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Hoek, an ambulance dispatcher, talked to Suhr on the
telephone and advised him to tie the umbilical cord off with a
shoestring. Suhr said he also cleared out the baby's mouth with his
little finger and wrapped her in a QuikTrip towel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the situation, everything went perfectly,'' Suhr said.
</P>
<P>
   Hoek said it was the fourth time in his 8-year dispatch career
at Metropolitan Ambulance Services Trust that he had helped in a
baby delivery over the telephone.

the calls from home, but the parking lot at a QuikTrip? That is
strange.''

SUN ALWAYS SHINES
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   CLAREMONT, Calif. _ In China, a nation of 1.2 billion, it's
estimated that only 10,000 women play soccer.
</P>
<P>
   And though the immense soccer potential of the country has yet
to be fully unleashed, China already has a huge head start on most
of the rest of the world when it comes to success.
</P>
<P>
   China will play the United States on Saturday at the Rose Bowl
in the 1999 Women's World Cup final, and leading the way will be a
player who doesn't seem to fit the typical image many have of life
in that country. Sun Wen is a pioneer in many ways, but the
26-year-old forward was one of soccer's elite players in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
   This year's tournament has done nothing to dispel that notion.
Sun is tied with Brazil's Sissi for the lead in goals scored with
seven, including two in the 5-0 semifinal victory over Norway.
</P>
<P>
   Sun certainly has her admirers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen her over the last decade and she's playing the best
soccer of her life,'' said U.S. assistant coach Lauren Gregg. ``We
have tremendous respect for her.''
</P>
<P>
   And respect doesn't come from only Sun's opponents but also
teammates, fans and most others who come into contact with her
jovial personality and humble nature. Sound familiar, Mia Hamm
fans?
</P>
<P>
   But Sun is far from being the marketing icon Hamm has become. At
this point, her only exposure has been as part of an Adidas
campaign that focuses on a number of World Cup players.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. coach Tony DiCicco said Hamm and Sun are different players.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mia's a bit faster and a bit better with the dribble,''
DiCicco said. ``Sun Wen is an artist, finding space for herself and
creating space. They're both outstanding passers; they're both
excellent goal scorers. They're two of the best players in the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   To place Sun in that category might seem like a stretch on the
surface, considering the numerous obstacles she faced in
cultivating her game in her homeland. But the statement couldn't be
truer.
</P>
<P>
   As rigid as the Chinese seem to be, even when it comes to
training sessions and preparation for Saturday's game, Sun seems
relaxed _ almost at peace, if you will. She prefers to treat the
moment with the wide-eyed exuberance it deserves.
</P>
<P>
   But her life isn't only soccer. Some of her poetry has been
published in newspapers, she studies Chinese literature at Shanghai
University and she loves to sing karaoke. She even belted out a
rendition of Elton John's ``Candle in the Wind'' for a group of
reporters earlier this week at Pomona College.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Sun remembers what it has been like for most young girls
in China who dream of playing soccer at the highest level.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most fathers cannot accept girls playing soccer,'' Sun said.
``It's the culture. Girls are supposed to be shy and studious and
not so active.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sun said she was lucky to have a father who did not feel
that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father was a real soccer fan, a former player, and he
encouraged me to play,'' Sun said. ``I started to play when I was
10 and started regular training when I was 13. My father is very
proud now.''
</P>
<P>
   He and an entire nation have good reason to be, with China on
the doorstep of an historic game Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   China has been angling for revenge since losing to the U.S. 2-1
in the gold- medal game at the '96 Summer Olympics. Sun scored the
lone Chinese goal that day. She also scored a goal in each of
China's two victories against the U.S. earlier this year, including
one in the Algarve Cup final in Portugal, further signifying her
status as a prime-time player.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's an incredible forward and she's very good in every
aspect of her game,'' said U.S. defender Kate Sobrero, who likely
will draw the assignment of marking the 5-foot-4, 128-pound Sun.
``She's a complete forward. And that says a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Norway assistant coach Jarl Torske shakes his head when asked
about how a team should deal with Sun. His team certainly couldn't
in the semifinals. But Torske does have his own impressions of what
makes Sun shine.
</P>
<P>
   ``One on one, she's a very good player,'' Torske said. ``She's
able to turn away from her opponent and she seems to have a huge
repertoire. She's hard to mark because she's always moving. She's
as close to a complete player as I've seen, and I don't think she
has ever been as good as this.''
</P>
<P>
   Sun would prefer not to hear such talk, focusing instead on what
her team is trying to accomplish.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very, very important that we win now,'' she said, ``for
ourselves and for China.''

CRITICISM OF PROPOSED MEDICARE DRUG BENEFIT IS OFF THE MARK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most criticism of the push for Medicare prescription drug
coverage is valid but misses the point of the program.
</P>
<P>
   Prescription drugs are the biggest medical expense for many
senior citizens. The heart-bypass surgeries Medicare underwrites
may be godsends for those relative few needing such heroic
procedures, but it's the unreimbursed, out-of-pocket drain of drug
purchases that relatively more senior citizens have the most
difficulty dealing with.
</P>
<P>
   For every ailing senior for whom Medicare-covered surgery is
indicated, there are many more whose physician visits end with the
simple writing of a prescription whose cost isn't covered by
Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   But, say opponents of adding the drug benefit, many
beneficiaries already have private supplemental insurance to cover
drug therapy expenses. This means the proposed benefit isn't needed
and will only encourage those paying their own way to become
Medicare free riders.
</P>
<P>
   This argument is a good example of how critics miss the point.
Any national health insurance program worthy of the name should
cover the most pressing expense faced by most of the program's
beneficiaries. To do otherwise is not only morally indefensible,
but also nonsensical given the wherewithal of drugs to make
riskier, more expensive treatments unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, many seniors can't afford supplemental private-policy
coverage for prescriptions. Should their needs be dismissed simply
because many others are able to afford private coverage? Besides,
Medicare isn't supposed to differentiate on the basis of economic
status. Like Social Security, it was set up as a universal benefit
to avoid the welfare stigma.
</P>
<P>
   Critics also say that even as defensible as drug coverage may
be, morally and economically, it's beyond the scope of a program
already sliding into insolvency. This is a point well taken,
because Medicare's widely publicized financial problems are indeed
critical. But this argument also misses the point.
</P>
<P>
   If Medicare is going broke, it's because it's badly
administered. Mismanagement is no excuse for the program not to
assume its rightful responsibilities, of which drug coverage should
be one. If Medicare's broke, which it is, it should be fixed.
</P>
<P>
   The first step toward fixing it would be to remove it from
government control. A blue-ribbon panel recommended a move in this
direction recently but was rebuffed by the administration. A key
recommendation was to issue vouchers with which seniors could buy
their own health insurance tailored to their specific needs.
</P>
<P>
   Having rejected such sensible advice, the administration chose
to push a plan to increase Medicare's outgo despite its inadequate
income, while ignoring the program's anachronistic flaws.
</P>
<P>
   The White House says its plan will ensure that drug coverage
will mostly finance itself, but no reasonable person can believe
this. The history of government entitlements is lowball cost
estimates going in and budget-busting outlays after the program is
running full steam.
</P>
<P>
   If the drug benefit is approved and Medicare's bankruptcy is
accelerated, however, this may not be an entirely bad thing. A
crisis would force the reforms crucial to Medicare's long-term
survival.

LEARNING THE GEOMETRY LESSONS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONG BEACH, Calif. _ The triangle met the Pyramid, and where the
two intersected stood 12 young men wearing perplexed expressions,
as if they'd just been told to dissect a Venn diagram.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to geometry, Phil Jackson-style, or day two of the
Lakers' summer-league training camp.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson is installing the mysterious triangle offense as the
Lakers' new system, and the first initiates are a collection of
rookies, semi-veterans and fresh-faced free agents who compose the
Lakers' summer-league team.
</P>
<P>
   The study session at the Long Beach State gym, the Pyramid, has
made for a somewhat humorous scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just amazing to watch their expressions,'' Lakers
assistant coach Larry Drew said Thursday, ``but they're picking it
up.''
</P>
<P>
   There's little time for learning. Summer-league competition
opens today and the Lakers play the Portland Trail Blazers' entry
at 7:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Come October, Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant will get
indoctrinated into the triangle way of life. For now, the students
are second-year Lakers Tyronn Lue and Sam Jacobson, veteran Travis
Knight, rookies Devean George and John Celestand and a half-dozen
free agents in search of NBA contracts.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they're getting right now is exactly what . . . the
`varsity' will get when they report in the fall,'' Lakers assistant
coach Jim Cleamons said. ``Everything's the same. That's why these
guys will have a heads-up on the guys that report in the fall.''
</P>
<P>
   Knight is enjoying the experience. &QL; 
``It's been different,'' he said. ``It's an offense really unlike
anything I've ever run. It's kind of one continuous, flowing
offense. . . . There's no `stop, set this (play) up, run it.' It's
all kind of moving, moving, moving.''
</P>
<P>
   For George, a rookie from Division III Augsberg College, the
transition to the triangle ``is wild.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a lot of memory,'' he said of the motion- and
passing-oriented system. ``His terminology is totally different _
he wants a `pinch-pop-curl,' then this series wants a
`pick-pick-fly.' And we're like, !ital!what? ''
</P>
<P>
   Better order the protractors and compasses.
</P>
<P>
   __ Notes: Cleamons signed a three-year contract Thursday,
becoming the first assistant named to Jackson's staff. A second
assistant could be named as soon as today. . . . Jackson plans to
return home to Montana on Saturday, turning over the summer-league
team to Cleamons. Jackson's schedule is not certain, but he might
not return until September.

DEMAND IS HIGH FOR SUITES AT STILL-UNFINISHED RACETRACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM PEDLEY  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Construction isn't even to the point where Kansas Speedway looks
like a speedway, but plans are already being made for the
facility's expansion.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas Speedway Corp. President Grant Lynch said Thursday that
because of demand for hospitality suites at the track,
consideration is being given to increasing the number of suites
that will be available in phase 1 of construction.
</P>
<P>
   The interest ``is even greater than we anticipated,'' Lynch
said. ``We are overwhelmed by the excitement that folks around the
region have shown.''
</P>
<P>
   Gillian Zucker, director of business development for Kansas
Speedway Corp., said if the plan for expansion is approved by the
board of directors of International Speedway Corp. -- the parent
company of Kansas Speedway Corp. -- it will more than double the
number of suites -- from 32 to 68 -- that will be built for phase
1.
</P>
<P>
   Long-term lease agreements have been secured for all of the
original 32 suites. Speedway developers have received hundreds of
requests for additional suites.
</P>
<P>
   Zucker declined to reveal names of companies that have committed
to purchase suites, but she said the companies offer ``a neat mix.
Some are national, some are regional, some are local. Some are
companies you have never heard of.''
</P>
<P>
   The cost of building the new suites is uncertain, but it would
be added to the project's overall price tag that now stands at $224
million for phase 1. The speedway is being funded by a combination
of revenue bonds, developer equity and state and local incentives.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas Speedway Corp. may also consider increasing the
grandstand capacity for phase 1. The reason, again, is the level of
interest.
</P>
<P>
   More than 15,000 people who have contacted speedway offices in
search of tickets have been placed on a mailing list. Speedway
officials project that each person on the list will buy
approximately four tickets to Winston Cup events.
</P>
<P>
   ``That (the number of people who are on the mailing list) is
totally unsolicited,'' Zucker said. ``That's important. We have
been very cautious about putting our number out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Phase 1 plans currently call for grandstand seating of 75,000.
Phase 2 calls for increasing that to 150,000.
</P>
<P>
   Zucker said that phase 1 plans have been updated to increase the
number of parking spaces from 25,000 to 65,000.
</P>
<P>
   The speedway, now under construction near the intersection of
Interstates 70 and 435, was originally scheduled to open in 2000.
But delays in construction caused by poor weather and since-settled
lawsuits have in all probability pushed that date back to 2001.
</P>
<P>
   A Winston Cup race will be the crown jewel of the 1.5-mile,
tri-oval track's race offering. The Indy Racing League also is
planning to hold a race at the track.
</P>
<P>
   Those wanting to get on the mailing list are asked to do so by
accessing the track's Web site at www.kansasspeedwaycorp.com, or
call (913) 328-3300.

PANEL URGES PLAN TO CURB PROLIFERATION OF WEAPONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The government's efforts to fight the spread of
chemical, biological and nuclear weapons are disorganized and
overlapping, says an independent commission that calls for a new
White House czar to direct a streamlined defense against ``a grave
threat to the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   In a report to be sent to Congress next week, the bipartisan
panel implicitly criticizes President Clinton and recommends that a
national coordinator head a council of senior officials from the
departments of State, Defense, Commerce and Energy and from the CIA
and FBI.
</P>
<P>
   This new organization would coordinate policy making and
budgeting among as many as 96 often-competing federal agencies that
are now involved in preventing or responding to the spread of
biological, chemical and nuclear weapons, and the means to deliver
them.
</P>
<P>
   The report did not address domestic threats like terrorist
attacks, but instead focused on ways to create more effective
responses to matters like detecting foreign germ warfare programs
and reducing the risk of nuclear material being lost or stolen from
the Russian stockpile.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. government is not effectively organized to combat
proliferation,'' the report says. ``With no one specifically in
charge of all proliferation-related efforts, no one is ultimately
accountable to the president and to Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   The panel's recommendations come as North Korea is threatening
to launch another long-range missile, perhaps capable of reaching
the West Coast, and the world's two newest declared nuclear powers,
India and Pakistan, are waging war along their border in Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   In light of a House investigation that concluded that China has
been systematically stealing information about American nuclear
warheads and missiles since the 1970s, many lawmakers want to move
nuclear weapons work from the Energy Department to the Defense
Department to increase security over the nation's atomic secrets.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview, John M. Deutch, a former director of
Central Intelligence who headed the panel, said, ``The government
must reorganize itself if it's going to meet the more dangerous
proliferation threats we now face.''
</P>
<P>
   Congress set up the panel, the Commission to Assess the
Organization of the Federal Government to Combat the Proliferation
of Weapons of Mass Destruction, in October 1996.
</P>
<P>
   An advance copy of the 178-page report was obtained by The New
York Times. The commission's findings were first reported this week
in The Philadelphia Inquirer.
</P>
<P>
   The commission's recommendations touch virtually every federal
agency with a role in combating the proliferation of weapons of
mass destruction, and Deutch predicted that many federal officials
would balk at reorganizing their efforts and perhaps relinquishing
some of their bureaucratic authority.
</P>
<P>
   The White House reacted cautiously Thursday to the report's
findings and recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a serious and thoughtful report that we're going to
study very carefully,'' said a senior administration official who
has read the report.
</P>
<P>
   At the Pentagon, Deputy Defense Secretary John J. Hamre told
reporters that the United States was well prepared to stop the use
of nuclear weapons, but less prepared to combat other threats.
</P>
<P>
   The 12-member panel declared, ``The president must lead
efforts'' to combat the threat and to direct a more cohesive,
effective counterattack.
</P>
<P>
   While the threats from biological, chemical and nuclear weapons
that the panel described are not new, the ominous world backdrop
against which the report is being made public gives new urgency to
the findings, panel members said.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of the continuing economic turmoil in Russia, the
panel reported at least seven instances since 1992 when
weapons-grade fissionable material was stolen from Russian plants
or storage sites. ``Russia has no reliable inventory of its fissile
material,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, countries like Iran, Iraq, North Korea and
Syria either have or are seeking biological, chemical or nuclear
weapons, and China has sold missiles or missile technology to Iran
and Pakistan, it said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a many-headed monster out there,'' said Sen. Arlen
Specter, a R-Penn., who is vice chairman of the panel.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, many federal agencies have been slow to respond to the
threat, the commission said.
</P>
<P>
   The Persian Gulf War, for example, exposed shortcomings in the
military's ability to detect biological or chemical agents. Eight
years and billions of dollars in research later, the commission
said the military had made little progress in developing more
advanced technology.

DICICCO HAS LEARNED ON THE JOB
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 c.1999 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLAREMONT, Calif. _ Tony DiCicco was not the most popular choice
to succeed former U.S. women's soccer coach Anson Dorrance in the
summer of 1994. In fact, the choice seemed destined for disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did DiCicco have no professional, college or head
coaching experience, his four children are boys.
</P>
<P>
   He had served as the U.S. women's assistant since 1991, working
with the goalkeepers during Team USA's inaugural Women's World Cup
championship in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   He was a graduate of Springfield College in Massachusetts and
played five years of professional soccer in the American Soccer
League. But what did he stand to gain by accepting the women's job?
</P>
<P>
   He had to follow Dorrance, not only the coach of Team USA's
Women's World Cup champions but the winningest women's college
coach ever at North Carolina, where he worked with such standouts
as Mia Hamm, Kristine Lilly and Carla Overbeck.
</P>
<P>
   DiCicco, who leads the United States against China in Saturday's
Women's World Cup final at the Rose Bowl, looked at it two ways: He
had nothing to lose. And nothing to gain.
</P>
<P>
   ``One part of me was excited about the challenge,'' said DiCicco
in 1994. ``The other was terrified and knew that even winning would
simply be what was expected.''
</P>
<P>
   He knew there were naysayers, but he simply went about his
business.
</P>
<P>
   ``I reminded them (the critics) that the players had no
experience when they started, either,'' DiCicco said. ``This is
something you have to learn by doing, by getting into the game and
making it happen.''
</P>
<P>
   So he did what any smart, green coach would do. He went to his
star player _ in this case, obviously, Hamm _ and asked for advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said, `Coach us like men but treat us like women,' '' said
DiCicco, whose only coaching failure was losing the 1994 Women's
World Cup to Norway in Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took that to mean, `Be demanding of us on the field and push
us to our best possible level, but treat us with respect and don't
be an in-your-face coach.' And I'll tell you what. I've utilized it
to this day.''
</P>
<P>
   DiCicco has become the most successful coach in the history of
international soccer, winning the 1996 Olympic gold medal, and has
compiled a remarkable 96-8-7 record along the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``The international games force you to grow, and that's one
thing I really admire about Tony,'' assistant coach Lauren Gregg
said. ``Every opportunity he has to get better, he takes advantage
of. He's a student of the game. No one spends more time watching
tapes, analyzing and discussing them, than Tony does. He's learned
how to lead women, how to lead teams and brought an incredible
tactical sophistication on both sides of the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   DiCicco also learned the difference between coaching women and
men.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are very subtle changes, but overall, when you're
speaking to men, you have to speak to them individually,'' DiCicco
said. ``When I speak to the women, I can speak to them collectively
because they internalize everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I say, `Work on your fitness,' the women will know I'm
speaking to the whole group. If I say that to the guys, they just
say, `I'm the only one fit on this damn team.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there's more to coaching women than that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coaching 20 females and trying to keep 20 females happy isn't
always the easiest task,'' striker Cindy Parlow said. ``But he's
unique in that he's willing to listen to the players and willing to
take their opinions on different things. We're never afraid to
voice our opinions to him and he has adopted what we've said to
this team.''
</P>
<P>
   And for a man with four sons, he certainly learned a few things
about females.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he has 20 daughters here,'' midfielder Lorrie Fair
said. ``He's the perfect fit for this team because he's fatherly.
But he's a coach first, which we all respect.''
</P>
<P>
   And who better to receive the credit for constructing Team USA's
wonderful reputation than DiCicco?
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the manager of these 20 players; it starts with him and
ends with him,'' striker Tiffeny Milbrett said. ``I credit him a
lot for learning how to keep his players in check and knowing what
to do. He's had to manage this team and keep winning, and he's done
both for a long time now.''
</P>
<P>
   The bumpy five-year ride has all been worth it for DiCicco.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just feel very fortunate,'' he said. ``I was in the right
place at the right time to even be given this job. It's been a joy
to work with this team over the past five years. We've developed
some great relationships with the team, and it's been an honor to
watch them mature.''
</P>
<P>
   DiCicco isn't looking past Saturday but admits his future is
uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure how long I'll keep going,'' he said. ``I've spent
a lot of time away from my family and I'm just looking forward to
winning Saturday and getting home to my wife and children.''
</P>
<P>
   Gregg, at least, thinks he'll stick around a little longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been such a tough road for him,'' Gregg said. ``People on
the outside have no idea what it takes to succeed at this level and
he's given so much of his time. I know he wants to get back with
his family, but hopefully, he'll stay through the 2000 Olympic
Games in Sydney.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The new Treasury secretary, Lawrence H. Summers, went
to Harlem Thursday to encourage more private investment in poor
neighborhoods and announced the formation of a new mentoring
program to allow inner-city entrepreneurs in New York to draw upon
the expertise of large corporations.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new program, a task force will be set up by the New
York City Partnership and Chamber of Commerce, the city's leading
business group, to match big companies with start-ups or other
small businesses. Ten entrepreneurs will be selected during each of
the next two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is about much much more than money,'' Summers told a
group of business leaders who gathered at Chase Manhattan Bank
Thursday to share some of their previous mentoring experiences with
him. ``It's about advice, it's about networks, it's about the
provision of opportunity, and it's about providing and sharing the
types of knowledge that are necessary. In many ways, the money and
financing are the least of it.''
</P>
<P>
   In his visit to New York, Summers underscored the same themes
that President Clinton sounded this week during a four-day trip to
Hazard, Ky., and other economically distressed areas across the
country. Like the president, Summers said that investing in poor
neighborhoods was not a matter of charity but made good economic
sense. The Clinton administration has proposed a new tax credit to
encourage investments in what are being described as ``new
markets.''
</P>
<P>
   The new Treasury secretary drew praise from David Rockefeller,
who participated in the meeting of business leaders, for coming to
New York less than a week after he was sworn in. Rockefeller said
that the economic development initiatives taking place while the
city's economy is robust represent a fundamental change that would
continue in harsher times ``when the bloom is off the rose.''
</P>
<P>
   During a tour of the construction site of Harlem U.S.A., a
long-delayed shopping center on 125th Street that is scheduled to
open by Christmas, Summers seemed genuinely impressed by the
numbers he was fed. Drew Greenwald, one of the developers, and Mark
Willis, a senior vice president at Chase, told him that the complex
was expected to generate $200 million a year in sales and $17
million in sales taxes, yet had required only $11 million in
government loans. They said that nearby property values had soared
from $30 a square foot to $75 a square foot. About 500 new jobs are
expected to be created.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people are going to make a lot of money here,''
Summers said at the shopping center, whose tenants will include
Disney, HMV and Old Navy. In a later interview, he said that the
financial leaders he met with had stressed that such investments
are no longer relegated to special bank subsidiaries dealing with
community development but are viewed as mainstream investments.
</P>
<P>
   Some Harlem business owners have complained that they have been
driven out by rising rents on 125th Street, but Summers said some
displacement was an inevitable consequence of economic development.
But, he said, ``you'll see more vibrancy spread off 125th Street to
the next streets.''

BOGGS REFUSES TO ACT HIS AGE 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-DEVIL RAYS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ The difference between the third basemen
is two decades and 2,970 hits.
</P>
<P>
   The kid, 21-year-old Red Sox rookie Wilton Veras, will have his
nights. He's shown that already in the week he's been filling in
for John Valentin, who is back home having his head examined.
</P>
<P>
   The old man, 41-year-old Wade Boggs, knows his nights are
numbered, but that doesn't mean he can't still have his moments
before they place his bust in Cooperstown.
</P>
<P>
   One such moment will come when he collects his 3,000th hit,
sometime next month. That will be a career highlight, assuring him
a place among baseball's immortals.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday &UR;  &LR; night's highlight won't be remembered past next week.
But Boggs's diving stop of Veras's bid for a hit with runners on
second and third with two out in the eighth inning helped assure
Tampa Bay of another win over the Red Sox, who were 3-2 losers for
the second night in a row.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was unbelievable, man,'' said Devil Rays pitcher Bobby
Witt, the Canton, Mass., native who outdueled another
south-of-Boston pitcher, Dartmouth's Brian Rose, the Red Sox rookie
saddled with his second straight loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one thing about Wade,'' Witt said, ``he never ceases to
amaze you. I don't know how old he is, but he's still out there,
diving on the turf, the first one running on and off the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy's passion has never been lost. He still plays the way
I saw him when he played for the Red Sox. That's why you have to
enjoy him when you watch his act, to see how he performs.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sox also were hurt by former Red Sox Jose Canseco, whose
31st home run accounted for Tampa Bay's second run. Boston lost its
third straight to the second-year Devil Rays and is four games
behind the Yankees in the American League East. It's the first time
in a month the Sox have lost as many as three games in a row. They
lost five straight from June 5 to June 9.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it is best, in terms of October planning, that the Sox
won't have to see Tampa Bay again this season. The Devil Rays, who
took two straight last week in Fenway Park before taking three of
four here, won the season series, 9-4. It's the first time the
Devil Rays have beaten anyone as many as nine times in a season,
and it's the first time the Sox have lost nine times to one
opponent since 1996, when both the Royals and Indians did it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rose really pitched a good game, and so did (Derek) Lowe,''
manager Jimy Williams said, alluding to the 2 1/3 scoreless innings
turned in by the Sox reliever. ``We turned some double plays (two),
and we hit the ball good. With that in mind, I feel like we're
going to win games if we play like that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sox, who were 1 for 7 with runners in scoring position, are
clearly showing the effects of missing Nomar Garciaparra, who sat
out his sixth straight game since aggravating his strained left
groin, and Valentin, who is eligible to come off the disabled list
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox, who won the opener here, 4-2, managed to score just
a dozen runs in four games against the Devil Rays.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a great player, that kid,'' Witt said of Garciaparra.
``Without him in the lineup, they're obviously a lot different. You
get him out of there, and John Valentin, that's the left side of
their infield. And they're both good clutch hitters.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sox scored a run in the third when Jose Offerman walked,
took third on Reggie Jefferson's double, and scored on Damon
Buford's infield out.
</P>
<P>
   They scored again in the sixth on Buford's one-out walk, a
stolen base, and a single by Troy O'Leary. That was it, as they
left seven men on base in the last four innings, including the
eighth, when Boggs flashed leather at a time of night when he
usually is on the bench for a defensive replacement.
</P>
<P>
   Pinch runner Chad Fonville, who entered the game after pinch
hitter Mike Stanley drew a leadoff walk from reliever Norm
Charlton, sped to third when Jason Varitek grounded a two-out
double down the third-base line past Boggs, who ostensibly was
guarding the line.
</P>
<P>
   Veras, who already had one single, then slapped a ball toward
the shortstop hole. But Boggs, leaving his feet, stabbed the ball,
scrambled to his feet, and threw out the disbelieving Veras.
</P>
<P>
   That left the hit totals:
</P>
<P>
   Boggs, 2,978.
</P>
<P>
   Veras, 8.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson singled with two out in the ninth off Devil Rays
closer Roberto Hernandez, but Hernandez retired Buford on a tapper
to second to put away the Sox for his fifth save in eight
appearances against Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The Devil Rays took a 1-0 lead against Rose in the first when
Miguel Cairo tripled and scored when he beat Daubach's throw home
on Aaron Ledesma's ground ball.
</P>
<P>
   After the Sox tied it in the third, Canseco, who had been 0 for
12 with six strikeouts in the series, lost a hanger from Rose (3
runs, 5 hits in 5 2/3 innings) into the left-field seats for his
31st home run.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a slider right over the middle of the plate,'' Canseco
said. ``Even as bad as I've been slumping, I couldn't have missed
it. I'm glad I didn't foul it off or miss it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the sixth, Canseco walked, took second on an infield out when
Offerman elected to get the out at first instead of the force, and
scored on a single by yet another former Red Sox, catcher John
Flaherty. The throw from right fielder Trot Nixon, for the second
straight night, was just enough off line to allow the run to score.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rose had good stuff,'' said Witt, who walked four and gave up
seven hits in his 6 2/3 innings but held the Sox to two runs. ``We
were fortunate to get a couple of breaks, and Jose hit that ball,
but I think the kid has great stuff. This was the first time I've
seen him live, and I was really impressed.''
</P>
<P>
   But not impressed enough to lose to him.

<P>
   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
IF the message hadn't penetrated, then it is unavoidable even for
the most pig-headed chauvinist: Women's sports are no longer the
distant next wave in this country but are crashing ashore with the
force of a tsunami.
</P>
<P>
   Consider that a crowd of more than 70,000 has filled Giants
Stadium this summer to see the U.S. national team in the Women's
World Cup soccer tournament. They sold out Soldier Field in
Chicago, drew more than 50,000 to Foxboro, Mass., and probably will
exceed the 90,000 barrier for Saturday's final at the Rose Bowl in
Pasadena, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Houston, in the third season of the WNBA, the Comets
draw an average of 11,143 for their home dates, a figure that is
roughly matched throughout the league as the popularity of the
women's game has spread with the speed and heat of a grease fire.
</P>
<P>
   What is significant about the inroads of the late 20th century
is they are not coming only in the so-called ``traditional''
women's sports of tennis, golf, figure skating and gymnastics,
where it is the individual name that has marquee value.
</P>
<P>
   For while Venus and Serena Williams, Juli Inkster, Tara Lipinski
and Kerri Strug are merely the latest in a line of women's sports
stars, what is changing the landscape most is the area of team
sports.
</P>
<P>
   And why not? The number of young girls participating in
basketball and soccer is in the millions nationwide, and it only
makes sense the majority gender eventually would develop its own
idols to emulate or athletes in the hometown or national colors to
cheer.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a capitalist society, this is the tip of the iceberg for
gender equity,'' says Donna Lopiano, director of the Women's Sports
Foundation. ``Corporations finally understand that the men's market
is oversaturated.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were ignoring a prolific market _ women _ who buy
products disproportionate to their own participation. For sponsors,
this is like finding candy in a candy store.''
</P>
<P>
   For many male sports fans, it has been like hitting a secret
button on the remote control and finding a new ballgame.
</P>
<P>
   For others, women's sports have grown in appeal because they are
more fun to watch than a collection of pampered, grumpy,
no-autograph-signing, paternity-suit-fleeing, I-get-no-respect men
going through the motions for $5 million to $10 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   Because they're relatively underpaid and struggling for
attention, the female pros consistently play harder and also
perform with equal flair, fire and emotion.
</P>
<P>
   They carry around less off-the-field baggage than their male
counterparts, and because they are not as physically powerful, they
usually employ better teamwork and technique and seem to have more
fun.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, the NBA, not the WNBA, convened a special committee to
inject more life into its games. Just watch Sheryl Swoopes, Cynthia
Cooper, Tina Thompson and the rest of the Comets push the ball up
and down the floor if you're a basketball fan and have forgotten
what a fast break looks like.
</P>
<P>
   The WNBA women also have taken a quantum leap in the style and
quality of the game. Just from the early '90s, the difference in
women's basketball is similar to the change in the men's game from
the '50s.
</P>
<P>
   There is no Air Jordan, but there is athleticism to which the
next generation of young girls can aspire.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of popularity, there is nothing that has exploded onto
the radar screen this year like the U.S. women's soccer team.
</P>
<P>
   As the pithy slogan goes on Late Night with David Letterman:
Soccer moms; Soccer mamas.
</P>
<P>
   Some of them have kids. Some of them have posed provocatively
for magazines.
</P>
<P>
   Mia Hamm, the prolific goal scorer, was not only named one of
the 50 Most Beautiful by People magazine but also gained the
ultimate tribute in marketing and sports iconism by co-starring
with Michael Jordan in the ``Anything you can do, I can do better''
TV spot.
</P>
<P>
   Together they have shown it is possible to become the most
formidable team on the planet, playing an aggressive, attacking,
relentless brand of soccer, while at the same time remaining down
to earth and accessible to the thousands in the stadiums and the
millions of others watching their march to the World Cup title and
wave-ride of acceptance into the sports mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   For half the population, surf's up, finally, for the new
millennium.

HARDLY ANY HAM IN HAMM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLAREMONT, Calif. _ Somebody on Thursday showed Mia Hamm the
1999 Women's World Cup All-Star selections. The U.S. striker
scanned the 16-player list. She saw U.S. goalkeeper Briana Scurry's
name and Brazilian midfielder Sissi's and Chinese striker Sun
Wen's.
</P>
<P>
   ``The players there definitely deserve to be on it,'' Hamm said.
</P>
<P>
   Then her eyes locked on the last name on the list. Pointing to
it, she said, smirking, ``Oh, I don't know about that one.''
</P>
<P>
   The name she was fingering was her own.
</P>
<P>
   Hamm's gesture drew guffaws from the news gatherers in her
midst.
</P>
<P>
   Pedro Martinez renouncing his All-Star berth after failing to
beat Tampa Bay despite fanning 14 would be worth a headline. Ditto
cyclist Lance Armstrong turning down the yellow shirt in the Tour
de France or Shaquille O'Neal repudiating any 50 Greatest Players
list with his name on it.
</P>
<P>
   Hamm's humility, however, didn't raise an eyebrow, much less a
pen. She has a reputation, well-earned, for being as modest as a
nun's habit. So people naturally read nothing into her
self-deprecating remark.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, in this instance Hamm wasn't being humble, just honest.
</P>
<P>
   She might carry the torch as the world's best female soccer
player, but Tiffeny Milbrett has been the one carrying the U.S.
team during the past three weeks. Milbrett, 26, is tied for fourth
in World Cup scoring, with three goals on four shots in five games.
Hamm, 27, is tied for 13th with two goals, both of them
game-winners (she also has two assists).
</P>
<P>
   The real strength of the U.S. squad has turned out to be its
depth, not its demure diva. Every starter but two has scored and
six players have at least two goals.
</P>
<P>
   Its balance is reminiscent of France's World Cup-winning men's
team of a year ago, when Zinedine Zidane and his fellow hosts
blasted Brazil 3-0 in the final.
</P>
<P>
   Hamm is less like Zidane than Brazil's Ronaldo. Right down to
her sponsor's swoosh. Ronaldo, you might remember, was roundly
ripped for failing to live up to his pre-World Cup press clippings.
</P>
<P>
   ``A pallid performance'' is how one scribe summarized Ronaldo's
turn on the world stage. This review he earned by scoring ``only''
four goals in six games leading up to the final, which France won
3-0.
</P>
<P>
   Hamm, the game's all-time leading goal scorer, isn't under siege
by the press. She has been hemmed in by reporters but by no means
hammered.
</P>
<P>
   In a scene U.S. co-captain Carla Overbeck termed ``hilarious,''
scribes scampered the length of the soggy field, elbowing one
another for position around Hamm, as soon as the U.S. team finished
practice Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Hamm diligently answered questions while sitting in a folding
chair. Sometimes she made eye contact with her inquisitor but more
often she looked down and picked at the cellophane ice bag wrapped
around her tender left hamstring while giving measured responses.
</P>
<P>
   There were kids by the minivan full at the practice and more
than a few of them infiltrated the interview session afterward,
armed with indelible markers. One turned to another halfway through
Hamm's Q and A with the media and whispered, ``She's really shy.''
</P>
<P>
   The little girl got that right. If there's one thing Hamm skirts
more deftly than defenders, it's the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   A national news magazine recently wanted to run a shot of Hamm
on its cover. She pleaded with her interrogators not to do that and
they ended up running a head shot of presidential hopeful George W.
Bush instead.
</P>
<P>
   When the U.S. team bus pulled up to Pomona-Pitzer college,
hundreds of people were there with signs and smiles to greet them.
Hamm disembarked on the heels of the team's tallest player, Cindy
Parlow, and followed her up the path as though she were hoping to
hide behind Parlow's 5-foot-11-inch frame.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the U.S. practice got under way in earnest, a couple
thousand people were framing the field. Mia wannabes on this day
looked to be much more outgoing than the original, mugging for the
television cameras and breaking out into chants of ``Mee-ahh'' at
the drop of a hint from a microphone-wielding reporter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just try to keep all the attention in a humorous light,''
Hamm said. ``The most important thing is to not let it change you
as a person.''
</P>
<P>
   In her teammates' eyes, Hamm is a star in street clothes, too.
</P>
<P>
   Said Overbeck, ``Mia is as good or better of a person than she
is a soccer player.''
</P>
<P>
   If it annoys Hamm that people who didn't know a free kick from a
penalty kick three weeks ago are picking apart her World Cup
performance, she doesn't show it.
</P>
<P>
   ``One person can't carry a team. I never thought I could,'' Hamm
said. ``If people want to (define) success as whether you're
scoring or not, that's their prerogative. What I focus on is, do I
have an impact on this team?''
</P>
<P>
   Well, she made two great passes that led to goals in the second
game against Nigeria, drew a penalty kick in the second half of the
U.S.s semifinal against Brazil that Michelle Akers converted. And
then there are her two goals.
</P>
<P>
   You hear people critically dissect Hamm's performance and you're
reminded of another unselfish scorer whose Hall of Fame bust seemed
to be sprouting cracks under the white-hot spotlight. During the
1993 Stanley Cup playoffs, the so-called experts excoriated Wayne
Gretzky.
</P>
<P>
   So who scored the overtime winner in Game 7 against Toronto to
send the Kings into the Finals against Montreal? Gretzky, of
course.
</P>
<P>
   It wouldn't shock us if Hamm has a similar answer for her
critics on Saturday against China. As teammate Tisha Venturini
observed, ``Good things always happen to her in big games.''
</P>
<P>
   That would explain why she's the best. &QL;

   LONDON _ Sales records were broken one after another for Old
Master paintings, medieval manuscripts and antiques of every
variety here at Christie's on Thursday as more than
three-and-a-half hours of feverish bidding erupted over a trove of
treasures looted by the Nazis and returned to the Rothschild family
this year by the Austrian government.
</P>
<P>
   Prized Frans Hals portraits, an illuminated medieval prayer book
and a Louis XVI royal commode were among the highlights that
attracted record-shattering bids for the more than 200 lots,
holdings from the Austrian branch of the great banking family.
</P>
<P>
   The sale jammed Christie's Great Hall to overflow, with many
members of other branches of the Rothschild family present and
bidding, officials at the auction house said. Virtually every item
sold, most for more than their estimated prices.
</P>
<P>
   Expected to bring in $40 million, the sale totaled $89.9 million
as it reached its exhausting ending.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Christie's said 10 records were set: five for
Old Master paintings and one each for an illuminated manuscript
sold at auction, an Italian manuscript sold at auction, a piece of
furniture sold at auction, a clock sold at auction and a carpet
sold at auction.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of the most successful sales in the history of
auctions in Europe,'' said Lord Hindlip, chairman of Christie's.
``Never before has such a cross-section of the arts fetched such
extraordinary sums of money in one evening.''
</P>
<P>
   Attracting the attention were the glittering contents of the
family palaces originally belonging to the brothers Albert and
Nathaniel von Rothschild in southwest Austria. They had acquired a
staggering variety of holdings from the declining monarchs and
aristocrats of 19th-century Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The brothers were connoisseurs and passionate collectors who
personified the opulence of fin-de-siecle Vienna. But the family's
holdings were seized by the Nazis during the German Anschluss in
1938. When surviving members tried to retrieve their possessions
after the war, the Austrian government allowed them to leave the
country with only a portion of what they owned, citing an export
law, similar to those in other European countries, that forbade the
movement of many treasured works out of the country. Many of them
were hung in Vienna's great museums. The Rothschilds and other
families said they agreed to leave their works only under duress.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing her intention to return the possessions, Austrian
Culture Minister Elisabeth Gehrer said last year that she wanted to
rectify what she termed immoral decisions at the end of the war.
</P>
<P>
   She ran into criticism from some Austrians who viewed the
post-war agreements as legitimate and also argued that the valuable
art works belonged not in a private collection but in public view.
</P>
<P>
   Saying their holdings had been vastly reduced over the years, in
part because of wartime destruction by the Nazis, family members
decided to auction the holdings after they were removed from the
museums and released to them this year.
</P>
<P>
   Present Thursday was the Baroness Bettina de Rothschild, the
matriarch of the Austrian branch, who watched the sale on a
closed-circuit television monitor from a private office at
Christie's. The baroness, along with her two children, a niece and
a nephew were the sellers. They watched as one by one, Old Master
paintings, French furniture, clocks, textiles, scientific
instruments, Islamic glass and illuminated manuscripts were sold
for multiples of their estimates.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear Thursday how many of them would wind up in the
hands of museums and on public view. Most of them ended up going to
an international group of collectors.
</P>
<P>
   One museum that did buy one of the evening's most expensive
objects was Versailles. It bought a commode made by Jean-Henri
Riesener, the finest cabinetmaker to work for Louis XVI; it was
delivered to him for Fontainebleau in October 1778 and in 1787 sent
to Versailles. The French museum paid $10.9 million, 2.5 times the
high estimate, $4.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Christie's said other museums had made purchases as
well, but none were ready to announce them.

</P>
<P>
   One visible bidder was Sheik Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani, the
emir of Qatar, who bought two mosque lamps and two carpets for
roughly $6.6 million. Most of the bidding was done either on the
telephone or through dealers.
</P>
<P>
   The highest priced work in the sale was a prayer book, a
medieval illuminated manuscript containing 67 full-page miniatures.
Five people tried to buy the work, which was estimated to sell for
$3.3 million to $4.9 million. It sold to an unidentified telephone
bidder for $13.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   The same bidder bought another manuscript, the Cornaro Missal,
an illuminated manuscript, circa 1503, that was expected to bring
$250,000 to $330,000. It sold for $4.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Old Master paintings also fetched record prices.
Among the finest was Frans Hals' portrait of Amsterdam merchant
Tieleman Roosterman. The three-quarter-length portrait shows him
posed in black with a white ruffled color and cuffs. In the upper
right corner of the painting is the Roosterman coat of arms.
Estimated to sell for $4.1 million to $5.7 million, it was bought
by Clovis Whitfield, a London dealer for $12.8 million, making it
the second highest priced work in the sale.
</P>
<P>
   The previous record for a Hals was set on July 3, 1997, at
Sotheby's in London when ``St. John the Evangelist'' sold for $2.9
million.
</P>
<P>
   Three Hals paintings were sold Thursday night. One of the
others, a ``Portrait of a Gentleman,'' in a black coat and cape
with a black hat and gloves in his left hand, carried an estimate
of $2 million to $2.9 million; it was bought by an unidentified
telephone bidder for $3.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Cooney, a private dealer in New York, bought ``Portrait
of a Lady,'' also dressed in black, which had an estimate of $1.3
million to $2 million, for $1.4 million. Cooney also bought
Tenier's portrait of the Archduke Leopold Wilhelm in his picture
gallery for $4.6 million, nearly three times its high estimate of
$1.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   An evening landscape by Wynants, estimated to sell for $330,000
to $490,000, sold to an unidentified telephone bidder for $3.6
million.
</P>
<P>
   Final prices include the auction house's commission, 15 percent
of the first $50,000 and 10 percent of the rest. Estimates do not
reflect commissions.
</P>
<P>
   Of the many works that sold for far more than their estimates
were a Louis XVI ormolu-mounted long-case clock made for the Duc de
Choiseul, which was expected to bring $820,000 to $1.3 million. It
sold to an unidentified telephone bidder for $3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Sheik al-Thani bought a 16th-century Tabriz medallion carpet for
$2.4 million, way above its $410,000 high estimate. A 10{-inch
Louis XV microscope, estimated to sell for $130,000 to $200,000,
was snapped up on the telephone for $1.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving the sale, Peter Looram, the son of the baroness, said he
was speechless at the results. ``I had no idea it would do this
well,'' he said. ``Who wouldn't be shocked?''

   LOS ANGELES: information to the DMV.
</P>
<P>
   The other 13 players are charged with one misdemeanor count each
of illegally possessing a handicapped placard and giving false
information to the DMV.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Clinton, the accused athletes are Azziz, 22, of Sherman
Oaks; Thomas, 18, of Imperial; Damian Dominic Allen, 21, of Van
Nuys; Marques Deon Anderson, 20, of Long Beach; Oscar Cabrera, 21,
of Highland Park; James Michael Ghezzi, 22, of Mar Vista; Duval
Jerome Hicks, 23, of Sherman Oaks; Ryan Clint Nece, 20, of Palms;
Durell Rayton Price, 21, of Newhall; Mark Reynosa, 20, of Sylmar;
Ryan Jason Roques, 21, of Mar Vista; Craig Hilary Walendy, 21, of
Westlake; and Anthony Dewayne White, 20, of Sherman Oaks.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was a nonscholarship player in 1996, and Allen did not
play last year, Rourke said. Hicks, Reynosa and Walendy played last
year when they were seniors.
</P>
<P>
   When the season starts, Anderson, Roques, Price, Nece, Ghezzi,
Azziz, White and Thomas are candidates to start, and the rest would
be reserves.
</P>
<P>
   The players are scheduled to be arraigned July 28 in Los Angeles
Municipal Court.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA police detectives investigated the case and turned their
findings over to the city attorney's Special Enforcement Unit.

UCLA FOOTBALL PLAYERS CHARGED WITH OBTAINING HANDICAPPED PLACARDS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY PHILLIP W. BROWNE   AND JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Tripped up by a sharp-eyed police officer, 14
current and former UCLA football players were criminally charged
Thursday with falsely claiming physical disabilities to get
handicapped parking placards.
</P>
<P>
   The players used the placards to park in handicapped-only spots
on and off campus and to avoid paying the $225 per-semester parking
fees, according to Deputy City Attorney Brian Williams.
</P>
<P>
   The scheme began to unravel when a school police officer noticed
a placard was misplaced on a car and questioned the driver, leading
him to football players, according to prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   The players, including five from the San Fernando Valley area,
face up to six months in jail and $1,000 fines each if convicted of
the misdemeanor charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am embarrassed and disappointed for the young men who were
involved in this problem,'' head football coach Bob Toledo said in
the statement released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have spoken to the team as a whole and to the individuals
involved, and those individuals will be disciplined by me. This is
not how I expect players in my program to act _ that has been made
very clear to these young men.''
</P>
<P>
   With the season set to begin Sept. 4, the charges rocked team
members, who held an informal practice Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Toledo was very, very angry,'' said one player who asked not
to be identified. ``The penalties are going to be severe. He talked
about how bad we would feel if we knew people who were
handicapped.''
</P>
<P>
   Athletic Director Peter Dalis said the Athletics Department has
cooperated fully with the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly do not condone the actions of the individuals
involved,'' Dalis said in a statement. ``No one in the Athletic
Department was aware of the situation until it was brought to our
attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for the handicapped said the misuse of placards is
outrageous.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very frustrating when you're driving around and all the
handicapped spots are taken,'' said Rose Farzaneh, director of
Farzaneh Social Services. ``If you sit and watch, many people come
back to their cars and they are not disabled after all. We don't
like this kind of thing.''
</P>
<P>
   UCLA sports spokesman Steve Rourke said team members have known
for a few weeks that they might be charged.
</P>
<P>
   ``But right now they are only accused. Let's not convict them
yet,'' Rourke said.
</P>
<P>
   The National Collegiate Athletic Association does not have
jurisdiction over athletes involved in criminal charges. Rather,
the organization leaves penalties up to the schools.
</P>
<P>
   Department of Motor Vehicles officials said UCLA has been the
source of frequent complaints about handicapped parking violations
and the target for undercover investigations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've done stings at UCLA before. A lot of complaints come
from there,'' said Evan Nossoff, a DMV spokesman. ``Illegally
taking a handicapped space is right up there with stealing a blind
man's cane.''
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, the DMV ran a sting at a Beverly Hills restaurant
where valets were stealing placards and either selling them or
using them for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``They got a lot of heat for that,'' Nossoff said. ``Almost
everyone wants preferential parking in Los Angeles.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said the UCLA scheme involved players listing false
ailments and disabilities on applications for the placards. They
also are accused of signing the names of physicians who do not
exist and then submitting the applications to the DMV, Williams
alleged.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation, initiated by UCLA police, began Jan. 16 when
a patrolman spotted a car in the Sunset Village parking structure
on De Neve Drive with a placard improperly placed on the rear-view
mirror.
</P>
<P>
   The officer questioned the driver, who said he was visiting
Robert Wayne Thomas and had borrowed the placard from him, said
City Attorney spokesman Mike Qualls.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA detectives questioned Thomas, then teammate Abdul Azziz,
and got copies of their DMV applications for the placards.
</P>
<P>
   Those applications reportedly contained false information about
physical handicaps, the signature of a nonexistent doctor, a fake
medical license number and an address at the Los Angeles Medical
Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that point, suspicion grew that other players might have
done the same thing,'' Qualls said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators then used DMV records to eventually match the
names of 12 other team members with current or recently expired
handicapped placards, Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the players, 21-year-old Deatra Clinton of West Covina,
obtained two placards and faces two misdemeanor counts of illegally
obtaining a placard and giving false information to the DMV.

GEPHARDT TO WITHDRAW APPOINTMENT OF MUSLIM TO TERRORISM PANEL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS 9th graf to correct ID for Gen. Wayne Downing to `Gen. Wayne
Downing, retired, who directed the investigation of ....')  (mk)

<P>
   After protests from Jewish organizations, the House minority
leader, Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., decided late Thursday to withdraw his
appointment of an American Muslim leader to a congressional
counterterrorism commission, an aide said.
</P>
<P>
   Salam Al-Marayati, executive director of the Muslim Public
Affairs Council in Los Angeles, had been named by Gephardt in June
to serve on the National Commission on Terrorism, a 10-member group
charged with reviewing national policy on preventing and punishing
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after his appointment, Al-Marayati was denounced by Jewish
organizations that accused him of condoning terrorism against
Israel. But other political and religious leaders, many of them
Jewish, who have worked with Al-Marayati had begun speaking in his
defense, praising him as a responsible moderate, and many American
Muslims had contacted Gephardt to signal their support.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt's aide, Susan Harvey, said Al-Marayati had been told
late Thursday that the appointment was in jeopardy, but not because
of political pressure. Instead, Al-Marayati was told that the
process of gaining a security clearance would take longer than the
six-month life of the counterterrorism commission itself.
</P>
<P>
   But Al-Marayati said Thursday: ``I am not withdrawing. I think
that if there is a political will, there is a way to expedite these
security clearances and get down to the business of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Al-Marayati, who is 38, says he has lived in the United States
since his family fled political persecution in Iraq when he was 4
years old. As executive director of the Muslim Public Affairs
Council, Al-Marayati has visited the White House several times for
Muslim holidays and twice to witness the signing of Middle East
peace agreements.
</P>
<P>
   He has served on the Los Angeles Human Relations Commission for
more than a year after being nominated by Mayor Richard Riordan.
The leader of the commission calls Al-Marayati ``a very fair, very
moderate individual.'' Al-Marayati's wife, Dr. Laila Al-Marayati,
was appointed by the White House to the U.S. Commission on
International Religious Freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Informed Thursday night of Gephardt's decision to withdraw
Marayati's appointment, Nihad Awad, executive director of the
Council on American-Islamic Relations, said, ``I think it's a
cowardly decision, because the absence of a credible Muslim voice
will further institutionalize discrimination against Muslims and
Arabs around the issue of terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
   The nine other members of the commission include L. Paul Bremer,
former U.S. ambassador at large for counterterrorism; R. James
Woolsey Jr., former director of central intelligence, and Gen.
Wayne Downing, retired, who directed the investigation of the 1996
bombing that killed 19 American airmen in Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   Six commission members were chosen by majority leaders in the
House and Senate, and four were chosen by the minority leaders.
</P>
<P>
   But Gephardt's choice of Al-Marayati immediately came under
attack by groups like the Conference of Presidents of Major
American Jewish Organizations, which represents 55 groups, the
Anti-Defamation League and the American Jewish Congress.
</P>
<P>
   They pointed to statements made by Marayati, his organization,
his magazine and his co-workers that were critical of Israel and
appeared to blame the Israeli government for provoking Palestinian
anger and violence.
</P>
<P>
   Among the quotes cited by the Jewish groups was this from a
March 1997 press release from the Muslim Public Affairs Council:
``Because the Palestinian people have no avenues to redress their
grievances, some of them have been pushed beyond the margins of
society and have adopted violent reactions to express their despair
and suffering.''
</P>
<P>
   In letters to Gephardt, the Jewish groups accused Al-Marayati of
failing to denounce the militant groups Hamas and Hezbollah, of
supporting Saddam Hussein and of failing to support the peace
agreements with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Seven members of Congress sent a letter to FBI Director Louis
Freeh last week requesting his ``personal involvement'' in
conducting the background check on Al-Marayati.
</P>
<P>
   And Morton Klein, national president of the Zionist Organization
of America, said: ``Salam Al-Marayati has justified Arab terrorism
against Israel. He's justified future terrorism against America.
He's compared America's behavior to Saddam Hussein's behavior. He's
compared Islamic terrorists to the American soldiers of the
American Revolution.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Klein's group has also called for Laila Al-Marayati to be
removed from her post on the U.S. Commission on International
Religious Freedom.
</P>
<P>
   But Al-Marayati has many supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know Salam, I think very well, for five or seven years,''
said Joe Hicks, executive director of the Human Relations
Commission in Los Angeles. ``He's a very fair, very moderate
individual who in my perception is respected in a number of
communities, including the Jewish community here in Los Angeles. He
is not given to wild, extremist views about the Middle East or
Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the Jewish leaders in Los Angeles who have publicly
supported Al-Marayati are Rabbi Alfred Wolf of the American Jewish
Committee's Skirball Institute on American Values and Gene
Lichtenstein, editor of The Jewish Journal.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Al-Marayati said he had a clear record of
opposing terrorism, ``not for the sake of political expediency, but
because of an Islamic stand.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When Hamas and Hezbollah commit acts of terrorism, we condemn
those acts as events contrary to the principles of Islam,'' he
said. ``When those groups build hospitals and develop social
service agencies for the disenfranchised, that's something that we
do not condemn.''
</P>
<P>
   Al-Marayti said that this was the reason he had never issued a
blanket condemnation of Hamas and Hezbollah. And he scoffed at the
idea that he had ever supported Hussein, noting that his family had
been forced to leave Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   John Esposito, a professor of religion and international affairs
at Georgetown University and director of the Center for
Muslim-Christian Understanding at Georgetown, said the whole affair
was ``anti-Arab and anti-Muslim bashing, to put it bluntly.''
</P>
<P>
   Esposito said that asking American Muslims to pass a litmus test
by issuing blanket denunciations of Hamas or Hezbollah is like
asking South Africans to denounce the African National Congress.
All are groups that have multiple wings, some political opposition,
some terrorist, Esposito said.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Marayati would have contributed a crucial perspective to the
commission on terrorism, Esposito said, by representing moderate
American Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're talking mainstream,'' he said. ``If these people are
not acceptable, who is?''

   LOS ANGELES: dates back three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Between July 1996 and July 1997, the district purchased at
least 694 portable classrooms at a cost of about $36 million using
other available contracts,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, the questionable business practices had
not gone unnoticed.
</P>
<P>
   The district's Purchasing Branch repeatedly informed facilities
officials that the purchasing procedures were ``contrary to
policy,'' ``not good business practice'' and ``could be illegal,''
the report states.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1998, the district controller directed staff in the
Facilities Services Division to stop the questionable practices.
Nevertheless, the division continued its practices, the report
continues.
</P>
<P>
   Mullinax's report included three examples in which the flawed
procedures were used despite warnings from supervisors. Most
notably, officials purchased or rented 102 bungalows between
January 1998 and August 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In July 1998, Koch told Louargand that ``installing buildings
and equipment without a purchase contract would be considered poor
business practices in any environment,'' the report notes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even after these directives, on August 6, 1998, the Purchasing
Branch received a requisition for five portable classrooms from the
Facilities Services Division. The portable classrooms had already
been delivered and installed at a school,'' the report states.
</P>
<P>
   Board member David Tokofsky _ the only board member who would
comment on the matter _ said he was not convinced Louargand acted
alone and should be held responsible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beth Louargand would not have done anything without the
approval of her supervisors and a majority of the Board of
Education,'' Tokofsky said. Koch is Louargand's supervisor.
</P>
<P>
   In a July 8 letter to Mullinax, Howard Friedman, senior
assistant general counsel for the district, wrote that the
contention that the competitive bidding process was not followed
``is somewhat misleading.''
</P>
<P>
   Friedman defended the practice, arguing that Facilities Services
Division officials intended to obtain the bungalows ``through
`piggyback' contracts which allow school districts to obtain goods
through lawful, usually competitively bid, contracts of public
entities.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The deficiencies noted in the report,'' he wrote, ``appear to
be more in the sequencing rather than the ultimate compliance with
competitive bidding.''

PORTABLE PURCHASES VILATED STATE LAW, PROBE DISCOVERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY GREG GITTRICH  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Breaking state law and disregarding warnings from
supervisors, Los Angeles Unified School District officials bought
more than $36 million in portable classrooms without competitive
bidding, a report by the district's top investigator charged
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   District officials refused to release the names of the staff
members in the Facilities Services Division involved in the alleged
misdeeds but said no one had been fired.
</P>
<P>
   The four-page report notes state laws governing competitive
bidding are intended to ``eliminate favoritism, fraud and
corruption'' in awarding contracts. The lax procedures employed to
purchase the portable classrooms between July 1996 and August 1998
offered little assurance the district got the best price and put it
``at increased financial and legal risk,'' the report states.
</P>
<P>
   The report, however, fails to detail whether any favoritism,
fraud or corruption occurred or how much, if anything, the district
overpaid for the bungalows. It addresses only the procedures used
to buy the portables, noting they already were installed before
purchase orders were even put through.
</P>
<P>
   Don Mullinax, the district's director of internal audits and
special investigations, could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   While Mullinax does not name any officials in his report, he
repeatedly refers to the general manager of the Facilities Services
Division.
</P>
<P>
   Beth Louargand held that post until last month, when she was
demoted by Superintendent Ruben Zacarias. Despite the demotion,
Zacarias ``starred'' Louargand's salary, allowing her to continue
to take home the same pay. Financial documents list her salary at
$144,242 a year.
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, district officials ``ordered, received
and installed portable classrooms without using the competitive
bidding process and without properly completing purchasing
documents. . . . Known vendors were provided with letters of intent
and purchasing documents were generally prepared after the
classrooms were installed.''
</P>
<P>
   The general manager of the Facilities Services Division told the
audit team the questionable procedures were followed because there
was an urgency to acquire the portable units ``in sufficient
quantity and time'' to meet the need for class-size reduction, the
report states.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although these purchases may have been urgent, the School
District did not declare, and receive approval of an emergency
exemption to the Public Contract Code,'' Mullinax wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Louargand could not be reached for comment. She had responded to
Mullinax's charges in a June 30 message to her boss, David Koch,
the district's chief administrative officer.
</P>
<P>
   Louargand forwarded to Koch a letter written by Alvin Bowen,
director of the portable housing unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can honestly state that to my recollection under no
circumstance when a letter of intent had been issued, did we
receive or install any portable buildings prior to the issuance of
a purchase order,'' Bowen wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The report also seriously misrepresented warnings from
supervisors about the purchasing procedures, Bowen wrote. At the
end of the correspondence, Bowen detailed a list of incidents that
created a need to purchase the portable classrooms in an expedited
manner.
</P>
<P>
   Bowen could not be reached for comment. According to internal
office correspondence obtained by the Daily News, confirmed by two
district sources, Bowen is awaiting reassignment.
</P>
<P>
   Brad Sales, a spokesman for the superintendent, referred all
inquiries to Koch, the chief administrative officer.
</P>
<P>
   Koch released a prepared statement:
</P>
<P>
   ``While it appears the District staff were well-intentioned in
seeking to expedite the delivery and installation of portable
classrooms to provide facilities for class size reduction efforts,
the audit underscores how staff did not follow the normal
acquisition process.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynn Roberts replaced Louargand as the general manager of the
Facilities Services Division on July 1, with approval from the
school board.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts has instructed her staff that standard purchasing
procedures must be followed in ``all procurements and specifically
that a purchase order must be issued before delivery of any good or
services, including portable classrooms,'' Koch noted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Further, Ms. Roberts has restructured the branches within her
Division, resulting in greater supervision, accountability and
coordination.''
</P>
<P>
   Mullinax specified the practice of avoiding competitive bidding
dates back three years.
</P>

SOLA SIERRA, CHILEAN CRUSADER FOR HUMAN RIGHTS, DIES AT 63 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Chile)  (js) 
 By NICK RAVO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sola Sierra, who campaigned to bring to justice those
responsible for the death of her husband and hundreds of other
Chilean dissidents during the dictatorship of Gen. Augusto
Pinochet, died on July 1 at a hospital in Santiago, Chile, where
she lived. She was 63.
</P>
<P>
   She died of a heart attack during surgery for a back injury
suffered in a fall several months ago, according to Jim Foster, a
spokesman with the U. S. Embassy in Santiago.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Sierra spent 23 years doing human rights work in Chile
after her husband disappeared in 1976. Carlos Salinas, a spokesman
for Amnesty International in Washington, said, ``Anyone who was
involved in human rights work at that time in Chile, especially
taking the lead, was courageous.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1984 she became president of the Association of Relatives of
the Detained-Disappeared, an organization that seeks an accounting
of those who vanished under Pinochet and prosecution of those
involved in their deaths.
</P>
<P>
   In the past year, she led protests in London in support of
Pinochet's house arrest there on a Spanish extradition warrant. An
extradition hearing is scheduled for Sept. 27. The general, now 83,
is charged with ordering torture and other crimes during his years
in power, from 1973 to 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing, the most crucial thing, was her
perseverance, her unwavering dedication to this cause,'' said
Apolonia Ramirez Caballero, who from 1976 to 1981 was one of the
coordinators of the Association of Relatives of the
Detained-Disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Sierra was born on Dec. 1, 1935, in Santiago and grew up in
poverty, leaving school in her teens to help support her family.
She worked for several years as a community worker for the Ministry
of Social Development and Planning. She married Waldo Pizarro in
1962 and settled into a life as a working-class wife and, later,
mother of three children.
</P>
<P>
   In 1973, in a right-wing coup backed by the American government,
Pinochet overthrew the government of Salvador Allende Gossens, a
democratically elected Marxist. And on Dec. 15, 1976, Pizarro, a
Communist and labor activist, disappeared. It is presumed that he
was taken prisoner and killed by agents from the DINA, a secret
police run by the Chilean armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,100 Chileans who disappeared under Pinochet are
still unaccounted for.
</P>
<P>
   Two days after Pizarro vanished, Mrs. Sierra and her children
moved in with a sister, Adrina Sierra, whose support allowed Mrs.
Sierra the time to search for her husband and work with the
Association for the Relatives of the Detained-Disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to her sister, Mrs. Sierra is survived by her son,
Waldo Pizarro Jr. of Santiago; two daughters, Lenia Pizarro and
Lorena Pizarro, both of Santiago, and eight other brothers and
sisters.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Sierra was often seen at human rights demonstrations in
Chile, a black-and-white photograph of Pizarro hanging around her
neck.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, the group she led discovered about 180 bodies of
Pinochet prisoners, but no one has been convicted in connection
with the deaths and disappearances. Since 1978, an amnesty has
given members of the DINA and military leaders immunity from
prosecution .
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Sierra was uncompromising in seeking not only the fate and
bodies of the disappeared but also the revocation of the amnesty.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Sierra was both a sympathetic and controversial figure in
Chile, where many would prefer to forget about the dark side of
Pinochet's rule. Prominent foreign visitors, however, eagerly met
with her. The rock star Sting wrote a song about her organization
called ``They Dance Alone.''
</P>
<P>
   The current democratic government in Chile issued a statement
mourning Ms. Sierra's death.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary-General Carlos Mladinic, who represented the
government at her funeral, said he understood the pain she must
have felt. ``Unfortunately, people continue dying in Chile without
knowing the truth,'' Mladinic said. `I hope that in the near future
this pain will end.''

SHAFIK AL-WAZZAN, 74, LEADER OF LEBANON IN TUMULTUOUS '80S 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Lebanon)  (js) 
 By ERIC PACE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Shafik al-Wazzan, prime minister of Lebanon during the
tumultuous 1980s, died Thursday at his home in Beirut. He was 74.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a heart attack, Beirut radio reported.
</P>
<P>
   Wazzan was a lawyer, a moderate Sunni Muslim and a former
minister of justice when he became a compromise choice for prime
minister in 1980, while the country was racked by a civil war that
had begun in 1975 among Muslims, Christians and Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   He was plagued, as prime minister, by Lebanon's
strife-embittered politics, but he managed to form two cabinets
before being forced to step down in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   During those years, the civil war continued, and in 1982 his
country was shaken further by an Israeli invasion and by the
massacre of almost 900 civilians in two Palestinian refugee camps
by Christian Phalangist forces.
</P>
<P>
   In 1983, as Thomas L. Friedman, now a columnist for The New York
Times, wrote in his book ``From Beirut to Jerusalem'' (Farrar
Straus Giroux, 1989), that the United States brokered a peace
treaty between the Lebanese government, led by President Amin
Gemayel, and Israel, which was ``a lopsided _ if impracticable _
agreement favoring Israel that deepened Lebanese Muslim
resentment.''
</P>
<P>
   Wazzan warned that the resentment was rising, and in May 1983,
when the pact was agreed upon, he is said to have told Secretary of
State George P. Shultz: ``This is not an honorable agreement. I
don't believe America has done its best'' in curbing Israel's
demands.
</P>
<P>
   The accord was not put into effect. In October 1983 a truck
filled with explosives killed 241 American servicemen in their
barracks in Beirut. Friedman wrote that Washington's ``not
curtailing Israel's demands for a peace treaty with Beirut'' had
helped fuel the violence.
</P>
<P>
   Wazzan was born in Beirut and received his law degree from St.
Joseph's University there.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Wajiha; a son, Wassim, and a
daughter, Sawsan. &QL;

RONNY GRAHAM, 79, ACTOR AND MEL BROOKS' WRITING COLLABORATOR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (js) 
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ronny Graham, an actor and writer who worked in theater and
films and who was known for his frenetic pacing and ear-to-ear
leer, died on Sunday at Century City Hospital in Los Angeles. He
was 79 and lived in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was complications from liver disease, his son Ronald
Stringer said.
</P>
<P>
   Graham was a longtime associate of the writer and director Mel
Brooks, whom he met while performing in Leonard Sillman's Broadway
musical-comedy revue ``New Faces of 1952,'' for which they both
wrote sketches.
</P>
<P>
   The show, which earned Graham a Tony Award, was adapted for the
screen with much of its stellar cast in tow, among them Robert
Clary, Paul Lynde, Alice Ghostley, Eartha Kitt and June Carroll.
Graham later collaborated on several of Brooks' films, including
``The Inquisition'' and ``History of the World, Part I,'' as well
as ``Spaceballs'' and ``To Be or Not to Be.''
</P>
<P>
   Born Ronald Montcrief Stringer in Philadelphia, Graham learned
his craft by accompanying his parents, Florence Sweeney and Thomas
Stringer, on the vaudeville circuit, where they played as the
comedy team Steve and Flo. As a boy, he developed an interest in
jazz by listening to Fats Waller records, and by the time he left
high school he had picked up enough piano by ear to play in several
nonunion bands.
</P>
<P>
   In 1947 he began performing as a comedian in nightclubs in the
Philadelphia area, using original material rich with innuendo and
double-entendre. He made his New York debut two years later at Cafe
Society Downtown in Greenwich Village.
</P>
<P>
   Tall, with saucer-shaped eyes, curly black hair and a
gravel-edged voice, Graham preferred his humor pointed and topical.
His act parodied subjects ranging from the titles of 1950s movies
(``Quo Vadis/That's what I said the night we met/Quo Vadis/Means
whither goest thou, my pet?'') to Freudian psychoanalysis to Truman
Capote.
</P>
<P>
   In 1954 he appeared on Broadway in ``The Tender Trap,'' with Kim
Hunter and Robert Preston. He later turned to directing for the
stage, including ``Grin and Bare It,'' a 1969 Broadway comedy about
a family of nudists.
</P>
<P>
   Graham wrote episodes of the television series ``MASH,'' in
which he sometimes appeared, and was a consulting writer on ``The
Mary Tyler Moore Show.'' In the 1970s he was a guest on the
``Tonight'' show more than 60 times, usually performing updated
renditions of his original routines.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Stringer, of Los Angeles, he is survived by his
wife, Pamela Gill; two other sons, Julian Graham of Bridgewater,
Conn., and Hilmer Graham of Manhattan; two daughters, Nora Graham
of East Norwalk, Conn., and Timothi Graham of Manhattan; two
sisters, Edna Pastman of Burlington, N.J., and Annabelle McKenna of
Philadelphia, and a granddaughter.

SEISMIC ACTIVITY COULD MAKE FLAW UNFIXABLE AT BELMONT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY TERRI HARDY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO _ Constant seismic activity underneath the Belmont
Learning Center makes it impossible to create a fail-safe system
that would vent the explosive methane gas that plagues the site, an
environmental expert told a state commission Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Independent petroleum engineer Bernard Endres told the state's
Seismic Safety Commission that unique environmental problems and
location on top of a blind-thrust earthquake fault create a
dangerous situation that cannot be fixed at the $200 million
school.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any seismic activity impairs the integrity of methane barrier
seals,'' Endres said after he testified. He was the lead
investigator into the infamous methane gas explosion in the Fairfax
District in the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to his comments, Barry Groveman, an outside
environmental attorney and member of the Los Angeles Unified School
District's safety team, said the seismic effects on any proposed
system would need to be thoroughly evaluated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Questions like that deserve legitimate answers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Board of Education, with advice from the safety team, is
expected to decide as soon as next week whether to halt
construction at Belmont, at least temporarily. The board plans an
early decision on whether to abandon the project or finish what
would be the nation's costliest school.
</P>
<P>
   The state's Seismic Safety Commission cannot control the LAUSD
board's actions. After hearing the presentation on Belmont,
however, the commission agreed to study state laws and regulations
and determine whether there are holes in the system identifying
seismic problems at potential school sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to examine what the strengths and weaknesses in the
system are,'' said Richard McCarthy, executive director of the
Seismic Safety Commission.
</P>
<P>
   McCarthy expects a draft report to be ready in September, but
noted that the commission might not be able to meet then. Gov. Gray
Davis has yet to appoint nine new members to the 17-member
commission.
</P>
<P>
   Saying the system failed at Belmont, state Sens. Tom Hayden,
D-Los Angeles, and Richard Alarcon, D-Van Nuys, said there could be
other toxic problems in the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``The LAUSD alone is building 100 schools in the next five
years, and schools are going to be built throughout the state with
Proposition 1A bond money,'' Alarcon said. ``We need to learn from
the Belmont experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Endres and Hayden said concerns about seismic hazards at Belmont
were swept aside in the limited environmental reports done for the
school.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said the school was in an earthquake-prone area, as is
all of downtown, and it wasn't a problem,'' Hayden said. ``Here's a
school that's already a danger because it's on top of an active oil
field, but under that is an earthquake problem that will accelerate
the release of methane gas to the surface. Everyone turned a blind
eye.''
</P>
<P>
   Endres said the Belmont site is unique because it sits squarely
atop a blind-thrust fault, and there is a source of oil and methane
gas at the surface of the land. Conditions are different from those
at downtown sites such as the city library's, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of whether seismic activity could force oil and gas to
the surface is one of the first that should have been studied
before school officials decided whether the former oil field should
become a school site, Endres said.
</P>
<P>
   Commission members were astonished when Hayden said one of the
recommendations of the safety team in an initial report was not to
use the first floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'd have to warn people never to smoke on the first floor
because they'd kill everyone,'' Hayden said. ``This is a mess.''
</P>
<P>
   Hayden said there was a clear regulatory lapse that allowed the
land to be approved for a school site.
</P>
<P>
   The Daily News reported in October 1998 that state safeguards
failed at several sites, including those for Belmont and Jefferson
New Middle School, before construction started.
</P>
<P>
   Groveman said the Los Angeles safety team, attempting to
determine why crucial environmental work wasn't done, repeatedly
heard from representatives of agencies saying it was not their job.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just unacceptable,'' he said. ``There are a number of
places where (Belmont) could have been stopped, but it wasn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Groveman applauded the Seismic Safety Commission's decision to
look into the state's role in approving school sites. If the
systemic problems are not solved, ``there will be a repeat of this
somewhere else,'' he said.

 &HT;    
 &HT;    A CONVERSATION WITH VENEZUELA'S LUIS GIUSTI
 &HT;    Luis Giusti, former CEO of state-owned Petroleos de Venezuela
(PDVSA), has a lot of free time since resigning his post following
President Hugo Chavez's landslide victory last year. Giusti spoke
recently with LATIN TRADE Contributing Editor Claire Poole at a
meeting of the InterAmerican Chamber of Commerce in Houston. They
talked about his tenure at PDVSA, his falling-out with Venezuela's
president and his future plans. The following is an excerpt of the
interview:
 &HT;    
 &HT;    LT: How did you get off on such a wrong foot with Hugo Chavez?
 &HT;    GIUSTI: In politics, especially during campaigns, people take
unilateral positions.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Did you try to repair the relationship?
 &HT;    No. I simply acted in a very cordial and open manner. But I got
the message very clearly that if (Chavez) won, he would want other
people to run the show.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    What do you see as your legacy at Petroleos de Venezuela?
 &HT;    I would like to be remembered for three major things. One,
Petroleos de Venezuela management opened the oil sector and made
clear the difference between sovereignty issues and state control.
Second, we undertook a major corporate transformation to prepare
the company for competition in modern times. Finally, by creating a
competitive playing field, we're bringing Venezuelans closer to oil
and oil closer to Venezuelans.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    What's left that needs to be done?
 &HT;    Hydrocarbon retail sales have not been adequately reformed.
Measures in Congress fell short of our expectations and some work
is still needed to create a free market in distribution and in
retail. We also wanted wider private-sector participation in the
petrochemical sector. We didn't get that, either.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    How are Latin America's big state-owned oil companies, such as
PDVSA, Petrobras and Pemex, working together?
 &HT;    We've been working (with Petrobras) for a while. There was a
protocol signed at the highest level, but we haven't been able to
agree on the basic terms. We have a very close relationship with
Pemex to coordinate U.S. marketing activities. The possibility of
doing more in the future is not out of the question.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    So what are you doing these days?
 &HT;    I'm going to be spending some time with CSIS (Center for
Strategic and International Studies, a think tank) in Washington.
I'll be spending two days every month at Babson College
(Massachusetts) conducting seminars on public policy reforms in
Latin America. I'll be traveling frequently to New York to work
with a couple of institutions.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Do you hope to be president of Venezuela someday?
 &HT;    It's too early to think about that. But I will maintain a heavy,
intense presence in Venezuela. I will be writing in the newspaper
and doing television commentary once a month. And I will be in
close contact with PDVSA. I'm not leaving the country.
 &HT;    --------------------- 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    CORRUPTION: NORTH OF THE BORDER
 &HT;    HOUSTON _ Think the Mexican police and other government
officials are the only ones corrupted by Mexico's drug lords? Think
again. The U.S. Customs Service and the U.S. Immigration and
Naturalization Service have not done enough to prevent the
infiltration of Mexico's drug cartel's into their ranks along the
1,962-mile U.S.-Mexico border, says a recent U.S. General
Accounting Office report.
 &HT;    The GAO reviewed 28 cases involving INS and Customs employees
convicted of drug-related crimes between 1992 and 1997. Among the
more notable: Waving drug loads through ports of entry,
coordinating the movement of drugs across the border (using cell
phones and beepers to tell drug traffickers which lanes to use and
when), transporting drugs past border patrol checkpoints (sometimes
in government vehicles), selling drugs and disclosing drug
intelligence information.
 &HT;    ``Given the enormous sums of money being generated by drug
trafficking, the corruption of some INS and Customs employees along
the Southwest border is a serious and a continuing threat,''
concluded the report.
 &HT;    Coming to the defense of the agencies were Assistant Attorney
General Stephen Colgate and William Riley, Customs director of
planning. ``Twenty-eight instances of corruption out of 9,600
agents over about a six-year period is a commendable demonstration
of the integrity of ours and (Customs) personnel,'' said Colgate in
his letter to the GAO.
 &HT;    Still, the GAO is recommending that the two agencies institute
advanced integrity training, much like the U.S. Federal Bureau of
Investigation, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and the
U.S. Secret Service. The GAO also is suggesting the agencies
conduct ``reinvestigations'' of existing employees every five years
(most were overdue by three years and the agencies had a combined
backlog of 934 as of March 1998). Such reinvestigations can raise
red flags about personnel who might be tempted to accept bribes
from drug smugglers to pay down debts or appear to be living well
beyond their means.
 &HT;    Indeed, the GAO cited one border patrol agent who owned a
$200,000 house with an Olympic-sized swimming pool, five cars, one
van, two boats, 100 weapons, $45,000 in U.S. Treasury bills and 40
acres of land _ and carried no debt. Nice work if you can get away
with it.

RELAXED AND READY, WORLD CUP PLAYERS `EMBRACING THE MOMENT' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLAREMONT, Calif. _ Motorcycles. Uniformed cops on big, shiny
motorcycles revved down the soccer field toward the U.S. Women's
World Cup team.
</P>
<P>
   It was quite a strange sight.
</P>
<P>
   After practice Thursday, the Claremont police were on hand just
to make sure no one messed around with Mia Hamm, Julie Foudy,
Brandi Chastain or any of the other U.S. team members who have come
like a twister off the sports horizon, sweeping the nation in their
appealing fury.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of shrinking away from this official show of force, you
know what these U.S. players did?
</P>
<P>
   They climbed on the cycles like little kids at Jolly Rogers
Theme Park.
</P>
<P>
   Midfielder Kristine Lilly and a few other players put on
motorcycle helmets and went for little spin. Reserve Tiffany
Roberts hit the siren button, sending a ``whoop, whoop'' screech
through the air.
</P>
<P>
   Then the team called over some photographers so they could get
their pictures taken with the motorcycles and the police officers.
They giggled and waved.
</P>
<P>
   In such a loose, relaxed mood, who would guess the Women's World
Cup final was just two days away and that this U.S. team was
gunning to do nothing less than beat China for the coveted title?
</P>
<P>
   Well, Colleen Hacker, the U.S. team's full-time sports
psychologist, would tell you this is exactly the right mood for
this team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to embrace the moment. We're not looking behind us.
We're not looking ahead. That's how these guys are. We have this
moment and this time and we want to embrace it,'' Hacker said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And rather than seeing them as acting loose and relaxed, I
would say you're seeing them embracing the moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Hacker, a professor and assistant dean at Pacific Lutheran
University, has been working with the U.S. Women since 1995 _ the
year the U.S. lost in the semifinals during the last World Cup and
something, someone was needed to come in and help these elite
soccer players achieve their potential.
</P>
<P>
   Hacker was hired by U.S. coach Tony DiCicco after he begged U.S.
Soccer to fund the sports psychologist position. And with Hacker in
place, available for one-on-ones and group exercises, the U.S.
women went on to win 25 of 28 matches in 1996, including the
Olympic gold medal match.
</P>
<P>
   Hacker was a soccer coach at PLU for 17 years, winning three
NAIA national titles, in 1988, '89 and '91. But she resigned as PLU
coach in '95 when she was asked to work with the U.S. National
Team.
</P>
<P>
   Although she has worked with U.S. Rowing and the U.S. Tennis
Association and been wooed by NFL teams to come work with them,
Hacker said she is deeply committed to this team and is providing
some serious techniques (imagery, stress management, self-talk,
goal-setting and relaxation) to help make them winners.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you ask the elite athletes _ and I'm talking Olympic,
world-class athletes _ what are the 10 qualities that separate
success from failure, the top five were all psychological skills.
In sixth place was physical ability, Hacker said.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Hacker _ who has a sports psychology degree from the
University of Arizona and a doctorate from the University of Oregon
_ talked about the ability of this U.S. team to handle the world
stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can say this is unprecedented, how will they handle this,
but it was unprecedented during the '96 Olympics, so we have been
here before. They're not going around counting what papers are
here, what cameras. We've had papers around. We've had cameras.
We've had the largest crowds in history. We've been here. We draw
on our experience,'' Hacker said.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to deny that these U.S. women have some sort of
special, strong, psychological composure. That much was evident
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Probably the reason soccer officials picked Pomona College as
the training site for the Women's World Cup finals was because its
campus is small, pretty, quiet and _ since it is 30 miles east of
downtown Los Angeles _ out of the way.
</P>
<P>
   At least it used to be out of the way. Thursday, quiet little
Pomona was the center of the universe, or at least it felt that
way.
</P>
<P>
   The Beatles were in town _ at least that's what this U.S. team
seems like, attracting Tom Brokaw, Newsweek and a crowd to
Thursday's practice that swelled to more than 3,500 cheering
spectators.
</P>
<P>
   Heck, even actor Karl Malden came out and watched at the edge of
the soccer field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ever practice in front of Karl Malden before?'' someone asked
Mia Hamm.
</P>
<P>
   Hamm simply smiled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you ever think this team would inspire this sort of
interest?'' someone else asked wise-cracking midfielder Foudy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, because we have always felt this team was the best-kept
secret,'' Foudy said. ``Not because of how well we play soccer but
because of the people who are on this team.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the same group of athletes who demanded they be coached
like men but treated like women, since team and feelings are
important.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in the face of all this World Cup hype and attention, this
very special team is demonstrating remarkable focus, poise and
spontaneity, as well as _ pardon the expression, but it fits _
athletic cockiness.
</P>
<P>
   They manage all of this while also extending a generous
graciousness to anyone who comes into their orbit. Try asking that
of some NBA, NFL or major league baseball teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell them, `Your attitude is like a paintbrush. You can
color any situation. So what is the spirit? What is the attitude
you bring to this?''' Hacker said.
</P>
<P>
   Their spirit and attitude are inspiring, quite frankly. And it
is this team's chemistry, karma and sense of destiny that very well
could help them overcome a dangerous opponent in China on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, their psychology coach has already made them
winners within.

<TEXT>
<P>
   He took office this week promising to end ``the 100-year
conflict'' in the Middle East. If he goes for it, Ehud Barak has a
better hope than any previous Israeli prime minister of bringing
this off.
</P>
<P>
   He was elected with a resounding personal vote of confidence, he
is backed by a comfortable majority in parliament, no section of
which is in a position to block the way to peace, and his choice of
ministers signals that he will be running things in the way he
wants.
</P>
<P>
   He faces Arab leaders whose relief at the departure of the
previous Israeli government makes them receptive to the new one.
</P>
<P>
   The chance of peace, at least at this initial stage, is Barak's
to squander. First impressions are good. The prime minister is to
pay a quick call on his neighbors _ Egypt's Hosni Mubarak, the
Palestinians' Yasser Arafat and Jordan's King Abdullah _ before he
goes off to see Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   His first speech to the Knesset, in which he made a plea for ``a
peace of the brave,'' was in stirring contrast to Benjamin
Netanyahu's deep-freezing of the process.
</P>
<P>
   No less important, he tried to reassure Palestinians and others
who doubt his priorities: the pursuit of a permanent Palestinian
settlement was as ``vital and urgent'' to him as winning peace with
Syria and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   His commitment to get Israeli soldiers out of Lebanon within a
year, and his own instincts as a former chief of staff, had
suggested that he might pour his energies into the Syrian pot.
</P>
<P>
   Asked by an interviewer from Israel's Haaretz newspaper whether
he agreed with the late Yitzhak Rabin that the Palestinian problem
was at the heart of the Jewish-Arab conflict, Barak replied with an
inventory of Syria's arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, said Barak, the Palestinians ``are the weakest of
all our adversaries. As a military threat they are ludicrous.''
</P>
<P>
   But, as Barak acknowledged, the Palestinians give legitimacy to
the Arabs' continuing grievance against Israel. Put another way,
until the Palestinian problem is solved, Israel's existence will
continue to Arabs to seem illegitimate.
</P>
<P>
   No arrangement that Israel makes with an Arab state will be
normal while the Palestinians' status remains indeterminate: the
20-year-old cold peace with Egypt provides a convincing example of
that. However important peace with Syria, regional stability still
depends on an Israeli-Palestinian settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Like Netanyahu, Barak would have liked to skip the unfinished
business left over from the interim agreement, including the
withdrawal prescribed at the Wye summit in Maryland last October,
and go straight to negotiating a final settlement with Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   There is a case for that: Barak, unlike Netanyahu, would be
negotiating in good faith, and experience shows that a drawn-out
process invites trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Why waste time and goodwill when there is a chance of achieving
a decent and lasting solution? The answer is that the Palestinians,
as weak as Barak described them, are fearful of being exploited.
</P>
<P>
   They agree that talks on a final deal should not be further
delayed, but they want to enter them in control of the one-third or
so of the West Bank they have so far been allotted.
</P>
<P>
   With good cause to be distrustful, they need the reassurance of
seeing an Israeli government honestly implementing signed
agreements. That first step needs to be taken swiftly, without the
prevarications of the Netanyahu government, while preparing for the
all-important final talks.
</P>
<P>
   The target date for a deal is next May, a year later than
originally scheduled. This is tight, but it could be met if the
opportunity were grasped.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has shown decisively that he is his own man. Now he has to
show that he is the man who can make peace. &QL;

 &HT;    
 &HT;    UNA CONVERSACION CON LUIS GIUSTI DE VENEZUELA
 &HT;    Luis Giusti, ex presidente ejecutivo de la estatal Petroleos de
Venezuela (PDVSA), tiene mucho tiempo libre desde que renuncio a su
puesto despues que Hugo Chavez fue electo presidente. Giusti hablo
recientemente con Claire Poole, editora especial de Latin Trade, en
una reunion de la Camara de Comercio Interamericano en Houston.
Hablaron sobre su periodo en PDVSA, sus diferencias con el
presidente de Venezuela y sus planes. Lo que sigue es un fragmento
de la entrevista. El texto completo esta en nuestro website
www.latintrade.com.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    LT: Por que tuvo tan mala suerte con Hugo Chavez?
 &HT;    GIUSTI: En politica, sobre todo durante las campanas, la gente
toma posiciones unilaterales.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Trato de arreglar la relacion?
 &HT;    No. Sencillamente fue cordial y abierto. Pero recibi con mucha
claridad el mensaje de que si (Chavez ganaba, le gustaria que otra
persona dirigiera el espectaculo.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Que considera que fue su legado en Petroleos de Venezuela?
 &HT;    Me gustaria que me recordaran por tres cosas. Primero, la
administracion de Petroleos de Venezuela abrio el sector petrolero
y aclaro la diferencia entre asuntos de soberania y control
estatal. Segundo, realizamos una gran transformacion para preparar
a la compania con vistas a la competencia de esta epoca. Por
ultimo, al crear un terreno competitivo, acercamos a los
venezolanos al petroleo y el petroleo a los venezolanos.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Que queda por hacer?
 &HT;    Las ventas al detalle de hidrocarburos no se han reformado
adecuadamente. Las medidas del Congreso no estuvieron a la altura
de nuestras expectativas y todavia hay que trabajar en la creacion
de un mercado libre en la distribucion y la venta al detalle.
Tambien queriamos una mayor participacion del sector privado en la
petroquimica. Tampoco lo conseguimos.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Como trabajan juntas las grandes petroleras estatales de America
Latina, como PDVSA, Petrobras y Pemex?
 &HT;    Hemos trabajado (con Petrobras por bastante tiempo. Se firmo un
protocolo al mas alto nivel, pero no hemos llegado a un acuerdo en
las cuestiones basicas. Tenemos una relacion muy estrecha con Pemex
para coordinar las actividades de mercadeo en Estados Unidos. La
posibilidad de hacer mas en el futuro no esta descartada.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Que hace en estos dias?
 &HT;    Voy a pasar un tiempo con CSIS (Centro de Estudios Estrategicos
e Internacionales en Washington. Pasare dos dias al mes en Babson
College (Massachusetts dando seminarios sobre reformas de politica
estatal en America Latina. Viajare con frecuencia a Nueva York para
trabajar con dos instituciones.
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Espera ser presidente de Venezuela algun dia?
 &HT;    Es muy pronto para pensar en eso. Pero mantendre una presencia
muy intensa en Venezuela. Escribire en la prensa y hare comentarios
en la television una vez al mes. Y estare en estrecho contacto con
PDVSA. No estoy abandonando el pais.
 &HT;    --------------------- 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    CORRUPCION: AL NORTE DEL RIO GRANDE
 &HT;    Usted cree que la policia y otras autoridades mexicanas son los
unicos corrompidos por los narcotraficantes de ese pais? Pues se
equivoca. El Servicio de Aduanas y el Servicio de Inmigracion y
Naturalizacion de Estados Unidos no han hecho lo suficiente para
impedir la infiltracion de los carteles mexicanos del narcotrafico
en sus filas en la frontera de 3.200 kilometros entre ambos paises,
segun un reciente informe de la Oficina de Fiscalizacion del
Congreso (GAO en ingles).
 &HT;    La GAO encontro una gran cantidad de actividades ilegales al
revisar 28 casos de empleados del INS y de Aduanas declarados
culpables de delitos de drogas entre 1992 y 1997. Entre los casos
mas notables: dejar pasar cargamentos de drogas, coordinar el
movimiento de narcoticos en la frontera (usando telefonos celulares
y localizadores electronicos para indicar a los traficantes la
mejor forma de entrar), transportar drogas a traves de controles en
la frontera (a veces en vehiculos gubernamentales), vender drogas y
revelar informacion secreta sobre los estupefacientes. ``Dadas las
enormes sumas que genera el narcotrafico, la corrupcion de algunos
empleados del INS y de Aduanas en la frontera (con Mexico es una
amenaza grave y constante,'' concluye el informe.
 &HT;    Stephen Colgate, subsecretario de Justicia, y William Riley,
director de planificacion de Aduanas, salieron en defensa de las
agencias. ``Veintiocho casos de corrupcion entre 9.600 agentes en
seis anos es una demostracion de la integridad de nuestro personal
y el de la Aduana,'' senalo Colgate en una carta a la GAO.
 &HT;    No obstante, la GAO recomienda que las dos entidades instituyan
un plan avanzado de integridad, muy parecido al que tienen la
Oficina Federal de Investigaciones (FBI), la Direccion de Lucha
Contra las Drogas (DEA) y el Servicio Secreto. La GAO tambien
sugiere que las entidades investiguen a sus empleados cada cinco
anos. La mayoria de las investigaciones tenian un retraso de tres
anos y las agencias tenian un total de casos combinados de 934 en
marzo de 1998. La GAO menciono el caso de un agente de la patrulla
fronteriza que tenia una casa de US$200.000 con una piscina
olimpica, cinco automoviles, una furgoneta, 100 armas, US$45.000 en
bonos del Tesoro, 16 hectareas de tierra y ninguna deuda. Un buen
patrimonio, siempre que se pueda escapar de la Justicia.

<TEXT>
<P>
   He took office this week promising to end ``the 100-year
conflict'' in the Middle East. If he goes for it, Ehud Barak has a
better hope than any previous Israeli prime minister of bringing
this off.
</P>
<P>
   He was elected with a resounding personal vote of confidence, he
is backed by a comfortable majority in parliament, no section of
which is in a position to block the way to peace, and his choice of
ministers signals that he will be running things in the way he
wants.
</P>
<P>
   He faces Arab leaders whose relief at the departure of the
previous Israeli government makes them receptive to the new one.
</P>
<P>
   The chance of peace, at least at this initial stage, is Barak's
to squander. First impressions are good. The prime minister is to
pay a quick call on his neighbors _ Egypt's Hosni Mubarak, the
Palestinians' Yasser Arafat and Jordan's King Abdullah _ before he
goes off to see Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   His first speech to the Knesset, in which he made a plea for ``a
peace of the brave,'' was in stirring contrast to Benjamin
Netanyahu's deep-freezing of the process.
</P>
<P>
   No less important, he tried to reassure Palestinians and others
who doubt his priorities: the pursuit of a permanent Palestinian
settlement was as ``vital and urgent'' to him as winning peace with
Syria and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   His commitment to get Israeli soldiers out of Lebanon within a
year, and his own instincts as a former chief of staff, had
suggested that he might pour his energies into the Syrian pot.
</P>
<P>
   Asked by an interviewer from Israel's Haaretz newspaper whether
he agreed with the late Yitzhak Rabin that the Palestinian problem
was at the heart of the Jewish-Arab conflict, Barak replied with an
inventory of Syria's arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, said Barak, the Palestinians ``are the weakest of
all our adversaries. As a military threat they are ludicrous.''
</P>
<P>
   But, as Barak acknowledged, the Palestinians give legitimacy to
the Arabs' continuing grievance against Israel. Put another way,
until the Palestinian problem is solved, Israel's existence will
continue to Arabs to seem illegitimate.
</P>
<P>
   No arrangement that Israel makes with an Arab state will be
normal while the Palestinians' status remains indeterminate: the
20-year-old cold peace with Egypt provides a convincing example of
that. However important peace with Syria, regional stability still
depends on an Israeli-Palestinian settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Like Netanyahu, Barak would have liked to skip the unfinished
business left over from the interim agreement, including the
withdrawal prescribed at the Wye summit in Maryland last October,
and go straight to negotiating a final settlement with Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   There is a case for that: Barak, unlike Netanyahu, would be
negotiating in good faith, and experience shows that a drawn-out
process invites trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Why waste time and goodwill when there is a chance of achieving
a decent and lasting solution? The answer is that the Palestinians,
as weak as Barak described them, are fearful of being exploited.
</P>
<P>
   They agree that talks on a final deal should not be further
delayed, but they want to enter them in control of the one-third or
so of the West Bank they have so far been allotted.
</P>
<P>
   With good cause to be distrustful, they need the reassurance of
seeing an Israeli government honestly implementing signed
agreements. That first step needs to be taken swiftly, without the
prevarications of the Netanyahu government, while preparing for the
all-important final talks.
</P>
<P>
   The target date for a deal is next May, a year later than
originally scheduled. This is tight, but it could be met if the
opportunity were grasped.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has shown decisively that he is his own man. Now he has to
show that he is the man who can make peace. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Meet the face that is threatening to give Asia its very own
Cuban-style missile crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Jong Il's plans to test another long-range missile over the
Pacific have caused such alarm in South Korea, Japan and the United
States that the North Korean leader may yet blink. But then again,
he may not.
</P>
<P>
   The reclusive Kim is one of the last survivors of
unreconstructed communism. His country is on its uppers. His people
are hungry. He is without friends, save perhaps a reluctant China.
And he has just one aim: to stay in power.
</P>
<P>
   He may think that infuriating his neighbors is the best way of
doing so. For everyone's sake, Kim needs to be persuaded that
launching another rocket _ the one he fired across Japan last
August caused consternation all around _ will do him no good.
</P>
<P>
   He is, however, a difficult man to persuade of anything,
especially when the message he receives is confused. And that is
what has happened in the past.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea has long been at work on a secret nuclear program.
Five years ago, when it provocatively unloaded the plutonium-rich
core of its main nuclear reactor without international inspection,
and threatened to pull out of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty,
the program began to look increasingly sinister.
</P>
<P>
   The North's neighbors, however, failed to respond with one
voice. South Korea and Japan dithered, fearful of provoking a
military clash with such a hostile and unpredictable regime. China
flatly opposed America's efforts to impose sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Americans were left to negotiate a deal that will
eventually reward North Korea with two western-designed nuclear
reactors in return for an end to its mischievous plutonium
reprocessing. Since then North Korea's economic problems have gone
from grave to grotesque.
</P>
<P>
   Though Kim is ready to pay for expensive rocketry, he relies on
outside help to feed his people, chief among them his cronies and
the soldiers who keep him in power.
</P>
<P>
   Is there, in this paradox, a chance for leverage? Many have
thought so.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea has recently been offered a bundle of inducements _
diplomatic recognition and an easing of remaining trade sanctions
by America, huge dollops of aid from South Korea, with still more
in prospect eventually from Japan _ so long as the freeze on its
nuclear program continues and it stops testing and selling its
long-range rockets.
</P>
<P>
   But the lesson Kim seems to have learned from the 1994 nuclear
bribe is that the worse he behaves, the more desperately outsiders
will try to buy him off. He is now almost certainly hoping for more
rewards.
</P>
<P>
   The time has come to disabuse him. Unfortunately, China, which
does not want to see North Korea collapse into the arms of
capitalist South Korea, and worries lest the flow of hungry
refugees across its border should become a flood, keeps supporting
Kim.
</P>
<P>
   It does so with supplies of food and fuel which, unlike the
carefully monitored deliveries of oil that are provided until the
new reactors are ready, or the humanitarian aid that the rest of
the world sends, probably goes straight into army stores.
</P>
<P>
   South Korea, reasoning that talking is better than shooting,
recently offered fertilizer just to persuade North Korea to show up
for talks. The trouble is that talking with the North never yields
anything.
</P>
<P>
   Even America seems to have been blackmailed. Only after a
promise of more food aid was it allowed to inspect a suspicious
excavation in order to assuage its worries that North Korea was
planning to restart its nuclear program.
</P>
<P>
   The world is right to dread seeing North Koreans starve because
of the folly of their master. The difficulty is that, without
sticks as well as carrots, Kim has no incentive to change his
behavior, whether it is sending submarines and torpedo boats into
South Korean waters, or firing ever more powerful rockets that
could some day carry nuclear, chemical or biological warheads.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Kim, convinced he can get away with anything, may be
about to overplay his hand.
</P>
<P>
   For once, all of North Korea's neighbors see a common threat,
even if they are still divided over what to do about it.
</P>
<P>
   Although South Korea is still more worried about Kim's
short-range guns, which can easily hit its capital Seoul, another
rocket over the Pacific would make the South's ``sunshine policy''
towards the North _ a policy that separates political differences
from economic contacts _ look decidedly silly.
</P>
<P>
   It would also put an end to the plans to buy off Kim's nuclear
ambitions with nuclear reactors. Most of the money for the project
comes from South Korea and Japan, but some cash and almost all the
political leadership comes from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Neither America's Congress nor Japan's Diet would continue to
pay up if North Korea were building, testing and probably selling
to others new means to threaten their security.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea's missile madness will top the agenda as Japan's
prime minister visits China this week. And for once, China is
rattled too.
</P>
<P>
   It may not expect to be the target of North Korea's new
missiles, but Kim's unannounced rocket test last August blew a hole
through China's regional diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
   Until then China had been leaning on Japan not to join America
in research on anti-missile defenses. Now research will start.
</P>
<P>
   America is keen to have extra protection for its troops in Asia
and elsewhere. China worries that even limited defenses will
undermine its nuclear deterrent, and is anxious that America will
extend such defenses to Taiwan, which China claims as its own.
(Indeed, three years ago China itself showed how useful better
defenses could be to Taiwan, when it lobbed missiles into the sea
lanes near the island in an attempt to intimidate Taiwanese
voters.)
</P>
<P>
   Now that North Korea's preparations for a new test have got
everyone's attention, what can usefully be done?
</P>
<P>
   The response this time should be simple, and unanimous. It
should be to advise North Korea, first, to take the goodies on
offer and forget about any more missile tests.
</P>
<P>
   But this message is most unlikely to be heeded unless it is
accompanied by another: that if any test goes ahead, not only will
the offers of aid, trade and diplomatic recognition be withdrawn,
but severe economic sanctions will be applied.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, China would be deeply reluctant to go along with
that. It hates to see a fellow communist country _ however
exasperating _ chastised. That is why China, as North Korea's
propper-upper of last resort, could do more than any other to
persuade Kim to take the diplomatic way out.
</P>
<P>
   The choice is as stark for China as it is for America, South
Korea and Japan. It is either to allow North Korea to set off a
destabilizing new round of suspicion, rivalry and even fighting in
East Asia, or to persuade Kim to back down. &QL;

   Kim Jong Il's plans to test another long-range missile over the
Pacific have caused such alarm in South Korea, Japan and the United
States that the North Korean leader may yet blink. But then again,
he may not.
</P>
<P>
   The reclusive Kim is one of the last survivors of
unreconstructed communism. His country is on its uppers. His people
are hungry. He is without friends, save perhaps a reluctant China.
And he has just one aim: to stay in power.
</P>
<P>
   He may think that infuriating his neighbors is the best way of
doing so. For everyone's sake, Kim needs to be persuaded that
launching another rocket _ the one he fired across Japan last
August caused consternation all around _ will do him no good.
</P>
<P>
   He is, however, a difficult man to persuade of anything,
especially when the message he receives is confused. And that is
what has happened in the past.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea has long been at work on a secret nuclear program.
Five years ago, when it provocatively unloaded the plutonium-rich
core of its main nuclear reactor without international inspection,
and threatened to pull out of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty,
the program began to look increasingly sinister.
</P>
<P>
   The North's neighbors, however, failed to respond with one
voice. South Korea and Japan dithered, fearful of provoking a
military clash with such a hostile and unpredictable regime. China
flatly opposed America's efforts to impose sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Americans were left to negotiate a deal that will
eventually reward North Korea with two western-designed nuclear
reactors in return for an end to its mischievous plutonium
reprocessing. Since then North Korea's economic problems have gone
from grave to grotesque.
</P>
<P>
   Though Kim is ready to pay for expensive rocketry, he relies on
outside help to feed his people, chief among them his cronies and
the soldiers who keep him in power.
</P>
<P>
   Is there, in this paradox, a chance for leverage? Many have
thought so.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea has recently been offered a bundle of inducements _
diplomatic recognition and an easing of remaining trade sanctions
by America, huge dollops of aid from South Korea, with still more
in prospect eventually from Japan _ so long as the freeze on its
nuclear program continues and it stops testing and selling its
long-range rockets.
</P>
<P>
   But the lesson Kim seems to have learned from the 1994 nuclear
bribe is that the worse he behaves, the more desperately outsiders
will try to buy him off. He is now almost certainly hoping for more
rewards.
</P>
<P>
   The time has come to disabuse him. Unfortunately, China, which
does not want to see North Korea collapse into the arms of
capitalist South Korea, and worries lest the flow of hungry
refugees across its border should become a flood, keeps supporting
Kim.
</P>
<P>
   It does so with supplies of food and fuel which, unlike the
carefully monitored deliveries of oil that are provided until the
new reactors are ready, or the humanitarian aid that the rest of
the world sends, probably goes straight into army stores.
</P>
<P>
   South Korea, reasoning that talking is better than shooting,
recently offered fertilizer just to persuade North Korea to show up
for talks. The trouble is that talking with the North never yields
anything.
</P>
<P>
   Even America seems to have been blackmailed. Only after a
promise of more food aid was it allowed to inspect a suspicious
excavation in order to assuage its worries that North Korea was
planning to restart its nuclear program.
</P>
<P>
   The world is right to dread seeing North Koreans starve because
of the folly of their master. The difficulty is that, without
sticks as well as carrots, Kim has no incentive to change his
behavior, whether it is sending submarines and torpedo boats into
South Korean waters, or firing ever more powerful rockets that
could some day carry nuclear, chemical or biological warheads.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Kim, convinced he can get away with anything, may be
about to overplay his hand.
</P>
<P>
   For once, all of North Korea's neighbors see a common threat,
even if they are still divided over what to do about it.
</P>
<P>
   Although South Korea is still more worried about Kim's
short-range guns, which can easily hit its capital Seoul, another
rocket over the Pacific would make the South's ``sunshine policy''
towards the North _ a policy that separates political differences
from economic contacts _ look decidedly silly.
</P>
<P>
   It would also put an end to the plans to buy off Kim's nuclear
ambitions with nuclear reactors. Most of the money for the project
comes from South Korea and Japan, but some cash and almost all the
political leadership comes from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Neither America's Congress nor Japan's Diet would continue to
pay up if North Korea were building, testing and probably selling
to others new means to threaten their security.
</P>
<P>
   North Korea's missile madness will top the agenda as Japan's
prime minister visits China this week. And for once, China is
rattled too.
</P>
<P>
   It may not expect to be the target of North Korea's new
missiles, but Kim's unannounced rocket test last August blew a hole
through China's regional diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
   Until then China had been leaning on Japan not to join America
in research on anti-missile defenses. Now research will start.
</P>
<P>
   America is keen to have extra protection for its troops in Asia
and elsewhere. China worries that even limited defenses will
undermine its nuclear deterrent, and is anxious that America will
extend such defenses to Taiwan, which China claims as its own.
(Indeed, three years ago China itself showed how useful better
defenses could be to Taiwan, when it lobbed missiles into the sea
lanes near the island in an attempt to intimidate Taiwanese
voters.)
</P>
<P>
   Now that North Korea's preparations for a new test have got
everyone's attention, what can usefully be done?
</P>
<P>
   The response this time should be simple, and unanimous. It
should be to advise North Korea, first, to take the goodies on
offer and forget about any more missile tests.
</P>
<P>
   But this message is most unlikely to be heeded unless it is
accompanied by another: that if any test goes ahead, not only will
the offers of aid, trade and diplomatic recognition be withdrawn,
but severe economic sanctions will be applied.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, China would be deeply reluctant to go along with
that. It hates to see a fellow communist country _ however
exasperating _ chastised. That is why China, as North Korea's
propper-upper of last resort, could do more than any other to
persuade Kim to take the diplomatic way out.
</P>
<P>
   The choice is as stark for China as it is for America, South
Korea and Japan. It is either to allow North Korea to set off a
destabilizing new round of suspicion, rivalry and even fighting in
East Asia, or to persuade Kim to back down. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ America's melting pot can sometimes boil over, and
violently.
</P>
<P>
   On July 2, Benjamin Smith, a 21-year-old university student and
avowed white supremacist, apparently began a three-day, two-state
shooting spree in which he killed a black and a Korean and injured
nine Jews, blacks and Asians.
</P>
<P>
   On the evening of July 2, according to the police and the FBI,
Smith fired shots from his blue Ford Taurus at six Orthodox Jews as
they walked home from Sabbath prayers in a Chicago suburb.
</P>
<P>
   Less than half an hour later, in Skokie, he apparently shot and
killed Ricky Byrdsong, a black man who was the former basketball
coach of Northwestern University; Byrdsong was jogging with his
children when he was shot in the back.
</P>
<P>
   A short time later and several towns away, an Asian man and
woman were shot at while they were driving.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, as police struggled to connect the shootings,
Smith turned up in central Illinois where, in separate incidents,
he seems to have fired shots at several black men, a black
minister, and a Taiwanese man standing on a street corner with a
group of Asian men.
</P>
<P>
   Smith then crossed the state line to Bloomington, Ind. On July
4, Won Joon Yoon, an Indiana University graduate student, was shot
and killed outside a Korean church.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly 48 hours after the shooting spree began, the police
responded to a carjacking and gave chase to a van Smith had stolen
after ditching his car, which was now widely recognized. Before the
police could take him into custody, he shot himself and later died.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest clue to this rampage may be Smith's involvement in
the World Church of the Creator, a white-supremacist, anti-Semitic,
anti-Christian organization founded in Florida in the early 1970s
and now based in East Peoria, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   The World Church has declared a ``racial holy war'' against
non-whites, who are deemed to be inferior ``mud races'' that
jeopardize the prosperity and integrity of whites.
</P>
<P>
   The 27-year-old leader of the group, Matthew Hale, recruited
Smith while he was a student at the University of Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   ``The blacks and non-whites are taking this country right from
under us,'' Hale told a National Public Radio interviewer after the
shootings. ``We are becoming a niggerfied, Jewified, Mongolfied
country, and it's disgusting. We have to stop it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hale insists his organization does not embrace violence, yet he
has refused to express remorse over the shootings.
</P>
<P>
   Harlan Loeb, the region's counsel for the Anti-Defamation
League, a Jewish civil-rights organization, reckons that the World
Church of the Creator is one of the fastest-growing white supremacy
groups in the country.
</P>
<P>
   The membership figures are notoriously unreliable, but the
organization claims to have 7,000 members in nearly 40 chapters
spread around the country. And the World Church is not unique.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Web has been an absolute boon for hate groups,'' says
Loeb.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago the Simon Wiesenthal Institute, an international
human-rights organization, identified a single hate website; a
study finished this month found over 1,800 such sites.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet reaches into places where hate groups have never
gone before: homes, offices, schools. Attractive websites can drape
fringe ideas with a certain respectability.
</P>
<P>
   The medium is particularly well suited for reaching angry social
outcasts, who find comfort in the Web's anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Some websites cleverly ensnare schoolchildren. A student doing a
report on Martin Luther King, for example, might stumble upon the
site mlking.org, offering ``complete facts and documentation'' of
his life. The site is not sponsored by a museum or library; it was
created by a white supremacist who has his own views about King's
place in history.
</P>
<P>
   In Smith's case, his racism seemed to grow slowly. At the
University of Illinois he studied environmental sciences, but
later, after he had met Hale, he went to the University of Indiana
in Bloomington and switched to criminal justice in a department
specializing in crimes against minorities.
</P>
<P>
   His apparent rampage flies in the face of two common notions
about racism: first, that it thrives best during tough economic
times, when hard-up workers see minorities snapping up precious
jobs; and, second, that it is whites at the bottom of the economic
barrel who find the racist message most alluring.
</P>
<P>
   The American economy could hardly be in better shape, and Smith
was far from the bottom of the ladder. He was brought up in one of
Chicago's most affluent suburbs, where his father was a doctor and
his mother was a real-estate agent and member of the town council.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely nobody is immune,'' says the Anti-Defamation
League's Loeb, who compares the psychology of racial hatred to drug
addiction.
</P>
<P>
   Individuals with low self-esteem, he believes, seize upon racist
doctrine to overcome feelings of inadequacy. And, as with drugs, it
can be a powerfully self-destructive urge.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Abraham Cooper, associate dean of the Simon Wiesenthal
Institute, thinks the problem will not correct itself, and would
like to see more social responsibility on the part of Internet
providers.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the government must sort out the messy compromises
that balance free speech on the Web against the violence it may
inspire, as it has with every other kind of expression.
</P>
<P>
   And then, of course, there is the prodigious task of influencing
the growing number of people who find the messages of hate so
attractive in the first place. &QL;

<P>
   Name-recognition is an asset craved by all politicians. Some,
like George W. Bush, inherit it or, like Elizabeth Dole, gain it by
marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Others buy it: witness the current television commercials of
Steve Forbes, crafted in a grainy black-and-white to make the
billionaire publisher look more like a leader than an oddball.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Buchanan, with neither inheritance nor a personal fortune,
uses his popularity as a pugnacious TV pundit. John McCain relies
on his past as a war hero.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, among these and other contenders in the contest for the
Republicans' presidential nomination, surely none has a name quite
as recognizable as Dan Quayle.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Quayle has gained recognition through ridicule.
</P>
<P>
   He was the American vice-president (a heartbeat away from the
position held by the father of George W.) who on a classroom visit
in New Jersey chalked up a misspelled ``potatoe'' in front of the
television cameras; who declared that he ``didn't live in this
century''; who is derisively caricatured in the Doonesbury comic
strip as a feather.
</P>
<P>
   The cruelty of journalism is that no profile of Quayle, not even
by Economist's gentle pundit, Lexington, is complete without a list
of Quayle gaffes.
</P>
<P>
   But does the vice-president (the title may be out-of-date, but
it has its uses) object? Hasn't the press been pretty mean to him?
</P>
<P>
   ``Incredibly mean,'' comes the answer _ but with a sparkle in

   Clearly, Quayle is not a man to bear grudges, and, even if he
were, he would be clever enough to hide them. After all,
recognition, however gained, is still an asset: it may just

   How early is a function of two things: the preeminence of George
W. and the electoral calendar.
</P>
<P>
   In just six months Bush has raised an astonishing $36.3 million
_ double the amount collected by Al Gore, the Democrats'
front-runner, and almost nine times more than any other Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle, even though he has spent the past six years preparing
for the 2000 nomination, has managed a mere $3.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Given that the nomination will be sewn up in March, when big
states such as California, New York, Florida and Texas all hold
their primaries, how can any candidates other than Bush, with his
war chest, and Forbes, with his deep pockets, survive beyond
spring?
</P>
<P>
   The immediate answer for Quayle is to do well in Iowa, first in
the straw poll on Aug. 14 in Ames (candidates will give voters a
$25 entrance ticket, a free bus ride to Ames and free food once
they are there), and then in the caucus on Feb. 7.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well'' is a measure left undefined, but what it clearly
involves is that in the Ames straw poll Bush should fall short of
his hubristic target of more than 50 percent, and that Quayle
should do better than fellow conservatives such as Gary Bauer or
John Kasich.
</P>
<P>
   As Quayle's clever campaign director puts it, the money may not
be good but with matching funds there is more than enough for the
Iowa caucus and the New Hampshire primary the next day.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question that looms is electability. For us the straw poll

   But, if they drop out, does Quayle really become more electable
simply because he is still standing?
</P>
<P>
   Before a crowd of friendly Iowans gathered in a room at the
Washington County Hospital, he draws a ripple of laughter by
recalling his brave but disastrous 1992 criticism of the TV
character Murphy Brown's decision to become an unmarried mother:
``It was like I'd launched a nuke. I'm proud to say that I'm still
here fighting for the American family, and Murphy Brown is gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the good humor and the passing of time will make the
ridicule (``the cost of doing business,'' says the campaign
director) fade into insignificance. After all, Quayle has become a
master of staying ``on message,'' whether talking to Larry King on
CNN or chatting to small-town Iowans. &QL;

   As he discards the onions from his lunchtime salad _ politicians
need to be careful _ Quayle praises the Midwestern characteristics
of Iowa: ``This is real America, with real people and real
values.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed: and by implication the Midwestern Quayle, elected to the
House of Representatives from Indiana at the age of 29, to the
Senate at 33 and to the vice-presidency at 41, would be the perfect
defender of those values in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   So why do so few Americans, even in his own party, believe in
the concept of President Quayle?
</P>
<P>
   One reason is clearly the George W. Effect, which amazes Quayle
and the pundits alike. Another is perhaps that a lot of Americans
think his ``Midwestern values'' are a mite simplistic (though
Quayle bristles at the notion that he is more comfortable in rural
than inner-city America).
</P>
<P>
   But, ironically, the third has to do with George Bush senior.
All politicians commit gaffes: Al Gore, for example, was supposedly
the inspiration for ``Love Story.''
</P>
<P>
   The difference is that Bill Clinton has treated his
vice-president with a respect and seriousness that President Bush
withheld from Quayle.
</P>
<P>
   That is why Gore's gaffes evoke amused smiles and Quayle's only
condescending sneers. And it is why Quayle, like a small boy
playing basketball with people very much taller, will surely end up
looking brave rather than triumphant.
</P>
<P>
   As he puts it: ``I don't think about losing _ and I have a lot
of love for my country, win or lose.'' &QL;

<P>
   Name-recognition is an asset craved by all politicians. Some,
like George W. Bush, inherit it or, like Elizabeth Dole, gain it by
marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Others buy it: witness the current television commercials of
Steve Forbes, crafted in a grainy black-and-white to make the
billionaire publisher look more like a leader than an oddball.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Buchanan, with neither inheritance nor a personal fortune,
uses his popularity as a pugnacious TV pundit. John McCain relies
on his past as a war hero.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, among these and other contenders in the contest for the
Republicans' presidential nomination, surely none has a name quite
as recognizable as Dan Quayle.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Quayle has gained recognition through ridicule.
</P>
<P>
   He was the American vice-president (a heartbeat away from the
position held by the father of George W.) who on a classroom visit
in New Jersey chalked up a misspelled ``potatoe'' in front of the
television cameras; who declared that he ``didn't live in this
century''; who is derisively caricatured in the Doonesbury comic
strip as a feather.
</P>
<P>
   The cruelty of journalism is that no profile of Quayle, not even
by Economist's gentle pundit, Lexington, is complete without a list
of Quayle gaffes.
</P>
<P>
   But does the vice-president (the title may be out-of-date, but
it has its uses) object? Hasn't the press been pretty mean to him?
</P>
<P>
   ``Incredibly mean,'' comes the answer _ but with a sparkle in
the blue eyes and a genuine grin on a sun-burnished face that is 52
years old but remains incongruously boyish.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Quayle is not a man to bear grudges, and, even if he
were, he would be clever enough to hide them. After all,
recognition, however gained, is still an asset: it may just
possibly keep Quayle in the battle for the nomination when other
warriors, their reputations bruised and bank accounts emptied, have
no choice but to leave early. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   BONN _ The timing, though accidental, could hardly be more
striking. Ten years after the collapse of communism, and just as
the government in sleepy little Bonn starts its long trek east to
the old-new capital of Berlin, united Germany is at last starting
to punch its full political weight in the world.
</P>
<P>
   This is partly the work of Gerhard Schroder, a nifty pugilist
(some would say bruiser) of a chancellor.
</P>
<P>
   Partly it is because Germany has this year been both president
of the European Union and chairman of the Group of Seven rich
countries, and has therefore had to show leadership on all sorts of
matters from European budget reform to debt relief for the world's
poorest states.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, though, it is because of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   It is remarkable enough that German forces, with the backing of
most Germans at home, went abroad to fight for the first time since
1945 (they now make up the second-biggest contingent, after the
British, in the Kosovo peace force).
</P>
<P>
   Only a few years ago most Germans still shunned even a
non-combat role for the Bundeswehr in international peacekeeping.
</P>
<P>
   Still more surprising, on the face of it, is that this leap was
made by the country's first government coalition of sometimes
strongly NATO-critical Social Democrats and broadly pacifist
Greens.
</P>
<P>
   But it may have been precisely the switch from a center-right
government to a red-Green one that gave Germany its unexpected
chance to increase its clout abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Had the parties of the left lost September's election, it is
argued, they would almost certainly have damned NATO's bombing of
Serbia, encouraged public opposition to the war and made it far
harder to send Germans into action and keep them there.
</P>
<P>
   As it was, the new coalition under Schroder and his Green
foreign minister, Joschka Fischer, had willy-nilly to take a crash
course in foreign-policy realism. It turned out to be a painful
exercise. Just how painful is emerging bit by bit.
</P>
<P>
   At the start, it is true, the Germans were happily surprised by
American back-slapping and smiles.
</P>
<P>
   During a visit to Washington last October, after their election
victory but nearly three weeks before taking office, Schroder and
Fischer sought _ and thought they had received _ a promise that
they would not be pressed into backing a ``military option'' in
Kosovo, at least until they had been sworn into office.
</P>
<P>
   Three days later, back in Bonn, a surprise call from Washington
demanded that they should give it their support more or less within
the hour.
</P>
<P>
   Why the sudden change? No one in Bonn seems to know for sure.
</P>
<P>
   Subsequently, the Germans had other Kosovo-induced differences
with America _ for instance, over the American bombing of the
Chinese embassy in Belgrade (embarrassingly just before Schroder
was due to visit Beijing) and over how best to handle the Russians.
</P>
<P>
   Still, as Fischer notes, America is ``the only heavyweight''
around. Harder for the Germans to take was their treatment by the
British and French over the Rambouillet conference, which began
work in February to try to find a political solution for Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   German officials who arrived in London in late January to
discuss setting up just such a gathering say they were
``dumbfounded'' to find that their partners had already settled the
matter and decided to appoint themselves co-chairmen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were left on the doorstep,'' says one official, though not
quite accurately, since the Germans did indeed get inside
Rambouillet's hallowed halls, albeit as little more than house
guests.
</P>
<P>
   When the big three flew to Belgrade in a last-ditch bid to avoid
war, Germany got no place aboard the aircraft. ``That won't happen
to us again,'' vows one senior official, glowering over the
Rambouillet debacle.
</P>
<P>
   Sour grapes? In part, no doubt. But it is understandable that a
brand-new red-Green government should have been treated with
circumspection by its partners in such a crisis.
</P>
<P>
   No matter. The coalition's leaders reckon that in Kosovo they
have clearly proved Germany's reliability as an ally. They had to
fight off sturdy opposition in their parties' ranks and they
(especially Fischer) put their jobs on the line.
</P>
<P>
   Now, they want an equal say at the West's top table. Strictly
speaking, Germany has been part of the West's big four since at
least 1979, when Chancellor Helmut Schmidt joined America, Britain
and France for a summit conference in Guadeloupe to discuss how to
counter the Soviet Union's nuclear plans in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   For two decades after that, though, Germany has remained less
equal than the other three _ partly because it was divided until
1990, partly because, under pressure from the left, it balked at an
active role in peacekeeping abroad.
</P>
<P>
   That is now past. This does not have to mean that Germany,
conscious of its muscle and new status, will now seek to go it
alone. On the contrary, Fischer's people chant that Kosovo
underlines the EU's crying need for a common foreign and security
policy.
</P>
<P>
   But Germany demands ``a leading role'' (any ears cocked in Paris
and London?) in formulating that policy. And it will be no less
forceful than its partners in promoting its own people for top
international posts.
</P>
<P>
   Note how Schroder boxed through his right-hand man, Bodo
Hombach, for the big economic-aid job in the Balkans; also how he
has played tough with Romano Prodi, the European commission's new
president, over which two Germans should become commissioners in
Brussels.
</P>
<P>
   Nor may it be coincidence that Germany has decided to boycott
informal EU meetings because Finland, which took over from Germany
at the beginning of this month to hold the Union's six-month
presidency, refuses to include German at them as a working
language.
</P>
<P>
   Is there a danger that Germans may now be forgetting the
grimmest aspects of their past?
</P>
<P>
   No. On June 25, after more than a decade of anguished debate,
the German parliament at last agreed to the building of a huge
memorial to Jewish victims of the Holocaust in the middle of
Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   Still, though Germany is not turning its back on the past, it is
less disposed to be constrained by it.
</P>
<P>
   As Schroder put it on taking office, it is a country ``neither
better nor worse'' than others. Quite so. Just a bit bigger than
its neighbors, and bang in the center of Europe. &QL;

   BONN _ The timing, though accidental, could hardly be more
striking. Ten years after the collapse of communism, and just as
the government in sleepy little Bonn starts its long trek east to
the old-new capital of Berlin, united Germany is at last starting
to punch its full political weight in the world.
</P>
<P>
   This is partly the work of Gerhard Schroder, a nifty pugilist
(some would say bruiser) of a chancellor.
</P>
<P>
   Partly it is because Germany has this year been both president
of the European Union and chairman of the Group of Seven rich
countries, and has therefore had to show leadership on all sorts of
matters from European budget reform to debt relief for the world's
poorest states.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, though, it is because of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   It is remarkable enough that German forces, with the backing of
most Germans at home, went abroad to fight for the first time since
1945 (they now make up the second-biggest contingent, after the
British, in the Kosovo peace force).
</P>
<P>
   Only a few years ago most Germans still shunned even a
non-combat role for the Bundeswehr in international peacekeeping.
</P>
<P>
   Still more surprising, on the face of it, is that this leap was
made by the country's first government coalition of sometimes
strongly NATO-critical Social Democrats and broadly pacifist
Greens.
</P>
<P>
   But it may have been precisely the switch from a center-right
government to a red-Green one that gave Germany its unexpected
chance to increase its clout abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Had the parties of the left lost September's election, it is
argued, they would almost certainly have damned NATO's bombing of
Serbia, encouraged public opposition to the war and made it far
harder to send Germans into action and keep them there.
</P>
<P>
   As it was, the new coalition under Schroder and his Green
foreign minister, Joschka Fischer, had willy-nilly to take a crash
course in foreign-policy realism. It turned out to be a painful
exercise. Just how painful is emerging bit by bit.
</P>
<P>
   At the start, it is true, the Germans were happily surprised by
American back-slapping and smiles.
</P>
<P>
   During a visit to Washington last October, after their election
victory but nearly three weeks before taking office, Schroder and
Fischer sought _ and thought they had received _ a promise that
they would not be pressed into backing a ``military option'' in
Kosovo, at least until they had been sworn into office.
</P>
<P>
   Three days later, back in Bonn, a surprise call from Washington
demanded that they should give it their support more or less within
the hour.
</P>
<P>
   Why the sudden change? No one in Bonn seems to know for sure.
</P>
<P>
   Subsequently, the Germans had other Kosovo-induced differences
with America _ for instance, over the American bombing of the
Chinese embassy in Belgrade (embarrassingly just before Schroder
was due to visit Beijing) and over how best to handle the Russians.
</P>
<P>
   Still, as Fischer notes, America is ``the only heavyweight''
around. Harder for the Germans to take was their treatment by the
British and French over the Rambouillet conference, which began
work in February to try to find a political solution for Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   German officials who arrived in London in late January to
discuss setting up just such a gathering say they were
``dumbfounded'' to find that their partners had already settled the
matter and decided to appoint themselves co-chairmen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were left on the doorstep,'' says one official, though not
quite accurately, since the Germans did indeed get inside
Rambouillet's hallowed halls, albeit as little more than house
guests.
</P>
<P>
   When the big three flew to Belgrade in a last-ditch bid to avoid
war, Germany got no place aboard the aircraft. ``That won't happen
to us again,'' vows one senior official, glowering over the
Rambouillet debacle.
</P>
<P>
   Sour grapes? In part, no doubt. But it is understandable that a
brand-new red-Green government should have been treated with
circumspection by its partners in such a crisis.
</P>
<P>
   No matter. The coalition's leaders reckon that in Kosovo they
have clearly proved Germany's reliability as an ally. They had to
fight off sturdy opposition in their parties' ranks and they
(especially Fischer) put their jobs on the line.
</P>
<P>
   Now, they want an equal say at the West's top table. Strictly
speaking, Germany has been part of the West's big four since at
least 1979, when Chancellor Helmut Schmidt joined America, Britain
and France for a summit conference in Guadeloupe to discuss how to
counter the Soviet Union's nuclear plans in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   For two decades after that, though, Germany has remained less
equal than the other three _ partly because it was divided until
1990, partly because, under pressure from the left, it balked at an
active role in peacekeeping abroad.
</P>
<P>
   That is now past. This does not have to mean that Germany,
conscious of its muscle and new status, will now seek to go it
alone. On the contrary, Fischer's people chant that Kosovo
underlines the EU's crying need for a common foreign and security
policy.
</P>
<P>
   But Germany demands ``a leading role'' (any ears cocked in Paris
and London?) in formulating that policy. And it will be no less
forceful than its partners in promoting its own people for top
international posts.
</P>
<P>
   Note how Schroder boxed through his right-hand man, Bodo
Hombach, for the big economic-aid job in the Balkans; also how he
has played tough with Romano Prodi, the European commission's new
president, over which two Germans should become commissioners in
Brussels.
</P>
<P>
   Nor may it be coincidence that Germany has decided to boycott
informal EU meetings because Finland, which took over from Germany
at the beginning of this month to hold the Union's six-month
presidency, refuses to include German at them as a working
language.
</P>
<P>
   Is there a danger that Germans may now be forgetting the
grimmest aspects of their past?
</P>
<P>
   No. On June 25, after more than a decade of anguished debate,
the German parliament at last agreed to the building of a huge
memorial to Jewish victims of the Holocaust in the middle of
Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   Still, though Germany is not turning its back on the past, it is
less disposed to be constrained by it.
</P>
<P>
   As Schroder put it on taking office, it is a country ``neither
better nor worse'' than others. Quite so. Just a bit bigger than
its neighbors, and bang in the center of Europe. &QL;

   LOS ANGELES: this competition seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have an amazing positive effect on the North
Hollywood community.''
</P>
<P>
   DreamWorks' proposed studio would have been the first motion
picture production studio built in Los Angeles since the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   Glendale City Manager Jim Starbird said he hopes to build on the
relationship the city developed with DreamWorks when it built its
animation shop there three years ago, and will encourage the
company to utilize its entire campus or look at other potential
sites in the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd like to see Glendale be their home if we can meet their
needs,'' Starbird said.
</P>
<P>
   DreamWorks has not yet started construction on what was to be
Phase 2 of its animation complex, which includes a 100,000- to
150,000-square-foot building. Unlike Playa Vista, the animation
complex project was approved quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Quaschnick said DreamWorks could always ask to change its plans
and to build more space.
</P>
<P>
   ``They could develop the site more intensely than they had
planned. Instead of building three stories, they could build four
or five stories.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmdale also is interested, and officials are talking to
developers about the idea of establishing studios, including those
with ties to DreamWorks, said Mayor Jim Ledford.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our philosophy is not to direct them to a particular site. We
let them tell us what sites they are interested in and work with
them to make that happen,'' he said.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Welcome to the home of DreamWorks SKG _ the star
studio and pride of Burbank, or is it Glendale, Palmdale,
Lancaster, Santa Clarita or North Hollywood?
</P>
<P>
   A week after DreamWorks abandoned its plans to build a $250
million studio complex at Playa Vista near the beach, a long line
of communities is trying to woo the glamorous production company
run by Steven Spielberg, Jeffrey Katzenberg and David Geffen.
</P>
<P>
   The company, responsible for ``Saving Private Ryan'' and ``The
Prince of Egypt,'' has yet to show any interest in reviving its
plans for constructing a major studio at a single site. Operations
now are scattered at Glendale, Universal City and Beverly Hills.
</P>
<P>
   Mayors, city managers and development officers from throughout
the San Fernando Valley region _ home to Warner Bros., Disney and
Universal _ hope to become home to Hollywood's newest studio, a
move that would boost tax and tourism revenues, bring good-paying
jobs _ and add star power.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not to champion their bad news, but this is an opportunity,''
said Derrill Quaschnick, assistant director of the Glendale
Redevelopment Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Santa Clarita Mayor Jo Anne Darcy is drafting a letter asking
DreamWorks to consider her city.
</P>
<P>
   Burbank City Manager Robert ``Bud'' Ovrom already has sent not
one but three letters, including aerial photos of the sites he
likes best.
</P>
<P>
   The city of Lancaster is willing to give DreamWorks 47 acres _
free.
</P>
<P>
   And what is DreamWorks doing about all this newfound attention?
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not looking at anything at this point,'' said spokesman
Andy Spahn. ``We've been getting calls, but we hadn't had
discussions with anyone yet.''
</P>
<P>
   That hang-back approach might only fuel the competition among
suitors even though the early forecasts give the edge to Universal
City, where DreamWorks has offices, and Glendale, where its
animation shop is housed.
</P>
<P>
   That won't stop Burbank's Ovrom from pulling out all the stops.
The city's No. 1 promoter has shamelessly attempted to entice other
studios to locate new facilities in Burbank, going so far as taking
out ads in the Hollywood trades.
</P>
<P>
   After their ordeal in Playa Vista, where financing fell through
and environmentalists raised substantial community opposition,
Ovrom said DreamWorks might be ready for a pitch from a
studio-friendly city like Burbank.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every site we'll show them is ready to go. All you have to do
is come over to our counter and pull the building permit,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   While DreamWorks had planned to create a huge complex at Playa
Vista, complete with soundstages and office buildings, Ovrom said
it might make more sense for the company just to build a
``signature'' headquarters building and then to lease soundstage
space from other studios, like Warner Bros. and NBC.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're perfect for that,'' Ovrom said. ``We're ground zero for
the entertainment industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles County Supervisor Michael D. Antonovich weighed in
on behalf of Lancaster's offer of land near Fox Field, writing
letters to Spielberg and Katzenberg.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unlike the city of Los Angeles, Lancaster is business-friendly
and would work to help you locate your studio in its
jurisdiction,'' Antonovich wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Margolis, a spokesman for Mayor Richard Riordan's office of
economic development, said DreamWorks is a priority for Los
Angeles, which had offered more than $70 million in incentives for
the Playa Vista site.
</P>
<P>
   ``As with other potential major developments, the city will
continue to present DreamWorks with other sites. A number of sites
are being considered,'' he said, adding that it was too soon to
consider what types of incentives might be offered to the studio to
locate in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The L.A. site most often talked about is the North Hollywood
Studio Project, where developer J. Allen Radford has been cleared
to build 10 soundstages, two 20-story towers and a business campus.
</P>
<P>
   Radford said his site provides a convenient location for
DreamWorks because it is located near both the company's offices on
the Universal campus and its 12-acre animation complex in Glendale.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always took the position that if they weren't successful in
Playa Vista that we are a viable alternative within the city of Los
Angeles,'' Radford said.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Allen, president of the Economic Alliance of San Fernando
Valley, said Los Angeles needs to be aggressive to win the project.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Los Angeles should be scrambling to keep this deal
because they have a good chance of losing it to Glendale and
Burbank. It could be embarrassing for L.A. to lose this deal,''
Allen said. ``L.A. needs to take this competition seriously.''

<P>
   The U.N.'s secretary-general said he was looking for someone
``with a political sense, a leader and manager, who is also a good
negotiator'' to be the civilian proconsul for the new protectorate
of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Those are certainly not the qualities usually associated with
Bernard Kouchner, France's junior health minister, whom Kofi Annan
has picked for the job.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Kouchner, however, has always been full of talents _ and
surprises. Under his direction, the administration of Kosovo will
certainly be neither dull nor lacking in idealistic spirit. Whether
it will be effective is another matter.
</P>
<P>
   Impulsive, provocative, frenetically energetic, teeming with
ideas, articulate, generous and courageous, Dr. Kouchner is also
blunt, abrasive, impatient, disorganized, opinionated and
quick-tempered.
</P>
<P>
   Now nearly 60, he still cultivates the cavalier manner of the
1960s rebel he once was. Many have found him hard to work with,
poor at delegating and short on political nous. He failed abysmally
both times he stood for a seat in France's National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   He can appear vain and media-obsessed. Still, whatever the
carpers say, he is regularly judged France's most popular
politician.
</P>
<P>
   More to the point as far as Kosovo goes, he knows the
international aid scene backwards. And for all the chaos he creates
around him, he has a knack of getting things done.
</P>
<P>
   It was he, in 1971, who blazed a trail in the provision of
humanitarian aid when he jointly founded Medecins sans Frontieres,
an organization that got volunteer doctors, most of them French, to
help people devastated by war and disaster in the most remote and
bloody parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
   As a young gastroenterologist, he had gone with the
International Committee of the Red Cross to treat victims of
Nigeria's civil war. Appalled by what he saw, he determined on his
return to break the Red Cross volunteers' vow of silence that was
often the price paid to nasty governments to let them operate.
</P>
<P>
   If atrocities were to be stopped, it was as important to
dispense information as medicine, he insisted. So Medecins sans
Frontieres's aims were ``temoigner et soigner'' _ to ``bear
witness'' as well as to ``care for'' the sick and wounded.
</P>
<P>
   After nearly three decades of brave action by the ``French
doctors,'' as they are often simply known, it is easy to forget
that it was only in 1988 that the U.N.'s General Assembly resolved
to give neutral organizations a right to ``free access to the
victims of natural catastrophes.'' And only in 1990 did it bless
the idea of ``emergency humanitarian corridors.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Kouchner was the driving force behind both resolutions. And
he helped push through another, in the Security Council, after the
Gulf war, calling on Iraq to give international humanitarian groups
``immediate access to all those in need.''
</P>
<P>
   He saw the ensuing joint relief operation by France, Britain and
the United States in the Kurdish part of Iraq as a crucial step
towards the acceptance of an even more ambitious and controversial
notion for which he had long campaigned: where disasters are
imminent, there must be a universally accepted droit d'ingerence,
variously translated as a right of ``intervention'' or of
``interference.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Kouchner reckons the phrase embraces a bit of both. He
proudly quotes what Nelson Mandela once told him: ``Thank you for
interfering in things that do not concern you.''
</P>
<P>
   With the aim of preventing mass suffering before it happens, he
also envisaged the creation under U.N. auspices of a multinational
``army without frontiers,'' empowered to intervene without the host
government's approval whenever a people was in imminent danger of
famine, civil war, or suchlike.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo, he reckons, has prompted another stride towards
achieving that goal.
</P>
<P>
   Born of a Jewish father just after the Second World War began,
Dr. Kouchner dreams of a world where another Holocaust could never
happen.
</P>
<P>
   But his critics say his zeal for a droit d'ingerence (or, as he
prefers it, an obligation d'ingerence) is just another means to
slake his thirst for publicity: witness the film of him, back in
1992, as France's minister for health and humanitarian affairs,
lugging a sack of rice for starving Somalis up a beach.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Kouchner would not deny that he plays to the gallery; nor is
it his fault that he is handsome and dashing; nor that his wife,
Christine Ockrent, is a famously glamorous former TV newscaster,
now magazine editor. He would argue simply that he needs the media
to help him do good.
</P>
<P>
   Handling Kosovo _ and the news about it _ is so far proving
easier for soldiers than for civilians. The lessons of Bosnia,
where buck-passing between the two groups often degenerated into
ugly transatlantic squabbles, are already being recalled.
</P>
<P>
   British, French and Swedish peacemakers in Bosnia ground their
teeth as politicians in Washington praised the American-led
soldiers policing Bosnia's internal partition lines _ contrasting
them with supposedly slothful European bureaucrats building a new
country where such lines were no longer meant to matter.
</P>
<P>
   In Kosovo, too, the peacekeepers in uniform are getting going
far faster than the U.N.'s dawdling civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly five weeks after western forces marched in, their
commander _ General Sir Mike Jackson, a British paratrooper _ is
the only person exercising any real authority on behalf of the
outside world.
</P>
<P>
   What about the 3,000 policemen the U.N. is supposed to run? So
far, less than 100 have arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Kouchner, who has already (rightly) trashed the idea that
the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) should serve as the core of a new
police force, will soon be chafing at the bit.
</P>
<P>
   Once he gets his various people in place, he will have to
coordinate the work of umpteen other agencies _ the EU, the World
Bank, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, the
democracy-builders of the Organization for Security and Cooperation
in Europe _ in building a brave new province, while General Jackson
does his best to put the KLA under control.
</P>
<P>
   On the face of things, Dr. Bernard and General Mike look an odd
pair. But the success of Kosovo's rehabilitation will depend
largely on how they get along _ and how dexterously the doctor
manages a myriad of competing civilian agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Keep your fingers crossed. &QL;

 By W.H. STICKNEY JR.  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ For the long-suffering Sacramento Monarchs,
respect has been hard to come by.
<TEXT>
<P>
   That should no longer be a problem, after the way they took
apart the Comets 74-63 on Thursday night at Arco Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Kedra Holland-Corn, a Houston native, had six steals to key a
stifling defense that held Cynthia Cooper and Sheryl Swoopes in
check. The Comets (11-2) shot a season-low 32.8 percent from the
field.
</P>
<P>
   ``You shoot 32 percent, you're not going to beat a good
basketball team that played well,'' said Comets coach Van
Chancellor. ``And (Monarchs coach Sonny Allen) said he thought that
was as well as they could play. They had a great plan; they
deserved it. They really executed well.''
</P>
<P>
   During the offseason, Chancellor thought about drafting
Holland-Corn but changed his mind. Thursday night, she got under
the Comets' skin with 16 points and six steals.
</P>
<P>
   But she also threw a net over Cooper, holding her to a single
field goal and four points through the first 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the first time we've ever played for 40 minutes solid,
and tonight we just focused on Cooper, Swoopes and (Tina) Thompson
and tried to mess their game up a little bit,'' Holland-Corn said.
``I thought we got in Cooper's head and got in Swoopes' head just a
little bit, but Thompson wasn't affected in the beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson scored 10 of her 17 points in the first half. But
Cooper didn't reach double figures until midway through the second
half and Swoopes was sporadic throughout as she tried to counter
the defense of Ruthie Bolton-Holifield.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, we had to shut them down defensively, and our kids just
did a great effort,'' said Allen, in his first year as Monarchs
coach. ``That's probably the best defensive game the Monarchs have
ever played for 40 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been getting respect, but you have to earn it. You have
to beat good teams, and this is the first real good team we've
beaten this year. I'm not worried about respect, if we keep playing
well. That'll come.''
</P>
<P>
   Though defense was the name of the Monarchs' game, offensive
rebounds and the perimeter shooting of Bolton-Holifield were
contributing factors for Sacramento (9-4).
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you see Cynthia Cooper making the moves tonight?''
Monarchs point guard Ticha Penicheiro playfully asked the crowd of
9,505 afterward. ``I don't think so.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the game we wanted to see where we are. We won, but we
still have a ways to go.''
</P>
<P>
   The Monarchs are at the top of the WNBA class this season in
offensive rebounding. Thursday night, they worked over the Comets
for 16 offensive rebounds (35 total) and used that advantage to
help score 34 points in the paint compared to 12 for the Comets.
</P>
<P>
   Yolanda Griffith pulled down a game-high 13 rebounds (four
offensive) to go with 15 points, and Latasha Byears had 10 rebounds
(six offensive).
</P>
<P>
   After spotting the Comets a 3-0 lead, thanks to a 3-pointer by
Swoopes, the Monarchs took the lead for good on a fast-break layup
by Penicheiro, one of Sacramento's three All-Stars, at 16:25 of the
opening period.
</P>
<P>
   The Comets trailed 37-32 at the half. Cooper was 0-for-5 from
the field and had only four points, and the Comets had shot a
dismal 29.4 percent from the field.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, the first few minutes of the second half are a time for
the Comets to regroup, adjust and come out firing.
</P>
<P>
   It was not to be Thursday. Instead, the futility of the opening
20 minutes only worsened. The dismal shooting continued with
Holland-Corn harassing Cooper and Bolton-Holifield making life
miserable for Swoopes.
</P>
<P>
   And when Thompson picked up her fourth foul with 13:19 to play,
it gave Griffith a chance to make one of two free throws and put
the Comets in a 12-point hole (51-39), matching their largest
deficit this season.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper finally got her second field goal of the night and first
3-pointer with 8:04 to go, but it served only to rescue the Comets
from a 56-43 deficit. Griffith's offensive rebound and basket gave
Sacramento a commanding 60-46 lead a minute later.
</P>
<P>
   A 6-0 run by the Comets with Sonja Henning and Thompson getting
back-to-back buckets and Swoopes hitting a pair of free throws cut
the margin to 60-52.
</P>
<P>
   But the rally was short-lived. A basket by Bolton-Holifield with
5:06 left boosted the lead to 62-52.
</P>
<P>
   A pair of free throws by Penicheiro made it 74-60 with 32.1
seconds left. Thompson's 3-pointer with 14.1 seconds to go provided
the final margin.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper finished with 13 points, her third straight game reaching
that figure, which is 10 points below her average, and Swoopes
added 14.

<P>
   The U.N.'s secretary-general said he was looking for someone
``with a political sense, a leader and manager, who is also a good
negotiator'' to be the civilian proconsul for the new protectorate
of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Those are certainly not the qualities usually associated with
Bernard Kouchner, France's junior health minister, whom Kofi Annan
has picked for the job.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Kouchner, however, has always been full of talents _ and
surprises. Under his direction, the administration of Kosovo will
certainly be neither dull nor lacking in idealistic spirit. Whether
it will be effective is another matter.
</P>
<P>
   Impulsive, provocative, frenetically energetic, teeming with
ideas, articulate, generous and courageous, Dr. Kouchner is also
blunt, abrasive, impatient, disorganized, opinionated and
quick-tempered.
</P>
<P>
   Now nearly 60, he still cultivates the cavalier manner of the
1960s rebel he once was. Many have found him hard to work with,
poor at delegating and short on political nous. He failed abysmally
both times he stood for a seat in France's National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   He can appear vain and media-obsessed. Still, whatever the
carpers say, he is regularly judged France's most popular
politician.
</P>
<P>
   More to the point as far as Kosovo goes, he knows the
international aid scene backwards. And for all the chaos he creates
around him, he has a knack of getting things done.
</P>
<P>
   It was he, in 1971, who blazed a trail in the provision of
humanitarian aid when he jointly founded Medecins sans Frontieres,
an organization that got volunteer doctors, most of them French, to
help people devastated by war and disaster in the most remote and
bloody parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
   As a young gastroenterologist, he had gone with the
International Committee of the Red Cross to treat victims of
Nigeria's civil war. Appalled by what he saw, he determined on his
return to break the Red Cross volunteers' vow of silence that was
often the price paid to nasty governments to let them operate.
</P>
<P>
   If atrocities were to be stopped, it was as important to
dispense information as medicine, he insisted. So Medecins sans
Frontieres's aims were ``temoigner et soigner'' _ to ``bear
witness'' as well as to ``care for'' the sick and wounded.
</P>
<P>
   After nearly three decades of brave action by the ``French
doctors,'' as they are often simply known, it is easy to forget
that it was only in 1988 that the U.N.'s General Assembly resolved
to give neutral organizations a right to ``free access to the
victims of natural catastrophes.'' And only in 1990 did it bless
the idea of ``emergency humanitarian corridors.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Kouchner was the driving force behind both resolutions. And
he helped push through another, in the Security Council, after the
Gulf war, calling on Iraq to give international humanitarian groups
``immediate access to all those in need.''
</P>
<P>
   He saw the ensuing joint relief operation by France, Britain and
the United States in the Kurdish part of Iraq as a crucial step
towards the acceptance of an even more ambitious and controversial
notion for which he had long campaigned: where disasters are
imminent, there must be a universally accepted droit d'ingerence,
variously translated as a right of ``intervention'' or of
``interference.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Kouchner reckons the phrase embraces a bit of both. He
proudly quotes what Nelson Mandela once told him: ``Thank you for
interfering in things that do not concern you.''
</P>
<P>
   With the aim of preventing mass suffering before it happens, he
also envisaged the creation under U.N. auspices of a multinational
``army without frontiers,'' empowered to intervene without the host
government's approval whenever a people was in imminent danger of
famine, civil war, or suchlike.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovo, he reckons, has prompted another stride towards
achieving that goal.
</P>
<P>
   Born of a Jewish father just after the Second World War began,
Dr. Kouchner dreams of a world where another Holocaust could never
happen.
</P>
<P>
   But his critics say his zeal for a droit d'ingerence (or, as he
prefers it, an obligation d'ingerence) is just another means to
slake his thirst for publicity: witness the film of him, back in
1992, as France's minister for health and humanitarian affairs,
lugging a sack of rice for starving Somalis up a beach.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Kouchner would not deny that he plays to the gallery; nor is
it his fault that he is handsome and dashing; nor that his wife,
Christine Ockrent, is a famously glamorous former TV newscaster,
now magazine editor. He would argue simply that he needs the media
to help him do good.
</P>
<P>
   Handling Kosovo _ and the news about it _ is so far proving
easier for soldiers than for civilians. The lessons of Bosnia,
where buck-passing between the two groups often degenerated into
ugly transatlantic squabbles, are already being recalled.
</P>
<P>
   British, French and Swedish peacemakers in Bosnia ground their
teeth as politicians in Washington praised the American-led
soldiers policing Bosnia's internal partition lines _ contrasting
them with supposedly slothful European bureaucrats building a new
country where such lines were no longer meant to matter.
</P>
<P>
   In Kosovo, too, the peacekeepers in uniform are getting going
far faster than the U.N.'s dawdling civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly five weeks after western forces marched in, their
commander _ General Sir Mike Jackson, a British paratrooper _ is
the only person exercising any real authority on behalf of the
outside world.
</P>
<P>
   What about the 3,000 policemen the U.N. is supposed to run? So
far, less than 100 have arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Kouchner, who has already (rightly) trashed the idea that
the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) should serve as the core of a new
police force, will soon be chafing at the bit.
</P>
<P>
   Once he gets his various people in place, he will have to
coordinate the work of umpteen other agencies _ the EU, the World
Bank, the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, the
democracy-builders of the Organization for Security and Cooperation
in Europe _ in building a brave new province, while General Jackson
does his best to put the KLA under control.
</P>
<P>
   On the face of things, Dr. Bernard and General Mike look an odd
pair. But the success of Kosovo's rehabilitation will depend
largely on how they get along _ and how dexterously the doctor
manages a myriad of competing civilian agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Keep your fingers crossed. &QL;

UCLA FOOTBALL PLAYERS CHARGED WITH OBTAINING HANDICAPPED PLACARDS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY PHILLIP W. BROWNE   AND JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Tripped up by a sharp-eyed police officer, 14
current and former UCLA football players were criminally charged
Thursday with falsely claiming physical disabilities to get
handicapped parking placards.
</P>
<P>
   The players used the placards to park in handicapped-only spots
on and off campus and to avoid paying the $225 per-semester parking
fees, according to Deputy City Attorney Brian Williams.
</P>
<P>
   The scheme began to unravel when a school police officer noticed
a placard was misplaced on a car and questioned the driver, leading
him to football players, according to prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   The players, including five from the San Fernando Valley area,
face up to six months in jail and $1,000 fines each if convicted of
the misdemeanor charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am embarrassed and disappointed for the young men who were
involved in this problem,'' head football coach Bob Toledo said in
the statement released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have spoken to the team as a whole and to the individuals
involved, and those individuals will be disciplined by me. This is
not how I expect players in my program to act _ that has been made
very clear to these young men.''
</P>
<P>
   With the season set to begin Sept. 4, the charges rocked team
members, who held an informal practice Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Toledo was very, very angry,'' said one player who asked not
to be identified. ``The penalties are going to be severe. He talked
about how bad we would feel if we knew people who were
handicapped.''
</P>
<P>
   Athletic Director Peter Dalis said the Athletics Department has
cooperated fully with the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly do not condone the actions of the individuals
involved,'' Dalis said in a statement. ``No one in the Athletic
Department was aware of the situation until it was brought to our
attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for the handicapped said the misuse of placards is
outrageous.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very frustrating when you're driving around and all the
handicapped spots are taken,'' said Rose Farzaneh, director of
Farzaneh Social Services. ``If you sit and watch, many people come
back to their cars and they are not disabled after all. We don't
like this kind of thing.''
</P>
<P>
   UCLA sports spokesman Steve Rourke said team members have known
for a few weeks that they might be charged.
</P>
<P>
   ``But right now they are only accused. Let's not convict them
yet,'' Rourke said.
</P>
<P>
   The National Collegiate Athletic Association does not have
jurisdiction over athletes involved in criminal charges. Rather,
the organization leaves penalties up to the schools.
</P>
<P>
   Department of Motor Vehicles officials said UCLA has been the
source of frequent complaints about handicapped parking violations
and the target for undercover investigations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've done stings at UCLA before. A lot of complaints come
from there,'' said Evan Nossoff, a DMV spokesman. ``Illegally
taking a handicapped space is right up there with stealing a blind
man's cane.''
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, the DMV ran a sting at a Beverly Hills restaurant
where valets were stealing placards and either selling them or
using them for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``They got a lot of heat for that,'' Nossoff said. ``Almost
everyone wants preferential parking in Los Angeles.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said the UCLA scheme involved players listing false
ailments and disabilities on applications for the placards. They
also are accused of signing the names of physicians who do not
exist and then submitting the applications to the DMV, Williams
alleged.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation, initiated by UCLA police, began Jan. 16 when
a patrolman spotted a car in the Sunset Village parking structure
on De Neve Drive with a placard improperly placed on the rear-view
mirror.
</P>
<P>
   The officer questioned the driver, who said he was visiting
Robert Wayne Thomas and had borrowed the placard from him, said
City Attorney spokesman Mike Qualls.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA detectives questioned Thomas, then teammate Abdul Azziz,
and got copies of their DMV applications for the placards.
</P>
<P>
   Those applications reportedly contained false information about
physical handicaps, the signature of a nonexistent doctor, a fake
medical license number and an address at the Los Angeles Medical
Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that point, suspicion grew that other players might have
done the same thing,'' Qualls said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators then used DMV records to eventually match the
names of 12 other team members with current or recently expired
handicapped placards, Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the players, 21-year-old Deatra Clinton of West Covina,
obtained two placards and faces two misdemeanor counts of illegally
obtaining a placard and giving false information to the DMV.
</P>
<P>
   (CONTINUED ON NEXT TAKE)
</P>
<P>
   X X X
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES: information to the DMV.
</P>
<P>
   The other 13 players are charged with one misdemeanor count each
of illegally possessing a handicapped placard and giving false
information to the DMV.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Clinton, the accused athletes are Azziz, 22, of Sherman
Oaks; Thomas, 18, of Imperial; Damian Dominic Allen, 21, of Van
Nuys; Marques Deon Anderson, 20, of Long Beach; Oscar Cabrera, 21,
of Highland Park; James Michael Ghezzi, 22, of Mar Vista; Duval
Jerome Hicks, 23, of Sherman Oaks; Ryan Clint Nece, 20, of Palms;
Durell Rayton Price, 21, of Newhall; Mark Reynosa, 20, of Sylmar;
Ryan Jason Roques, 21, of Mar Vista; Craig Hilary Walendy, 21, of
Westlake; and Anthony Dewayne White, 20, of Sherman Oaks.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was a nonscholarship player in 1996, and Allen did not
play last year, Rourke said. Hicks, Reynosa and Walendy played last
year when they were seniors.
</P>
<P>
   When the season starts, Anderson, Roques, Price, Nece, Ghezzi,
Azziz, White and Thomas are candidates to start, and the rest would
be reserves.
</P>
<P>
   The players are scheduled to be arraigned July 28 in Los Angeles
Municipal Court.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA police detectives investigated the case and turned their
findings over to the city attorney's Special Enforcement Unit.

occupied by 600,000 troops of democratic India. Commentary by

   &UR; SPORTS (Moved in ``s'' category) &LR;

<P>
   BBO-ANDERSON-COLUMN (New York) _ If you were thinking about
going to see the Yankees and the Mets at Shea Stadium Friday night,
Saturday afternoon or Sunday afternoon, you'd better have a ticket
by now. If not, fuhgeddaboutit. All three games are sold out.
That's the bottom-line rebuttal to anyone who wondered, as both Joe
Torre and Bobby Valentine did for different reasons, if this
season's six Met-Yankee games, up from three in each of the
previous two seasons, were three too many. By Dave Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   SOC-WOMEN-HAMM (Los Angeles) _ As much as Mia Hamm continues to
protest, ``This World Cup is not about me,'' the more it becomes
apparent that, yes, it is about her. She is the name and face that
everyone knows. It is her jersey that the little girls wear. It is
her lack of scoring in the last three games that has everyone
wondering whether the Americans are capable of beating the surging
Chinese on Saturday in the World Cup final before 90,000 fans at
the Rose Bowl. By Jere Longman.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ENTERTAINMENT (Moved in ``e'' category) &LR;
</P>
<P>
   NAZI-ART-AUCTION (London) _ Sales records were broken one after
another for Old Master paintings, medieval manuscripts and antiques
of every variety here at Christie's on Thursday as more than
three-and-a-half hours of feverish bidding erupted over a trove of
treasures looted by the Nazis and returned to the Rothschild family
this year by the Austrian government. By Carol Vogel.
</P>
<P>
   PEONY-OPERA-REVIEW (New York) _ The peony is a hardy flower. Its
theatrical counterpart has survived 400 years in China and now a
trip across the Pacific. It has been thwarted by bureaucrats at
home, shortened and modernized abroad. Now, as ``The Peony
Pavilion,'' it faces another test: maximization. Placed at the
center of Lincoln Center Festival '99, Tang Xianzu's wandering epic
of love, death and the supernatural is testing the endurance of
both its players and its audience: 6 episodes, 20 hours, the cycle
to be repeated three times this month. By Bernard Holland. With

   Astros tumble to D-Backs in 11th
</P>
<P>
   Late attack not enough in 8-7 loss
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By CARLTON THOMPSON &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
PHOENIX _ Extra-inning games are a battle of the bullpens, and
that's usually bad news for the Arizona Diamondbacks, who have
blown 15 save opportunities this season.
</P>
<P>
   But on Thursday they were outdone by the Astros' relievers, who
surrendered two extra-inning leads en route to a demoralizing 8-7
loss at Bank One Ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Williams' 11th-inning RBI single off Brian Williams put the
Astros out of their misery four hours and 16 minutes after the
first pitch. It also wiped out a huge performance by Derek Bell,
who twice delivered clutch hits in the late innings.
</P>
<P>
   Bell's two-out single to center chased home Craig Biggio with
what might have been the winning run in the top of the 11th.
</P>
<P>
   Biggio keyed that rally with a hustling, two-out double off
embattled reliever Gregg Olson. Biggio's line drive to left had
single written all over it when it left the bat, but Biggio never
slowed down as he rounded first and dived into second base.
</P>
<P>
   It was one of many big hits for the Astros on a night that began
miserably for the offense and ended terribly for the bullpen. The
Astros scored in each of the last six innings, tying the game with
two outs in the ninth and taking one-run leads in the 10th and
11th.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros had two hits through the first five innings, and they
stranded runners in scoring position with less than two outs in the
sixth, seventh and eighth innings. But their hit-or-miss attack
turned dangerously efficient in the late innings, when they had
their way with the Diamondbacks' bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   After Bell's two-out double in the ninth tied the game, capping
a rally from deficits of 3-0 and 5-2, Carl Everett led off the 10th
inning with a triple to right field and scored on Bill Spiers'
sacrifice fly for a 6-5 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks also had their moments in extra innings,
scoring off Astros closer Billy Wagner on Damian Miller's two-out
RBI double in the bottom of the 10th.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first run Wagner had allowed since May 20 _ a string
of 20 scoreless innings.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Elarton was allowed a more liberal pitch count in his
second start of the season, but he didn't last any longer than in
his previous four-inning stint. The Diamondbacks managed three runs
in four innings against Elarton, who surrendered seven hits.
</P>
<P>
   Elarton had good movement on his fastball, as evidenced by his
five strikeouts, but he didn't have the command he regularly
displayed as a reliever. The Diamondbacks put runners on base in
each of Elarton's four innings and scored in the third on Matt
Williams' two-out double to center field.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks loaded the bases with two walks and single to
lead off the fourth, and the damage was done by a familiar foe. Jay
Bell, who was 9-for-14 with four RBIs in the three-game series,
drove home a pair of runs with his fifth double of the series.
</P>
<P>
   It was Jay Bell's double in the 11th that tied the game and set
the stage for Matt Williams' game-winner.
</P>
<P>
   Elarton, who was scheduled to throw between 75 and 80 pitches,
finished the fourth inning at 87 pitches and surrendered the mound
to reliever Joe Slusarski with the Astros trailing by three runs.
Elarton has a 5.63 ERA in two starts after 27 consecutive relief
outings to start the season.
</P>
<P>
   Diamondbacks starter Armando Reynoso retired 15 of the first 18
batters he faced and worked around leadoff doubles in the first and
second before the Astros finally broke through in the sixth on
Biggio's eighth home run _ a solo shot to left field. Biggio is
hitting .325 over his last 33 games, raising his season average
from .267 to .289 during that stretch.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Bell followed Biggio's home run with a double off the top
of the left-field fence, but was stranded at second base after Jeff
Bagwell and Everett grounded out to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros scored a run, but couldn't force a tie in a
close-but-no-cigar kind of seventh inning. After Spiers reached on
a walk, Richard Hidalgo hit two balls into the left field seats
that were within inches of being game-tying home runs. Instead,
Hidalgo settled for a broken-bat RBI single.
</P>
<P>
   Diamondbacks right fielder Tony Womack stole a hit _ and
possibly an RBI _ away from Ricky Gutierrez with a diving catch of
looping liner. After relief pitcher Greg Swindell walked pinch
hitter Tim Bogar to give the Astros runners at first and second
with two out, rookie Byung-Hyun Kim got Biggio to foul out to end
the inning.

INTERNET REVOLUTION MISSES BLACKS, LATINOS
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By RAMON G. MCLEOD 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  Whites and Asian Americans are at least twice as likely as
blacks and Latinos to have access to the Internet, a racial
``digital divide`` that the federal government is beginning to see
as a civil rights issue.
<P>
   In a strongly worded report released Thursday by the Commerce
Department, people who live in rural areas also were identified as
among groups lagging in access to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``These findings are meaningful because the Internet itself is
meaningful. It is no longer simply a technological marvel. It is
having a very significant impact on people's lives. The way things
are now, you can forget higher-paying jobs if you don't know how to
use it, and you can't use it if you don't have access,'' said Kelly
Levy, director of the domestic policy office for the National
Telecommunications and Information Administration, a Commerce
Department agency.
</P>
<P>
   The report, titled ``Falling Through the Net,'' showed Web use
growing in all parts of U.S. society, but growth was far less among
blacks, Latinos, the poor and rural groups.
</P>
<P>
   Produced by a survey of 48,000 households, the study found that
fully 40 percent had a computer of some kind and that about
one-quarter had Internet access at home.
</P>
<P>
   But the details of the survey found great differences by race,
income and location.
</P>
<P>
   About 30 percent of white households had home access to the
Internet as did about 26 percent of Asian American households. On
the other hand, only about 12 percent of black households had home
access. Similarly, only about 13 percent of Latino households had
home access.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers rise when other access points _ work, schools,
libraries and the like _ are counted, but the division remains very
large.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if they had access to the Internet ``anywhere,''the
government survey found that 37 percent of whites and 35 percent of
Asians said they had some kind of access. Among African Americans,
only about 19 percent answered that they had access; only 16
percent of Latinos said they could get on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Money and location matter too, the study showed. About 60
percent of households with income over $75,000 had home Internet
access. Rural households were less likely to have access at every
income level when compared with their urban counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many Americans are being left behind,'' said Larry Irving, the
Commerce Department assistant secretary for communications and
information, at a Washington news conference to release the
108-page report.

   ``It is now one of America's leading economic and civil rights
issues,'' Irving said.
</P>
<P>
   Levy said that lack of access lowers opportunity to find jobs,
gain training for a better career and, increasingly, to find
valuable information.
</P>
<P>
   Socioeconomics and the cost of owning a computer are a
significant reason why there is a ``digital divide,'' she said.
Although prices have dropped, computers are still relatively
expensive, and monthly connection costs can be beyond the budget of
moderate-income and poor families.
</P>
<P>
   ``But community access, providing machines in public spaces like
libraries, can significantly improve the situation,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Levy said that there is plenty of evidence now that when
computers are available in public locations, especially libraries
and community centers, people who cannot afford them at home use
them heavily _ and not for casual surfing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clear that people use computers in these settings to find
out about jobs, career development and to do basic research,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   The report, confirming private industry studies, showed that
Internet access among whites jumped from 1 in 5 households to
nearly 1 in 3 households from 1997 to 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In the same period, Internet access among black households grew
from 7.7 percent to 11.7 percent, and among Latino households from
8.7 to 12.9 percent. Growth data for Asian American households was
not included in the report.

 &HT;    SENATE OPENING BATTLE OVER 'PATIENTS' BILL OF RIGHTS'
 &HT;    550&AMP;add. With MANAGED-DATA. For release Sunday, July 11.
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With control over the delivery of medical care at
stake, Congress this week takes up legislation aimed at curtailing
the power of the health insurance industry and managed care plans.
</P>
<P>
   The battle over a ``patients' bill of rights'' pits some of the
most influential special interest groups against each another, and
both political parties are mindful of how the issue could play in
the 2000 elections.
</P>
<P>
   On one side are doctors and consumers. They want to see the
managed care industry reined in, with doctors gaining more control
over treating patients and patients gaining more access to care.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side are insurers, health maintenance
organizations, and business interests. The insurers and HMOs worry
they'll lose control of managed care, causing medical costs to
rise.
</P>
<P>
   Business groups worry that more federal regulation will increase
premiums and mean more Americans without health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   When debate starts this week in the Senate, the biggest fights
are likely to be over:
</P>
<P>
   _ Who is covered by the bill.
</P>
<P>
   _ Whether it will guarantee access to physicians outside of
managed care plans.
</P>
<P>
   _ To what extent patients will be able to appeal decisions
regarding their coverage, such as whether to pay for a specific
procedure or whether to be treated in or out of a hospital.
</P>
<P>
   _ Whether patients will be able to sue if such decisions result
in injury or death.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican position, basically, is to limit the number of
people covered by the bill, curb the use of physicians outside of
managed care organizations, make it difficult for patients to
appeal if they're denied coverage or specific treatments, and
prohibit patients from suing over medical decisions _ whether those
decisions are made by an insurance company, an HMO or a business
which is self-insured.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic position is just the opposite: broaden the bill
to include all 160 million people covered by private insurance;
give patients and doctors wide latitude over medical treatment; and
allow patients to sue if a coverage decision causes harm.
</P>
<P>
   Politically, Democrats see themselves as benefitting most from
the issue. With polls showing public unease with HMOs, Democrats
have given passage of a patients' bill of rights top priority.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have sought to avoid a showdown. One reason is that
they know whatever position they take will offend at least one of
their usual constituencies: doctors, insurers or the business
community.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate, the first chamber to take up the issue, plans a
final vote on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, the battleground was expected to be a series of
Democratic amendments aimed at strengthening a Republican bill
adopted on a party-line vote in March by the Senate Health,
Education and Labor Committee.
</P>
<P>
   But in a surprise move, GOP leaders decided last week to use a
Democratic bill as a starting point, with the final amendment being
offered by the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   That means the Senate could adopt all of the Democratic
provisions early in the week, and then sweep them away by adopting
the weaker GOP version of the bill as a final substitute amendment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's that final vote that counts,'' said Dr. Nancy W. Dickey,
immediate past president of the American Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   The AMA last week launched a $200,000-plus advertising and
lobbying campaign targeting key senators.
</P>
<P>
   Substituting the GOP version of the bill for the stronger bill
``falls short'' of what the doctors' want, Dickey said. ``We would
not consider that an acceptable bill.''
</P>
<P>
   Privately, AMA officials said they are concerned that the GOP
tactic may confuse the public by allowing senators to vote for
popular patient protections, but then tell their constituents that
those provisions just weren't included in the final bill.
</P>
<P>
   Insurers, who also have a series of targeted ads circulating the
country, are mounting their strongest effort to defeat legislation
since they defeated President Clinton's health reform proposal in
1994.
</P>
<P>
   Their message is that the Democratic bill is another
big-government power play whose winners would be bureaucrats and
trial lawyers. The losers, they say, would be businesses and
workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``These so-called 'patients rights' would add new federal
government regulations costing billions of dollars that would be
passed on to families and businesses who simply can't afford it,''
said David Lack, president of the Council for Affordable Health
Insurance, an insurance industry group.
</P>
<P>
   Chip Kahn, president of the Health Insurance Association of
America, pointed to an April study by the Congressional Budget
Office that predicted that the Democratic bill would increase
insurance premiums about 6.1 percent when fully implemented.
</P>
<P>
   Each percentage point increase could mean another 200,000
Americans would be uninsured, the CBO estimated.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of what happens in the Senate, the House also is
gearing up for a battle over a patients' bill of rights. The
political landscape there is even more complicated, because three
sets of bills are competing.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican leadership is backing a series of eight bills,
which together resemble the GOP Senate version, that have passed a
labor subcommittee. But competition for GOP support is coming from
a tougher bipartisan proposal sponsored by Rep. Charles Norwood, a
Georgia Republican. A key provision of the Norwood bill would be
the right of patients to sue insurers over treatment decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a Democratic alternative _ a companion to the
Democratic Senate version _ has been offered by Rep. John Dingell
of Michigan, the ranking Democrat on the House Commerce Committee.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., has indicated he hopes the
House will consider a bill before the August recess.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Here are some of the major areas of disagreement
between Democrats and Republicans regarding the ``patients' bill of
rights'' being voted on this week in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   WHO IS COVERED?
</P>
<P>
   The Republican bill limits coverage to about 48 million people
in self-funded employer-sponsored health plans. It would not cover
most people in managed care plans such as health maintenance
organizations. The Democratic bill would cover about 160 million
people, virtually everyone covered by a private health insurance or
managed care plan.
</P>
<P>
   HOW ARE APPEALS HANDLED?
</P>
<P>
   Republicans allow limited external reviews in cases alleging
that treatment was denied even though it was considered a medical
necessity. However, the definition of ``medical necessity'' would
be determined by the insurance plan. Reviews could take up to 65
days. Democrats want a broader external review by an independent
panel that would be required to report in a few days depending on
the severity of the case.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT ABOUT SUING FOR DAMAGES?
</P>
<P>
   Senate Republicans have fought against allowing patients to sue
their insurer or HMO for decisions that cause medical injury.
Democrats view such damage liability as one of the key provisions
in their bill.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT ABOUT ACCESS TO SPECIALISTS?
</P>
<P>
   The Republican plan would allow limited access to specialists
who are not in a managed care plan if patients pay an extra fee and
get approval from the plan each time. Denials could not be
appealed. The Democratic bill would allow patients with specialty
care needs direct access to specialists after an initial referral
from the plan. It would allow referral denials to be appealed to an
independent reviewer.

 &HT;    Suit seeks Southwestern Bell refunds
 &HT;    By Bruce Hight
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Southwestern Bell Telephone Co. allegedly owes
its customers millions of dollars in refunds because since 1991 it
improperly collected a surcharge on monthly bills to pay its
municipal franchise fees, according to a Cameron County lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Southwestern Bell spokesman Bill Maddox said, ``We strongly deny
the allegations in this case, and, since it is continuing
litigation, that should be the extent of our comment at this
time.''
</P>
<P>
   A hearing on whether the plaintiffs should be granted
class-action status is scheduled to begin July 29 in Brownsville.
If granted, it would bring in most of the company's Texas
customers, including those in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   The suit alleges breach of contract, fraud, unjust enrichment
and violations of the state's Deceptive Trade Practices Act.
</P>
<P>
   The suit does not say how much money would be refunded if the
plaintiffs win, nor does it ask for specific damages. But a lawyer
for the plaintiffs, Mike Lynn of Dallas, said the amount involved
is ``well over $100 million.''
</P>
<P>
   In Austin, Southwestern Bell collects 94 cents a month per
residential line for municipal franchise fee payments and $2.84 a
month per business line, a company spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   A survey by the Public Utility Commission last year showed that
telephone utilities pay cities about $150 million a year. Most of
that comes from Southwestern Bell, which has about three-fourths of
the telephone lines in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The same survey reported that Southwestern Bell paid Austin
about $8 million a year; Houston, $35.8 million; Dallas, $20.6
million; San Antonio, $11.4 million; and El Paso, $4.3 million.

 &HT;    My dad enjoys a day watching the ponies run
 &HT;    By Gary Borders
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSSIER CITY, La. _ My brother and I brought my dad here to
watch the ponies run, a belated Father's Day present for a man who
doesn't get out much anymore, since a botched medical procedure
nine years ago left him disabled far too young.
</P>
<P>
   What happened to my dad is a tragedy. He was smart and talented,
making his living as a commercial artist and gathering a following
in Deep East Texas for his Western art _ pen-and-ink drawings of
cowboys and horses, acrylic paintings of Indians and old barns. He
was a fine artist who dreamed of giving up his day job painting
signs. That is, until he came down with a benign tumor on his
pituitary gland at the age of 58. The tumor threatened his
eyesight, so it had to be removed. Surgery couldn't get it all, so
radiation therapy was advised.
</P>
<P>
   He was overdosed by radiation, and his temporal lobe was
destroyed. Another brain surgery was necessary to save his life.
Before it was over, he was completely disabled, dependent on
medication and my mother. This happened to a man who hadn't spent a
night in the hospital since losing his tonsils as a child, who just
a few months earlier had spent a weekend in the summer heat helping
me build a shed, his endurance outlasting mine with ease.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors responsible for the mistake settled out of court for
enough money to allow my parents to live comfortably but not
lavishly. It's a poor trade. My dad takes a host of medicines each
day, everything from blood-thinning drugs to stop the clots in his
legs to anti-seizure medicine to keep his brain in check. He walks
with a cane and has trouble remembering things that happened an
hour or a day ago, though he can still recount incidents from three
decades past.
</P>
<P>
   Incredibly, he is happy most days, though his skin is on fire
from constant itching, a reaction to the drugs that doctors can't
seem to alleviate. He still spends much of his day drawing
caricatures, Western scenes and cartoons, some of which make it
into print from time to time. He still has talent, certainly more
than the average person, but nothing like what he had before all
this happened.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't complain much to his three sons and is thrilled when
we visit. He reads the newspaper faithfully and brags on me and my
brothers far too often. His tragedy and courage in the face of it
inspires me at times, though it also angers me, too. I have little
sympathy for those who would stop or greatly restrict people from
recovering damages when injured by negligence, because medical
negligence is what disabled my father, ended his career and nearly
put my parents under financially. Put a price on that if you will.
I can't.
</P>
<P>
   It was my idea to come to the races. The first plan was for my
brother, who came up to give my mother a break and a chance to go
home and visit her mother and siblings, to bring him down here to
see me. Then I realized the ponies had started running at Louisiana
Downs. My dad loves horses, has spent decades drawing and painting
them. Let's go see the ponies, I suggested.
</P>
<P>
   They watched while I gambled and largely lost. My dad sat
quietly, asking which horse I had placed my $3 on and then rooting
for my nag to win. Most times my horses finished out of the money,
but it didn't matter. He reveled in being out of the house and in
watching these fine animals fly through the mud. He reminded me
that he used to ride horses in Wyoming and Missouri. I knew that,
of course. I'm prejudiced, but in his prime, nobody could draw a
pen-and-ink sketch of a horse as well as he could.
</P>
<P>
   A fight broke out about halfway through the afternoon, outside
on the bleachers where it was steamy. We were inside in the air
conditioning, raptly watching the scuffle as if it was on TV. Two
guys went at it for about a minute, swinging wild roundhouse
punches that rarely connected while their girlfriends/wives watched
and contemplated joining in. My dad made some remark about how he
always enjoyed boxing, but I couldn't get him to lay down a bet
with me on who would win. Finally, security guards ambled up and
escorted the miscreants out of the facility. The horse races seemed
a bit tame after that.
</P>
<P>
   We left early and ate seafood at one of my favorite spots, Ralph
and Kakoos. My dad insisted on paying, and I let him. I left to
head back home, wondering if he would take up his drawing tablet
and try to capture what he saw on that hot, steamy Saturday
afternoon. I figure it's even money if he'll try to draw the horses
or the amateur boxers.

 &HT;    Playing tennis just another way for me to court disaster
 &HT;    By Phil Latham
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARSHALL, Texas _ I played tennis last night and, of course, the
results were predictable: I had to be carried off the court.
</P>
<P>
   It seems as if I have been carried off every playing field but
the ones at Eton and only because I've never been there.
</P>
<P>
   So it really wasn't surprising when, after making a particularly
remarkable serve _ remarkable for how far out of bounds it flew _ a
cramp in my calf sent me to the court in a heap.
</P>
<P>
   For my own part, I would have stayed there forever in my pain
until buzzards began circling, but progress and tennis must go on.
</P>
<P>
   The four septuagenarians in the next court who had been playing
tennis in the sun for, oh, six or seven hours and who were almost
about to break a sweat _ maybe, drug me off the court as they might
had a dying water buffalo suddenly expired at the midcourt line.
</P>
<P>
   The other members of my doubles foursome were appropriately
somber and concerned. Frank Dias said he would have been willing to
help me stretch my leg out if not for the fact that doing so might
have entailed looking up my shorts. Actually, I don't blame him a
bit.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't really want help, anyway. I was more into feeling
pitiful.
</P>
<P>
   Feeling pitiful, you see, because I had just come to a horrible
realization. Other than Frank, I really didn't know the other
players in our group. I got paired with a man (poor guy) I'd never
met before. He introduced himself as Jimmy Nolan.
</P>
<P>
   I would have sworn Frank told me that Jimmy was 38 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly he played like he was 38. Being a few years younger
than me he was quicker, could hit the ball a bit harder and
certainly his serve was far better than mine.
</P>
<P>
   Still and all, while I couldn't quite keep up with the snappy
38-year-old _ he was younger, after all _ I didn't do too badly
considering his younger age. If I had been just a few years younger
_ OK, maybe 10 or 12 years younger _ I could have been a good
match.
</P>
<P>
   I kept telling myself that I was glad this young guy was playing
with me instead of against me.
</P>
<P>
   And then I found out I had made a small mistake. Somehow in my
mind I had transposed the numbers. Jimmy Nolan isn't 38 years old,
he is 83.
</P>
<P>
   Eighty-three?
</P>
<P>
   Prostrate on the court, trying to hide the pain, that number
kept coming up in my mind.
</P>
<P>
   All Jimmy said was: ``A leg cramp? I've never had one of those.
Does it hurt?''
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy is 83 and he has been playing tennis at least twice a week
since he was nine. That is almost three-quarters of a century of
volleys, serves and running to the net. And not one leg cramp in
all that time.
</P>
<P>
   There is a God, and he favors Jimmy.
</P>
<P>
   This morning I am quite sure that Jimmy doesn't have a single
pain in his body after our match. I can barely walk, I have a
couple of nasty bruises on my hand from falling on the court and my
ego has been damaged beyond repair.
</P>
<P>
   I hope I am still playing tennis when I am 83 and, if I can make
it, I have no doubts that Jimmy will be in the foursome, running a
bit faster, hitting the ball a bit harder and not worrying a bit
about getting a leg cramp.

 &HT;    Is government powerless to stop hate-filled Web pages?
 &HT;    By Rowland Nethaway
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Vice President Al Gore claimed he invented the
Internet before Americans attacked the Internet for inspiring the
killers in Littleton, Colo., and last weekend's hate-crime spree in
Illinois and Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   This was unfortunate timing on Gore's part. But his invention
should not be linked to these tragedies for two reasons. One, he
did not invent the Internet. Two, there is no controlling authority
over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   There were calls to ``do something'' about the Internet after it
was revealed that the two teens who killed their fellow Columbine
High School students were Internet users who had a Web site with
links to sites that espoused violence and racism.
</P>
<P>
   Now it is learned that Benjamin Nathaniel Smith, a 21-year-old
college student who went on a three-day hate-inspired killing spree
in Illinois and Indiana, also had Internet ties.
</P>
<P>
   Smith had been a devoted advocate of the World Church of the
Creator, an Internet-based white supremacist group that is said to
be one of the fastest-growing hate groups in America.
</P>
<P>
   The reason that the World Church of the Creator has expanded so
rapidly has to be because of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The World Church of the Creator apparently is the creation of
Matthew F. Hale, 27, who lives in the pleasant suburban Illinois
home of his retired-policeman father.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever demons infect the brain of Pontifex Maximus Hale are
open to inspection to one and all on his Internet Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Hale's message of hatred for Jews and people of color _ mud
people, he calls them _ struck a chord with Smith, who joined
Hale's Web church.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Hale is upfront about his hatred for Jews and
nonwhites. But he is careful to say that his church really stands
for love _ love of white people. Hale concludes that his church
must hate Jews and nonwhites because they hate white people.
</P>
<P>
   When Smith, a good student and the privileged son of a doctor,
was named as the gunman who killed two and wounded nine others over
three days, Hale claimed Smith was no longer a member of his church
even though Smith had been named ``1998 Creator of the Year.''
</P>
<P>
   Frighteningly, Hale's message of hatred and his call for RAHOWA
_ Racial Holy War _ has attracted enough followers to establish 41
World Church of the Creator outposts in 17 states.
</P>
<P>
   An oddball hate-filled supremacist operating out of a room in
his father's house could never attract such a large following of
like-minded sickos so quickly without the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Government censorship of Internet material is not the solution
to the shootings in Colorado, Indiana and Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, government censorship of what Americans say,
write and publish _ even on the Internet _ is fraught with
constitutional hazards. How much different is it, if at all, from
government censorship of speech or of the press? It's hard to tell.
</P>
<P>
   More practically, the government can't stop it.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Gore's claims, scientists at the Rand Corporation more
than 30 years ago came up with the concept for a communication
system that would withstand a nuclear attack. With no central
authority, it would be be decentralized down to the level of each
individual anywhere in the world attempting to communicate. Even
with the nation smoldering in ruins, the Internet would keep on
sending information.
</P>
<P>
   Education and the constant exposure of Internet filth peddlers
to the sunshine of public scrutiny offer the highest likelihood of
public protection.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet, however, should never be considered a safe haven
for law-breakers. Crimes committed on the Internet should be
prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
   Education, public outrage and new forms of law enforcement are
needed to curb Internet rot.

 &HT;    Good equipment costs big bucks
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ I have found no way to get around the fact that
building furniture is an expensive hobby.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly if you're going to create a houseful of it, you'll
save money in the long run. But setting up a reasonably
well-equipped shop is a very expensive proposition.
</P>
<P>
   The only way I know to make it cheaper would be to eschew
machinery and use nothing but hand tools. You will certainly get
into good physical shape that way, and if you are quite young and
working wood only in your spare time, you might get the houseful of
furniture built before you're too old to lift a No. 22 plane.
</P>
<P>
   Some folks don't seem to be able to grasp the concept that good
equipment is expensive. For instance, this query from a woodworker
in San Francisco:
</P>
<P>
   ``I need some help locating and evaluating a used table saw,''
he writes. ``I can't spend more than a couple of hundred dollars,
but I want something good and usable, perhaps something I can add
to (extensions, fences, etc.).''
</P>
<P>
   Right, and when you solve that problem, see if you can find the
descendants of those Indians who sold Manhattan Island for $25 or
so and see if they'll take a couple of hundred for it, too. But let
the gentleman continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can any of you give me some guidance on what brands to look
for, what brands to stay away from, what problems to watch out for,
how to tell a good table saw from a bad one, what kind of problems
are not worth trying to fix and what are?''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly.
</P>
<P>
   1. You can't buy a usable table saw for $200. Forget it.
</P>
<P>
   2. The leading brands of home-shop table saws are Delta,
Powermatic and Jet.
</P>
<P>
   3. Stay away from brands that offer a new table saw for less
than $750.
</P>
<P>
   4. To tell a good table saw from a bad one: First, kick it. If
it doesn't wiggle and your toe hurts, continue. If it jumps and
your toe doesn't hurt, forget it. Second: Set up the saw for a
crosscut. Check the blade for squareness to the table. Take a small
piece of scrap wood in the neighborhood of a foot long and two
inches wide and draw a line from one end to the other to identify
the face side. Now cut it more or less in half. Turn one half
upside down (so that the line doesn't show) and put the cut edges
back together. If it's a snug fit, the saw is well-aligned. If
there's a gap at one edge of the mating, the saw blade and the
miter slot are out of alignment. They can be realigned, but the
question is whether they will stay that way. If it's a Delta,
Powermatic or Jet, they probably will.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say that all other brands of table saws are poor.
Most Taiwanese saws, which will be the bulk of the other brands
priced comparably to these, suffer chiefly from relatively lax
quality control. Some will be fine, some not so fine. There are a
lot of really great European saws, but they tend to be considerably
more expensive.
</P>
<P>
   Our correspondent continues:
</P>
<P>
   ``For instance: there is an ad in the local paper for a 10'' saw
with a 52'' jet fence for $750. It's a 5-year-old, Craftsman
contractor saw which has been modified by the owner. He added the
fence, extensions and a pedestal. How can I tell if he did a decent
job making the modifications, or should I stay away from this
one?''
</P>
<P>
   Stay far away.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the used table saws you see advertised are Craftsman
models. If you can find one that's 30 years old or so and in good
condition, it might be a good buy. The newer they are the poorer
they are. In my experience they are cheaply made, woefully
underpowered, and incapable of staying in alignment.
</P>
<P>
   This is why there are so many on the used market. They are
relatively inexpensive and people who think they will be adequate
buy one, find out they have made a mistake, and try to unload it.

 &HT;    `Out of the Rain' tackles the aftermath of AIDS
 &HT;    By Judith Green
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ ``I'm kind of a wannabe songwriter,'' says Michael
Ching, general director of Opera Memphis and composer of operas.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to write songs, what better role model than a
Nashville, Tenn., stalwart? So Ching's partner for ``Out of the
Rain'' _ the centerpiece of Georgia State's Harrower Summer Opera
Workshop this weekend _ is Hugh Moffatt, who has supplied songs for
Dolly Parton, Alabama, Kathy Mattea and Ronnie Milsap. He clicked
with Parton on ``Old Flames Can't Hold a Candle to You.''
</P>
<P>
   Not unlike country music, opera deals with raw feelings: pain
and loss, love and desire, rage and revenge. Could be that's why
Moffatt felt comfortable writing the libretto for ``Out of the
Rain,'' a work about the aftermath of AIDS as discovered by a group
of high school friends at the memorial service for one of their
crowd.
</P>
<P>
   It's Ching and Moffatt's second collaboration but isn't destined
to be the last. ``It's notexactly a sequel but the second in a
series,'' says Ching, 41. Their ``King of the Clouds'' (1993) was
about a single mother and her son confronting such matters as guns
and alcoholism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Social issues are never context-free,'' says Ching, which
helps the opera team provide a layer of grit to what might
otherwise be regarded as sentimentalized social work. Both these
pieces, and those to follow, are aimed at high school audiences.
</P>
<P>
   Ching is all-Asian by ethnic background, all-American by
interests. Three-fourths Chinese and one-fourth Japanese, he says
he would have been named Motoyama if not for World War II, when his
half-Japanese, half-Chinese father, a resident of Hawaii, felt it
prudent to emphasize the Chinese part of his background because of
anti-Japanese sentiment after Pearl Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   At an early age, Ching decided he wanted to be a composer. He
has written ``a modest amount'' of orchestral pieces, including
``The Gathering,'' which introduces the instruments of the symphony
and has been performed by the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra under
former associate conductor Darryl One.
</P>
<P>
   But with mentors such as Robert Ward (``The Crucible''), his
teacher at Duke University, and Carlisle Floyd (``Susannah''), with
whom he worked at Houston Grand Opera, it was no wonder opera
beckoned.
</P>
<P>
   Ching worked his way up the job ladder at Miami Opera (now
Florida Grand Opera), Virginia Opera in Norfolk, Triangle Opera
Theater in Raleigh-Durham, N.C., and eventually Memphis,
progressing from rehearsal pianist to artistic director.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fell in love with it by doing it,'' Ching says of his
growing credits in opera.
</P>
<P>
   He's written half a dozen, of which the most performed is
``Buoso's Ghost,'' a sequel to Puccini's comic opera ``Gianni
Schicchi.'' Among the others is ``Faith,'' based on a story by
James Patrick Kelly, a Hugo Award-winning writer of science fiction
(``Think Like a Dinosaur,'' 1995). These have been performed by
regional companies across the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Except for `Buoso,' it's mostly American subject matter,''
Ching says. ``I'd describe my style as very American, on the border
between classical music and music theater: Gershwin, Sondheim and
Bernstein rather than Elliott Carter or Milton Babbitt. And I do
like country music.''

TURBULENCE INJURES 63, PROMPTING NEWARK JET TO LAND IN BERMUDA 
</HEADLINE>
  (gm) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sixty-three people, including four flight attendants, were
slightly injured yesterday when a Continental Air Lines jet flying
from Newark, N.Y., to Puerto Rico encountered severe turbulence
just south of Bermuda.
</P>
<P>
   The jet made an unscheduled landing in Bermuda, where the
passengers and crew members were treated at a hospital for head and
neck injuries. Only one passenger, a middle-aged woman whose name
was not immediately released, was hospitalized. She had complained
of chest pains.
</P>
<P>
   Karla Villalon, a spokeswoman for Continental Air Lines, said
Flight 743 took off from Newark at 12:20 p.m. EDT and encountered
heavy turbulence in midflight at 29,000 feet, about 180 miles south
of Bermuda. She said she did not know whether all the passengers
were wearing seat belts during the turbulence.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities in Bermuda said they received a distress call
from the plane shortly before 3 p.m. and the plane landed at 4
p.m.at the Bermuda airport.
</P>
<P>
   The injured passengers were taken by three ambulances, a bus and
taxis to King Edward VII Memorial Hospital, the island's 220-bed
acute-care hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``The passengers are mainly complaining of neck pains, cuts and
bruises, but we see nothing immediately life threatening,'' said
Sheila G. Manderson, the executive director of the hospital.

COMPETITION GIVES HEADACHES TO BRAZILIAN PHONE CUSTOMERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (gm) 
 By SIMON ROMERO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAO PAULO, Brazil _ Like many people who tried to place
telephone calls as competition in Brazil's long-distance market
gradually opened this week, Antonio Carlos do Amaral Maia felt like
slamming down the receiver.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried Brasilia, Rio Preto and Aracatuba without success,''
said Amaral, listing cities he could not reach. Amaral, 34, a
bankruptcy lawyer with a small practice here added, ``I'll bet this
chaos will result in these new phone companies being nationalized
within a few years.''
</P>
<P>
   Amaral's lament was echoed by other Brazilian customers of phone
companies including MCI Worldcom and Telefonica SA of Spain, which
have bought pieces of Brazil's national phone system. After
competition was allowed in several regions of Brazil last weekend,
the long-distance network nearly collapsed in confusion and
technical problems.
</P>
<P>
   Only about 25-30 percent of long-distance calls have been
completed successfully since companies began vying for clients,
about half the call-completion rate under the old system, according
to Anatel, the government's telecommunications regulatory agency.
During some peak hours, only a fifth of long-distance calls were
completed.
</P>
<P>
   As individual consumers and corporate clients became
increasingly angry this week, the companies involved in the
tumultuous transfer to a competitive system scrambled to repair the
glitches. But the service breakdown has raised questions about how
the government has handled privatization in general.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, President Fernando Henrique Cardoso told the
telephone companies that they had 72 hours, or through Saturday
night, to fix the service. The companies said they would meet the
deadline.
</P>
<P>
   In Sao Paulo, where 40 percent of Brazil's phone calls are made,
the criticism has been especially acute. Residents had been fuming
for months anyway because of problems with the local phone system,
which was taken over last year by Telefonica. As Telefonica rushed
to install more than two million phone lines this year, adding to
the city's five million lines, the pressure on the system resulted
in phones going mute for days, misaddressed bills and crossed lines
with several discussions taking place.
</P>
<P>
   The government responded by fining Telefonica, together with the
company responsible for service in Rio de Janeiro, three million
reais, or $1.7 million. Now, because of the latest difficulties,
authorities have said the penalties may grow larger, with
Telefonica and other companies facing fines up to 40 million reais,
or $23 million.
</P>
<P>
   Brazilians expected more from privatization. ``There were
promises of services worthy of the First World,'' said CassiaMaria
Candido, 30, a primary school teacher who complained this week of
troubles when calling her mother, who lives in the interior of the
state of Mato Grosso do Sul. ``We now pay First World prices for
Third World service.''
</P>
<P>
   The government's response has been marked by differences within
Cardoso's Cabinet over who should administer the fines. The
communications minister, Joao Pimenta da Veiga, said the regulatory
agency should be responsible for fining the companies. But Renan
Calheiros, the justice minister, contended it was his
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the companies have blamed each other for the
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within our region we tested our networks, prepared for the
changes and everything is close to normal,'' said Stael Prata Silva
Filho, the vice president responsible for residential service at
Telefonica's Brazilian unit. ``The problems are originating mostly
at Embratel,'' Prata said, referring to the Brazilian long-distance
carrier operated by MCI Worldcom.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did a massive change into competition never before seen on
this scale,'' said Purificacion Carpinteyro, an Embratel
spokeswoman. ``We are all part of the network and were all
responsible.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Carpinteyro said Brazil's decision to switch into a system
of long-distance competition, in which the consumer chooses the
carrier with each call, through a code system, is more wide
reaching than similar systems in countries like Chile.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the difficulties have been traced to switches, a
technical term used to describe a computer program that routes
calls to other computers. Because some switches were not prepared
for the new system and others were overloaded by heavy traffic,
confusion ensued, Ms. Carpinteyro said.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the difficulties, deregulation has brought benefits to
the telecommunications system that would have been unthinkable a
few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The scarcity of phone lines under the old state-run system led
to the creation of a secondary market in telephone lines that were
bought and sold depending on demand. Before the privatization of
Telebras, the state company, some 10 million Brazilians were on a
waiting list for a phone. Now, a telephone line can be purchased
for about $500 on the secondary market, compared with as much as
$5,000 three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   By 2002, the number of lines is expected to rise to 33 for every
100 people, up from about 13 lines for every 100 today, according
to Marcos Silveira, head of the telecommunications practice at the
Sao Paulo office of KPMG, the consulting and accounting firm.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Brazilians are learning that such expansion does not
happen flawlessly.
</P>
<P>
   One prominent critic, Elio Gaspari, a newspaper columnist,
nominated Jar Jar Binks, the lanky Star Wars character, to head the
telecommunications regulatory agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has the best intentions, but as he himself admits, he's
clumsy,'' Gaspari wrote in the Folha de Sao Paulo. ``At least that
makes him agreeable.''

NETWORKS WILL ALL BE STEPPING UP TO THE PLATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HOWARD MANLY

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- No shortage of All-Star coverage this weekend. Anytime
a television producer can legitimately claim a game is not really a
game but rather a ``show,'' then get ready for a veritable bonanza
of programming.
</P>
<P>
   Fox airs the game Tuesday night. ESPN has the Home Run Derby
Monday night. And given the fact that the last All-Star Game this
millennium will be played right here at Fenway, our hometown
stations are stepping up to the plate with live updates, special
guests, and the usual assortment of feature stories. Remember, it's
not all about quality; it's about quantity as well.
</P>
<P>
   Take Fox. The network plans to triple everything. Instead of
eight cameras, Fox plans to use at least 24, including cameras
attached atop The Wall.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of two announcers in the broadcast booth, Fox plans to
use six. And not just any six. Joe Buck, the boy wonder of baseball
play-by-play, is calling the game with Tim McCarver, arguably the
best color commentator in the game. Bob Brenly is also in the
booth, while Steve Lyons works the American League dugout, Keith
Olbermann covers the National League dugout, and Thom Brennaman is
in the star-studded stands.
</P>
<P>
   Producer Michael Weisman justifies the increases in staff and
equipment. ``This will be one of the greatest assemblages of
baseball talents at one time in the history of the All-Star Game,''
Weisman said. ``There will never be a moment like this again. Think
about it. There will be 50 of the greatest legends walking to home
plate from center field. Then there will be the current All-Stars.
They will be followed by Ted Williams throwing out the first pitch
to none other than Carlton Fisk. We're talking goose bumps here. It
will the field of dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   Weisman is right. The game will be one of those dream
assignments for producers; anywhere they assign a camera, there's a
story. The players, the legends, the game, and, of course, Fenway.
``This is not a game,'' Weisman said. ``It's a show.''
</P>
<P>
   Weisman is not the only producer licking his chops. ESPN airs
the Home Run Derby live at 8 p.m. Monday night. Chris Berman calls
the show, along with Joe Morgan and New York Mets catcher Mike
Piazza. Stuart Scott and Rich Eisen work as on-field reporters.
Charley Steiner calls the Derby for ESPN radio.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN2 airs the first-ever All-Star Futures game, featuring top
minor league prospects, Sunday at 5 p.m. Dave Ryan, Ray Knight, and
Peter Gammons call the action.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, ESPN's ``Baseball Tonight'' airs at 7:30 p.m., and
after the Home Run Derby, the station will air taped coverage of
the celebrity hitting challenge, beginning at 10. The one-hour show
will feature actors such as Kevin Costner and Matt Damon, and
retired All-Stars Fred Lynn, Rico Petrocelli, Jim Rice, Dwight
Evans, George Brett, and Andre Dawson.
</P>
<P>
   CNN/SI airs an All-Star special throughout the day of the game,
starting at 12:30 p.m., hosted by Bob Lorenz and former St. Louis
Cardinals shortstop Ozzie Smith. The show features an interview by
Smith with Sox shortstop Nomar Garciaparra. CNN/SI's ``Page One''
features an essay by Jim Huber on Fenway Park Saturday at 1:30 p.m.
CNN/SI's ``Sports Sunday'' airs live from Fenway at 10:30 a.m.

IT'S STILL YAZ'S GAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Carl Yastrzemski was to the All-Star Game what Tip
O'Neill was to the US House of Representatives _ a constant
contributor from Massachusetts, always seen, and sometimes the best
player in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Yaz played 23 seasons for the Red Sox, was selected to 18
All-Star teams, and appeared in 14 All-Star Games. Ever a presence,
Yaz wasn't exactly a good luck charm for the American League. The
Junior Circuit lost 16 of the 18 games to which Yastrzemski was
invited.
</P>
<P>
   ``It got to be old news, us losing that game,'' he remembers.
``In those years, the National League probably had better
individual players and I think we had better, more well-rounded
teams.''
</P>
<P>
   Yaz is this year's honorary chairman of the monstrous, five-day
FanFest that continues through Tuesday at the Hynes Convention
Center and despite all the defeats, he lays claim to a couple of
big All-Star moments.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most famous All-Star play of all-time occurred when
Cincinnati Red Pete Rose crashed into Cleveland catcher Ray Fosse
to score the winning run in the bottom of the 12th inning at
Riverfront Stadium in 1970. It is the defining moment of the
Midsummer Classic, typifying why the NL dominated the game for two
decades.
</P>
<P>
   But who was the MVP of the Rose-Fosse game?
</P>
<P>
   Yaz.
</P>
<P>
   Playing first base and center field, Captain Carl went 4 for 6
and knocked in a run in the defeat. In the proud tradition of Sox
All-Star Republican outfielders, he gave his MVP trophy to
President Richard Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon attended the game and posed for pictures with rival
managers Earl Weaver and Gil Hodges before the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played three different positions that night,'' remembers
Yastrzemski. ``I started in left, then moved over to center and
ended up at first base.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today that (MVP) trophy is in Nixon's Presidential Library.
Starting with President Kennedy, I gave all the presidents a
trophy. I went to the White House to give Nixon that trophy and he
was a big baseball fan. He was thrilled. I remember him getting up
from behind his desk and he picked up a chair and said, `Sit down,
let's talk a little baseball.'
</P>
<P>
   ``After the '67 season, I'd been to the White House to give
President Johnson the grecian bowl I won as Sports Illustrated's
Athlete of the Year. It was Johnson's last day in the White House,
and my kids and I spent almost the whole day with him. He was
moving stuff out, but he was just great to be with.''
</P>
<P>
   In 14 All-Star Games, Yaz hit .294 (10 for 34) with two doubles
and five RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   Yaz never had tremendous recall of his own career. He is
constantly amazed at the precise recollections of devout Sox fans
who can recite more of his deeds than he can.
</P>
<P>
   ``Heck, I don't remember Wednesday,'' he acknowledges. ``My
first one was in Cleveland and the only thing I remember is that
there was a big to-do about Stan Musial, who was retiring that
year. It was a big thrill being there because Musial was one of my
idols.''
</P>
<P>
   Yaz would go on to win his first batting title in 1963, but he
was 0 for 2 in the All-Star Game. He was not selected in '64, and
skipped it because of a groin pull in '65. He made the team again
in '66, but manager Sam Mele kept him on the shelf at the new Busch
Memorial Stadium in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I remember about that day is that it was about 130 degrees
and during batting practice we wore pieces of cabbage under our
hats to stay cool.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1967 season was Yastrzemski's coming-out as an American
League star. En route to a Triple Crown, MVP season that would be
capped by his first World Series, Yaz went 3 for 4 at the All-Star
Game in Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played the whole game, 15 innings,'' he said. ``I walked a
couple of times. The thing I remember about that game is that we
had four Red Sox there, and Tony Conigliaro and Rico Petrocelli and
myself all started. Jim Lonborg had pitched Sunday, so he didn't
pitch in the All-Star Game, but to have four Red Sox players there
gave us a lot of confidence as far as the pennant race was
concerned. It made us feel legitimate.''
</P>
<P>
   He remembers making a couple of nice catches at the 1969 game in
Washington, one robbing Johnny Bench of a homer. Then came his MVP
performance with a losing team in '70.
</P>
<P>
   Yaz was there in 1971 in Detroit when the AL snapped its
eight-game losing streak. This was the game in which six Hall of
Famers homered: Reggie Jackson, Harmon Killebrew, Frank Robinson,
Roberto Clemente, Bench, and Hank Aaron. Jackson's mammoth blast
off Dock Ellis became instant baseball folklore.
</P>
<P>
   Boston's warhorse captain hit his only All-Star homer, a
three-run, pinch-hit blast off Tom Seaver in a 6-3 loss in
Milwaukee in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing I remember about that is getting pissed because Al
Dark was the manager and he didn't put me in left field after the
homer,'' Yaz said. ``The game was tied, 3-3, but we lost when the
left fielder (Claudell Washington, playing on the orders of Oakland
owner Charlie Finley) screwed up a ball in the ninth and they
scored three runs. Haywood Sullivan came up to me after and told me
I kept the TV audience watching a little longer.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1977, seven Red Sox were named to the team: Yastrzemski, Rick
Burleson, Bill Campbell, Carlton Fisk, Jim Rice, Fred Lynn, and
George Scott. The Red Sox had more stars than any team in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know we hit a lot of home runs, but we didn't win
anything,'' said Yastrzemski.
</P>
<P>
   Because of an injury, he was replaced by teammate Dwight Evans
in 1978, then he came back to go 2 for 3 in the '79 game at the
Kingdome.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I remember about Seattle is that I probably didn't want to
go because it was such a long plane flight,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There would only be two more All-Star chances, but no more hits.
He pinch hit in the 1982 loss in Montreal, then again in '83 when
the AL broke out with a 13-3 win at Comiskey Park in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember Montreal because Pete Rose and I were both hitting
like .340 and they flew us in there early for a cover shot for
Sports Illustrated, and Time was mad because they were doing the
same story and it was supposed to go on their cover.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew '83 was the last one. I had a lot of mixed emotions. I
had told Ralph Houk that I might not retire because we were in the
race and I was still hitting. But then we dropped out of the race
quickly in the second half and I knew that was it for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with Don Drysdale, Yastrzemski served as his league's
honorary captain in 1989, and this time he brought some luck in the
form of a 5-2 victory at Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always had kind of mixed feelings about the All-Star Game,''
he said. ``I wanted the time off because in baseball you need that
mental break in the middle. I never got tired physically, but I
liked to do something different for a few days. Still, when I'd get
there and be on the field, I wanted to be the best player.''

STEVE CARLTON HAD THE STUFF OF LEGENDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL SMITH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Steve Carlton stepped into the batter's box, tapped
his shoes, and dug in. He took a few practice swings and stared
down the pitcher. Steve Carlton got the signal from the catcher,
stood, looked toward first, then fired toward home plate.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Carlton stepped forward and swung at a 90-plus
mile-per-hour fastball out over the plate. He lined the pitch for a
two-out, bottom-of-the-ninth, RBI single to help Philadelphia
defeat St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   OK, OK. Steve Carlton didn't really get a game-winning hit off
Steve Carlton. But the scenario did occur in 1996, when Carlton, a
Hall of Fame pitcher with 24 years of service in the big leagues,
was the spokesperson for the All-Star Game's FanFest in
Philadelphia. One of the attractions at FanFest is the Video
Batting Cage, where the fans get to test their hitting skills
against a video image of a major league pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   Carlton got to hit against his digital self, and though the
situation may not have been as tense or as exciting as a real
at-bat, he nonetheless got a kick out of the experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hitting against myself was a lot of fun,'' said Carlton, a
former 10-time All-Star who has been involved with FanFest for four
years. He will be in Boston this weekend as one of 40 or so
baseball legends on hand at the Hynes Convention Center to sign
autographs, take pictures, and answer questions. Other legends
expected include Hank Aaron, George Brett, Bob Gibson, Paul
Molitor, and Bobby Thomson.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was spooky because the film is showing me on screen,'' he
said. ``And the cage was dark and not well-lit.''
</P>
<P>
   Did you hit the slider, Steve?
</P>
<P>
   ``No way!''
</P>
<P>
   Of course he didn't. Not many hitters could hit Carlton's
signature pitch, or any of his other pitches, for that matter. He
had an explosive fastball and was the true definition of a power
pitcher. But it was his sharp, biting slider, in addition to his
focus and work ethic, that made him one of the game's dominant
pitchers in the 1970s and early '80s. ``Lefty,'' as he was called,
won 329 games and struck out 4,136 batters. Only the Braves' Warren
Spahn racked up more victories as a lefty than Lefty. Only Nolan
Ryan has more Ks.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I played for other teams against Steve, I could hear the
righthanded hitters saying, `He may have gotten me out but at least
he didn't throw me the slider,' '' said Carlton's close friend and
former teammate, Tim McCarver.
</P>
<P>
   Even with his impressive career totals, his performance in 1972
for the last-place Phillies was downright amazing. He went 27-10
for a last-place team. Now do the math. Philadelphia won 59 games
that year. He also had a 15-game winning streak, and his 30
complete games included eight shutouts.
</P>
<P>
   Today's game is different for pitchers, but just for a little
added perspective, the Red Sox' Pedro Martinez, the present master
of the finished product, has 25 career complete games.
</P>
<P>
   Carlton, traded to Philadelphia in '72 after seven seasons with
the Cardinals, won the pitching Triple Crown that year as he led
the National League in wins, strikeouts (310), and ERA (1.97),
while pitching a league-high 346 innings. It was one of six 20-win
seasons, and resulted in one of his four Cy Young Awards. He won
the World Series with the Cardinals in 1967 (against the Sox). He
retired in 1988, and in 1994, his first year of eligibility, 96
percent of the baseball writers voted him into the Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Some resume, but Carlton is not the least bit concerned with his
place among the greatest pitchers in history. ``I was probably in
the best shape of any athlete at the time,'' said Carlton, a
martial artist. ``But you don't get to pass judgment on yourself.
That's not up to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Though hitters may have had a tough time getting to Lefty, he
wasn't able to slide his way out of a turbulent relationship with
the Philadelphia media. Carlton felt he was being abused and
mistreated by the press, so in retaliation he resorted to what was
known as the ``Big Silence.'' He did not speak to the press from
1974 to the end of his career.
</P>
<P>
   Radical, yes, yet Carlton has no regrets.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was perfect for me at the time,'' said Carlton, 54. ``It
took me two years to make up my mind. I was tired of getting
slammed. To me it was a slap in the face. But it (his silence) made
me concentrate better. And the irony is that they wrote better
without access to my quotes. It's all quotes, anyway, and it all
sounds the same to me. After that they wrote better and more
interesting stuff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took it personal. I got slammed quite a bit. To pick up the
paper and read about yourself getting slammed, that doesn't start
your day off right.''
</P>
<P>
   Carlton said he was slammed again in a 1994 article in
Philadelphia Magazine in which he says the writer incorrectly
portrayed Carlton's tendencies and his his political beliefs.
Carlton says that, contrary to the article, he has always been
approachable when it comes to signing autographs and interacting
with fans.
</P>
<P>
   You can see for yourself this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love FanFest; it's got everything about baseball,'' said
Carlton, who owns a sports marketing company called Game Winner,
based out of his hometown of Durango, Colo. Carlton says Game
Winner books his appearances as well as those of eight other Hall
of Famers. ``There's a lot of father-son things going on and a lot
of hot dogs consumed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a carnival atmosphere. The kids have a great time
with it.''

LONG BEFORE JACKIE ROBINSON, NEGRO LEAGUES PAVED THE WAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- It was the summer of 1992 and the weather was perfect
for visiting Cooperstown, home of the baseball Hall of Fame. The
skies were clear. Fans could be seen scurrying about this quaint
community in upstate New York. This was a prime day for collecting
autographs of baseball greats.
</P>
<P>
   But something was different. Yes, there were plenty of Hall of
Famers and baseball legends. But somehow, they seemed older, even
frail, and in some cases, sporting crutches and walkers. Maybe it
was because they had black faces.
</P>
<P>
   They were the descendants of the Negro League players. About 70
of them. Some of the name tags brought about instant memories,
especially if you were 40 or older. Most, you've never heard of.
They had come from every part of America to take part in a
once-in-a-lifetime experience. With pride, they accepted the
apologies of Major League Baseball for the injustices and the
racial prejudice they had incurred. Just by showing up, they were
able to say thank you to the game for remembering them.
</P>
<P>
   As they signed autographs and talked about their teams, each one
had a message. The demise of the Negro League had taken place by
1960, and most had said little since then. They said they were not
bitter, and it was not their fault they never got to play against
white players from the major leagues, save for barnstorming tours
in the first 27 years of the league's existence. They are grateful
that they were recognized. But after all these years, it really
doesn't matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't feel sorry for us,'' said John ``Buck'' O'Neil, who is
now chairman of the Negro League Museum in Kansas City, Mo. ``We
had a wonderful life. We weren't begging back then. We're not
begging now. We know we have a lot to do with the Jackie Robinsons,
Hank Aarons, and Ernie Banks.''
</P>
<P>
   The history of the Negro Leagues, which will be on display via
an exhibit at the All-Star Game FanFest, beginning Friday, is a
story as much about race relations in this nation as it is about
baseball.
</P>
<P>
   On first glance, you discover the barrier was always there for
Negro players, starting with Moses (Fleetwood) Walker in 1883. In
modern times, we look to Robinson and his signing by the Brooklyn
Dodgers in 1945 as a beaming light of reality. But he never had it
easy, either.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody today thinks about what it meant symbolically in 1962,
when Robinson became the first Negro League inductee to the Hall of
Fame. When he made it, suddenly there was room at the shrine of
baseball for Roy Campanella, Satchel Paige, Monte Irvin, Willie
Mays, and Aaron, all of whom began their careers in the Negro
Leagues. If they belonged, there certainly had to be room for Josh
Gibson, John ``Pop'' Lloyd, Buck Leonard, and Cool Papa Bell, who
were stars in their day but never got a chance to compete on a big
league team.
</P>
<P>
   The average age of the survivors of the league ranges from
70-95. Since 1992, the ranks have thinned. But some still show up
at major league parks for ``throwback days'', featuring the
uniforms of teams such as the Pittsburgh Crawfords, Homestead
Grays, and Kansas City Monarchs.
</P>
<P>
   The official start of the Negro Leagues didn't take place until
1920. But some 47 years before, Negro faces could be found paying
baseball for white teams but not without some difficulty. In 1884,
the lines of racism were firmly in place. But that didn't stop
Walker, a graduate of Oberlin College, from being the first major
leaguer. In 1883, the catcher played in 60 games and batted .251
for the Toledo Blue Stockings of the Northwestern League. The next
season, Toledo joined the American Association and was considered a
major league team at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Walker's brother, Weldy, became the second Negro major leaguer
when he signed a contract in July. He played just six games for
Toledo as an outfielder and batted .151. When Toledo dropped out of
the AA at the end of the season, it was also the end of the Walker
boys and any other Negro who wanted to play in the Major Leagues,
until Robinson emerged in 1947.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Encyclopedia of Negro Baseball, only three of
70 players appeared in organized ball by the turn of the century.
About half played for black teams. The fate of black players was
sealed in 1900 with the formation of the American and National
Leagues. No blacks need apply.
</P>
<P>
   The job of crossing the next bridge was accomplished by Andrew
``Rube'' Foster, who in 1911 emerged as the dominant figure in
black baseball. Foster was ahead of his time. He envisioned a Negro
League as early as 1907. Foster had been a star player and even
better manager at the start of the century. His 1910 Leland Giants
posted a 123-6 record. A year later, he joined the ranks of
ownership, buying a piece of the Chicago American Giants.
</P>
<P>
   The one thing Foster had learned in his years of barnstorming
was that good Negro teams produced strong revenues, much of which
had to be given to white promoters. He wanted a bigger share for
players, and, of course, himself. Because of their skin color,
these black players were fan favorites in their communities.
</P>
<P>
   Black baseball became as popular as going to church and
community economics was tied to success at the ballpark. From that
sprung the notion of a Negro League.
</P>
<P>
   In 1920, Foster formed the National Association of Professional
Baseball Clubs, also known as the Negro National League. It lasted
until 1931. But after only one season, there was a clamoring for an
Eastern League. The two leagues played the first colored World
Series in 1924. But after surviving a name change and frequent
player raids, the Eastern League began to lose teams, principally
because of losses from the 1929 stock crash. By the end of 1932,
both leagues had virtually ceased to function. Foster died that
year, and the concept of a Negro League appeared to die with him.
</P>
<P>
   But it didn't. Owners regrouped to form the Negro National
League, featuring six to eight teams. This league lasted four
years. In 1933, the Negro Leagues started playing night games. In
1937, the regional look reappeared _ The Negro American League in
the West and the Negro National League in the East.
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, the world changed. The start of World War II
brought people together for a common cause. After several years of
major leaguers and players from the Negro League playing each other
in exhibitions, there came a cry to allow Negro League stars to
play in the major leagues that would not be silenced.
</P>
<P>
   In 1946, there were East-West games in two cities _ Washington,
D.C., and Chicago, drawing 16,000 and 45,474. The Chicago game
featured Larry Doby, Leonard, Irvin, and Josh Gibson. Also playing
was Sam Jethroe, the NL Rookie of the Year with the Boston Braves,
and Piper Davis, the first Negro player to sign with the Red Sox,
in 1949. (Piper was cut at the end of spring training but was paid
$5,000.) When some of those players began to filter into the
majors, it was the fulfillment of Rube Foster's dream. And also his
worst nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   Only 13 years after the Dodgers first made Robinson the first
Negro to play in the majors in modern times, the Negro League
disbanded.
</P>
<P>
   The signing of Robinson, hailed as a great day for the Negro
League, quickly caused major league owners to realize how
vulnerable they were. Brooklyn obtained the rights to Robinson in
1945 without paying the Monarchs a dime. Bill Veeck paid $5,000 to
the Newark Eagles for Doby in 1947, but that franchise folded a
year later.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in history, scouts traveled the black
circuits. The Dodgers found Campanella, Don Newcombe, Dan Bankhead,
and Jim Gilliam. Mays and Irvin wound up with the New York Giants;
Hank Thompson with the St. Louis Browns before he was cut and
subsequently signed by New York. Jethroe became a Boston Brave, as
did Aaron. These defections hurt Negro League baseball. By 1949,
there were at least 36 blacks in organized baseball. Other young
blacks set their goals for the major leagues, not a traveling road
show.
</P>
<P>
   The same people who were content to watch black teams now craved
for news of Robinson and Doby in the majors. Black newspapers
stopped daily coverage of the Negro League in big cities as more
and more clubs elected to barnstorm. World War II had changed the
economics of the black neighborhoods and the interests of the
people who lived there. Teams did well to draw more than 2,000 a
game.
</P>
<P>
   After the 1948 season, the Homestead Grays, the New York Black
Yankees, and the Eagles all folded. The league still had teams and
two divisions, but it was not the same. The season ended with a
league championship. For the first time since 1941 there was no
World Series. Soon, there would be no league.
</P>
<P>
   As the 1950s rolled along, the number of black teams continued
to shrink. Games were shifted to non-major league cities. Blue-chip
prospects such as Frank Robinson, Bill White, Vada Pinson, and
Maury Wills became all-stars without ever playing in the Negro
League. By 1960, the league that produced some of the greatest
talent in history had been reduced to the baseball equivalent of
the Harlem Globetrotters. There was neither money nor the will to
survive.

HALL CURATOR EXHIBITS A LOVE FOR THE GAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL SMITH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- You think you know baseball. You're a bonafide expert.
You subscribe to all the magazines, you read a few books, watch a
couple of documentaries, and then wow your friends with your
seemingly endless knowledge of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Then you meet a guy like Ted Spencer. Then it's back to the
library.
</P>
<P>
   Spencer is a curator for the Baseball Hall of Fame in
Cooperstown, N.Y. He manages the museum and oversees its design and
presentation. He's also an avid baseball fan. His love for the
game, plus his position at the Hall, makes him a virtual baseball
encyclopedia.
</P>
<P>
   Did you know that Boston is the only city in America to have
professional baseball every year since 1871? And can you guess the
team? Didn't think so. It's the Braves, who now make their home in
Atlanta. These are the kind of facts Spencer can recite. He can
also tell you about a baseball team from Boston called the Tri
Mountains, and how they played a team from Brooklyn, N.Y., as far
back as the 1860s. Or about the Boston Pilgrims (who later became
the Red Sox) playing the Pittsburgh Pirates in 1903 in the first
World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Spencer and his staff will have a baseball from the Tri
Mountains game, a contract between the Pilgrims and the Pirates,
Babe Ruth's first contract with the Red Sox, and uniforms and
equipment of Sox Hall of Famers Cy Young, Ted Williams, Carl
Yastrzemski, Bobby Doerr, and Joe Cronin on display this weekend at
the All-Star FanFest's Hall of Fame exhibit at the Hynes Convention
Center. They'll also have a century-old scorecard from a Braves
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people just can't get to Cooperstown,'' said Spencer,
who has been a curator at the Hall since 1981. He's helped
coordinate the Hall's traveling museum since FanFest became a part
of All-Star Weekend in 1991 in Toronto. ``It's not that far from
Boston, but people really appreciate it in places like Denver and
San Diego.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides the uniforms and equipment of the Red Sox greats, the
exhibit will also feature more than 150 artifacts from other great
players and teams. Fans will see exhibits honoring such legendary
players as Walter Johnson, Mickey Mantle, Hank Aaron, Ty Cobb, and,
of course, Ruth. There will also be slide-shows, lectures, and
presentations by other members of the staff.
</P>
<P>
   Spencer says that the Hall, which attracts as many as 400,000
visitors a year, usually tries to bring as many items as possible
relative to the host city for the All-Star Game, in addition to a
few universal attractions.
</P>
<P>
   Which suits Spencer just fine. A Quincy native, he was named
after none other than Ted Williams. Spencer says he can remember
when 15 cents would get him from Quincy to Fenway Park. For 75
cents, he could sit in the bleachers, and $1.25 would get him a
seat in the right-field grandstand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boston is so rich in history, like Philly and Cleveland,''
said Spencer, who earned his degree in fine arts from the
Massachusetts College of Art. ``I grew up with a love for the game.
The game is much more valuable and important than I realized. It's
very, very important for the American culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like seeing grandparents bring their kids to the Hall and
say, `When I was your age . . . ' Older people have memories and
they want to talk. And I like it when people stop and thank us for
bringing the Hall to them. The best time is when we get to meet the
public. That's very gratifying.''

ALL-STAR EVENT IS NOW MUCH MORE THAN A GAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GREGG KRUPA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- At Major League Baseball's first official All-Star
Game in 1933, there was no Home Run Derby contest featuring Babe
Ruth, Lou Gehrig, the Red Sox' Joe Cronin, and the other leading
sluggers of the day. No cavernous exhibition hall near Comiskey
Park in Chicago was filled with baseball memorabilia and touring
fans.
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers did report that more than the usual number of
spectators turned out early to watch players from the National and
American Leagues practice. But there really was little more to the
first All-Star Game than the game itself.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Cronin would recall 50 years later that the first
All-Star Game also was supposed to be the last. Billed as the
``Dream Game'' or ``Game of the Century,'' organizers said they
wanted to play it during World's Fair in Chicago to bolster the
spirit of a nation _ and the finances of Major League Baseball _ in
the fourth year of the Depression.
</P>
<P>
   ``We also considered it a great honor then because we thought it
would be the one and only All-Star Game,'' Cronin said, in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   As certainly as the event has endured, it has evolved into far
more than just the game. ``I really think that in the last five
years, the All-Star Game has become a great spectacle,'' said
baseball commissioner Bud Selig. ``It's important in terms of what
it does for us as a wonderful way of showing off all that is good
about baseball, right in the middle of the season.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, the All-Star Game is part of a five-day festival that
celebrates the sport of baseball, something far larger and more
elaborate than Joe Cronin ever could have imagined. What Major
League Baseball has planned for fans in Boston, beginning with the
opening of the John Hancock All-Star FanFest, is the closest thing
to the hoopla of a Super Bowl that this city, with no domed
football stadium, is likely to experience.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Super Bowl _ and unlike the World Series, or the NBA
Finals, or Stanley Cup playoffs _ the All-Star Game is awarded to a
city years in advance. It allows time for organizers to plan all of
the events that surround the game.
</P>
<P>
   Spurred by the desire to promote the sport, the need to offer
sponsors a valuable opportunity to leverage their investment and
concerned that not all fans are rich or quick enough to buy
tickets, baseball officials have gone to extraordinary lengths in
this decade to make certain that the All-Star Game is more than
just the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first All-Star Game I saw was in 1950 at Comiskey Park,''
Selig recalled. ``That is the game that Ted Williams broke his
elbow, banging into a wall. It was just a game in those days. You
just played the game.''
</P>
<P>
   For a long time, that was more than sufficient for the fans and
for Major League Baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball's All-Star Game generally provides more action and more
memorable moments than all-star games in the other major sports.
Players and observers often theorize that, unlike football,
basketball, and hockey, it is easier in the more individualistic
sport of baseball to play a well-executed game despite the severely
limited time to practice with teammates for the game. It more feels
like a game than an exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   And it is one reason why Williams ran into a wall in 1950 to
field a ball, nearly ending his career. Williams has said that he
always made it a point of personal pride to play hard in All-Star
Games. That motivation provided fans with some memorable moments,
including the game-winning home run in Detroit in 1941 that left
Williams clapping his hands and prancing around the bases like a
young deer, and a home run off ``eephus ball'' pitcher Rip Sewell
in 1946 at Fenway Park, Williams's second homer of the game.
</P>
<P>
   There were other great individual performances, preeminently,
Carl Hubbell striking out five consecutive future members of the
Hall of Fame, including Cronin, in 1934. The athletic achievements
seemed to be all the all-star marketing Major League Baseball
needed until television brought the midsummer classic into the
nation's living rooms.
</P>
<P>
   But by the 1990s, officials saw that others were doing more to
maximize revenue and to burnish the brand of their sports, and they
decided to do the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``It followed the model that was established by the NBA and, in
some ways, Super Bowl weekend,'' said Abraham Madkour,
editor-in-chief of The Sports Business Daily. ``In many ways the
NBA was the first to pioneer this all-star week concept, saying
that we'll make it a full week and a celebration of our game and
our sport. We'll create an avenue where people who can't afford to
go to the game will really partake and enjoy the celebration.''
</P>
<P>
   For the NBA, the diversification and expansion of its All-Star
Game started with the dunking contest. Baseball's version is the
Home Run Derby.
</P>
<P>
   But baseball also has broken some significant ground along the
way, too. It was the first sport to sponsor the FanFest, a huge,
interactive exhibition that annually receives rave reviews. In
Denver last year, 80,000 fans attended. More than 80,000 are
expected at the John Hancock FanFest this weekend at the Hynes
Convention Center. Basketball, football, and hockey all have
launched similar events since the first baseball FanFest in Toronto
in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was in development for three years before that,'' said Drew
Sheinman, who created and produced that first FanFest. ``The idea
came in part from some of the minor league teams that had developed
local baseball carnivals with some interactive elements.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheinman, who had been a vice president for marketing for both
the Baltimore Orioles and the New York Mets, said FanFest is a way
of broadening the reach of the All-Star Game. ``There's no question
that it's very difficult when an All-Star Game comes to a local
market and there's a limited number of tickets _ especially in
Boston, with Fenway Park,'' he said. ``You really want to give the
community the opportunity to embrace the big event, to bring this
sport to the fans, and enhance the whole brand positioning of Major
League Baseball. This made a public event out of what is, in some
ways, a private game.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, in addition to the FanFest and the Home Run Derby,
nine other events will be held in conjunction with the All-Star
Game. For the first time, an entire day of festivities will be
created by adding the All-Star Futures Game to the inventory, and
pairing it with the All-Star Celebrity Hitting Challenge on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of Major League Baseball would not disclose any of the
financing of the All-Star events. But Selig and others said it is
much less a money-making proposition than a promotional event.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not even in the wildest scheme can you come up with a way to
make money on this,'' said Larry Cancro, vice president for
marketing for the Red Sox. ``It's promotional, absolutely. It's a
wonderful payback for the cities that have supported you, and it
brings to the forefront the importance of the Red Sox, because you
can see in one three-day period that there's a tourism component to
our existence here.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, a memorandum from Major League Baseball, seen by local
officials in Boston, reveals that Major League Baseball does not
always break even on the All-Star Game revenues and costs.
According to officials who have seen the memo:
</P>
<P>
   --In Cleveland in 1997, Major League Baseball spent $2.4
million, and revenues fell $153,000 short.
</P>
<P>
   --In Philadelphia in 1996, it spent $2.2 million and revenues
fell $130,000 short.
</P>
<P>
   --In Texas in 1995, $1.52 million was spent and revenues
exceeded that by about $200,000.
</P>
<P>
   --In Boston, more than $3 million will be spent on the All-Star
Game and events.
</P>
<P>
   ``You wouldn't say that it is really money lost,'' Cancro said.
``It's more just a part of the cost of doing business.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the revenue produced goes to charity. The Home Run Derby
is expected to raise about $700,000 that will be spent developing a
baseball diamond in Roxbury named for Jim Rice.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, experts say the All-Star activities are enormously
valuable as part of the overall corporate sponsorship of the game.
The John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co. and Fleet Financial
Group contribute anywhere from $250,000 to $450,000, either as a
separate deal for the All-Star Game or as a part of their overall
sponsorship of the game, according to Lance Helgeson, senior editor
of the IEG Sponsorship Report, a Chicago-based newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   Hancock is believed to be paying $800,000 to $1 million for the
FanFest alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the Major League sponsors actually do go for the
All-Star Game because it's really one of the biggest values that
Major League Baseball delivers,'' Helgeson said.
</P>
<P>
   But, for baseball purists, is it all a bit too much?
</P>
<P>
   Donald Honig, who lives in Connecticut, wrote about 40 baseball
books before returning to his first love, writing fiction. He has
had enough of the All-Star Game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It becomes an entertainment spectacle, with all of the hoopla
that proceeds it and then during the game,'' Honig said. ``I don't
watch it anymore. It's no longer baseball, it's an entertainment
show, and it doesn't interest me.''
</P>
<P>
   Others are less critical.
</P>
<P>
   In 1933, one of the motivations for establishing the game was
that Major League Baseball was suffering financially during the
Depression. Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis had slashed major
league rosters and cut his own pay by 50 percent. The All-Star Game
was a way of promoting the sport, just as it is now.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in the late 1950s and early 1960s, two All-Star Games were
played, in part, to raise money for the players' pension fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a baseball fanatic,'' says Patrick B. Moscaritolo,
president and CEO of the Greater Boston Convention &AMP; Visitors
Bureau, who helped to bring the All-Star Game to Boston this year.
``I played organized ball with Tony and Billy Conigliaro when I was
a kid in East Boston. But, look, even back in 1933, this was about
baseball, but it also was about business.''

WORLD NOT ENDING YET, NOSTRADAMUS DEFENDER ASSURES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BARRY SHLACHTER 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Rest easy. Predictions, circulated worldwide
and attributed to the 16th-century seer Nostradamus, that the world
will end this month are off the mark.
</P>
<P>
   By 1,700 years.
</P>
<P>
   That assurance comes from the head of the Nostradamus Society of
America, who happens to be a Fort Worth blues drummer and part-time
property title researcher named Vaughn Bean.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm upset because Nostradamus never said the world was going
to end in July,'' said Bean, who launched the ``society'' on the
Internet's World Wide Web after spending years researching a
self-published (at Kinko's) tome on the French astrologer,
``Remember the Future: The Prophecies of Nostradamus.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He said the world was going to end in 3797.''
</P>
<P>
   The fuss has been stirred up by a bestselling book in France by
fashion designer Paco Rabanne and numerous articles in the British
news media that cite a Nostradamus prediction that a ``King of
Terror'' will materialize from the sky in July 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Bean's calming words have been picked up and broadcast in
interviews from Sydney to London. Hours after discussing the matter
in a late late radio talk show, syndicated nationally here, he
appeared eager to take advantage of any notoriety that comes his
way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see anything wrong in trying to make something of
myself,'' said Bean, 42, who became a drummer in a succession of
rock and blues bands after graduating from Texas Christian
University with a degree in business and marketing. ``I'm like a
surfer. I'm going to ride this wave as long as I can.''
</P>
<P>
   A fellow musician friend crafted the Web site,
www.nostradamususa.com, which has attracted ``less than 100
members'' but launched the unknown, ``self-appointed'' director of
a made-up society as some kind of authority on the ever-popular
French clairvoyant. Call it the magic of cyberspace. The BBC has
rung him up three times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two and a half years ago, I realized there were Edgar Cayce
Society Web sites and George Washington Society Web sites but not a
Nostradamus Society Web site,'' Bean said. ``So I decided to fill
the void.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a historical society _ not a cult with a ranch house full
of young women somewhere,'' he quickly added with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   A lanky 6-foot-2 with wavy brown hair, Bean came dressed in
black shirt, black jeans and cowboy boots. He sipped a cold drink
at a west side coffeehouse, paused and then qualified his passion
for Nostradamus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not some whacked-out, obsessive person,'' he explained.
``I was the guy who stayed up all night for years and years
(studying) because I knew this was going to be big. Now that it's
hot, I've got to stay on top of it.''
</P>
<P>
   What he's staying on top of are four-line verses, known as
quatrains, barely fathomable in French, let alone in English
translation, that since their first publication four centuries ago
have never gone out of print. Their evergreen appeal, skeptics
assert, stems from the fact that they are so vague they can be
related to virtually any case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Often what is taken as prophetic is only due to coincidence,''
wrote one would-be debunker, Paul Kurtz, a professor emeritus at
State University of New York at Buffalo. ``His quatrains have been
adapted to all sorts of circumstances in every time period.''
</P>
<P>
   After hearing Kurtz's views, Bean leaned back and responded with
the mild rejoinder: ``I would call that person a skeptic.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the world is not facing an immediate apocalypse, Bean
tells interviewers that the July 1999 prediction seems to refer to
the current conflict between India and Pakistan, as well as the
tension between North and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Of Nostradamus' 942 prophecies, only seven come with dates. Of
these, just one falls in the 20th century, which makes the ``King
of Terror'' quatrain all the more significant, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Eastern Hills High grad doesn't know old French, let alone
the modern tongue, relying instead on a variety of translations to
base his interpretation of Nostradamus' murky forecasts. In fact,
knowing the language could be a handicap.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some reason, the French authors do the worst job,'' Bean
said.

   The trouble with shopping on the Internet is that you can't
touch anything. Fortunately, that may be about to change with a
motorized computer mouse that can give Web surfers the sensation of
texture _ or other physical attributes _ of items pictured on the
Net.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to last week's Web99 convention in San Francisco were
able to test out the ''Feel It'' mouse: running the cursor over a
picture of a tennis racket let a user feel the tautness of the
strings. You could also feel the texture of a pair of corduroy
jeans or test-drive a car, feeling how it handles the curves and
accelerates on the straight. And the mouse even simulates an
attempt to move through a heavy wind.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, the technology to create such a mouse was only
available in consoles and joysticks for computer games. Originally
developed by Stanford University and NASA, force-feedback
technology was first used for flight simulation.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Immersion Corporation in San Jose, Calif., managed to
achieve the fast data exchange rates needed to provide realistic
tactile sensations when someone is shopping on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   The mouse is attached to a pad that contains two motors in a
small housing at the top, one to move the mouse right to left, and
the other to move it up and down. As you move your cursor over an
image on a Web page, embedded motion commands are sent to a
microprocessor in the mouse, telling it how to move to produce the
desired sensation.
</P>
<P>
   Internet shopping sprees aside, one of the best applications for
this technology is in schools, says Robert Tinker, a physicist who
runs a nonprofit-making company dedicated to using emerging
technologies in education. Tinker plans to use the force-feedback
mouse to teach children about the forces of nature, especially the
atomic level forces they cannot see. ''With this technology, kids
can feel their way around a molecule,'' Tinker says.
</P>
<P>
   The $99 mouse goes on sale in the United States in the autumn.
For the technology to proliferate, Web designers need only download
free software from www.FEELtheWEB.com to embed the relevant Feel It
commands in images, says Ramon Alarcon of Immersion.  &QL;

   Most American farmers who have turned to genetically engineered
crops seem to be getting yields no better than farmers who grow
traditional varieties. They also appear to be using similar
quantities of pesticides.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the U.S. Department of Agriculture released figures
for 1997 and 1998 on the performance of modified cotton, maize and
soy beans. Some of the genetically modified crops produce an
insecticide called Bt. Others are modified to tolerate high doses
of the herbicide glyphosate.
</P>
<P>
   To study the use of pesticides on these crops, the USDA divided
the country into various different regions. In seven of the 12
combinations of crops and regions, farmers using modified crops had
had to add the same quantities of pesticides to their fields as
those growing non-modified crops.
</P>
<P>
   To study yields, the USDA looked at 18 crop/region combinations.
In 12 of them, yields of modified crops were no better than
traditional varieties.
</P>
<P>
   Companies promoting genetically modified crops have argued that
farmers growing them will benefit from improved yields and reduced
pesticide costs. And they are taking heart from some improvements
seen within the USDA's analysis.
</P>
<P>
   In one region in the Midwest, for instance, farmers planting Bt
maize had yields 30 per cent higher than those growing ordinary
crops. ''The analysis shows that crop biotechnology works,'' claims
Margaret Spike of the American Crop Protection Association in
Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   USDA officials, however, admit that at face value the figures
don't provide much support for those who argue that genetic
engineering will bring about a revolution in agriculture. But USDA
economic analyst Ralph Heimlich warns that the study could be
misleading. For instance, farmers who have embraced modified crops
might have had worse problems with pests to begin with.  &QL;

SCIENTISTS TIE BRAIN CHEMICALS TO IQ

   Do specific chemicals in your brain play a key role in how
clever you are?
</P>
<P>
   Brain imaging specialists in New Mexico have found a link
between variations in the levels of two brain chemicals and the
results of IQ tests. It's possible, they say, that changing the
balance of the chemicals with dietary supplements could give your
intelligence a boost.
</P>
<P>
   Concentrations of the chemicals N-acetylaspartate (NAA) and
choline are known to change when people suffer from brain diseases
or injuries. But the new study reveals that in healthy people,
levels of the chemicals account for a large amount of the variation
in people's IQs.
</P>
<P>
   NAA is found only in neurons and is thought to contribute to
their healthy function. Choline is present in nerve cell membranes.
When large numbers of neurons are injured or killed, NAA levels
drop and damaged cells release more choline.
</P>
<P>
   In patients with injured brains, this shift is linked to a loss
of cognitive function. But neuroscientist William Brooks of the
University of New Mexico in Albuquerque and his colleagues wondered
how the chemicals fluctuate in people with normal, healthy brains.
''We really didn't know what to expect,'' says Brooks. ''But we
were surprised by what we found.''
</P>
<P>
   From a local college, they selected 26 volunteers who had no
history of brain disease or psychiatric illnesses. They then used a
technique called magnetic resonance spectroscopy to measure levels
of NAA and choline in a brain region involved in a wide variety of
cognitive functions. Within a week, the students were given
standard IQ tests.
</P>
<P>
   The team found a strong link between levels of the chemicals and
their performance in the tests. Low levels of choline and high
levels of NAA were associated with high IQ.
</P>
<P>
   Statistical analysis showed NAA and choline levels together
could account for 45 percent of the variation in the IQ tests. In
comparison, a previous study showed that the level of a brain
chemical called creatine showed no significant link to IQ.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks speculates that in healthy people, levels of NAA and
choline may indicate the rate at which neurons are being damaged,
and thus the amount of energy the brain is using up to maintain
them.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you have healthy neurons, but you're struggling to keep
them repaired, it makes sense you won't be as cognitively sound,''
he says.
</P>
<P>
   But there is another possible explanation, says Brooks: NAA and
choline might directly enhance and inhibit the function of neurons.
If that's true, Brooks says it might be possible to improve
intellectual performance by manipulating the level of these
compounds with dietary supplements.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Gardner, a psychologist at Harvard University, warns that
other supposed biochemical indicators of intelligence have proved
unreliable. And he adds that performance in IQ tests can be
affected by many factors, such as the subject's health and their
motivation. He suggests that Brooks's images may in fact be
tracking one of these other factors.
</P>
<P>
   ''Beware the intelligence equals IQ equation,'' says Gardner.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks agrees that his results are preliminary. He and his
colleagues hope to examine more carefully what types of abilities
NAA and choline best predict in a larger group of volunteers.  &QL;

   Suicidal bacteria that sacrifice themselves to save their
neighbors from viral infections are triggering a dormant
self-destruct button. If the same type of mechanism exists in
harmful bacteria, it might be possible to develop drugs that
persuade whole colonies to commit mass suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Snyder and his colleagues at Michigan State University in
East Lansing first observed the suicide effect in a harmless strain
of Escherichia coli called K-12.
</P>
<P>
   When viruses called T4 bacteriophages invaded the bacteria,
infected cells died before the viruses could make multiple copies
of themselves. If the cells had survived, the copies would have
burst out and infected adjacent bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder showed that the bacteria self-destruct thanks to an
enzyme called Lit, standing for ''Late Inhibitor of T4''. Last
year, he and his colleagues discovered two other molecules that
react with Lit to thwart the virus. One is a bacterial protein
called elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu), which orchestrates the
production of all other proteins by the bacterial cell. The other
key ingredient, they found, is a region of the bacteriophage
protein coat called Gol.
</P>
<P>
   Now Colin Kleanthous and Ryan Bingham at the University of East
Anglia in Norwich, working with Snyder, have discovered how the
threesome sabotages the virus. They found that the key to success
is the stage when the Gol viral coat protein clings to EF-Tu,
changing its shape in some subtle way.
</P>
<P>
   Shape-changing somehow turns the bacterial protein into a target
for the Lit enzyme. ''It's to do with the protein being dressed up
properly for destruction,'' says Kleanthous. Once Lit has destroyed
EF-Tu, protein production in the bacterial cell shuts down
completely, denying the bacteriophage the chance to copy itself. So
the rest of the bacterial colony is saved.
</P>
<P>
   ''Lit is almost like a primitive immune system,'' Kleanthous
says .
</P>
<P>
   But the origin of the system is a mystery. Why should a protein
from a bacteriophage be the architect of its own destruction?
Kleanthous suspects that the bacteriophage initially needed Gol to
stick to EF-Tu so it could survive. But the bacteria somehow
''sussed this out'' and evolved the Lit enzyme as a sentinel to
counter the threat.
</P>
<P>
   If similar suicide mechanisms exist in bacteria that cause
disease, they might lead to new drugs. Patients could be given
injections of a substance which mimics the effects of Gol-like
proteins, causing the bugs to self-destruct.  &QL;

   UNDATED - Now, after all the people have left, all the thank-you

I can sit down and tell our story. Maybe it will be of help to

<P>
   Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis: What a name for a diagnosis that
dooms the patient to death. No cure, no real government research
support, no FDA support of drugs that can ease the burden, no
insurance company understanding of the need for coverage, and no
real time frame other than an average life expectancy of three to
five years after diagnosis. Some patients have gone longer, but
most last less. If it's not diagnosed early _ and there are still a
lot of doctors who don't know what to look for _ it can be too late
by the time a diagnosis is made for anything to help.
</P>
<P>
   ALS gets the young, the old, man, woman, priest, secretary,
rich, poor, wife, husband, brother, sister. Less than 5 percent of
the cases are inherited. It affects walking, talking, eating,
breathing. Wheelchairs, canes, ramps, hospice, home health care,
beds, special diets, support groups, church, work, community. All
become a part of your day. &QL; 
OUR JOURNEY
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Rorie and I were in San Francisco. I was on business, and, with a
long weekend, we decided to take some time for us. We had noticed
that she had started to slur her speech _ not always, just
occasionally. Someone had commented that after one glass of wine,
she was smashed. That's what led her to believe what the family had
been trying to tell her for months. Something was not right. She
also was having trouble with her right foot. Two episodes of
tripping and falling. (The foot doctor said all she needed was some
corrective surgery and all would be healed. What a dork!)
</P>
<P>
   A small thyroid problem was discovered, and she began medication
to treat it. That helped somewhat, but the slurring and foot drop
were not getting better. An MRI was next. What else could be
causing this? Brain tumor? Cancer? All of the really ugly (or so we
thought) diseases. But nothing showed up on the MRI. Now what? The
doctor suggested we consult a neurologist.
</P>
<P>
   We were scared _ not terrified, but anxious about what might be
causing this. Our attitude was that we'd just get another opinion
if we didn't like the first one. Besides, we had plans and dreams.
Rorie was going back to school to finish her degree; I was going to
work until she had a job, and then retire and become a flight
instructor. Great plans. ``Man plans and God laughs.'' &QL; 
QUESTIONS
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Begin ital) When did you first notice the speech problem? When
did you first have problems with your foot? Have you noticed muscle
twitches? Let's do an exam, and then we can talk.
</P>
<P>
   I have noticed what we call fasciculation _ muscle tremors. I
would like to do one more test, an EMG, where we will be inserting
a needle into different parts of your muscles and measuring the
impulses or motor neuron signals to be absolutely sure of what I
think, but I am pretty sure of your diagnosis: ALS. Have you ever
heard of it?
</P>
<P>
   (End ital)
</P>
<P>
   Silent shock! ALS. We were very familiar with it. A friend had
died recently after battling ALS. Now we were devastated. Not MS,
not a tumor, not something ``simple.''
</P>
<P>
   The diagnosis was confirmed by the EMG and a neurologist who
specializes in neuromuscular diseases. No mistake. We tell him
thank you. We have to come back in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ALS. We caught our breath. We cried. We hugged. We went home.
</P>
<P>
   Quiet in the house. Tears. Talking without really talking. Both
of us trying to work it out. OK, we can work with this. ALS, we can
do this. We're OK. No we're not.
</P>
<P>
   What to do. Whom to talk to. Let's get as much information as
possible before we have to go back to the doctor. Call the National
ALS Association. Don't tell the family until we're sure. Hold out
hope that maybe, just maybe, the tests will show something else. We
could live with MS.
</P>
<P>
   After two weeks, the kids are asking, ``How's Mom? What did you
find out?'' Info has come from the various sources. It doesn't
really say anything other than we're in for the ride of our lives
and to send away for even more info.
</P>
<P>
   All the test results are back, and the diagnosis is confirmed
again. ALS. Maybe we should try the Ford Clinic. Cleveland? Mayo?
Houston?
</P>
<P>
   (begin ital) But are you 100 percent certain?
</P>
<P>
   Yes. (end ital) &QL; 
THE FAMILY
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One daughter away at school. Son here. Other daughter in Ann
Arbor with her newborn son _ our first grandchild. He's struggling
to make it after surgery to repair his heart. Another whole story.
</P>
<P>
   We have to tell them straight. Tell them all at the same time.
Varied reactions. All sad, but all hoping that there will be hope,
help, a new drug. Let's get busy gathering data. This is our new
project, educating us so we can help Rorie. Daughter leaves college
and moves home.
</P>
<P>
   Rorie's sisters are in the hunt, too. Everyone is trying to help
us find a miracle out there. New drugs reported in various rags and
relayed by friends and family, but none have been approved. You
have to get in the lottery for a chance to get them. The first few
times we're rejected but told our request will go into the next
pot. It's expensive.
</P>
<P>
   (begin ital) How long until we hit the insurance cap? (end ital)
</P>
<P>
   Another project. Now we have to decipher insurance coverage and
definitions. The beginning of the hard questions. Who will take
over the information gathering? Who will put their life on hold?
Close friends _ actually family by default since ours live so far
away _ circle the wagons. Nancy, Rorie's best friend and surrogate
sister, says she'll be there no matter what.
</P>
<P>
   ALS, family and friends. The first requires the other two.
Without them, nothing can get done. This is not a disease that can
be handled alone. You find out what a friend is. You find out just
how very much you can't do by yourself. &QL; 
THE PLAN
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   OK. We need to plan. Go over wills and get a durable power of
attorney for health care. What's our financial position? Let's not
panic. We still have some time. Continue to work until it's too
hard to get into the job. Stick with the vacation plans. Let's talk
about remodeling the house. A bedroom and bath on the first floor.
Maybe another car that's easier to get in and out of.
</P>
<P>
   Initial panic, then a resigned atmosphere that we need to stop
worrying and live as much as possible. A few months pass.
</P>
<P>
   (begin ital) I'm not dying from ALS. I choose to live with it.
(end ital)
</P>
<P>
   She's braver than I give her credit. There's no real
breakthrough in the medications. The FDA doesn't consider this a
serious enough affliction to warrant a lot of time. Congress
doesn't fund ALS research. The doctors and researchers who are
fighting for a cure are almost alone. New drugs, new hope but no
cure. (Later, there will be a bill before Congress funding ALS and
neuromuscular disease research and putting pressure on the FDA to
get off its butt and let ALS patients have Myotropin, a drug that
has proven to add a few months to their lives. Initially, the FDA
couldn't be bothered.)
</P>
<P>
   We went to Hawaii. A few years earlier than expected, but it was
now or never. Our community, our friends pooled their
frequent-flier miles and hotel coupons so we could go. It was a
second-honeymoon dream to get there someday.
</P>
<P>
   Rorie really can't enjoy the beach. She's not steady enough to
stand and let the waves roll over her feet and ankles. The sand is
too hard for her to walk on, so we sit and watch others enjoy it.
It's a little difficult getting into the pool, but this is where
she wants to be. The legs work underwater. We take a helicopter
tour and an airplane ride _ open cockpit. She's afraid of flying in
anything smaller than an airbus. She flew with me a few times in a
single-engine Cessna but never really liked it. Now she's giving me
an open-cockpit biplane ride and not a word of complaint.
</P>
<P>
   It's peaceful here. She's happy. Maybe we'll just stay until . .
.
</P>
<P>
   (begin ital) No, let's go home. (end ital)
</P>
<P>
   Hand in hand. Slow, deliberate. Dragging the foot.
</P>
<P>
   January: (begin ital) Let's go to the mountains. (end ital)
</P>
<P>
   Great time. Bought a cane. It helps with the walking. She loves
the mountains. Spent a lot of time in the Colorado Rockies when she
was younger. &QL; 
ANOTHER PLATEAU
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ALS is a disease of plateaus. Always down, never up. The job has
to go. It's getting too hard to get into the car and drive. Almost
tripped in the lobby. The kids are worried. People who overhear her
talk wonder if she's had a stroke or if she's been drinking. The
kids press for medical equipment.
</P>
<P>
   (begin ital) Shouldn't we have it?
</P>
<P>
   No, not yet. Give her dignity a little while longer. (end ital)
</P>
<P>
   We go to the support group in Ann Arbor. Hopefully, we can find
one closer, but our grandson is still in the intensive-care nursery
and it gives Rorie a chance to see him and to hold him. The support
group is depressing. One man without the use of his legs, though
perfectly able to talk and eat. Another with a respirator since he
caught pneumonia, but still very active. Some old, many young. And
still no hope.
</P>
<P>
   (begin ital) Will I be like that?
</P>
<P>
   Yes. (end ital)
</P>
<P>
   Let's move. A house with everything on the same floor. Abandon
the big house. She loves to entertain, but it's not much fun
anymore. It's become too hard to do all the preparations and then
watch people look at you like you're disabled or shout as though
you were deaf. Without the muscle control of the diaphragm, she
can't generate enough air to speak above a whisper. Speech therapy
is next. Later, perhaps oxygen.
</P>
<P>
   (begin ital) No respirators. No heroic measures. (end ital)
</P>
<P>
   A do-not-resuscitate order in the living will.
</P>
<P>
   Time again for her family reunion. This time, it's on board a
cruise ship out of Los Angeles. It's a long way away, it's
expensive, but we go. She wants to see the family. She spent a lot
of time with her cousins growing up. We'll take the wheelchair. It
gets us on early and in line first. Big family gathering and a good
way to get away from home and doctors. Cousins strain to understand
her when she talks. They sit with her, push her wheelchair in port.
Push her around the dance floor in the disco. They know they
probably won't see her again. Tears. Hugs. Tough goodbyes. We
decide to stay longer in California and visit the cabin at Lake
Arrowhead where we spent our first honeymoon. We take the kids.
Lots of good memories. Lots of sad ones now.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time she asks, (begin ital) Why did I have to get
this damn disease? (end ital)  &QL; 
HOSPICE
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
The family is finally starting to realize the end is drawing close.
Time to take more time to smell the roses. The newest plateau is a
hard one: We need to start thinking about some help. Up in the
morning to help with the bath and dressing and toilet care. Home at
noon. Home early from work. She doesn't want strangers helping her
do such private things. Spend a lot of time doing maintenance
things late at night _ laundry, cleaning, paying bills.
</P>
<P>
   A new word enters the vocabulary: caregiver. A new job, only
more intense. Husband, lover, friend for almost 30 years. Now this.
For better or for worse. Strong statement. How many can live it?
</P>
<P>
   A decision has been made to ``talk'' about hospice. She's not
ready, but we need them. Angels enter the house: Hospice workers
give 110 percent and ask for nothing in return. $100 per day.
Limited days for now. More later.
</P>
<P>
   The insurance company says it won't pay for hospice. OK, let's
drag them into the 20th century. We can put Rorie in the hospital
for $1,000 per day, or they can approve hospice. Another battle. An
OK, very grudgingly, with a $20,000 cap. (This becomes another
battle later when the cap is exceeded.)
</P>
<P>
   (begin ital) So, who cares? Sign 'em up. (end ital)
</P>
<P>
   There's a retirement fund that can pay if needed. After this,
who's going to work another 20 years?
</P>
<P>
   Hospice comes three days a week, a few hours a day. Rorie
finally gets used to the angel _ Mary _ who is going to be her
friend, nurse, bather, dresser, listener. Mary becomes part of our
family. The family grows ever larger with great friends who
volunteer time, meals, errands or to just hang around for company.
Our church family gets its marching orders from Nancy. Judy,
Rorie's other surrogate sister, starts a weekly lunch visit _ food,
dishes, talk, listen. Judy and Nancy are a lifeline.
</P>
<P>
   We decide to take a weekend away with Nancy and husband Steve.
Up north in wine country. We used to do this all the time, but now
it's more important. Good time, even with having to lug the
wheelchair up a steep staircase.
</P>
<P>
   Christmas. Rorie's favorite season. She always goes overboard
decorating. The girls try to do it the way their mother would.
</P>
<P>
   Hospice is now fully involved, and Nancy, a home-health-care
nurse by trade, announces she's adding Mondays, her normal day off,
to fill the gaps in Rorie's care. Our oldest daughter, whose son is
still critically ill and requires in-home nursing care, takes
Fridays.
</P>
<P>
   Our son moves to Florida to go back to school. His mother tells
him to go and get on with his life. Don't put it on hold because of
her. She will miss him, and it pains her to see him go. She worries
when he and his wife drive non-stop for two days each time they
come home to see for themselves how she is doing. &QL; 
ANOTHER PLATEAU
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Equipment: chair, bath aids, suction machine, hospital bed. Over
the next few months, it all ends up in the house. A motorized
recliner is needed for comfort and ease of moving her. Another
fight with the insurance company. The doctor has ordered it, but
the insurance company doesn't think it's needed. So what? Insurance
workers should be given a six-month case of a disease that they
have to live with to get a taste of how their industry treats
people.
</P>
<P>
   Rorie spends most of her day in her recliner. Her legs ache, and
she needs me to adjust her position several times each night. More
time in the chair and a start at considering the hospital bed. The
regular bed is getting too hard to work with. She's exhausted. We
all are.
</P>
<P>
   (begin ital) I don't want to give up sleeping beside you. It's
the last of so many things lost. (end ital)
</P>
<P>
   The hospital bed stays in the garage for a while longer, and she
sleeps in the recliner.
</P>
<P>
   Eating is becoming a drawn-out affair. Even though swallowing is
becoming difficult, she eats what everyone else eats. No feeding
tube. Meals take on a new light. Eventually, it takes more than an
hour to feed her. Meals start early and end late. Thank God for the
people who drop a meal by. A lot of chicken. Sometimes something
special and different. Grateful for it all.
</P>
<P>
   We're all tired. Nerves are frayed. We're spending about 14
hours a day as caregivers. Demands are high. For better or for
worse, in sickness and in health. If this schedule continues, we'll
need to consider alternatives. Respite care, a nursing home. But
she wants to stay home. I want her to stay, but I can't give much
more.
</P>
<P>
   (begin ital) I'm tired. (end ital)
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the start of a hernia from lifting her in and out of bed,
in and out of her chair, in and out of the shower, the commode. I'm
not sleeping. Hospice is concerned. Her care is taking a lot out of
everyone.
</P>
<P>
   The insurance cap is met. Another fight for a (begin ital)
reasonable (end ital) amount of coverage. If we don't win this one,
I'll quit and take my retirement to pay for care. It's three weeks
before the company can make a decision. I hope none of them ever
need this kind of care, or do I? They need to live this to
understand. Cap is increased from $20,000 to $35,000. We're at
$28,000, and hospice is billing about $1,800 a month. Do the math.
Maybe a nursing home for a while, just to get a respite. Hospice
can get us in for about $125 a day.
</P>
<P>
   Another plateau: This time it's big.
</P>
<P>
   (begin ital) I want to see my mom. I want to see my son. I'm
tired of fighting, and I want to rest. (end ital)
</P>
<P>
   More candid talks late at night about us, the last 30 years, the
next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Finally in the hospital bed. She knows, we all do.
</P>
<P>
   It's done. A few days of being there. A few days of not.
Sometimes she's awake, sometimes coherent. The drugs help. We have
to keep increasing the dosages to help with the breathing and the
peace of mind. It's not going to be pretty. The kids are all here.
Her mom is here. Say goodbye now. Don't wait.
</P>
<P>
   (begin ital) Promise to take care of everyone. Promise. (end
ital)
</P>
<P>
   30 years gone.
</P>
<P>
   She wants to go back to Hawaii, ashes spread with orchids on the
sea. &QL; 
IT'S OVER &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So, we did all this. Over three years. Some days went fast. Some
went very slow. It was physically very demanding the last few
months. Mentally, you think you are prepared, but you're not. I
can't believe how ingrained our routine had become. Days after the
funeral, my youngest daughter and I were both up in the middle of
the night ready to move her, stretch her legs, help her get
comfortable. But she wasn't there. The hospital bed, everything was
folded up and in the garage waiting to be taken away. Katie and I
stood there in the dim light of the hallway and realized there was
nothing for us to do. Rorie didn't need our help anymore.
</P>
<P>
   People say they don't know how we coped for so long. We're a
family, and we did exactly what was required to make Rorie
comfortable for as long as possible. Toward the end, we were tired,
sick and worn out beyond comprehension, but we did what we had to
and blocked out the outside world for a while.
</P>
<P>
   We did the best we could.  &QL;

ONE MORE STRIKE AGAINST BASEBALL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It never fails. Whenever I start to lose interest in my
long-standing boycott of major-league baseball, I can always count
on one of these overpaid, self-indulgent ballplayers to deliver a
reality check.
</P>
<P>
   The wakeup call this time came from Juan Gonzalez of the Texas
Rangers, who declared himself unavailable for next Tuesday's
All-Star Game after the baseball fans of America failed to vote him
into the starting lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez racked up the fifth highest vote total among American
League outfielders, finishing behind Mr. Baseball, Ken Griffey Jr.
of the Seattle Mariners, and three members of the Cleveland Indians
who benefited from what might be described as unusually high voter
turnout in Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   In political circles, this sort of electoral aggressiveness is
known as ``stuffing the ballot box'' and practitioners of the art
are subject to prosecution. But in the strange universe of All-Star
electioneering, the real-world crime of voting early and voting
often is considered a legitimate element of baseball's fanocracy.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever. Gonzalez doesn't like it _ and he's willing to
sacrifice a $50,000 All-Star selection bonus in exchange for the
sheer exhilaration of thumbing his nose at the fans. Gonzalez makes
millions, so he can well afford to forego such pocket change to
snub those who snubbed him.
</P>
<P>
   Juan's apologists keep saying that he is acting out of
principle, that he is lodging a protest against a flawed selection
process that punishes true All-Stars and rewards lesser lights who
are lucky enough to play in a town where residents are willing to
wallow in shameless partisanship.
</P>
<P>
   I say this: Gonzalez isn't acting out of principle. He's acting
out of shameless brattiness, which is far more obnoxious than
shameless partisanship. The Rangers' Rafael Palmeiro was a victim
of Cleveland's election fixing, finishing second to the Indians'
Jim Thome in the voting for first basemen _ but Palmeiro's idea of
a principled act was to graciously accept an invitation to serve as
Thome's backup.
</P>
<P>
   No one should be surprised by Gonzalez' petulance. Two years
ago, I shared with readers an anecdote from a fellow boycotter
whose desertion of the onetime pastime was a direct result of
Juan's disregard for the just plain folks who have made him rich
and famous.
</P>
<P>
   The ex-fan recalled an incident during spring training way back
in 1991 when a young boy pleaded with Gonzalez for an autograph.
Here's the story:
</P>
<P>
   ``There was this kid with a broken arm hanging around the
clubhouse with his mom. He was probably 10 years old. He had his
book of baseball cards and as soon as he saw a player coming toward
the clubhouse from the parking lot, he'd have that player's card
out of the book ... his Sharpie open at the ready, and he'd
politely ask the player, by name, for his autograph.
</P>
<P>
   ``A van pulls up on the back side of the building and from the
sliding door emerges none other than THE GREAT JUAN GONZALEZ,
hobbling on crutches (knee surgery). This kid about has a coronary
waving to his mom to `get the jersey!' She goes over to this duffel
bag and pulls out this jersey and gives it to the kid.
</P>
<P>
   ``THE GREAT JUAN GONZALEZ can't walk up the sidewalk to the main
door of the clubhouse, but walks around to a back entry. The whole
time this kid is walking behind him saying, `Please, Mr. Gonzalez,
could I get your autograph, please?' and THE GREAT JUAN GONZALEZ
acts like he's deaf. Even the mother pleaded, `You're his favorite
player _ he's followed your career since the minors.'
</P>
<P>
   ``The steel door opens. THE GREAT JUAN GONZALEZ goes in, the
steel door closes and the kid is standing there in total disbelief.
The mother announced to the crowd that the jersey was one that THE
GREAT JUAN GONZALEZ wore in the minor leagues and they had come to
spring training hoping to get it autographed. ...''
</P>
<P>
   When I first related this tale, the pro-Juan crowd assured me
that he had changed, that he was working very hard to establish a
good relationship with the fans.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, right.

POP GO THE ADS, POP GOES THE USER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DR. EMILIO BOMBAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: Is there any way to disable those annoying
pop-up windows on the Internet?
</P>
<P>
   _2 Close 2 Insanity
</P>
<P>
   DEAR 2: You're not the only one getting cheesed off. I'm really
tired of going to my favorite sites only to be greeted by pop-ups
telling me where I can find hot pix of bikers marrying farm
animals..MDNM/ Sure, I went through that experimental phase like we
all did, but that was before I mistakenly took the animal husbandry
course at the local junior college.
</P>
<P>
   You see, the problem is that nobody has figured out how to make
a buck off the Internet except for those guys who start up
electronic widget businesses five minutes after graduation, go
public and retire as billionaires later that week. Advertisers, in
particular, don't have a clue. What they do in print and on the air
just doesn't work on the Net.
</P>
<P>
   So they hijack you.
</P>
<P>
   Banner ads, those nasty little animated commercials littering
Web sites everywhere and slowing everything down while they load,
were bad enough. They're easy enough to ignore, and if you don't
click on them, maybe they'll go away one day when the advertiser
figures out he's funneling his money into a black hole.
</P>
<P>
   More obnoxious by far are advertisers' attempts to carry you off
to their own cruddy little sites. They figure that if somebody
visits, say, a site specializing in exciting new things to do with
ordinary kitchen implements, he'd be grabbing for his Visa as soon
as he's magically transported to a fun-with-cooking-spray pay site.
</P>
<P>
   Insidious Web designers can put code in their pages that
launches new browser sessions when you visit or try to leave a
site. The new sessions invariably call up pages you never wanted to
see, which is exactly what the advertising guys want.
</P>
<P>
   But don't cash your paycheck yet, ad-boy. There are so many
people out there tired of seeing your stuff that you finally ticked
off the wrong ones: the programmers. There are at least a
half-dozen programs out there now that intercept banners and
pop-ups. Once they're loaded, they look for known advertiser
addresses, common graphic names (like Ad.gif) and the code that
pops up stuff you don't want to see. Off the top of my head I can
name AtGuard, InterMute, WebMask and InterQuick. Just do a Yahoo!
search for them (if you don't mind looking at a few more banners).
</P>
<P>
   Now, on the flip side, those ads do pay the freight for a lot of
Web sites. They have a right to be there. You, however, have the
right to ignore them the same way you do a new Pepsi commercial
during the Super Bowl. At least that little girl with Joe Pesci's
voice isn't quite as irritating as a banner screaming ``Click
me!!!'' Well, maybe. Web advertisers need to find a way to be less
annoying, and until they do, they're going to have to expect
countermeasures at every step.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: As an active member of a Mac user group and
one-half of the club's ``newbie'' class teaching staff, I want to
say that I share your opinion about Apple's advertising slogan
about ``Just plug it in.'' I couldn't agree more about the
time-consuming, often frustrating problems that face 90 percent of
all newbies. Just changing modems can be a real pain.
</P>
<P>
   _Realist
</P>
<P>
   DEAR REALIST: A Mac user agreeing with me? I must have been
wrong.

RAFTER WILL BE WHAT KEEPS AUSSIES AFLOAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB DUFFY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   He'd told them so. A month ago, when some nobody named Albert
Costa had dumped him out of the first round of the 1997 Australian
Open _ his national championship, for goodness' sake _ Patrick
Rafter had dolefully sought out his Davis Cup coach, Tony Roche,
and captain, John Newcombe, to inform them he was through as a
viable tennis force.
</P>
<P>
   His ranking had nosedived 41 places, from 21st to 62d, in the
past two years, and now had come the ultimate ignominy. ``I don't
have the ability to be a top 20 player,'' he'd moaned to Roche and
Newcombe.
</P>
<P>
   This had been news to them. They'd looked at him as if he were
bloody crazy. ``You're (expletive) kidding me,'' Newcombe had said.
</P>
<P>
   Well, what did they think now? Here he was in a real mess, two
sets down to France's Cedric Pioline in their opening Davis Cup
singles match, disgracing himself in his homeland yet again, just
as he knew he would.
</P>
<P>
   But what was this? Suddenly, his serves started clicking. His
relentless rushes to the net began yielding points. He grabbed a
set, then two, and before he realized it, he'd somehow won the
match, 6-4, in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   On the sidelines, Newcombe and Roche looked at one another and
smiled wryly.
</P>
<P>
   They'd told him so.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He couldn't wait to tell him. Newcombe was standing at center
court in Flushing Meadow, preparing to interview the 1997 US Open
champion for Australian television on this September evening, and
as they cut away to a commercial before the first question, the
champion relayed a breathless bulletin to Newcombe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to give all my prize money to charity,'' Rafter said,
the first words out of his mouth since he'd beaten Greg Rusedski
for the title. ``The whole $650,000 to the Starlight Foundation.''
</P>
<P>
   Newcombe, a board member of the organization that grants wishes
to chronically ill children, again looked at Rafter as if he'd gone
bonkers.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a little much,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, all right. Rafter reluctantly agreed to compromise. By the
time they came back on the air, he and Newcombe had settled on a
$300,000 donation.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, through the wrenching self-doubts and the
rapturous triumphs, including a second straight US crown last
September and the No. 2 world ranking, one thing about Rafter has
remained constant.
</P>
<P>
   His samurai hairdo notwithstanding, he just wants to be a
regular bloke.
</P>
<P>
   He is a delightful anachronism, spiritual descendant of those
swashbuckling Aussies in the glory days of the '50s through the
early '70s _ Newcombe and Roche and Rod Laver and Fred Stolle and
Roy Emerson _ who'd try to kill you on the court, then insist that
you join them for a Foster's, mate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had some pretty good celebration parties,'' laughs
Newcombe, who will call upon Rafter in singles when Australia faces
the United States in a Davis Cup quarterfinal at Longwood July
16-18. ``Pat isn't like some of the elite players. He hangs out
with guys ranked 200th, 250th, because they're his pals. He doesn't
care if they're top players.''
</P>
<P>
   It's no accident. Newcombe realizes that it's not natural for
tennis stars to remain natural, and he applauds Rafter's efforts
along those lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``He keeps a laid-back attitude,'' says Newcombe. ``He's really
trying hard to make sure it all doesn't change him as a person,
that he's going to come out of this in the end not changed in
character or personality.''
</P>
<P>
   Rafter, 28, is humbled by the mere mention of his name in any
context with the vintage Aussies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having the role models and a tradition like the Aussies had,
you know, it's such a great thing to look up to,'' he says. ``They
were big icons back in Australia. They went out there and they
tried their best, but at the end of the day, they are regular
people and they realized that all we're doing is playing a sport
and we shouldn't be looked at any differently than just that.''
</P>
<P>
   Playing for his country is one way Rafter expresses his
camaraderie. It's a given on his personal calendar. Each October,
when he maps out the next year's activities, he has two priorities:
the Grand Slam events and the Davis Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cup has been good for Pat,'' says Newcombe, ``and Pat has
been good for the Cup.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not surprising. He's always been a team player. He really
didn't have a choice.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jim Rafter owns a string of fish shops, a fortuitous enterprise,
because he needed much of the inventory just to feed his family. He
and his wife, Jocelyn, raised six boys and three girls in Mount
Isa, Queensland, the Australian outback. Solidarity and cooperation
were essential for survival to Patrick, the fourth-youngest son and
third-youngest child.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think about it,'' says Newcombe. ``A family that size, you've
got to learn how to get along.''
</P>
<P>
   As a matter of fact, it's the largest brood to produce an ATP
player, and its influence on Patrick is still evident.
</P>
<P>
   He acquired his charitable inclination from watching Jim, by no
means a rich man, put money in the poor box at church each Sunday
and hearing his father's gospel that one should feel obligated to
help those less fortunate.
</P>
<P>
   Jim also taught him to play tennis at the age of 5, bringing him
along to the courts with the three older boys.
</P>
<P>
   Pat was something of a late bloomer by tennis standards, beating
the bushes of the Challenger circuit through his teens and not
making an impact among the big boys until age 22, when he won his
first ATP singles and doubles titles.
</P>
<P>
   When he got a bit full of himself, his family put a quick end to
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started becoming a little bit affected by it,'' he says,
``and they pulled me back very quickly. It's a bit difficult when
people always want attention and things to put things in
perspective, because all you want to be is just a normal person, so
(they've helped).''
</P>
<P>
   There wasn't much to swell his head, just his ranking, in the
next two years until the turnaround match against Pioline. Its
lasting significance was that it illustrated Roche and Newcombe's
staunch belief in him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably nice having Tony and me around,'' says Newcombe,
``because he knows we're not there to be seen, we're there for the
right reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   Never was that more evident than in the tie against France.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't just coming back and winning that match,'' says
Rafter, ``it was also these guys having the faith in me to go out
and do the job, which made me feel really good within myself. I
hadn't that much confidence and we went into a big tie, and that
felt really good, to be one of the guys on the court playing.''
</P>
<P>
   He lost his final match in that series to Arnaud Boetsch, but by
then, Australia had clinched a 4-1 victory and Rafter had been
galvanized.
</P>
<P>
   ``He found that something down there,'' says Newcombe, clutching
his stomach. ``That fire in his belly.''
</P>
<P>
   Now there's only one thing he's looking for.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As much as Rafter desires to blend in, there's an area in which
he wants to stand out from the crowd. His goal is the No. 1 world
ranking, which would have seemed a delusion two years ago but now
is well within his grasp.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he's come close several times already. A victory in the
Italian Open in May would have done the trick. But he lost a
four-set final to Gustavo Kuerten. At Halle, Germany, less than two
weeks before Wimbledon, all he needed to do was beat No. 33 Jan
Siemerink in the second round to supplant Pete Sampras atop the ATP
computer list.
</P>
<P>
   He lost a third-set tiebreaker, 19-17. All that effort for
naught.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, he arrived at Wimbledon still ranked second, which may
have been a blessing in disguise since he didn't come to London as
the main target. But it was clear he would have welcomed the
burden.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The desire) is always going to be there,'' he said after his
second-round victory over Jonas Bjorkman. ``You're going to go on
the court with a thought that `If I win this next match, I could be
No. 1' or `I will be No. 1.' I mean, that's going to be there. So I
think you've got to face the fact that it is going to be there and
you've got to deal with it the best way you can. I'd like to be No.
1, no doubt about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet he willingly jeopardized that quest by continuing to play
doubles with Bjorkman even after rain forced the schedule to be
compressed in the second week. ``I made a commitment,'' he said
simply, though he finally withdrew from the doubles _ with
Bjorkman's blessing _ on the eve of his semifinal against Andre
Agassi, with No. 1 going to the winner. An exhausted Rafter lost in
straight sets.
</P>
<P>
   Newcombe believes that for a while, Rafter wanted the No. 1
distinction entirely too much, that it preoccupied him as he
struggled through the early part of the season for the second
straight year.
</P>
<P>
   He points to some other mitigating factors as well. Rafter
surprised the world, especially his country, by winning the '97
Open, and when he returned to Australia _ suddenly a big icon like
his revered predecessors _ he was smothered in demands and requests
for his time, his presence at this charity dinner or that TV
interview. Typically, he satisfied all of them, and as a result,
Newcombe believes he was ill prepared for the start of the 1998
tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone wanted a piece of him,'' says Newcombe. ``I think it
drained him.''
</P>
<P>
   After his second Open triumph, Rafter developed a knee problem
and wasn't in competitive shape when 1999 began. Once again, Davis
Cup was the elixir.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't start firing until Zimbabwe in April,'' says
Newcombe. ``We had 10 days to prepare, and after four days, you
could see he was back.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the captain believed Rafter's mind-set was stuck on No.
1. And as always, he was eager to impart advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell him not to get caught up in the hullabaloo about No.
1,'' says Newcombe. ``I told him just to play, `Do your best, win
some Grand Slams, and stop worrying about the big picture.' I think
he was much better off being seeded No. 2 (at Wimbledon) because he
didn't need the added pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Newcombe proceeds to supply some. He's already projected
the career track for Rafter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he'll win a Wimbledon, an Australian, maybe another US
Open,'' says Newcombe. ``I think that's his maximum _ five Grand
Slams _ because remember, he didn't win his first until relatively
late (age 25). I think he'll peak at the end of the year, be in and
out of No. 1 for the next two years.''
</P>
<P>
   Advised that Newcombe expects him to reach the top before the
millennium, Rafter rolls his eyes, shakes his head, and says with
mock exasperation, ``My God.''
</P>
<P>
   He ought to pay attention. Newcombe has been right about him
before, much to Rafter's relief.

DESPITE LAW, NUMBER OF DISABLED WITH NO JOB RISING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE E. LEWIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nine years after the enactment of the Americans with
Disabilities Act, the news from the trenches is not nearly as good
as people had hoped when the ADA became law.
</P>
<P>
   True, the act has had a significant impact on many of the
nation's 54 million disabled Americans, and on employers. It has
prompted the installation of ramps, rails, curb cuts, handicapped
parking, special computer equipment, and other devices that
accommodate people with disabilities. It has educated the public
and helped battle stigma and stereotypes in a nation in which youth
and physical beauty are revered. It also has paved the way to
employment for millions of people who, by and large, were
considered unemployable in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Given all that, there should be a lot to shout about as we
approach the 10th anniversary of the ADA. But if a survey by Louis
Harris and Associates in New York is any indication, there is a lot
more work to be done.
</P>
<P>
   The pollster has found that 71 percent of people with
disabilities who are of working age were unemployed in 1998, five
percentage points higher than in 1986, when the study was first
conducted. Three out of four of those not working said they would
like to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Employment continues to be the area with the widest gulf
between people with disabilities and the rest of the population,''
according to the survey of 1,000 people with disabilities aged 16
and older between April and May 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprising, this low rate of employment has led to an income
gap that shows no signs of narrowing. As a result, reports Louis
Harris, one in three adults with disabilities lives in low-wage
households with annual incomes of less than $15,000.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, talk of a booming economy increasing job opportunities
for people with disabilities doesn't jibe with the study's findings
_ or with advocates' expectations for the ADA, given its mandate.
</P>
<P>
   Were the expectations too high? Chai Feldblum, a Georgetown
University Law professor who wrote the ADA, says she never thought
the law would lead to big changes right away, especially in
employment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew that it was already hard to prove that a person was not
hired because of a particular characteristic,'' said Feldblum.
``What has happened, though, is that a message has been sent out
that a person can have a disability and still be able to work. The
intent was to have that message, over time, penetrate our
consciousness so that the law becomes a mechanism for changing
attitudes.''
</P>
<P>
   Feldblum may have gotten her wish. While the statistics are
grim, many people polled believed there had been significant
changes in public transportation, access, and the public's image of
people with disabilities. Presumably, their optimism stemmed from
their own belief in the ADA.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the question remains: Why aren't more people working?
Feldblum maintains that employers can still screen people out at
the hiring stage. And, she says, some people might suspect they
have been discriminated against, but most cannot prove it.
</P>
<P>
   But there is another problem. If a person with a disability
works full time or puts in too many part-time hours, he or she
risks losing federal and state-supported benefits and medical
insurance. Fear of being cut off is a strong disincentive to work
in a marketplace in which the cost of private insurance is
prohibitive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many parents are so afraid that there is a medical problem
right around the corner, they would rather have a son or a daughter
stay home than work,'' said Hank Cheney, president of Work Inc. in
Quincy, Mass. a nonprofit organization that trains people with
disabilities and helps them find jobs.
</P>
<P>
   One bright spot in all the gloom is a bill cosponsored by
Massachusetts Senator Edward M. Kennedy, a Democrat, and James
Jeffords, a Republican from Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   The measure is called The Work Incentives Improvement Act, and
it would revamp laws so workers with disabilities could continue to
receive Medicaid and Medicare benefits, even if they work full
time. It also allows them to choose between state-funded vocational
rehabilitation and private programs that link them to jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Under the bill, those who earn $75,000 or more would be required
to pay a full Medicaid premium. Those who earn under $75,000 could
buy coverage at sliding scale rates. People earning $25,000 to
about $40,000 per year would not pay more than 7.5 percent of their
earned income for Medicaid benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, once a disabled person is accepted into the Social
Security Disability or Supplemental Security Income program, he
also becomes eligible for Medicare or Medicaid. He can work but can
earn only up to $700 per month or he risks having his insurance and
cash payments cut off. The Catch 22: To collect basic benefits, he
must live in poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Connie Garner, a disability and policy adviser in Kennedy's
officer, says the bill was designed to fix what many now consider a
stumbling block. ``This bill is for people who are born with a
disability and the person who becomes disabled later in life,''
Garner said. The former ``is born into poverty; the rest wind up in
poverty after becoming disabled.''
</P>
<P>
   At 47, Martha Winship is well aware of the problem. A bakery
assistant at Roche Brothers supermarket in Quincy, she'd like to
work more than the eight hours she logs in each week, but worries
about losing Supplemental Disability Insurance, Medicare, and
Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   Winship is legally blind in one eye, totally blind in the other,
and developed a mental illness in her 30s. She earns $6.25 per
hour. ``Right now, I only work two days a week,'' she said. ``If
the bill passes, it will be a good incentive for people like me,
the part timers, to work more hours.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney, whose Work Inc. also trains people with disabilities,
says passage of the measure would go a long way toward lowering the
unemployment rate among the nation's disabled. ``Many people with
disabilities feel they have been left out,'' he said. ``We've
bypassed them, and they've become discouraged. . . The real break
is that when they finally do get a job, it's like watching a flower
starting to blossom.''

THERE'S LITTLE MYSTERY WITH CHINESE SQUAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ ``What?'' Yan Zhongjian says, his face done up in
amazement, as if someone just told him that the Great Wall has
crumbled into powder. ``Where did you hear that?''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone knows that the Chinese were so devastated at losing the
1991 World Cup at home that they disbanded their soccer team for
two years, their assistant coach is told. Didn't you?
</P>
<P>
   Yan shakes his head, smiling. Lost in translation again. So what
else is new? ``It is true that we did not compete internationally
for the next two years, but that is because there was nothing to
compete in,'' he explains. ``But we kept playing in our country.''
</P>
<P>
   Just like the ``disbanded'' Americans did. ``Everybody except
the Europeans disbanded their teams after 1991,'' US coach Tony
DiCicco says. ``Why? Because of budgetary problems. In 1992, we
played only two matches all year (one of them in Medford). The only
players we still had from the Cup team were Mia Hamm and Mary
Harvey. Everybody else was a youth player.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet when the Chinese didn't play anybody, they were thought to
be peculiar and reclusive and . . . mysterious. The M-word gets
used often about them, the way it gets used about lots of people
who live 15 time zones away and use a different alphabet.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, they're about as mysterious as Madonna, especially to
the American rivals whom they'll face in Saturday's World Cup final
in the Rose Bowl. ``We know a lot more about them than we did the
Nigerians or North Koreans,'' says DiCicco. ``We're practically
neighbors.''
</P>
<P>
   The Americans and Chinese were training partners the summer
before the 1991 Cup. They played twice in the 1995 Cup, twice in
the 1996 Olympics. They met three times last year, three times this
year. They know each other forward and back. They just don't know
each other because they can't talk to each other. ``They don't
speak much English and we don't speak any Chinese,'' says US
midfielder Tisha Venturini. ``So you give them the old wave in the
hall, but . . .''
</P>
<P>
   It's not like they attend social teas together. Nothing
personal. Just nothing in common except a soccer ball. ``We play
and then we go off to our separate corners,'' says US keeper Briana
Scurry. ``I don't know if it's the culture or what, but they seem
to like to keep the players together and apart. Maybe the
friendship thing is not conducive to playing well. I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese have been anything but reclusive during their month
in the States. They've flown everywhere by commercial coach,
cramming their carry-ons into the overhead bins. They've talked
willingly with the press (through an interpreter) after practices
and matches. ``We are friendly to every media,'' says Yan, ``and
all the exposures we have are positive.'' They hold practices in
full uniform, open to anybody with an Instamatic. ``There is no
reason to hide our numbers,'' shrugs head coach Ma Yuanan.
</P>
<P>
   No secrets, no mystery. You want to know about their program,
the Chinese will tell you about their program. They took up women's
soccer in 1983 because they saw everybody else doing it and because
it seemed to be a sport where they could excel. Soccer demands
grassroots numbers, a player identification system, organization,
and technical aptitude and the Chinese figured they had all of
those.
</P>
<P>
   They produce their soccer players the same way they produce
their Olympic athletes _ through a school system that provides
talent for provincial teams, which then supplies the national
age-group teams which feeds the national squad. The Chinese also
have a club league that is similar to the Americans' W-League. And
unlike the swimming and track teams, which have been dogged by
doping scandals, the soccer squad has apparently been doing it
without drugs. ``We never use these kinds of methods,'' insists
Yan. ``We never have that problem ever.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike their startling (and suspicious) Great Leap Forward in
other women's sports, the Chinese have become world-class in soccer
one foot at a time. They were fifth in the 1991 Cup, fourth in
1995, and second at the 1996 Olympics. Now, they're the Americans'
equals, if not their betters. ``We have a lot of respect for their
program,'' DiCicco says. ``They're a credit to the women's game _
and they're a fitting finalist here.''
</P>
<P>
   And if the Chinese beat their hosts, they won't rub their faces
in it by forming a victory ``train'' and chugging around the field,
as the Norwegians did to the Americans four years ago. ``The
Chinese are too classy for that,'' says Scurry.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans admire their ``mysterious'' rivals. They like
them. They just don't know them. ``I know one of them is a
Christian,'' offers Michelle Akers, who's been playing against the
Chinese for 13 years. ``But as far as their favorite foods or pet
peeves . . . I have no idea.''

HOW NOT TO HELP THE BALKANS 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANDRZEJ LUBOWSKI  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOSTER CITY, Calif. _ When President Clinton visited Slovenia
last month, he told people of other Balkan nations that they too
can be like Slovenians: living in peace and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   But while peace is within reach, prosperity will have to wait.
Slovenia, bordering Austria and Italy, enjoys a per capita gross
domestic product of more than $10,000 _ three times that of Turkey,
a NATO-member, at least six times that of Yugoslavia, and more than
10 times greater than Albania's. It will take generations for
Kosovars and Serbs to get to where Slovenians are today.
</P>
<P>
   Aiming high is healthy. Aiming too high and promising too much
leads only to painful disappointments.
</P>
<P>
   Citizens of several nations of the former Soviet bloc have had
their share of disappointments, confusion and self-doubt. In few
countries, however, did the fall of communism bring such
disillusionment as in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   It is a dismal story of transformation gone astray. Not only are
most Russians worse off today than 10 years ago, they will not
become better off unless things change dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, some of the former Soviet satellites, Poland
being the prime example, are legitimate success stories.
</P>
<P>
   While not every Pole is today better off than 10 years ago, few
would welcome a return to Communist days. For the average Russian,
who sees his country ridden by crime and corruption, the old,
fairly even distribution of misery under Soviet rule looks pretty
appealing _ and may even elicit nostalgia.
</P>
<P>
   Some time ago, Harvard University's Samuel Huntington wrote that
``drinking Coca-Cola does not make Russians think any more like
Americans than eating sushi makes Americans think like Japanese.''
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, the freedom to travel, to worship, to speak out and to
use the Internet doesn't make Russia a democracy. The presence of
the stock exchange does not make it a market economy.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Russia has abandoned central planning. But it has never
embraced the market, which, for many tired and impoverished people,
has now become a dirty word. Russia ended halfway. Halfway between
central planning and the market lies chaos.
</P>
<P>
   True, Russia had a much steeper hill to climb than Poland,
Hungary or the Czech Republic, where the damage to the work ethic
was less severe and memories of democracy and a market economy were
not totally extinct. And, unlike Russia, these nations were getting
rid of a system imposed on them by force from outside.
</P>
<P>
   But Russia never tried to transform fully its economic
institutions, despite what we in the United States, and our
leaders, desperately wanted to believe. To say that the market
reforms in Russia failed misses the point.
</P>
<P>
   Genuine reforms were never given a chance, and for that, part of
the blame can be placed on the West in general, and on Washington
in particular. On the other hand, Polish reform was radical.
</P>
<P>
   This was not only because the country's new leaders believed
that the economic benefits of such shock therapy outweighed the
costs. They also recognized that any historical breakthrough, such
as the fall of an oppressive system, creates a period of
extraordinary politics, when people are more likely to endure pain
for the sake of the common good.
</P>
<P>
   Such a period, however, seldom lasts long. It is usually quickly
replaced by the mundane, ``normal'' politics of contending interest
groups and parties. Poland, unlike Russia, had a credible and
highly competent opposition, ready to step in and act quickly and
decisively.
</P>
<P>
   Increasing hardships in Russia now threaten both economic
reforms and a still fragile political democracy. The longer it
takes for living standards to improve, the greater the risk of
political disarray. The longer it takes to deliver the goods under
democracy, the more attractive the authoritarian alternative will
become. So what has the United States been doing to help?
</P>
<P>
   We're forgiving Russia's debts and lending more _ despite clear
incompetence and rampant corruption.
</P>
<P>
   We've been convincing ourselves that progress is just around the
corner. We don't like what we are seeing, but we are afraid that
the alternative may be worse. We want to be pragmatic. We've become
hypocritical. We never held those in power in Russia accountable _
not even for what happens to the money provided by the America
taxpayer.
</P>
<P>
   We must not repeat these mistakes in the Balkans. There are, we
hope, some lessons learned:
</P>
<P>
   Our understanding of other nations and cultures is deficient,
which leads to frequent surprises. (We were surprised by the
persistence of Slobodan Milosevic and by Russian insecurity that
resulted in their capture of the Pristina airport.)
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to be a superpower on the cheap. There are
serious risks when well-justified moral outrage becomes the top
political motivation. To build democracy and have a shot at
prosperity, both Russia and the Balkans will need our support. But
this support cannot be unconditional, as happened too often with
Russia in the last eight years. If the pattern continues, we will
further damage our credibility and hurt the people we want to help.
</P>
<P>
   Moral capital, a shortage of which we often lament domestically,
is much easier to squander than to rebuild. If the outcome of the
Balkan crisis does not live up to the high standards that we set,
our credibility will suffer. We should be careful what, when and
whom we promise, unless we are certain that we can deliver.
Credibility is fragile.

HILLARY'S NOT-SO-SECRET ADMIRER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The current issue of the New Yorker has a brief article about
Hillary Clinton's not-so-secret ambition to become the nation's
first woman president. Various scenarios have Senator Clinton
(D-N.Y.) running for vice-president in 2004, after an Al Gore loss
in 2000, or running for the tob job in 2008.
</P>
<P>
   Well then, a wealthy Beverly Hills immigrant named Max Rhodes
proves to be even more clued in than the incomparably clued-in New
Yorker, because he has been pushing his Hillary for President 2000
campaign since the end of last year. Rhodes loves Hill, thinks Gore
has the scarlet (crimson?) L-for-Loser written all over him. ``He
appears weak, his voice speaks without conviction, and he lacks the
appeal that we need in a leader. . . . Al Gore himself does not
believe in his candidacy,'' according to Rhodes's campaign
materials.
</P>
<P>
   Rhodes has everything _ a pile of dough, a Web site
(www.hillary4prez2000.com), T-shirts, bumper stickers, a cheer and
even a fight song:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(poetry style) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   She's got the smarts. . .and she's humane
</P>
<P>
   She can even outwit Saddam Hussein!
</P>
<P>
   Hill's already a White House resident
</P>
<P>
   Let's save 'em a move and make her President.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(end poetry) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He also has Democratic Party mailing lists, and some big cheese
donors have been surprised to see his solicitations showing up in
their mailboxes. Rhodes lacks only one thing: Hillary's blessing.
``She does not support us, but we are in the process of changing
her mind,'' Rhodes says.

</P>
<P>
   Yes, it's all very nice that Billy Bulger is pumping University
of Massachusetts budget dollars into flashy ads hyping his ``new''
UMass. But several ongoing projects will report on a different side
of the Bulger family legend, to wit, the former Senate president's
famous fugitive brother, Whitey. Robert Redford has supposedly
optioned a Bulger family movie script from Mike Barnicle and Peter
Maas. Next year, Globe Spotlight Team editors Gerry O'Neill and
Dick Lehr plan to publish ``Ties that Blind,'' a book describing
the complicated relations among the Bulgers, the Irish Mob, and law
enforcement officials.
</P>
<P>
   And just a few weeks from now, Beacon Press will publish Michael
MacDonald's much-anticipated Southie memoir, which may begin the
process of burying Whitey's reputation as a modern-day
Irish-American Robin Hood. Here's the author on Whitey, on page
183: ``I thought it was pretty smart of him to position his liquor
and drug business right on the edge of our project, where more and
more kids were doing whatever they could to get drug money.''

   Okay, now that my Lady Paper Clips (Norway) are no longer in the
Women's World Cup, will I root for the Lady Prison Camps (China) in
Saturday's final? No, my heart is with the Northern California,
sorry, the US team, but my head tells me it's going to be tough
sledding for the Lady Gatorades. The Chinese are playing like they
invented the game. . . Because the New England Revolution is a
comparatively successful franchise, it isn't widely known here that
Major League (Men's) Soccer is on the verge of collapse,
nationally. Any bump that the 1994 US-hosted World Cup provided for
MLS has dissipated now, and several big-city franchises are sucking
wind. The long knives are out for commissioner Doug Logan, and some
speculation in Internet chat rooms has focused on Steve Gans as a
possible successor. Gans is a former professional player who
studied law at the World's Greatest University. He helped run the
successful Baltimore Blast franchise, and he has represented some
players in contract negotiations. . .A friend of mine whose company
has several hundred thousand dollars invested in the upcoming
All-Star idiocy, e.g. Matt Damon and Kevin Costner hitting
baseballs at Sunday's Celebrity Hitting Challenge, calls next
week's All-Star game ``the most elitist, blacked-out event in
Boston sports history. A normal Joe never had a chance to get near
a ticket.'' True enough. The Red Sox sold about two-thirds of the
park to season ticket holders and then turned the rest of the
tickets over to what is euphemistically called ``the baseball
family'' _ the fat cats who run Major League Baseball. Helpful TGIF
explanation: Ted Turner gets seats. You don't.

THE FEMININE SOCCER MYSTIQUE 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ As a typical Bud-swilling American male, I
didn't think any woman could get me to put down our culture's
sacred phallic symbol, the TV remote control.
</P>
<P>
   It took 11 women to get me to stop pushing those buttons, but
they did it, and it'll happen again on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Two-thirds of the TV audience for women's World Cup soccer has
been men, and the reason is simple, but not as simple as bouncing
ponytails and shapely legs, no matter how much you hear about
``soccer mamas'' and ``soccer babes.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, women's soccer is a great sport, and translates
well to TV. The couch criterion is the ultimate male test for any
sport.
</P>
<P>
   Mia Hamm, Briana Scurry and company have given average American
males soccer we can stand watching. In fact, during the
quarter-final game against Germany, I couldn't take my eyes off the
TV screen.
</P>
<P>
   During men's World Cup soccer you can take a nap for an hour and
not miss anything but hooligans getting drunker in the stands.
</P>
<P>
   Men's soccer is a reflection of the modern male psyche. It's
defensive and insecure. Men keep diddling with the ball the way
they do with the TV remote. The object of the male game is to keep
opponents from scoring.
</P>
<P>
   Men are funny that way. They don't want to win as much as not
lose.
</P>
<P>
   The object of the female game is to score. Women want to win,
and how often do they get a level playing field? Women's soccer is
a reflection of the modern female psyche. The women are constantly
on the move, attacking, subtly tripping each other, and shooting
for the goal.
</P>
<P>
   Male soccer players, at least in my limited World Cup watching,
are big whiners and fakers. They're always falling down, holding
their poor little shins and pleading with referees.
</P>
<P>
   Women soccer players, at least in the two games I watched, went
down on the turf after being firmly planted there. The only blatant
fake injury was when a Brazilian player was carried off the field
on a stretcher and then leaped up and tried to get back in the game
again.
</P>
<P>
   Women have a long way to go before they become as skillful at
malingering as men.
</P>
<P>
   Women's soccer is by far a greater sport than women's
basketball, particularly for guys who are forced to comment on it.
</P>
<P>
   After initial statements from men about the wonderful team
spirit, the sentence you always hear about women's basketball is:
``It's like men's basketball the way it used to be played.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, yes, wasn't basketball something when it was played by short
white guys? In other words, ``pretty good for girls.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the worst male chauvinist doesn't want to be caught saying
anything like that, especially about women who can slam-dunk him
through the parquet.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, we now have a women's soccer craze, and you won't
find a male American saying it's ``pretty good for girls.''
</P>
<P>
   It's pretty good for men. And here's why.
</P>
<P>
   Men can enjoy women's World Cup soccer without having to nod
while their wives say it's good for their daughters' self-esteem
and personal development. It's just good.
</P>
<P>
   In women's basketball, there are always clumsy, embarrassing
interludes when confusion reigns under the basket and the game goes
to pot. When things get confusing in front of the goal in soccer,
the game gets more exciting, just like hockey with a loose puck in
the crease.
</P>
<P>
   American men can enjoy women's soccer without having to say,
``It's like men's soccer the way it used to be played.''
</P>
<P>
   We have no idea how it used to be played. Instead we say it's
like hockey without the sticks and pads, and no need to put a silly
glowing halo around the ball so the nearsighted can follow the game
from the couch.
</P>
<P>
   There also is no need for fights that clear the benches, because
the women soccer players are brutal enough just doing it with their
Nikes.
</P>
<P>
   I don't care if women soccer players are role models for our
daughters. Our daughters will do fine. Women are better than men,
especially at things that don't involve brute strength, like
soccer, school and being sensible.
</P>
<P>
   Women's soccer is good for men's personal development. One day
women will be at least half-running the world. We can prepare for
that day by watching women tear up a literally level playing field,
skillfully kicking inflated leather spheres.
</P>
<P>
   Get used to the management style. Men are doomed, and women's
soccer tells us why.

THE SUMMER OF '99 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOAN ANDERMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Given our culture's current obsession with the '70s, it's no
surprise that Donna Summer, perhaps the quintessential voice of the
disco era, has resurfaced. Ever-savvy VH-1 picked this moment to
produce a ``Behind The Scenes'' episode about Summer, a televised
concert special, ``Donna Summer: Live &AMP; More _ Encore!'' The
network and Epic Records have also released a live album with the
same title that was recorded at the concert. The CD, a compilation
of greatest hits and three new tracks, was released last week, and
entered the Billboard charts at No. 43. That's no small feat for an
artist who hasn't been in the collective pop-culture consciousness
for a good 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   This week Summer began a 35-city tour that stops in Boston, her
hometown, Wednesday at BankBoston Pavilion. She'll also sing the
national anthem at the All-Star game at Fenway Park the night
before. Summer's soprano is as smooth and booming as it was in her
heyday, a remarkable feat that the 50-year-old grandmother
attributes to the grace of God. But song and spirit weren't always
in harmony for Summer. On the contrary, a painful ambiguity of
faith and ambition, which evolved into a wrenching identity crisis,
nearly destroyed Donna Summer at the peak of her success.
</P>
<P>
   One could trace the genesis of Summer's conflict to 1968, when
she left Newton, Mass. and a strict religious family for the wilds
of New York, where she was quickly recruited for the German touring
company of the musical ``Hair.'' But Summer fingers that first,
now-infamous hit single of 1975: ``Love To Love You Baby.'' It was
a 16 minute and 50 second moanfest that tranformed dance floors
into erotic playgrounds and Summer into a sex goddess.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was never comfortable doing that song,'' Summer says on the
phone from Atlantic City, the first stop on her tour. And yet her
delivery managed to sound so . . . persuasive. ``Those `oohs' and
`aahs' came out because I hadn't written all the words,'' she
explains matter-of-factly. ``I didn't know what to sing. We were
goofing around. I wanted to give `Love To Love You Baby' to someone
else. I never, never wanted to do that song.''
</P>
<P>
   But Summer was a newly divorced mother of a baby girl (Mimi, now
26), when she met producer Giorgio Moroder in Munich in the early
'70s and recorded the demo tape of ``Love To Love You Baby.'' When
the late Casablanca Records chief Neil Bogart stumbled upon it, he
immediately licensed the song and signed the fledgling singer to
his label, and his wife, Joyce, became her manager. ``At that
point, I was under the guidance of people who I thought knew what
they were doing. They said, `Do this till we get from point A to
point B.' But inside I kind of fought it all along. It didn't fit
with my spiritual background.''
</P>
<P>
   Summer was born Donna Gaines, the third of seven children born
to Mary Ellen Gaines, a teacher's assistant who died in 1995, and
her husband, Andrew, a now-retired electrician. Growing up,
Summer's musical idol was gospel singer Mahalia Jackson. ``I
sounded like Alfalfa on `The Little Rascals,' '' recalls Summer.
``And Mahalia had such a big voice.'' Her love of singing, as well
as her deep religious faith, was nurtured Sunday mornings at the
Grant African Methodist Episcopal church, ``at 1906 Washington
Street'' Summer announces proudly.
</P>
<P>
   Summer characterizes her childhood as a constant struggle for
attention, a state of mind that would feed the troubles she
encountered down the line. ``I had such low self-esteem. There were
a lot of kids and the focus was not on me. But I always talked to
God, from the time I was a little kid. When I was about 8, I was
singing in church, and I heard a voice. I knew it was God. And he
said that this was my power, and that I would be famous.''
</P>
<P>
   How ironic, then, that it was a gift from God that would unravel
Summer's spirituality almost to the point of no return. As her
powerful soprano and pulsing dance tracks became the defining sound
of the disco craze in the late '70s, Summer strayed further and
further from her faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``Needless to say, that was a low point in my spiritual life,''
says Summer, whose image as an icon of hedonism and sensuality
included performing that song with a machine blowing steam between
her legs. Summer struggled to reconcile her public persona with the
religious belief system she had always relied on to sustain her. At
the same time, she began to suffer the fallout of massive fame. A
rapid succession of hits _ ``Bad Girls,'' ``Hot Stuff,'' ``Last
Dance,'' ``MacArthur Park'' _ followed Summer's 1975 debut. And so
did the pressure. ``It's like if you woke up tomorrow morning and
you were president of the United States. Everyone's calling you,
wanting you. You go to the ladies' room and you can't get out. That
success, and all that goes with it, it was beyond my human ability
to deal with it,'' Summer remembers. ``There was no room for me in
this thing anymore, there was only room for the image. Yeah, I was
depressed.''
</P>
<P>
   Symptoms became increasingly severe as the decade wore on, and
Summer was finally hospitalized in 1979. ``I started to feel
fragmented, everyone scared me,'' Summer says. ``I was insomniac.
The doctors put me on drugs for the depression, and they put me on
drugs to help me sleep. That's when I started getting suicidal. And
I thought, `God, if you don't help me, I won't make it.' I know I
wouldn't have made it another week and a half.'' What happened next
is something, Summer says, that many people still have a hard time
accepting. ``It was very simple, though. God delivered me. That's
it. In a moment. I can pinpoint the moment. My doctor, who was
administering these heavy drugs, said I couldn't get off drugs that
fast. But I did, and I was healthy. I was different.''
</P>
<P>
   Summer's next album,``The Wanderer,'' was released in 1980; it
included the song ``I Believe in Jesus'' and a special thanks in
the liner notes to ``the Supreme Being, the Creator, without Whom
there would be no beginning or no end.'' She continued to have
hits, most memorably 1983's ``She Works Hard for the Money,'' a
song that has since gone on to make Summer a fortune in advertising
royalties. But as disco waned, so did Summer's star.
</P>
<P>
   And that's the good news. Feeling ``complete'' for the first
time in years, she dedicated herself to family life: Summer,
songwriter Bruce Sudano, her husband of 19 years, and their two
daughters, Brooklyn and Amanda, now 18 and 16, relocated in 1991
from Los Angeles to Tennessee. They split their time between a
house in Nashville and a 104-acre farm outside the city. Summer
began painting in earnest and has released a series of gospel
albums.
</P>
<P>
   While planning her greatest hits album, ``Endless Summer,'' in
1993, Summer began working on an autobiographical musical called
``Ordinary Girl.'' The process has been cathartic, marking a return
not only to musical theater _ Summer's first love _ but to the
singer's tumultuous past. ``I had gotten some Broadway offers, but
I turned them down. I really felt I needed to establish myself in a
role no one else had done. So I started thinking about my life.
Mistakes. Good moves. Actions and reactions. Difficult times,''
says Summer, who has written all the songs and fleshed out
characters and a story line. Alfred Uhry, who wrote ``Driving Miss
Daisy,'' is currently working on the book. While the title doesn't
exactly seem to reflect Summer's experiences, she points out, ``I
got married, had a baby, got divorced. I think a lot of people can
identify with those things.''
</P>
<P>
   Summer thinks a great deal these days about the stage. In recent
years she's learned to draw more on her early acting experience for
her live shows and cites Judy Garland as her model for performance.
In her concert, ``each song is like an acting piece, and I sing
each one as a different woman,'' says Summer, who is touring with
an eight-piece band and two dancers. ``I want you to go home
feeling like you've heard songs, but that you've also learned
something about me. My goal isn't to make you understand I can
sing. It's to make you understand this trip.''
</P>
<P>
   One musical memory Summer won't be revisiting, however, is that
infamous first single. Summer hasn't performed ``Love To Love You
Baby'' since the early '80s, and says she never will. ``It's just
not where I am in my life. And it brings out a real weirdness in
people.'' Pressed to elaborate, Summer says only ``trust me.
Weirder than you can imagine.'' Audience members, she confirms,
have been known to become quite inspired by the song, leading to
overzealous public displays of affection.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line, however, is that Summer's audience is still out
there, and it's a devoted one. Despite the fact that interest in
her is fueled largely by nostalgia, Summer is grateful. ``I don't
think they even knew they were devoted. I think they woke up one
day and said, `Hey, I remember that.' People say to me that I was
the soundtrack to their lives. It makes you feel really good to
feel you're a part of someone's life you don't even know. That
something you've done has affected someone.''

EARNHARDT JR. FOLLOWS INTIMIDATING FOOTSTEPS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUDON, N.H. _ He isn't just Generation X, Dale Earnhardt Jr. is
Generation Next. He isn't just the Second Coming, he is the Second
Coming of the Intimidator. A dyed-in-the-wool racer just like his
father Dale Earnhardt Sr. and his late grandfather , Ralph
Earnhardt, Dale Jr. _ or ``Little E'' as he has come to be known in
NASCAR Winston Cup circles _ has emerged as the next in line to the
family throne once his father, a seven-time Winston Cup champion,
steps down and focuses his attention on being a full-time owner.
</P>
<P>
   And when the torch is finally passed, Junior's crown will rest _
fashionably tipped to one side, no doubt _ atop his way cool,
blond-dyed, Caesar-cut hairdo.
</P>
<P>
   If Dale Earnhardt Sr., a huge fan of Brooks and Dunn, is a
little bit country (and western), then his 24-year-old namesake is
certainly a product of the music of his times; an amalgam of rock
'n' roll . . . grunge . . . alternative . . . hip-hop . . . and
rap. An avid drummer, Junior's eclectic musical tastes range from
Nirvana to Pearl Jam to Limp Bizkit to Puff Daddy and to Bridge, an
upstart group of alternative musicians from North Carolina whom
Earnhardt befriended and has actively promoted.
</P>
<P>
   But when it came to Earnhardt's own much-anticipated Winston Cup
debut in the Coca-Cola 600 May 30 in Charlotte, N.C., the distant
drum beat became more intense with each day that led to his first
start in the No. 8 Budweiser-sponsored Chevrolet Monte Carlo
fielded by his father's team, Dale Earnhardt Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Dale Earnhardt Jr. will make his second of five Winston Cup
apprenticeship runs Sunday in the Jiffy Lube 300 at New Hampshire
International Speedway. But he'll arrive a bit banged up from the
chipped right shoulder blade he suffered in a wall crash during a
practice run for last Sunday's Busch Series race in West Allis,
Wis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still a little sore now, but I'm ready to go,'' said
Earnhardt, who started from the back of the pack and finished
third. ``The worst thing about getting hurt was spending the three
days in therapy that I could have used doing stuff I wanted to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Like getting in some practice time on his drum set.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Little E's meteoric rise from reigning Busch Series
champion and current points leader to the Winston Cup stage was not
unlike a garage rock musician making his live concert debut at an
all-star jam session before a packed 100,000-seat stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad and all my family and fans were all like, `Hell, yeah.
This is the weekend we're finally going to get to see Junior run,'
'' Earnhardt recalled during a break in an NHIS test session last
month. ``I was like, `I'm finally going to get to race,' and
everybody had a good attitude about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Everybody, it seemed, except his father.
</P>
<P>
   After Dale Jr. turned a tight lap around the bumpy, 1.5-mile
oval at Charlotte to earn the No. 8 position in the starting grid,
outperforming his father, who qualified 14th, reporters rushed to
Earnhardt Sr. for a comment. But the Intimidator was surprisingly
lukewarm and not at all effusive in his praise of his son's
accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It went a hundred times better than I expected it to go, but
we just knew that from testing we had a pretty good package for
that (qualifying run),'' said Dale Jr., who wound up finishing 16th
after running up front for a time during the grueling 600-mile
race. ``I was really glad we accomplished that because there were
so many opportunities for mistakes in that qualifying run. So when
it was over with I was like, `Yeah,' '' _ he pumped his fist _ ``
`That's what I was expecting.' ''
</P>
<P>
   As for his father's reaction?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, he was a little standoffish,'' Dale Jr. acknowledged.
``He's just very careful about that. I don't know if he does it out
of aggravation, because people pester him with questions about
`What do you think about Dale Jr.? What do you think about Dale
Jr?' Or maybe he does it because he feels like it's going to put
pressure on me, but I don't think it's gonna.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why he feels that way, but he's just very careful
about what he says about me, and what he does about me. I don't
know, but he just doesn't want me to get overconfident or
whatever.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Earnhardt Sr., ``He surprised a lot of people, including
me. We knew he could drive a race car, but until you start winning
on the racetrack and see how you react to the daily pressure, it's
hard to know what you've got inside you.''
</P>
<P>
   That explains why Earnhardt has been so protective of his son's
career, and why it was decided to carefully choose five races to
acclimate Dale Jr. to the rough-and-tumble, dog-eat-dog environment
of the Winston Cup circuit before he began a full-time campaign
next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hope your kids turn out OK and then when they take up what
you do, you worry about 'em because of the danger factor,'' Dale
Sr. said. ``I didn't tell him no, but just let them do what they've
got to do. I guess he's watched enough tapes of his granddaddy to
learn how to drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looks like he's been doing it for a while. He's got good
rhythm and feel for the cars. He's got confidence and he really
communicates well with the crew. If he stays focused, then whatever
happens happens and, hopefully, the championships will come.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dale Jr. realizes that for that to be a possibility, many
factors have to fall into place. You have to have the right
situation, the right owner, the right team, the right sponsor and,
most important, the right equipment.
</P>
<P>
   It all had to be just right, especially if he was to shoulder
the awesome responsibility of carrying on his family's name.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just didn't want to become a failure too quickly or to be
labeled a failure too early,'' Dale Jr. said, citing his biggest
concerns about making the jump to Winston Cup. ``There's a lot of
people out there, a lot of race car drivers who can accomplish
things, but will never get the chance. There's some drivers who may
be really, really good race car drivers, but got the wrong
equipment or got involved with the wrong team and were not
competitive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are the things I was worried about. I didn't want to be
labeled a loser or a no talent. But (driving for his father) feels
natural and it feels comfortable and, hopefully, it can continue at
this pace. I feel ready and I feel willing to do it. I just want
everybody here to have the same winning attitude.''

VISIT TO TINY RHODE ISLAND IS HUGELY REWARDING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KAREN NELIS  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MISQUAMICUT, R.I. _ Rhode Island may be the smallest state in
the union, but its breathtaking ocean views, vast stretches of
sandy beaches, elegant mansions and world-class music festivals
make it a big vacation destination.
</P>
<P>
   Rhode Island offers history and art in its capital city of
Providence, music and excitement in Newport, spectacular and
pristine scenery on Block Island, and quiet, family-oriented beach
communities along the South County shoreline.
</P>
<P>
   Newport, a major port city in the late 1700s, rivaling Boston
and New York, became a summer getaway in the 19th century for the
richest families in America, who built elaborate ``cottages''
overlooking the Atlantic Ocean. Newport today is known for those
mansions, as well as its jazz, blues, folk and classical music
festivals.
</P>
<P>
   In the Gilded Age of the 19th century, those seeking to avoid
the hustle and bustle of the Newport summer social scene and
pursuing a less ostentatious display of wealth headed down to the
South County coastline, including the area around Misquamicut and
Watch Hill. Today too, the South County region is the quieter, less
crowded vacation destination of those wanting sun and sand but who
can do without the scores of chic restaurants and boutiques of
Newport.
</P>
<P>
   It was this quieter beach region that my family, traveling with
a not-quite 3-year-old, opted to visit on a week-long vacation last
summer.
</P>
<P>
   Misquamicut, where we stayed, where large malls and
tract-housing developments are simply nonexistent, is clearly
geared to a relaxed, low-key pace. The miles of sandy beaches along
the South County shore were crowded on weekends, but emptied out
come Monday. Even the small amusement park located on the main
section of the beach was nearly deserted on that warm Monday
evening.
</P>
<P>
   A few dozen small strip motels lie near the beach; only a couple
are located right on the beach. We chose to stay about a mile away
at a resort hotel offering better accommodations and amenities,
including an outdoor pool, shuffleboard, daily continental
breakfast and twice-weekly barbecues by the pool. Our large room
also featured a private balcony, refrigerator and microwave oven.
Hundreds of rental cottages and condos are available throughout the
region.
</P>
<P>
   The shoreline was divided into private beach areas for residents
or those with passes issued by various hotels, including ours, and
the public section at Atlantic Beach Park. Parking at the beach
ranges from $5 to $8 a day for those without a pass.
</P>
<P>
   The beach was beautiful, the water temperature comfortably cool.
</P>
<P>
   If you're looking for any diversions off the beach, however,
you'll have to look hard or be willing to take some short
side-trips as we did out of the immediate area.
</P>
<P>
   We made two separate excursions to Mystic, Conn., which is only
about 15 miles, or a 25-minute drive, from Misquamicut. We spent
one overcast morning at the Mystic Aquarium, which has many indoor
exhibits and shows, and we spent a half-day at historic Mystic
Seaport.
</P>
<P>
   We also explored some of the other beach communities surrounding
Misquamicut in Rhode Island. Take Route 1 north about 25 miles to
Narragansett, a quiet little town that also was once a resort for
the very wealthy at the turn of the last century. The town once
featured the Narragansett Pier Casino, which offered bowling,
billiards, tennis, a rifle gallery, a theater and a ballroom. The
casino burned down in 1900; only the towers that marked its
entrance remain. The beach at Narragansett is lovely and you can
stroll along a boardwalk for views of the ocean and several large
hotels near the beach.
</P>
<P>
   On the way to Narragansett, we stopped at the South County
Museum for a picnic lunch on the museum grounds and a tour of
reconstructions of several typical New England buildings, including
a cooper's shop and blacksmith's shop. A museum building houses
such exhibits as a general store and children's nursery. The museum
is small and isn't much different from other such historic
reconstructions (it pales greatly in comparison to Mystic Seaport
and the Farmers Museum in Cooperstown, N.Y.), but it's enough to
offer some diversion to small children.
</P>
<P>
   On the way back to Misquamicut, we drove down Route 1A through
Galilee to check out the beaches there. Roger W. Wheeler State
Beach had a children's playground. Galilee is a busy, working
fishing port and the site of the only year-round ferry to Block
Island.
</P>
<P>
   Closer to our home base in Misquamicut, we went several times to
the village of Watch Hill, just 4 miles away, for a small taste of
Newport.
</P>
<P>
   Watch Hill has a beautiful marina, gracious mansions, a lovely
beach (where the waves seemed to be calmer than at Misquamicut) and
several blocks of shops and restaurants. There wasn't much to do in
Misquamicut in the evenings other than take in the Atlantic Beach
Park amusement center with its handful of rides and nearby
miniature golf course, but, in Watch Hill, you could buy an ice
cream cone and stroll along the marina, check out the shops
offering clothes, crafts, jewelry and used books, and watch the
sunset from a gazebo.
</P>
<P>
   Near the beach, you won't want to miss the Flying Horse
Carousel, the oldest carousel in the United States, built in 1867.
Each horse, which will swing out when the carousel is in motion, is
hand carved from a single piece of wood and has a real horsehair
mane and leather saddle.
</P>
<P>
   Rides, which cost $1 each, are for children only.
</P>
<P>
   There are a just a few small hotels in Watch Hill, plus a grand
old Victorian hotel, the Ocean House, on a bluff overlooking the
ocean and a private beach. There are many condos for rent along the
waterfront, as well as numerous summer cottages.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the whole South County region seemed more geared toward
vacationers staying in rented cottages and seeking quiet and
solitude than toward those who selected a hotel or motel.
Misquamicut, in particular, seems to be a resort that didn't plan
on being a resort.
</P>
<P>
   There are only a handful of restaurants including a McDonald's,
Burger King and a Friendly's within a few miles driving distance.
Finer dining was even harder to seek out.
</P>
<P>
   We did have an excellent seafood dinner at a fine restaurant a
few miles away on Route 1 in Charlestown and we found a wonderful
neighborhood Italian restaurant in Misquamicut that was recommended
by the owner of our hotel.
</P>
<P>
   We also enjoyed dinner one evening in Watch Hill's Olympia Tea
Room, an old-fashioned restaurant with wooden booths, ceiling fans,
and an early 1900s soda fountain counter.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, we packed picnic lunches with food bought at a nearby
grocery store and enjoyed the two barbecue dinners poolside at our
hotel.
</P>
<P>
   While our hotel was very nice and I would highly recommend it,
we would be more likely to look into rental cottages for any return
to Misquamicut or check out a more romantic stay at the majestic
Ocean House in Watch Hill.

<P>
   NEWPORT, R.I. _ When he famously baptized a Wimbledon umpire as
``the pits of the world!'' was John Patrick McEnroe Jr. making a
geological classification? Or was it just another tempestuous
statement in his fashion of disapproving the judiciary while also
unnerving those who disapproved of his conduct?
</P>
<P>
   Many were they who fumed about his fuming, the tactless,
tasteless _ sometimes tactical _ tirades. Yet who could resist his
artistry and competitive verve with a tennis racket? All was
forgiven this lefthander because his distinctive sinister style,
the whirling dervish volleying and balletic footwork, was
mesmerizing. You cannot be serious if you believe McEnroe is
undeserving of canonization and a place among the greats Saturday
at the International Tennis Hall of Fame. Saints have had flaws,
too.
</P>
<P>
   Accompanying McEnroe in the Class of '99 at Newport's Casino,
the cradle of the American tournament game, is Ken McGregor, a
husky Australian of similar serve-and-volley persuasion, but
entirely dissimilar temperament. As the Aussie-US Davis Cup
collision looms next weekend at Longwood, it seems appropriate that
two such mainstays of the most compelling Cup rivalry should enter
the Hall together.
</P>
<P>
   McGregor, 70, who comes from Adelaide, was a vital cog in the
Australian Cup renaissance of 1950, alongside Frank Sedgman, his
predecessor to the Hall in 1979. They won three straight, breaking
a US stranglehold and launching their country's reign of terror: 15
Cups in 18 years. McEnroe, 40, also led a revival, sparking five
winners between 1978 and 1992, and bagged seven major singles: four
US, three Wimbledons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I acted up, and was out of line many times, no question,''
McEnroe says. ``But I don't think I was any worse than Ilie Nastase
or Jimmy Connors. It was a time for acting up _ but we could back
it up with solid playing. I hope I'm remembered more for my
playing.''
</P>
<P>
   He will be. Mac did it all, racking up a professional record of
154 career titles, a 77-77 singles-doubles split. He doesn't
understand why today's top guys don't play doubles _ ``it's great
fun.'' Nor does McGregor, who, with Sedgman, crafted the only men's
doubles Grand Slam in 1951.
</P>
<P>
   During one of his monster seasons, 1979, Mac won 27 titles, 10
in singles, plus all nine matches as the US took the Davis Cup.
``My mother made me promise I'd play Davis Cup if I was invited,''
he says, unsympathetic to decliners, as Pete Sampras has been.
</P>
<P>
   Scheduling sometimes made it tougher. In 1979 McEnroe won a
Monday night indoor singles final in San Francisco, rushed to the
airport with a police escort to make the midnight flight to Sydney
for a Cup semifinal. Jet lagged but jumping, he had one day's
practice on grass, then beat both Aussie foes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm best remembered for a match I lost,'' he laughs.
``People are always saying to me they remember my Wimbledon final
against Bjorn Borg. I know what they mean, but I say, `You mean '81
when I beat him?'
</P>
<P>
   ``No, no. They mean '80 and the long tiebreaker'' _ Borg's last
of five straight championships, the colossal 1-6, 7-5, 6-3, 6-7
(16-18), 8-6, decision. ``That was a lesson for me. I always
thought winning was so important but I came to realize that match,
just being part of such a wonderful match, elevated my stature,
enhanced my career more than winning. It made me a little humble _
not that I'm very humble.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Bjorn quit, only 25, I lost something. I was in shock. It
bothered me for a long time. We had a great rivalry.'' Even though
it was probably his ascent past Borg to No. 1 that drove the Swede
away, McEnroe says, ``I was affected negatively.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first major, the US in 1979, was bittersweet. I beat my
buddy Vitas Gerulaitis. There we were, two New York kids who grew
up 15 minutes from Flushing in the final. When would that ever
happen again? We were thrilled, but people booed us because the
final they wanted was Borg and Connors. I'd beaten Jimmy and Vitas
beat Roscoe Tanner, who beat Borg.
</P>
<P>
   ``It meant a lot to me to repeat in 1980, to show that my title
the year before wasn't a fluke _ and also what I had to do to win.
I beat Ivan Lendl in the quarters, four sets. The next day, Friday,
Peter (Fleming) and I lost the doubles final to Stan Smith and Bob
Lutz in five. Saturday a tiebreaker in the fifth to beat Connors at
night, four hours-plus. The next day five more sets and four more
hours to beat Borg for the title.''
</P>
<P>
   Eight years ago Mac swooped and swatted across the Casino lawn
in spearheading a Davis Cup victory over Spain. But Saturday he'll
be out of action, standing still to accept the induction encomiums
draped on him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm forcing all my kids to be here,'' he grins. ``Maybe
they'll remember it. Ava will enjoy it the most, sleeping. She's 3
months old.''
</P>
<P>
   The favored Americans thought Aussie captain Harry Hopman was
asleep when he selected rookie McGregor to start against them in
the 1950 final at Forest Hills in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could see them smiling when my name was announced at the
draw,'' says McGregor. ``Their happiness was understandable. Who
was I? But Sedgman gave us a 1-0 lead over Tom Brown, and I started
fast to beat Ted Schroeder.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That did us in,'' US captain Alrick Man said at the time.
``Ted had never lost a Cup match, and we needed him to win.''
</P>
<P>
   McGregor last appeared at Newport in 1952, losing the final to
Sedgman, whom he'd defeated for the Australian title. ``We were
amateurs then, playing for a few shillings expenses a day,'' he
recalls. ``Sedgman and I turned pro after winning the 1952 Cup. He
got a $75,000 guarantee. I got $25,000. We thought we were rich.''
They were. You couldn't buy the experiences that line the path to
the Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Rich, too, is McEnroe, the volcanic virtuoso at the crest of
many peaks, but not always avoiding the pits of the world.
</P>
<P>
   The latest pitfall was being stood up by Steffi Graf at
Wimbledon, where they were in the semis of the mixed with a good
shot at winning it. A last major title 20 years after the first
(the French mixed of 1977 with Mary Carillo), would have been a
sweet full-circle closer of his days at the Big W.
</P>
<P>
   But the fraulein said ``nein'' to playing more than the singles
final, which she lost to Lindsay Davenport. ``She promised me she
wouldn't pull out, but she did,'' says McEnroe, who may have
pleaded, ``You cannot be serious!''
</P>
<P>
   He's not the first guy to be jilted, but perhaps the Hall of
Fame is some consolation for being stiffed by Steffi.

A DRIVE ALONG THE `KANC' LEADS TO A LAND OF DISCOVERY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By FRED STETSON  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONWAY, N.H. _ With a whir of wings, a partridge explodes from
waist-deep snow and flies on a line through evergreens and
hardwoods. Seconds later, another lifts off and darts up the gully,
passing gray boulders half as tall as the trees. One partridge
leaves meandering tracks in the snow.
</P>
<P>
   But, the prints stop where the frightened bird took flight. This
moment occurred in the New Hampshire woods, a short walk from a
34-mile scenic highway that twists and turns through the White
Mountain National Forest. From the east, the two-lane road climbs
to almost 3,000 feet, then descends past swift, clear rivers, and
cuts through deep forests and jagged cliffs. Finally, it stops near
a tourist-driven town plastered with hokum.
</P>
<P>
   This is the ``Kanc.'' The east-west highway carries the name of
Kancamagus (Fearless One), who assumed leadership of the Penacook
(Native-American) Confederacy in 1681. Defeated in bloody wars,
Kancamagus and his followers retreated to northern New Hampshire
and Canada in 1691. They left behind a mountainous region filled
with history and lore. Since the early 1800s, such eminent artists
as Thomas Cole and Alfred Bierstadt have celebrated the White
Mountains. Visiting writers included Henry Thoreau, Ralph Waldo
Emerson and Nathaniel Hawthorne.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't until 1959 that highway crews finally blasted
through the rocky terrain and completed the Kanc, linking Lincoln
and Conway, 34 miles to the east. Today, the Kancamagus Highway is
part of a 123-mile New Hampshire ``Scenic and Cultural Byway.''
</P>
<P>
   This loop connects several routes and passes through thousands
of acres of forests, by scenic rivers and waterfalls, between
Crawford and Franconia Notches and by historic homes, inns and
villages. The byway even leads to the grand old Mount Washington
Hotel and the coal-fired Cog Railway locomotive that belches black
smoke as it chugs up the mountain. From many vantage points,
Washington's broad 6,288-foot summit slumbers on the far horizon.
</P>
<P>
   On warm, hazy afternoons, the mountain becomes faint and
mysterious, assuming a beauty found in landscape scenes from
ancient Japan. Most years, snow crowns the summit in late September
and lasts until May or June. Weather changes in a flash. In late
winter, skies above the Mount Washington Valley turned, in 72
hours, from cobalt blue, to hazy white, to battleship gray and then
coal black. At dusk, wind-driven clouds spun off nearby hills.
Sunlight, adding the drama of a Renaissance painting, beamed
through a pastel-blue hole in the overcast. Edges of gray clouds
turned sulfur yellow and soft pink, the color of the inside of a
conch shell.
</P>
<P>
   We began our trip at Woodsville, N.H. A mile east of Woodsville,
is New Hampshire Route 112, which, about 15 miles farther east in
Lincoln, becomes the Kancamagus Highway.
</P>
<P>
   Before turning onto Route 112, though, go a mile farther to the
pleasant town of Bath. In the village, beside a 400-foot-long
covered bridge, is the rustic and handsome Brick Store (1824), the
nation's ``oldest continuously operating general store.'' Dozens of
old Life magazines hang from upper walls, penny candy fills counter
jars, pastries and fudge sit under glass. Floors gleam with polish,
and porch floor boards, painted gray, have a comforting mix of wear
and grit. Another mile to the east is the so-called Upper Village
(located on a flood plain of the Ammonoosuc River), where Jeremiah
Hutchins and other pioneer settlers built a cluster of brick
Colonial homes.
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, the settlement looks as though someone moved a
neighborhood from Boston's Beacon Hill or Washington's Georgetown
to northern rural New Hampshire. The distinctive, Federal-style Ira
Goodhall House (1816) has a rare rounded brick wall facing the
street. After returning to Route 112, motorists begin a slight
climb, while winding along the Wild Ammonoosuc River.
</P>
<P>
   One of many Native-American names in the region, Ammonoosuc
means ``fish place.'' (The U.S. Forest Service says there are 750
miles of fishing streams and 50 ponds in the 800,000-acre White
Mountain National Forest.) While driving more than 50 feet from the
banks, car passengers can see the river bottom. Clear, shallow
water refracts the sand and rock.
</P>
<P>
   Once through Swiftwater, which has its own 150-year-old,
174-foot-long covered bridge, the highway climbs eight miles to
Beaver Pond. En route, sharp curves and frost heaves may toss a car
about, especially one with worn shocks. About 35 to 45 mph is a
comfortable speed. Overhead, trees such as hemlocks, pines and
birches create tunnels of shade.
</P>
<P>
   In summer, cool, evergreen-scented air spills down slope a
fresh, aromatic tonic. Before long, the trees give way to the
Beaver Pond overlook with 180-degree southerly views. Mount Blue,
Mount Moosilauke (``bald place'') and Mount Jim all more than 4,000
feet rise in the distance.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, brisk winds swirl down from the mountain ridges and
churn up small, but powerful cyclones of snow or spray. Like
imaginary tops, these spin across the pond. The Appalachian Trail,
a 2,000-mile trek from Georgia to Maine, passes nearby. Also, just
to the east of the Beaver Pond, are Lost River, a self-guided tour
through a scenic gorge at Kinsman Notch, and the ``Monkey Ledges,''
a series of outcroppings with pale-brown profiles similar to rhesus
monkeys.
</P>
<P>
   From the pond, Route 112 descends into North Woodstock. On the
south side of the road, immediately east of I-93, is the White
Mountain Visitors Information Center. Here, Dick Hamilton, a
multitalented booster known locally as ``Mr. White Mountains,'' has
an office filled with memorabilia watercolor and oil landscape
paintings, hotel post cards and dinnerware, historic books,
pamphlets and posters, and eclectic items such as an intricate,
hand-carved walking stick.

TRADITIONAL INVESTMENT MIX SHOULD PRODUCE FOR LONG-TERM INVESTOR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, July 11, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I am a 59-year-old male with no outstanding debts other than
a mortgage which will be paid off in four and a half years. I have
$350,000 in a SEP-IRA with $300,000 invested with Vanguard and the
remainder in MFS Total Return fund. At age 62 I plan to access
Social Security as well as to earn approximately $9,500 a year. My
wife is 10 years younger than me and has her own retirement plan. I
would like to withdraw 7 percent a year from the SEP, figuring that
if I have $400,000 in the account by age 62 it will produce
$28,000. With $12,000 from Social Security and $9,500 from my
earnings, this will give me $49,500 annual income. Do you have any
suggestions on the mix of my investments, considering inflation and
the possibility of need until age 90?
</P>
<P>
   E. R., Brookline, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. I'm not enthusiastic about this plan, but I do think you can
get within striking distance of your objective. Basically, what
you're proposing to do it establish a withdrawal plan that calls in
part upon stock market gains to support the income stream. I
calculate that the portfolio works out to about one third stocks,
with the balance in conservative fixed-income holdings such as
Vanguard GNMA, Short-Term Bond Index, Admiral Treasury Money
Market, and Intermediate-Term Treasury funds. This is a fairly
traditional mix for a person of your age, albeit a bit conservative
for my taste. The idea behind such a traditional portfolio is that
the fixed-income holdings will provide an income stream and the
stock portfolio will be left alone to produce growth of principal,
which will be called upon later in your retirement to offset the
effects of inflation.
</P>
<P>
   That all works out neatly enough, but when you set a withdrawal
schedule that exceeds the predictable yields of the fixed-income
side of the portfolio, you're doing two things I don't like. One is
that by pulling down some of the capital gains from the stock side,
you are hindering the ability of that part of the portfolio to do
its inflation-protecting job. Second, when you rely on growth of
stocks to support your plan, you put yourself in a position where
it's possible that a few bad market years could seriously upset
your apple cart.
</P>
<P>
   On the more positive side, it seems to me that you've made some
very moderate projections of portfolio growth from now until your
retirement age. Growth if the account from $350,000 to $400,000
over three years would represent a total return of only 4.55
percent a year; if you achieved average returns of 7 percent, the
pool would reach $428,765. And if you were to make one portfolio
more I am going to suggest _ swapping the money market fund for
shares of Vanguard High-Yield Corporate Bond fund _ the chances are
that returns and the accumulation would be even higher still.
</P>
<P>
   Besides swapping the money market fund for the junk bond fund, I
suggest that you do everything you can to build the fixed-income
side of the portfolio previous to your retirement. If you not only
reinvested all distributions from the bond funds on the
fixed-income side, but also thus invested the yield (but not
capital gains distributions) from the stock funds in one of your
middle-of-the-road bond funds, such as the GNMA offering, you might
anticipate that you would have nearly $290,000 in fixed-income
investments by the time you retire. (That calculation presumes a
6.5 percent average yield from your fixed-income portfolio side and
income distributions of 1.5 percent from your stock funds.) The
projected $290,000 pool could then be counted on to bring you an
$18,500 annual income stream, which puts you $9,500 a year under
your income projection.
</P>
<P>
   What's the answer? The only things I can suggest are probably
both going to look fairly painful to you. One is to save like mad
during your final working years, doing everything you can to build
that fixed-income portfolio as close as you can to the $400,000
that will fulfill your income stream while leaving the stock
portfolio aside for pure growth. The second, probably still more
unpleasant, is to re-budget for your retirement, cutting back on
your anticipated expenses to the point that they match the
anticipated yield from your fixed-income portfolio and your other
resources.
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am a 45-year-old woman who just came to this country two
months ago because of economic needs. I really don't know where I
can start with my savings. I will earn approximately $12,000 a
year. I already know this is no money, but I want to invest at
least $50 monthly in a fund _ but how?
</P>
<P>
   A.M., Downey, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   A. I applaud your resolution to get off to a good start, but I
think you may be preparing to move too quickly. Before you begin
investing in the kind of mutual funds which have the prospect for
strong long-term growth, you want to establish a sizable pool of
liquid savings.
</P>
<P>
   So my suggestion is to begin at your local bank with a simple
savings account, plugging away for the next 38 months until you
have amassed $2,000. At that point, I would suggest that you split
the pool, leaving half of it in the bank and putting the other half
in a fund which simply seeks to duplicate the results of the
nation's 1000 largest publicly-owned companies. Such a fund is
Schwab 1000 Investor Shares. You can get information on the fund by
simply calling one of Schwab's almost omnipresent brokerage
outlets, or by calling the firm at 1-800-435-4000. After you've
established the initial position, I suggest you then continue to
divide your ongoing savings evenly between the bank and the mutual
fund.
</P>
<P>
   During the rather long delay before you get to experience the
fun and satisfaction of investing proper, there are two things to
do _ one is to mail for information about the fund, including a
prospectus and an annual report, and study these carefully until
you're fully satisfied that you understand what you would be buying
and the risks that go with the investment. Equally important is my
second suggestion. Take a few sheets of notepaper and note down the
share price of your intended fund, obtaining the figures once a
week from the mutual fund reports in the newspapers. Then play a
little game, based on your weekly salary.
</P>
<P>
   For example, if you spent all of one week's earnings on Schwab
1000 shares at current prices, you could buy about six fund shares.
So when you begin this game, multiply the share figure from the
paper times six and watch how the account would grow (or shrink) as
the market changes. If you follow this discipline for many months,
it should give you a pretty realistic idea of what to expect from
such an investment, and it will also teach you the effect that
capital gains and income distributions has on a fund portfolio. And
by the time that the 38 months of saving is up, it will also give
you a pretty good idea whether you are willing to commit your
hard-earned money to the uncertainties of the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have accumulated a stock portfolio over the years and would
like to give some of it to my children. They intend to hold the
stock for their children's education. What is the cost basis of the
receiver of annual gifts of stock worth $10,000? I have been
receiving different advice about this.
</P>
<P>
   H.B., Bethlehem , Pa.
</P>
<P>
   A. According to my favorite tax guide, the one pout out by J. K.
Lasser each year and now resembling the Manhattan telephone
directory, if the fair market value of the property equaled or
exceeded the donor's adjusted base cost at the time you received
the gift, your basis for figuring the gain or loss is the donor's
adjusted basis. If on the date of the gift the fair market value
was less than the donor's adjusted basis, your basis for figuring
gain is the donor's adjusted basis, and your basis for figuring
loss is the fair market value. There are additional provisions
which relate to gift taxes, but since you plan to keep your gifts
at $10,000 or less, they won't apply to the transaction you
propose.

 CONWAY, N.H.: x x x walking stick.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Once past North Woodstock, the highway continues through
Lincoln, then becomes the Kancamagus and begins a gradual easterly
climb beside the East Branch of the Pemigewasset (``swift
current'') River. Years ago, this part of the route served as
bedding for railroads that carried millions of feet of timber from
the forests.
</P>
<P>
   Near Loon Mountain in Lincoln sits an old black locomotive once
owned by the region's notorious lumber baron, J.E. Henry. Some of
his critics called him a ``butcher.'' But nowadays, 50 years after
the trains shut down, few signs remain along the Kanc of past
forest devastation. Sparkling streams, roadside trees and yellow
``moose crossing'' signs suggest that nature is reclaiming the
woods.
</P>
<P>
   From higher ground, though, for example, from atop 2,530-foot
Hedgehog Mountain, scars of past clear cutting become visible. Only
five miles east of Lincoln, with its ski slopes and acres of
apartment-like condominiums, the Kanc crosses a beautiful, scenic
stretch of the Pemigewasset's East Branch. A few hundred yards
north of the highway bridge, a graceful, narrow footbridge also
crosses this 160-foot-wide expanse. White-barked paper birches with
branches like filigrees line both sides of the highway. Hidden in
the nearby woods are parking lots, hiking trails to Franconia
Falls, and the Forest Service's Lincoln Woods Center, a sturdy,
rustic log cabin.
</P>
<P>
   This center, along with the Saco Ranger Station 30 miles to the
east in Conway, provides information and rules on camping, fishing,
swimming and hiking in the White Mountain National Forest.
</P>
<P>
   If you stop for extended periods along the Kanc, you must pay a
$5 parking fee. Also, don't feed the bears. Lincoln Woods hikers
may encounter abandoned campsites or other signs of past logging
and railroad activities. These include logging roads, ice ponds,
bridge abutments, old dumps, abandoned rails, railroad ties and
ironware. ``Removing any artifact,'' the Forest Service warns, ``is
strictly prohibited.''
</P>
<P>
   Trails continue past Franconia Falls and go deep into the
Pemigewasset Wilderness, all the way to The Cliffs and Mount Bond.
This is a long hike about 20 miles round trip. But, at least half
the en route terrain is near-level railroad bed.
</P>
<P>
   From Lincoln Woods, the Kanc climbs east-southeast for about
four miles, then reaches two sharp, hair-pin turns and three
overlooks. To the south, Mount Osceola (a Seminole chief's name,
``black drink''), Mount Kancamagus and other peaks form a back-lit,
3,000- to 4,000-foot-high mountain curtain. A nearby trail leads to
Lower and Upper Greeley Ponds. The latter, surrounded by tall
cliffs and old-growth timber, has an aqua-green color. Both offer
trout fishing.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Doan, author of ``Fifty Hikes in the White Mountains,''
recommends Upper Greeley Pond as a summer picnic site. ``Spruces
and pointed firs rise toward the cliff and reflect in the still
water,'' he writes. ``Speckled trout break the surface to suck down
hatchling flies. Juncos and white-throated sparrows call from the
trees. Cedar waxwings flutter over the pond to catch bugs, then
return to a branch alongshore and preen their glossy feathers.
...''
</P>
<P>
   Not far from Greeley Ponds parking lot, the highway reaches its
highest point, 2,855 feet, and cuts through a beige-colored
outcropping at Kancamagus Pass. Again, the high terrain offers
magnificent, unobstructed views, this time looking east to carpets
of trees in the valley below.
</P>
<P>
   From here, the Kanc descends beside the Swift River, another
clear, sand-bottom stream, strewn with rocks and boulders and lined
with trees. Historic covered bridges cross the river in Albany and
Conway. About five miles east of the pass is Sabbaday Falls picnic
area and an easy 30- to 40-minute walk to the falls. A gentle,
introductory hike inclines along a small stream and arrives at a
shaded pool, perhaps 40 to 50 feet across, with a sheer
30-foot-high wall or cliff at the south end. Hemlock trees, with
drooping green branches and cinnamon-brown bark and cones, line the
pathway.
</P>
<P>
   Prepared steps and wooden railings allow safe walking inches
from the flumes.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby is the Russell-Colbath House, a 167-year-old home that
carries one of the most poignant tales of the White Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   One night, in 1891, Ruth Priscilla Colbath's husband told her
he'd be back ``in a little while.'' Taking him at his word, she
left a lantern in the window, thinking he'd come around the bend
any time and the light would guide him home. With the faith of an
apostle, Mrs. Colbath lighted her lamp night after night, year
after year. Finally, after gallivanting about Cuba, Panama,
California and other warm-weather locales while his wife shivered
in New Hampshire, Tom Colbath returned to the small cape in
Passaconaway.
</P>
<P>
   As the headline in the Sept. 29, 1932, Boston Herald said, he
was a bit late: ``Man Returns After 42 Years to Find Home Empty;
Wife Who Lighted Window Every Night Dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Colbath, after celebrating her 80th birthday alone, had
died three years earlier. Thinking her husband had died long
before, her relatives had divided up and distributed his estate. In
summer months, travelers can stop and visit the classic old cape
with its center chimney, shingled roof and small-pane windows that
overlook the wild and woolly Kanc.

SINGING THE PRAISES OF MIDWEST HOSPITALITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Airports are crowded; seats in coach are cramped; airline
food, if you get any at all, is terrible. Things are so bad that
Congress and passengers forced the air line industry last month to
acknowledge that passengers should be treated with more respect.
</P>
<P>
   What's an angry, frustrated traveler to do?
</P>
<P>
   For some, the answer is simple: Fly Midwest Express.
</P>
<P>
   In an era in which airlines are trying to eke out every dollar
they can, Milwaukee-based Midwest Express puts all of its
passengers into first-class-size leather seats aboard its DC-9s and
MD-80s at coach prices, and spends almost $10 per passenger, or
twice the industry average, on meals that are served on china with
linen napkins. In doing so, it has consistently turned a tidy
profit _ $36 million in earnings in 1998 on operating revenues of
$389 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Midwest Express difference was readily apparent on Flight
202 from Boston to Milwaukee last Saturday morning. The choices for
breakfast were a stunning fruit plate with fresh stawberries and
pineapple and cereal, or, for the bigger appetites, a cheese
omelette with sausage plus a fruit cup, yogurt and granola, and a
corn muffin. And complimentary champagne flowed as freely as the
coffee. On lunch and dinner flights, red or white wine also is
free.
</P>
<P>
   The flight was an hour late taking off _ but the ticket agent
gave a detailed reason why, without even being asked: a lightning
strike that knocked out air traffic control computers had meant
delays into Logan the night before. As a result, the flight crew
could not fly as soon as scheduled because of mandated rest
periods.
</P>
<P>
   While Midwest Express's regular and advance-purchase discounted
fares are competitive, the airline does not offer the range of
destinations major airlines do. So if passengers want to fly from
Boston to Seattle or Honolulu, they can't do it on Midwest Express.
And if they want to fly nonstop anywhere but Milwaukee or Kansas
City from Boston, they also have to pick another airline. But by
changing planes at Milwaukee's uncrowded airport, they can go on to
cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, or Orlando. Other
connections to San Francisco, Tamp, Ft. Lauderdale, and Ft. Myers
are seasonal.
</P>
<P>
   Although it flew only 1.9 million passengers last year _ a
minuscule number compared with US Airways' 58 million passengers _
Midwest Express has developed a loyal following.
</P>
<P>
   Jan Morris, a production director for Atlantic Monthly, says she
``rejoiced'' when a Wisconsin printing company won a contract with
her magazine, because it meant she would end up flying Midwest
Express frequently.
</P>
<P>
   ``The seats are wide; they are always very polite to you; and
the food is so different,'' said Morris on a recent flight into
Boston. ``It is such a different and pleasant experience.''
</P>
<P>
   On most flights, the cabin takes on the aroma of a bakery as
chocolate chip cookies _ still warm from an on-board oven _ are
passed out for dessert.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite simply,'' said Morris, as a flight attendant passed out
some gooey cookies as the DC-9 flew 32,000 feet above Michigan
farmland, ``this is the best domestic airline experience there
is.''
</P>
<P>
   Morris is not alone in crying Midwest's praises in the wild blue
yonder.
</P>
<P>
   For the past seven years Consumer Reports has rated the airline
tops in customer satisfaction. The Zagat Airline Survey recently
ranked Midwest Express the best domestic airline and the fourth
best in the world _ the first time a US airline has cracked the top
10.
</P>
<P>
   Midwest Express was born in the era of deregulation, an offshoot
of the corporate airline of Kimberly-Clark Corp., the tissue paper
and personal care products giant.
</P>
<P>
   Starting out as corporate aviation service, to carrry
Kimberly-Clark employees to far-flung paper mills, enabled Midwest
Express to focus on service, said Timothy E. Hoeksema, Midwest's
chairman and once the chief pilot for Kimberly-Clark.
</P>
<P>
   ``As Kimberly-Clark, we were very frustrated after airline
deregulation (in 1978),'' said Hoeksema in a telephone interview.
``In the early 1980s, it proved very difficult to get around. We
thought if we were frustrated, other business people must be
frustrated too. . . . We had a chance to learn what business
travelers really want.''
</P>
<P>
   One thing the airline did was focus on cities that bigger
airlines ignored. It avoided routes already crowded by several
airlines. For example, Midwest Express's hubs are in Milwaukee and
Omaha, not the top tier of American cities. Nor can you fly on
Midwest along the East Coast Boston-New York-Washington corridor _
one of the busiest air markets in the world _ unless you fly
through Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   Midwest Express fares and discounts are competitive with those
of most major carriers. And if you are paying full fare for your
coach ticket, the airline seems like a bargain because of the size
of its seats and the quality of the service.
</P>
<P>
   Unrestricted round-trip coach fares from Boston to Milwaukee are
$861 on Midwest and $990 on Delta. Advanced purchase with a
Saturday night stay is $279 on Midwest and $297 on Delta. An
unrestricted roundtrip coach ticket from Boston to Los Angeles
costs $2,070 on United, which flies nonstop. On Midwest, which
requires a change of flights, the unrestricted fare is $1,258.50.
The cheapest Boston-Los Angeles roundtrip fare on United is $528.
On Midwest it is $685.
</P>
<P>
   ``In general, you get what you pay for in life, and customers
aren't willing to pay much more for service. But if all things are
equal, you will take the airline that has better service,'' said
Glenn D. Engel, an airline analyst with Goldman Sachs &AMP; Co. ``If
everyone tried to improve their service, they would have some
trouble, but (Midwest is) doing something different, by offering
great service and matching the price.''
</P>
<P>
   Midwest began operations in June 1984 and Boston-Milwaukee was
one of its first routes. The airline has been profitable since its
second year; even during the disastrous early 1990s, when the
airline industry collectively lost $13 billion, Midwest continued
to make money.
</P>
<P>
   Only one other airline was profitable during that time as well _
no-frills Southwest Airlines. But while Midwest Express spent an
average of $9.87 on each passenger's food and beverages last year,
Southwest Airlines, spent an average of 20 cents, according to
AVITAS, an aviation consulting company.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan Solomon, 21, flies Midwest Express four or five times a
year because he is a senior at the University of Wisconsin. Two
years ago, he bought some Midwest stock. ``You are supposed to buy
what you know and all my friends fly it and we love it. They just
made you feel like you were in their home,'' said Solomon. ``I
didn't want to get off, and now I look forward to flying rather
than dreading it.''
</P>
<P>
   The value of Solomon's stock has doubled. And since the company
went public nearly four years ago, the stock price has quadrupled.
Goldman Sachs analyst Engel thinks the run up is not over. Last
month he issued a ``buy'' recommendation on Midwest Express stock,
in part because business travel is expected to increase. Midwest
Express shares closed Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange at 31
7/8, down 9/16.
</P>
<P>
   About 55 percent of all Midwest Express passengers are business
travelers, while the ratio for the rest of the industry is less
than 50 percent. By attracting a larger percentage of business
travelers than other carriers, even at competitively priced fares,
the airline says its revenue yields are 30 percent to 40 percent
higher than the industry average.
</P>
<P>
   Midwest plans to expand.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have had 20 percent compounded annual growth and we are
committed to double digit _ 12 to 16 percent _ capacity growth, but
I am not smart enough to grow at 50 percent a year and maintain our
culture,'' said Hoeksema. ``If we brought too many new people on at
once it would hurt our culture. . . . We try to treat every
customer as if they were a guest in our home.''
</P>
<P>
   To maintain its service-oriented culture, Midwest Express fills
anywhere from 30 percent to 50 percent of positions on new routes
with employees experienced with the airline. ``It is a very
important formula to transfer the culture there,'' said Hoeksema.
The airline is looking to develop a third hub somewhere in the US
by the end of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   One cost Midwest Express tries to keep down is aircraft
acquisition. Indeed, by buying only used planes, it has one of the
oldest fleets in the industry. But the planes it buys have
relatively few takeoff-and-landing cycles on them. Manufacturer
recommendations call for DC-9s to be retired after 110,000 cycles.
Midwest's fleet has an average of 50,000 cycles per plane, and its
schedule adds only 2,000 more per year.

   PORTLAND, Me. _ On a summer morning at the first light of dawn
in Portland, you can stand at harbor's edge and watch fishing boats
unload fresh catch onto docks, some to be distributed throughout
New England, some to be sold right in the town's own market.
</P>
<P>
   From its biggest cities like Portland, to its smallest villages,
like Bailey's Island, life in midcoast Maine hasn't changed all
that much over the years. Since the mid-1800s, when ``rusticators''
began coming north to enjoy Maine's bucolic summers, the state has
been a place to take refuge from the stress of everyday life. And
so, today, the fishing fleet in Portland's harbor shares its waters
with cruise ships, as many eastern seaboard cruise lines add
Portland to their ports of call.
</P>
<P>
   A convenient gateway to many Maine points, Portland is rapidly
becoming a destination of its own. It has been likened to San
Francisco and Seattle due to its urban blend of elegant
architecture, cultural offerings, gourmet restaurants and ethnic
pockets. The new Portland Public Market (modeled after Seattle's
Pike Place Market), a huge post-and-beam indoor farmer's market
with fish vendors, wine merchants, organic produce and coffee bars,
adds a further sheen of sophistication and livability to the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jewel by the sea,'' poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow called his
boyhood home of Portland. The city rises up on a hill overlooking
the shimmering water and islands of Casco Bay. Several fires
claimed many of Portland's early buildings, the last and most
devastating being the fire of July 4, 1866, when an Independence
Day firecracker severely damaged the city. But with wealth and
prosperity on its side, the city was rebuilt during the Victorian
era. Today, its well-preserved historic buildings reflect the
opulent, gracious style of the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
   The city's primarily brick edifices are complemented by
shingle-style homes designed by John Calvin Stevens, a prominent
architect and painter famous for his Mount Desert Island
millionaires' ``cottages.'' More grandiose is the Italianate-style
Victoria Mansion, on Danford Street at the corner of Park. The
palatial brownstone, commissioned by entrepreneur Ruggles Sylvester
Morse in the 1850s, features frescoed walls and ceilings, a flying
staircase, and other ornate embellishments.
</P>
<P>
   The Old Port Exchange is the city's gift to tourists and
residents alike. Although this district has been gentrified, it
hasn't been gussied up past the point of authenticity. The historic
buildings have been renovated, brick and cobblestone streets have
been preserved, and gas-lit lamps were added along several of the
sloping sidewalks.
</P>
<P>
   This is where you'll find the lion's share of specialty shops,
gourmet restaurants, endless variations of coffee bars, and a dozen
or so galleries and fine craft shops. It is purported that Portland
has the highest number of restaurant seats per capita in the
country; the truth of that statement is supported by almost
overwhelming dining choices facing visitors.
</P>
<P>
   There are microbreweries with stylish restaurants (some even
offer tours of their brewing facilities), traditional mainstays
like the Seaman's Club and DeMillo's Floating Restaurant, and
upmarket trendy spots. The bulk of all these are located in the Old
Port Exchange area (some 100), but you can easily get a good meal
in almost every corner of town.
</P>
<P>
   Within walking distance of the Old Port, the I.M. Pei-designed
Portland Museum of Art is noted for its impressive Winslow Homer
collection, and for its broad collection of American and
Impressionistic masters. Heading up the list of the city's cultural
institutions, the Merrill Auditorium is a huge draw. The principle
venue for the Portland Symphony as well as guest performers and
entertainers from around the world, the hall was renovated in 1997
to the tune of nearly $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   While Portland can easily fill a two-day visit, eventually the
mythic Maine coast will beg to be explored. From Portland, the
midcoast towns of Brunswick, Bath and Wiscasset are within a short
drive and supply all the charm of coastal New England villages and
a bounty of cultural enjoyments as well.
</P>
<P>
   Brunswick is the quintessential New England college town. The
main street, Maine Street, is said to be the widest in the state
(nine rods, if that helps!). Driving east down Maine Street _ which
is home to several of the town's better restaurants, cafes, a
natural-food store, boutiques and art galleries _ you come to the
town green, or the ``mall'' as it's called, a rectangle of lawn
that in the winter serves as a skating rink and in the summer hosts
a twice-weekly farmers market that draws locals from miles around.
</P>
<P>
   One block farther and you are on the grounds of gracious Bowdoin
College. Among Bowdoin alumni, Nathaniel Hawthorne and Henry
Wadsworth Longfellow are two of its more noted. Another graduate,
Robert Edwin Peary, was the first to reach the North Pole during
his Arctic expeditions with fellow Bowdoin alum Donald Baxter
MacMillan.
</P>
<P>
   Mementos from his expeditions, and a collection of other arctic
and Inuit artifacts, are well exhibited at the Peary-MacMillan
Arctic Museum in Hubbard Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, the Bowdoin College Museum of Art in the Walker Building
is considered to house one of New England's finest art collections.
During summer months, Brunswick's claim to fame is the Maine State
Music Theatre, an annual summer series showcasing big-name talent
in Bowdoin College's historic Pickard Theatre. Musical offerings
take place all summer long in Brunswick.
</P>
<P>
   There are weekly organ recitals at the historic First Parish
Church, an annual week-long jazz festival at Thomas Point Beach,
and a repertoire of musicians performing at the outdoor bandstand.
In addition to a well-endowed local historical museum, and a
substantial collection of well-preserved historic houses (one of
which, the Stowe House, now an inn, is where Harriett Beecher Stowe
lived while she penned ``Uncle Tom's Cabin''), Brunswick is well
steeped in New England history.

US NUCLEAR SCIENTISTS FEAR CURBS ON INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When India set off a nuclear test last year, the
State Department responded by blocking certain US physicists from
attending a conference in Bombay. Indian scientists were removed
from a project at Fermilab, the national physics lab near Chicago.
The Department of Energy even asked the lab to remove the Indian
flag from a multinational display at its main building.
</P>
<P>
   For the scientists involved, those were inconveniences. But now,
researchers are worried that international cooperation will suffer
even greater setbacks as Congress reacts to reports of alleged
nuclear spying by China.
</P>
<P>
   The National Academy of Sciences recently issued a statement of
``deep concern'' over the prospect of new legal restrictions on US
nuclear scientists working with their researchers overseas. The
academy plans a conference in August to highlight the benefits of
allowing certain types of joint research.
</P>
<P>
   When the board of the American Physical Society met last month
at Tanglewood, the discussion focused on whether Congress, in
trying to make US weapons labs more secure, would also hamper the
work of US scientists. ``We're busy worrying about it,'' said ob
Park of the physicists' group, who urged Congress not ``to
interfere with the very culture of openness that has given the US
the lead'' in sciences.
</P>
<P>
   And from the classrooms of Boston to universities on the West
Coast, scientists report a pervasive fear that Congress will limit
their contact with foreigners or otherwise damage the climate for
international projects. At Northeastern University, for example,
physicists worry that the frosty US-China relations will undermine
support for a multimillion-dollar particle accelerator that China
had shown tentative interest in building.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a massive contribution to world science, and it
worries me that it would die because of some political problem,''
said Stephen Reucroft, a physics professor at Northeastern.
</P>
<P>
   The fears underscore the way science is changing in the era of
the Internet and big-money projects. Increasingly, cutting-edge
research brings together top scientists from several nations _
partly because foreign science programs have improved and partly
because large projects, such as studying a global environmental
trend or building a large telescope, involve great cost and
complexity.
</P>
<P>
   The global cooperation shows up in the large increase in
scientific papers with authors from different nations. The number
of internationally co-authored articles jumped 200 percent between
1981 and 1995, the National Science Foundation reports, while the
total number of papers rose only 20 percent. Nearly one-third of
all US scientific papers included foreign co-authors in 1995, up
from 18 percent in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Longtime debate
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, debate has ebbed and flowed over the past 20
years on how much access foreigners should have to US universities
and labs. But the nation has generally supported the idea of
building ``high fences around narrow areas'' of sensitive research,
and of allowing broad access to the rest.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, Congress is considering new restrictions as it
sorts out how to respond to two reports on security problems at US
weapons and physics labs that are supervised by the Department of
Energy.
</P>
<P>
   The first report, from a panel led by Representative Christopher
Cox, Republican of California, alleged that the Chinese government
had stolen nuclear secrets from US weapons labs. The Cox report
also pointed to a problem in corporate work overseas, saying that
US satellite companies gave the Chinese information that allowed
them to improve their ballistic missiles.
</P>
<P>
   The second panel, created by President Clinton and led by former
US senator Warren Rudman, charged that the Energy Department is so
``dysfunctional'' that it cannot be trusted to improve security at
national labs. It urged Congress to restructure the agency.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese government reacted angrily to the Cox report and
denied any espionage. Relations deteriorated further after NATO
bombed the Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia, and China allowed unruly
protests at the US Embassy in Beijing. In Congress, some lawmakers
called for new restrictions on scientists not only from China, but
from Russia and other ``sensitive'' nations.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Little impact yet
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So far, the actual impact on scientists from the dust-up with
China seems to be little more than fear and injured morale. Some
foreign-born graduate students offered positions at Department of
Energy research labs have turned them down out of fear that their
ability to work will soon be restricted, said E. William
Colglazier, executive officer of the National Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   But as long as lawmakers continue to debate new restrictions,
scientists say they are uneasy. So are some foreign scientists
working on projects with US researchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have received e-mails from three Chinese organizations in
high-energy physics or other fields of physics, where the Chinese
are questioning whether the collaboration is still on,'' said
Wolfgang Panofsky, former director of the Stanford Linear
Accelerator Center in California.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists' fears turns on several developments in Congress:
</P>
<P>
   --Lawmakers in both the House and Senate have proposed a
moratorium on visits to the American nuclear research labs, or to
parts of those labs, by scientists from ``sensitive'' countries
such as China or Russia. One version of the idea has passed a House
committee and is attached to a major bill that will soon reach the
House floor.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists fear that this and similar restrictions would limit
scientific exchanges, which even some intelligence experts say is a
crucial element of cutting-edge science. ``In high-stakes research,
like nuclear weaponry, you have to have your guys not only develop
new concepts but get out and see what the top 100 or so people in
the world in the same area are doing,'' said Paul Moore, former
chief China counterintelligence analyst at the FBI. ``If you don't,
you are guaranteeing yourself a second-rate development program.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, some security specialists say that China and Russia
would retaliate if the United States put its nuclear labs
off-limits to their researchers. And that, they say, would hamper
US efforts to counsel foreign scientists on converting weapons labs
to civilian research and on protecting weapons-grade material so
that it cannot be stolen and sold on the black market.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's inevitable that there will be damage to these
forms of cooperation, and it's too bad, because they are very much
in the US's security interests,'' said John Holdren, a Harvard
University professor who leads the National Academy of Sciences
panel on international security and arms control.
</P>
<P>
   --The Rudman report recommended that Congress bring new security
oversight to nuclear research labs, either by creating a new,
independent security agency or a unit within the Energy Department.
</P>
<P>
   Some scientists fear that an independent weapons agency would
make it harder for weapons scientists to cross back and forth to
the world of civilian research. ``You're not going to get top
weapons scientists to work in a pure weapons environment,'' said
Park of the American Physical Society. Scientists who work on
classified research cannot publish their work and advance their
reputations, he said, so they would leave the weapons labs.
</P>
<P>
   --Among its 38 recommendations, the Cox report called for the
inspectors general at five agencies, including the departments of
State, Defense, and Energy, to study scientific exchange programs
at the US national laboratories for their risk to national
security.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find that absolutely outrageous recommendation,'' said
Panofsky. ``First, inspectors general are not particularly
qualified to review scientific exchange programs. And second,
whenever you want to find the correct course of action, you have to
look at benefits as well as risks.''
</P>
<P>
   For Boston, the ultimate fear is that lawmakers will revive an
effort, last considered during the Reagan administration, to limit
the type of scientific training that US universities may provide to
students from certain foreign nations. US universities award 40
percent of their doctorates in science and engineering fields to
foreign nationals. They included 16,500 from China between 1988 and
1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a valid concern, and I think it's something
people should be thinking about and worrying about as they spin out
the possibilities of the direction in which this could escalate,''
said Holdren.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's not an unrealistic fear to have, and I'm worried
about it,'' Colglazier said.
</P>
<P>
   But others say the fears are overblown. To begin with, China has
sent signals that it wants to repair relations with the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the Rudman report said it is possible to allow an open
exchange of most information while protecting the most sensitive
secrets. And Congress, after careful consideration, will come to
the same conclusion, said Michael Lubell, chairman of the physics
department at City College of New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cooler heads will prevail,'' said Lubell, who is also public
affairs chief for the American Physical Society. ``The issue won't
be as much the isolation of scientists as it will be whether the
Department of Energy can take action (to protect nuclear secrets)
when the need arises.''

 PORTLAND, Me.: x x x New England history.

   A historical walking-tour map can be picked up at the Pejepscot
Historical Society on Park Row. Brunswick is also the starting
point for a drive along the ``fingers'' that reach deep into Casco
Bay and bring you to nearby rustic fishing villages and seaside
summer colonies.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Shortly into the drive along Route 123 south past Bowdoin
College you might be surprised to see water on both sides; in
Brunswick it is easy to forget that you are in a coastal Maine
town, but now you're squarely in ``lobstah country.''
</P>
<P>
   Here you'll see lobster pots, lobster buoys, lobster boats and
yes, lobsters, too. You can buy them directly from the fishermen on
any number of docks. The ways and places to eat lobster are
seemingly endless here; The Dolphin Marina in South Harpswell is
one of the best (but don't miss out on its excellent fish chowder).
</P>
<P>
   Continue to drive along the coast through West Harpswell and
you'll wind up at Potts Point, a quaint resort community whose
summer residents inhabit colorful 19th-century cottages. It's also
worthwhile to stop and visit the studios of the islands' many
artists, most of which are attached to their homes.
</P>
<P>
   The Harpswell Craft Guild publishes a map to help visitors
locate their members; look for it at convenience stores and
libraries.
</P>
<P>
   Backtrack down Route 123 and in a couple of miles you'll see the
sign for Mountain Road, on your right. This road connects two
``fingers'' of the peninsula via a bridge. Follow signs on Route 24
for Bailey Island. This peninsula is distinguished by a unique
rustic granite block bridge connecting Bailey Island to Orr's
Island.
</P>
<P>
   The famous Cribstone Bridge is the only remaining one like it in
the world. Crossing the bridge, the view of Merriconeag Sound is
breathtaking, and the other bonus: You're in the midst of excellent
restaurants such as Cook's Lobster House, which you'll see just
across a boat-filled bay on the right. At the very end of this
peninsula, there's a small parking area adjacent to a gift shop and
a cluster of rocks known as Land's End. Explore the shore; it's
classic Maine.
</P>
<P>
   In less than an hour, you can drive from the snail's pace of
small island living to the hustle and bustle of an active seafaring
town that also owes its existence to its direct proximity to the
water. Once the cradle of a boisterous seafaring economy, Bath is
now considered the cradle of culture in the midcoast region, with
shipbuilding continuing to provide for a thriving economy thanks to
The Bath Iron Works, an active naval shipyard whose giant cranes
rise high over the waterfront.
</P>
<P>
   Like a typical seaport city, Bath's prosperity is reflected in
the impressive homes of its sea captains and merchants, who in the
mid-19th century erected grand Italianate, Georgian Revival and
Greek Revival mansions. Washington Street and North Street frame
the once well-to-do neighborhoods that hug the Kennebec River. Some
of the grand homes have remained private residences; others have
been converted to inns and lodging establishments.
</P>
<P>
   The town boasts some of the midcoast's nicest B&AMP;Bs. Along the
banks of the Kennebec River, the Maine Maritime Museum is an
extensive complex encompassing several museum buildings and the
Percy &AMP; Small Shipyard, the country's only surviving yard that
builds wooden ships.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1870 and 1890, Down Easters were the schooner of choice
for moving coal and other heavy loads by water. These schooners
were built in Bath, and the museum has a considerable collection of
artifacts and a research library. During the summer, the museum
offers river tours and boat rides, and several special-themed
weekends.
</P>
<P>
   Bath has actively fostered a reputation for being an arts center
over the years. In addition to a denizen of art galleries,
throughout the summer art shows are frequently held in the park in
front of the elegant town library. The centerpiece of the Bath arts
scene is the Chocolate Church, a converted Congregational Church,
where year-round plays, concerts and guest artists perform, most
often to sell-out crowds.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a gallery inside the brown board-and-batten
structure, named after its deep chocolate color.
</P>
<P>
   Crossing the Carlton Bridge over the Kennebec, Route 1 continues
on to a town that bills itself modestly as ``the prettiest village
in Maine'' _ Wiscasset. There is no argument that this quiet town
offers some of the prettiest houses, prettiest views and prettiest
stores you will ever see. Just before it reaches the Sheepscot
River, Route 1 passes through a picture-perfect village center.
</P>
<P>
   On one side, an upscale gourmet cheese and wine shop is tucked
in a narrow, country weathered storefront; and on the other a fine
antiques dealer caters to out-of-town visitors. Down the hill,
Red's Eats is practically a summertime institution. At lunch hour
there are lines for the fried clams and lobster rolls at this
bright-red take-out stand.
</P>
<P>
   Don't leave town without stopping at Castle Tucker, built in
1807 by a local judge for his wife. As if its stunning views of the
Sheepscot River weren't enough, the judge had the house built in
the elegant style of an aristocrat. The Victorian furnishings and
much of the wallpaper are original, but its free-standing
elliptical staircase gets most of the attention.
</P>
<P>
   Wiscasset like almost every sizable Maine village is ultimately
best explored on foot, or by bike. The ebb and flow of a Maine
seaside village is in the details that are too easily missed in a
drive-through visit. It is the fragrance of an untamed flower box,
the fog as it lifts off the shore at sunrise, or an impromptu
conversation with a Down Easterner, that create the memories you'll
take home with you.

CYCLISTS USE NET TO PROTEST   ADS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As BankBoston Corp. and ad agency Hill Holliday Connors
Cosmopulos have just found out, e-mail and on-line chat rooms can
make it easier for even a handful of folks to orchestrate protests
about ads they deem objectionable.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, a BankBoston TV ad that included footage of a
pregnant pedestrian dodging a bicycle messenger incited a mini flap
of sorts among some bike commuters who felt their preferred mode of
travel had been gratuitously maligned.
</P>
<P>
   Because the ad was near the end of a six-week run when
complaints surfaced last week, there was no need to make a decision
on whether to pull it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never intended to offend anyone, and we apologize if anyone
took it that way,'' said Jane Post, director of the BankBoston
department that oversees advertising. ``That's true of everything
we do.''
</P>
<P>
   The ad in question was part of a campaign that featured the
theme ``This is your time. Spend it wisely.'' As a voiceover noted
how BankBoston offers time-saving solutions that empower consumers
to take control of their finances, the video offered up vignettes
of city dwellers coping with urban life.
</P>
<P>
   One ad's imagery is open to different interpretations.
</P>
<P>
   According to BankBoston, the ad showed a pregnant woman on her
way to work, dodging other pedestrians and car traffic. In a brief
scene, she jumped back to avoid a bicycle messenger, who says
something to her. Viewers didn't hear what the cyclist said.
</P>
<P>
   In the opinion of Jim Merrick, a 46-year-old librarian who
regularly commutes by bike, the ad portrays bicycle riders as
ruffians on wheels.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was rather appalled,'' he said. ``It was offensive.''
</P>
<P>
   Merrick didn't get mad or even. Instead, he got on the Internet
to seek out like-minded souls. In one e-mail, he described the ad
as ``Snarling cyclist nearly wipes out pregnant-woman pedestrian.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon e-mails were proliferating, and some said cyclists should
think about closing their BankBoston accounts in protest.
</P>
<P>
   One of those contacted was Luc Levensohn, an information
technology manager who commutes by bike several times a week
between his Boston office and his home north of the city.
</P>
<P>
   According to Levensohn, Boston is a most inhospitable city for
bicyling, and the BankBoston ad reinforces local attitudes that
cyclists should be held in low regard.
</P>
<P>
   Levensohn estimated that nearly 100 cyclists were recruited to
contact BankBoston and ask that the ad be pulled.
</P>
<P>
   BankBoston said it received seven complaints about the ad. For
the bank, a key question was whether these complaints represented a
spontaneous outpouring of dissatisfaction with the ad or the work
of a few well-wired individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Of the seven people who complained, BankBoston concluded that
only one had actually seen the ad and the rest were responding to
on-line ``networking,'' Post suggested.
</P>
<P>
   Hill Holliday spokesman Eric Fehrnstrom offered the agency's
view of the ad.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not the intention of the ad to show bicyclists in a
negative light,'' he said, adding, ``We could just as easily shown
a taxi or motorcycle roaring past, but then I suppose we would have
risked offending cab drivers and motorcyclists.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether the ad was insensitive or whether cyclists were being
too touchy is open to debate. But one thing is clear: The Internet
makes it easier for individual consumers upset by ads to
orchestrate protests and make advertisers uneasy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be interesting to see how this unfolds,'' said
Post of BankBoston. ``You may see more and more of this.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tom and Ray Magliozzi, a.k.a. Click and Clack, have hosted ``Car
Talk'' on National Public Radio for more than 20 years. Now they
have their first ad campaign. Print ads are about to break, and TV
ads are in the works from Mullen, a Wenham, Mass. ad agency.
</P>
<P>
   NPR stations ``asked us'' for an ad campaign that would talk up
Tom and Ray, said Doug Berman, ``Car Talk'' producer.
</P>
<P>
   Many folks are a bit intimidated by NPR's highbrow repuation.
But if they can be persuaded to try ``Car Talk,'' they might change
their minds _ and stick around for other NPR shows.
</P>
<P>
   Created by the Mullen tag team of Stephen Mietelski and Michael
Ancevic, the first print ads feature the theme ``A Survivalist's
Guide for Listening to Car Talk.'' Ads suggest ``Car Talk'' is such
a showcase of hilarity that listeners who don't take proper
precautions might be hurt by the convulsions of laughter that Tom
and Ray induce.

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; TIRANA, Albania -- Three weeks ago, Vigan Budima was just
another young refugee, one of the thousands of anonymous faces seen
fleeing desperately from Kosovo. But in the days since, he has
become something else: the top Web page designer at Albania Online,
the biggest Internet company in the capital, his temporary
hometown. Budima, 18, arrived here with his parents after a
four-day journey through Montenegro with only packets of food and
the clothes on his back. He had no idea what had become of his
brother, Valon.
</P>
<P>
   So, as thousands of refugees waited in long lines for a
telephone, Budima knocked on the door of an Internet provider he
saw listed in the newspaper and asked if he could send his brother
an e-mail. Within hours, he had persuaded the owners of Albania
Online to hire him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good for me. I don't have anything else to do,'' Budima
said, fiddling with a computer mouse and demonstrating his latest
designs from what has become his private office. ``Also, this is a
poor country. This Internet is new for them. There's not much
home-page development here.'' His good fortune is one extraordinary
story in a country where hundreds of thousands of Kosovars spend
their days in cramped refugee camps, and hundreds have no shelter
at all. But his ambition is strikingly common among his peers, many
of whom have sought jobs or volunteer work since arriving in
Albania in an effort to hold on to a fragment of normal life.
</P>
<P>
   In hotels and restaurants in Tirana, as well as in humanitarian
organizations in northern Albania, Kosovars are seeping into the
fabric of the country, with engineers working as English
translators and teachers working as office assistants. Some have
even managed to get jobs in their own field, like the doctors now
working with humanitarian health teams.
</P>
<P>
   Their motive clearly is not economic; few Albanian companies can
afford to pay refugees for work, and any wages are far below what
professionals earned in Kosovo. Instead, many refugees seemed to be
emerging from a state of shock into one of boredom, leaving them
anxious to re-create pieces of their former lives.
</P>
<P>
   They are frustrated by the length of time that has passed since
they left Kosovo. Although they hope to return home in a matter of
weeks, many say they are looking for things to do in the meantime
-- particularly if it means helping other refugees. ``You've got to
remember: These aren't peasants. Kosovo is not in the Stone Age,''
said Rick Grant, an official of CARE International. ``These are
educated, cultivated people, and it's natural for people who are
successful in their homelands to want to show some initiative, even
in this kind of situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Grant said, ``Nothing is worse than to sit in a refugee
camp, day after day after day. It's like being in a penitentiary.
There's absolutely nothing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Valdet Nila can attest to that. After traveling into Albania
from his hometown of Pec, Nila, 35, said he spent a week in a
Tirana refugee camp, wandering all day between rows of tents. When
the owner of a nearby hotel offered to shelter Nila and his family
for a few days, he accepted, but only after insisting on
volunteering as a translator at the hotel's front desk. He soon
realized he was the only employee who could speak English.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told the owner, no pay is fine,'' said Nila, who ran a
family paint business in Kosovo and who now stays with his wife,
parents, and three children in room 42 of the Hotel Balkani. ``In
the camp, all the time I was saying, `I need work to spend my time.
I don't want to just walk around and smoke cigarettes.' `` Urban
Kosovars appear to be the most restless -- and the most useful to
Albanian and foreign companies -- because many worked at office
jobs in cities such as Pristina and Prizren and learned to speak
more than one European language. In that sense, they are more
employable than many Albanian natives, whose formal education
sometimes stops at the eighth grade. The sudden emergence of
refugees in the work force is a welcome sign to humanitarian
officials, who say it creates a kind of welfare-to-work atmosphere
in a system otherwise built on communist-era dependence.
</P>
<P>
   Kosovar Albanians ``obviously know the language, know the
culture, know the needs,'' said Rick Brennan, director of health
for the International Rescue Committee, a New York-based medical
team that has hired refugees in Macedonia and Albania. ``It allows
them to maintain their skills and their dignity.''
</P>
<P>
   At Albania Online, the symbols of Budima's gratitude are
emblazoned on his computer screen. He has created five home pages
in the past two weeks -- including ones for the Albanian Democratic
Party and for the country's largest radio station. He learned his
skills after school on an outdated computer in his parents' home.
But he was a pro even in high school: When his brother Valon, 27,
opened an Internet-provider firm in Pristina, Budima became a
long-distance employee, designing sites and communicating by modem
from Pec.
</P>
<P>
   His brother's company, Pro.net, shut down last month after the
NATO airstrikes began. Valon left a few days later. Budima and his
parents, both teachers, left their apartment March 28.
</P>
<P>
   After driving first to Montenegro, they decided to go on to
Albania, in the hopes that distant relatives might take them in.
When Budima got here, he thought that he might be able to reach
Valon by e-mail. ``I came here and asked if I can use the computer
for just half an hour,'' he said from the office of Albania Online.
``Then I showed them some home pages I'd done. They were
impressed.''
</P>
<P>
   He worked out a deal: $30 per home page and access to the
Internet. But several days later, he got an even greater reward.
</P>
<P>
   An e-mail came back from Valon. He said he had fled south from
Pristina toward Macedonia, spending six horrific days trapped near
the border before being allowed to enter a refugee camp. After
making it to safety, Valon had the same inspiration as his younger
brother.
</P>
<P>
   He sought out an Internet cafe. And there, from hundreds of
miles away, he let his family know he had survived.

<P>
   NEW HAVEN, Conn. _ Connecticut has a contradictory public image,
seen as a bland suburb of New York yet regarded as a backwater of
traditional Yankee stodginess.
</P>
<P>
   There is truth in both views, but neither is even close to the
whole story. The part of Fairfield County known as the Gold Coast
is truly oriented toward New York. From stately Westport (home of
Paul Newman) to trendy New Canaan (home of David Letterman) to
wealthy Greenwich, most everybody works, or at least shops, in
Manhattan. It's even considered part of the New York television
market.
</P>
<P>
   This area is also a convenient gateway to New York for visitors.
Guests can stay at the Sheraton or Marriott hotels in Stamford for
a third of the price of a comparable room in midtown Manhattan,
take a 45-minute train ride to Grand Central Terminal for $10 and
enjoy a day in the big town without risking their cars in the
maddening traffic.
</P>
<P>
   But the true flavor of Connecticut does not start to come
through until you move away from the New York area.
</P>
<P>
   Heading east along the shoreline, about 45 minutes from Stamford
on Interstate 95, is New Haven, home of stately Yale University and
its many museums, including the Yale University Art Gallery, the
Yale Center for British Art and the Peabody Museum of Natural
History. The leafy area around Yale has a college-town atmosphere,
with trendy shops and ethnic restaurants. New Haven is also
renowned for its thin-crust pizza; try Frank Pepe's Pizzeria
Napoletana on Wooster Street.
</P>
<P>
   The Yale Repertory Theater produces performances by Yale drama
students, professional actors and guest troupes. The Schubert
Performing Arts Center and the Long Wharf Theater are both known
for staging Broadway-bound shows.
</P>
<P>
   To the east of New Haven, out in the woods near the Rhode Island
border, are two of the newest, largest casinos in the world:
Foxwoods Resort Casino and the Mohegan Sun. They have all the
polish of the big Vegas casinos with none of the glitz, creating a
more subdued and somewhat more elegant atmosphere, even in the
grim-faced, chain-smoking slot-machine sections.
</P>
<P>
   Foxwoods, owned by the Mashantucket Pequot tribe, rises out of
the woods of the reservation near Ledyard like a medieval city. It
is the largest, most profitable casino on the planet. Ten miles
away, the Mohegan Sun casino, nationally recognized for the
striking blend of traditional and modern elements in its
architecture, is an up-and-coming competitor.
</P>
<P>
   The tribal rivalry is in at least its fourth century. When the
Pequots opened a critically acclaimed museum near their casino, the
Mohegans protested the museum's account of a massacre of the
Pequots in 1637 by English colonists. The Mohegans' ancestors are
portrayed as collaborators with the English.
</P>
<P>
   Just south of the casinos is Mystic Seaport, the nation's
largest maritime museum (think Sturbridge Village by the sea) with
a working shipyard producing replicas of vintage sailing vessels.
The nearby Mystic Marinelife Aquarium has whales, dolphins, seals
and all manner of other ocean creatures.
</P>
<P>
   Two nearby restaurants are worth keeping in mind, if you feel
like a splurge: Randall's Ordinary in North Stonington serves
18th-century hearth-cooked meals in rustic fire-lit dining rooms
(there is a pleasant small inn on the premises), and Abbott's
Lobster in the Rough in Noank (open during the summer only) has
spectacular seafood in a casual ocean-view setting.
</P>
<P>
   About an hour inland, in the center of the state, is Hartford,
the capital city. It is so closely identified with the insurance
industry, its dominant business, that an annoyed Boston Globe
columnist last year called it ``America's file cabinet.'' The
columnist was annoyed because Hartford, as part of a nascent urban
renaissance, was trying to lure away the New England Patriots with
promises of a new riverfront stadium.
</P>
<P>
   But Hartford has some remarkable gems.
</P>
<P>
   The Wadsworth Atheneum, the first public art museum in the
United States, has a large collection of European and American art
and houses the Amistad Foundation African-American Collection. The
Mark Twain House, where the author wrote ``Tom Sawyer,''
``Huckleberry Finn'' and other novels, stands next to the Harriet
Beecher Stowe House, home of the abolitionist author of ``Uncle
Tom's Cabin.''
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Park, on the West Hartford border, has extensive rose
gardens that peak late in June. Expect to see brides there on sunny
Saturdays, being photographed among the flowering shrubs and
arbors. There are many noteworthy museums within 20 minutes of
downtown Hartford, including the Hill-Stead Museum in Farmington,
which features a fine collection of French impressionist paintings;
the New Britain Museum of American Art, with a collection of more
than 4,000 American artworks and a growing reputation for
innovative exhibits; and Dinosaur State Park, where an enclosure
protects a slew of 200-million-year-old dinosaur footprints.
</P>
<P>
   From Hartford, it's another hour's drive to the Litchfield Hills
in the northwestern part of the state, a favorite destination of
well-to-do New Yorkers in search of a respite. In some towns the
summer population nearly equals the year-round population. This is
where Connecticut looks most like a part of New England, with
church spires poking above the trees of traditional town greens
that once served as communal pastures. Antiques shopping is among
the more vigorous pursuits for visitors.
</P>
<P>
   The Litchfield Hills attractions are more aesthetic than active,
more about seeing than doing. Gardeners may want to make a
pilgrimage to White Flower Farm in the town of Litchfield, one of
the pre-eminent plant nurseries in the country with 10 acres of
display gardens. The Glebe House Museum in Woodbury, site of the
only garden in the United States planned by the British garden
designer Gertrude Jekyll, is also worth a visit.
</P>
<P>
   In autumn the roads in the Litchfield Hills are full of
leaf-peepers, in search of that quintessential photo of flaming
trees and New England countryside. One place with a good chance of
providing it is the picturesque village of West Cornwall, where a
135-year-old covered wooden bridge spans the Housatonic River.
</P>
<P>
   The view of Connecticut from that bridge is tranquil, timeless
and very Yankee. Maybe it's a stereotype, or else just part of a
much bigger picture.

BANKS BETTER AT COMMUNITY LENDING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Birds gotta fly. Advocates gotta advocate.
</P>
<P>
   That explains why advocates for a long list of community groups
crowded into an auditorium at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston
this week to complain about the pending merger between Fleet
Financial Group and BankBoston.
</P>
<P>
   The activists, including the Rev. Al Sharpton, argued that the
$14.6 billion the two banks plan to set aside for small business
and low-income lending is inadequate. Because this is the perfect
time to exert pressure, at least some of the activists laid it on
pretty thick.
</P>
<P>
   They staged demonstrations. They shouted ``shame on you'' when
bank executives explained the benefits of the deal. They warned of
hard times ahead for minorities in the city unless the banks agreed
to do more.
</P>
<P>
   You can't blame the advocates. Their job is to make things sound
as bad as possible so they can get the maximum amount of dollars
for their cause. But in the interest of the truth, it's worth
bringing a little perspective to the discussion.
</P>
<P>
   Simply put, things have gotten an awful lot better in Boston
when it comes to banks and the money they make available to the
city's low-income and minority residents.
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago banks were as rare as roof decks in the city's poor
neighborhoods. But beginning in 1989, prodded by the government,
community activists, and a landmark Federal Reserve study on
mortgage lending to minorities, the banks changed their ways.
</P>
<P>
   They put up branches in low-income neighborhoods. They installed
dozens of automated teller machines in those same neighborhoods.
And perhaps most importantly, they turned on the lending spigot.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, banks and other lenders made 287 mortgage loans to
blacks in Boston. By 1996 that number was up to 900. Over the same
time mortgages to Hispanics climbed from 96 to nearly 400,
according to statistics gathered by Jim Campen, an associate
profesor of economics at the University of Massachusetts at Boston.
</P>
<P>
   With a slight lag, the same thing started to happen all around
the country. In a recent report, the Joint Center for Housing
Studies at Harvard University pointed out that minorities now
account for more than 30 percent of all first-time home buyers, up
from less than 20 percent in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, banks made a remarkable discovery: You could do
business in central cities and make a profit. Citizens Bank, which
has 25 percent of its Massachusetts branches in areas the US Census
Bureau calls low- and moderate-income tracts, has done well in
those branches, even selling mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``My customers there aren't being bombarded by Chase and
Fidelity every night,'' Citizens vice chairman Robert Mahoney once
explained.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, competition for urban business has heated up. Citizens
says applications for the small business loans it sees these days
typically are shopped to several other banks. There is also
increased competition for mortgage business.
</P>
<P>
   Consider: Between 1995 and 1997, Fleet's mortgage loans to local
minorities dropped sharply, according to Campen's tally. The bank
doesn't dispute the finding, but says the drop-off was the result
of problems in its mortgage unit, not any deliberate pullback from
low-income neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Yet over that same two-year period, loans to blacks and
Hispanics in the city stayed roughly flat. In other words, the void
left by Fleet was filled by other competitors.
</P>
<P>
   The message here is not that all the problems of the central
city have been solved. Far from it. Robert Fichter, an executive
with the Massachusetts Bankers Association, points out a relatively
new one: affordability.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a modest home in a city neighborhood now costs $200,000,
that's a problem,'' says Fichter. Call it one of the perils of
prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   The Boston Globe this week reported on growing fears of
gentrification in Roxbury. Professionals, both white and black, are
buying up houses in the neighborhood, paying prices that sound more
appropriate for Lexington than Roxbury.
</P>
<P>
   Under those circumstances, even banks willing to make mortgage
loans are not going to be able to put low- and middle-income people
into houses. The numbers just won't work.
</P>
<P>
   The advocates may yet have their way. The banks could
conceivably decide to boost their community lending. In today's
booming economy they could probably afford it without much
sacrifice to the bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   But whatever happens, don't believe it when someone tells you
that we're not going back to the bad old days. The world has
changed too much for that to happen.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   The Red Herring
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   John Hancock Funds, the mutual fund arm of the big insurance
company, Thursday said chief executive Edward J. Boudreau Jr. will
retire at the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Maureen Ford, president of Hancock's broker/dealer distribution
network, will replace him.
</P>
<P>
   Boudreau, 54, has been with Hancock for 32 years, the last 11 as
head of the mutual fund complex. Over that time the firm's assets
under management grew from $3 billion to $34 billion.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, however, Hancock's funds have had their
problems. ``They have a good brand name but they have been under
pressure,'' said Chris J. Brown, an analyst with Financial Research
Corp.
</P>
<P>
   After years of great performance, Hancock's best-known fund, its
Regional Bank fund, has struggled over the past year, which has
prompted investors to pull their money out, said Brown. As a
medium-sized player in the fund business, Hancock has also had
difficulty building the critical mass it needs for success, Brown
said.

VENTURA GRAPPLES WITH PEROT TO LEAD REFORM PARTY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ This does not seem like a fair fight: Jesse ``The
Body'' Ventura against Ross ``I'm all ears'' Perot. But in the
lively political contest for leadership of the Reform Party that
Perot founded and to which Ventura gave fame, it is hard to tell
which one is the professional wrestler.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota Governor Ventura, the first candidate elected
statewide on the Reform Party ticket, appears to have won round
one. Perot's handpicked party chairman, Russell Verney, announced
on Wednesday that he would not seek reelection at the party's
national convention July 23 through 25 in Dearborn, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe now is the right time for me to step aside and let
new leadership blossom, and to let those who have been working hard
move up and take over,'' Verney said Thursday in his office at
Perot's headquarters in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Verney insists his decision to resign was made long before June
28, when Ventura sent hundreds of convention delegates an e-mail
endorsing another candidate for chairman _ Jack Gargan of Cedar
Key, Fla. _ and threatening to pack up his star power and stay away
from the national Reform Party if Gargan was not elected.
</P>
<P>
   Nor was Verney persuaded to leave, he said, by Ventura's latest
power play: His very public recruiting of Lowell Weicker, a former
Connecticut governor and senator, to be a Reform Party presidential
candidate in 2000. Weicker, who did not support Perot in his 1992
and 1996 campaigns for the White House, said he ``has no idea'' if
the Texas billionaire would run again, but hoped he would not. ``A
third time and people will just make fun of the Reform Party,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura has been more blunt. In interviews and in his new book,
``I Ain't Got Time to Bleed,'' Ventura has said that for the Reform
Party to survive, the time has come for Perot to go and the guard
to change.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing personal against Perot _ I think he's commendable,''
Ventura wrote in his autobiography, adding that he voted for the
maverick independent twice. ``But for whatever reason, he wants to
remain out front. He's fallen a great distance from the first time
he ran, and he fell again the second time. He had better step aside
in this next election, or the party won't exist anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Steven Schier, chairman of the political science department at
Carleton College and a commentator on Minnesota politics, said
Ventura is using his position as the reigning king of Reform Party
candidates to lead the first serious attempt to wrest control of
the party from Perot and push him out of the picture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perot is entrenched and stubborn, so Jesse, who is about as
subtle as a Mack truck, is hitting the mule over the head with a
board,'' Schier said. ``But this could turn into a free-for-all at
the convention. These are uncharted waters, and it is hard to
believe Perot will go quietly.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, Perot has been very quiet about the whole matter. He did
not answer requests for an interview, and Verney said his boss is
keeping a low profile because ``the future of the Reform Party
depends on tens of thousands of great, hard-working activists, not
on one person's celebrity.''
</P>
<P>
   Perot, who received almost 20 percent of the presidential vote
in 1992 and 8.5 percent in 1996, has not disclosed his intentions
for 2000. Ventura says he will serve out his four-year term in
Minnesota and not run for president next year. Because of Perot's
vote in 1996, the Reform Party's presidential candidate next year
will be eligible for $12.6 million in federal matching funds.
</P>
<P>
   But Perot will be at the national convention, giving the keynote
speech on July 24 and energizing his followers before they vote the
next day on the slate of party officers. Ventura has been offered a
speaking slot on July 23, before many of the delegates arrive.
</P>
<P>
   Gargan, who sought Ventura's endorsement for chairman, says the
schedule of speeches is just one example of how the party
leadership has manipulated rules and procedures to quash anti-Perot
dissent and minimize the governor's role in the national party.
Gargan also is rankled that Perot did not help finance Ventura's
campaign last year, though Verney said the large loan Ventura
sought from Perot would have been illegal under campaign-finance
rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jesse Ventura is the greatest public relations piece the
Reform Party has _ he talks the party talk and walks the walk,''
said Gargan, a Reform Party veteran who has run unsuccessfully for
governor and the US House in Florida. ``But instead of playing him
up to the hilt, our national committee pretends he is not one of
us. What is wrong with this picture?''
</P>
<P>
   Verney says Perot feels ``no rivalry'' with Ventura. ``Ross has
stepped back and taken the focus off himself and let Jesse run with
no interference,'' said Verney, who was born in Brighton and at one
time was executive director of the New Hampshire Democratic Party.
``Ventura tells Perot to `get out of the way.' Well, who has stood
in Jesse's way, who has impeded him in the least?''
</P>
<P>
   But analysts say the Reform Party, which was born as a vanity
plate for Perot and then grew on good-government issues such as
campaign finance reform and term limits, is at a crossroads. Will
it become a functional third party, fielding candidates at all
levels of government, or will it remain a vessel for the
presidential ambitions of outsiders like Ventura and Perot?
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is, will the Reform Party become a real third
party with some potential, or does it continue to be Ross Perot's
toy,'' said Sandy Maisel, a government professor at Colby College.
``The significance of Ventura's victory is that it gives the party
an opportunity to become something other than one person's vehicle
for salving an ego.''

GUTTERS ARE NOT ALWAYS NECESSARY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, July 11, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. I bought a 100-year-old house with a fieldstone foundation
and no gutters. It would be hard to install gutters, but the ground
is eroding away from the house where water constantly cascades. The
roof overhang is about 12 inches. Do I really have to put in
gutters? I have plenty of space to regrade, even allowing the
ground to slope down from the house, but how can I keep the ground
from eroding further? There is a sump and a sump pump in the
basement, but I have gotten no leaks so far.
</P>
<P>
   MARK GENDREAU, Andover, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. The handyman is not popular with gutter people when he says
gutters are not always necessary, but I think in some cases gutters
are, indeed, not needed. Yours is one of them. Your roof overhang
is more than adequate to allow cascading water to clear the house
wall. Regrading will allow that water to run down, away from the
house. To prevent further erosion, build a concrete apron about 6
inches deep and 18 inches wide, on the earth along each side of the
house, right up against the foundation. Slope it very slightly.
This will help prevent splashing water from bouncing back to the
house and also slow down the flow away from the house.
</P>
<P>
   The handyman's colonial house has a six-inch overhang on all
four sides of the house, and a concrete apron. It has worked well
for more than 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have to replace my outdoor wood steps. Would you recommend
cedar as opposed to pressure-treated wood? I understand
pressure-treated wood cracks.
</P>
<P>
   ED LETIC, Leominster, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Cedar is acceptable for steps; it resists decay. I suggest
that you use pressure-treated for the stringers and cedar for the
treads; there is no need for risers (the board that sets just below
the treads). Space the tread boards to allow drainage. You could
leave the cedar as is, apply a sealer, or treat it with a
semitransparent stain. If the treads drain properly, and do not
stay wet but dry out between wettings, the treads will last
inedefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   Pressure-treated wood may crack. It may spall, it may splinter,
and it may do other things that wood does outdoors. That is because
it dries out after installation and shrinks. And it may not.
Treating it with a wood preservative or sealer may help prevent
this.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. What kind of a waterproofing paint can I use on a window in
the bathroom. It is right in the bath/shower area, so it gets a lot
of water.
</P>
<P>
   ANNE MARTIN, Dorchester, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. I'll bet that windows were installed over the bathtub in old
houses long before Americans got into the daily shower habit.
</P>
<P>
   Interior paints are water resistant; some may stand up to wear
and tear and water better than others. Try this to paint the
window. Zinsser makes an acrylic interior paint called Perma-White,
which not only resists moisture if applied properly but also is
mildew-resistant. If there is mildew present, treat the wood with
one part household bleach and three parts water, to kill the
mildew. Rinse. Wear skin and eye protection when working with
bleach. Apply a latex enamel undercoater and one coat, possibly
two, of the Perma-White, which can be tinted.
</P>
<P>
   To get around this, cover the window with a shower-type curtain.
This is what Arlys Sakata of Wichita, Kan., suggested. Be sure to
open the curtain when done showering so you don't trap moisture
between it and the window.
</P>
<P>
   Helen Walden of Harwich said she uses plastic blinds with narrow
slats. Install them on the full casing, close the slats when
showering, open them to dry out, then raise the blind out of the
way.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am having my bathroom redone. The clawfoot tub is
unsightly. What can I do about it? I also plan to put big ceramic
tile (12 inches square) on the floor. The contractor said such big
tiles break easily when installed. How can I keep them from
breaking?
</P>
<P>
   MARY LOU COVENEY, Jamaica Plain, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. If you can find a buyer, you can make a bundle on a clawfoot
tub. New ones in catalogs sell for $700 and up, way up, beyond
$1,000. You can try advertising in the Want Advertiser.
</P>
<P>
   But you might be able to spruce it up. If the inside is dirty,
try this: Wet it with hydrogen peroxide, apply cream of tartar, and
leave for an hour or so. Scrub and rinse. If the tub is still bad,
you could have it resurfaced. Then paint the outside a contrasting
color, and still another color for the clawfeet.
</P>
<P>
   And, you can buy a surround-type shower rod, one that lets the
curtain cover all four sides of the tub. Home Goods and other
specialty shops sell such rods and curtains.
</P>
<P>
   As for the big tiles, they won't break if installed on an even
surface with thin-set mortar. Breakage usually occurs when the
surface is uneven or rises a little; the tile then rocks when
stepped on and breaks.
</P>
<P>
   To get around this, on an uneven surfaces, use small tiles; six
inches square will do. Small tiles will look better in a small
bathroom.
</P>

<P>
   Approaching a 100th birthday, a human of the species barely gets
around, dwells on Thursdays instead of an extremely finite number
of tomorrows, and is petrified of taking a nasty fall.
</P>
<P>
   But as the US economy roars into its 100th consecutive month of
continued expansion, the old girl is exceedingly spry, jacked up on
a steady diet of low interest rates. Even the one-notch
quarter-percent belt-tightening telegraphed in advance and eased
down with some of old Doc Greenspan's castor oil had the opposite
effect he intended. That goosed the Dow Jones average to a new
high, instead of taking some of the hot air out of the economic
balloon.
</P>
<P>
   The bears, the contrarians, the short-sellers, the
gloom-and-doomers, the dusty academics who periodically break forth
with ``you'll be sorr-eeeeee'' if you don't hunker down in advance
of the coming crash, have omelette all over their long faces.
</P>
<P>
   Because this here epidemic of economic optimism eclipses the
JFK-LBJ war-fueled expansion of the '60s. There's never been an
economic expansion as long and as lusty as this one.
</P>
<P>
   Even our new treasury secretary, Lawrence Summers, quaffed some
of the feel-good moonshine in his very first week on the job: ``If
we can keep our fundamentals strong and continue the terrific
productivity improvement, I think we have got room to give people
wage increases that run ahead of price increases and represent
really higher standards of living,'' Summers told NBC.
</P>
<P>
   One hundred months and climbing. We keep spending to beat the
bend, both as consumers, and as public officials. Twenty-five years
ago, Americans saved almost 10 percent of the weekly paycheck. In
May, the savings level was minus 1.2 percent. And that spending
spree is what is boosting retail sales, home construction, and new
vehicles flying off dealer lots.
</P>
<P>
   The temporary dent in government spending that was arrived at
only after vast verbiage and much deal-making makes the deficit
picture uncharacteristically rosier than it has been since the
'50s.
</P>
<P>
   It is conceivable, President Clinton said with reasonable
grounds for contending such, that in 15 years, every debt owed by
Uncle Sam to anyone anywhere will be paid off.
</P>
<P>
   The red ink total is currently $5.6 trillion. But with the
economy going gangbusters, and tax revenue falling from the sky
into the treasury's coffers, the debt can be halved within five
years, and even more money saved by not having to pay interest to
government bond-holders. Of course, that scenario will be blown to
smithereens by a sharp recession, a war, the precipitate collapse
of some important financial institution, or an asteroid hitting
Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   Such a deliriously ambitious goal _ paying off all the debt
accumulated over two and a half centuries _ would also probably
require the repeal of a substantial portion of human nature. I
refer to that part of the politician's DNA which propels the
politician to say ``yes'' when ``no'' is the right answer.
</P>
<P>
   You get elected by saying ``yes;'' you also go into debt when
saying ``yes.'' And the Klown Kollege that is our Krazy Kongress
kannot say ``no'' when the simple negative is what is required. The
rosy projections made possible by the zooming economy presume and
imply that fiscal discipline will be exerted.
</P>
<P>
   That means the Democrats can't go bananas devising new social
spending schemes, and the Republicans can't get their jollies
handing out tax cuts to fat cats. Don't bet on either side not
taking the easy way out. President Clinton this week bravely toured
some of the nation's poverty spots, trying to persuade the rich to
remember the poor.
</P>
<P>
   With his uncanny knack for not seeming to promise any more than
he might possibly deliver, Clinton stressed private-sector
solutions and government tax breaks for targeted investments in
run-down areas. But with their penchant for crashing through the
guardrail every time their bus rounds a curve near a precipice, the
Republicans sprang their tax-cut-for-them-that's-already-made-it.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know where the Republicans take their polls. It must be
at the country club bar, the board room picnic, or wherever
plutocrats prevail. Because passing a tax cut at the moment is the
most pressing government need to only one American in 11, according
to The Wall Street Journal/NBC poll, while one in four say it is
building up public schools, one in five say it is fixing Social
Security, and one in six say it is improving morality.
</P>
<P>
   But slice a Republican, and out bleeds a tax cut. It's in the
bloodstream, apparently. So the solons of the majority party,
joined by the more opportunistic of their Democratic benchmates,
trot out the old 
let's-make-it-easier-on-the-rich-but-pretend-we're-doing-it-for-the-
middle-class schemes. If there's one thing the hotter-than-hot
stock market does not need at this point, it's a chunk out of the
capital-gains tax, which is now down to 20 percent and would go to
15 under the GOP plan.
</P>
<P>
   So Democrats want to spend on new social programs which they
deem worthy uses of public dough, and Republicans want to spend the
surplus on tax cuts for the folks who vote for the GOP. Inside
every dieted-down congressman is a big fat spender aching to get
loose. The next election, presidency and the House, will go to the
party that most assures voters in the middle that it will look out
for their economic interests. They'll promise you all sorts of
cholesterol-drenched porky plans. You can't count on the pols to
say ``no'' for you; you've got to say ``no'' for yourself.

POLICE HOPE DNA WILL TELL IF DESALVO REALLY WAS STRANGLER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MCGRORY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- More than 35 years after a serial killer held this
city in his sinister grip, police have embarked on a secretive
effort to answer one of the most enduring questions in the annals
of national crime: Was Albert DeSalvo really the Boston Strangler?
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses have died and memories have faded. No matter. Police
acknowledged this week that they are hoping to push the limits of
DNA science to link DeSalvo to the killings or, as many expect,
exonerate him.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation was launched a couple of years ago by a
tenacious Boston police captain named Timothy Murray and aided by a
new police laboratory that includes some of the most advanced
crime-solving equipment known. Police say they are willing to
exhume DeSalvo's body if they find DNA samples they need to match.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Strangler case is one of the most notorious in the
country,'' Murray said Thursday. ``If we can solve this, it might
spark other cities to use DNA to solve old crimes. There's no
statute of limitations on murder.''
</P>
<P>
   From the summer of 1962 to the early winter of 1964, the city
and its suburbs were terrified of a serial killer known variously
as the Phantom Fiend and the Boston Strangler _ a murderer who
often left flamboyant, looping bows around the women he killed.
</P>
<P>
   Gun stores sold out. Local dog pounds saw a run on even their
smallest mutts. Locksmiths were summoned from morning to night and
women set up telephone trees to monitor each others' safety. The
streets were empty after dark.
</P>
<P>
   The terror finally came to an end when DeSalvo, a handsome,
smooth-talking laborer, confessed to 13 killings while he was being
held on a series of rape charges in 1965 at the Center for the
Treatment of Sexually Dangerous Persons at Bridgewater. He was
never charged with the crimes or linked to them by physical
evidence. Rather, he was sentenced to life in prison for an
unrelated series of rapes, and was murdered in Walpole by another
inmate in November 1973.
</P>
<P>
   There were many doubters, including DeSalvo's relatives and
family members of some of the victims. One family even called
Murray recently to voice suspicions that the real murderer was
someone else, someone they named. Police were among the most
skeptical of DeSalvo's claims of guilt, but were prevented from
questioning him by the attorney general's office, which directed
the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   All along, many thought DeSalvo incapable of murder, prone to
braggadocio and in search of fame. Some psychiatrists believed that
the stranglings were not the work of a single killer. Serial
killers, they said, carefully choose victims with the same
characteristics. In Boston, the slain women differed markedly in
age, with the first six in their 50s and 60s, and the later ones in
their 20s and 30s.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of DeSalvo's confession, some investigators said he
knew details of the crimes that only the killer could know. But,
further fueling the doubters, a 1995 book by author Susan Kelly
showed that DeSalvo could have gleaned all his intimate knowledge
of the crime scenes from voluminous newspaper accounts.
Alternately, Kelly wrote, he could have learned about the slayings
through contact with the real killer in Bridgewater. He then
recited the details to investigators and his lawyer, F. Lee Bailey,
with the help of what was believed to be a photographic memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was much debate over whether there was one killer or
multiple killers and whether copy-catting was going on,'' said
Murray. ``People may have been disguising murders.''
</P>
<P>
   As head of the department's Cold Case Squad, Murray has rattled
cemeteries and sliced through history in search of murder suspects,
winning convictions against killers who committed crimes dating
back to the 1960s. Families, he said, never rest easy until a
killer is caught or known.
</P>
<P>
   For the last 18 months, police have faced myriad frustrations in
their efforts to reassemble the massive evidence in the Strangler
investigation. They know that potential DNA samples exist. Case
logs, for example, describe swabbings of sperm samples found on the
mouth and chest of the last victim, as well as on other victims,
but detectives have not been able to locate any of it. They also
believe the blood-covered knife used to kill DeSalvo has probably
been preserved, but haven't been able to find it. Finding the knife
would provide a potentially clean DNA sample and allow them to
avoid exhuming the body.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been searching things out, but we don't have
everything we need at this point,'' said Joseph Varlaro, a civilian
criminalist in the laboratory. He described the assembled evidence
and log books as being like ``reading a book with every other page
missing.''
</P>
<P>
   Using DNA testing, scientists can analyze bodily fluids, tissue,
or bone and develop a genetic fingerprint that narrows a person's
identity to one in many, many millions. The technology, developed
in the 1980s, was made famous in the O.J. Simpson double-murder
trial and has become common practice in courts across the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Varlaro and Don Hayes, the director of the lab, located a semen
stain on an old blanket found near one of the victims. But when
they tested it for DNA, the sample had degraded to the point of
being useless, Varlaro said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are on a quest for semen,'' he said. ``We do have reason to
believe these were crimes of a sexual nature.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigators say they have to develop DNA evidence from at
least two of the killings to prove or disprove that DeSalvo was a
serial killer. If he is exonerated, they acknowledge, it raises the
chilling possibility that one or possibly many more killers got
away with murder in the frenzy of the original investigation.
</P>
<P>
   One pitfall to the current effort: Murray and his partner,
Lieutenant Stephen Murphy, have both been promoted out of what had
been the Cold Case Squad, reassigned so that they are no longer
directing the Strangler case.
</P>
<P>
   As the other investigators regroup, Murray says it's now up to
the department higher-ups to determine the weight they will give
the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``You approach it with an open mind,'' he said. ``You don't come
in with a preconceived notion that DeSalvo was the killer or not
the killer.''

THE BEAT HITS THE ROAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM SULLIVAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   You can call it techno or call it electronica, but you may just
want to call it heaven when the triple-bill ``Community Service''
tour sets up shop at the Palladium in Worcester Saturday night. And
quite a shop it should be. On tap: the pioneering English duo
Orbital, consisting of brothers Paul and Phil Hartnoll, English
electronica/dance/rockers Lo Fidelity All-Stars, and the
California-based instigators Scott Kirkland and Ken Jordan of
Crystal Method. More than this, you'll get a full-blown
bells-and-whistles production _ four large, revolving projection
screens and a state-of-the-art sound system imported by Orbital.
</P>
<P>
   What it should not be is faceless, a charge often accurately
leveled at the electronica genre. The groups may use samplers and
synthesizers _ the tools of the digital age _ but all three main
acts are serious about live performance and the performer-audience
bond, about the seamless (and potentially ecstatic) blending of
dance and rock crowds.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is what we like to do, all stitched together,'' says Paul
Hartnoll, speaking both of the crowd and the bands' sounds. ``If we
combine sources, hopefully, people will turn it on like they do
dance music . . . although I don't think we make dance music.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, they do _ sort of. Orbital's sound is more cerebral, more
free-floating and less rhythmically based, than it was a decade ago
when it formed, but it will make you move. Crystal Method, as
evidenced by their current hit ``Busy Child'' (with its relentless
``I guess I didn't know'' refrain), is a body-shaking band of the
first order. As to the trippy funk-rock 'n ravers Lo Fidelity
All-Stars, we'll turn it over to DJ-singer Phil Ward, a.k.a. The
Albino Priest: ``Someone described us as a rock 'n' roll band that
just happens to make dance music. We're rock 'n' roll in attitude _
we believe in full-on distortion and nosie _ but dance music and
hip-hop is what we grew up listening to. To take the rock 'n' roll
attitude, it doesn't mean you have to stand there with a spread
stance, making a big guitar sound.'' He likens the to-and-fro
nature of the Lo Fi's dance/rock sound to that of Primal Scream and
Stone Roses, just coming from the other direction.
</P>
<P>
   At their shows, Ward says, ``you see kids wearing Limp Bizkit
and Rancid t-shirts, and not seeing any difference in terms of
energy and ideas. With the Chemical Brothers and Prodigy (doing
what they're doing now) there's not a massive divide.''
</P>
<P>
   Ward credits the members of Orbital with being godheads of the
genre. ``We don't really know about Crystal Method,'' he says,
``but to play on the same bill as Orbital, well, growing up in
England and lsitening to dance music, Orbital were musical
geniuses, with (the songs) `Belfast' and `Chime.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The idea for the ``Community Service'' tour, which is about a
third through its three-week, 18-city sortie, was hatched by
booking agent Sam Kirby and Crystal Method. They intend it to be an
annual event with different bands playing out under its rubric _ a
small scale Lollapalooza, if you will.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the obvious musical differences, these groups differ
from the Lollapalooza ilk in their relationship to stardom. ``I
never set out to be a celebrity or a pop star,'' says Hartnoll. ``I
set out to make music and to start a `career,' a word I use in a
funny sense. I just want to make music and make all my money from
making music, so I don't have to do any other work. That's what I
wanted to do and I achieved it. Now, I get to travel around the
world playing really loudly.''
</P>
<P>
   Hartnoll notes he and his brother are adamant about not
plastering their own mugs on their CD covers and even when they're
on magazine covers or newspaper pages, ``they get thrown away, so
people forget.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are fans of free beer and meeting celebrities,'' admits
Ward, of fame's perks. ``But we're music fans. It's got to be about
the music. We went out and bought 300 records since we'' came to
San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   In concert, the Lo-Fi's use traditional rock instruments plus
electronic gear. They are very much a ``live'' band.
</P>
<P>
   This, says Hartnoll, is how Orbital works on stage: ``I do the
arranging and Phil does the mixing. The only thing you have planned
is the order of the songs, so you will discuss that five minutes
before you go on, but there is no plan. We improvise. We have about
48 channels of mixing going on. We take most of what we need from
the studio with us. (What we play) isn't live _ I would not even
pretend that _ but what we do is improvise with the structure. It
can be very hit or miss. You always think you're prepared for the
unexpected, but the unexpected is a part of nature. Your lead line
could drop out and you only have the bass line _ you cannot panic,
which I tend to do, you move on in a different direction. I have to
condition myself to enjoy yourself, to turn to a different tangent
and incorporate that.''
</P>
<P>
   Crystal Method, which brings a somewhat sardonic edge to the
genre, is presently working on a new album and plans to incorporate
a number of new songs into their set. It is a relentlessly busy
band, one of the first electronica groups to push its image as live
entertainers.
</P>
<P>
   The Lo Fi's are still working material from their debut album,
``How to Operate With a Blown Mind,'' which has been out for a long
time in England _ and thus is at risk to become overly familiar for
the band. ``The crowds have been unbelievable and it breathes new
life into old songs,'' says Ward, who took over main vocals when
the group's former singer, the Wrekked Train, jumped the track last
year. (The Lo Fi's have been recording in a home-studio in San
Francisco, expect to release a new single in England in October and
an album in February.)
</P>
<P>
   DJ John Kelley is accompanying the tour and will spin between
sets.

`EDGE OF SEVENTEEN' TAKES TEEN-AGE ROMANCE SERIOUSLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RENEE GRAHAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
EDGE OF SEVENTEEN 
Written by: Todd Stephens 
Directed by: David Moreton 
Starring: Chris Stafford, Tina Holmes, Anderson Gabrych, Stephanie
McVay, Lea DeLaria 
Running time: 100 minutes 
Rating: Unrated 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Edge of Seventeen'' is a film about teen-agers and sex, but
that's where any comparisons between Todd Stephens and David
Moreton's feature debut, and such hormonally charged movies like
``Cruel Intentions'' or the just-in-theaters, ``American Pie''
should end. This is a poignant, touching story of the longing for
first love, viewed through the life of a suburban high school boy,
played winningly by Chris Stafford.
</P>
<P>
   What also makes ``Edge of Seventeen,'' directed by Moreton, and
written by Stephens, different is that Stafford's Eric is attracted
to men. This is fairly new realization for Eric, but the film isn't
a standard coming-out, coming-of-age drama. More than any other
teen movie of recent memory, ``Edge of Seventeen'' captures the
uncertainty, awkwardness, and pains of adolescence, further
complicated when grappling with questions of sexual identity.
</P>
<P>
   As the film begins, it is the summer of 1984. Eric has completed
his junior year of high school and taken a summer job as a food
server at Crystal Shores, an amusement-park restaurant near his
Sandusky, Ohio, home. Joining him is Maggie (Tina Holmes), his
sweet, pretty best friend, who wants to be more than just Eric's
friend. Of course, Eric, an aspiring musician, would rather spend
time noodling his Moog synthesizer than romancing the indefatigable
Maggie.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Eric doesn't really seem attracted to anyone until he
meets Rod (Anderson Gabrych), an Ohio State University student also
working at Crystal Shores. With his blond hair, and ready,
seductive smile, Rod is openly gay, and openly flirts with Eric who
is all atwitter with the attention.
</P>
<P>
   Most films would make Eric and Rod's inevitable connection
dreamy and mutual _ which it is, for a while. But Eric learns a
hard lesson after spending a romantic evening with Rod, who returns
to school and won't even return Eric's phone calls. His second
encounter with a man he meets at a gay club is no more successful,
leading Eric into a painful and disastrous attempt at lovemaking
with poor, poor Maggie. It's such an emotionally shattering scene,
I defy any audience member not to wince while watching it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Edge of Seventeen'' is worthwhile because it dares to show
adolescent sexual discovery as something other than a laugh-riot of
bodily fluids. It presents the matter seriously without becoming
maudlin. The film is also noteworthy for its portrayal of Eric's
parents as compassionate and understanding _ unlike the clueless
adult dunderheads who usually populate teen movies. Especially
noteworthy is the addictively watchable Lea DeLaria as Eric's
godmother and lesbian ``auntie,'' who takes him under her wing.
</P>
<P>
   Stephens and Moreton only falter with the film's conclusion
which ties the story up too neatly. But that's a small quibble,
with a film that mostly nails just about everything else. And
something must also be said about the film's memory-tugging
soundtrack. From Toni Basil's pounding ``Mickey'' to Eurythmics'
soulful ``Right by Your Side'' to Bronski Beat's anthemic ``Why'' _
Jimmy Somerville's falsetto wail is still a mad, startling thing _
the songs are the perfect seasoning for this memorable first film.

THE SURPRISING TWISTS OF `ARLINGTON ROAD' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
ARLINGTON ROAD 
Directed by: Mark Pellington 
Screenplay by: Ehren Kruger 
Starring: Jeff Bridges, Tim Robbins, Joan Cusack, Hope Davis 
Running time: 117 minutes 
Rated: R (violence and some language) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   How's your paranoia? Now that the Oklahoma City and World Trade
Center bombings have become part of our collective nightmarevision,
conspiracy thrillers like ``Arlington Road'' don't seem quite so
preposterous as they once did. Although you never lose sight of the
manipulations it performs on you, it's a more intelligent and
realistic thriller than most, sober in tone yet laced with
insidiousness and hysteria. Although its build is erratic, it'll
grab and hold you with its take on a married couple in a suburb of
Washington, D.C., the Langs. They have heartland roots written all
over them, but they just may be the terrorists next door, playing
their own deadly version of ``Honey, I Blew Up the FBI.''
</P>
<P>
   The acting is boldly contoured and Ehren Kruger's script aims
the dialogue away from the usual comic strip balloons and toward
the everyday. Yet it tilts the film into the increasing dislocation
of the guy finding himself increasingly isolated in a stonewalling
climate of denial. One big reason the film works as well as it does
is its casting against type of Tim Robbins and Joan Cusack as the
couple in question. Robbins, especially, is synonymous with
liberalism and its causes, except when he's consciously playing
against type, as he did in his own satiric ``Bob Roberts.''
</P>
<P>
   Robbins will creep you out with the calculating look in his eye
as he lobs chitchat at Jeff Bridges' single dad, a history prof
named Michael Faraday, alongside the Little League batting cage
that brings their respective young sons together. His line of chat,
ranging from the innocuous to the insinuating, is just skewed
enough to induce you to share the prof's gnawing suspicion that his
neighbor just might be the next big-time mad bomber? As for Cusack,
nobody more consistently or more superbly embodies scattered charm.
She's spent more than a decade amusing us while seeming to be
waiting around for somebody to reinvent screwball comedy.
</P>
<P>
   Yet their all-American veneer skews disquietingly when they test
Faraday with pointed remarks about nobody in government assuming
responsibility. Have they targeted him for some devious recruitment
scheme, knowing that he's been a mess, and a resentful mess at
that, ever since his FBI agent wife was killed during a botched
raid constructed to echo the Ruby Ridge siege? Are they sinister?
Or is Bridges's character, icon of maladroit decency that he is,
overreacting? The prof's loose-cannon behavior means that nobody
takes him seriously. When he goes to his late wife's FBI partner
and asks him to run a background check on the Langs, the agent
flat-out refuses.
</P>
<P>
   When he then starts playing amateur detective, the Langs grow
chilly, then chilling. Even the new woman in the prof's life (a
satisfyingly edgy Hope Davis) gets nervous and wonders if the prof
isn't going off the deep end. If he isn't, if he's right about his
deepening suspicions, it's obvious that his increasingly extreme
behavior has scared off any potential allies. As he persists,
things darken. When you think you know where the film is headed,
you tell yourself it can't actually be going there. You'll stick to
see if you're right, or if the film is going to somehow trump you.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Bridges's embattled but possibly unbalanced idealism
keeps us engaged even when his character is pushed into hysteria.
Such is his charm and the weight of decency attached to his
persona. And such is the information that we get from the faces of
Robbins and Cusack that we cling to the belief that the film is not
really headed where it seems headed. In fact, the film makes its
point about denial by nudging us into it, then jolting us with our
realization of our own complacency. The button-pushing is pretty
blatant in ``Arlington Road.'' But thanks mostly to the actors'
ability to bring dimension to their work, you'll keep traveling
down ``Arlington Road'' to what you know will be an explosive
finish.

SEX, COMEDY THE MAIN INGREDIENTS IN `AMERICAN PIE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM SULLIVAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
AMERICAN PIE 
Directed by Paul Weitz, produced by Chris Weitz, starring Jason
Biggs, Shannon Elizabeth, Tara Reid, Natasha Lyonne, Mena Suvari,
Chris Klein and Allison Hedagax. 
Running time: 100 minutes 
Rating: R (Partial nudity, sexual situations, profanity) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This is not the ``American Pie'' you might remember from way
back. No Don McLean, no Chevys to the levee, no good ol' boys
drinkin' whiskey and rye.
</P>
<P>
   This ``American Pie'' is a raunchy, horny-teen movie directed by
Paul Weitz and produced by brother Chris (both of them
screenwriters for ``Antz'') and starring a bunch of no-names. The
title comes from the apple pie one teen's mom lovingly bakes. Jim
has heard from a ``worldly'' friend that the innards of an apple
pie are supposed to feel like a part of a woman where our boy has
never been but yearns to be. So he uses the pie they way young
Portnoy used raw liver in ``Portnoy's Complaint.'' This, by the
way, is a step up from where he is when the movie begins, which is
on his bed doing lewd things with a sock when his father walks in.
</P>
<P>
   ``American Pie'' is gross and tasteless, but so were early John
Waters movies. Waters, though, was an acerbic observer of society;
this high-school romp mixes the gross and tasteless with
sentimental mush. Its makers are aiming straight for the low
budget/high return territory of last summer's ``There's Something
About Mary. The difference is that ``Mary'' was (if overrated)
mostly funny and charming. It even had characters you cared about.
</P>
<P>
   ``American Pie,'' set in a suburban town in Michigan, suffers
from a humor deficit, a character-development problem, and a Simple
Simon plotline. Four virgin guys try to have sex with actual women
before or after their high school prom. An older woman is involved,
which allows the filmmakers to nod to ``The Graduate'' by playing
``Mrs. Robinson'' during the seduction scenes. The Internet is
involved, when a Web-cam inadvertently captures a female
foreign-exchange student (Shannon Elizabeth) in what she thinks is
very private enjoyment of the pornography in a boy's bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   There are premature-ejaculation jokes and bodily-fluid jokes and
potty jokes and immature boys playing with toys. There is a
quasi-serious subplot about the ambivalent Oz (Chris Klein), who
must choose choir (and the choir girl, Heather, played by Mena
Suvari) over lacrosse (and his dumb jock friends).
</P>
<P>
   There are actually a couple of raw, funny moments, none of which
can be described here. They are rare nuggets of intelligence that
draw bursts of subversive yuks the way the old National Lampoon
used to.
</P>
<P>
   Here's an irony for you: The only people this movie might really
appeal to are flesh-and-profanity starved youths who are supposedly
forbidden by the rating code from seeing the darn thing _ at least
until it comes out on video, which should be any week now.
</P>
<P>
   Unless it's a big hit, of course. It just might be: No one
predicted ``There's Something About Mary'' would do boffo box
office, and it's always risky to overestimate the public's taste.

`MOVIE STARS' HAS FUN WITH THE SHOW-BIZ LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, CALIF. _ Litigation and laughter go together like . .
. well, they don't really go together, which may explain why it's
hard to remember Harry Hamlin cracking a smile during his five
years on ``L.A. Law.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Hamlin insists that behind the scenes, he was constantly
trying ``to inject as much humor as I could'' into the somewhat
dour character of attorney Michael Kuzak.
</P>
<P>
   ``But they were always `Down, boy. Down,' ' he recalled
ruefully. ``They didn't want that.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamlin's inner jokester is presumably free to roam in the WB
network's new sitcom, ``Movie Stars,'' a family comedy with a
showbiz twist that premieres Sunday at 9 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``Movie Stars'' revolves around the home life of two actors,
rugged action star Reese Hardin (think Schwarzenegger) and
award-winning Jacey Wyatt (think Streep) who must balance their
Hollywood careers with the demands of raising two children and
coping with Reese's career-challenged brother.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Grant, who plays Jacey, has never starred in a
broadcast network series before, but it could be said she has been
preparing for this role her whole life: She is the daughter of Cary
Grant and Dyan Cannon. (Ironically enough, Hamlin appeared with
Cannon in a TV movie in the 1980s).
</P>
<P>
   Although ``Movie Stars'' is not guaranteed a spot on the WB's
fall schedule, Hamlin and Grant believe the public fascination with
celebrities, and curiosity about their private lives, will draw
viewers to the series.
</P>
<P>
   ``In many respects our lives are very banal, and yet to the
outside world, it appears as though they must be very glamorous,
and there must be a lot of fun and excitement going on all the
time,'' said Hamlin. ``What this show does is it kind of pops the
bubble for an audience that might perceive us as people who don't
put their pants on one leg at a time.''
</P>
<P>
   Though he has never starred in a sitcom before, Hamlin's
breakthrough part was in a comedy, ``Movie Movie,'' Stanley Donen's
hilarious 1978 parody of old boxing films. ``I consider comedy to
be my roots,'' he said. ``In fact, I've been just itching to get
back and do it again.''
</P>
<P>
   Since he left ``L.A. Law'' in 1991, Hamlin has been largely
invisible on television except for a recurring role in the
short-lived ``Ink'' and a handful of movies-of-the-week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had wanted to do something in television after `L.A. Law,'
and have been looking for something for a number of years,'' he
said. ``But because `L.A. Law' was so special, it's a real hard act
to follow, in terms of a drama, unless I were to find something
that David E. Kelley was writing. Something like `Ally McBeal' or
whatever. But I think David's had quite enough of me, so I don't
think that's going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Grant's impressive bloodlines, she arrived late to
acting. She spent her 20s working as a cook and attending Stanford,
eyeing a career in law.
</P>
<P>
   ``All my life, I was expected to act,'' said Grant. ``And I was
so afraid of following in their footsteps. Besides the fact that
they had natural ideas of what they wanted me to be, and a lawyer
was the biggest one.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I tried to play out their stuff, and then I tried lots of
other things, and finally I just, at the insistence of a
girlfriend, took an acting class for fun. And I just loved it, and
I finally felt my whole body kind of settle, and thought: This is
what I want to do.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Movie Stars'' has traveled a long and winding road to the WB
schedule. It was originally slated to air in April _ Hamlin and
Grant spoke to television critics in January _ but did not make it
into the schedule. The WB line is that the network believed a
summer launch would be more advantageous for a new show, since it
wouldn't get lost in the shuffle. Sources also say, however, that
the network was unwilling to bump the successful ``Rescue 77'' to
clear a time slot for ``Movie Stars.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that it's finally going to be on the air, chances are that
WB executives are rooting hard for ``Movie Stars'' to succeed, if
only so the network can broaden its identity. Known for teen-angst
dramas like ``Dawson's Creek,'' ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer,'' and
``Felicity,'' the WB has had far less success developing hit
sitcoms, and would rather not be seen as a one-trick pony. In the
current issue of Broadcasting &AMP; Cable magazine, WB entertainment
president Susanne Daniels says that ``comedy is a major priority.''
</P>
<P>
   There's another reason that ``Movie Stars'' will stand out on
the WB schedule: At 48 and 33, respectively, Hamlin and Grant are
twice the age of most WB stars. ``Well, I guess somebody has to be
out there to sell those disposable diapers,'' joked Hamlin. ``The
denture cream and all that.''

IT'S THE SEASON OF THE RICH IN THE BERKSHIRES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SAM ALLIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREAT BARRINGTON, Mass. _ This is the moment when the Berkshires
shrug off their bucolic irrelevance and seize the summer.
</P>
<P>
   The tribes are all here for the season once again. They wear
their colors on the great lawn at Tanglewood, the back roads of New
Marlborough, and the eateries of this once moribund town.
</P>
<P>
   And this is the weekend when the tribes reach critical mass:
From James Taylor to the Boston Pops, Jacob's Pillow, the
Williamstown Theater Festival, and countless smaller venues, it is
showtime for an aggregation of performing arts unmatched anywhere
else in the country.
</P>
<P>
   But before the arts came the same immutable tides of social
migration that hit the likes of Telluride and Sante Fe. George
Wislocki, president of the Berkshire Natural Resources Council,
delineates them as follows: ``First come the hippies, then the
cunning, the shrewd, the sun-tanned, and finally, the money.''
</P>
<P>
   And new species are appearing on the scene that create an even
richer food chain. Divisions of culture and geography, as well as
persistent rural poverty, still hamstring the region from realizing
its potential. But the Berkshires, as always, are very fine in high
summer.
</P>
<P>
   To begin with, what saves this area from nightmarish excess is
space. Lots of it. The huge swath of green reduces the effect of
the mansions that metastacize throughout the county. This is not
the case in Nantucket and Martha's Vineyard. ``On Martha's
Vineyard, you can't move without treading on Kay Graham,'' says
conductor Andre Previn, who owns a house on the island but adores
Tanglewood, where he has come to conduct and teach for 23 years.
</P>
<P>
   There is no excuse for feeling hemmed in in the Berkshires. The
entire population of Berkshire County is less than 140,000 people.
It still has the same area code that it started with. Granted,
there's a monster of a house on Prospect Hill in Stockbridge that
reportedly cost more than $12 million. But drive 10 miles in almost
any direction and you can get lost fast.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not out every night attacking some new subdivision,''
Wislocki says about his role as guardian of open spaces.
</P>
<P>
   Along with open spaces, the Berkshires have always been defined
by an exotic tribal mix worthy of the Ottoman Empire: artists of
all stripes in Housatonic, acupuncturists in West Stockbridge,
trust fund hippies in Monterey, uber-financiers in Williamstown,
old Yankees in madras at the Lenox Club, hill people in the wilds
of Otis and Becket, musicians everywhere. The rural poor, invisible
from the window of a Lexus, are out here, too.
</P>
<P>
   The newest tribe on the scene are the young Internet swains,
many still in their 20s, who have hatched companies primarily
around Williamstown. These hormonal entrepreneurs add energy and
jobs to a culture still grieving over the seismic departures a
decade ago of General Electric in Pittsfield and Sprague Electric
in North Adams. If the long-term economic effect of this group is
debatable, their injection of moxie and resourcefulness into an
area steeped in self-doubt is not. They represent a healthy
antidote to the passivity of what locals call the ``GE mentality,''
in which a person went seamlessly from high school to the shop
floor for the rest of his or her life.
</P>
<P>
   The glue among them is an impossibly young Matthew Harris, who
at 26 runs Berkshires Capital Investors, a venture fund that
invests only in companies in the Berkshires. Harris works with a
secretary out of a two-room suite above McClelland's Stationery
store in Williamstown and is counseled by a trio of men retired
from very successful careers. His first investment two years ago
was in Tripod, an Internet company cofounded by a Williams
roommate, Bo Peabody, who sold it last year to Lycos for $58
million.
</P>
<P>
   There is also in Great Barrington a group of immigrants from the
Sheffield shop of Hollywood special effects wizard Douglas
Trumbull. Now in their own micro offices here, they are part of
Great Barrington's revival. A decade ago, the main street of the
town looked like Dresden after the firebombing. Today, it is a
vibrant community that hums all year.
</P>
<P>
   Lenox, in contrast, is more of a Potemkin village whose febrile
summer shoppers are nowhere to be found in February. The main
street of Stockbridge suffers from a plague of scented candle and
potpourri shops. The town was in danger of losing the Elm Street
Market, one of its last remaining real stores, until the
Fitzpatrick family, owners of the Red Lion Inn and Country
Curtains, bought it last year in an act of public service.
</P>
<P>
   Last month's opening in North Adams of MASS MoCA, the gigantic
museum of contemporary art, represents a breathtaking
700,000-square-foot roll of the dice for director Joseph Thompson.
But more important, it has changed the social fabric of the ``north
county,'' centered in Williamstown. The new museum has broken what
Thompson calls ``the Maginot line'' that existed for decades
between affluent Williamstown and its blue-collar neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   One of the top curators at Williamstown's superb Clark Museum
recently bought a house in North Adams, as have half a dozen
Williams faculty members. ``This would have been inconceivable a
few years ago,'' says Thompson. North Adams now sports two bed and
breakfasts where there was none two years ago. It even has a hotel
_ a Holiday Inn with the charm of a German pillbox _ but a hotel
nonetheless that does good business.
</P>
<P>
   Such progress is lost, though, on most folks from ``south
county,'' the area below the county's ailing hub of Pittsfield.
This disconnect is due neither to emnity nor to rivalry, at least
for now. Quite simply, it's hard to get from there to here. One
need trail a truck on Route 7, the two-lane spine, only once to
understand why.
</P>
<P>
   But cross-pollination between north and south is also minimal
because the Berkshires remain culturally balkanized. Take the
Tanglewood crowd, the most powerful tribe in the region. ``The
people at Tanglewood have no idea what's going on in the
Berkshires,'' says Nancy Fitzpatrick, a generous patron of the
Boston Symphony and the heir apparent to the family empire.
</P>
<P>
   That's beside the point, counters Previn. ``The Vienna
Philharmonic doesn't care what goes on in Austria.''
</P>
<P>
   And many in the Berkshires have no idea what's going on at
Tanglewood. Susan Sellew, who has made her estimable Monterey
Chevre goat cheese for the likes of Zabar's and Bread &AMP; Circus
since the early '80s on her farm in Monterey, likens the Berkshires
to a city. Put simply, it has its neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Her tiny community, which swells from 920 to 4,000 in the
summer, boasts a general store where a gold BMW might sit next to
an aging pickup. Its bulletin board includes a plea from the
Rosenthals for any news about Sugar, their lost cat, directly
beneath an ad offering screenwriting lessons.
</P>
<P>
   Cabinetmakers mingle easily with arbitrageurs who buy big, quiet
houses. For folks such as Sellew, Tanglewood might as well be in
Wyoming: She milks her goats and listens to concerts on the radio.
(And once, while at her art class in Lee, she helped her daughter
deliver a kid over the phone.)
</P>
<P>
   Sellew's goat gang is a classic Berkshire melange. Her assistant
was a colorist for Marvel comics for 25 years. A Manhattan
therapist used to milk goats for free twice a week for two years.
(Now we know what shrinks do for help.) An ex-magazine editor
cleans the barn.
</P>
<P>
   Even further removed is the Dream Away Lodge in the hill country
of Becket. ``You'll never find this place unless someone takes
you,'' says its new owner, Daniel Osman. Yup. Reputed to have been
a bordello in the '40s, the Dream Away became the stuff of legend
in 1975 when photographer Ken Regan took Bob Dylan's Rolling
Thunder tour there. Mama Frasca, the owner at the time, so
entranced Dylan with her unprompted Italian singing that he
arranged for her to open for him one night at Boston Garden, Regan
said.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the Dream Away is appropriately shabby. It sports some
nifty neon, pictures of Pope John XXIII, Liberace, and the odd
bowling trophy. It is, hands down, the campiest place in the
Berkshires. Perhaps 15 miles from Bisto Zinc, the hottest new
watering hole in Lenox, the Dream Away might as well be on Mars.
</P>
<P>
   One tribe that is lost in the brilliance of the summer season is
the rural poor. Most of the adults among them will never gain the
savvy and confidence to start their own businesses. They are
victims of what economist Joseph Schumpeter once called ``creative
destruction'' as different industries rise and fall. Linda Small,
who runs the Children's Health Program, a Great Barrington
nonprofit, says the focus is on how to prepare the next generation
for the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to get the parents comfortable with the process of
letting their children go, to be as smart as I know they are. It's
a huge struggle,'' she says. ``I love that those smart young things
are starting businesses here. They can help the Berkshires go
through this transition. I hope they're here for our kids. That's
where I'm focusing.''

VENTURA GRAPPLES WITH PEROT TO LEAD REFORM PARTY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ This does not seem like a fair fight: Jesse ``The
Body'' Ventura against Ross ``I'm all ears'' Perot. But in the
lively political contest for leadership of the Reform Party that
Perot founded and to which Ventura gave fame, it is hard to tell
which one is the professional wrestler.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota Governor Ventura, the first candidate elected
statewide on the Reform Party ticket, appears to have won round
one. Perot's handpicked party chairman, Russell Verney, announced
on Wednesday that he would not seek reelection at the party's
national convention July 23 through 25 in Dearborn, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe now is the right time for me to step aside and let
new leadership blossom, and to let those who have been working hard
move up and take over,'' Verney said Thursday in his office at
Perot's headquarters in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Verney insists his decision to resign was made long before June
28, when Ventura sent hundreds of convention delegates an e-mail
endorsing another candidate for chairman _ Jack Gargan of Cedar
Key, Fla. _ and threatening to pack up his star power and stay away
from the national Reform Party if Gargan was not elected.
</P>
<P>
   Nor was Verney persuaded to leave, he said, by Ventura's latest
power play: His very public recruiting of Lowell Weicker, a former
Connecticut governor and senator, to be a Reform Party presidential
candidate in 2000. Weicker, who did not support Perot in his 1992
and 1996 campaigns for the White House, said he ``has no idea'' if
the Texas billionaire would run again, but hoped he would not. ``A
third time and people will just make fun of the Reform Party,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura has been more blunt. In interviews and in his new book,
``I Ain't Got Time to Bleed,'' Ventura has said that for the Reform
Party to survive, the time has come for Perot to go and the guard
to change.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing personal against Perot _ I think he's commendable,''
Ventura wrote in his autobiography, adding that he voted for the
maverick independent twice. ``But for whatever reason, he wants to
remain out front. He's fallen a great distance from the first time
he ran, and he fell again the second time. He had better step aside
in this next election, or the party won't exist anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Steven Schier, chairman of the political science department at
Carleton College and a commentator on Minnesota politics, said
Ventura is using his position as the reigning king of Reform Party
candidates to lead the first serious attempt to wrest control of
the party from Perot and push him out of the picture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perot is entrenched and stubborn, so Jesse, who is about as
subtle as a Mack truck, is hitting the mule over the head with a
board,'' Schier said. ``But this could turn into a free-for-all at
the convention. These are uncharted waters, and it is hard to
believe Perot will go quietly.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, Perot has been very quiet about the whole matter. He did
not answer requests for an interview, and Verney said his boss is
keeping a low profile because ``the future of the Reform Party
depends on tens of thousands of great, hard-working activists, not
on one person's celebrity.''
</P>
<P>
   Perot, who received almost 20 percent of the presidential vote
in 1992 and 8.5 percent in 1996, has not disclosed his intentions
for 2000. Ventura says he will serve out his four-year term in
Minnesota and not run for president next year. Because of Perot's
vote in 1996, the Reform Party's presidential candidate next year
will be eligible for $12.6 million in federal matching funds.
</P>
<P>
   But Perot will be at the national convention, giving the keynote
speech on July 24 and energizing his followers before they vote the
next day on the slate of party officers. Ventura has been offered a
speaking slot on July 23, before many of the delegates arrive.
</P>
<P>
   Gargan, who sought Ventura's endorsement for chairman, says the
schedule of speeches is just one example of how the party
leadership has manipulated rules and procedures to quash anti-Perot
dissent and minimize the governor's role in the national party.
Gargan also is rankled that Perot did not help finance Ventura's
campaign last year, though Verney said the large loan Ventura
sought from Perot would have been illegal under campaign-finance
rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jesse Ventura is the greatest public relations piece the
Reform Party has _ he talks the party talk and walks the walk,''
said Gargan, a Reform Party veteran who has run unsuccessfully for
governor and the US House in Florida. ``But instead of playing him
up to the hilt, our national committee pretends he is not one of
us. What is wrong with this picture?''
</P>
<P>
   Verney says Perot feels ``no rivalry'' with Ventura. ``Ross has
stepped back and taken the focus off himself and let Jesse run with
no interference,'' said Verney, who was born in Brighton and at one
time was executive director of the New Hampshire Democratic Party.
``Ventura tells Perot to `get out of the way.' Well, who has stood
in Jesse's way, who has impeded him in the least?''
</P>
<P>
   But analysts say the Reform Party, which was born as a vanity
plate for Perot and then grew on good-government issues such as
campaign finance reform and term limits, is at a crossroads. Will
it become a functional third party, fielding candidates at all
levels of government, or will it remain a vessel for the
presidential ambitions of outsiders like Ventura and Perot?
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is, will the Reform Party become a real third
party with some potential, or does it continue to be Ross Perot's
toy,'' said Sandy Maisel, a government professor at Colby College.
``The significance of Ventura's victory is that it gives the party
an opportunity to become something other than one person's vehicle
for salving an ego.''

A PICTURE-PERFECT WEDDING AND THEN DISASTER _ AND HELP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By YVONNE ABRAHAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Frank and Suzanne Chandler had a beautiful wedding _ a wedding
that went off so perfectly, it was impossible to imagine the
disasters that would follow.
</P>
<P>
   But follow they did. The wedding from heaven spawned the
aftermath from hell. Photographs went missing. Presents were
destroyed. A precious ring was lost.
</P>
<P>
   Such a string of disasters might be looked back on with sadness
and regret, or provide entertaining tales at dinner parties. But
this Boston couple decided to fight the fates.
</P>
<P>
   And they did it with some snap-happy friends, two floods (one
with sewage), a man willing to comb the bottom of a muddy lake for
a wedding ring, and a miracle.
</P>
<P>
   The Chandlers were married on Sunday, May 24, 1998, in a
200-year-old synagogue on St. Thomas. The sun hung low in an orange
sky. The ocean sparkled. Afterward, a private boat took the
newlyweds and their 50 guests to the island of St. John for the
reception. Later, they went to Duffy's Love Shack for drinks and
cigars, where Frank Chandler bought a baseball cap as a souvenir.
The honeymoon on St. Maarten? Also perfect.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was wonderful,'' said Chandler. ``Everything about it was
beautiful. We should never have left.''
</P>
<P>
   Not until the Chandlers were switching planes in Puerto Rico did
things begin to fall apart.
</P>
<P>
   They had put all the professional photographs from the wedding,
including negatives and the only video, with their cameras in their
hand luggage. ``I wanted to keep it all in my hands,'' Chandler
said.
</P>
<P>
   There was little time and much confusion between planes.
</P>
<P>
   Chandler put his carry-on on a conveyor belt, thinking it was
going to be X-rayed. But the bag was actually headed for oblivion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Next thing I know the bag is going into the bowels of Puerto
Rico,'' Chandler said. The plane was leaving, and attendants urged
him to board.
</P>
<P>
   He admits he caused a scene. ``Everything I hold dear is in that
bag,'' he told American Airlines officials. ``I'm going to be very
uncomfortable without that bag.'' They persuaded him to board
anyway. They arrived at Logan Airport, but the bag _ and all the
photographs _ didn't. The airline was unable to locate it.
</P>
<P>
   Suzanne Chandler cried for a long time.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks later, their one-bedroom basement apartment, in which
all the wedding presents had been piled on the floor, flooded when
sewers backed up.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a foot of water in the apartment,'' Chandler said.
``Except I wish it were only water.'' Most of the presents were
ruined. And because the water had come up from the sewer, instead
of down from the sky, insurance covered none of it.
</P>
<P>
   On July Fourth of last year, Frank Chandler's parents threw a
wedding party for them in Maine. Before the party, the couple took
a Jet Ski out on Salmon Lake, in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Turns out this was not a good idea.
</P>
<P>
   Chandler's Duffy's Love Shack cap blew off. He turned around to
get it, and flipped the Jet Ski. He and Suzanne fell, fully
clothed, into the middle of the lake. The Jet Ski, still running,
hummed in slow circles around them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going round and round and round,'' Chandler said. ``I'm
pushing my wife away so she doesn't get sucked into the engine, and
with my right hand, I'm trying to reach under the Jet Ski to get
the key out.''
</P>
<P>
   Just then, his wedding ring, a specially designed ring made of
platinum and yellow gold and engraved with their wedding date, a
ring Suzanne had persuaded him to splurge on because it was
forever, slipped off. It fell to the bottom of a lake which is 57
feet deep in parts. That wasn't covered by insurance either.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point,'' Chandler said, ``we sit back and evaluate our
world. We are living under a black cloud. We have to take steps to
change these bad things, one at a time.''
</P>
<P>
   Then the breaks started to go their way.
</P>
<P>
   They had friends send them all the snapshots they could find of
the wedding, and ended up with 400 pictures.
</P>
<P>
   There was another flood a couple of months after the first one.
But this time, because a boiler broke, the new damage was covered
by insurance. The wedding presents were long gone, but the money
was a victory of sorts.
</P>
<P>
   Two down. The ring was more of a challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know where it is,'' Chandler, a certified diver, said he
told friends. ``It's in that lake. There's no current, nobody's
going to take it, it's just going to sit there in the mud till we
find it.''
</P>
<P>
   At first he wanted to dive with a metal detector himself, but
local dive shops all pointed him to Richard Carney, known locally
as The Man Who Can Find Anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me make this clear,'' Chandler said. ``At this point,
people think I am insane. We're at a point where Frank the fool who
lost his wedding band is now Frank the bigger fool who's gonna go
and find it.''
</P>
<P>
   Carney, unlike the many friends and family members who ribbed
Chandler mercilessly for months, never doubted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have the gift,'' Carney said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the time, he fixes faxes and copy machines. But in real
life, Carney, whose boat is called Finders Keepers, finds long-lost
jewels and other treasures, not just in water, but in dumps and
houses, too.
</P>
<P>
   He went down into Salmon Lake last October, without success. The
weeds were too thick. And the Chandlers couldn't agree on where the
Jet Ski had dropped them.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend, Chandler, not the kind of man who gives up, and
Carney, whose reputation was on the line, went back to the lake.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's dive brought no joy, except to the many friends and
strangers who had gathered on shore to laugh at the quixotic search
for the tiny ring in the huge 666-acre lake.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, they tried again, in a different spot.
</P>
<P>
   Down Carney went. In less than 10 minutes, he surfaced,
triumphant, with ring _ a full year after it was lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rick Carney is the greatest guy that ever lived,'' Chandler
said.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Chandler doesn't have his wedding ring right now. It is at
the jeweler, being buffed, and sized so it doesn't slip off again.
And engraved with another date: July 4th, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the date my ring was reborn,'' Chandler said. ``And
that's the date my wife and I start our lives again.''

BOOKER T AND THE MG'S LAY ON THE FUNK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For hired guns, there are none better than Booker T &AMP; the MG's.
They were the house band for the famous Stax/Volt label in Memphis,
backing Otis Redding, Wilson Pickett, and Sam &AMP; Dave. They were the
house band for Bob Dylan's 30th anniversary concert. They've been
the house band for the Rock Hall of Fame concerts _ and they backed
Neil Young on a world tour six years ago. Along the way, they've
backed Eric Clapton and John Fogerty.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Booker T &AMP; the MG's rarely tour, which makes it even
more special that they're coming to the Winter Island Blues
Festival in Salem, Mass. Saturday. They're on a richly enticing
bill with the Derek Trucks Band, Jazz is Dead, Entrain, the Miracle
Orchestra, Another Planet, and Mr. Airplane Man.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't get up in your area too much. We've been mainly on
the West Coast,'' says MG's rhythm guitarist Steve Cropper, who is
also in the Blues Brothers Band. ``But really, in the whole life of
Booker T &AMP; the MG's, we never toured much, except on a small basis.
The biggest tour we ever did was with Neil Young when we played
with him six weeks in Europe and six weeks here.''
</P>
<P>
   On their own, Booker T &AMP; the MG's are an instrumental band known
for such hits as ``Green Onions,'' ``Hip Hug-Her,'' and ``Soul
Dressing.'' They were the backbone of funky '60s and '70s R&AMP;B,
before disco swept a lot of that away.
</P>
<P>
   As Cropper notes sardonically, ``R&AMP;B didn't die. Radio killed
it. But thank God today for oldies-but-goodies stations.''
</P>
<P>
   The classic MG's sound can be appreciated in the three-CD box
set ``Time is Tight,'' released last year on the Stax/Fantasy
label.
</P>
<P>
   Cropper, who has co-written such tunes as ``(Sitting On) the
Dock of the Bay'' with Otis Redding, ``Knock on Wood'' with Eddie
Floyd, and ``In the Midnight Hour'' (with Wilson Pickett), has
remastered some of those hits and reissued them on a solo album,
``Play It Again, Steve!'' It's available through his web site at
www.playitagainsteve.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hoping to get Booker T &AMP; the MG's to do something similar
and put that out through the Internet,'' says Cropper.
</P>
<P>

   More on Mark Sandman: ``It was a beautiful night. We were
rocking and felt back in the groove,'' says Morphine saxophonist
Dana Colley, recalling last Saturday's gig at a festival outside of
Rome, where singer Mark Sandman died of a heart attack on stage.
``Mark crouched and stopped playing for a couple of minutes, and I
thought he was waiting for the groove to happen,'' says Colley.
Sandman then fell and knocked over a vase of flowers that drummer
Billy Conway always keeps on his drum riser. ``Mark's butt was on
his amp, his guitar was around his shoulders, and he had flowers
all around him,'' says Carrie Svingen, a longtime aide to the band.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two nights before in Portugal, it was 100 degrees at sound
check and Mark said, `I almost fainted,' '' recalls Colley. ``So,
in Italy, I didn't think much of it at first. I thought he just
fainted, because it was kind of warm.'' Sandman died during the
band's second song, not long after he had recited in Italian the
lyrics to his song, ``Mona's Sister.'' Says Colley: ``Mark spent
all day translating them and you could see that the crowd really
appreciated that he made the attempt.''
</P>
<P>
   A cardiac specialist was on the scene immediately, says Colley.
So was the police. They searched the band's belongings and later
searched Sandman's room looking for drugs, as if they could have
been the cause of death. ``It added insult to injury,'' says
Colley. ``But I guess they were just doing their police work.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ultimately impossible to put into a sound bite what I
feel about Mark,'' Colley adds. ``I owe everything to him, and
we're just going to try to see Mark's vision through.'' A new
Morphine live album will be released in October, followed by a
just-completed studio album next year. ``Mark had just sequenced
the songs for it,'' Colley says.

 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAFAYETTE, Calif. _ There are scads of things to get irritated
about these days. I'm the irritable type, so selecting one is no
problem, be it the government, school shootings, pollution, ethnic
cleansing, the plight of the poor or any of dozens of festering
situations.
</P>
<P>
   These are major enigmas, studied and analyzed and quarreled over
by savants and seers and navel observers and numbers-crunchers and
politicians who blanket the Sunday interview shows.
</P>
<P>
   I am, however, to quote Uriah Heep, ``an 'umble person,'' so I
select a quite minor, unimportant topic on which to vent my 'umble
rage: TV cooking shows.
</P>
<P>
   First, the proliferation. It's the American way to overdo
anything that seems to catch the public attention.
</P>
<P>
   I believe Julia Child started it all, probably during the Civil
War. Next came Jeff Smith, ``The Frugal Gourmet,'' whose shtick was
simple fare, low cost and whimsical commentary.
</P>
<P>
   Success changed the formula to international excursions, a huge
staff, books and famous guests. It also brought legal entanglements
over dicey morals charges; Smith seems to have disappeared from the
kitchen. Julia, bless her heart, still props herself on the counter
while guest chefs bake toothsome tarts and cakes and breads.
</P>
<P>
   But the floodgates had been opened. In a five-day period picked
at random, newspaper listings showed 23 different food shows on TV
(42 in all because some appear more than once.) Our TV pot runneth
over.
</P>
<P>
   Now if every one of these offered useful tips on good stuff I
can cook, or better ways to cook what I now serve, I'd say go for
it. (Yes, I am the cook in my house; my sainted wife cooked for
four hungry men for more than 30 years and gladly relinquished the
stove to me.)
</P>
<P>
   But the show-biz virus has infected the entire system, the end
result being culinary razzle-dazzle signifying little besides how
complicated and artsy-crafty a noble profession can get.
</P>
<P>
   Take the personnel. Julia can be excused her use of an aide;
she's 87 and can't handle the physical effort. But most of the
shows have deemed it necessary to have one or more so-called
assistants, most of them total klutzes, I suppose to demonstrate
the skill of the headliner.
</P>
<P>
   Jacques Pepin is a kitchen magician with great ideas, simple
recipes and fabulous technique. As a solo he was everybody's idol,
but for some reason his daughter Claudine was added to the cast.
</P>
<P>
   She's inept, clumsy, generally without a clue but, in somebody's
twisted view, gives the show variety.
</P>
<P>
   Another show has an attractive, knowledgeable British woman,
trying to give recipes but drowned out by a lanky, clueless,
blabbermouthed kid with stupid questions and stupider gags. There
are a few solo chefs but they're increasingly in the minority.
</P>
<P>
   Let's consider the food. Certainly food should be pleasingly
presented, but on most TV shows contrived constructions on the
plate tend to mask what's to be eaten.
</P>
<P>
   Altitude is paramount. If a dish has some veggies with the
entree, they are mounded in the middle, then the meat or fish
elements are carefully stacked on end atop the mound, as high as
possible. Usually a cap of shredded, deep- fried something is
precariously balanced at the pinnacle as the camera moves in. They
don't dare move the plate or it'll collapse.
</P>
<P>
   Sauces are hardly ever put on the food; they're squirted around
the edges in little blobs. Same goes for desserts; the sauces (at
least three of different colors) are dribbled in random patterns
over the plate, the dessert plopped in the middle, and the same
balancing act done with cookies or mint sprigs.
</P>
<P>
   As for ingredients, there is a list of essentials in all TV
cookery: kosher or sea salt, arugula, cilantro, mango chutney,
heavy cream, a dozen egg yolks, goat cheese and a blow torch for
caramelizing sugar on top of whatever dessert.
</P>
<P>
   Settings range from a small kitchen, where a sincere young woman
expresses enthusiasm over heaps of coarsely chopped, meatless items
for gigantic vegetarian dinners, to the huge amphitheater of the
Culinary Institute of America. There platoons of would-be chefs,
all in starched smocks and tall chef's hats, sit high above the
demonstration table, for all the world like the operating room of a
major hospital, watching an instructor (read doctor) ponderously
process a partridge Provencal (read coronary transplant).
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps I overcavil. There are a few good tips to be gleaned.
</P>
<P>
   Have sharp knives. Fold in your whipped cream or beaten egg
whites gently. Don't test the temperature of hot oil with your
finger. Don't cook with wine you wouldn't drink.
</P>
<P>
   Here's one I learned just the other day, really helpful. If you
want to separate the leaves of iceberg lettuce (an abomination to
the heavy breathers, but I love it), hold the head in both hands
and bang the core end violently on your cutting board or sink.
</P>
<P>
   The core will pop loose from the leaves and can be pulled out
easily, the leaves flapping freely and ready for use in whatever
manner. Try it.
</P>

   LAFAYETTE, Calif. _ There are scads of things to get irritated
about these days. I'm the irritable type, so selecting one is no
problem, be it the government, school shootings, pollution, ethnic
cleansing, the plight of the poor or any of dozens of festering
situations.
</P>
<P>
   These are major enigmas, studied and analyzed and quarreled over
by savants and seers and navel observers and numbers-crunchers and
politicians who blanket the Sunday interview shows.
</P>
<P>
   I am, however, to quote Uriah Heep, ``an 'umble person,'' so I
select a quite minor, unimportant topic on which to vent my 'umble
rage: TV cooking shows.
</P>
<P>
   First, the proliferation. It's the American way to overdo
anything that seems to catch the public attention.
</P>
<P>
   I believe Julia Child started it all, probably during the Civil
War. Next came Jeff Smith, ``The Frugal Gourmet,'' whose shtick was
simple fare, low cost and whimsical commentary.
</P>
<P>
   Success changed the formula to international excursions, a huge
staff, books and famous guests. It also brought legal entanglements
over dicey morals charges; Smith seems to have disappeared from the
kitchen. Julia, bless her heart, still props herself on the counter
while guest chefs bake toothsome tarts and cakes and breads.
</P>
<P>
   But the floodgates had been opened. In a five-day period picked
at random, newspaper listings showed 23 different food shows on TV
(42 in all because some appear more than once.) Our TV pot runneth
over.
</P>
<P>
   Now if every one of these offered useful tips on good stuff I
can cook, or better ways to cook what I now serve, I'd say go for
it. (Yes, I am the cook in my house; my sainted wife cooked for
four hungry men for more than 30 years and gladly relinquished the
stove to me.)
</P>
<P>
   But the show-biz virus has infected the entire system, the end
result being culinary razzle-dazzle signifying little besides how
complicated and artsy-crafty a noble profession can get.
</P>
<P>
   Take the personnel. Julia can be excused her use of an aide;
she's 87 and can't handle the physical effort. But most of the
shows have deemed it necessary to have one or more so-called
assistants, most of them total klutzes, I suppose to demonstrate
the skill of the headliner.
</P>
<P>
   Jacques Pepin is a kitchen magician with great ideas, simple
recipes and fabulous technique. As a solo he was everybody's idol,
but for some reason his daughter Claudine was added to the cast.
</P>
<P>
   She's inept, clumsy, generally without a clue but, in somebody's
twisted view, gives the show variety.
</P>
<P>
   Another show has an attractive, knowledgeable British woman,
trying to give recipes but drowned out by a lanky, clueless,
blabbermouthed kid with stupid questions and stupider gags. There
are a few solo chefs but they're increasingly in the minority.
</P>
<P>
   Let's consider the food. Certainly food should be pleasingly
presented, but on most TV shows contrived constructions on the
plate tend to mask what's to be eaten.
</P>
<P>
   Altitude is paramount. If a dish has some veggies with the
entree, they are mounded in the middle, then the meat or fish
elements are carefully stacked on end atop the mound, as high as
possible. Usually a cap of shredded, deep- fried something is
precariously balanced at the pinnacle as the camera moves in. They
don't dare move the plate or it'll collapse.
</P>
<P>
   Sauces are hardly ever put on the food; they're squirted around
the edges in little blobs. Same goes for desserts; the sauces (at
least three of different colors) are dribbled in random patterns
over the plate, the dessert plopped in the middle, and the same
balancing act done with cookies or mint sprigs.
</P>
<P>
   As for ingredients, there is a list of essentials in all TV
cookery: kosher or sea salt, arugula, cilantro, mango chutney,
heavy cream, a dozen egg yolks, goat cheese and a blow torch for
caramelizing sugar on top of whatever dessert.
</P>
<P>
   Settings range from a small kitchen, where a sincere young woman
expresses enthusiasm over heaps of coarsely chopped, meatless items
for gigantic vegetarian dinners, to the huge amphitheater of the
Culinary Institute of America. There platoons of would-be chefs,
all in starched smocks and tall chef's hats, sit high above the
demonstration table, for all the world like the operating room of a
major hospital, watching an instructor (read doctor) ponderously
process a partridge Provencal (read coronary transplant).
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps I overcavil. There are a few good tips to be gleaned.
</P>
<P>
   Have sharp knives. Fold in your whipped cream or beaten egg
whites gently. Don't test the temperature of hot oil with your
finger. Don't cook with wine you wouldn't drink.
</P>
<P>
   Here's one I learned just the other day, really helpful. If you
want to separate the leaves of iceberg lettuce (an abomination to
the heavy breathers, but I love it), hold the head in both hands
and bang the core end violently on your cutting board or sink.
</P>
<P>
   The core will pop loose from the leaves and can be pulled out
easily, the leaves flapping freely and ready for use in whatever
manner. Try it.
</P>

ENVIRONMENTALISTS JETTISON SUPPORT FOR FERRY FLEET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANITA WADHWANI  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Environmentalists are withdrawing their support
for an extensive ferry system to operate in the San Francisco Bay
because a study concluded that the fleet would cause more pollution
than the car and bus traffic it was designed to replace.
</P>
<P>
   Diesel-powered ferries emit 10 times more air pollution per
passenger-mile than automobiles and 23 times more than transit
buses, according to the preliminary report released Thursday by the
San Francisco environmental group Bluewater Network.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is: Are Bay Area residents willing to increase
air pollution to decrease congestion?'' said Russell Long,
executive director of the Bluewater Network. ``We can't afford to
take a romantic view of ferries anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   The Audubon Society, Save the Bay and Clean Water Action are
joining the Bluewater Network in calling on state Sen. Don Perata,
D-Alameda, to reconsider his bill that would get the ball rolling
on a massive expansion in ferry commuter services.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of ferry expansion and Perata's bill say that the
environmental concerns are premature, narrowly focused and based on
worst-case scenarios.
</P>
<P>
   The disagreement comes at a time when ferry services are
increasingly seen as a traffic-busting alternative for commuters in
the Bay area. Last week, Gov. Gray Davis announced $6 million in
state funds toward the purchase of a new ferry for the Bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's odd to be criticized for work that has yet to be done,''
said Russell Hancock of the Bay Area Council, a nonprofit public
policy organization. Hancock managed an 18-month task force of city
representatives, transportation officials and environmentalists
that proposed a $2 billion, 120-ferry plan.
</P>
<P>
   The plan envisions an extensive network of ferries and terminals
connecting far-flung points around the Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Hancock also called into question the report's focus on
diesel-engine ferries, adding that the Bluewater Network was making
assumptions about what types of boats would be used.
</P>
<P>
   Hancock said the Perata bill would be a first step by
establishing a new water transit authority that would take on
detailed planning responsibilities, including environmental
assessments.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental critics of the ferry plan said a new authority was
unneeded.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the environmental impacts are as significant as we think
they will be, then it raises serious questions about whether we
should have the water transit authority,'' said David Lewis of Save
the Bay.
</P>
<P>
   The group was part of the task force and initially supported the
ferry expansion plan as an environmentally friendly alternative to
vehicle commutes. Save the Bay withdrew its support because of the
findings in the Bluewater Network report.
</P>
<P>
   None of the environmental groups; representatives raised
questions about air quality while on the task force, Lewis said.
``I think everyone on the task force shares responsibility for not
asking that question,'' he said.

   SPRAWL _ AUSTIN, Texas _ (first in an occasional series) Hoping
to tap into the increasingly large suburban portion of the
electorate, Vice President Al Gore is determined to make so-called
``urban sprawl'' a major issue in the 2000 presidential campaign.
After nearly a decade of economic growth, Gore is betting that
quality of life issues such as traffic and unfettered development _
traditionally dealt with on the local level _ will resonate in a
national campaign. There is evidence to support his strategy: More
than half of the nation's governors mentioned ``sprawl'' or ``Smart
Growth'' in their inaugural speeches. Texas Gov. George W. Bush,
Gore's likely opponent in the general election, wasn't one of them.
Although Austinites are all-too-familiar with development debates,
most famously independent Texans aren't too concerned _ although
that may be changing _ and Bush has been virtually mum on the
issue. What is Bush's view on sprawl? Does the federal government
have a legitimate role to play? (Greenberger, Austin
American-Statesman). 50. WITH PHOTO, LOGO

   FORBES _ ATLANTA _ Steve Forbes is coming here again Friday.

   OZONE _ WASHINGTON _ Scientists from the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration, along with researchers from other
federal agencies and universities, will begin an intensive program
this month to monitor the level of ozone in the air in the region
of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park in Tennessee. The area
has been plagued with stubborn, health-threatening levels of
summertime photochemical smog for the last several years. Purpose
of the monitoring will be to develop more accurate forecasts so
susceptible people can be warned to stay away and to identify
sources, some of which may be distant pollution generators, NOAA
said. (Nesmith, Cox News Service).

World's oldest synagogues, a crumbling structure in the U.S. Virgin
Islands held together by limestone-and-molasses mortar, is due for
a makeover. Worshipers at the Blessing and Peace and Loving Deeds
synagogue on St. Thomas say the $350,000 renovation, due to begin
in June 1999, will restore some of the building's original beauty
lost through years of decomposing plaster. The site, which dates
from 1833, is the oldest continuously used synagogue under the
American flag. Jews settled on St. Thomas beginning in 1665.

   CHARLOTTE AMALIE, U.S. Virgin Islands _ Imagine it's the late
1600s.
</P>
<P>
   The island of St. Thomas is populated by runaway slaves,
shipwrecked sailors, and soldiers who spend much of their time in a
fog from drinking a witches' brew called Kill Devil Rum.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of this patchwork of personalities is a smattering
of European Jews seeking to eke out a living as shopkeepers and
small landowners after fleeing the Spanish Inquisition.
</P>
<P>
   The Jews of St. Thomas flourish, bolstered by other Jews from
Brazil and Portugal also seeking refuge from persecution.
</P>
<P>
   By 1796, they raise an astounding $3,476 to build their first
synagogue, a Spanish Moorish structure that is eventually replaced
by something more spacious. But that synagogue -- and then another
-- are destroyed by fire.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in 1833, the Jews build the ``Holy Congregation of
Blessing and Peace and Loving Deeds.''
</P>
<P>
   It's this synagogue that still stands, appropriately atop the
steep Synagogue Hill, as a testament to the Caribbean's stature as
a tolerant haven for Jews.
</P>
<P>
   But the synagogue, like the congregation it supports, has
suffered with age.
</P>
<P>
   The number of families that belong to the Hebrew congregation
has fallen from 200 in 1993 to about 120 today. Young people have
gone away to college in the United States and never come back;
other people have fled St. Thomas since Hurricane Marilyn
devastated much of the island in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   This week, though, a massive project to restore the synagogue's
original beauty got underway, a restoration that's part of an
ongoing effort by Jewish families here to preserve their heritage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want the synagogue to look the way it used to . . . we want
to restore the synagogue's original integrity,'' said architect
Bill Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   The $350,000 makeover is expected to be completed by December.
</P>
<P>
   The structure is the oldest continually used synagogue under the
American flag. It is the third-oldest synagogue in the Western
Hemisphere after a temple built in 1732 on the Dutch Caribbean
island of Curacao and a 1763 synagogue in Newport, R.I.
</P>
<P>
   The congregation also boasts that its synagogue held the first
confirmation ceremony for Jewish youth in the Western Hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   The historical significance of the building, with its arched
window frames and original mahogany pews, has smitten visitors for
decades.
</P>
<P>
   The menorah behind the bima, or pulpit, is of Spanish origin and
dates from the 11th century. And the ark contains six Torah
scrolls, three of them Sephardic, the others Ashkenazic. Two of
them are more than 200 years old.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a Czech memorial scroll, one of the few to survive
the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   All are part of a Jewish legacy little-known to many Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Historians believe that Jews first settled on St. Thomas as
early as 1665, with many reaching the Caribbean -- including such
islands as Curacao -- via Holland, which had opened its doors to
Jews after winning its 80-year battle with Spain.
</P>
<P>
   Holland urged the Jews to settle in the deserted West Indian
islands Holland hoped to control. Those who did soon found work as
shop owners or participants in the region's rum, sugar, and
molasses businesses.
</P>
<P>
   A real influx of Jews to St. Thomas occurred in the 1780s, when
Jews on the Dutch island of St. Eustatius fled here after the
British attacked that island in reprisal for the islanders' aid to
the American forces during the Revolutionary War.
</P>
<P>
   The painter Camille Pissarro was born on St. Thomas in 1830 and
worshipped at the synagogue with his parents before moving to
Europe where he became a leader in the Impressionist movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The history of Jews in North America begins in the Caribbean,
although not a lot of people know about this,'' said Leon
Weissberg, executive director of the Jewish Education Commission, a
division of the Jewish Federation of South Palm Beach County in
Delray Beach, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   He said Jews from the Caribbean first reached Florida in the
1700s, settling both in Key West and Pensacola in Florida's
Panhandle.
</P>
<P>
   ``At one time, Pensacola's was the largest Jewish community in
the South outside of Savannah (Ga.),'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Weissberg added that the renovation of the synagogue on St.
Thomas is vital to preserving an important testament to the faith
of the early Jewish settlers.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly time -- as well as a string of hurricanes -- have
taken their toll on the synagogue.
</P>
<P>
   It stands in the heart of Charlotte Amalie, known for its narrow
winding streets and the European ambiance of its colonial
buildings. Just a short walk away is a Jewish cemetery, which
includes tombstones dating from 1792.
</P>
<P>
   In 1972, the building's walls were stripped of their crumbling
plaster, leaving worshippers to gather within exposed brick and
stone walls. Over the years, salt trapped under layers of sealant
have begun corroding these walls, which were constructed from local
rock and European brick that ships brought to the island as
ballast.
</P>
<P>
   The cement that holds the bricks together is a mortar made from
sand, limestone, and molasses. It is said that, in earlier years,
children used to lick the walls of the synagogue to taste the sweet
molasses.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the renovation, the walls will -- again -- be covered
in plaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``The exposed brick just didn't work too well,'' said office
manager Roy McMaster. ``Now the walls will be entirely white
again.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the walls, the restoration also will include:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The cleaning of four pillars, handmade in Denmark from rounded
bricks, that support the entrance;
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  restoration of European chandeliers, a few of which are still
lit by candles on special holidays;
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  and replacing of the synagogue's ark, constructed with plaster
and a finish of faux wood and marble, with one fashioned from real
marble and real mahogany.
</P>
<P>
   But the structure's sand-covered floor, perhaps its
most-striking feature, will not be touched.
</P>
<P>
   The floor's meaning can be traced to the Sephardic Jews of
Spain. Those Jews had been given a horrific choice: either convert
to Catholicism or face a torturous death at the hands of the
Inquisition. Those who chose to stay -- and stay Jewish -- used
sand on the floor to muffle the sounds of their movements during
prayer so as not to be discovered.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea is to pay tribute to those who came before,''
McMaster said. ``We don't want to do anything that would change
that.''
</P>
<P>
   For your information: To contribute money to the restoration
project, send checks to the Hebrew Congregation, P.O. Box 266, St.
Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands, 00804.

TWO MEN CHARGED IN DEATHS OF GAY COUPLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Two brothers who are believed to be white
supremacists were arrested Thursday in connection with the shooting
deaths of a gay couple outside their rural Northern California
home.
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin Matthew Williams, 31, and James Tyler Williams, 29, are
accused of killing Gary Matson, 50, and Winfield Scott Mowder, 40,
the Shasta County Sheriff's Department said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The bodies of Matson and Mowder were found early Thursday in the
mobile home they shared on a five-acre plot in Happy Valley, a
community about 15 miles southwest of Redding.
</P>
<P>
   There was no obvious sign of forced entry and nothing of value
inside the home appeared to be missing, the authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Matson's car _ a copper-colored, four-door 1987 Toyota Tercel
station wagon _ had been abandoned a day earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The deputies said in a press release that evidence in the car,
along with leads they already had, led investigators to identify
the Williams brothers as suspects.
</P>
<P>
   Deputies found ``information and literature'' in the home of the
two brothers that suggests they subscribed to racist beliefs,
according to a statement from the Sheriff's Department.

NO `HAMMING' IT UP FOR AMERICAN SOCCER STAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ARTHUR GARCIA  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ They'll sit knee-deep in canned hams, armed with
hammers and draped Hamm T-shirts in a section of 120 Hamm
supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Bill and Stephanie Hamm, parents of the face of American soccer,
left their South Austin home Friday for Pasadena, Calif. On
Saturday, they'll become a part of the largest women's sports event
in recent history _ the Women's World Cup soccer championship at
the Rose Bowl. And their daughter, Mariel Margaret Hamm, had a
major hand _ make that foot _ in making the World Cup a global
phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, Bill and Stephanie Hamm have felt the glow of the media
spotlight that usually falls on their 27-year-old daughter, the
soccer icon better known as Mia.
</P>
<P>
   With the World Cup in the United States and the Americans cast
as favorites against China, much attention has been centered on all
that is the U.S. team.
</P>
<P>
   Bill and Stephanie Hamm have received quite a few calls during
the three-week tournament and, in turn, have taken time to reflect
on Mia Hamm's journey.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ever since she started at 5 or 6, she played to win,''
Stephanie said Thursday afternoon, taking time from her work with
the Center for Public Policy Priorities in Austin. Bill Hamm makes
the daily commute to Universal City for his job at Boeing
Aerospace.
</P>
<P>
   As a child, more often than not, the young Mia Hamm played on
teams made up predominantly of boys.
</P>
<P>
   ``She would put her entire body and persona in the game,'' her
father said. ``It wasn't like win at all costs, but she didn't
consider the alternative of losing. If she had something to do with
it, if she could affect the outcome, then she would do whatever it
took.''
</P>
<P>
   Mia Hamm's still doing the same as the primary cog in a U.S.
team that's reached the Cup finals. The U.S. won the initial Cup in
1991 and is the defending Olympic champion, claiming the gold
before record crowds in Atlanta in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The success of the '96 Games proved the catalyst for the current
Cup craze, dovetailing with Mia Hamm's emergence on the national
sports scene. Her scope is felt within the sport _ she was the
Women's Sports Foundation Athlete of the Year in '97 _ and outside
as well. People Magazine named Mia Hamm one of the 50 Most
Beautiful People the same year.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally reserved, the well-spoken Mia Hamm handles the
notoriety smoothly. But she's still uncomfortable receiving the
lion's share of attention.

   ``She wished that that weren't necessarily so,'' her mother
said. ``She's become the focal point, but I think she does honestly
wish that people would talk to everybody. And I think that's really
happened in this World Cup. I think the personalities of every one
of those women have come out and they're all great. You couldn't
ask for better friends for a daughter.''
</P>
<P>
   During the Cup, Mia Hamm's story has brought added attention to
another important facet of her life _ raising awareness and funding
for bone-marrow testing. Her older brother, Garrett, died two years
ago at age 28 after complications from a seemingly successful
bone-marrow transplant.
</P>
<P>
   Garrett, a Thai-American orphan adopted by the Hamms when he was
8, lived most of his life with aplastic anemia, a rare blood
disorder. He served as his sister's athletic role model and he's
the reason she began playing soccer.
</P>
<P>
   Mia Hamm now serves on the board of The Marrow Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're glad that everyone can see all of her sides, not just
the soccer-playing side or giving good interviews after matches,''
her father said. ``Also the compassionate side with her
foundation.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the 90,000 in the Rose Bowl for Saturday's match will be
120 Hamms, Dillons (Stephanie Hamm's maiden name) and friends.
That's four rows of 30 strong.

   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ Sometime in mid-January, a farmer in West
Flanders noticed that some of his chicken eggs had failed to hatch.
</P>
<P>
   From the ones that did hatch emerged deformed chicks. He called
a veterinary inspector, who had the eggs and chicks tested. To the
inspector's shock, the tests revealed dioxin -- a notorious
carcinogen -- in concentrations several hundred times greater than
accepted levels. Thus began what some Belgians call
``Chicken-Gate,'' a complex affair that helped bring down a
government and ended the career of a veteran prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   It also set off a chain of events that so far has cost
Atlanta-based Coca-Cola Co. $60 million and incalculable damage to
its image.
</P>
<P>
   The Belgian food scandal, which is highlighted by nightly news
footage of piles of pink chicken and pig carcasses buried in pits,
has reverberated far beyond the borders of this country of 10
million.
</P>
<P>
   Across Europe fears about food and drink have become a potent
force in the '90s, dividing nations, terminating political careers
and making every sip and bite an unappetizing source of
contemplation.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Coca-Cola with a lapse in quality control sufficient
enough to make some of its bottles and cans to smell and taste like
rotten eggs.
</P>
<P>
   Coke's misadventure came with the a public in near panic and a
discredited government grasping for the appearance of competence
and honesty.
</P>
<P>
   These virtues seemed sorely missing in the government's handling
of the dioxin crisis, which came to light months after the initial
discovery when the news was broken by a television reporter. The
level of outrage among the public simmered to full boil by late
spring.
</P>
<P>
   Voters vented their fury at the polls June 13, ending the
government of Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene(CQ, the respected
politician who held together a fractious coalition for seven years.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the crisis, government ministers dropped like dinner
chickens. In late May with the chaos in full blossom, Luc Van den
Bossche, a dour, battle-tested bureaucrat and deputy prime
minister, was assigned to fill the vacant posts atop the ministries
of environment, social affairs and health.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks after the chain-smoking former prosecutor was
parachuted in to sort out the mess, the Coca-Cola file hit his
desk.
</P>
<P>
   On June 8, a dozen students at a Catholic school in the
prosperous town of Bornem were taken to a local hospital
complaining of vomiting, nausea and headaches after drinking small
bottles of Coca-Cola during their late morning break.
</P>
<P>
   During the day another 21 kids trickled in; and overnight six
arrived at the hospital. Fifteen of the 39 were admitted.
</P>
<P>
   A Belgian Coca-Cola executive came to the school in the
afternoon after getting a call from its headmaster. Samples were
gathered and dispatched to labs in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The next day the company faxed a letter to the school
acknowledging that the illnesses may have had something to do with
its products.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, eight students at a school in Brugge, a favorite
tourist destination, reported getting sick after drinking Coke
products. This incident prompted Van den Bossche to pay closer
attention.
</P>
<P>
   A week later, 30 students of about the same age in the town of
Lochristi 20 miles away from Bornem reported similar symptoms after
drinking cans of Cokes and Coke products from a vending machine.
They were transported by ambulance to Ghent, the largest city in
the region.
</P>
<P>
   Images of retching children being rushed to hospitals were
featured on the evening news.
</P>
<P>
   Similar reports began to flood the government -- 112 students
from five schools reported they were getting sick after drinking
Coke products.
</P>
<P>
   In Van den Bossche's office, it was becoming obvious that the
Belgian government had a potential new crisis on its hands. ``I'm
eating dioxin and drinking Coca-Cola,'' said one bureaucrat as the
new crisis joined the old one.
</P>
<P>
   Coke began withdrawing some of its products, but the reports of
illnesses persisted. In all, 249 people sought medical attention in
Belgium for symptoms they associated with drinking Coke products.
</P>
<P>
   In the first week, government officials complained that Coke was
neither sensitive to the government's position nor forthcoming with
explanations.
</P>
<P>
   On June 14, a clearly exasperated Van den Bossche surprised
everyone by banning the sale of all Coca-Cola products until
someone could tell him out why all these people were getting sick.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, he was telling aides that the soft drink company
deserved what it was getting for not being more open and failing to
understand the sensitivity of public sentiments about food safety.
</P>
<P>
   Van den Bossche also found it irritating and arrogant that Coke
would not divulge its secret formula, which raised suspicions that
something may have gone awry with the syrup.
</P>
<P>
   Very early on, an advisory panel of doctors advised him that the
Coca-Cola crisis could be explained as a mass psychosomatic
reaction -- now the broadly accepted explanation -- but he was
unwilling to risk the wrath of Belgian parents by telling them that
it was all in their children's heads.
</P>
<P>
   He also expressed concern about appearing soft on the American
corporate giant. ``Coca Cola is a big company, it's a symbol, it's
the United States,'' said Michel de Muelenaere, the home news
editor for the national daily Le Soir.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, it soon became clear that government scientists, who tested
the beverages for 15,000 toxins, could find nothing to warrant a
continued ban. Coca-Cola provided its own explanation that the
bottles had become contaminated with sulfur-laced carbon dioxide
gas and the cans had come in contact with a fungicide on wooden
pallets. Neither substance was found in high enough levels to
explain the symptoms, adding credence for the psychosomatic theory.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, to the vexation of Coke executives assembled in a war room
at the company's suburban Brussels plant, Van den Bossche agreed
only to ease but not lift the restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the minister feared to lose face,'' said Benoit
Nemery, a toxicologist and a member of the government's advisory
team of doctors. ``After being so radical, it would have been very
difficult for him to say, 'Sorry, that wasn't really necessary.'''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, as the air of suspicion continued in Belgium other
countries either joined in restricting Coke products -- as in the
case of France -- or took pains to reassure their citizens that
Coke products sold in their countries were safe.
</P>
<P>
   Within days, Coke had a full-scale crisis on its hands.
</P>
<P>
   While executives in Belgium seemed to understand the perilous
environment in Europe, the situation seemed to be grasped slowly by
Coca-Cola executives in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Two days after the ban was enacted, Coke finally responded in a
big public way with chairman Douglas Ivester issuing an apologetic
statement. Two days after that, Ivester arrived in Brussels to
focus his personal attention on the crisis -- 10 days after it
began.
</P>
<P>
   Philippe Lenfant, a Belgian Coca-Cola executive, said the
company perhaps reacted too slowly. ``I admit we perhaps lost
control of the situation to a certain extent,'' Lenfant said during
a television interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a crisis-management strategy,'' Lenfant said. ``But
the crisis was bigger than any worst-case scenario we could have
imagined. The first couple of days of the crisis we didn't know
(the cause), and I humbly admit that we should have said so more
clearly.''
</P>
<P>
   The ban was lifted June 23, even though Van den Bossche lamented
that no one had yet given him sufficient explanation as to why so
many people fell ill.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Atlantans could be forgiven for failing to master
the mind-numbing nuances of Belgian politics -- one frustrated Coke
executive observed: ``You don't have to have banana trees to have a
banana republic.'' -- or comprehend that the concern over food
already bordered on hysteria.
</P>
<P>
   The dioxin scare is only the most recent in a series of such
crises involving European governments and failures either to
adequately inform the public of a risk or to color the truth enough
to lose all credibility. After the mad-cow disease scare in
Britain, occasional bouts of e-coli, fears over hormone-laced beef
from the United States and even aspersions of beef blood
derivatives used in French wine, consumers don't know what to
believe.
</P>
<P>
   In Britain, consumers for months have had to eat breakfast
contending with newspaper reports on the creeping threat of
Genetically Modified food -- called ``Frankenstein Food'' by
tabloid headline writers.
</P>
<P>
   The public rejection of such foods has been intense -- even
though they are common in the United States and have not been shown
to pose any health threats. Two major European food producers
decided to capitalize on the concern. Nestle and Unilever are
introducing lines of ``GM-free'' foods, while other companies have
decided to pull their products containing these genetically
modified foods from store shelves.
</P>
<P>
   All this has created an atmosphere both complex and hostile for
companies such as Coca-Cola, to whom image is everything.
</P>
<P>
   Had this all occurred before that farmer observed the problems
with his eggs and chicks, Coke's problems would have been greatly
reduced, said Muelenaere, the Le Soir editor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been something because it is Coca-Cola,'' said
De Muelenaere, whose newspaper featured Coke stories side-by-side
the dioxin stories for a week last month. ``But you would not have
seen the government behave as aggressively as it did or the media
causing so much -- I don't want to use the word 'hysteria' --
interest.''

   ``It would have been something because it is Coca-Cola,'' said
De Muelenaere, whose newspaper featured Coke stories side-by-side
the dioxin stories for a week last month. ``But you would not have
seen the government behave as aggressively as it did or the media
causing so much -- I don't want to use the word 'hysteria' --
interest.''

TAKING PORTABLES INTO NEW TERRITORY &HT;    (For release July 9, 1999) &HT;    By DWIGHT SILVERMAN
 &HT;    c.1999 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   (UNDATED) In my never-ending search for the perfect portable
computer, I am torn between two types.
</P>
<P>
   I openly lust for the big-screen, high performance,
top-of-the-line behemoths favored by those who must do slick
presentations on the road. However, my passion dies quickly when I
try to use one of these on an airplane, or when I am trudging
across a trade show floor, building muscles as I go.
</P>
<P>
   Then, I long for the light, thin models that come with smaller
screens but are still full-featured. I enjoy using one until I have
to type a lengthy story on the tiny keyboard _ and must finish it
before the anemic battery dies.
</P>
<P>
   Here are two notebook computers that perfectly illustrate the
agony and the ecstasy at both ends of the size spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   Portg 3020CT _ $1,899, Toshiba. &UR;  &LR; The Portg 3020CT is a
frustrating small notebook. It's an excellent example of what great
thin-and-light systems can be _ and an example of the classic
mistakes too often made by their designers.
</P>
<P>
   This portable virtually defines the thin-and-light category.
It's just under 3 pounds and only three-fourths of an inch thick.
It has a 10.4-inch active matrix screen, a 300-megahertz mobile
Pentium MMX chip, 32 megabytes of memory, a 6.4-gigabyte hard drive
and the touch-point, eraserhead-style pointing device.
</P>
<P>
   Many thin-and-light ultraportables come with only a few ports
built in, relying on an external port replicator to handle the
rest. The 3020CT actually has a decent number of built-in ports,
including two Type II PC-card slots, one on each side of the base.
There are infrared and USB ports, a connection for the included
external floppy drive and headphone and microphone jacks.
Traditional serial and parallel ports, as well as a connection for
a monitor, come on an external module.
</P>
<P>
   The modem is not built-in, but Toshiba includes a PC-card-based
56K modem made by 3Com.
</P>
<P>
   This computer is excellent for road work. If you need to access
the corporate network, log on to the Internet, work with e-mail and
even give a presentation, it's wonderfully useful. It certainly
won't weigh down your shoulders as you dash through airports.
</P>
<P>
   But the very thing that makes it attractive also makes it
difficult to use, and that's its small size.
</P>
<P>
   I found typing on the keyboard for any length of time quite
irritating. One of the main problems is the positioning of the
cursor keys in a design that's common to too many small notebooks.
The up-arrow key is positioned next to the undersized right-shift
key. When I went to hit that shift key, I too often hit the
up-arrow key, sending my cursor into the line of text above.
</P>
<P>
   The small size also means the 3020CT must have a small battery,
which has a short life. The best I could do was just over two
hours. While the system is peppy when plugged in, running the
3020CT in battery mode made it relatively sluggish.
</P>
<P>
   The screen is relatively bright, but again, when powered down to
save battery life it became hard to see under bright-light
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the Portg 3020CT does not come with a CD-ROM drive.
You'll have to purchase that separate for about $250, or connect to
a network to install new software.
</P>
<P>
   Presario 1825 _ $3,549, Compaq Computer Corp. &UR;  &LR; At the other end
of the scale is the Presario 1825, a monster of a notebook computer
that can effectively replace a desktop PC. Aimed at home and
home-office users, it's big on glitzy, state-of-the-art features _
and just plain big!
</P>
<P>
   The 1825's biggest feature is its display. At 15 inches, it's
the largest you can buy on a portable system, and about the
equivalent of the viewable area on older 17-inch monitors. The
active-matrix screen is bright and crisp, and is the best 15-inch
portable display I've seen yet.
</P>
<P>
   The model I tried comes with a 400-megahertz Pentium II chip,
192 megabytes of memory, a 10-gigabyte hard drive, a 4X DVD-ROM
drive, combination floppy/LS-120 (120-megabyte) drive, a built-in
Ethernet connection, a 56K modem and a port for connecting this
computer to a standard TV.
</P>
<P>
   That latter feature is being found on more and more notebook
computers that come with DVD. This essentially turns your portable
PC into a DVD movie player that can be connected to a home
entertainment system. Now, if only some smart manufacturer would
add a remote control that works with the DVD software on the
computer...
</P>
<P>
   It comes with a spacious keyboard (the cursor keys are placed
below the right-shift key, out of the way) and a responsive
touchpad pointing device. Oversized mouse buttons make it easy to
point-and-click.
</P>
<P>
   As I mentioned, the display is gorgeous. It's also relatively
fast, using an ATI Rage Pro graphics adapter, the same type found
in many consumer desktop systems. It has excellent sound to go with
its great visuals, and has a feature that lets you play music CDs
while the PC is off.
</P>
<P>
   But there should be no illusions about the size and weight of
this system. While it's not quite as heavy as Dell's monstrous
Latitude 7000, it still weighs in at a hefty 8 pounds. It's also
thinner than the Dell, at about 1.6 inches thick. Still, it's so
large, I had to struggle to make it fit the notebook case I
regularly use.
</P>
<P>
   It comes with a huge battery, but with a 400-megahertz Pentium
II chip and the 15-inch screen draining it quickly, it doesn't have
much staying power. I got a little over two hours on it.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, this machine will be sold on Compaq's Web site,
as well as at retail. It is likely to dwarf anything else on the
shelf.

HOW TO REMOVE SOME ICONS CLUTTERING UP WINDOWS 98 DESKTOP &HT;    (For release July 9, 1999) &HT;    By DWIGHT SILVERMAN
 &HT;    c.1999 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   (UNDATED) Q. By When I first upgraded to Windows 98, I wanted to
have icons for the things I use all the time on my desktop. Since
then, though, things have gotten very cluttered. I want to move
some of these icons back into the folders on the Start menu. How do
I do that?
</P>
<P>
   A. One of the interesting things about the way Windows 95/98 is
designed is that almost everything on the system has to do with
folders. For example, the desktop itself is actually a folder. If
you go into My Computer and find your Windows folder on your main
hard drive, you'll find inside it a subfolder called Desktop. Click
on that, and you'll see all the icons on your Desktop.
</P>
<P>
   The Start menu is also a subfolder found in the Windows folder _
it's called, appropriately enough, Start Menu. From here you can
also get to the Programs folder, and all the program groups that it
holds.
</P>
<P>
   There's a nifty trick you can use to get there quickly, rather
than going through My Computer. Right-click on the Start menu, and
choose Explore from the menu that appears. Now you'll have a
two-pane window that shows the contents of the Start menu on the
right, and a tree-based view of the folder structure on the left.
</P>
<P>
   Use either side to get to the folder that originally held the
icon now on your desktop. Then, just drag the icon into that folder
and drop it there. If you use the right mouse button to do this,
you'll have a choice of moving, copying or creating a shortcut.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Is it possible to check and read my e-mail from someone
else's computer?
</P>
<P>
   A. If your Internet service provider uses a standard form of
e-mail known as POP3 (for Post Office Protocol), then there are
several services that will let you access your e-mail from any Web
browser.
</P>
<P>
   The one I like to use is MailStart at www.mailstart.com. This
lets you do almost anything a basic e-mail program will do,
including delete messages in batches. It runs a bit slowly _ the
speed also can vary depending on your provider's mail server _ but
works well.
</P>
<P>
   Another is ReadMail at www.readmail.com. It's a little faster,
but does not have as many capabilities as MailStart. (It also
offers a daily national weather map to study while you wait for
your mail!)
</P>
<P>
   Both services require that you put your e-mail password into
their system so it can be passed on to your provider's mail server.
This is a necessity if you want to use them.
</P>
<P>
   Note that these will not work with America Online's mail system,
which does not use POP3. America Online has its own Web-based
e-mail at netmail.web.aol.com.
</P>
<P>
   Some other major Internet providers have their own Web e-mail
service. Check with your provider before hitting the road.
</P>
<P>
   Q. I got a new joystick that will work with either a Universal
Serial Bus or a joystick port. I've tried it in both, and really
can't tell the difference. Which is better to use?
</P>
<P>
   A. Use the USB port. It transfers information between the
computer and the joystick much faster than through the gameport.
</P>
<P>
   If you didn't notice the difference, chances are the game you
were playing was not that demanding. You might not notice it with,
say, Microsoft Flight Simulator. But you'd definitely see the
difference playing a jet combat simulator such as Falcon 4.0.
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am looking for a good Web site that lists new drivers and
patches for the Macintosh. You run some Mac items in Update. Where
do you get them?
</P>
<P>
   A. Try MacFixIt, at www.macfixit.com, which is an excellent site
devoted to troubleshooting and maintaining Macintosh computers. It
not only has driver and patch info, but also includes articles on
issues involving Mac hardware and software.
</P>
<P>
   Got a question about your computer? Maybe Computing columnist
Dwight Silverman can help. Send e-mail to
dwight.silverman(a)chron.com, or call 713-220-2000 and enter access
code 1001.

`MOVIE STARS' DOESN'T SHINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
MOVIE STARS 
Starring: Harry Hamlin, Jennifer Grant, Mark Benninghofen, Marnette
Patterson, Zack Hopkins, Rachel David, Anne Haney 
On: The WB 
Time: Sunday and Monday, 9-9:30 p.m. 
Rated: TVPG 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's a good time for a mainstream sitcom that trades on insider
knowledge of Hollywood. Because we're all insiders these days, and
ready and willing to get one-liners about Tina Turner's wigs and
Sean Penn's temper and Mel Gibson's many, many children. And we've
all learned not to take Hollywood at face value, to cultivate a
healthy sense of humor about actors and their plastic surgery and
their big bright green publicity machines.
</P>
<P>
   But it's never a good time for a grating sitcom like ``Movie
Stars,'' which squanders its potential on unbelievably stale
entertainment jokes that feel like they've been plucked from last
year's Jay Leno monologues. Someone should tell the writers of this
new WB series that goofs on Kevin Costner's political correctness
and Calista Flockhart's weight issues are very over, to say the
least. They do not constitute sharp Hollywood satire. While
comedies like HBO's ``The Larry Sanders Show'' and ABC's ``It's
like, you know . . .'' have managed to take an original point of
view on the cotton candy that is Lalaland, ``Movie Stars'' is about
as fresh and timely as a crinkled old People magazine in a doctor's
waiting room.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not only the lazy entertainment gags that make ``Movie
Stars'' so banal. All the tired references to Dweezil Zappa and
Roseanne and Robin Williams are put in the mouths of a family of
family-sitcom stereotypes who make for very annoying company
indeed. Mom and Dad are major stars: Jacey's an Oscar-nominated
actress and critical fave, while Reese is an action hero who makes
dumb blockbusters about giant insects. But they are meant to be
seen as just plain old ordinary TV parents, who must deal with all
the expected blended-family sitcom issues. The source of most of
their parental angst is Reese's rebellious daughter from a previous
marriage, 16-year-old Lori, who of course doesn't like her stepmom
very much. Meanwhile, Reese and Jacey's kids, ages 13 and 6, do
their precocious-Hollywood-kids bit on the sidelines. Even if the
jokes had vitality, this family would still be deadly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Movie Stars,'' which premieres Sunday at 9 p.m. on Ch. 56,
tries to be clever by giving Reese a demoralized, wannabe brother
named Todd, who works as Reese's assistant. Todd attends a weekly
poker game with other famous brothers _ Joey Travolta, Don Swayze,
Frank Stallone _ each of whom appears as himself. We're supposed to
laugh as the four sit around commiserating on the struggles of
living in the shadows of famous men, but their scenes have an
awkward, desperate undercurrent. Like Swayze, Travolta, and
Stallone, Jennifer Grey plays herself on ``It's like, you know . .
. ,'' but the pathos of her self-ridicule is tempered by the fact
that she is well known for her own work, and not that of her
sibling. She doesn't seem quite as downtrodden.
</P>
<P>
   The lead actors are all fine, but not quite natural in the
show's milieu. As Reese and Jacey, Harry Hamlin and Jennifer Grant
behave too much like ordinary Middle Americans to be rich and
famous and living in a gorgeous Malibu beach house. A few more
affectations and a bit more ego might be in order _ and might
provide a few laughs. ``Movie Stars,'' which will air on Sundays
and Mondays at 9 through the summer, fails to offer refreshment
amid the desert of network reruns.

THE NEW WYNONNA: SINGLE, WORKING MOM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Wynonna is back on the road with what she proudly calls ``The
Working Mama Tour.'' It's a blend of the musical and the domestic _
and it's working out just fine, thank you, the singer says during a
brief stop at her Nashville home.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is, I'm a mama by day and a red-headed singer by
night. I'm living the best of both worlds,'' she says. ``It's kind
of like we're on a family vacation and, `Oh, by the way, mama has a
show tonight.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly Wynonna's mother, Naomi Judd, jumps on the line to
describe her daughter as ``Xena with an electric guitar.'' That's
an apt phrase, because these days Wynonna is having fun and kicking
butt at the same time with her adrenalized mix of
rhythm-and-blues-spiced country and rock.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm 35 _ and I feel like I'm moving on to the next part of my
life. . . . I believe all things are possible right now,'' says
Wynonna, alias ``Hurricane Wynonna,'' who swoops into the South
Shore Music Circus in Cohasset on Wednesday and the North Shore
Music Theatre in Beverly on July 19.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a working single parent raising two children _ and mama
wants to work,'' says Wynonna, who has two children, Elijah, 5, and
Grace, 3, by Arch Kelly 3d, whom she recently divorced.
</P>
<P>
   While on the topic of all things being possible, she says she's
making a new album with the help of the Tower of Power horn section
and is about to call Joni Mitchell to ask her to sing backup on a
cover of Mitchell's ``Help Me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She's one of my heroes,'' Wynonna says of Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   In big news for country fans, Wynonna also will join Naomi to
resurrect the Judds _ the mother-and-daughter duo that ruled the
country airwaves during the '80s. They're planning a one-time-only
New Year's Eve show in Phoenix, though speculation is rife that
more dates may lie ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not planning anything beyond this show,'' says Wynonna,
countering the rumors. ``And I really want to do it right. It's
like planning a wedding.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're also very clear that this will celebrate her healing,''
adds Wynonna, referring to how Naomi, who quit the road in 1991
because of Hepatitis C, has since conquered the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Naomi, who has had a TV show, a radio show, and written an
autobiography and a children's book in the intervening years, jumps
on the phone again to mention how excited, but also how nervous,
she is to rejoin her daughter for the concert. But when Wynonna
exclaims that ``Mom, I want my own bus!,'' Naomi fires back, ``I
want my own bus because yours looks like a day-care center!''
</P>
<P>
   Wynonna went solo in 1992 with the album ``Wynonna,'' which sold
5 million copies to become the top-selling female country album
ever at that point. The record has since been broken by LeAnn Rimes
and Shania Twain, but Wynonna is not fazed.
</P>
<P>
   ``To thine own self be true,'' she says. ``I want to be true to
myself and what I believe. I don't have to worry about being No. 1
anymore. What I have to do is just keep singing my butt off.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``new'' Wynonna is also very accepting of her legacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tammy Wynette paved the road for me _ and I paved it for LeAnn
and Shania. They're the next generation,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   As for the widespread success of women in country music, Wynonna
adds, ``God's timing is always right on time. And my philosophy is
that a rising tide lifts all boats. . . . It's a really good time
for women, and if I can jump in line, I'm ready.''
</P>
<P>
   And, while some artists have taken chippy potshots at Shania's
success, Wynonna says, ``I like her,'' though she admits that
``women either love or hate her, and men covet her success.''
</P>
<P>
   Wynonna is not about to envy anyone, because as she gets older,
she feels more empowered about her own abilities. She just
finished, for example, a confidence-boosting, six-day, 60-mile hike
at the Ashram, a spiritual center, in Calabassus, Calif. (where
Oprah Winfrey has been) and was pleased to lose 13 pounds in the
process.
</P>
<P>
   ``It changed my perspective on life,'' says Wynonna, who
attended at the suggestion of her sister, actress Ashley Judd. ``I
would get halfway through the hike each day and start crying. I was
the last one on the hike every day, but I still did it.''
</P>
<P>
   Wynonna says she's also learned to be alone _ another vital step
on what she perceives as her ongoing spiritual journey.
</P>
<P>
   ``People think I'm a hurricane blast, but I'm also realizing how
introverted I am,'' says Wynonna. ``I'm just learning more and more
about myself. And I feel sorry for the next guy who comes along,
because I'll be so aware!''
</P>
<P>
   Spoken like a true working mama.

GOP IN SENATE HAS HIJACKED US FOREIGN POLICY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, July 11, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most of us, in our heart or hearts, would do whatever we had to
do to feed our children. Cheat. Steal. Sell whatever we had to
sell. Take by force. And worse.
</P>
<P>
   The human instinct for survival, the selfish gene, would
override most societal norms of behavior. And if that is true for
us and ours, why don't we admit that the poor people around the
planet might feel the same way? Do the rich love their children
more than the poor? No way.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why America's official policy toward the rest of the
world, and the institutions that try to represent mankind as a
whole, such as the United Nations, is self-defeating. The nativist
strain of the Republican party, typified by the Helms-Buchanan
element, have hijacked American foreign policy thanks to the GOP's
narrow control of the US Senate.
</P>
<P>
   That outdated institution, a stodgy circus ring of blowhards and
troglodytes, refuses to pay UN back dues of a billion dollars,
throttles birth control and abortion programs that are desperately
needed to curb the population explosion, and blocks appointment of
able and progressive diplomats.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Weld, the Republican Clinton wanted to represent us in
Mexico? Shot down by Sen. Jesse Helms over some petty political
beef. Brian Atwood, the departing Agency for International
Development chief, nominated to be US ambassador to Brazil? Shot
down by Helms. Richard Holbrooke, the American diplomat with most
experience in the Balkans, Clinton's choice for UN ambassador?
Holbrooke was held up for months by Helms, depriving the US of the
active involvement of the man who knows Milosevic best. Now four
different GOP senators block Holbrooke's confirmation, as they try
to extort unrelated concessions from the White House.
</P>
<P>
   So the Republicans beggar the UN, even as the planet is roiled
by conflicts the UN was designed to ameliorate. They slice our
measly foreign aid allotment every year, the classic case of the
rich telling the poor to eat cake, heh heh. They withold family
planning advice, money and contraceptives in a straight payoff to
the lobbyists of the religious right.
</P>
<P>
   None of this is good for the longterm security of the American
people.
</P>
<P>
   Atwood warned that the poor around the world think us arrogant
and uncaring. We kindle resentment and envy in the undeveloped
world, and our children may reap the consequences, he said.
</P>
<P>
   About two billion of the world's people live on the equivalent
of $2 or less per day. As television spreads pictures of the rich
nations' life of ease and comfort, the great unwashed become
envious, then resentful, and ultimately determined to taste the
riches for themselves. Think of some landless peasant somewhere,
formulating the equivalent of ``When in the course of human events
it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands
which have connected them with another . . .''
</P>
<P>
   To the extent they view us as part of the problem, and not part
of the solution, we are at risk. Terrorism, uprising, expropriation
are their options. But the US Congress blunders blissfully onward:
the hell with the world's poor.
</P>
<P>
   One of the great unspoken rationales for a free-trading foreign
policy, Nafta, GATT and the like, is that by creating jobs and
markets in underdeveloped lands, we keep their workers there, and
lighten our immigrant load. Undoubtedly, Nafta costs us some
low-wage jobs in this country. But the tradeoff in the global
econmy is worth that price.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and former Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin were right
when they insisted on the Mexican loan bailout. When your
neighbor's house is on fire, you can either help him douse the
blaze, or wait for him to move in with you. After Hurricane Mitch
devastated some Latin American towns, US aid was proposed to keep
those Honduran and Dominican peasants working at home, rather than
trekking illegally into the US.
</P>
<P>
   Building up the subsistence economies of the Third World anchors
those populations, creates markets for US goods, and jobs here.
That is why congressional opposition to allowing China into the
World Trade Organization is self-defeating. That colossus,
one-quarter of the world's 6 billion people, met most of our
requirements. But Clinton was forced to slam the door because the
Republicans were off on the Chinese missile technology spying
caper.
</P>
<P>
   Linking that with Clinton fund-raising stink, and the Johnny
Chung case, the GOP decided to play politics. When the French,
Germans, Japanese and others leapfrog us into the world's single
largest potential market, a lot of these oafs may be out of office,
but the damage they've wrought will live on. When our embassies are
blown up, our airliners bombed down, our tourists and businessmen
kidnapped, our retaliation will be swift and nasty, once blame can
be assigned and the pepretrators identified. But we are stoking the
very fires that will singe us, by refusing to play the role of the
accommodating rich relative.
</P>
<P>
   There is never any shortage of politicians and critics who sneer
that, `Hey, we've got a lot of problems closer to home that need
money tossed in their direction.' True enough. But like a forest
parched by summer-long drought, the tempers of the Third World
approach the flash-point.
</P>
<P>
   There is plenty of support for an open hand, from the Pope on
down to the hippest Hollywood celebrity. But the GOP lock on the
Congress prevents any but the most parsimonious of aid, and
least-controversial appointments.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton White House always has a dozen foreign-policy balls
in the air at any given time. We are trying to broker the
India-Pakistan pseudo-war, the North Korean meltdown, the Northern
Ireland peace talks collapse, the Kosovo outcome, and a half-dozen
more disputes. It would all be so much easier if the isolationists
were not in control of the US Senate.

   CHARLOTTE AMALIE, U.S. Virgin Islands _ Imagine it's the late
1600s.
</P>
<P>
   The island of St. Thomas is populated by runaway slaves,
shipwrecked sailors, and soldiers who spend much of their time in a
fog from drinking a witches' brew called Kill Devil Rum.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of this patchwork of personalities is a smattering
of European Jews seeking to eke out a living as shopkeepers and
small landowners after fleeing the Spanish Inquisition.
</P>
<P>
   The Jews of St. Thomas flourish, bolstered by other Jews from
Brazil and Portugal also seeking refuge from persecution.
</P>
<P>
   By 1796, they raise an astounding $3,476 to build their first
synagogue, a Spanish Moorish structure that is eventually replaced
by something more spacious. But that synagogue -- and then another
-- are destroyed by fire.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in 1833, the Jews build the ``Holy Congregation of
Blessing and Peace and Loving Deeds.''
</P>
<P>
   It's this synagogue that still stands, appropriately atop the
steep Synagogue Hill, as a testament to the Caribbean's stature as
a tolerant haven for Jews.
</P>
<P>
   But the synagogue, like the congregation it supports, has
suffered with age.
</P>
<P>
   The number of families that belong to the Hebrew congregation
has fallen from 200 in 1993 to about 120 today. Young people have
gone away to college in the United States and never come back;
other people have fled St. Thomas since Hurricane Marilyn
devastated much of the island in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   This week, though, a massive project to restore the synagogue's
original beauty got underway, a restoration that's part of an
ongoing effort by Jewish families here to preserve their heritage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want the synagogue to look the way it used to . . . we want
to restore the synagogue's original integrity,'' said architect
Bill Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   The $350,000 makeover is expected to be completed by December.
</P>
<P>
   The structure is the oldest synagogue under the American flag to
have never missed Sabbath services. It is the third-oldest
synagogue in the Western Hemisphere after a temple built in 1732 on
the Dutch Caribbean island of Curacao and a 1763 synagogue in
Newport, R.I.
</P>
<P>
   The congregation also boasts that its synagogue held the first
confirmation ceremony for Jewish youth in the Western Hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   The historical significance of the building, with its arched
window frames and original mahogany pews, has smitten visitors for
decades.
</P>
<P>
   The menorah behind the bima, or pulpit, is of Spanish origin and
dates from the 11th century. And the ark contains six Torah
scrolls, three of them Sephardic, the others Ashkenazic. Two of
them are more than 200 years old.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a Czech memorial scroll, one of the few to survive
the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   All are part of a Jewish legacy little-known to many Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Historians believe that Jews first settled on St. Thomas as
early as 1665, with many reaching the Caribbean -- including such
islands as Curacao -- via Holland, which had opened its doors to
Jews after winning its 80-year battle with Spain.
</P>
<P>
   Holland urged the Jews to settle in the deserted West Indian
islands Holland hoped to control. Those who did soon found work as
shop owners or participants in the region's rum, sugar, and
molasses businesses.
</P>
<P>
   A real influx of Jews to St. Thomas occurred in the 1780s, when
Jews on the Dutch island of St. Eustatius fled here after the
British attacked that island in reprisal for the islanders' aid to
the American forces during the Revolutionary War.
</P>
<P>
   The painter Camille Pissarro was born on St. Thomas in 1830 and
worshipped at the synagogue with his parents before moving to
Europe where he became a leader in the Impressionist movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The history of Jews in North America begins in the Caribbean,
although not a lot of people know about this,'' said Leon
Weissberg, executive director of the Jewish Education Commission, a
division of the Jewish Federation of South Palm Beach County in
Delray Beach, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   He said Jews from the Caribbean first reached Florida in the
1700s, settling both in Key West and Pensacola in Florida's
Panhandle.
</P>
<P>
   ``At one time, Pensacola's was the largest Jewish community in
the South outside of Savannah (Ga.),'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Weissberg added that the renovation of the synagogue on St.
Thomas is vital to preserving an important testament to the faith
of the early Jewish settlers.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly time -- as well as a string of hurricanes -- have
taken their toll on the synagogue.
</P>
<P>
   It stands in the heart of Charlotte Amalie, known for its narrow
winding streets and the European ambiance of its colonial
buildings. Just a short walk away is a Jewish cemetery, which
includes tombstones dating from 1792.
</P>
<P>
   In 1972, the building's walls were stripped of their crumbling
plaster, leaving worshippers to gather within exposed brick and
stone walls. Over the years, salt trapped under layers of sealant
have begun corroding these walls, which were constructed from local
rock and European brick that ships brought to the island as
ballast.
</P>
<P>
   The cement that holds the bricks together is a mortar made from
sand, limestone, and molasses. It is said that, in earlier years,
children used to lick the walls of the synagogue to taste the sweet
molasses.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the renovation, the walls will -- again -- be covered
in plaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``The exposed brick just didn't work too well,'' said office
manager Roy McMaster. ``Now the walls will be entirely white
again.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the walls, the restoration also will include:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The cleaning of four pillars, handmade in Denmark from rounded
bricks, that support the entrance;
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  restoration of European chandeliers, a few of which are still
lit by candles on special holidays;
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  and replacing of the synagogue's ark, constructed with plaster
and a finish of faux wood and marble, with one fashioned from real
marble and real mahogany.
</P>
<P>
   But the structure's sand-covered floor, perhaps its
most-striking feature, will not be touched.
</P>
<P>
   The floor's meaning can be traced to the Sephardic Jews of
Spain. Those Jews had been given a horrific choice: either convert
to Catholicism or face a torturous death at the hands of the
Inquisition. Those who chose to stay -- and stay Jewish -- used
sand on the floor to muffle the sounds of their movements during
prayer so as not to be discovered.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea is to pay tribute to those who came before,''
McMaster said. ``We don't want to do anything that would change
that.''
</P>
<P>
   For your information: To contribute money to the restoration
project, send checks to the Hebrew Congregation, P.O. Box 266, St.
Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands, 00804.

a tolerant haven for Jews.
</P>
<P>
   But the synagogue, like the congregation it supports, has
suffered with age.
</P>
<P>
   The number of families that belong to the Hebrew congregation
has fallen from 200 in 1993 to about 120 today. Young people have
gone away to college in the United States and never come back;
other people have fled St. Thomas since Hurricane Marilyn
devastated much of the island in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   This week, though, a massive project to restore the synagogue's
original beauty got underway, a restoration that's part of an
ongoing effort by Jewish families here to preserve their heritage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want the synagogue to look the way it used to . . . we want
to restore the synagogue's original integrity,'' said architect
Bill Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   The $350,000 makeover is expected to be completed by December.
</P>
<P>
   The structure is the oldest synagogue under the American flag to
have never missed Sabbath services. It is the third-oldest
synagogue in the Western Hemisphere after a temple built in 1732 on
the Dutch Caribbean island of Curacao and a 1763 synagogue in
Newport, R.I.
</P>
<P>
   The congregation also boasts that its synagogue held the first
confirmation ceremony for Jewish youth in the Western Hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   The historical significance of the building, with its arched
window frames and original mahogany pews, has smitten visitors for
decades.
</P>
<P>
   The menorah behind the bima, or pulpit, is of Spanish origin and
dates from the 11th century. And the ark contains six Torah
scrolls, three of them Sephardic, the others Ashkenazic. Two of
them are more than 200 years old.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a Czech memorial scroll, one of the few to survive
the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   All are part of a Jewish legacy little-known to many Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Historians believe that Jews first settled on St. Thomas as
early as 1665, with many reaching the Caribbean -- including such
islands as Curacao -- via Holland, which had opened its doors to
Jews after winning its 80-year battle with Spain.
</P>
<P>
   Holland urged the Jews to settle in the deserted West Indian
islands Holland hoped to control. Those who did soon found work as
shop owners or participants in the region's rum, sugar, and
molasses businesses.
</P>
<P>
   A real influx of Jews to St. Thomas occurred in the 1780s, when
Jews on the Dutch island of St. Eustatius fled here after the
British attacked that island in reprisal for the islanders' aid to
the American forces during the Revolutionary War.
</P>
<P>
   The painter Camille Pissarro was born on St. Thomas in 1830 and
worshipped at the synagogue with his parents before moving to
Europe where he became a leader in the Impressionist movement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The history of Jews in North America begins in the Caribbean,
although not a lot of people know about this,'' said Leon
Weissberg, executive director of the Jewish Education Commission, a
division of the Jewish Federation of South Palm Beach County in
Delray Beach, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   He said Jews from the Caribbean first reached Florida in the
1700s, settling both in Key West and Pensacola in Florida's
Panhandle.
</P>
<P>
   ``At one time, Pensacola's was the largest Jewish community in
the South outside of Savannah (Ga.),'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Weissberg added that the renovation of the synagogue on St.
Thomas is vital to preserving an important testament to the faith
of the early Jewish settlers.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly time -- as well as a string of hurricanes -- have
taken their toll on the synagogue.
</P>
<P>
   It stands in the heart of Charlotte Amalie, known for its narrow
winding streets and the European ambiance of its colonial
buildings. Just a short walk away is a Jewish cemetery, which
includes tombstones dating from 1792.
</P>
<P>
   In 1972, the building's walls were stripped of their crumbling
plaster, leaving worshippers to gather within exposed brick and
stone walls. Over the years, salt trapped under layers of sealant
have begun corroding these walls, which were constructed from local
rock and European brick that ships brought to the island as
ballast.
</P>
<P>
   The cement that holds the bricks together is a mortar made from
sand, limestone, and molasses. It is said that, in earlier years,
children used to lick the walls of the synagogue to taste the sweet
molasses.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the renovation, the walls will -- again -- be covered
in plaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``The exposed brick just didn't work too well,'' said office
manager Roy McMaster. ``Now the walls will be entirely white
again.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the walls, the restoration also will include:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The cleaning of four pillars, handmade in Denmark from rounded
bricks, that support the entrance;
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  restoration of European chandeliers, a few of which are still
lit by candles on special holidays;
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  and replacing of the synagogue's ark, constructed with plaster
and a finish of faux wood and marble, with one fashioned from real
marble and real mahogany.
</P>
<P>
   But the structure's sand-covered floor, perhaps its
most-striking feature, will not be touched.
</P>
<P>
   The floor's meaning can be traced to the Sephardic Jews of
Spain. Those Jews had been given a horrific choice: either convert
to Catholicism or face a torturous death at the hands of the
Inquisition. Those who chose to stay -- and stay Jewish -- used
sand on the floor to muffle the sounds of their movements during
prayer so as not to be discovered.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea is to pay tribute to those who came before,''
McMaster said. ``We don't want to do anything that would change
that.''
</P>
<P>
   For your information: To contribute money to the restoration
project, send checks to the Hebrew Congregation, P.O. Box 266, St.
Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands, 00804.

IT'S GNAWING AT YOUR FUND, AND NOW IT HAS A NAME 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDITORS: Originally skedded as MUTFUND-IMPACT-COSTS) 
(For release Sun., July 11) 
(jt) 
 By CAROLE GOULD    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Something is eating into mutual fund returns. It is called
market impact cost _ in essence, the impact that buy or sell orders
can have on stock prices. And Barra Inc., a research and consulting
firm in Berkeley, Calif., has developed a program to let investors
see how much those costs are affecting a portfolio's performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like expense ratios, market impact creates a cost that funds
have to overcome before they can add any value,'' said Nicolo
Torre, Barra's managing director for research. ``The lower the
hurdle, the more likely that they will be able to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Barra, which began selling market impact data to institutional
investors about a year ago, has picked up two mutual fund clients,
American Century and Fidelity Investments, that are known to pay
plenty of attention to such costs. Barra has talked to Morningstar
Inc., the Chicago financial publisher, about including market
impact data in its fund ratings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barra has taken on a large and important issue that until now
people had simply thrown up their hands at,'' said John
Rekenthaler, research director for Morningstar, which is weighing
whether to include the data along with the annual expenses and
sales loads that it reports for funds.
</P>
<P>
   Market impact flows from the idea that stock prices are based on
supply and demand. The more shares available for sale at a given
time, the lower the price buyers will pay. Money managers who place
large orders drive up the demand, and with it the shares' cost _ to
their own detriment. The larger the transaction, the more
significant the market impact.
</P>
<P>
   Market impact costs are more likely to result from trades in
small- and mid-capitalization stocks, because their smaller numbers
of shares provide a less-liquid market and make them more
vulnerable to price swings. Still, a big-enough trade can create
market impact costs in large-cap stocks, too.
</P>
<P>
   Suppose that a manager who expects a company's stock price to
increase 10 percent places a large order for shares priced at $20
each, and that the market responds by pushing up the price by $1.
That is a 5 percent increase, cutting by half the potential profit
in the purchase.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brokers send bills to cover their transaction costs, but the
market doesn't send you a bill,'' Torre said. He figures that in a
fairly typical case, a small- or mid-cap stock fund with $500
million in assets and an annual turnover rate of 80 to 100 percent
could lose three to five percentage points a year in returns
because of market impact costs _ considerably more than the annual
expenses of the average mutual fund.
</P>
<P>
   Barra recently analyzed 150 domestic equity mutual funds _ all
with more than $100 million in assets and a track record of least
five years _ for 1996, 1997 and 1998. Among small-cap growth funds,
PBHG Emerging Growth had the highest market impact cost, at 5.73
percent; among mid-cap growth funds, Dresdner RCM Growth Equity was
on top, at 5.23 percent. The figures are estimates based on the
fund's operating style, using a mix of current and historical data.
</P>
<P>
   Some large-cap funds also had high market impact costs. American
Century Equity Growth led the list of large-cap value funds, at
3.29 percent. And another large-cap fund, Phoenix Engemann
Aggressive Growth, had the highest of all, at 8.13 percent. (A
spokeswoman for the fund said that different management was in
charge for most of the period and that the figure did not reflect
the current manager's style.)
</P>
<P>
   To calculate market impact, Barra created a computer model that
weighs more than 20 factors, including trading volume, volatility
and price elasticity for individual stocks. The model covers the
10,000 publicly traded American stockshopes to expand its data base
next year to include international issues.
</P>
<P>
   Rekenthaler offered a caution, though, about the model's
assumptions. For instance, the model might understate market impact
when a fund is run by a big company where many funds trade the same
stocks simultaneously. The figure would also be off if a fund
manager traded stocks significantly more or less often than in the
past. Over all, though, he concluded, ``In most cases, it should
give you a good ball-park figure.''

<P>
   GYM-TALES (New York) _ The less you spend on your health, the
healthier you become. This is why Kenyans, training barefoot on the
savanna, routinely obliterate America's best runners, despite
millions spent on college training programs. And if the logic here
is flawed, I don't want to hear about it. By Doug Cooper.

   EUROPEAN-WEDDINGS (Sintra, Portugal) _ The newest place for

Monique Yazigi.
</P>
<P>
   SEX-IN-THE-CITY (Undated) _ The success of Sex and the City, now
midway through its second season, has taken even some of HBO's
executives by surprise. Last year, when the pilot was being edited,
some at the pay channel wondered if the racy, profane, decidedly
insidery look at the dating scene in New York would fly in other
markets. But Sex and the City, which is based loosely on a New York
Observer column by Candace Bushnell and created by Darren Starr of
``Melrose Place'' fame, has gained the stirring of a cult
following, not only in New York and big cities like Los Angeles and
San Francisco, but, according to HBO, in places like Cleveland,
Providence and Baton Rouge. By Nancy Hass.

<P>
   COWIE-ELEGANCE (New York) _ For whatever reason, I recently
accepted an invitation to dine at a new restaurant called City
Hall, for a taping of ``Everyday Elegance With Colin Cowie,'' a
cable television series about ``life as it should be,'' shown on
the Romance Classics and American Movie Classics networks. Life as
it should be, of course, isn't what it used to be. By Bob Morris.

</P>
<P>
   (moving in the `a' category)
</P>
<P>
   LEFT-RIGHT-REVIEW (Undated) _ Liberals and conservatives as
strange bedfellows: Politics has long forged odd alliances but
there is clearly something significant happening to the national
debate when Vietnam doves morph into Kosovo hawks and presidential
front-runners rebuff traditional party militants to capture the
center when the nomination process has barely begun. Not long ago,
when people were described as ``left'' or ``right,'' liberal or
conservative, Democrat or Republican, their views on a range of
issues _ on religion and state, education, war and peace, taxation
_ could be inferred. That's no longer the case. By Ethan Bronner.
</P>
<P>
   FUGITIVE-FINANCIERS-REVIEW (Undated) _ The tale of Martin
Frankel is already enhancing the lore of that most modern of
outlaws, the fugitive financier. There have been a surprising
number of them in the last three decades, with Robert Vesco being
perhaps the most notorious. And their stories serve as a reminder
that even millions of dollars of loot cannot happiness, at least
when you're on the lam. By Timothy Eaton.
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moving in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   APPALACHIA-REVIEW (Undated) _ When President Clinton visited
Appalachia to call attention to poverty, his visit had a familiar
air. The Kennedys and LBJ had made the trip more than 3 decades
ago. But although some poverty persists, Appalachia is a very
different place with very different economic development needs than
it was in the '60s. What never seems to change is the mythology of
the place as the poster child for American poverty, an image that
persists, to the region's detriment and benefit, no matter how much
times change. By Peter Applebome.
</P>
<P>
   PRIVATE-SCHOOLS-REVIEW (Undated) _ For many urban parents,
agonizing over whether to send their children to public or private
schools has become a ritual fraught with concerns about money and
fears that a public-school education is a sentence to a life of
second-class opportunities. But hard evidence comparing the
performance of public and nonpublic schools has proven elusive.
Now, though, New York state has released test scores that provide a
rare basis for side-by-side comparison, with surprising results:
There were only modest differences in the performance of private
schools _ mainly Catholic ones _ and public schools. By Anemona
Hartocollis.
</P>
<P>
   CALIF-INSECTS-REVIEW (Los Angeles) _ The last corner of L.A.
County's 4,000 square miles was recently declared officially
colonized by Africanized honeybees. Science has been powerless to
stop the bees' steady northward march from South America. But
Californians have reacted to this latest invader with equanimity
because their state has long been home to a rogues' gallery of
flying, crawling pestilence. By Todd S. Purdum.
</P>
<P>
   SPORTS-DRUGS-REVIEW (Undated) _ The suspicions also are
familiar. If an athlete does very well, or if an athlete develops
an injury of illness, charges of drug use spring up automatically.
This raises questions about the ethics of drug use in sports. What
is it, some ask, that is at the root of society's horror of
performance-enhancing drugs? By Gina Kolata.
</P>
<P>
   LAWYERS-CHARACTER-REVIEW (Undated) _ Character review is as much
a part of becoming a lawyer as passing a bar exam. The arcane
character-and-fitness process, unknown to most of the public but
hotly debated within the profession, is facing new scrutiny after a
drive-by shooting rampage last weekend by a disciple of Matthew
Hale, a white supremacist who had been rejected by Illinois bar
examiners on moral grounds. By Mike Allen.
</P>
<P>
   HEMINGWAY-HYPE-TEXT-REVIEW (Undated) _ Ernest Hemingway
brilliantly cultivated his own elephantine public image during his
30-year reign as America's most famous writer. But the rough,
cantankerous Hemingway would probably have a difficult time
recognizing himself today in the hype overlicensed Hemingway
products, which reaches full-throttle this week in the buildup to
the centennial of his birth on July 21.
</P>
<P>
   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some highlights of the week, leading
with the pros and cons of swimming with dolphins, and the
possibility that George Washington fathered a child with a slave.
</P>
<P>
   _ Moving in the `i' category:
</P>
<P>
   JAPAN-ALIBIS-REVIEW (Tokyo) _ Alibis for sale in Japan provide
bogus ``respectability.'' The alibi-ya are essentially conjurers
who help people at the margins of society. For instance, women in
the sex industry are frequent clients of the alibi-ya, which enable
them to tell relatives and even boyfriends about their fine jobs in
a trading company. The alibi-ya provide name cards, pay stubs and
an impressive position in a decent line of work _ all fictitious.
If a caller tries to reach the young woman while she is at her
nonexistent job, a polite receptionist will say she has stepped
out. By Nicholas D. Kristof.
</P>
<P>
   TIBET-LOBBY-REVIEW (Washington) _ A behind-the-scenes look at
why the pro-Tibet lobby can be so effective in Washington. Tibet
sympathizers, who have included figures as diverse as right-wing
Sen. Jesse Helms and the Beastie Boys rock music group, caused the
U.S. to reverse its stance and come out against a World Bank loan
to China intended to help establish Chinese farmers on land the
Tibetans say is traditionally theirs. By David E. Sanger.

   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, July 11, will move Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   On the dress page:
</P>
<P>
   (moving in the `a' category)
</P>
<P>
   LEFT-RIGHT-REVIEW (Undated) _ Liberals and conservatives as
strange bedfellows: Politics has long forged odd alliances but
there is clearly something significant happening to the national
debate when Vietnam doves morph into Kosovo hawks and presidential
front-runners rebuff traditional party militants to capture the
center when the nomination process has barely begun. Not long ago,
when people were described as ``left'' or ``right,'' liberal or
conservative, Democrat or Republican, their views on a range of
issues _ on religion and state, education, war and peace, taxation
_ could be inferred. That's no longer the case. By Ethan Bronner.
</P>
<P>
   FUGITIVE-FINANCIERS-REVIEW (Undated) _ The tale of Martin
Frankel is already enhancing the lore of that most modern of
outlaws, the fugitive financier. There have been a surprising
number of them in the last three decades, with Robert Vesco being
perhaps the most notorious. And their stories serve as a reminder
that even millions of dollars of loot cannot happiness, at least
when you're on the lam. By Timothy Eaton.
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moving in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   APPALACHIA-REVIEW (Undated) _ When President Clinton visited
Appalachia to call attention to poverty, his visit had a familiar
air. The Kennedys and LBJ had made the trip more than 3 decades
ago. But although some poverty persists, Appalachia is a very
different place with very different economic development needs than
it was in the '60s. What never seems to change is the mythology of
the place as the poster child for American poverty, an image that
persists, to the region's detriment and benefit, no matter how much
times change. By Peter Applebome.
</P>
<P>
   PRIVATE-SCHOOLS-REVIEW (Undated) _ For many urban parents,
agonizing over whether to send their children to public or private
schools has become a ritual fraught with concerns about money and
fears that a public-school education is a sentence to a life of
second-class opportunities. But hard evidence comparing the
performance of public and nonpublic schools has proven elusive.
Now, though, New York state has released test scores that provide a
rare basis for side-by-side comparison, with surprising results:
There were only modest differences in the performance of private
schools _ mainly Catholic ones _ and public schools. By Anemona
Hartocollis.
</P>
<P>
   CALIF-INSECTS-REVIEW (Los Angeles) _ The last corner of L.A.
County's 4,000 square miles was recently declared officially
colonized by Africanized honeybees. Science has been powerless to
stop the bees' steady northward march from South America. But
Californians have reacted to this latest invader with equanimity
because their state has long been home to a rogues' gallery of
flying, crawling pestilence. By Todd S. Purdum.
</P>
<P>
   SPORTS-DRUGS-REVIEW (Undated) _ The suspicions also are
familiar. If an athlete does very well, or if an athlete develops
an injury of illness, charges of drug use spring up automatically.
This raises questions about the ethics of drug use in sports. What
is it, some ask, that is at the root of society's horror of
performance-enhancing drugs? By Gina Kolata.
</P>
<P>
   LAWYERS-CHARACTER-REVIEW (Undated) _ Character review is as much
a part of becoming a lawyer as passing a bar exam. The arcane
character-and-fitness process, unknown to most of the public but
hotly debated within the profession, is facing new scrutiny after a
drive-by shooting rampage last weekend by a disciple of Matthew
Hale, a white supremacist who had been rejected by Illinois bar
examiners on moral grounds. By Mike Allen.
</P>
<P>
   HEMINGWAY-HYPE-TEXT-REVIEW (Undated) _ Ernest Hemingway
brilliantly cultivated his own elephantine public image during his
30-year reign as America's most famous writer. But the rough,
cantankerous Hemingway would probably have a difficult time
recognizing himself today in the hype overlicensed Hemingway
products, which reaches full-throttle this week in the buildup to
the centennial of his birth on July 21.
</P>
<P>
   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some highlights of the week, leading
with the pros and cons of swimming with dolphins, and the
possibility that George Washington fathered a child with a slave.
</P>
<P>
   _ Moving in the `i' category:
</P>
<P>
   JAPAN-ALIBIS-REVIEW (Tokyo) _ Alibis for sale in Japan provide
bogus ``respectability.'' The alibi-ya are essentially conjurers
who help people at the margins of society. For instance, women in
the sex industry are frequent clients of the alibi-ya, which enable
them to tell relatives and even boyfriends about their fine jobs in
a trading company. The alibi-ya provide name cards, pay stubs and
an impressive position in a decent line of work _ all fictitious.
If a caller tries to reach the young woman while she is at her
nonexistent job, a polite receptionist will say she has stepped
out. By Nicholas D. Kristof.
</P>
<P>
   TIBET-LOBBY-REVIEW (Washington) _ A behind-the-scenes look at
why the pro-Tibet lobby can be so effective in Washington. Tibet
sympathizers, who have included figures as diverse as right-wing
Sen. Jesse Helms and the Beastie Boys rock music group, caused the
U.S. to reverse its stance and come out against a World Bank loan
to China intended to help establish Chinese farmers on land the
Tibetans say is traditionally theirs. By David E. Sanger.

SHOW SOME RESTRAINT WHEN DRIVING WITH YOUR DOG 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By VICKI CROKE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Will common training commands such as ``Sit!'' and ``Stay!''
soon be joined by ``Buckle up?''
</P>
<P>
   The accident injuring horror novelist Stephen King last month
seems to have touched off a great buzz about safety belts for pets.
In the accident, a van driver in Maine was distracted by his unruly
Rottweiler and swerved into King as he was out for a stroll. King
is now recuperating.
</P>
<P>
   Press releases have since poured in. ``Cujo's Revenge: Steven
(sic) King Accident Highlights Need For Pet Travel Safety'' reads
one.
</P>
<P>
   Phone calls to leading veterinary hospitals reveal that several
major TV newsmagazines are dogging the issue.
</P>
<P>
   And on top of it all, Saab has just announced it is the first
car company to offer ``a full line of vehicle accessories
specifically designed for pets who travel,'' including the
trademarked ``Batzi Belt,'' a pet restraint system that attaches to
a safety belt.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Marty Smith, a veterinarian and one of the founders of the
Doctors Foster &AMP; Smith pet catalog, says the company sells
thousands of these kinds of devices each year. After all, there are
38 million of us dog owners in the United States, and, according to
the Humane Society, half of owners report traveling frequently with
dogs.
</P>
<P>
   Smith has seen the consequences. He recounts an incident in
1980, when a woman driving up to his clinic lost control of her car
because her golden retriever pup had jumped down at the pedals. Her
car plowed right through the clinic's outer wall, coming to rest at
the far side of the waiting room. (Both doctors were away, and no
one was in the waiting room at the time.)
</P>
<P>
   Smith says this incident made a few things clear to him. He
reminds how loose animals in cars can cause accidents; they also
might become airborne during an accident and injure themselves or
people; furthermore, he suspects they may distract us even when
they are stationary.
</P>
<P>
   Studies have shown, Smith says, that because dogs don't talk, we
make more eye contact with them than with humans in order to
communicate. He thinks we probably do a lot more of that while
driving than we realize. We may turn our gaze away from the road
for a few seconds at a time to check on our napping companions.
(Maybe those dash-mounted rear-view mirrors for parents would
help).
</P>
<P>
   Smith says he has treated dogs with broken jaws and legs who
have been tossed about or slammed into dashboards during accidents.
He says that seat restraints, steel mesh buffers and grills, and
crates or carriers help prevent or minimize some accidents.
</P>
<P>
   That makes sense, but the subject gets murkier.
</P>
<P>
   The strange thing is that, with no statistics available on the
issue, two of the biggest animal hospitals in the country _ Angell
Memorial here in Boston, and the Animal Medical Center in New York
_ are hard-pressed to come up with even a couple of examples of
dogs treated for injuries sustained in car accidents. That's dogs
traveling inside cars as opposed to dogs hit by cars.
</P>
<P>
   The TV newsmagazines, always seeking a fresh angle, have been
calling, spokeswomen from both organizations report, but vets at
both places had to wrack their brains to come up with just one or
two examples from the last decade. This from doctors who deal with
thousands of pet injuries each year.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Paul Maloney, spokesman for the Massachusetts State Police,
says that in his 29 years on the force, he has never had an
incident in which he had to find medical attention for a dog
injured inside a car during an accident. A quick survey of his
colleagues available in the office confirmed his thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   There have been a few cases in which healthy pets have been
brought back to the station when an owner was injured. But there is
no protocol for dealing with injured pets, and there just doesn't
seem to be a great need for one, he says.
</P>
<P>
   That's all pretty surprising. But regardless, Saab points out,
logically, that pets in the car are subject to the same hazards as
the human occupants. You may not want to rely on statistical
evidence in deciding to restrain four-legged Rover in your
four-wheeled Land Rover.

BEIJING SEEMS TO LOSE THE BATTLE OVER WHO IS THE REAL LAMA 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By SETH FAISON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUOFU, China _ In a carpet shop in this dusty town in Sichuan
province, east of Tibet, two photographs are prominently displayed
on the main wall.
</P>
<P>
   One is of the Dalai Lama, Tibet's exiled spiritual leader, who
is worshiped by Tibetans as both a god and a king. The other is of
a 10-year-old boy who was selected in 1995 by a committee of
Tibetan elders as the reincarnation of the Panchen Lama, Tibet's
second-most important religious figure.
</P>
<P>
   The boy, Gedhun Choekyi Nyima, disappeared later that year into
the custody of Chinese authorities, prompting accusations from
exiled Tibetan activists that he had become the youngest political
prisoner in the world.
</P>
<P>
   The boy's detention immediately became the crux of a bizarre
political struggle that highlights the vigorous battle for
religious and political legitimacy by 6 million Tibetans who live
in territory ruled by China, both in Tibet proper and in the area
around Luofu and in other parts of the Tibetan plateau that spill
into adjoining provinces.
</P>
<P>
   In late June, Chinese authorities escorted another young boy,
ordained by Beijing as the official choice to be Panchen Lama, to
the traditional seat of power for that post in Shigatse, Tibet.
Official versions asserted that the rightful ruler was taking his
rightful place.
</P>
<P>
   Yet this second boy, Gyaincain Norbu, who is just 9 years old,
was escorted by a team of armed guards, including sharpshooters who
were positioned on rooftops, apparently out of fear that the boy is
in danger of assassination, despite official claims that he is
universally loved by the people.
</P>
<P>
   Here in a Tibetan-populated area of western Sichuan Province and
in many adjoining areas, ordinary Tibetans and monks overwhelmingly
seem to prefer the first boy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all love him,'' said the proprietor of the carpet shop, a
57-year-old woman with long braids and thick glasses. ``No one
listens to Beijing.''
</P>
<P>
   In countless other stores, homes and Buddhist temples, the
photograph of the first boy is in evidence, while the second boy's
picture is virtually invisible.
</P>
<P>
   The fight is rooted in the delicate question of how to replace
the previous Panchen Lama, who died unexpectedly at the age of 50
in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, worried that exiled Tibetans might try to secretly
name their own Panchen Lama, Beijing authorized a search group to
find a reincarnation whom they could control as a pro-China
figurehead. They entrusted the abbot of Tashilumpo Monastery, the
traditional seat of power for the Panchen Lama's sect of Tibetan
Buddhism, to oversee the process.
</P>
<P>
   A boy was duly found, in the same mystical fashion used to
select previous Dalai and Panchen Lamas, with Tibetan elders
traveling to a holy lake, waiting for revelatory hints about where
to hunt, and following a path of arcane clues. Hoping to unify
Tibetan exiles behind the Beijing-approved choice, the abbot
quietly asked the Dalai Lama for his approval, which he gave in the
spring of 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Yet before the choice had been finally approved and announced in
Beijing, representatives of the Dalai Lama surprised Chinese
leaders by announcing that a new Panchen Lama had been discovered.
</P>
<P>
   Beijing was so angered that it denounced the choice, put the boy
and his parents under detention, arrested the abbot, and announced
that a new boy would be selected _ by an old method: drawing ivory
lots from a golden urn. A new Panchen Lama was proclaimed in
November 1995.

INDONESIA MILITARY SORTS OUT ITS ROLE  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By SETH MYDANS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ Every morning, marine guards prop their
plastic riot shields in menacing rows outside the Parliament
building. Then, shirts off, they jog around the seat of Indonesia's
government as if they own the place, chanting aggressively.
</P>
<P>
   But this is not a confident army _ its morale and its public
image have been battered by the country's recent turmoil _ and it
no longer knows just what role it is to play inside the Parliament
building, where it has dominated the work of the government for a
generation.
</P>
<P>
   Painfully, hesitantly, Indonesia's influential military has
begun to re-define itself, giving away power and privileges in an
attempt to become more professional and less overtly political.
</P>
<P>
   The process of official introspection began well before
President Suharto was forced to resign in May 1998. It has
intensified under the pressure of the reform movement that has been
driving Indonesia toward greater democratic openness in the year
since then.
</P>
<P>
   But in the midst of this retrenchment, the 300,000-man military
suddenly finds itself thrown back into the political spotlight by a
new surge in its own influence.
</P>
<P>
   It appears that in the coming months, the military will be in a
position to play its most overt political role since Suharto took
office 33 years ago and turned it into his personal enforcement
machine. In the past, the power it wielded was Suharto's, not its
own.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the results of a parliamentary election held on June 7
heading for an apparent deadlock between the two leading party
coalitions, more and more political analysts predict that a small,
unified military voting bloc may be in a position to determine who
will become Indonesia's next president.
</P>
<P>
   ``The military may actually be put in the position of being
kingmaker, in other words, dictating the winner,'' said Adam
Schwarz, an expert on Indonesia who is the author of ``A Nation in
Waiting'' (Westview Press, 1994).
</P>
<P>
   This would be a remarkable outcome for an election that was
widely described as Indonesia's first democratic vote in four
decades.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not clear what effect the military's influence would
have. It does not appear bent on seizing power for itself, it does
not appear to wish to halt its process of depoliticization and it
does not appear to have a clear favorite among the leading
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond this, it is not necessarily an antidemocratic force.
Juwono Sudarsono, an expert on the military who is now minister of
education, noted that the armed forces, under its commander, Gen.
Wiranto, upheld a constitutional change of power last year rather
than trying to seize control for itself when Suharto stepped down.
</P>
<P>
   ``One tends to forget that Wiranto, for all his faults and
failings, put the emphasis on civilian supremacy on that day, May
21,'' Jusono said. ``One could say he laid the foundation for
civilian supremacy.''
</P>
<P>
   With Suharto's departure, the military finds itself reviled more
openly than ever for its past behavior _ the kidnapping, torture
and killings of his critics, the bullying of the official
opposition, including Megawati Sukarnoputri, the corruption and
brutality of its local commanders and its heavy-handed crackdowns
on dissidents and separatists, particularly in East Timor and the
province of Aceh.
</P>
<P>
   As part of its retreat from power, the military accepted a
crucial step this year in reducing its political involvement,
agreeing to a cut in its allotted parliamentary seats, to 38 from
75.
</P>
<P>
   But political analysts say the number of seats it effectively
controls could rise in the current election to 45 or even 55 with
the addition of other officers appointed by regional parliaments.
``On that basis, it could be the third or fourth major force in the
MPR,'' a Western diplomat said, referring to the 700-member
electoral assembly by its initials. ``This could give it the
crucial balance of power.''
</P>
<P>
   But what would the military do with this power?
</P>
<P>
   It does not appear to have a clear agenda, the military analysts
say, apart from making sure it is on the winning side and from
assuring that it can keep control over its own reform.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the vigor of the election process and the turning point
it represents in Indonesia's shift toward a more democratic
society, there do not at the moment appear to be significant issues
that divide the main contenders for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   And with their growing awareness of the potential decisiveness
of the military's role, both blocs appear to be ready to
accommodate its needs.
</P>
<P>
   On one side is Golkar, the governing party, whose presidential
candidate _ for the moment at least _ is the incumbent, B.J.
Habibie, who succeeded Suharto from his post as vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Wiranto has worked loyally and professionally with Habibie, but
it is not clear how deep their personal or political relationship
goes.
</P>
<P>
   Both men share the political liability of their close
association with Suharto. Some analysts say the military's poor
public image would be further weakened if the military were seen as
taking the decisive step to keep in power a government beholden to
Suharto.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side is the party of Mrs. Megawati, which is the
focus of the hopes of many reformers and which appears to have won
a clear plurality in the June vote, which is still being counted.
</P>
<P>
   But with one-third of the seats in a presidential assembly
appointed rather than elected, and with coalition-building becoming
increasingly complex, a victory for Mrs. Megawati is far from
assured.
</P>
<P>
   On issues of importance to the military, some analysts say, she
might be more compatible than Habibie, and she has made what seem
to be gestures toward pleasing the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   She has voiced caution over changing the constitution that has
allowed the military to exercise power.
</P>
<P>
   She is a strong supporter of a unified state and a skeptic about
independence for the disputed territory of East Timor. And she has
suggested that she would not vigorously pursue past abuses, which
notably include the corruption of Suharto and the killings and
brutality of the military.
</P>
<P>
   Salim Said, a political analyst who is an expert on the
military, said the armed forces would prefer not to have to make
the choice at all and are pressing the two blocs to find their own
compromise.
</P>
<P>
   Politics just has not worked for the military, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They see themselves as moving away from day-to-day politics,
partisan politics,'' he said, ``because their experience of
overreach in politics in the Suharto era was a disaster.''

BUSH BROTHERS CHALLENGED ON ABORTION ISSUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Southern Exposure is the weekly political notebook from the
Washington Bureau of the New York Times Regional Newspapers)  
 (bl)  
 By CARL HULSE and SEAN LOUGHLIN   
 NYT Regional Newspapers   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ George W. Bush and Jeb Bush have something in
common besides sibling ties and serving as governors of large
Sunbelt states. A top abortion-rights group says the duo also
oversaw active anti-abortion legislative agendas in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   As the positioning begins over the divisive issue in advance of
the 2000 elections, the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights
Action League put Texas and Florida among its top five states for
most new abortion restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   Texas, where GOP presidential front-runner George W. Bush is
governor, enacted seven new laws limiting abortion access, placing
it No. 1 on NARAL's hit list.
</P>
<P>
   Florida, led by younger brother Jeb, earned the fifth spot by
adopting two laws: one requiring that a doctor seek parental
consent before performing an abortion on a minor and another
authorizing a new pro-life license plate.
</P>
<P>
   NARAL officials said the legislative activity flies in the face
of attempts by the Bush brothers to portray themselves as relative
moderates on the abortion issue _ anti-abortion themselves but not
committed to pursuing a hard-line stance. Jeb Bush softened his
rhetoric during his 1998 campaign and George W. Bush indicated he
would not require a vice presidential choice or Supreme Court
nominee to share his views on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the record now shows, Bush and the Texas Legislature are
indeed leaders when it comes to restricting the reproductive rights
of women,'' said NARAL president Kate Michelman.
</P>
<P>
   But the Bushes say they are only endorsing common-sense
approaches such as giving a parent some say in an important medical
decision involving a child. And they have drawn strong support from
women voters.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans in general have toned down their talk on abortion,
recognizing it as a subject that has cost them votes in the past.
The new GOP strategy has been to pursue legislation that can
attract centrist support, proposals such as the partial-birth
abortion ban and consent requirements for minors.
</P>
<P>
   TALKING HEADS
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., isn't often confused with Tom
Brokaw or Peter Jennings, but he has been on television almost as
much as the network stars.
</P>
<P>
   Shelby scored the second most Sunday talk show appearances by a
senator this year on a list compiled by Roll Call, the Capitol Hill
newspaper. The lawmaker appeared 14 times so far in 1999, second
only to Joseph Lieberman, D- Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Shelby was a big draw during the impeachment proceedings,
standing out among Republicans for his reservations about the House
case against President Clinton. And as chairman of the Intelligence
Committee, he has been sought after for his views on espionage at
nuclear weapons facilities as well as the war in Kosovo and the
bombing of the Chinese embassy.
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't the only Southerner to regularly face the likes of Tim
Russert and Cokie Roberts. Sen. John Breaux, D-La., a congressional
expert on Medicare known for his colorful sound bites, was also
among the leaders.
</P>
<P>
   POWER STRUGGLE
</P>
<P>
   The Tennessee Valley Authority continues to serve as a whipping
boy for congressional critics.
</P>
<P>
   With some lawmakers determined to cut any federal subsidies for
the utility, Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., is attacking the TVA on a
new front _ electric rates.
</P>
<P>
   McConnell this month introduced a measure that would subject the
TVA to the same scrutiny other utilities get, forcing the agency to
justify its consumer rates and other charges. McConnell complained
that TVA's heavy debt has driven its rates upward while other
utilities have cut charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a self-regulated monopoly, TVA has not been accountable to
its captive ratepayers,'' said McConnell.
</P>
<P>
   VETERANS BATTLE
</P>
<P>
   Attempts to shake-up the way the Department of Veterans Affairs
delivers health care to thousands of vets have reverberated through
the top ranks of the agency. Both VA Secretary Togo West and agency
health care chief Kenneth Kizer are on their way out.
</P>
<P>
   Kizer, who has shifted resources from the Northeast and Midwest
to the South with the migration of veterans, angered federal
employee advocates and other interest groups with his aggressive
push to move the agency away from hospital care to more reliance on
outpatient clinics. The physician chose not to seek reconfirmation
rather than endure a Senate battle.
</P>
<P>
   West came under fire for his personal conduct, drawing criticism
for his frequent travel and a decision to order a new luxury car
for his official use when his agency was facing a budget crisis.

   (UNDATED) ... one good handbag.``
</P>
<P>
   A key ingredient that observers of French style mention
frequently is presentation.
</P>
<P>
   ``A $5 item is wrapped like it cost $50,'' said Rives, ``and
that extends to their clothing style.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, for outsiders, it is often difficult to penetrate the
French faade.
</P>
<P>
   ``The French are wonderful people,'' said Rives, ``but until you
get to know them, they are a little reserved, especially compared
to Italians, who are sort of like the Texans of the
Mediterranean.''
</P>
<P>
   The French like to do a lot of entertaining at home, but only
for people they know well. Rives describes their homes as a mixture
of old French with modern _ ``old velvet curtains with a
contemporary suede couch.''
</P>
<P>
   In fashion, the concept of professional business dress for women
does not exist in France.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wear dark clothes and never wear white sneakers,'' said
Georgene Brandon, head of community relations and special events
for PricewaterhouseCoopers, a business advisory firm with offices
in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's how the women put their clothes together _ so chic, and
it looks so uncomplicated,'' she said. ``They have less in their
wardrobes but better quality. They can wear a black skirt and a
white blouse, and it looks so sharp but important and
professional.''
</P>
<P>
   Brandon also believes that it is possible to absorb French
style, especially by spending as much time there as possible
``eating, watching and wearing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``After I visited our Paris office, it made me take a new look
at how we do things,'' she said. ``When I told them we had
breakfast meetings at 7 a.m., they were horrified. They start a
breakfast meeting at 9, at the civilized hour, and it's not `grab a
danish and a Slurpee.' They really have tables, are seated and have
a lighter breakfast than we do, with fruit, croissants and
prserves. They don't cram in as many meetings as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Bentley credits some of the French sophistication to geography.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are well-traveled because of where they live. It gives
them more attitude and more cultural knowledge. More people know
more languages and so appear more sophisticated. And, too, they
take monthlong holidays every summer.''
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Bearden is another Texan who has come to love the French
lifestyle. Bearden has visited France three times in the last two
years and admires the French imagination.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are daring and try things other people wouldn't even
think to try. When you first see some of these things, you think,
`Oh, I wouldn't do that.' But when you try it on ... ''
</P>
<P>
   She most recently fell for a long, sheer skirt worn over a
short, opaque mini, and she bought a black Thierry Mugler skirted
cocktail suit with red velvet cuffs. Now she wears the suit jacket
with a pair of black Gap pants.
</P>
<P>
   But Bearden said she doesn't credit the French woman for style
as much as she credits the French designer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It amazes me when I travel over there and everyone is dressed
in drab black, summer and winter. But their love of flowers amazes
me. There is a stand on every corner, and they take time out to buy
flowers and appreciate them.''

(Refiling for those needing) &HT;    HOW TO ACQUIRE THE LOOK
 &HT;    w/FRENCH STYLE MAINBAR &HT;    By LINDA GILLAN GRIFFIN
 &HT;    c. 1999 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   (UNDATED) While the subject of what French style is wanders all
over the map, the guidelines on how to acquire it are more
specific.
</P>
<P>
   First, study French. Not only the language but the style. June
Rives, owner of June Rives Public Relations in Houston, said she
learns a lot about French style from magazines such as the French
Marie Claire and Elle, ``but obviously, direct observation is
best.'' For example, last October when she was in Paris, every
woman was in black leather _ ``just like in L.A.'' Visit antiques
shops to learn about French styles, museums to see French art and
foreign movies to see the French lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   Keep up on fashion. While the French are not label-conscious _
you won't see designer names on their clothing or a French woman in
Chanel's big double-C jewelry _ they are very aware of fashion. For
example, the French are currently gaga over American Michael Kors'
designs for the French line Celine, and the newest Paris Gap is
opening on the Champs lyses.
</P>
<P>
   Be daring. Most fashion finds at French flea markets tend to the
exotic _ beads, paisley shawls, embroidered jackets, blouses,
skirts and shawls. These are often great for party or evening wear.
Try an embroidered Indian jacket with a pair of good white or black
pants, adding a shawl, dangling earrings or cuff bracelets. Sheer,
beaded dresses from the 1920s are perfect evening attire worn over
matching slips. Watch out for vintage bags that tend to look dated.
</P>
<P>
   Age gracefully. One reason Parisian women appear to age well is
because, surrounded by designers, they stay current on fashion,
said Gayla Bentley, a fashion consultant who also leads shopping
and style tours to Paris. ``People of all economic levels have more
of an understanding and respect for designers than in America, even
if they can't afford those clothes,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Walk more. Europeans walk a lot, so despite the rich sauces, the
olive oil and the wine, many don't find it hard to stay fit and
trim.
</P>
<P>
   Forget faux body parts. ``In the United States,'' said Bentley,
``women spend a lot of money having fake nails put on, but no one
does that in France. They spend money on skin care, not nails or
boobs. Everything is real. And at St. Tropez and the Riviera, women
of all ages are going topless and proud of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Dress simply but chicly. French women almost never go over the
top, and while they buy less, they buy the best they can afford. If
they cannot afford the very best, they visit it often to
familiarize themselves with what makes it best. Then they buy the
best similar styles they can afford.
</P>
<P>
   Eschew fashion fakes. Wearing the real thing is important to the
French. They will never carry a fake Louis Vuitton or a fake Rolex.
</P>
<P>
   Don't overdo. Especially accessories. One good piece of jewelry
or one Herms scarf with an Herms or Louis Vuitton bag does the
French trick.
</P>
<P>
   Make up naturally. Most French women are minimalists in their
makeup and, with well-cared-for skin, they can afford to be. You
will never see the typical French woman in extreme rouge or eye
makeup. Their hair is simple, in ponytails or chignons or cropped
short.
</P>
<P>
   Schedule skin care. French women take very good care of their
skin, said Laura Mercier, whose cosmetic line will be joined by a
new line of skin-care products in September. The French learn skin
care at a very early age and usually avoid tanning.
</P>
<P>
   Wear perfume. But wear it sparingly. A pleasing fragrance is
like a petit cadeau (a little gift) that one person offers another.
Most women enjoy catching a whiff of men's fragrances as much as
men enjoy women in perfume.
</P>
<P>
   Iron things. The French often iron their underwear, socks and
jeans. Why? Because clothes dryers are not as common in France as
in the States, so ironing softens fabrics. The coincidental removal
of wrinkles gives the French a more polished look.
</P>
<P>
   Don't overdecorate. Europeans in general avoid the decorated
look in homes, preferring an eclectic mix of antiques and
contemporary furnishings. The French would never have an entire
house of French provincial or Louis the anything.
</P>
<P>
   Do the unexpected. Paint your bathroom yellow, your claw-footed
tub aubergine, and hang family portraits on the wall.
</P>
<P>
   Acquire heritage. If you did not inherit antique furnishings,
buy some. The French are famous for haunting flea markets,
especially the Marche aux Puces, where one can find everything from
tassels to tinsel. Even in a thoroughly modern loft, a single
antique chair or table can lend credence.
</P>
<P>
   Rethink country. With the American penchant for casualness,
country styles have lingered for decades now. For a more
sophisticated look, try country French. You know the look _ olive
jars, lots of natural woods, baskets, lace curtains, blue, white
and yellow.
</P>
<P>
   Don't dust. Although Paris apartments owned by Americans are
immaculate, clean enough to eat off the floors, the French are not
allergic to a little dust. It gives a patina of age to newer
furnishings.
</P>
<P>
   Develop attitude. If, as Mercier said, French women are full of
complexes and insecurities, they cover it well. The secret is in
being the best you can be. Look your best and don't worry.
</P>
<P>
   Get a dog. And train it. Dogs are everywhere in France, almost
accessories, said Bentley, but they are well-behaved and treated
with respect.

(Refiling for those needing) &HT;    FRENCH STYLE: WHAT IS IT, AND HOW DO YOU GET IT? &HT;    By LINDA GILLAN GRIFFIN
 &HT;    c. 1999 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   (UNDATED) Ask most Americans who embodies style, and they almost
invariably point to the French.
</P>
<P>
   Coco Chanel. Catherine Deneuve. Even Brigitte Bardot, who for a
few moments in history epitomized everything some viewed as French,
mainly sizzle and skin.
</P>
<P>
   As first lady, Jacqueline Kennedy had French style, and among
the British, both Princesses Diana and Fergie coveted it.
</P>
<P>
   But ask Americans what constitutes French style, and they have a
hard time putting their fingers on it. The women look put together,
they'll say, not overdone. And they always know what to do with a
scarf.
</P>
<P>
   While Paris is indeed considered the cradle of fashion, French
style is more than that. There is a certain je ne sais quoi, as the
Gauls themselves would put it, about the way a French woman puts
herself together.
</P>
<P>
   For another thing, men dig it.
</P>
<P>
   Skirts in the States tend to fall straight from the hips, but in
France they are tighter, cupping the buttocks, and are often worn
with high heels that tighten and shape the legs.
</P>
<P>
   Men dig the way French women wear fresh, white men's shirts with
their jeans and even men's jackets, all elements of sportswear but
worn with femininity. Maybe the shirt collar's worn up, and for
sure the hair is shiny and clean, and the skin flawless.
</P>
<P>
   And men dig the way French women wear boots with skirts and
suits, exposing leg between the hem and boot tops. And at night,
they go for everything from simplest black to no-holds-barred
glamour.
</P>
<P>
   American women like it that their French counterparts wear hats
that are truly confections to weddings _ and without a speck of
self-consciousness. Basically, a casual approach to fashion that
comes off as trs, trs chic to Americans.
</P>
<P>
   But French style goes much deeper than wearing a cartwheel hat
or casually tying on a scarf that costs as much as a month's
groceries. It involves not only fashion but beauty, attitude and
lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   French style is in the home, the furniture they choose, the
tables they set, the flowers they arrange, the shopping bags they
tote to market and the sunglasses they wear for driving. French
style is in the food _ not only snails, sauces and mystery meats
but pt, souffls, steak frites (steak and French fries, to you) and
those long, crusty loaves of French bread called baguettes.
</P>
<P>
   The French have an ability unique among cultures, write Suzanne
Slesin and Stafford Cliff, authors of ``French Style'' (Potter,
$35), ``to be perceived as a more cultured, more elegant, more
stylish people, and to make others feel at some disadvantage in not
being born French themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Slesin and Cliff wrote of interior design and the
essentially Gallic way of arranging objects to best advantage, the
statement also applies to French everything, especially fashion.
</P>
<P>
   The French have almost institutionalized their style. So
confident are they that names such as Coco Chanel, Christian Dior,
Givenchy, Herms and Louis Vuitton can exist almost in perpetuity
that those houses now have designers who are German, British,
Belgian or American.
</P>
<P>
   Part of what constitutes French style is the element of
surprise. Yet the surprise is that the French themselves have
trouble pinning down what that element of shock is or how it is
achieved.
</P>
<P>
   ``French style is good champagne, costly perfume and a great
haircut,'' said Vronique Vienne in ``French Style: How to Think,
Shop and Dress Like a French Woman'' (Express, $20).
</P>
<P>
   When Vienne, born and raised in Paris, moved to the United
States, she found everyone expected her to live up to his or her
ideal of a typical Parisian woman _ ``with a beret, red lipstick
... and a baguette under my arm. Men were disappointed because I
did not wear fishnet stockings. Their wives assumed I was going to
be an outrageous flirt.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Vienne, a French woman does not flaunt her
Frenchness but never lets one forget she is a woman, although she
can't define what a woman is.
</P>
<P>
   Vienne describes the French fashion style as a mixed metaphor _
white socks with black lace, menswear with ruffles. Those surprises
again. But is it instinct or a learned art?
</P>
<P>
   Houstonian June Rives believes that French style is absorbed as
a child.
</P>
<P>
   As president and owner of June Rives Public Relations, she
represents Air France and travels to France frequently.
</P>
<P>
   ``The French overall, especially French women, have a certain
basic, natural, inbred style. It's obvious when you walk down the
street: They accessorize beautifully, wear very fine shoes, the
finest fabrics,'' Rives said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even the simplest, most modest-income Parisian woman is taught
how to put accessories together _ to look simply chic. It's almost
done without thought. I've never seen a French woman that looked
unkempt,'' she said, ``compared to British men, who look like
unmade beds. The French men and women are always well-dressed, hair
well-groomed. Even if they don't have a lot of money, they'll spend
money to buy one Herms scarf, one good handbag.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The ballroom was jumping with Chilean music, and
plates of hors d'oeuvres were circulating. But the wine very nearly
missed its own party.
</P>
<P>
   The occasion was the New York introduction of Sena, the product
of a high-visibility joint venture between the Robert Mondavi
Winery and Vina Errazuriz of Chile. What stands out about the
arrangement is its ownership structure, one that until recently
most winemakers shied away from: a 50-50 partnership.
</P>
<P>
   Vintners consider their business more art than science, and the
field is thickly populated with headstrong entrepreneurs and family
scions. In such an environment, partnerships where neither side has
the final say might appear doomed to deadlock and collapse.
</P>
<P>
   But Michael Mondavi, president and chief executive of Mondavi,
says the only impasse in the Sena venture was a minor one, just
before the New York debut: Mondavi wanted a blue label on the
bottles, while Eduardo Chadwick, head of the prominent Chilean
winemaking family that owns Errazuriz, preferred red.
</P>
<P>
   ``If either of the two partners had full authority over the
design, the decision would have taken half the time,'' Mondavi
said. ``But in the end, I feel it has a positive effect on
business.'' (Then again, he prevailed; they went with blue.)
</P>
<P>
   Mondavi's successful equal partnerships have helped propel an
industry trend. In the last few months, Chateau Mouton-Rothschild
of France and Concha y Toro of Chile announced a 50-50 joint
venture called Almaviva; Chateau Ste. Michelle, a winery in
Washington State, and Antinori of Italy formed one called Col
Solare. California's Wente Vineyards has similar ventures with
winemakers from Mexico, India and Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Mondavi's first equal partnership began two decades ago, and it
long remained one of a kind. Mondavi's father, Robert, was
approached by Baron Philippe de Rothschild several times in the
1970s about producing a California wine together, so the two
``could finally agree on what was a great wine,'' the younger
Mondavi recounted. Begun in 1978, the venture proceeded slowly but
eventually yielded a celebrated wine, Opus One, that fetches $100 a
bottle and sells out rapidly each year.
</P>
<P>
   His father treated Opus as a singular labor of friendship, but
Michael Mondavi saw it as a prototype for globalizing the company.
As he took over Mondavi's reins in the early 1990s, he started
similar ventures with the Frescobaldi family of Italy and the
Chadwicks in Chile.
</P>
<P>
   The six products from the three joint ventures account for only
3.5 percent of Mondavi's $325 million in sales, but they are
central to its plans to sell more wine overseas. Mondavi now
exports 9 percent of its output, high by American standards but far
below the 80 percent figure for the Frescobaldi wineries.
</P>
<P>
   The 50-50 nature of Opus was born in the rapport between two
patriarchs, but Mondavi said its practical advantages over majority
ownership by his winery soon became clear: the accounting is
simpler, and so are the local politics of land use and permits in
countries where Americans can be seen as interlopers.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, partners tend to contribute resources more
unstintingly when they do not feel ``junior,'' Mondavi said. By
teaming up with partners who know the local soil, climate and
people, ``we are able to jump-start the process,'' he said. ``We
produce a better wine in less time and for a lower initial
investment'' than Mondavi could on its own.
</P>
<P>
   He cited the Italian venture, Luce. Charged with creating a wine
to appeal to both American and Italian tastes, the two winemakers _
Mondavi's brother Tim and Lamberto Frescobaldi, whose father,
Vittorio, is president of Marchesi de'Frescobaldi _ tried a
so-called super-Tuscan, a sangiovese-cabernet blend. But they
struggled to produce anything mutually satisfactory until Tim had
the idea of adding merlot grapes from a nearby Frescobaldi
vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Lamberto made that wine alone, he would never have
considered merlot,'' Michael Mondavi said. ``If we went there
alone, we wouldn't have had those grapes available to us. This is
the beauty of a 50-50.''
</P>
<P>
   Similar dynamics propel newer ventures by other wineries.
Antinori, for example, may want access to super-premium grapes
grown outside Italy because of shortages at home, while its
American partner, Chateau Ste. Michelle, says the venture helps it
move into a higher-priced market segment.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is convinced of the merits of 50-50 arrangements.
``We've done 50-50 domestically,'' said Phil Woodward, chairman of
Chalone Wine Group of Napa, Calif., ``and though there are
advantages to this kind of partnership, one of the two partners
clearly has to be the final decision maker.''
</P>
<P>
   And Lewis Perdue, editor of Wine Investment News, likened the
ventures, most of which garner headlines in the wine press but
involve small volumes of wine, to publicity stunts. ``These kinds
of partnerships are less of a trend and more of a PR stink that may
get clobbered by the coming global wine glut,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Mondavi is sold on the idea and is open to more
opportunities, perhaps in France, Hungary or even China. ``Anything
is possible,'' Mondavi said.

SURVEY SHOWS HIGHER USE OF DRUGS AMONG BORDER STUDENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAIME CASTILLO  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Secondary school students along the Texas-Mexico
border are more likely to have tried cocaine than their peers in
the rest of the state, according to statewide survey.
</P>
<P>
   Cocaine use among all Texas secondary school students increased
by 40 percent between 1988 and 1998, the Texas Commission on
Alcohol and Drug Abuse said this week.
</P>
<P>
   The findings were based on a survey of more than 150,000
students statewide in grades seven through 12. There was no
breakdown available of district-by-district results.
</P>
<P>
   One researchers called the findings ``outrageous'' and said the
spike in cocaine usage can be traced to a combination of the drug's
widespread availability and the strong attention law enforcement
agencies have given crack cocaine, a highly potent and addictive
form of cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were so concerned about crack, we kind of lost sight of
powder cocaine,'' said Jane Maxwell, chief researcher for the
commission.
</P>
<P>
   Among 60,000 students surveyed in school districts along the
border, 13.8 percent reported using cocaine at least once, while
nearly 6 percent reported using the illicit drug during the
preceding month.
</P>
<P>
   In other areas of the state, 9.3 percent of students reported
using cocaine once, and 3.5 percent admitted using cocaine in the
preceding 30 days.

   ``This is outrageous,'' Maxwell said. ``We shouldn't have to see
one in 10, or one in eight, of our children using cocaine.''
</P>
<P>
   Although cocaine usage is higher along the border, Maxwell said,
the trend doesn't hold true for other drugs. For example, students
in other areas of the state reported greater use of marijuana and
hallucinogens, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We shouldn't paint the border as a drug haven,'' Maxwell said.
``The truth is that there are things in the Hispanic culture that
we should be trying to duplicate all over the state. There is some
real strength in that culture that helps kids stay away from
drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Maxwell said Hispanic children are more likely to come from
two-parent households and many times are surrounded by various
members of the extended family as well.

BABY, IT'S COLD INSIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sun., July 11)  
(jt) 
 By ALISA TANG    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Who in the Northeast or Midwest, sweltering through the record
heat early last week, didn't daydream about being Iceman?
</P>
<P>
   That Marvel Comics mutant superhero, who can encase himself in
ice and shoot ice from his fingertips, was surely on the mind of
Bill Rosemann, associate manager of promotions and advertising for
Marvel Enterprises in New York. ``I've been walking on the hot
asphalt of this baked Apple,'' he said, ``and I wonder, wouldn't it
be nice to be encased in ice and ride an ice subway to work?''
</P>
<P>
   A daydream for many is a frigid reality for a few: Even when it
is 102 degrees outside, some people actually spend their workdays
shivering.
</P>
<P>
   In the Fairway Market at 133d Street and 12th Avenue in
Manhattan, the meat department is in a room kept at 36 degrees
year-round; black coats hang on the wall for customers' use while
inside. ``When it's cold out, customers shop more quickly,'' said
Ray Venezia, meat manager for the Fairway Operating Corp.'s two
stores. ``Now, they have a more leisurely attitude toward
shopping.''
</P>
<P>
   Visitors were also dawdling last week around the penguin exhibit
at the Central Park Zoo, where the birds enjoy a constant 34
degrees. Though workers who maintain the exhibit might have been
tempted to dawdle, too, they were fully employed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Summer is the busiest time of the year with the penguin
chicks,'' said Rob Gramzay, a senior wild-animal keeper who works
in the polar bird building with the penguins and puffins. ``In the
winter the exhibit is still 34 degrees, and we don't get to warm up
like in the summer.''
</P>
<P>
   Workers at New England Ice Cream in Brockton, Mass., face truly
Arctic conditions: It's 20 below in the warehouse. George Kapotas,
the distribution manager, said that even though ``this time of year
it's the perfect place to be,'' he limits workers to 20 minutes
inside at a time, because of the danger of frostbite and
hypothermia, even when using protective gear.
</P>
<P>
   Fans of ``Late Show with David Letterman,'' many of whom wear
shorts to survive the blazing heat as they stand in line for
tickets, complain about the low-60s cold inside the Ed Sullivan
Theater in Manhattan, where the show is taped.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Mendez, the ``Late Night'' cue card guy, said the chilly
air keeps the crowd peppy. ``If it's warmer, the audience gets
sleepy,'' he said. `` `It keeps the jokes fresh' is what Dave
says.''
</P>
<P>
   Is there a down side to a frigid workplace in a heat wave? Foggy
eyeglasses when leaving work, Mendez said. ``I heard that if you
walk out the door backward, you look like a fool, but your glasses
won't fog up,'' he said. ``I haven't tried it yet.''

KAZAKHSTAN BLOCKS A MISSILE LAUNCHING BY RUSSIA  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALMATY, Kazakhstan _ Three days after a Russian rocket
disintegrated over a grain-growing region of this Central Asian
republic, the government barred Russia from carrying out a
scheduled launching on Thursday from Baikonur Cosmodrome.
</P>
<P>
   After the launching was halted, government officials said they
found toxic fuel from the launching on Monday of a Proton rocket in
Karkaralinsk, 435 miles north of here, where a large piece of the
spacecraft crashed into a shepherd's yard, and other wreckage set
many acres of steppe on fire. No injuries were reported, but the
accident quickly revived long-held local resentment of vast
environmental and health damage, including chronic birth defects,
left behind from decades of nuclear tests and space launchings.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the accident comes at a time of increased bilateral
tension between the two former Soviet neighbors. Since 1994, Moscow
has ostensibly leased Baikonur from Kazakhstan for commercial
launchings and missions to its Mir space station, but it has yet to
pay any of the $115 million annual rent.
</P>
<P>
   Kazakhstan officials said no more launchings will be permitted
until the environmental consequences of Monday's accident are
determined.
</P>
<P>
   Kazakhstan officials said a scientific commission was examining
the environmental consequences of the accident. ``All launches from
Baikonur Cosmodrome will be forbidden until the commission
investigation gives a conclusion to the reason for the
catastrophe,'' said Rasul Jumaliev, a spokesman for the Kazakhstan
Foreign Affairs Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   Independent Kazakhstani political activists on Thursday night
delivered a letter to the Russian Embassy here, blaming Moscow for
the republic's ecological problems, and demanding ``the payment of
all possible expenses for the liquidation of the past
catastrophes.''
</P>
<P>
   In Moscow, Itar-Tass reported that a Russian Foreign Ministry
spokesman, Vladimir Rakhmanin, had apologized for the crash and
agreed that Proton launches should be suspended until the reason
for the crash is known.
</P>
<P>
   Yet other comments from Moscow suggested that Russian officials
were losing patience on the issue. Sergei Gorbunov, a spokesman for
Russia's space agency, dismissed Kazakhstan's ban on all launches
as ``an emotional outburst,'' adding that ``the accident was not an
ecological catastrophe, the population did not suffer. It is not a
technical problem, but a political decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Russian officials tested Kazakhstan's resolve by
proceeding with preparations for Thursday's scheduled launch -- a
Ukrainian exploratory satellite aboard a Zenith booster -- almost
until its midday launch time and the word that the ban would indeed
be enforced.
</P>
<P>
   But Russian officials hope to proceed Friday or Monday with the
launching that had been scheduled for Thursday, and to send up a
computerized navigation system to Mir on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow considers the Mir mission particularly vital because its
last crew will conclude its mission next month, and the new
navigation system will prevent the unmanned spacecraft from
hurtling to Earth before Moscow can raise the money to send up a
fresh mission.
</P>
<P>
   Rakhmanin appealed for Kazakhstan to lift the ban for spacecraft
not using the Proton-K heavy booster rocket ``so as not to disrupt
both bilateral and international commitments relying on the use of
the Baikonur Cosmodrome.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Kazakhstan obtained yet another promise from Russia:
to finally begin paying rent on Baikonur this month; the current
dispute could be used as a lever to initiate the much-needed cash
flow.
</P>
<P>
   The accident could be a setback for the Proton, Russia's
workhorse booster and the spearhead of an effort, with Lockheed
Martin Corp., to commercialize Russia's space industry in the face
of failure in virtually every other part of its economy. The
Proton's last crash was in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   In November, the Proton is scheduled to launch a Russian-made
living quarters for the $60-billion International Space Station, a
joint venture of 16 nations including the United States.

HIGH-DEFINITION MONITOR COMBINES CAPABILITIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID BLOOM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ I recently headed down Interstate 405 to Orange
County to check out a couple of new products. My first stop was at
monitor manufacturer Princeton to see the new high-definition TV
monitor it is putting on the market.
</P>
<P>
   Princeton, which makes the monitors for Gateway Computer's
Destination series of big-screen TV/computer systems, also has
outfitted its AF3.OHD high-def monitor with the connectors that
allow it to carry your PC's VGA, SVGA or XGA video signals.
</P>
<P>
   Because it's a monitor, you'd need to spend around $1,500 to get
the digital TV tuner needed to pull down over-the-air broadcasts
from local TV stations (which looked really great on my visit).
</P>
<P>
   But here's an even better solution, says Princeton's Phil
Callahan, who directs the company's convergence and HDTV products:
use a PC, with a $1,000 pair of digital TV tuner cards inside, to
control the nifty set. And if that computer also has a DVD-ROM
drive inside, you can (in addition to being able to surf the Net,
play computer games on a huge screen and watch amazing television
with great surround sound) watch pristine versions of more and more
movies and other cool stuff on DVD.
</P>
<P>
   I won't bore you with lots of specification talk, but the
company has loaded up the machine with a ton of technological
goodies that spec hounds will love, thanks to design input from Joe
Kane, the digital TV guru who authored ``Video Essentials for
DVD.''
</P>
<P>
   The 32-inch monitor sells for $4,100, which is a lot of money,
but not so much when you realize the only other high-def TV like it
comes from Sony at about double the cost. For more information, go
to www.princetongraphics.com. &QL;

DEVIL IN THE DETAILS
</P>
<P>
   Blizzard, based in Irvine, Calif., and a part of the group of
gaming companies that Havas Interactive recently acquired from
Cendant, has a catalog of smash hits that includes WarCraft,
WarCraft 2, Diablo and last year's million-selling sales leader,
StarCraft.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it looks like the company has another winner. Of course, it
helps that Blizzard is building a sequel to the much-loved Diablo,
the huge-selling 2-D adventure game set in a forebodingly medieval
world.
</P>
<P>
   Though it's still a ways from done, Diablo II looks even better
than its handsomely wrought predecessor. Many interface elements
remain from the first game, but designers have shrunk the screen
space devoted to its controls. They've also made it easier to
control your character's movements, varied the way they look with
different kinds of armor and weaponry, and made it easier to build
up a character's skills and magic spells and to find discarded
booty.
</P>
<P>
   They've replaced the original Diablo's character types with five
new ones: the amazon, the sorceress, the necromancer, the paladin
and the barbarian. The old characters still appear in the game as
non-player characters who can be recruited as allies in various
miniquests that are part of the game's flow.
</P>
<P>
   The new game requires four discs to hold the four sprawling
``acts'' in the game, and it generates new terrain and monsters
each time you play a level.They've also doubled, to eight, the
number of players who can fight over Blizzard's great Battle.net
online gaming center. If you want a peek, surf over to
www.blizzard.com. &QL;

DRIVEN CRAZY
</P>
<P>
   Having just survived the holiday weekend's driving adventures,
here's a place to find out what intersections to avoid on Labor Day
_ and the rest of the year, for that matter.
</P>
<P>
   FasTV, which accretes a ton of video from a wide range of news
and other sources and cuts it into bite-size, annotated chunks for
easy Web viewing, is now running highlights from State Farm
Insurance's series on the 10 most dangerous intersections in
America.
</P>
<P>
   There are intersections from California and five other states,
culled from the insurance company's statistics on auto accidents.
For a look at where not to drive, go to www.FasTV.com
</P>
<P>
   FasTV, by the way, is one of a number of sites now putting lots
of video on the Net, everything from movie trailers to music
performances to news broadcasts. Generally, the companies are
betting increasing numbers of high-speed connections will make
viewing video a more enjoyable experience.
</P>
<P>
   Disney's Go Network, for instance, has a music-oriented site
called Wall of Sound (at www.wallofsound.go.com) that just cut a
deal to run music videos provided by Entertainment Boulevard (at
www.entertainmentblvd.com). Many of the videos aren't available
through the usual sources, such as MTV, VH1 or BET, so it should be
a welcome addition for music fans.
</P>
<P>
   And for those who like acquiring their music videos the semi
old-fashioned way, Facets Multimedia in Chicago has a catalog of
more than 1,000 videotapes, laser discs and DVDs from a wide range
of genres.
</P>
<P>
   For more information, e-mail the company at salesfacets.org or
call (800) 331-6197. The catalog is free. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
READY FREDDY?
</P>
<P>
   I'm not quite sure our world needs this, but New Line Home Video
is offering a boxed set of DVDs of all seven of its ``Nightmare on
Elm Street'' movies to celebrate the 15th anniversary of the
durable horror franchise's debut.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is the DVDs are loaded with tons of extras for
those who can't quite get enough Freddie Krueger. The series was
influential, helping create the modern slasher genre, finance New
Line's creation, and kickstart the careers of such notables as
Laurence Fishburne, Johnny Depp and Patricia Arquette.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news: It's still Freddy slashing teens in their dreams
for seven bloody discs.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, New Line does it right. The DVDs include interviews
with all seven movies' directors and actors as well as other horror
directors and fans. Win a series of trivia games on the discs, and
you'll be entered in a random drawing for merchandise and other
DVDs. There's also an encyclopedia and a documentary about the
series and a 3-D sequence complete with viewing glasses.
</P>
<P>
   If you're watching this stuff on your PC, you'll be able to
watch the film as the screenplay scrolls by, read up-to-date cast
and crew bios, and link to the official Web site (to be launched
this summer at www.NightmareOnElmStreet.com.
</P>
<P>
   It'll cost you about $130 for this embarrassment of, um, riches.
You can also buy the movies individually, and on VHS video, though
most of the extra goodies aren't available on tape. I hear some
people would kill to own this collection. Or to make me stop making
bad jokes.

 By JANE WOLFE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If, like Florida's first lady, you have been known to skirt the
rules when bringing back merchandise from abroad, you may want to
mend your ways.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Customs Service estimates that each year, hundreds of
thousands of travelers break the rules, often saying either that
they forgot to pay duties or that they didn't know about them. But
Customs is making it more difficult to use ignorance as an excuse
for cheating.
</P>
<P>
   Airline passengers are about to be hit with a barrage of
warnings about Customs rules and the penalties for breaking them.
Signs and kiosks will greet travelers at the airport; Customs
employees will approach some of them in international departure
lounges to talk about the rules.
</P>
<P>
   Penalties can be as much as eight times the amount of duty that
should have been paid, and the merchandise is sometimes
confiscated. In some cases, the violation can be a criminal
offense.
</P>
<P>
   Publicity about the $4,100 civil fine recently paid by Columba
Bush, the wife of Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida, after she failed to
declare all the clothes and jewelry she brought home from a Paris
shopping spree has caught the attention of travelers everywhere.
Mrs. Bush paid fines that amounted to about three times the duty
she would have paid on the items, which cost her $19,000 and had a
domestic value of $25,000. The cost to her husband _ in reputation
and future votes _ is harder to tally.
</P>
<P>
   Customs officials say that while stories like Mrs. Bush's will
make people think twice about improper declarations, amateur
smugglers have become emboldened in recent years because fewer
people are searched than in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Before 1980, inspectors questioned every passenger and usually
searched bags. In 1975, Betsy Bloomingdale _ wife of Alfred
Bloomingdale, an heir to the New York department store fortune _
was caught failing to report full value of two Christian Dior
dresses. Because duties are intended to protect stores and
manufacturers against foreign competition, that was big news.
</P>
<P>
   The enormous increase in international travelers, though, has
made such comprehensive searching impossible. Some 71 million
passengers cleared customs last year, almost four times the 18
million in 1980, while the number of Customs employees held steady
at 20,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``People aren't used to being questioned, so they wonder, `Why
me?''' said Susan Mitchell, assistant Customs director for
passenger operations at Kennedy International Airport in New York.
</P>
<P>
   A traveler pulled aside for more than cursory questioning may be
suspected of breaking the law or may just have been the unlucky
person at the front of the line when a selection timer sounded.
</P>
<P>
   At Kennedy Airport between October 1998 and May 1999, $330,000
in penalties were paid on $2.1 million in improperly declared
merchandise brought in by 460 travelers.
</P>
<P>
   Passengers are allowed to bring in $400 in merchandise
duty-free. A 10 percent duty is levied on the next $1,000, and
further duties at various levels, depending on the items. If
travelers bring in a substantial amount of merchandise they intend
to sell, a violation can even mean jail time.
</P>
<P>
   Passengers caught failing to declare items or underestimating
their value usually end up paying between two and eight times the
duty. But even when they are caught, violators might not be fined
if they cooperate with inspectors, said Don Simpson a Customs
supervisor at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``You should say, `I'm sorry,' and you should not withhold
information,'' he said. ``If there's an invoice we want, show it to
us. More than likely we'll find it anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, thousands of people each year try to outwit Customs
officials. And even when inspectors who suspect lawbreaking give
people a last chance to amend their declarations, many choose not
to.
</P>
<P>
   Inspectors go to school to learn how to spot smugglers. Nervous
hands and averted eyes are easy first clues. ``We don't do
profiling, but we target based on certain countries,'' Ms. Mitchell
said. ``Every flight has its own threat. Flights from Paris have
the fashion goods threat.''
</P>
<P>
   Anne Marie Spiess, the Customs director for passenger operations
at Dallas-Fort Worth, knows the usual ploys. ``Jewelry is usually
hidden on the person or worn out in the open, and the inspector may
be hard-pressed to prove the person bought it on the trip,'' she
said. ``If we believe this person is smuggling, we can detain the
item and have them prove it was purchased previously.''
</P>
<P>
   Suitcase linings and toiletry bags are popular hiding places.
``People think we don't want to go digging in the toiletry bag
because it's all mushy in there, but they're wrong,'' Ms. Spiess
said.
</P>
<P>
   Removing clothing labels is an old trick, but inspectors often
find receipts. And bands removed from Cuban cigars, which are
normally not permitted to enter this country, are often found
hidden elsewhere. The items that are most often declared improperly

A NIGHT OUT WITH MARLON RICHARDS: THRIFTY, WITH A PEDIGREE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, July 11)  
 (bl)  
 By DANA DICKEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ AT 9 p.m. Monday, the temperature sign on Manhattan
Mini Storage on Varick Street read 103 degrees. A few blocks west,
inside a gritty club called Don Hill's, Marlon Richards tucked in
his billowy white shirt to neaten up for a party celebrating the
first issue of Cheap Date, a magazine about punk rock and
thrift-store shopping produced largely by children of upper-crust
families.
</P>
<P>
   There would be no open bar this night, but also no cover charge,
in keeping with Cheap Date's editorial creed: ``Living with less
with style.''
</P>
<P>
   Richards, 27, the son of Keith Richards of the Rolling Stones,
is art director of the magazine. The editor is Bay Garnett, 26, a
daughter of Andy Garnett, a member of the English aristocracy.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, Richards' wife, Lucie de la Falaise, the daughter of
Loulou de la Falaise, the longtime Yves Saint Laurent muse,
arrived. ``I asked Marlon, `Do we have to dress cheap?''' Ms. de la
Falaise said. ``He said no.'' She wore a pretty party dress with
narrow straps.
</P>
<P>
   Richards and Ms. Garnett handed guests the canary-covered,
42-page quarterly and a matching T-shirt. The magazine, really more
of a zine, has articles like ``Give Me Barneys Any Day,'' about a
reluctant convert to thrift shopping, and a column by filmmaker
Harmony Korine in which he imagines the provenance of thrift-store
clothing.
</P>
<P>
   Richards gave a warm bearhug to Rafael de Rothschild of the
banking family, who arrived with model Karen Elson. Her sheer,
brown, flowered dress came from a London thrift store, Virginia.
``We're the two most in-love people in the world,'' she said,
kissing Rothschild. Ms. Elson is featured in Cheap Date in a mock
beauty pageant picture spread.
</P>
<P>
   As the crowd danced and otherwise sucked the chill from the
room, Richards stood with Alex Friedman, 27, a son of Boston
property developer Richard Friedman, who has loaned his Martha's
Vineyard compound to the Clintons for summertime visits. Alex
Friedman, who wrote an article for Cheap Date about a bartender who
coveted a thrift-store coat, had invited Richards and Ms. de la
Falaise to the family house the following day.
</P>
<P>
   Another contributor, Iris Palmer, a model and the daughter of
Sir Mark Palmer, said, ``I think it's insulting to charge a lot for
clothes.'' She pulled out the nondesigner label of her white coat
dress. ``It's all consumerism, isn't it?'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Near midnight, Richards was alone in a corner, enrapt in a video
car-racing game called Super Battle. He moved to the bar, and soon
was talking to Amber Valletta, the covergirl, who had her blond
hair fluffed to resemble a 1970s Farrah Fawcett. ``You should ask
me to contribute something for the next issue,'' Ms. Valletta told
him ``I could write something.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, that'd be great,'' Richards said.
</P>
<P>
   Nigel Mogg, a bassist formerly with Nancy Boy, who contributed
an article on rock bands with big hair, pondered the appeal of
penny pinching to the children of wealthy, often titled parents.
``It's like a rich slacker thing,'' said Mogg, who is from a modest
North London family. ``But they're my friends, so I can't go too
deep into it because it will sound insulting.'' He laughed. ``But
Marlon has done a good thing.''

DIANA KRALL, BOWL JAZZ ORCHESTRA MAKE MUSIC TOGETHER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROB LOWMAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Most of the people who showed up at the Hollywood
Bowl on Wednesday night were there to see jazz diva Diana Krall,
but they were also treated to a delightful set from the
Clayton-Hamilton Jazz Orchestra and some fun collaborations.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's event was the first of eight jazz nights at the
Bowl, which will feature the orchestra. Also making its bow was a
new set designed especially for CHJO.
</P>
<P>
   But first Krall, who didn't disappoint. With a hit new album,
``When I Look Into Your Eyes,'' and her glamourous image popping up
in numerous magazines _ the pianist-singer may have a lot to live
up to these days. But Krall's talent is undeniable. It would be
easy to nitpick her vocal stylings or piano playing, but that's
what it would be _ nitpicking.
</P>
<P>
   She first came on at the end of CHJO's set to sing three songs.
Dressed in a light blue satin pants ensemble with a long white
jacket, she kicked off with ``East of the Sun.'' The first thing
you notice is that after years hunkered down at a piano fronting
her own trio, Krall isn't quite comfortable just standing behind a
microphone. She isn't stiff _ she taps her foot and moves her arms
_ but her body language doesn't match her smooth, sultry vocals.
Nevertheless, it isn't enough to detract from the music. It's those
lovely, smart interpretations of pop standards that has made Krall
such a draw.
</P>
<P>
   Coming out in the second half with her quartet _ Krall on piano,
plus guitar, bass and drums (added for this tour) _ she seemed much
more in her element. The piano almost became part of her as her
fingers flew over the keys, which was a remarkable contrast to
those seemingly effortless vocals.
</P>
<P>
   But there is nothing effortless about Krall's vocal. It's an
illusion. Like Astaire when he was dancing, she never shows the
sweat. Take the Cole Porter classic ``I've Got You Under My Skin,''
a song done countless times by the best in the business, including
Frank Sinatra, who Krall cited. Yet Krall manages to give it a
fresh reading, avoiding the obvious dynamics and cliched phrasing
that most vocalists use, instead getting under your skin (in a
pleasurable way) as she seductively lingers over the notes.
</P>
<P>
   Krall showed her fun side with ``Peel Me a Grape,'' and the
audience clearly enjoyed her understated Mae West-ish growl as she
reeled off a command: ``When I say do it/ jump to it.'' It was also
clear that Krall enjoyed the interworkings of the small combo,
whose members all took extended solos on such tunes as a driving
rendition of the late Bobby Troupe's ``Route 66.'' Later, the CHJO
returned and her superb piano work shone with the instrumental
``Krall in the Groove.''
</P>
<P>
   She ended the evening standing behind the mike again, singing
``I Can't Give You Anything but Love'' with the CHJO providing a
big-band sound behind her. As her career grows, Krall is likely to
be doing more of this. And while she may not be at ease in such
situations, she knows how to sell a song the way it counts _
musically.
</P>
<P>
   The evening opened with the CHJO doing a few numbers. The
orchestra is the backbone of the Bowl's summer jazz series, and
L.A. should be thankful. Under the direction of John Clayton, the
CHJO gives its music an edge without pushing it over. The
arrangements are witty and subtle, and the 18-piece orchestra is
made up of terrific instrumentalists. The Bowl will be in good
hands this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Oh yeah, that new set for the orchestra. Not bad, but not as
good as the music. &QL;

TOYOTA MAKES BIG PUSH INTO FULL-SIZE U.S. TRUCK MARKET
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By G. CHAMBERS WILLIAMS III 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Toyota has launched the first import-brand attack on the U.S.
full-size truck market.
</P>
<P>
   The 2000 Toyota Tundra, designed to compete against the Ford
F-150, Chevrolet Silverado/GMC Sierra and Dodge Ram, went on sale
in late May, accompanied by a $40 million advertising blitz that
bills the new truck as the ``best in class.''
</P>
<P>
   With its optional 4.7-liter, 32-valve V-8 engine rated at 245
horsepower and 315 foot-pounds of torque, the Tundra is the first
import-brand truck to match at least the mid-range power of the
full-size U.S. pickups.
</P>
<P>
   The Tundra is designed and built for the U.S. market, and to
avoid the 25 percent federal tax on imported trucks, Toyota is
assembling these vehicles at a new plant near Princeton, Ind.
</P>
<P>
   Ford, whose F-series has been the best-selling vehicle in North
America for several years, can relax for now, though. Toyota isn't
going to unseat the F-series anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the Tundra sells out, plant capacity is only 100,000
trucks a year. Ford sells upwards of 600,000 F-series trucks each
year. Toyota expects to sell just one-tenth as many Tundras this
model year.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the arrival of the Tundra brings the Japanese auto
industry into a market it has never broached. With the industry's
reputation for quality and perfection, Toyota is going to be a
force to be reckoned with, even in this U.S.-manufacturer-dominated
market segment.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Toyota officials believe that Tundra sales will come
primarily from traditional buyers of smaller Japanese trucks, such
as the compact Toyota Tacoma, who want to move up to a bigger and
faster machine. Another expected market is first-time pickup buyers
who prefer import products.
</P>
<P>
   Cracking the Ford/GM/Dodge full-size monopoly will be tough,
primarily because current owners of these trucks are loyal
customers and are passionate about their pickups.
</P>
<P>
   Toyota must prove itself as a capable truck builder to win over
buyers from Ford and General Motors, much in the same way Dodge has
been doing since the introduction of the current Ram model in the
mid-90s.
</P>
<P>
   Dodge made a name for itself with the radical new styling of the
Ram, along with its optional, powerful V-8 and V-10 engines.
</P>
<P>
   Toyota will make a name for itself in the full-size truck market
through a combination of attributes found in the new Tundra:
pleasing, if not radical, styling; excellent performance from
either the base V-6 or optional V-8 engine; its carlike ride and
handling; and a combination of quality, durability and ruggedness.
</P>
<P>
   The Tundra comes in two- and four-wheel-drive models with either
a regular two-door cab (with no back seat) or the Access Cab model,
with four doors and a back seat that is roomy enough for three
adults. Regular-cab models have an eight-foot bed. The Access Cab's
bed is six-and-a-half-feet long. There are three trim levels: the
base Tundra, midlevel SR5 and high-end Limited.
</P>
<P>
   We tested the four-wheel-drive, V-8, SR5 Access Cab model (base
price $25,585 plus $447 transportation), which came with a list of
options that ran the pricetag up to $29,336. With all that was
included in this price, the Tundra competes head-to-head with the
competition.
</P>
<P>
   The all-new V-8 engine, based on the engine used in the upscale
Lexus LS 400, is the heart of this vehicle. Along with one of the
smoothest-shifting four-speed automatic transmissions on the
market, this powerplant gives the Tundra a sports car feel. Punch
the gas and this vehicle takes off, and it doesn't seem anything
like a truck. That kind of zip was lacking in Toyota's T-100
pickup, a V-6, midsize model that just didn't catch on with U.S.
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The four-wheel drive is a shift-on-the-fly system engaged by
pushbutton on the dash. There is a separate button to put the
transmission into low range for serious off-roading.
</P>
<P>
   The Tundra cab is as quiet as that of a Camry sedan, a real
accomplishment for a full-size pickup. Stepping up into the cab was
easy with the chrome-tube-based step-board on each side (a $399
dealer accessory).
</P>
<P>
   The rear doors swing out to the rear, and provide a wide opening
to the back seat. And unlike the competition, the Tundra's rear
doors have handles outside and inside like a normal door, rather
than in the door jamb.
</P>
<P>
   The V-8 engine provides enough power for a 2,000-pound payload
and for towing a trailer of up to 7,500 pounds _ also a first for
an import-brand truck.
</P>
<P>
   The base V-6 engine is a 3.4-liter, 24-valve powerplant rated at
190 horsepower and 220 foot-pounds of torque _ comparable to the
V-6 in the Ram, but slightly less powerful than the base
six-cylinder engines in the F-series and GM pickups. Still, many
buyers will choose the V-6 and find it more than adequate for their
needs.
</P>
<P>
   Standard safety features include dual front air bags (with
passenger bag cut-off switch), head rests and three-point seatbelts
in the outboard positions, an energy-absorbing steering column and
side-impact door beams. Four-wheel antilock brakes are optional,
and were not included on our test vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   A front bench seat is standard, but our vehicle came with dual
front captain's chairs ($75). A two-level center console had a
storage compartment and two large cup holders suitable for a Big
Gulp on the lower level. A pair of smaller cup holders pops out of
the dashboard in all Tundras.
</P>
<P>
   Other standard equipment includes air-conditioning, chrome
bumpers and mirrors, locking tailgate and fuel door, tilt steering
wheel, cruise control, dual power outlets plus lighter in the lower
dash, cut-pile carpeting and an AM/FM/cassette stereo with six
speakers.
</P>
<P>
   A convenience package on our vehicle ($2,050) added power
windows and door locks, sliding rear window and more. Other options
included 16-inch aluminum-alloy wheels ($630), an upgrade to a
cassette/compact-disc audio system ($100), fog lamps ($130), and a
dealer-added ``Extra Mile'' options package ($1,190) that tacked on
carpeted floor mats and custom pinstriping, among other things.
</P>
<P>
   EPA fuel-economy ratings are 14 miles per gallon in the city and
17 mpg on the highway. The tank holds 26.4 gallons of fuel.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   At A Glance:
</P>
<P>
   2000 Toyota Tundra SR5 Access Cab 4X4 pickup
</P>
<P>
   THE PACKAGE: Full-size, four-door, five- or six-passenger, V-6
or V-8 powered, four-wheel-drive pickup, an all-new model.
</P>
<P>
   HIGHLIGHTS: Toyota becomes the first import brand with a
full-size pickup for the U.S. market. With its 245-horsepower V-8
engine and beautiful styling, this truck is ready to take on the
big Ford, Chevy/GMC and Dodge pickups. Ride and handling are
carlike, power is awesome with the V-8, and quality and
dependability will be hallmarks of the Tundra.
</P>
<P>
   NEGATIVES: No complaints.
</P>
<P>
   MAJOR COMPETITORS: Ford F-150, Chevrolet Silverado/GMC Sierra,
Dodge Ram.
</P>
<P>
   EPA FUEL ECONOMY: 14 miles per gallon city, 17 highway.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It's still early in the 2000 election race, but
already Texas Gov. George W. Bush and Vice President Al Gore are
slugging it out over an increasingly important constituency:
Hispanic voters.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, the Republican frontrunner, made courtship of Latinos a
top priority during his visit to San Diego late last month, saying
he had won support from Hispanics in Texas and ``I intend to do
(that) here in the state of California as well.''
</P>
<P>
   A Texan who is at home with Hispanic language and culture, Bush
laces his speeches with Spanish phrases and does interviews on
Hispanic television in Spanish. By contrast, Gore, the Democratic
frontrunner, offers some Spanish sentences in his speeches but is
not as fluent as Bush in the language.
</P>
<P>
   Sensing sudden vulnerability in a reliable segment of their
voting bloc, Democrats are launching a salvo of their own. A
three-page press release put out by the Democratic National
Committee highlights what it calls ``Bush's anti-Hispanic record.''
</P>
<P>
   Democratic National Chairman Roy Romer acknowledged in an
interview last week that Bush ``has support from the Hispanic
community greater than most Republicans have.'' But he added,
``This early in the campaign, people like excitement and new
personalities, but you've got to know what you're buying. There
might be new wrapping, but the content is the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Citing Bush's opposition to affirmative action and statistical
sampling, a technique that would supplement actual head-counting in
the census, Romer said, ``When (Hispanic voters) get to know him
and contrast his record with the Democrats' (record), his
popularity will drop.'' Romer and other sampling proponents say use
of the technique would avoid the traditional undercount of poor
people including Hispanics and African Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has won the endorsement of black entrepreneur Ward
Connerly, a University of California regent and the guiding force
behind Proposition 209, the 1996 voter-approved initiative that
barred the state from considering gender or race in contracts,
hiring or public university admissions.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has said he believes in ``the spirit of no quotas and no
preferences.'' But his supporters point out that in five years as
governor, he has backed creative alternatives to affirmative
action. For instance, after federal courts banned race-conscious
admissions to the University of Texas, Bush supported legislation
to boost minority enrollment by giving automatic admission to the
top 10 percent of graduates from every Texas high school.
</P>
<P>
   On statistical sampling, Bush, like most Republicans, argues
there is no substitute for the actual counting of the population, a
position the U.S. Supreme Court upheld earlier this year. ``Gov.
Bush believes we should count every person and if cities think
they've been undercounted, we should keep counting until we get it
right,'' said Bush campaign spokesman Mindy Tucker.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Gore has backed sampling and the administration's
policy of ``mend it but don't end it'' regarding affirmative
action. Gore contends the administration's economic policies have
helped boost Hispanic family income and notes that Clinton has
appointed more Hispanics to high office than any other president,
particularly his Republican predecessors, George Bush and Ronald
Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   By one estimate, 8 percent of Clinton's appointees have been
Hispanic, compared with 5 percent for Bush and 2 percent for
Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also has touted the administration's $547 million
``Hispanic education action plan'' to enhance the teaching of
English, improve reading skills and keep high school students from
dropping out. He also talks about his appreciation if Hispanic
culture dating to his high school days when he spent a summer in
Mexico learning Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   The other Democratic contender, former New Jersey Sen. Bill
Bradley, has tried to appeal to Hispanics in a more indirect
fashion, talking about his commitment to the party's traditional
agenda of civil rights and fighting poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Gore and Bradley spoke at the Unity '99 conference of
minority journalists in Seattle. Bush, however, showed up at the
convention for a 15-minute walk-though but without a speech. He
abruptly changed his schedule to make the appearance after reading
a news item saying that reporters attending the convention had
criticized him for snubbing their invitation even though he was in
the city campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Bush proved to be popular among Hispanics in his
reelection bid. Voter News Service exit polls showed he won 49
percent of their votes, but the San Antonio-based William Velasquez
Institute, a Hispanic interest group, put the figure at 39 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Bush supporters say they aren't worried about Democratic attacks
on him. Rep. Henry Bonilla, R-Texas notes that Bush has gone to
great lengths to distance himself from the harsh anti-immigrant
tone of former California Republican Gov. Pete Wilson, which
alienated Hispanic voters in that state. Wilson was the moving
force behind Proposition 187, a 1994 ballot initiative approved by
California voters that barred illegal immigrants from obtaining
most public services including enrollment in public schools. The
measure is stalled in the courts and has never been enforced.
</P>
<P>
   State Assembly Speaker Antonio Villaraigosa said in an interview
that Hispanics still are suspicious of the GOP because of that
measure and Proposition 209. He predicted Bush would get no more
than 25 percent of the state's Hispanic vote. ``He's smooth,
congenial and he can work a crowd, and he won't use inflammatory
rhetoric ... but at the end of the day, he can't run away from the
issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Both parties agree that the Hispanic vote will be crucial in
next year's election.
</P>
<P>
   Hispanics number about 30 million _ 11 percent of the
population, 5 percent of the electorate. Most are of Mexican,
Puerto Rican and Cuban descent.
</P>
<P>
   They are a key constituency in New York, Florida, California and
Texas, states that collectively have 144 electoral votes, 54
percent of the 270 votes needed to win the White House. In
California and Texas alone, which combined have 86 electoral votes,
Hispanics are a quarter of the population.
</P>
<P>
   They make up 14 percent of California's voters and 16 percent of
Texas's voters. Last year 78 percent of California's Hispanics
voted for Democrat Gray Davis for governor. Two years earlier, 72
percent of Hispanics nationally voted for President Clinton's
reelection.
</P>
<P>
   Some political scientists say the challenge for Bush will be to
build on his good relations with Hispanics while not alienating the
more traditional conservative elements of the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   John Garcia, a University of Arizona political scientist, said
that if Bush is the GOP nominee, ``he will be putting himself into
the position of speaking for Republican Party positions that could
make Hispanics uncomfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Bush supports vouchers that would subsidize public
school students who want to attend private schools, a position
opposed by the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC), a
non-partisan Hispanic civil rights organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to keep close watch on Governor Bush,'' said Rick
Dovalina, a Houston lawyer who is president of LULAC. ``He knows
the language and the culture, but that doesn't mean Gore couldn't
do well among Hispanics.''

<P>
   Bush, the Republican frontrunner, made courtship of Latinos a
top priority during his visit to San Diego late last month, saying
he had won support from Hispanics in Texas and ``I intend to do
(that) here in the state of California as well.''
</P>
<P>
   A Texan who is at home with Hispanic language and culture, Bush
laces his speeches with Spanish phrases and does interviews on
Hispanic television in Spanish. By contrast, Gore, the Democratic
frontrunner, offers some Spanish sentences in his speeches but is
not as fluent as Bush in the language.
</P>
<P>
   Sensing sudden vulnerability in a reliable segment of their
voting bloc, Democrats are launching a salvo of their own. A
three-page press release put out by the Democratic National
Committee highlights what it calls ``Bush's anti-Hispanic record.''
</P>
<P>
   Democratic National Chairman Roy Romer acknowledged in an
interview last week that Bush ``has support from the Hispanic
community greater than most Republicans have.'' But he added,
``This early in the campaign, people like excitement and new
personalities, but you've got to know what you're buying. There
might be new wrapping, but the content is the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Citing Bush's opposition to affirmative action and statistical
sampling, a technique that would supplement actual head-counting in
the census, Romer said, ``When (Hispanic voters) get to know him
and contrast his record with the Democrats' (record), his
popularity will drop.'' Romer and other sampling proponents say use
of the technique would avoid the traditional undercount of poor
people including Hispanics and African Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has won the endorsement of black entrepreneur Ward
Connerly, a University of California regent and the guiding force
behind Proposition 209, the 1996 voter-approved initiative that
barred the state from considering gender or race in contracts,
hiring or public university admissions.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has said he believes in ``the spirit of no quotas and no
preferences.'' But his supporters point out that in five years as
governor, he has backed creative alternatives to affirmative
action. For instance, after federal courts banned race-conscious
admissions to the University of Texas, Bush supported legislation
to boost minority enrollment by giving automatic admission to the
top 10 percent of graduates from every Texas high school.
</P>
<P>
   On statistical sampling, Bush, like most Republicans, argues
there is no substitute for the actual counting of the population, a
position the U.S. Supreme Court upheld earlier this year. ``Gov.
Bush believes we should count every person and if cities think
they've been undercounted, we should keep counting until we get it
right,'' said Bush campaign spokesman Mindy Tucker.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Gore has backed sampling and the administration's
policy of ``mend it but don't end it'' regarding affirmative
action. Gore contends the administration's economic policies have
helped boost Hispanic family income and notes that Clinton has
appointed more Hispanics to high office than any other president,
particularly his Republican predecessors, George Bush and Ronald
Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   By one estimate, 8 percent of Clinton's appointees have been
Hispanic, compared with 5 percent for Bush and 2 percent for
Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also has touted the administration's $547 million
``Hispanic education action plan'' to enhance the teaching of
English, improve reading skills and keep high school students from
dropping out. He also talks about his appreciation if Hispanic
culture dating to his high school days when he spent a summer in
Mexico learning Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   The other Democratic contender, former New Jersey Sen. Bill
Bradley, has tried to appeal to Hispanics in a more indirect
fashion, talking about his commitment to the party's traditional
agenda of civil rights and fighting poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Gore and Bradley spoke at the Unity '99 conference of
minority journalists in Seattle. Bush, however, showed up at the
convention for a 15-minute walk-though but without a speech. He
abruptly changed his schedule to make the appearance after reading
a news item saying that reporters attending the convention had
criticized him for snubbing their invitation even though he was in
the city campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Bush proved to be popular among Hispanics in his
reelection bid. Voter News Service exit polls showed he won 49
percent of their votes, but the San Antonio-based William Velasquez
Institute, a Hispanic interest group, put the figure at 39 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Bush supporters say they aren't worried about Democratic attacks
on him. Rep. Henry Bonilla, R-Texas notes that Bush has gone to
great lengths to distance himself from the harsh anti-immigrant
tone of former California Republican Gov. Pete Wilson, which
alienated Hispanic voters in that state. Wilson was the moving
force behind Proposition 187, a 1994 ballot initiative approved by
California voters that barred illegal immigrants from obtaining
most public services including enrollment in public schools. The
measure is stalled in the courts and has never been enforced.
</P>
<P>
   State Assembly Speaker Antonio Villaraigosa said in an interview
that Hispanics still are suspicious of the GOP because of that
measure and Proposition 209. He predicted Bush would get no more
than 25 percent of the state's Hispanic vote. ``He's smooth,
congenial and he can work a crowd, and he won't use inflammatory
rhetoric ... but at the end of the day, he can't run away from the
issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Both parties agree that the Hispanic vote will be crucial in
next year's election.
</P>
<P>
   Hispanics number about 30 million _ 11 percent of the
population, 5 percent of the electorate. Most are of Mexican,
Puerto Rican and Cuban descent.
</P>
<P>
   They are a key constituency in New York, Florida, California and
Texas, states that collectively have 144 electoral votes, 54
percent of the 270 votes needed to win the White House. In
California and Texas alone, which combined have 86 electoral votes,
Hispanics are a quarter of the population.
</P>
<P>
   They make up 14 percent of California's voters and 16 percent of
Texas's voters. Last year 78 percent of California's Hispanics
voted for Democrat Gray Davis for governor. Two years earlier, 72
percent of Hispanics nationally voted for President Clinton's
reelection.
</P>
<P>
   Some political scientists say the challenge for Bush will be to
build on his good relations with Hispanics while not alienating the
more traditional conservative elements of the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   John Garcia, a University of Arizona political scientist, said
that if Bush is the GOP nominee, ``he will be putting himself into
the position of speaking for Republican Party positions that could
make Hispanics uncomfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Bush supports vouchers that would subsidize public
school students who want to attend private schools, a position
opposed by the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC), a
non-partisan Hispanic civil rights organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to keep close watch on Governor Bush,'' said Rick
Dovalina, a Houston lawyer who is president of LULAC. ``He knows
the language and the culture, but that doesn't mean Gore couldn't
do well among Hispanics.''

SENATE TO DEBATE `PATIENTS' BILL OF RIGHTS' IN MANAGED CARE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, July 11)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JUDY HOLLAND  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When the Senate this week considers regulating
managed health care, the debate is expected to focus on questions
of who should decide what medical treatment is appropriate _ and
what a patient unhappy with the decision can do about it.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Republican leaders, insurers and business groups opposing
more regulation of the health industry are pitted against Senate
Democratic leaders, consumer groups and the American Medical
Association urging Congress to guarantee broader rights for
patients.
</P>
<P>
   At the vortex is a proposal by Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif.,
that would allow a patient's own doctor, not accountants or medical
consultants hired to cut costs, to determine when a treatment is
medically necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein complains that a physician who recommends treatment
such as medication, or diagnostic tests or surgery is too often
overruled by representatives of managed care providers, HMOs or
health insurance plans, who second-guess the decision in an effort
to control costs.
</P>
<P>
   If a health plan covers a treatment and a physician determines
it is needed, the patient should be treated based on the illness,
``not based on the calculation of a green eyeshade in a health
insurance plan,'' Feinstein said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Insurance companies have invaded the examining room, the
emergency room and the hospital room,'' said Feinstein, the
daughter of a surgeon and whose late husband, Bert Feinstein, was a
neurosurgeon.
</P>
<P>
   But many Republican opponents, including Sens. Don Nickles,
R-Okla., and Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pa., warn that health care costs
would skyrocket if insurers are unable to review the treatment
decisions of physicians. They say it would be unfair to managed
care providers who must foot the bill if they are not able to
double check a doctor's recommendation.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans argue that patients may benefit if the insurer takes
a second look because physicians differ in their abilities. They
also cite studies showing that doctors make different treatment
decisions depending on the race or gender of the patient or the
region of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Republicans and Democrats also differ over what to do
about patients who are denied coverage by their managed care
providers.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, led by Senate Minority Leader Thomas A. Daschle,
D-S.D., and Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., cite emotional horror
stories of patients who have lost their lives and limbs because
managed care providers wrongly denied coverage.
</P>
<P>
   To prevent such abuses, Senate Democrats say Congress needs to
hand patients a bigger legal stick.
</P>
<P>
   They want to change the law to allow a patient to sue managed
care providers in state courts for pain and suffering and punitive
damages _ whatever is allowable under the state's law _ if a
patient was harmed because a treatment was wrongfully denied.
</P>
<P>
   Federal law now bars patients with employer-provided health
insurance from suing the managed care provider for any damages
beyond the cost of the wrongfully denied treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans and their businesses know they can be held
accountable when they do something wrong,'' says Sen. Richard
Durbin, D-Ill. ``HMOs who make life and death decisions should be
no different. It's time these insurance companies accept
responsibility for their actions.''
</P>
<P>
   Insurers, business groups and Republican Senate leaders argue
that expanding a patient's right to sue would lead to a flood of
lawsuits, which would jack up health care costs. This in turn would
cause more people to be uninsured because businesses won't be able
to afford to provide health insurance, they say.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Republicans support a scaled-down approach to help
patients fight back if they think they've been wrongfully denied
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   For example, an approach favored by Nickles and Jim Jeffords,
R-Vt., would allow a patient to fight an adverse decision about
coverage by appealing to an independent medical professional who
would review a patient's appeal for coverage.
</P>
<P>
   This outside reviewer, who would be hired by the provider, might
be a health professional at an academic medical center who is a
specialist in the appropriate field. The GOP proposal says an
outside review would be invoked if the patient's health is in
jeopardy and if the cost of treatment exceeds a ``significant
financial threshold'' that would be set by the Secretary of Labor.
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats, including Sens. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., and John
Edwards, D-N.C., say the Republican proposal is full of loopholes
and doesn't guarantee a timely and fair appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards complains that the Republican proposal would allow
managed care providers to select the reviewer.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's fundamentally wrong with it, is it is not an
independent review,'' Edwards said. ``We want to create a truly
independent review process _ one that is not controlled by the
insurance company or HMO.'' Edwards, who is still drafting his
legislation, says the outside reviewer should have to meet rigorous
criteria and be periodically reviewed by government officials.
</P>
<P>
   A coalition of business groups and health insurers have shelled
out $750,000 for a media blitz that includes television and print
ads depicting a hardhat worker saying he doesn't know much about
politics but that he fears politicians will pass laws to make his
health insurance more expensive.
</P>
<P>
   The hardhat's comments about costs are typical of the approach
of critics.
</P>
<P>
   Chip Kahn, president of the Health Insurance Association of
America, which represents 269 major insurance companies, said the
Democratic proposals ``would increase the cost of premiums and
decrease the amount of covered Americans, particularly those who
work for small business, because many businesses will drop their
insurance plans.''
</P>
<P>
   But consumer groups say the managed care system is badly ailing.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have lost confidence in the health care system,'' said
Joanne Hustead, director of legal and public policy, for the
National Partnership for Women and Families, a patient advocacy
group.
</P>
<P>
   ``They see people who are not getting the care they need and
when they need it and they are being hassled by the insurers. They
have a genuine fear that money is what's driving the system, not
patient care.''

Saturday, July 10, sent to computer graphics clients of The New

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Widely separated thunderstorms will again erupt over parts of
Arizona, southern Nevada and southern California on Saturday as a
rich supply of tropical moisture from the Gulf of California
combines with solar heating to destabilize the atmosphere. Weak
steering winds aloft will again heighten the risk of flash flooding
in spots.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, clusters of showers and thunderstorms, some with
heavy rain, will develop near a slowing cool front from northern
Texas to the Tennessee and Ohio valleys as very humid air from the
Gulf of Mexico interacts with the front. A pool of warm air aloft
should discourage explosively tall storms, thereby limiting the
threat of severe weather. Nonetheless, rainfalls in excess of two
inches and flash flooding are possible. The risk of heavy rain will
extend to parts of the Middle Atlantic states, including West
Virginia, western Virginia and parts of Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   Isolated to scattered thunderstorms will develop along the
Northeastern seaboard ahead of the front. A few of the storms may
contain gusty winds as momentum from fast winds aloft is mixed
toward the ground by currents of sinking air within the storms. An
area of moderate rain will exit northern New England into southeast
Canada.
</P>
<P>
   After a rather cool late spring and early summer, a heat wave
will build in the Northwestern states, with temperatures
approaching 100 degrees in parts of eastern Oregon, eastern
Washington and southern Idaho. Heat will also intensify in
California's Sacramento Valley, where readings could rise above 105
degrees.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Desert Deluge &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In just one hour, 1.05 inches of rain deluged McCarran Airport
in Las Vegas on Thursday, a little more than twice the city's
average for July. Heavier rains fell in other parts of the city,
causing serious flash flooding. This week, with humid air flowing
northward from the tropics, steering winds at altitudes near 18,000
feet have been very weak, sometimes blowing at speeds of 5 miles an
hour or less. As a result, thunderstorms that erupted in the
tropical air mass moved sluggishly, allowing them to concentrate
heavy rains over limited areas and thereby setting the stage for
flooding. &QL;

AS EROTICA GETS MORE PUBLIC, ITS ALLURE MAY BE THREATENED 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By EDWARD ROTHSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It may be that erotica is always a bit bizarre, particularly if
one isn't initiated into its codes of desire. For one left
unseduced, it can seem both discomforting and comical, like Zero
Mostel playing ``the chauffeur and the contessa'' with wealthy
widows in Mel Brooks' film ``The Producers.'' Erotica can make one
feel like a voyeur, observing humanity in all its desperate
nakedness, inventing extreme excitements.
</P>
<P>
   In one recently imagined erotic adventure, for example, the
homoerotic aspects of the Batman saga come to campy consummation:
Robin shaves his legs to fix his ``embarrassing bikini line,''
rejects the advances of the butler, Alfred, and lovingly fondles
the caped-crusader's costume. In another story with more solemn
ambitions, an online lesbian romance heats up as the lovers meet,
one wearing a leather collar, the other demanding that her boots be
licked.
</P>
<P>
   These stories are from ``Best American Erotica 1999,'' a book in
an annual series published by Simon &AMP; Schuster. The series editor,
Susie Bright, who has become the avatar of American erotica with
her widely published anthologies and essays, suggests that such
imaginings give us ``a portrait of the times we live in.'' And
perhaps they do, because submission and dominance, masochism and
sadism, exhibitionism and voyeurism are now familiar from fashion
ads and television shows and mainstream movies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Erotica'' is now a section in book stores, as routine as
``travel'' or ``child care.'' Sex columnists like Candace Bushnell
(``Sex and the City'') become minor celebrities. One writer of
lesbian erotica, Cecilia Tan, teaches erotic writing workshops.
Pornography has become the subject of university conferences,
complete with demonstrations. This past year, in a course on
pornography at Wesleyan University, one student's final project was
to have her wrists bound with rope and ask fellow students to flog
her.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons for the scope of recent erotic obsessions are
familiar: a confluence of political and social changes, an
insatiable quest for ever larger audiences for pop entertainment
and academic absorption in the subjects of body and gender. But the
preoccupations are also more evident because of the dissolving
boundaries between the public and the private in American life.
Erotica and porn, once so private that collections were hidden in
back rooms, have become aggressively public.
</P>
<P>
   This public status has also become explicitly political. Erotica
is now categorized not only by specialized taste but also by
gender, sexual preference and race. Some feminists may have
condemned porn with as much energy as the political right, but the
movement has also led to a celebration of women's erotic experience
in confessional magazine columns and an ever-accumulating
collection of anthologies, including an annual series,
``Herotica.'' The gay and lesbian movements have inspired special
imprints devoted to homosexual publishing, including collections
like ``Best Lesbian Erotica'' and ``Best Gay Erotica.'' There are
books of black erotica (''Dark Eros'' and ``Erotique Noir'') and
even some new categories of sexual exploration (``Queer Dharma:
Voices of Gay Buddhists''). Erotic writing is no longer merely a
matter of sexual arousal; it has become a declaration of identity.
</P>
<P>
   Erotica, of course, has always had a political resonance.
Pornography tends to be highly detailed about the sexual act, but
erotica gives context to the mechanics. Erotica incorporates
personalities, roles, atmosphere; the private realm emerges out of
a public universe.
</P>
<P>
   Modern views of erotica may even have their origin in a social
form of erotic gamesmanship known as libertinism that thrived among
the French aristocracy in the 18th century. As analyzed by Michel
Feher in a recent anthology, ``The Libertine Reader'' (Zone Books),
libertinism was based on an intricate set of doctrines (which have
some familiarity today through the stage and film versions of
Laclos' ``Liaisons Dangereuses'').
</P>
<P>
   For the libertine, desire was an irresistible natural force
pushing social liaisons toward erotic fulfillment. But social
convention had frustrated that natural impulse: the woman was
supposed to renounce physical pleasures, earning a reputation for
constancy and modesty, taking joy in her triumph over nature. If
she succeeded and if men acquiesced, then the two risked succumbing
to the illusion of romantic love.
</P>
<P>
   During the Middle Ages such love was an erotic ideal: the
high-born lady was worshiped with a near-religious fervor by her
knight. Such courtly love almost scorned fulfillment. But
libertines saw this love as a disease. So while they seemingly
respected social conventions (except for some of the more extreme
libertines, like the Marquis de Sade), they also undercut them. Lip
service was paid to public ideas of vice and virtue. But
conversation was laden with double-entendre. The lovers engaged in
an elaborate ritualistic dance, at once cynical about public
demands and deferential to them, leading to the mutually desired
consummation.
</P>
<P>
   This coded interaction may have become a model for the erotic
ideal. A dance takes place that is at once socially forbidden and
tacitly approved, at once violating manners and paying them homage.
Two potential lovers meet in their social roles, playing their
public parts; those roles are eventually shed with their clothing.
The erotic chronicle is as much about those roles as about the
ensuing nakedness; it tells of the passage from public to private.
</P>
<P>
   But what happens today, as erotic life becomes fully public? The
key tension is gone. Some of the more extreme forms of sexual
behavior once relegated to shame and secrecy, like sadomasochism,
have become integrated into public life. Coded behavior and
signals, the secret language of sexual subcultures, are now common
parlance. And little is considered forbidden or outrageous. The
dance of the libertine is over.
</P>
<P>
   Contemporary erotica also takes on another role. Because of the
political edge given to it by ethnic and sexual movements, erotica
doesn't just embrace the public, it dismisses the private. Erotic
tastes become political declarations. Instead of erotica telling of
the shedding of public personas, it now tells of the adopting of
them. The erotic is found in the very act of exposure.
</P>
<P>
   For many readers, this approach is stimulating unusual demand,
but for one left unseduced, much recent erotica is painfully dull
and anxiously insistent. The ``Best American Erotica'' annual can
seem preoccupied with aggression and display: Zeus flees in
bewildered fear from a mortal woman who energetically welcomes his
attempted rape; a lesbian tries to avenge her transgendered lover's
murder by a homophobic mobster.
</P>
<P>
   In contemporary American culture the omnipresent erotic has even
spurred interest in what might be considered ``meta-porn,'' not
pornographic material but material about pornographic material, in
erotica conventions, art exhibits and films like ``Boogie Nights.''
If porn itself doesn't evoke the excitements of a private realm,
maybe porn about porn will.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, now and then there are hints that this too shall
pass. For once erotica becomes fully public, all these expressions
of sexual desire begin to seem as artificial and arbitrary as a
chauffeur's cap. ``What are you wearing?'' a leering telephone
caller asks a woman in one of the annual's stories. And she
fearlessly replies: ``I am wearing a purple and green polka-dotted
clown suit, with a big yellow ruff collar and huge white pom-pom
buttons.''

MY DINNER WITH COLIN COWIE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release on Sunday, July 11)  
 (HLW)  
 By BOB MORRIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Perhaps it was because I don't have a television show
of my own or that I've never been interviewed by Charlie Rose.
Perhaps it was because being seated well at Balthazar or 44 is
beyond me. More likely it was because Damon Runyon got it right
when he wrote that ``a freeloader is a confirmed guest.''
</P>
<P>
   For whatever reason, I recently accepted an invitation to dine
at a new TriBeCa restaurant called City Hall, for a taping of
``Everyday Elegance With Colin Cowie,'' a cable television series
about ``life as it should be,'' shown on the Romance Classics and
American Movie Classics networks.
</P>
<P>
   Life as it should be, of course, isn't what it used to be.
</P>
<P>
   Dutifully dressed in the ``casual elegant informal evening
wear'' suggested to me by fax, I walked into the private dining
room at City Hall, where Cowie, a post-Martha Stewart life style
guru with a tan, was busy rehearsing a conversation he was about to
tape with Henry Meer, the restaurant's owner and chef. I sat down
quietly, almost apologetically, in the shadows with the designer
Cynthia Rowley, another guest, whose newborn baby was at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, I had to stay home a lot when I was pregnant,'' Ms.
Rowley said cheerfully. ``I'm here because right about now, I'm
willing to sit through almost anything that'll get me out of the
house.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Settle, please!'' and ``Lock it up,'' some of the 25 crew
members were suddenly yelling. Ms. Rowley and I agreed to give each
other a big, fake smile across the table if we saw spinach in each
other's teeth. It was time to meet Cowie, the Austin Powers of
party planners, to whom clients like Demi Moore, Hugh Hefner and
Paula Abdul turn for over-the-top touches like shirtless waiters,
live elephants and swimming pools filled with flowers.
</P>
<P>
   Most experts on entertaining say that a cardinal rule is to
spend time with your guests when they arrive, rather than fussing
behind the scenes. But the telegenic Cowie, who is the author of
``Colin Cowie Weddings'' and ``Effortless Elegance With Colin
Cowie,'' could manage giving us only a moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you all met?'' he asked. With the help of the producer
who had booked us, he hurriedly introduced us to each other as if
we were his good friends: myself; Ms. Rowley; Meer; Gillian Duffy,
the culinary editor at New York magazine; and Lisa Archembault, a
marketing executive from Lenox china, which has a design contract
with Cowie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Champagne, anyone?'' he asked in his mellifluous South African
accent, before skittering off to deal with the technical details of
his dinner party, none of which involved cooking.
</P>
<P>
   In his wake, an assistant in a headset (will the headset become
the tiara of the next millennium?) asked if we'd like to hear the
menu. Then I was escorted to makeup. ``You look good,'' a makeup
woman said as she worked on my face so much that I started to feel
paranoid. ``You'll be great on TV. Just remember to take small
portions, and don't pick your teeth.''
</P>
<P>
   So, now I was camera-ready. But what does it mean to be
camera-ready at a dinner party? Dinner parties were once meant to
be seen by nobody but the people in the room. Today, we live in a
society approaching the only slightly exaggerated scenarios of
``The Truman Show'' and ``EdTV,'' in which cocktail hours and
benefit dinners are taped and broadcast on New York 1 and E! as if
they were scripted productions.
</P>
<P>
   On ``Everyday Elegance With Colin Cowie,'' being camera-ready
means not sitting down too hard on the radio transmitter in your
back pocket that runs the microphone clipped to your collar. It
means having only one conversation at a time, as conducted by
Cowie. It means knowing your basic table manners, which require
that you do not pick up your fork until your host begins eating.
And it also means knowing not to waste too much energy becoming
excited about the food until the camera is in place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please reserve your comments about each course until we start
filming,'' John Heller, the director, said.
</P>
<P>
   These little strictures didn't bother me. I have decent table
manners, or at least I can play someone with decent manners on
television. The problem was the conversation. Cowie started by
asking us how we like to set our tables. When it was my turn to
answer, I muttered something about keeping my dinner table casual.
Then I clammed up, forcing the camera to focus on someone else. And
when, after a first course, Cowie focused on the topic of hors
d'oeuvres, I was totally flummoxed. I mean, movies, politics,
trendy pharmaceuticals, even literature, I could do. But hors
d'oeuvres? Ms. Duffy, a cheerful Englishwoman who has published a
book on the subject, firmly declared that a proper hors d'oeuvre
should be eaten in one bite. Suddenly, the camera was on me again.
I had to think fast.
</P>
<P>
   ``And is that something that you knew  &UR; before &LR;  you started
writing your book,'' I found myself asking brightly, ``or was it
something you discovered  &UR; after &LR;  all your research?''
</P>
<P>
   Who was this person talking? Normally, the only way you'd find
me discussing hors d'oeuvres is with a fake foreign accent. But
this was not an environment in which to indulge in any natural-born
sarcasm. This dinner conversation was meant to be an earnest
discussion of etiquette, gardening and our party plans for the
millennium. It was also about nodding appreciatively when Cowie
made pronouncements on such things as the genius of serving takeout
food at parties.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't until he started virulently criticizing cell phones,
call-waiting and our high-tech society that my dinner with Colin
suddenly became surreal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to learn to simplify our lives,'' Cowie said with
urgency, even as the lights glared and the camera stared and
technicians fiddled with elaborate equipment. ``We should not allow
ourselves to be controlled by all these electronic interruptions.''
</P>
<P>
   Simplify? I felt as if I were hallucinating, as though I'd
wandered into the Mad Hatter's tea party.
</P>
<P>
   I was brought back to earth by a sound engineer ripping off his
headset. ``This is absurd!'' he shouted at a fellow crew member.
``I'm hearing you eating litchi nuts!''
</P>
<P>
   So much for not allowing ourselves to be controlled by
electronic interruptions.
</P>
<P>
   Well, never mind. It was time for strawberries and poppy-seed
shortcake. After consuming it as telegenically as possible (small
bites), Ms. Rowley and I exchanged big, fake smiles across the
table, while Cowie vaporized about life's being an onion that you
peel to reach your soul at the center. But by then, what he was
saying didn't matter. The important thing was that there were no
poppy seeds stuck between my teeth. On that small note of personal
triumph, we said good night, and I walked home, still in makeup,
filled with good food and dark thoughts about a world in which to
be is to be on television.
</P>
<P>
   I have seen the TV dinner of the future, and it isn't Swanson's.

CLEAVAGE-REVEALING, MIDRIFF-BARING OFFICE ATTIRE 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sun., July 11) 
(jt) 
 By JOANNE GALLUCCI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Who are the young businesswomen of tomorrow? One need look no
further than the 20-something, miniskirt-clinging,
cleavage-revealing, midriff-bulging, tattoo-touting assistants and
interns of today.
</P>
<P>
   Summer has returned, along with an array of new, young workers
and casual-dress policies. But as soon as the rules of those
policies are e-mailed to employees _ no sandals, tank tops, jeans
or shorts _ it seems that every junior female worker brushes the
cobwebs from her skin-tight miniskirts and spaghetti-strap dresses
(not to mention the forbidden sandals and tank tops) and parades
them onto the office runway.
</P>
<P>
   Don't get me wrong. I don't believe in policing office attire.
But for us over-the-hill, 30-something bosses, the workplace is far
different than in our heyday, when cleavage was reserved for girls'
night out or for ``the'' man.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent staff meeting, a young woman passed by, wearing the
latest fashion T-shirt _ pink with a three-quarter-length V-neck _
and a miniskirt. A fashionable, 36-year-old colleague shook her
head in disbelief. ``I never dressed liked that at the office when
I was their age,'' she said. She still doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   It's funny how the ultra-casual look hasn't extended to male
newcomers to the office, leaving women deprived in the ogling
department. During my 10 years in the communications profession,
known for its creative and liberal work environment, I can't recall
one inappropriately dressed young man. Khakis, loafers, long-sleeve
cotton shirts and short-sleeve golf shirts seem to epitomize
today's young male professional.
</P>
<P>
   When was the last time a young man _ or any man, for that matter
_ showed up for a meeting in a muscle shirt? Maybe the young men
are less slaves to fashion _ or more concerned with establishing a
professional work environment.
</P>
<P>
   But let's be real. We all have our
less-than-professional-looking days, and we all have the occasional
urge to break the rules of dress _ especially on a 100-degree
summer day when my stockings and Brooks Brothers jacket stick like
glue and almost need to be peeled off at the end of the day.
</P>
<P>
   The difference, of course, is that most of us don't give in to
the urge to be unprofessional.
</P>
<P>
   When I was a 16-year-old ``salesgirl'' in a clothing store, I
was scolded for chewing gum on the sales floor. Yet my body was
fully covered and unadorned with pierced or painted objects. If the
owner had known how lucky he was, I'm sure I would have received
the salesgirl-of-the-month award.
</P>
<P>
   When I was a TV newsroom intern in 1987, the norm was collared
blouses and tailored slacks, or skirts to the knee. A few years
later, lapel suits, scarves and collar shirts were career
favorites. T-shirts and sandals were reserved for the beach.
</P>
<P>
   Styles change, of course, and individuality should play a role
in anyone's wardrobe. Yet by the looks of it, a professional
appearance is no longer important to young professional women.
Expressing sexuality is.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, as I sat across from an Ivy League graduate 10
years my junior who was revealing cleavage as deep as the Great
Divide, I couldn't help but wonder why. A low salary or $20,000
tuition bills may be an excuse for an inadequate wardrobe, but
where was the brain that rewarded her with such a prestigious
degree?
</P>
<P>
   Call me conservative, but cut me some slack. I watch MTV and
VH-1 and have been known to party on weekends, too. I just happen
to think that peekaboo T-shirts and stretch pants that hug every
nook and cranny belong on a college campus, not in a meeting room
full of executives.
</P>
<P>
   This brings me to one all-important question. What new career
statements will be ushered in with the new millennium? Judging from
our recent track record, clothes will probably be outlawed. Then,
at least, we'll all be equals.
</P>

BUILDING A LIFE ON A SYSTEM OF SUPPORT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By J.R. LABBE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Shelby Littlejohn is a delightful 15-year-old, excitedly looking
forward to her sophomore year at Martin High School in Arlington,
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Singing in the choir for the fifth year coupled with the
possibility of joining the debate team and becoming a member of the
school's Explorer Post adds to the appeal of returning to school
next month.
</P>
<P>
   The ages-old adult-to-youngster question of, ``What do you want
to be when you grow up?'' drew an interesting response as we sat in
the shade enjoying a breezy Fourth of July weekend picnic and swap
meet.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the past six years I've dreamed of being a police
officer,'' Shelby says. This elicits a groan from my husband, who,
after almost 24 years on the job, can think of a bazillion better
career choices.
</P>
<P>
   Shelby, a lock of dark hair held back from her face by a
butterfly clip, is undeterred.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watch every reality-based police show on TV,'' she says, her
words blessedly bereft of the ``you knows'' and ``likes'' that
punctuate so many of the conversations of teen-age girls these
days. ``I can't think of a more rewarding job than serving
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, the innocence of youth. Far be it for me to shatter a girl's
dream by bringing up the dark side of serving the public _ lousy
pay, lousy hours, no respect and the constant threat of lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Shelby represents what too many people have lost sight of today
_ the typical American teen-ager. Haunted by stories in the media
about murderous youth and out-of-control teens, we've lost our
perspective. America's schools are not overflowing with Kip
Kinkels, Eric Harrises and Dylan Klebolds. The vast majority of
young people handle the stresses of growing up in very normal ways.
</P>
<P>
   Shelby would be the first to tell you she's not perfect _ if she
didn't, her parents and grandparents would volunteer that
information. She's struggled with some of the challenges that
typically face teens in a highly mobile and increasingly
materialistic society.
</P>
<P>
   When her accountant father was transferred from New Jersey back
to Texas recently after being away for seven years, Shelby had
problems leaving behind her friends only to find herself plopped
down into one of the biggest high schools in the Metroplex _
Arlington's version of ``Beverly Hills 90210.'' The pressure to
look right, dress right, drive the right car and be invited to the
right parties is intense. If you aren't a conformist _ and Shelby
most definitely is not _ high school can be a booger bear.
</P>
<P>
   But make note of the key words in the above paragraphs that are
important clues as to why Shelby, despite a bump in the road every
now and then, will no doubt make it. ``Parents'' David and Melanie
Littlejohn, ``grandparents'' Ed and Kay Buie _ a family that is
there for her, the support system on which to build a successful
life.
</P>
<P>
   Despite her grandfather's protestations that he's ``too critical
of her,'' Shelby is the apple of his eye, if you'll pardon the
cliche. In fact, when I met her she was spending the day with
Grandpa as she has many days, at the Arlington Sportsman's Club.
She says she's a fair shot with a .22 rifle _ ``I'm getting pretty
consistent on my groupings'' _ and is learning her way around a
pistol, all under Grandpa's loving and watchful eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Buie is teaching Shelby what thousands of other parents and
grandparents have passed along to their young 'uns through the
years _ the feeling of accomplishment that comes from perfecting
one's skill at an individual sport. In this case, that sport just
happens to be target shooting. Being female is an asset for Shelby,
since girls generally have better eye-to-hand coordination than
boys, an important factor in accuracy.
</P>
<P>
   How about that? An American teen who's struggled with being
``different,'' finding confidence in something that's been roundly
condemned across the country as the ruination of today's youth _
guns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to watch skeet matches on TV when we lived in New
Jersey and it looked interesting,'' said Shelby. ``When we moved to
Texas, I found out that Grandpa was involved in the Arlington
Sportsman's Club. I told him I wanted to see what it was all
about.''
</P>
<P>
   She found that it was about learning respect for guns and the
responsibility of gun ownership. It also provided a sense of
control that Shelby said she felt was lacking in the rest of her
life. She credits the shooting club with keeping her mind off New
Jersey and the friends she left behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``The move was hard, real hard,'' admits the youngster. ``I
would get lonely and depressed. Target shooting helped me not to
think about it. When I get a good grouping, I feel like, `I did
that. I'm in control. I tried and I got it right.' ''
</P>
<P>
   And Shelby has developed a special bond with her grandfather,
partly through the interest they share in shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've gone to a couple of gun shows together and we go to
lunch after. We make a day of it,'' Shelby said. ``He's very
patient when working with me at the range.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I work with my Grandpa it's like working with my father.
We're that close.''
</P>
<P>
   Little one, you're going to be just fine.

 &HT;    NOXIOUS OZONE TO BE MONITORED IN SMOKIES
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (l) lifestyle categories.
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON - Air quality specialists are setting up an
intensified monitoring program in order to warn visitors to Great
Smoky Mountains National Park whenever levels of noxious ozone
approach unhealthful levels, officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The park in eastern Tennessee and western North Carolina is
America's most popular national park, with more than 9 million
visitors a year.
</P>
<P>
   However, a variety of factors, including its location and
topography, often lead to ozone pollution levels higher than those
of some of the most polluted cities in America.
</P>
<P>
   National Park Service officials, as well as city and state
officials, need better ``tools'' to forecast high ozone conditions
in the region, said Will Pendergrass, a National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration meteorologist at Oak Ridge, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   The East Tennessee Ozone Study will attempt to refine
meteorological models used in the forecasts, as well as determine
where the pollutants leading to the ozone are coming from,
Pendergrass said.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the study, NOAA will install 12 new air quality
monitors in the park and on state fire towers around it and tie
them into ozone monitors operated by the National Park Service and
the cities of Chattanooga, Knoxville and Johnson City, Tenn., he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The study will not cover the portion of the park in North
Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   National Park Service air resource specialist Jim Renfro said
the number of days when eight-hour ozone levels in the park exceed
Clean Air Act standards has been growing in recent years. Last year
there were 44.
</P>
<P>
   Among nearby cities, only Atlanta and Charlotte had more bad
ozone days.
</P>
<P>
   The highest reading last year was on Aug. 25. Coincidentally, a
hiker had to be evacuated from the park by ambulance that day
because of an asthma attack that was not alleviated by inhalants.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, there have been nine days that exceeded Clean
Air Act standards. Ozone levels in the park are usually worst in
late July and August, Renfro said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the park's mountains appear to inhibit the kind of air
movements that cause urban ozone levels typically to fluctuate
widely every day, with relatively clean nights, followed by high
levels in mid-afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, ozone levels in the park sometimes peak at midnight
and endure throughout the day, especially on mountain ridge lines.
</P>
<P>
   Black cherry, tulip poplar and blackberries are among plant
species that are showing damage from ozone, he said.

   HEALDSBURG, Calif. _ Even years ago, when the giant E.&AMP;J. Gallo
Winery began its assault on the more expensive, $12-and-up wine
category, Gina Gallo was just 25 and preparing for a career in
sales with the family business. Today she is a winemaker at the
money-is-no-object Sonoma operation of the company and, perhaps
more important, the face of the new Gallo in a multimillion dollar
ad campaign aimed at giving the venerable brand a new veneer of
prestige.
</P>
<P>
   For the famously private Gallos, putting Gina front and center
is a major departure. But she is a bit out of the mold, too, a more
relaxed, less combative Gallo.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike her great uncle, the winery patriarch Ernest Gallo, she
doesn't interrogate visitors for any useful information. Instead,
she speaks with passion of her deep involvement in producing
premium red wines: cabernet sauvignon, merlot, pinot noir, and
zinfandel, as well as smaller lots of Italian varietals like
barbera and sangiovese.
</P>
<P>
   ``Definitely my first love is making the wine,'' said Ms. Gallo,
adding that she fell into winemaking by chance, after some classes
in enology at the University of California at Davis. ``When I was
in sales, I asked if I could go to U.C. Davis on the side, just to
understand what was in the wine,'' she said. ``Then I sat through
my first class and knew that was what I wanted to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Wearing faded denims and no makeup, Ms. Gallo still looks the
part of a cellar worker. But she has access to that rarest of
assets in wine-making, virtually unlimited capital. She takes
pleasure in the costly innovations the Gallos have implemented at
their winery.
</P>
<P>
   No one ever doubted that the Gallos could make good, even great,
wine if they wanted. The bigger issue was whether consumers, who
may associate the Gallo name with inexpensive jug wines like Hearty
Burgundy, would ever accept a premium varietal wine with the Gallo
label.
</P>
<P>
   Although she acknowledges that problem, Ms. Gallo said she sees
it as an advantage. ``If you have that family relationship with 65
years of history, that's attractive to people,'' she said. ``The
reason why we could put Gallo on the top of the line is because we
have that story.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, as Ernest Gallo said in a 1992 interview, ``using a
different brand would not be any fun.'' As president, Gallo, who is
90, still runs the marketing side of the winery, which is the
world's largest. His brother Julio died in an automobile accident
in 1993. Ms. Gallo, who is 32, is one of Julio's grandchildren; her
father, Robert Gallo, leads the production side. Twelve of 20
third-generation Gallos work in the business.
</P>
<P>
   The $4 million print and broadcast campaign spotlights Ms. Gallo
outside a barn-like building with a weathered wooden sign reading
``Gallo of Sonoma.'' Some wineries here in the bucolic Dry Creek
Valley of Sonoma County, north of San Francisco, still have
settings like that. Gallo's operations, however, more closely
resemble an oil refinery, with an unmarked entry road and a
security guard.
</P>
<P>
   But if the ads are a bit contrived, Ms. Gallo is, by contrast,
direct. She is quick to give credit to the other winemaker at
Gallo-Sonoma, Bob L. Bertheau, 36, for stewardship of the white
wines, primarily chardonnay and sauvignon blanc, and to Marcello
Monticelli, 52, a 30-year Gallo veteran who heads winemaking at
Sonoma.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most winemakers today, who go from one promotional dinner
to another, Ms. Gallo travels little. She said she prefers to let
the wine speak for itself than to peddle it at tasting events.
Married, but with no children yet, she looks forward to a full role
in raising a family.
</P>
<P>
   Growing up herself in Modesto, the Central Valley site of
Gallo's headquarters, ``we always had to be at the dinner table at
7 o'clock no matter what, and wine was very much a part of that,''
she said. Wine is standard at her table, too, but not necessarily
her own wines. She has an encyclopedic knowledge of California
winemakers, even small ones like Screaming Eagle. Tasting their
wines gives a sense of what is possible, she said.
</P>
<P>
   For Ms. Gallo, winemaking is always an adventure. ``In sales,
once I had the fundamental part down of how to sell, the excitement
for me died,'' she said. ``In winemaking, you understand it truly
is an art, and you don't ever master it. It is ever-challenging.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Gallos long disdained wine criticism, they now
court publications like Wine Spectator. Recent reviews of the
Gallo-Sonoma wines in that magazine gave them scores in the low 90s
on a 100-point scale, very competitive with other California wines
at similar prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``The third-party accolades are very helpful,'' Ms. Gallo said.
``It means reviewers are tasting your wine blind and saying, `This
is amazing.''' Noting with obvious pride that the winery
consistently sells out of its single-vineyard and estate-bottled
wines, she added, ``someone out there is enjoying them.''

   ST. HELENA, Calif. _ Farmers and vintners in California's Napa
Valley have long exploited the region's combination of soil,
climate and topography to make wines that can compete with those of
the great Bordeaux estates. Shrewd marketing and a robust economy
have given premium Napa wines a romance and prestige that help lift
sales of wine produced throughout the state.
</P>
<P>
   Napa winemaking has proven so successful, in fact, that there is
very little land left on the valley floor to plant new vines. To
expand output, the wineries are planting on the surrounding
hillsides, arousing a backlash driven by environmental concerns
ranging from water pollution caused by soil erosion and pesticides
to the destruction of oak trees and wildlife habitat.
</P>
<P>
   Pushed by environmentalists, the Napa County Board of
Supervisors has already enacted regulations aimed at curbing
hillside vineyards, and the board's five elected members are being
pressed by constituents to make the rules even more restrictive.
</P>
<P>
   Winemakers say hillsides are not only the last available land
for Napa vineyards but also the best land for producing world-class
wine grapes _ though the most expensive to develop. At the very
least, they say, the new rules would drive development costs even
higher. Planting a new hillside vineyard costs $35,000 to $40,000
an acre, on top of the price of the land.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to conserve habitat,'' said Chris Malan, a county
mental health counselor who leads Concerned Citizens for Napa
Hillsides, a small but politically vocal environmental group. ``We
need to protect our tree canopy. We need to not construct
infrastructure in the hillsides that causes flooding.''
</P>
<P>
   Napa County's landmark 1991 hillside ordinance permits farming
on slopes with grades as steep as 22.5 degrees, or 50 percent,
meaning the land rises one foot for every two horizontal feet. Ms.
Malan wants the county to tighten that limit to 13.5-degree grades
(up a foot for every 3.33 horizontal feet). Better still, she said,
would be a moratorium on all new vineyard development. ``This is a
very small county,'' she said. ``We have to reach the limit at some
point.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of Napa's national reputation, the fight has attracted
attention from environmental groups across the country. They say
they will not hesitate to intervene if measures to clean up the
Napa River and protect wildlife seem inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's just a matter of saying, `We're going to do some study
and crack down on future development,' then that won't solve the
problem,'' said Bruce Hamilton, conservation director for the
Sierra Club. ``California, using federal standards, classified the
Napa River as impaired in 1987. If the state fails to act, then the
federal government could step in.
</P>
<P>
   ``And if neither acts,'' he added, ``then a private group like
the Sierra Club could,'' by going to court.
</P>
<P>
   Winemakers say county figures show that soil erosion has
declined by more than two-thirds since 1991. ``Many of us think the
current ordinance is pretty damn good and the problem is enforcing
it,'' said Dennis Groth, president of Groth Vineyards in Oakville.
</P>
<P>
   The wine growers cautiously embraced recommendations by a county
task force that recently evaluated Napa's hillside ordinance. The
task force, whose members included winemakers and environmentalists
as well as engineers and government officials, rejected proposals
like a moratorium on new vineyards and extending the rules to cover
replanting of existing vineyards grandfathered under the 1991 law.
Instead, it called for further study.
</P>
<P>
   Compliance with the law is largely voluntary; enforcement is
limited to responding to the public's complaints, according to
county officials. The number of vineyards that break the rules,
while thought to be small, is not known.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the problems that have come to light have been damaging
for the winemakers. ``When somebody violates the law, the finger
points at all of us,'' said Thomas Shelton, chief executive of
Joseph Phelps Vineyards and president of the Napa Vintners
Association. ``Enforcement of existing regulations is something we
can all agree on.''
</P>
<P>
   Some in Napa say that planting hillsides does not make economic
sense anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue is not growth; the issue is profit,'' said Volker
Eisele, a vintner and grape grower with 60 acres who is also an
environmental activist. ``When land values and business values
climb to such astronomical heights, there is a lot at stake.'' For
what it now costs to develop hillside vineyards, he said, ``to make
such a venture pay, you're looking at a $60 to $80 bottle price,
and I have trouble believing that you can project that kind of
price into the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Eisele said the Napa industry should grow by increasing quality,
not quantity.
</P>
<P>
   For Stuart Smith, whose 30-acre Smith-Madrone Vineyards and
Winery lies nearly 1,000 feet above St. Helena in the Mayacamas
Range, growth is very much an issue. Smith, who is seeking county
permission to convert six and a half more acres into vineyards,
says modern agricultural techniques can minimize soil erosion and
habitat loss. And no one should underestimate nature's resilience,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   He pointed to a faded redwood stake, one of many he has found on
his property, that supported a grapevine more than a century ago.
The tall pine trees and scrub that now surround it are evidence of
the forest's regenerative vitality, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The forest wants to take back the vineyards,'' Smith said.
``It's a constant battle for us to keep the forest at bay.''

`A RIDE WITH BOB,' COURTESY OF ASLEEP AT THE WHEEL &HT;   
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   &HT;    By RICK MITCHELL
 &HT;    c.1999 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   (UNDATED) Asleep at the Wheel's Grammy Award-winning
instrumental, String of Pars, was inspired by a particularly
well-played round of golf.
</P>
<P>
   When guitarist Ray Benson called last week after 18 holes at
Willie Nelson's Pedernales course outside Austin, he was in no mood
to write a sequel: String of Bogeys doesn't have quite the same
ring to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a string of somethings,'' Benson said. ``It was
threatening par.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, when Nelson plays his own course, par is whatever he
shot that day, but that's another story.
</P>
<P>
   Asleep at the Wheel has been identified with the Austin music
scene for so long that many people assume the band was born in
Texas. Not so. Benson founded the Wheel some 30 years ago while he
was living on a farm in rural West Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   An avid record collector, he'd discovered the vintage
western-swing music of Bob Wills and the Texas Playboys when he was
in high school. Other crucial formative influences included Hank
Williams, George Jones, Elvis Presley and Jerry Lee Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   In 1971, the band moved to San Francisco, where it landed a
national record deal. But, Benson said, the Bay-area acid-rock
audiences didn't know what to make of a bunch of long-haired
hippies playing traditional country music.
</P>
<P>
   And so, on the advice of Nelson and Doug Sahm of the Sir Douglas
Quintet, the entire band relocated to Austin in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   Benson said he's never regretted the move.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love this town. We've gone in and out of vogue several
times. At this point, we've become almost venerable.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, the band has been with several record labels,
including three separate tenures at Columbia/Epic and two deals
with Capitol Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   ``Record-label politics can be a real minefield,'' Benson said.
</P>
<P>
   Asleep at the Wheel also has undergone numerous personnel
changes. Benson, the only remaining original member, has had to
reinvent the Wheel several times. He estimates that at least 75
musicians have passed through the band, not counting studio sidemen
and one-night sit-ins.
</P>
<P>
   Benson points out that the current lineup _ featuring Jason
Roberts on fiddle, Cindy Cashdollar on steel guitar, Michael
Francis on sax, Chris Booher on piano and fiddle, Dave Miller on
bass and Dave Sanger on drums _ has been stable for three years,
with Booher the most recent addition.
</P>
<P>
   Through all the ups and downs, Benson has never lost sight of
his original goal, which is to keep the flame burning for his
traditional musical inspirations.
</P>
<P>
   Of those inspirations, the flame that burns the brightest is
that of Wills, the Texas band leader who helped invent western
swing by combining frontier fiddle breakdowns with blues, jazz and
swing.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was one of the seminal figures of American popular music,
like Duke Ellington, Hank Williams and Elvis Presley,'' Benson
said. ``We've been lucky enough to be handed that mantle to
carry.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Asleep at the Wheel recorded a tribute to Bob Wills and
the Texas Playboys, featuring such high-profile guests as Nelson,
George Strait, Garth Brooks, Vince Gill, Dolly Parton and Merle
Haggard.
</P>
<P>
   Despite an almost total blackout on commercial country radio,
the album has sold more than 400,000 copies and is close to being
certified gold.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was disappointing that it didn't get more radio play,''
Benson said. ``But it influenced so many people. I've had a lot of
young country singers _ Wade Hayes, Tracy Byrd _ come up to me and
say, `You really turned my head around with that album.'''
</P>
<P>
   In August, Asleep at the Wheel will release another, even better
Wills tribute album called Ride With Bob. Highlights include
Haggard and the Squirrel Nut Zippers on St. Louis Blues; the Dixie
Chicks singing and swinging on Roly Poly; Lyle Lovett and Shawn
Colvin on Faded Love; and Manhattan Transfer harmonizing with
Nelson on Goin' Away Party.
</P>
<P>
   Other esteemed guests include Steve Wariner and Gill (Bob's
Breakdown); Don Walser (I Ain't Got Nobody); Lee Ann Womack (Heart
to Heart Talk); Reba McEntire (Right or Wrong); Clay Walker (Take
Me Back to Tulsa); Mark Chesnutt (Stay All Night); Dwight Yoakam
(San Antonio Rose); Byrd (You're From Texas); Tim McGraw (Milk Cow
Blues); and Clint Black (Bob Wills Is Still the King).
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of Louisiana's McGraw, the North
Carolina-based Zippers and Manhattan's Transfer, the artists have
strong ties to Texas, Oklahoma or California _ the three states in
which Wills was based from the 1930s through the '60s.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference between Bob Wills and everybody else was that
he incorporated blues and jazz,'' Benson said. ``In the racist
society of Texas in the 1930s and '40s, he imitated black blues
singers and had the highest respect for their musicianship and
intelligence. That's the key to western swing music.''
</P>
<P>
   Ride With Bob is Asleep at the Wheel's first album for the new
Nashville division of DreamWorks records. Because the participating
artists represent so many competing labels, it will be difficult
for DreamWorks to promote a hit single or video from the album.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Benson would like to sell as many copies as possible.
But his real goal is to do justice to Wills' legacy, inspiring new
generations of fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't think of anything I'd rather do than keep playing this
kind of music,'' he said. ``In the past, that hasn't always been
what audiences wanted us to do. Now they do. And I just love it.''

FINANCIAL CONSULTING AT A HIGHER LEVEL  
 THE CEMENT CEILING?

   The nation supports an army of financial planners. But
regardless of whether they consult these professionals, six out of
10 Americans seek financial guidance from a far more established
source. They pray.
</P>
<P>
   A survey by Yankelovich Partners for the Lutheran Brotherhood, a
financial services organization in Minneapolis, asked a random
sample of Americans about money and spirituality, and found that 61
percent said they prayed before making major financial decisions.
Forty-six percent sought financial guidance by reading spiritual
materials, 24 percent by talking to members of the clergy and 17
percent by turning to religious television programs or Internet
sites.
</P>
<P>
   One variation in the responses gave a hint of where following
heavenly guidance could lead. Those who pray regularly were more
likely than those who don't (28 percent to 22 percent) to have lent
money in the past five years to someone in need.
</P>
<P>
   The Cement Ceiling?
</P>
<P>
   Despite the well-publicized accusations that Christian L. Curry
had to fake e-mail to make it look as if his employer, Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter, harbored employees with racial bias, the
overwhelmingly white world of corporate management is genuinely
tough for minorities to break into, according to a group of 109
blacks, Hispanics and Native Americans who are already on the
inside.
</P>
<P>
   The group, all executives and professionals with master's
degrees in business, were surveyed by the Ph.D. Project, a
privately financed effort of businesses and foundations to improve
minority representation in American business.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the likelihood of being hired for corporate
positions, 73 percent of the group said MBAs from minority groups
lagged somewhat or far behind whites. For promotions and raises, 86
percent said minority candidates lagged somewhat or far behind.
</P>
<P>
   There was a bright spot. In the next five years, most of the
group expects that opportunities for new minority MBAs will not
worsen.
</P>
<P>
   A Heck of a Parking Fee
</P>
<P>
   After she helps that special someone select a Patek Philippe and
a couple of Rolexes, the woman who gives with style might also buy
him something to put them in. Perhaps a $3,600 leather and silk
watch box from Scatola del Tempo of Barzano, Italy, featured in an
advertisement in this month's Robb Report, a magazine for
well-heeled consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would you park a Ferrari in the street?'' the ad asks. For the
customer who answers no, Chronotime Inc. in Livingston, N.J., the
American distributor for Scatola del Tempo, supplies retailers with
boxes ranging from a basic one-watch model, at $495, to a $10,000
burlwood box that rotates nine watches at once.
</P>
<P>
   Rotation, explained Terry Chabrowe, a partner at Chronotime, is
an important issue for collectors of fine watches. It sustains the
timekeeping functions of watches designed to be self-wound by the
motion of a wearer's wrist, and it also keeps the watches'
lubricating oils flowing. ``Those watches are designed to keep
moving all the time,'' Chabrowe said.
</P>
<P>
   A $10,000 box is pricey, he added, but the watches inside,
usually owned by men who are fascinated by delicate machinery, can
cost as much as $250,000 each. He said about half the inquiries he
receives about the boxes are from women looking for a perfect gift.

<P>
   The Tongue and Groove club in Buckhead, a well-manicured suburb
of Atlanta, is the sort of place that might make Carrie Bradshaw
and her friends raise their well-groomed eyebrows to the roof.
Definitely the sort of place that would send Carrie, the New York
sex columnist played by Sarah Jessica Parker in the HBO series
``Sex and the City,'' straight to her laptop, cigarette dangling
from her lips, ironically hip gold name necklace and Playboy bunny
pendant nestled in her cleavage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the sort of place where girls wore miniskirts with more
than a hint of spandex, and butterfly clips in their hair,'' she
might have written. ``Occasionally, they fished frosted lip gloss
out of their tiny leather shoulder bags.''
</P>
<P>
   No question that Carrie and her friends, clad in Dolce &AMP;
Gabbana, vintage bustiers and the new Fendi ``baguette'' purse with
floral appliques, might have felt Tongue and Groove was too
mall-like. But on a sweltering July night at a promotional party
that HBO threw there for the show, one of dozens of similar events
planned across the country, the cast was toasted by the crowd in
absentia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like they really are saying the things we're all
thinking,'' said Alana Peters, 29, a software consultant, who wore
a short black Ann Taylor dress and a look of adoration as she gazed
up at the screen on which the latest episode of the show was being
shown. ``And I totally relate to the way they have real fun with
the clothes. I'm all about fashion, and they are saying that
anything goes.''
</P>
<P>
   The success of ``Sex and the City,'' now midway through its
second season, has taken even some of HBO's executives by surprise.
Last year, when the pilot was being edited, some at the pay channel
wondered if the racy, profane, insidery look at the dating scene in
New York would fly in other markets.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Sex and the City,'' which is based loosely on a New York
Observer column by Candace Bushnell and created by Darren Star of
``Melrose Place'' fame, has gained the stirring of a cult
following, not only in New York and big cities like Los Angeles and
San Francisco, but also, according to HBO, in places like
Cleveland, Providence and Baton Rouge.
</P>
<P>
   Although it has been overshadowed somewhat by the acclaim for
HBO's ``Sopranos,'' and can't compete with network shows in terms
of sheer numbers, ``Sex and the City'' regularly beats out the
network competition on Sunday nights in homes that subscribe to
HBO. It has been the highest-rated comedy series on cable for two
years running. Like ``Seinfeld,'' the show seems to belie the
conventional television wisdom that Middle America will reject any
show too clearly set in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Such logic is responsible for the flatness of sitcoms like
``Friends'' and ``Caroline in the City,'' set in Manhattan but
looking suspiciously like the San Fernando Valley, where they were
actually shot, down to the slightly-dated slip dresses, ubiquitous
Gap cargo pants and perky mating rituals.
</P>
<P>
   Safely sequestered on pay television, ``Sex and the City''
blithely bulldozes the conventional wisdom. It views the battle of
the sexes through the eyes of four explicitly Manhattan-dwelling
women who laugh in the face of chastity (and sometimes at their
boyfriends' meager anatomy), chain smoke, stalk next season's
fashions with the ferocity of jungle cats and consider raw oysters
and vodka stingers two of the major food groups.
</P>
<P>
   While many of the plotlines could take place in any big city _
in a recent episode which asks ``Are all men freaks?'' the writers
assembled a cadre of loser bachelors, including a kleptomaniac and
a masochist _ the juiciest details are site specific. In the
``freaks'' episode, for example, one man's foible is that he has
not stepped off the island of Manhattan in 10 years, and the
kleptomaniac does his stealing in a secondhand bookstore in SoHo.
</P>
<P>
   Which begs the question, How has a show so dismissive of
middlebrow tastes and values and so depravedly and uniquely New
York become a darling with HBO's audience in the heartland?
</P>
<P>
   The answer may be timing. The two elements that make ``Sex and
the City'' a hit are sex and the city. For the first time in a
while, both are back in favor _ New York is cool as a travel
destination, and sex no longer seems so dangerous or forbidden as
it did a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of being put off by the endless talk of sexual
performance and the frank language _ the scripts are littered with
four-letter words and coarse euphemisms for body parts _ the young
women at Tongue and Groove said they make sure to rehash episodes
at the coffee machine, loudly. ``We are a mini-New York here,''
said Lara Preister, 24, a college student. ``It's not like we're
Scarlett O'Hara and we get all upset when people swear. As long as
it's funny, we laugh.''
</P>
<P>
   While critics have accused the show of dredging up a retrograde
boy-craziness, some of the women in Atlanta seemed to think the
opposite was true. They found liberation in the bloodless way
characters discussed such things as how to stop a boyfriend from
constantly adjusting his crotch and how to hang onto a man with a
passion for performing oral sex. ``I love that on the show they
talk about men the way that men talk about women,'' said Pat Khan,
40, a media company executive. ``It turns the tables, and I try to
think of how I can do that in my own life.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the show's outre fashion sense has found a way into the
lives of women who until recently might have dismissed it all as
kooky. The look of ``Sex and the City'' was created by Patricia
Field, whose eponymous boutique on Eighth Street in Greenwich
Village has for 30 years been ground zero for New York street
fashion, and her associate, Rebecca Field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shows like this do a good job of raising people's threshold
for what is acceptable,'' said Simon Doonan, the creative director
for Barneys New York. ``Maybe they themselves will never wear
something that aggressively groovy, but if they watch they find
ways to translate it.''
</P>
<P>
   While few women in Atlanta are likely to pair a retro 1970s
acid-washed skirt with a Calvin Klein camisole, Chanel spectator
pumps and a vintage Gucci purse, as Ms. Parker did in a recent
episode, for fans, the show has the allure of flipping through
Vogue. ``I don't copy the show or anything,'' said Nikki Beets, 21,
a waitress, ``but there are a lot of outfits that I say, `Wow, I've
to put something like that together.'''
</P>
<P>
   For Ms. Parker, 34, who not only is the central character, but
also has the title of executive consultant, the look of the series
is crucial to its appeal. A longtime fashion obsessive who speaks
of clothes with the intensity and verve of a Conde Nast editor, she
says that style nuances mean much more on ``Sex and the City'' than
on a conventional show.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, you could do a show about four women in Boston or
Milwaukee or Chicago, but it wouldn't be these women,'' she said in
an interview in late June in her dressing room trailer. ``Instead,
we're trying hard to create a very complex, layered, specific
environment. For these women at this moment in time, getting even
the smallest detail right is as important as making sure they're
being honest in what they say.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   To that end, Ms. Field hired two young men this season who
``come from our school of fashion,'' she said, to search for
clothes and accessories in shops all over the country. Every two
weeks during the six months in which the show is shot, Ms. Field
calls the actresses in for a three-hour fitting and fashion therapy
session. ``Pat is an icon and I freaking grew up with her,'' said
Ms. Parker, who spent her early childhood in Cincinnati but has
lived in New York since she came here as a child actress at 11. ``I
love the way her mind works.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone involved with the show instantly buys into Ms.
Field's fashion statements. Some crew members said there had been
what the entertainment industry would call creative tension over
how far to push the envelope. Star, after all, is the man who in
``Melrose Place'' evoked a Los Angeles of miniskirts, spike heels
and breast implants. In many ways, those have been the
stereotypical ways that female sex appeal has long been portrayed
on television (mostly by male producers). His previous attempt to
portray New York was the misquided ``Central Park West,'' which was
critically lampooned for its California vision of the fast-lane
life of Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a process of evolution,'' Ms. Parker said, referring to
how she and Ms. Field work to convince Star and others on the set
to break the mold. ``Like last week, Darren said, `So explain the
yellow shorts to me, OK?'''
</P>
<P>
   One outfit that has become a flashpoint for the entire crew is
what is referred to as the Heidi Dress, a gathered dirndl that
Carrie wears on a picnic in a future episode. It was the idea of
Ms. Field, who had a feeling that a Heidi moment might be in the
fashion winds. Ms. Parker wears pigtails in the scene, and even
took it upon herself to draw freckles on her cheeks.
</P>
<P>
   Her ideal is the series ``Absolutely Fabulous,'' the British
import that used avante-garde clothing and set design as a
meticulous indicator of character. To that end, she and Ms. Field
fought hard for the tutu that Carrie wears in the opening montage.
They felt their fashion instincts vindicated when, months later,
Badgley Mischka showed similar silhouettes. And the Ray-Ban aviator
sunglasses that Carrie has sported since last season wound up in
the July Vogue.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Field is more direct than Ms. Parker in discussing her
skirmishes with crew members over how the female characters _
besides Ms. Parker, they are played by Kim Cattrall, Kristin Davis
and Cynthia Nixon _ should dress.
</P>
<P>
   ``The straight types just don't get the irony,'' she said on a
recent night in the midst of shooting in Greenwich Village. Still
svelte in her mid-50's, she leaned against a lamppost, ran her
fingers through her fire-red hair and seemed to take in every bit
of street fashion as she spoke.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to say to the guys, `Look, the girls in this show just
aren't going to wear miniskirts with high heels,'' she said. ``No
one in New York dresses like that. Period. That really was a blow
to a lot of people.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the other items barred from the set are scrunchies,
butterfly hair clips and stockings. ``No one I know wears them,
even in the winter,'' said Ms. Parker, who is even working on
getting the makeup team to abandon foundation.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CAN END HERE.
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Rebecca Danenberg, a downtown designer who is one of the fashion
industry's most carefully watched talents, is a fan of ``Sex and
the City.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason the show works for me is that it looks like it came
from an intelligent planet,'' she said. ``It doesn't look like
Hollywood. It looks like Barneys.''

DO AMERICANS HAVE MORE OR LESS LEISURE TIME? 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JANNY SCOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a society in which the long lunch has gone the way of the
screened-in porch and free time often seems as rare as a telephone
without call waiting, it is surprisingly difficult to get a
definitive answer to the deceptively simple question of whether
Americans have more or less time on their hands than they used to.
</P>
<P>
   The research on time use yields evidence for three seemingly
contradictory answers: Americans work longer and have less leisure
time than they did 30 years ago; Americans work less and have more
leisure time; Americans work roughly as much as they used to, at
least on average.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could talk statistics to you from here to midnight,'' said
Randy Ilg, an economist at the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which
has generated its own share of befuddling results. ``But one set of
statistics will give you one point of view and another set of
statistics will tell you something else.''
</P>
<P>
   A big part of the problem is that time-use researchers use
different methods and different data. They depend on the indulgence
and memories of ordinary folks (who, like everyone else, may be
feeling they could use a day off). They study different time
periods. They even have different definitions of basic concepts,
like leisure and work.
</P>
<P>
   But another part of the problem, some researchers say, may be
that they have been asking the wrong question. The question may not
be  &UR; whether &LR;  Americans are working or playing more but  &UR; which  &LR; ones
are. As it turns out, there may be more people underemployed and,
at the same time, more people overworked.
</P>
<P>
   ``What sense does it make to talk about averages if we have two
very divergent realities?'' asked Jiri Zuzanek, a sociologist at
the University of Waterloo in Ontario. Zuzanek recently edited a
special issue of the scholarly journal Society and Leisure devoted
to what some scholars call the ``time famine.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is a group of people who are overworked, and others
are benefiting from a greater amount of leisure, and the trends are
diverging, the average is not particularly meaningful,'' he said.
``That's where I am a little concerned that reporting averages does
not always reflect the dynamics of social change.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Americans may be working longer  &UR; and &LR;  have more leisure
time. That is, some Americans are clearly working longer hours
while others may have more leisure than past generations did. While
hard-driving baby boomers may infatuate the media, many men have
retired early and many people in their 20s and 30s have postponed
marriage and child rearing or are having fewer children.
</P>
<P>
   A 1997 study by the Bureau of Labor Statistics on which Ilg was
a co-author found that the segment of employees working at least 49
hours a week rose from 13 percent in 1976 to 18.5 percent in 1993.
Among those most likely to work very long hours were professionals
and managers, who were also among the highest paid. People in
transportation and sales are also working more, although the
reasons are unclear.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first got into this, I said both sides can't be
right,'' said Jerry Jacobs, a professor of sociology at the
University of Pennsylvania who set himself the task of trying to
reconcile the contradictory views about work and leisure. ``It
turns out that it is logically possible for them both to have a
kernel of truth because they are talking about different people.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from people's personal fascination with the way they use
their time, economists use the information to help assess the
economy's long-term health and growth. Sociologists use it to
trace, among other things, the changing social roles of men and
women, tracking the time they spend working outside and inside the
home.
</P>
<P>
   It's quite possible that many people have an exaggerated sense
of how long they work. The rise of couples in which each one works
has created intense time pressures in families. Many Americans also
have more opportunities than before and more knowledge of
opportunities missed. Leisure activities are increasingly complex
and organized. Meanwhile, e-mail, fax machines and beepers have
muddied the boundary between work and home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people say the only way to make it work off the job is to
treat life off the job like work,'' said James T. Bond, vice
president of the Families and Work Institute, a policy research
institute in New York City that has found that the average workweek
is rising. ``You have to apply good management skills and
scheduling if you want to lead a normal life.''
</P>
<P>
   But when one tries to measure the time Americans spend at work
and leisure, all sorts of perplexing questions crop up. If a person
skips out of the office to run an errand, is that work or something
else? Is commuting work? Should the work of 16- and 17-year-olds be
counted? Are night courses work? When is shopping housework and
when is it recreation?
</P>
<P>
   The largest source of public data on work hours is the Bureau of
Labor Statistics, which regularly surveys 400,000 nonfarm
businesses for the number of hours worked by production and
nonsupervisory employees. It also surveys 50,000 randomly selected
households, conducting telephone interviews about hours worked in
the previous week.
</P>
<P>
   The survey of businesses suggests the average workweek in the
companies studied ``trended down,'' as Ilg put it, from 38.8 in the
mid-1960s to 36.1 in the mid-1970s, 34.9 in the mid-1980s and 34.6
in 1998. The household survey suggests the workweek went from 40
hours in the mid-1960s to approximately 38 in the mid-1970s to 39
in the mid-1980s to 39.3 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, other studies have suggested divergent
conclusions. F. Thomas Juster, an economist at the University of
Michigan who surveyed Americans about their use of time in the
mid-1970s and early 1980s, said he found that total work declined
for both men and women and leisure increased between the mid-1960s
and the early 1980s. He looked at not only paid work but housework,
too.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In 1991 Juliet B. Schor, an economist at Harvard, reported in
``The Overworked American: The Unexpected Decline of Leisure''
(Basic) that time on the job had risen steadily over the previous
20 years. Leisure was dwindling, she said; manufacturing employees,
for example, were working the equivalent of two months longer each
year than their counterparts in West Germany and France.
</P>
<P>
   Then John P. Robinson, a professor of sociology at the
University of Maryland, and Geoffrey Godbey, a professor of leisure
studies at Penn State University, reported the opposite in ``Time
for Life: The Surprising Ways Americans Use Their Time'' (Penn
State Press, 1997). They said men and women were working less than
they did in 1965 and had gained nearly an hour of free time a day.
</P>
<P>
   In a revised edition of the book, due out in September, they
write that further studies they conducted in the 1990s did not show
a continuing decline in people's hours of paid work. Nevertheless,
they said, free time continued to increase, in large part because
the amount of time spent on eating and grooming declined.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Ms. Schor, Robinson and Godbey based their findings
primarily on ``time diaries'' in which people were asked to record
in detail how they spent their time over the course of a day, in
contrast to the Bureau of Labor Statistics' method of asking
employers about hours worked or asking participants to recall their
work hours from the previous week.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson and others say that people exaggerate their hours when
asked to recall them from memory. The more hours they work,
Robinson says, the more they inflate. Meanwhile, critics of the
time diary method say it is biased in the other direction: busy
people are too busy to keep diaries, so the method favors the
unbusy, a charge Robinson denies.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, Ms. Schor and their critics and defenders have all
sorts of other reservations about each side's (and everyone else's)
data _ about the points in the business cycle when the data were
collected, about the representativeness of their samples, about
whether they were measuring time working or simply time at work.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are problems in measurement on both sides,'' said Andrew
S. Harvey, an economist who directs the time-use research program
at St. Mary's University in Halifax, Nova Scotia. ``A lot has to do
with the timing of the observations. Then there's a question of who
you're looking at. If two of you were looking at slightly different
populations, you might get different answers.''
</P>
<P>
   But many researchers also say the data are probably telling
multiple stories at once, not only those of the undeniably
time-pressed couples juggling multiple jobs and young children but
also the stories of unhappily underemployed people perpetually
searching for more work and of men in their early 60s who until
recently were retiring at a younger and younger age.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing everybody agrees on is there is a time divide,''
said Robert Drago, an economist at the University of Wisconsin in
Milwaukee. ``There is a large group of people who are overworked
and there is an arguably smaller group of people who are
underworked and searching for anything to get by. The question of
whether, on average, people are working more or less is maybe not
as important as this time divide.''

GIVE ME YOUR HUDDLED MASSES, YEARNING TO BE FIRM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release on Sunday, July 11)  
 (HLW)  
 By DOUGLAS COOPER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The less you spend on your health, the healthier you
become. This is why East Africans, training barefoot on the
savanna, so routinely humiliated America's best long-distance
runners, despite millions spent on college training programs. And
if the logic here is flawed, I don't want to hear about it.
</P>
<P>
   You see, I can no longer afford my health club. I used to belong
to the Printing House Fitness and Racquet Club on Hudson Street. I
gladly paid close to $100 a month for the privilege of being
coddled into shape. I relished the steam room and the rooftop pool,
even though I never used them. I basked in the rumor that Lou Reed
and Laurie Anderson could be found _ nobody ever actually  &UR; saw &LR; 
them _ doing crunches.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, however, I was forced to confront a typical New York
difficulty: I could pay my health club dues, or I could pay rent.
Rent won out. I gained 20 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, I'd always known about the Carmine Recreation Center
at Clarkson Street and Seventh Avenue South, just a block away from
my rooftop health palace. I used to see it, in fact, from above, as
I trained on the latest cardiovascular equipment in front of
panoramic windows. I never imagined, however, that I might one day
wish to join.
</P>
<P>
   The Carmine Center is a public gym, you see, one of a number
operated by the city, and it costs a member all of $25 a year. I
mean, what kind of annual thing can you get for 25 bucks? Most
people spend more than that yearly on dental floss.
</P>
<P>
   It is a low point in my life when I slouch through that door at
the Carmine Center to ask about signing up. They don't take cash at
Carmine. They like checks and money orders. I don't have a check
with me; the lady behind the desk helpfully mentions that money
orders can be purchased at the nearby check-cashing center.
</P>
<P>
   It seems an appropriate ritual. Before joining this new gym, the
institutional embodiment of my fallen status, I first have to line
up with those of no fixed bank account.
</P>
<P>
   And so I slink back into Carmine, clutching my pitiful money
order. My annual fee. The man standing in front of me has
impressive tattoos. Nervous, I begin to kibitz with the skinny guy
who gets in line behind me.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, you belong to this place long?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Years.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it ... any good?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the best,'' he says. ``It's a neighborhood place. Nothing
like it. Twenty-five bucks and you get everything.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything?'' I say. ``So they have, um, free weights?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything. Free weights, machines, treadmills,
Stairmasters.''
</P>
<P>
   Well now. The scales begin to fall from my eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Except, you want to know something?'' my wiry friend says.
``Those machines do nothing. Stick to free weights.''
</P>
<P>
   This fellow member of the Society of Carmine is thus the first
to introduce me to the Law of Perverse Returns: the less you spend,
the greater your health returns. A circuit of Cybex machines costs
thousands of dollars. Dumbbells? Maybe $25.
</P>
<P>
   I pay my dues and step into the locker room. Hm. Stainless steel
urinals. Nice touch. In fact, there's lots of unpainted steel: the
lockers, the toilet bowls. So far, the Printing House wins out in
terms of surface ornament. It's sort of St.-Tropez versus San
Quentin. Oh, and the showers at Carmine are time-controlled: you
press a button and get a few seconds of warm water.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Some further points of contrast I soon notice. The Printing
House had a towel service; the Carmine Center offers paper towels,
and a sign admonishing you not to dry with them. The Printing House
offered free toiletries: hair conditioner, deodorant and
moisturizer. Carmine has industrial-grade soap in wall dispensers.
On the locker room walls at the Printing House, I would find
notices offering brownstones for sale, time shares in Umbria,
dog-walking services. At Carmine there's a sign that says, ``If it
smells in here, maybe it's because you forgot to flush.''
</P>
<P>
   The Printing House had a spa when I belonged _ steam room,
Jacuzzi, massage rooms _ and since then, to keep up with
ever-escalating competition, it has installed a lavish
entertainment system, including Internet access, to divert patrons
riding the cardio machines. Other private clubs have taken to
offering aromatherapy, nutritionists, even cosmetic-surgery
consultations.
</P>
<P>
   Carmine laughs at such frippery. It does have cardio equipment _
stationary bikes, reclining and upright; Stairmasters; treadmills.
OK,  &UR; a &LR;  treadmill. The second one is out of service.
</P>
<P>
   The treadmill has a sign-up sheet, and the names on this sheet
are Italian, Spanish, African, Chinese. I like this. I mean, I
don't like having to sign up for the treadmill, but it gives me
pleasure that the membership is more diverse than the cast of
``Chariots of Fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Only once every few weeks do I have to wait long to get on one
of the cardio devices. You can't be picky; if the treadmill's in
use, you may have to ride a cycle. This, however, is good for you:
it forces you to alternate muscle groups. (Once again, the
mysterious link between No Cash and Good Health.)
</P>
<P>
   The Cybex machines occupy a single room. They're pushed close
together, and the proximity breeds social interaction. One guy in
particular is really working the room.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey,'' he says to me, ``you look like the guy in the Reebok
ad.''
</P>
<P>
   I've never seen this ad.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look like him.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the extent of our conversation. He turns his attentions
to the women, one by one. They turn him away, pleasantly, then
compare notes in Spanish. He apparently doesn't speak Spanish.
Neither do I.
</P>
<P>
   My favorite place, though, is the free-weight area. This is
where the real work takes place. The heavy lifting, so to speak.
It's even less spacious than the Cybex room _ sweaty giants
pressing iron, shoulder to shoulder. It is, in fact, probably more
than a little dangerous. I keep expecting someone's hammer curl to
nail me to the wall. But these guys are clearly accomplishing just
as much _ frankly, a whole lot more _ than the pampered folks at
the Printing House. Not a body here _ mostly male, but the
occasional female _ doesn't inspire a touch of awe. I no longer
regret my decision to join. Now I want to belong.
</P>
<P>
   Over the course of weeks, I begin to develop a peculiar
reverence for the Carmine Recreation Center. Communal exercise,
after all, isn't restricted to cheery Alpine health films; it
stands at the core of the ancient Greek conception of democracy. In
Plato's ``Republic,'' the question whether women ought to exercise
naked with men is given serious consideration. I begin to suspect
that Carmine is a great civic institution on the order of the New
York Public Library: a defining feature of the egalitarian society.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and by the way, I've lost 40 pounds. My former gym may have
whittled me down some, but this place has carved me like a turkey.
</P>
<P>
   When the Printing House offers a 10-day trial membership, I sign
up just to remind myself what I've been missing. Not a lot, it
turns out. One thing you can't get at Carmine is a caliper test to
check body fat. I get one at the Printing House, and the trainer
informs me that I'm down to 11 percent. Sixteen percent is the goal
for men my age; 8 percent and I'm hanging with professional
athletes. I stumble back to Carmine, in wonder.
</P>
<P>
   After running four miles on the treadmill one day, I enter the
men's locker room to hear a male voice, unconscious of itself,
slowly croon the entirety of ``Amazing Grace.'' The voice, it turns
out, belongs to a scrawny guy who's changing in a corner. But all
about him, leaning against lockers, are huge athletes who have
ceased their trash talk for a moment to lend an ear. They nod
thoughtfully. The little guy sings. And I, for a glorious moment,
feel just like a citizen.

HILLARY CLINTON WRAPS UP FIRST BIG FORAY IN NEW YORK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME, N.Y. _ Ray Goppert II, a metalworks employee here, pressed
forward at the end of an roundtable discussion on the economic
future of the Mohawk Valley to hand his five-month-old son Ray III
to First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton cuddled the baby and swirled so that encircling news
photographers could take pictures.
</P>
<P>
   ``I brought the little guy today because I wanted to see if
there would be high-paying jobs around here when he's ready to go
to work,'' Goppert said later. ``Based on what I heard from Mrs.
Clinton, I just don't know if there will be the kind of jobs we
need to keep my son around here.''
</P>
<P>
   It was that kind of day as Clinton wrapped up her first solo
foray into the campaign for a Senate seat from New York Friday. She
listened politely, dutifully scribbled notes but ducked specifics
on hot-button issues.
</P>
<P>
   She heard plenty of complaints about this upstate New York
region that has been largely on the sidelines during the booming
1990s, but she offered few commitments.
</P>
<P>
   Anxious residents blamed the high costs of electrical power and
commercial air fares for discouraging businesses from relocating in
the region. They cited the flight of young workers to distant
employment, the inadequate training of high school graduates who
stay behind and the burdensome costs and regulations for old
buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of showing the detailed expertise on health care that
she exhibited while campaigning Thursday, Clinton stressed that she
needs to listen and learn about New York issues as she weighs a
final decision on whether to run.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is why I love these listening sessions,'' she said,
adding that New Yorkers were bringing issues that ``I never would
have known about that if you hadn't raised it.''
</P>
<P>
   Her lone campaign promise of the day was to support the
inclusion of New York state in the Northeast Dairy Compact, a
government-backed arrangement providing subsidies that help boost
milk prices for dairy farmers. She later stopped in Utica,
Syracuse, and the state's capital, Albany, before her scheduled
return to Washington, D.C. Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   In Utica she suggested a jobs fair to combat the flight of young
workers to employment elsewhere. The fair, she said, could help
graduating students find work nearby, using the theme: ``Bring it
home to the Mohawk Valley.''
</P>
<P>
   She also urged congressional passage of a White House plan to
underwrite the interest on school construction bonds nationwide. In
Utica, she said, that would help authorities complete a $45 million
state-of-the-art high school planned within an industrial park
created on the site of the decommissioned Griffiss Air Force Base.
</P>
<P>
   Looking weary on the third day of her exploratory Senate
campaign trip, Clinton pressed her audiences to explain the
economic stagnation that has left some communities along the Eire
Canal with high unemployment and vacant 19th century buildings
downtown.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have just been some reasons why upstate New York hasn't
had conditions to create the kind of jobs that the people here
deserve,'' Clinton told about 50 people gathered at the industrial
park
</P>
<P>
   F. Eugene Romano, 70, a Utica land developer, said the city's
crumbling facades look like ``a Jurassic Park for buildings'' that
scare away prospective investors. What's needed, he told Clinton,
is a government subsidy to cut the costs of demolition.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a really good idea,'' Clinton replied. ``But I'm not
familiar with that, and I will have to go back and look at this.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also asked why electric power costs New Yorkers about 30
percent more per kilowatt hour than the national average.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a little difficult to understand, given the
extraordinary hydro-power potential and opportunities for
competition that should be available,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Howard Wolfson, Clinton's campaign spokesman, said that the
first lady has steadily jotted notes of what people have told her
on her upstate New York tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``She will follow up with them and with other experts _ and
should she decide to run for the Senate, she will take positions on
those issues in the context of a campaign,'' Wolfson said.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday she is scheduled to return to the state for a
three-day tour of New York City, Westchester County and Long
Island.

   SPRAWL _ AUSTIN, Texas _ (first in an occasional series) Hoping
to tap into the increasingly large suburban portion of the
electorate, Vice President Al Gore is determined to make so-called
``urban sprawl'' a major issue in the 2000 presidential campaign.
After nearly a decade of economic growth, Gore is betting that
quality of life issues such as traffic and unfettered development _
traditionally dealt with on the local level _ will resonate in a
national campaign. There is evidence to support his strategy: More
than half of the nation's governors mentioned ``sprawl'' or ``Smart
Growth'' in their inaugural speeches. Texas Gov. George W. Bush,
Gore's likely opponent in the general election, wasn't one of them.
Although Austinites are all-too-familiar with development debates,
most famously independent Texans aren't too concerned _ although
that may be changing _ and Bush has been virtually mum on the
issue. What is Bush's view on sprawl? Does the federal government
have a legitimate role to play? (Greenberger, Austin

   OZONE _ WASHINGTON _ Scientists from the National Oceanic and

this month to monitor the level of ozone in the air in the region
of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park in Tennessee. The area
has been plagued with stubborn, health-threatening levels of
summertime photochemical smog for the last several years. Purpose
of the monitoring will be to develop more accurate forecasts so
susceptible people can be warned to stay away and to identify
sources, some of which may be distant pollution generators, NOAA
said. (Nesmith, Cox News Service).

synagogue on St. Thomas say the $350,000 renovation, due to begin

`MOVIE STARS' COULDA BEEN A CONTENDER _ OR COULD IT?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Movie Stars,'' airing at 8 p.m. CDT Sunday and Monday on WB,
is the kind of middling series whose likable characters inspire
good intentions, although not enough to overcome scripts stripped
bare of a comedy's essential element: laughs.
</P>
<P>
   Judging from the two episodes sent for review, this is one of
those underachieving sitcoms that's far less sophisticated than its
premise and press materials would have you believe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Movie Stars'' centers on life in a Hollywood family. Its
goals: to satirize the celebrity world and to show that its
inhabitants are just like the rest of us working stiffs. Next
week's episode, for example, deals with whether Marnette Patterson
(playing the same character she did in ``Something So Right'')
should attend the preppy rich kid's school or the arts magnet where
she'll be more in her element.
</P>
<P>
   Dad knows that the preppy school is the pipeline to Harvard and
Princeton, even though it spits out greedy robots wanting to make
their mark on ``their'' world without much regard for anyone else.
Public or private? What's a dad to do?
</P>
<P>
   Reese Hardin (Harry Hamlin) is the dad, a high-priced action
star married to Jacey Wyatt (Jennifer Grant, daughter of real-life
movie stars Dyan Cannon and the late Cary Grant), who's closing in
on her third Oscar nomination. The kicker here: Her passion is the
art of the film, his is the art of making billions on them.
</P>
<P>
   Throw in two young children, a cranky mother, the teen rebel and
Mark Benninghofen as Reese's complaining brother (he went to a
prestigious acting school but it's Reese's face and muscles that
count in Hollywood), and you've got TV's typical dysfunctional
family.
</P>
<P>
   They just happen to live in a spacious Malibu beach house and
drop names at every chance they get. Such as: ``Robin Williams is
driving the car pool today. I don't want him yelling at me in 27
wacky voices.'' Or this one: ``Call animal control. Adam Sandler's
going through the trash again.''
</P>
<P>
   Those are just two of the bombs featuring notables, like Michael
Douglas, Mel Gibson, Jennifer Lopez (she's sunbathing next door),
Drew Barrymore and Joe Pesci. (Reese tells his son to come ``save''
him at a kid's birthday party if Pesci starts talking to him.) And
that's all in the first episode.
</P>
<P>
   Another running gag is how the brothers of famous stars run in
packs. Here Joey Travolta, Don Swayze and Frank Stallone, real-life
brothers of the famous, spend time playing cards and whining about
their missed opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Travolta: ``You ever see my brother with a hairpiece? It's scary
how much we look alike.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Swayze does a, ahem, dirty dance move.
</P>
<P>
   See? More sad than clever.
</P>
<P>
   ``Movie Stars'' isn't on the fall schedule, and its chances of
survival are probably slim. In its defense, the subject of a movie
star family is one ripe with possibilities. Who knows what scripts
will come later down the line?
</P>
<P>
   On second thought ...

SINGLE TOWN'S GRAVES MAY CONTAIN 350 BODIES, NATO SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ War crimes investigators are looking into
reports that as many as 350 bodies may be buried in mass graves
near Ljubenic, in what would be the biggest concentration of
corpses found since the Kosovo air war ended last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are reports that these sites contain 350 bodies,'' said
Major Jan Joosten, a spokesman for Kosovo Force, or KFOR, in
Pristina. He said Italian forces _ who patrol the western Kosovo
area that includes Ljubenic _ and the International Criminal
Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia are investigating the reports.
</P>
<P>
   The site was closed to reporters Friday. But villagers
interviewed by the Globe a week ago described two separate
massacres by Serb forces in April, killings the villagers said
claimed at least 133 lives.
</P>
<P>
   The first assault came on April 1, when three Serb soldiers
forcibly gathered 80 men from the 2,000-population village and
machine-gunned them, survivors of the attack said.
</P>
<P>
   After separating out most of the men, the soldiers ordered the
women and children to go down to the main road toward Albania, said
Elhame Haradinaj, 33, whose father was killed in the attack.
</P>
<P>
   One man was executed as he walked down the village's main road
with his neighbors, witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
   As they headed down the road away from the village, the women
heard three series of gunfire: two short bursts and then a long,
sustained series of automatic weapon fire that lasted about five
minutes, Haradinaj said.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the village, the men were lined up and asked where their
weapons were, said Sadik Jahmurati, 47.
</P>
<P>
   Then, he said, Haradinaj's father, Adem Haradinaj, told the
soldiers, ``You took them last summer, the Serb police took them
last summer.'' One of the three soldiers responded, ``We are not
police. We are Yugoslav soldiers,'' and pumped several bullets into
Haradinaj's chest, ``killing him in front of us,'' Jahmurati
recalled.
</P>
<P>
   When a second man stepped forward to tell the soldiers the
village ``never made any trouble,'' he, too, was shot dead in front
of his neighbors, Jahmurati said.
</P>
<P>
   As the remaining men stood mute in fear, one of the three
soldiers turned to his fellow attackers and said, ``did you know my
brother was kidnapped by the KLA?'' referring to the ethnic
Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army that had mounted an armed
insurrection against Serb rule in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then, they started to execute us,'' swinging their machine
guns along the row of men, said Gani Bushati, who miraculously
survived the assault. He lifted his shirt and lowered his trousers
to display some of the 36 bullet wounds he suffered, which stitched
a horrifying, S-shaped pattern across his body.
</P>
<P>
   Eight men survived that attack by playing dead and crawled to
the woods for safety after the Serbs left.
</P>
<P>
   In a second attack on April 7, Serb forces gunned down villagers
from Ljubenic and surrounding mountain villages who were trying to
flee, said Sali Huskaj, who survived that assault.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs and villagers ``were shouting, and we saw them coming,
so we ran to escape,'' Huskaj said. Young men from Ljubenic said
they discovered 25 bodies, including 12 from one family, when they
trekked several hours into the mountains to look for missing
villagers.
</P>
<P>
   Ljubenic residents say they believe there are at least 60 bodies
in the mountains, based on the number of villagers they know are
missing.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, there were remains of what appeared to be two bodies
in the courtyard of a house near the site of the reported April 1
massacre. Locals say they think the rest of the bodies were burned
inside the house.
</P>
<P>
   Two more bodies were on the mountain, but the corpses were too
fresh to be victims of a months-old attack.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear Friday whether the suspected 350 corpses are from
the two reported massacres alone, or include victims of other,
nearby massacres.
</P>
<P>
   The area around western Kosovo _ especially around the city of
Pec _ is the region where the worst reported atrocities occurred.
The area was a fierce battleground between KLA and Serb forces near
the end of the war.

INTERIOR CHIEF DEFENDS RECORD ON INDIAN TRUST FUNDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt on Friday defended
his department's efforts to fix trust accounts created for the
benefit of American Indians, who have sued the government for
allegedly mismanaging or losing billions of dollars from the funds.
</P>
<P>
   The class-action lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court on behalf
of more than 300,000 Indians and 2,000 tribes seeks to compel the
government to fix a century-old trust fund system set up to manage
money earned from Indian-owned land.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs, led by Elouise Cobell, a member of the Blackfeet
tribe in Montana, contend in their 1994 lawsuit the government has
failed to ensure that profits from the land were properly
distributed to the Indian owners. They say Indians may be owned
more than $10 billion in lost payments.
</P>
<P>
   But Babbitt, questioned by a lawyer for the government, said he
has instituted plans to modernize the accounting system and that
the government was not guilty of breaking its trust relationship
with the Indians and the tribes.
</P>
<P>
   Although the government has conceded that some trust fund
accounts have been mismanaged in the past, Babbitt said it would be
a mistake to take responsibility for the program away from the
department's Bureau of Indian Affairs, which is overwhelmingly
staffed with Native Americans.
</P>
<P>
   He added that most Indian tribes, while frustrated by the
cumbersome bureaucracy, continue to favor keeping management of the
trust funds within the Bureau of Indian Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the love-hate relationship, they (the tribes) view the
Bureau of Indian Affairs as their imperfect piece of the
government,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The trust funds were created in the late 19th century when it
was national policy to break up reservations and parcel out tracts
of 80 or 160 acres to individual Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the land was rich in oil, timber, minerals or
agricultural products. The Bureau of Indian Affairs, acting as a
trustee for individual Indians, negotiated the sale of oil, trees,
ore or crops, and then collected the money on behalf of the
property owners. The agency was supposed to manage this task like a
trust officer at a local bank, always acting on behalf of the
landholder.
</P>
<P>
   But by the government's own admission, the bureau did not do a
good job in the past of managing the funds.
</P>
<P>
   A 1998 Interior Department report showed that more than 123,000
of the 340,000 individual Indian trust fund accounts lacked a
Social Security number or taxpayer identification number. At least
46,000 accounts were being held for Indians whose whereabouts were
unknown.
</P>
<P>
   In tens of thousands of cases, trust fund documents were shoved
into unmarked boxes and stored in barns or sheds, according to the
Interior Department.
</P>
<P>
   As the years passed, many of the documents were lost or
destroyed. One neglected warehouse in Albuquerque, N.M., eventually
became so rat-infested that officials entering the building in
search of trust documents needed to wear protective suits.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, several billion dollars may have been lost over the
years in undervalued and uncollected lease payments and in
destroyed or lost checks for Indian beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   A 1994 report conducted for the Interior Department by the
consulting firm Arthur Andersen said the Bureau of Indian Affairs
couldn't document $2.4 billion in tribal trust fund transactions.
Three years later, another report for the department by the
consulting firm Griffin &AMP; Associates warned that trust fund
problems and the class-action lawsuit ``may result in a potential
liability to the federal government so large that it is not
reasonably estimable.''
</P>
<P>
   During his testimony, Babbitt argued that the problems with the
trust funds go back decades and that he has made progress in
correcting them since he became secretary in 1993. Recently, the
Interior Department installed a $60 million computer system
designed to improve record keeping.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been doing the best we can as fast as we can,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the plaintiffs in the lawsuit contend that Babbitt has
stalled trust fund reform for years and only began to show interest
in the problem after the department was sued.
</P>
<P>
   ``Babbitt spent seven years in office denying justice to Indian
account holders and covering up his role in the debacle,'' Cobell
said.
</P>
<P>
   The government was expected to rest its case after Babbitt's
testimony, with both sides predicting the trial will wrap up next
week. U.S. District Judge Royce C. Lamberth then will decide how
much money is owed to the Indians and whether the Bureau of Indian
Affairs will continue to manage the trust accounts.
</P>
<P>
   In February, Lamberth held Babbitt and former Treasury Secretary
Robert Rubin in contempt of court for failing to turn over Indian
trust funds records sought by the plaintiffs.

SUBURBS AS CLUBS AND OTHER INSIGHTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, July 11, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Perhaps the most striking characteristic of the modern world is
its growing specialization and interdependence. There are more
technologies, more alliances, more jurisdictions, more side effects
and unintended consequences than a generation or two ago _ in
short, more possibilities for good and ill. It is all very well to
speak of growing complexity, but a time comes when you want a
little conceptual edge.
</P>
<P>
   A leading authority on the interrelationships among these
entities _ industries, alliances, jurisdictions, etc. _ the
burden-sharing within them and the spillovers between, in something
more than a textbook sense, is Todd Sandler.
</P>
<P>
   True, Sandler literally wrote (along with Richard Cornes) the
most popular university text concerned with these topics. ``The
Theory of Externalities, Public Goods and Club Goods'' describes
the framework with which economists and others analyze public
expenditures, including those made by the mutual benefit
associations that economists in the last 30 years have taken to
calling ``clubs'' -- toll roads, public utilities, suburbs,
colleges, defense alliances, and the like.
</P>
<P>
   But he has not stopped there. In ``Global Challenges: An
Approach to Environmental, Political and Economic Problems,''
published a couple of years ago, he demonstrated how a few basic
economic concepts _ spillovers, public goods, collective action _
could be employed to analyze the underlying similarities of a host
of problems: global warming, ozone depletion, acid rain, nuclear
waste disposal, international terrorism, disease eradication,
population growth, tropical deforestation, and peace-keeping.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Sandler's newest book, with Keith Hartley _ ``The
Political Economy of NATO'' _ was published on the day the bombing
started in Serbia. It is defense economics without algebra, says a
friend, tracing the alliance's mission from mutual assured
destruction, to flexible response, to peace-keeping. With the war
all but successfully concluded, Sandler says, ``My guess now is
that we're going to return to the days of the '50s and '60s, where
you've got three or four allies doing everything, with everybody
else free-riding.''
</P>
<P>
   As if to emphasize the relevance of the approach, the United
Nations Development Program in May published a survey volume,
``Global Public Goods: International Cooperation in the 21st
Century,'' arguing that such goods are systematically
underprovided. For some years the UNDP has been the leading edge of
cosmopolitan progressive dogma _ for example, five years ago it
produced the annual ``Human Development Report,'' with its emphasis
on individual capabilities designed to contrast with the World
Bank's more traditional ``World Development Report.''
</P>
<P>
   The set-up chapter of the new report _ on ``intergenerational''
public goods, complete with a mammoth characteristics-based
taxonomy of them _ is by Sandler.
</P>
<P>
   It is all a long way from Pleasantville, the New York City
suburb where he grew up. Indeed, the Sandler story is testimony to
the extensive network of competitive educational institutions that
are unique to the United States. Sandler learned his economics at
the Binghamton campus of the State University of New York, then
taught at a series of out-back schools including Arizona State
University and the University of Wyoming before winding up
distinguished professor of economics and political science at Iowa
State University in Ames. He is a frequent visitor to universities
abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I liked the relevance (of economics). I liked being able to
use it to my advantage. I have a 10-year-old son, he sometimes
travels with me, we were in Prague, and it started to rain. I
hailed a cab, but my son said we should walk back to the subway, it
would be a lot cheaper. I said, no, cabs will be cheap here. It
came and it was very cheap, a couple of dollars for a long ride.
</P>
<P>
   ``He kept pumping me in the hotel afterwards, how did you know
that? I said, in any city where you can ride the subway for three
cents from one end of town to the other, you can be darn sure that
taxis would have to be quite competitive to survive. Opportunity
cost and all that.''
</P>
<P>
   Sandler's big break came in 1981, when he spent a year in
Australia and teamed up with Richard Cornes, then at Australian
National Universit. The pair wrote five papers in four months.
``We had trememdous difficulty in getting them published at first.
That's usually the case. . .. The comments were clearly incorrect,
so we persevered. We fixed the papers to say, `one shouldn't think
this-and-such,' then we played a kind of musical chairs. We
switched them around, and on the second go, they were all accepted.
The issue had to do with how to teach the fundamental distinctions
between public and private goods that had been spelled out earlier
by Nobel laureate Paul Samuelson.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that point it was clear to us that we had come up with such
a different way of analyzing public goods that it was going to
catch on in a big way. We managed to strip the model down to four
elements, so that the mathematics was extremely simple. We came up
with a new way of visualizing it graphically. Once you build a
theory on such a simple and elementary framework, your ability to
extend it and apply it is almost limitless. We already had these
five papers. We said let's put it into text form.'' The result is
not deep, at least by the standards of Sandler's colleagues on the
research frontier, but broad: a highly serviceable map of one of
the most important territories in economics.
</P>
<P>
   Cornes's and Sandler's text has doubled in size since it first
appeared in 1986. Much of the new material concerns the theory of
clubs, which traces its origins to an argument among economists in
the 1920s about the pricing of congested roads. In 1957, Charles
Tiebout made a powerful case for how local jurisdictions such as
suburbs could be shaped by consumers who shopped among them for the
best public services. Only after James Buchanan and Mancur Olson in
the mid-1960s published formal analyses did the study of clubs take
off. Today, it is one of the most active topics in mathematical
economics _ and a source of much policy research as well.
</P>
<P>
   Next on Sandler's agenda is a primer on economic concepts for
the intelligent layperson. ``I hope instead of buying one of Paul
Krugman's books for an airplane trip, that they will consider
buying mine,'' says Sandler. ``I do think people want to have a
sense of what has been the economic revolution in this century and
what's going to happen in economics in the coming years. I know
what my colleagues are going to say, that I'm a popularizer now.
But I still do the stuff out in infinite space.''

DRIVER IN TRAIN-TRUCK COLLISION RAN STOP SIGN, AUTHORITIES SAY &HT;   
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   &HT;    By PATTY REINERT
 &HT;    c.1999 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ A tanker truck driver ran a stop sign just before
crossing into the path of the Amtrak passenger train that derailed
west of here, injuring 21 people, authorities said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did not see the stop sign but did see the train and then
tried to brake,'' said Texas Department of Public Safety spokesman
Tom Vinger. ``It was way too late.''
</P>
<P>
   Vinger said the truck driver, Jason David Bubela, 21, of El
Campo, would likely be charged with a misdemeanor traffic violation
_ either failure to yield for a train or disregarding a stop sign _
in connection with the accident near Eagle Lake.
</P>
<P>
   Troopers also are investigating possible violations for failure
to keep a log book and for operating a truck with faulty brakes.
The charges are expected within the next two weeks, Vinger said.
</P>
<P>
   Bubela, a driver for Key Energy Services of Bryan-College
Station, was not seriously injured in the wreck with the eastbound
Sunset Limited, which occurred just before noon Thursday. The
company's lawyer, Jack Loftis, declined to discuss the
investigation, citing a request by the National Transportation
Safety Board. He said Bubela would not be available for an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   The train, en route from Los Angeles to Orlando, Fla., was
carrying 234 passengers and crew members, 21 of whom were treated
for mostly minor injuries at Rice Medical Center in Eagle Lake,
about 65 miles west of Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Four of the injured, including engineer J.D. Woods and his
assistant engineer, Ed Guidon, spent the night in the hospital but
were released by Friday afternoon, hospital administrator David
Keith said.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Woods, 50, of San Antonio, and Guidon, 34, of La Place, La.,
were pulled from the overturned engine Thursday after rescuers used
a sledgehammer to break a window.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were in the front car, so they were banged up pretty
bad,'' Keith said. ``They're going to be awfully sore for a while,
but they mostly have bumps and bruises. We were concerned that
there might be internal bleeding, but we've ruled that out.''
</P>
<P>
   Amtrak officials declined to allow their employees to be
interviewed.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   NTSB officials arrived in Eagle Lake on Friday to begin their
investigation of the wreck. Spokesman Keith Hollaway said
investigators had recovered the ``black box,'' which contains a
recording of the train's operations, and sent it to Washington for
review by crash experts.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Davis, a spokesman for Union Pacific, which owns the
tracks, said crews worked throughout the night to clean up about
2,000 gallons of diesel fuel spilled from the train and to replace
800 feet of rail. The tracks were reopened at 8:30 a.m. Friday, he
said.

   ``The Way People Run''
</P>
<P>
   By Christopher Tilghman
</P>
<P>
   Category: Short Fiction
</P>
<P>
   Random House, $21.95
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Why people run is because family crises eject them from the big,
stinking cities where they have lucrative jobs and complicated
lives.
</P>
<P>
   Where people run is to the countryside. There, everything is
clean. Country people have straightened out their priorities
without even trying. Everything becomes clear: Cities stink and
lucrative jobs gut your soul.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Tilghman says these things over and over in his
second collection of short fiction, called ``The Way People Run.''
He says it in tangled stories about people who imagine they know
each other so well they don't bother to understand one another.
Excruciating loneliness ensues. People run to the country.
</P>
<P>
   John Steinbeck said it shorter and better, in his fable of an
animal that attempts to make a homestead outside the fruitful but
dangerous garden.
</P>
<P>
   But if you like your psychological fiction stuffed full of
self-inflicted pain and suffering, and with more layers than
homemade baklava, check out ``The Way People Run.''
</P>
<P>
   About that title: The way people run is scared, mostly. And
Tilghman nails it to the wall. In ``The Late Night News,'' he
crafts an ice-cold description of the suffering that can lead
strong people to alcoholism: ``Long ago Martin had learned that
loneliness was like all other kinds of pain: endurable if you knew
it would get no worse and if you could be certain that it would
someday stop. ... It could get a lot worse, this hollowness; he was
just standing at the edge, looking into the pit, and it was a
dangerous place to be, he knew that. The liquid voices were
inviting him to jump in: You'll love it! You can't imagine how good
permanent self-pity can feel! What else do you have on your
calendar? One of these days, perhaps tonight, perhaps even this
second, he would have to make a decision; his life was in his hands
like a folded shadow; he was terrified of the dark.''
</P>
<P>
   The author builds haystacks of familial guilt that threaten to
suffocate character and reader alike. Then, faster than your best
friend can recite your failings, he scythes through the chaff to a
kernel of human truth. Consider this, from ``A Suitable Good-Bye'':
``He found pleasure in nourishing this child, and understood for
the first time those looks of supreme contentment on the faces of
mothers when their children were eating a good supper.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a fine premise, this running from the rat race to something
better. Perhaps it does bear repeating many times.

CLINTON SAYS REPUBLICANS ARE BEHOLDEN TO HEALTH INSURANCE INDUSTRY &HT;   
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   &HT;    By NANCY MATHIS
 &HT;    c.1999 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ President Clinton accused congressional
Republicans Friday of being beholden to the health insurance
industry in its &UR;  &LR; efforts to kill Democrat-backed legislation that
would establish a bill of rights for patients.
</P>
<P>
   The president also moved to counter an advertising campaign by
the legislation's opponents in which they claim the Democratic bill
will drive up insurance costs. He contended Americans would be
willing to pay &UR;  &LR; the extra $1 a month to ensure quality medical care
for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to put people and principle and evidence ahead of raw
political influence,'' Clinton told medical personnel at the
Harbor-UCLA Medical Center in nearby Torrance.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton again pressed the issue as the Senate prepares to open
debate next week. Republican leaders have decided to allow the
Democrats to bring up their measure, but in the end likely will
offer the GOP alternative and pass it instead. The plan would
bypass individual votes on sensitive issues.
</P>
<P>
   The president said when he read of the Republican strategy, ``I
thought to myself, what kind of a weird world am I living in? This
is about whether some people live or some people die. This is not a
typical political decision. This is about life and the quality of
life and the fundamental decency of our society.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic bill would force health maintenance organizations
and other managed care companies to allow patients the right to
specialists, to emergency care, to retain the same doctor
throughout treatment, and to file lawsuits when the refusal for
services results in damages.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican version is less expansive and less expensive, but
Democrats complain it denies patients the right to sue and excludes
100 million people.
</P>
<P>
   The president said the drive for profits at the expense of
patient care mandates that Congress act. He said horror stories of
patients denied treatment and access to specialists are not
isolated events but signs of systemic problems.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has used his executive order to extend much of the
Democratic proposal to the government's federal employees as well
as Medicare and Medicaid patients. He said the experience so far
for federal workers is their insurance increased by $1 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said HMOs are attempting to scare healthy clients into
thinking they would pay more for coverage to cover the sick
patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to ask every American if he or she wouldn't be
willing to pay something in that range on the off chance that their
healthy self might not always be that way,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents to the legislation have launched a $750,000
advertising campaign to try to sway undecided senators.
</P>
<P>
   The president maintained the Democratic plan has the support of
70 percent of the Republicans, Democrats and independents in the
country. There are more than 200 medical and consumer groups also
backing it.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made his address a day after completing a tour of
impoverished regions in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, he headed out for a round of golf. The president
decided to stay in California, borrowing the estate of supermarket
magnate Ron Burkle, in order to watch the Women's World Cup soccer
match Saturday between the United States and China.

RESHAPING SOCIETY THROUGH PEOPLE POWER 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DAVID BORNSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Twenty years ago social activists could identify only one
independent organization working to protect the environment in
Indonesia. Today there are more than 2,000, an environmental
network based in Jakarta reports.
</P>
<P>
   Citizen organizations have been similarly emerging across much
of the world. In Slovakia, there were a handful of such
organizations active in the 1980's; now there are more than 10,000.
In the Philippines, registered nonprofit organizations grew from
18,000 to 58,000 between 1989 and 1996. And in the United States,
aside from religious groups and private foundations, 70 percent of
nonprofit organizations filing returns with the IRS are less than
30 years old; a third are less than 15.
</P>
<P>
   To some economists and social scientists, the astonishing growth
of citizen-led organizations signals a new kind of global
revolution. ``It is reshaping politics and economics both at the
domestic and global levels,'' said Lester M. Salamon, the director
of the Center for Civil Society Studies at Johns Hopkins
University. ``I believe it is as important a development to the
latter part of the 20th century as the rise of the nation-state was
at the end of the 19th century.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider recent events in which citizens' groups were major
players: the defeat of apartheid in South Africa; the end of the
dictatorship in Chile; the political transformation in the
Philippines; the overthrow of communist regimes in Central Europe;
the creation of an international treaty prohibiting land mines; the
establishment of an international criminal court.
</P>
<P>
   Organizations founded by private individuals have historically
played a vital role in democracies. Writing in the 1830s, Alexis de
Tocqueville remarked that nothing was more deserving of attention
than America's associations. Women's suffrage, organized labor,
civil rights, consumer protection, environmental protection, gay
liberation and the rights of the disabled are all movements
pioneered by citizen organizations.
</P>
<P>
   What is different today, however, is not only the increasing
number of these groups worldwide, but also the view that they are a
distinct sector, one that, like government, serves essential social
functions, but that has many of the entrepreneurial qualities of
business. The profit, in this case, is primarily social progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``This new sector really is competitive like business,'' said
William Drayton, the president of Ashoka, an organization (named
for an altruistic ruler of India in the 3rd century B.C.) that
supports people working to bring about social changes in Asia,
Africa, Latin America and Central Europe. ``It's got open entry.
Organizations are competing for money, for recognition, for
staff.''
</P>
<P>
   Drayton and others hold that the citizen sector is leading the
social half of society through the same type of changes that
transformed the European economy three centuries ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the early business environment, the right to conduct
different businesses was given by the crown,'' said Sharon Oster, a
professor of economics at the Yale School of Management. ``That
monopoly model fell apart and became a competitive model.'' As
controls on economic enterprises were loosened in the 17th and 18th
centuries, new players flooded the field of business.
</P>
<P>
   Just as trade and manufacturing were monopolized centuries ago,
colonial and authoritarian governments pretty much monopolized the
social arena. The viceroys in India, the communists in Central
Europe the generals in Latin America and Africa had little
tolerance for citizens who tried to engineer broad social change.
</P>
<P>
   As colonies gained independence and democracy spread,
opportunities opened up for what Drayton called social
entrepreneurs. These people, he said, have vision, practical
ability and drive, they cannot rest until they have solved social
problems not just locally, but systemwide. Think of Florence
Nightingale, who developed modern nursing; Ralph Nader, who
pioneered the consumer movement, or Muhammad Yunus, who founded the
Grameen Bank in Bangladesh and spread the idea of microcredit _
small loans to fight poverty _ around the world.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, such breakthrough movements as Gandhian
self-reliance and nonviolence, civil rights, liberation theology
and feminism have helped prime hundreds of millions of people for
social engagement. And the growth of the middle class has increased
the pool of potential recruits.
</P>
<P>
   Drayton sought to catalyze the citizen sector by adapting the
venture-capital approach. The idea was to search for budding
innovators to supply them with seed money and connect them in a
global fellowship. In 1980 he created Ashoka, which has its
headquarters in Arlington, Va., and now supports nearly 1,000
social entrepreneurs in 33 countries. Among them are Vera Cordeiro
and Wojciech Onyszkiewicz. Ms. Cordeiro has built a program in Rio
de Janeiro to help prevent recurring illnesses by providing
post-hospitalization assistance to poor children and their
families. Onyszkiewicz built an unusual food bank in Poland,
through an exchange in which farmers donate food to the urban poor
and rural children are taken on educational trips to Warsaw.
</P>
<P>
   Drayton said that the business sector had grown in productivity
because it developed a beneficial competitive approach that
rewarded innovation. He believes competition in the social sector
could generate the same kinds of productivity increases.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``When there is a critical mass of institutions, people and
ideas, and they feed on one another and strengthen one another, the
competitive revolution begins to set in,'' Drayton said. ``You
begin to get a culture that says: `This is great. We're proud to be
doing this. We admire people who do this well. We reward them.' It
happened in business and it's exactly what you're seeing at the
moment in the citizen sector.''
</P>
<P>
   J. Gregory Dees, who teaches social entrepreneurship at the
Graduate School of Business at Stanford University, said: ``I'm
seeing two broad trends. One is a shift away from the idea of this
sector being primarily about charity and the transfer of wealth to
being about a desire to find more systemic and sustained solutions
to social problems. And the other is an increased openness to
experimenting with business methods and market-based approaches.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, donors are more apt to stop financing organizations
that cannot demonstrate their effectiveness. Some winning ideas, on
the other hand, are rewarded. The Grameen Bank and the Bangladesh
Rural Advancement Committee, a citizen organization, have been so
successful in alleviating poverty and educating millions of
villagers that they have attracted hundreds of millions of dollars
of financing from around the globe. More than a thousand
development programs worldwide are emulating their experiences.
</P>
<P>
   Some activists fear too much competition, arguing that groups
can be more effective by forming coalitions. ``We need to find
better ways to cooperate with one another if we are going to
advocate effectively,'' said Laurie Regelbrugge, the chief
operating officer of Civicus, an international network of citizen
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Nalebuff, a management professor at the Yale School of
Management, points to a different kind of problem: that growth does
not necessarily lead to productivity gains unless accompanied by
market discipline. ``There are too many nonprofits today and the
reason is simply the difficulty in getting them to merge,''
Nalebuff said. ``In the for-profit sector, if an organization is
doing poorly, somebody can take it over. There is no such thing as
a nonfriendly acquisition in this sector. You need to be in
bankruptcy before you lose control, the result being that we have
much redundancy.''
</P>
<P>
   And Christine Letts, executive director of the Hauser Center for
Nonprofit Organizations at Harvard, said that to deliver the goods
_ i.e., social change _ ``at a cost that is appropriate for its
performance,'' this new sector needs to develop better information
systems and standards. ``The issue is how much is wasted,'' she
added.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the advocates are optimistic. ``There has been a general
questioning of the capacity of the state to carry out a whole host
of functions,'' Salamon said. ``This sector represents another way
of organizing the common business of society.''
</P>
<P>
   Past experience and a faster rate of change mean that in 20
years the citizen sector ``will be almost unrecognizably more
mature,'' Drayton said. ``Many of the institutions that took
business 300 years to develop will be well on their way to
development,'' he predicted.  &QL;

JAPAN TO SUPPORT CHINA'S BID TO JOIN WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By SETH FAISON    c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Chinese Prime Minister Zhu Rongji and Japanese Prime
Minister Keizo Obuchi met here Friday and announced that they had
reached a trade agreement that effectively won Japan's endorsement
for China to join the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, limited in substance to a handful of minor trade
issues, carried weighty implications. China is eager to join the
group that makes the rules of global commerce, and has courted
support from many of its 134 member countries. At the same time,
its chess game of negotiations with Washington _ essentially the
arbiter of China's efforts to join the WTO _ remains at an impasse.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement announced Friday is unlikely to have a direct
impact on China's negotiations with the United States, which
stalled after NATO's bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade in
May prompted violent demonstrations here and a diplomatic crisis
with Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Yet one potent hint emerged Friday, sure to attract the
attention of U.S. officials scouring China's political landscape
for clues over how to break the stalemate. It was the comment,
which a senior Japanese official attributed to Zhu, that China
would not withdraw the concessions that were offered to the United
States when Zhu visited in April.
</P>
<P>
   China's official accounts of the meeting did not confirm the
remark, so U.S. negotiators are unlikely to be able to test Zhu's
sincerity until they actually sit down again with Chinese
counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   But the United States was clearly irked by the Japan-China
agreement. In the view of U.S. officials, Japan makes few demands
of China _ knowing that whatever concessions the United States wins
will also apply to China's other trading partners, Japan included.
In other words, Japan can win diplomatic points with China, without
losing any trade advantages.
</P>
<P>
   ``By and large, the Japanese have not contributed sufficiently
to the creation of a commercially meaningful agreement,'' said U.S.
Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky in Washington on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials have said repeatedly that the key to resolving
remaining differences is whether Beijing will keep the concessions
that Zhu previously had offered, or whether in Friday's distinctly
cooler political atmosphere those concessions will become
untenable.
</P>
<P>
   Zhu and his colleagues were surprised and angered when U.S.
trade officials publicized the concessions China had made privately
in Washington. But they apparently felt doubly betrayed when
President Clinton personally vetoed a deal that his own negotiators
were almost ready to sign.
</P>
<P>
   After all that, persuading Chinese negotiators not to rescind
any of their concessions was going to be a challenge, U.S.
officials admitted. After the bombing, efforts to negotiate fell
apart entirely.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Zhu kept to the position that Beijing will not resume
talks with the United States until it gets a better explanation for
the bombing of the embassy. NATO has said it was a mistake that
followed a series of coincidental failures of intelligence and
planning, an explanation Chinese leaders have rejected as
implausible.
</P>
<P>
   The political complexities of WTO membership extend through
China's leadership. Some senior officials, fearful that state-owned
industries will be damaged by the open markets that membership
would require, have expressed opposition to China's entry.
</P>
<P>
   Zhu, vulnerable to accusations that he gave away too much during
his visit to the United States, is believed to have fended off
internal attacks on his pro-membership position. But if months go
by, and Beijing refuses to resume talks with the United States, it
may damage his authority.
</P>
<P>
   The working deadline for an agreement is Nov. 30, when a new
round of global trade talks begins in Seattle. If no agreement is
reached by then, China's efforts to join the world trade body may
be delayed for several years.
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi, apparently looking for a diplomatic achievement to crown
his visit, expressed the desire that Japan's agreement would affect
China's talks with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope that the bilateral settlement will lead to an impetus
for new China-U.S. talks,'' Obuchi said Friday night, completing a
two-day visit here. ``It is our desire to see China enter the WTO
by the end of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   Japan's agreement with China on Friday covered the services
sector, including telecommunications, construction, distribution
and financial services. The deal, Japanese officials said,
complements a 1997 agreement on commodities trade between the two
biggest trading partners in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Jun Yokota, deputy director general for economic affairs in the
Japanese Foreign Ministry, told reporters that China had asked to
keep the contents of the deal secret, and that Japan had agreed.

 HILLARY CLINTON WRAPS UP FIRST BIG FORAY IN NEW YORK   (EDs: FIXES
lede, changing an to a)

<P>
   ROME, N.Y. _ Ray Goppert II, a metalworks employee here, pressed
forward at the end of a roundtable discussion on the economic
future of the Mohawk Valley to hand his five-month-old son Ray III
to First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton cuddled the baby and swirled so that encircling news
photographers could take pictures.
</P>
<P>
   ``I brought the little guy today because I wanted to see if
there would be high-paying jobs around here when he's ready to go
to work,'' Goppert said later. ``Based on what I heard from Mrs.
Clinton, I just don't know if there will be the kind of jobs we
need to keep my son around here.''
</P>
<P>
   It was that kind of day as Clinton wrapped up her first solo
foray into the campaign for a Senate seat from New York Friday. She
listened politely, dutifully scribbled notes but ducked specifics
on hot-button issues.
</P>
<P>
   She heard plenty of complaints about this upstate New York
region that has been largely on the sidelines during the booming
1990s, but she offered few commitments.
</P>
<P>
   Anxious residents blamed the high costs of electrical power and
commercial air fares for discouraging businesses from relocating in
the region. They cited the flight of young workers to distant
employment, the inadequate training of high school graduates who
stay behind and the burdensome costs and regulations for old
buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of showing the detailed expertise on health care that
she exhibited while campaigning Thursday, Clinton stressed that she
needs to listen and learn about New York issues as she weighs a
final decision on whether to run.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is why I love these listening sessions,'' she said,
adding that New Yorkers were bringing issues that ``I never would
have known about that if you hadn't raised it.''
</P>
<P>
   Her lone campaign promise of the day was to support the
inclusion of New York state in the Northeast Dairy Compact, a
government-backed arrangement providing subsidies that help boost
milk prices for dairy farmers. She later stopped in Utica,
Syracuse, and the state's capital, Albany, before her scheduled
return to Washington, D.C. Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   In Utica she suggested a jobs fair to combat the flight of young
workers to employment elsewhere. The fair, she said, could help
graduating students find work nearby, using the theme: ``Bring it
home to the Mohawk Valley.''
</P>
<P>
   She also urged congressional passage of a White House plan to
underwrite the interest on school construction bonds nationwide. In
Utica, she said, that would help authorities complete a $45 million
state-of-the-art high school planned within an industrial park
created on the site of the decommissioned Griffiss Air Force Base.
</P>
<P>
   Looking weary on the third day of her exploratory Senate
campaign trip, Clinton pressed her audiences to explain the
economic stagnation that has left some communities along the Eire
Canal with high unemployment and vacant 19th century buildings
downtown.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have just been some reasons why upstate New York hasn't
had conditions to create the kind of jobs that the people here
deserve,'' Clinton told about 50 people gathered at the industrial
park
</P>
<P>
   F. Eugene Romano, 70, a Utica land developer, said the city's
crumbling facades look like ``a Jurassic Park for buildings'' that
scare away prospective investors. What's needed, he told Clinton,
is a government subsidy to cut the costs of demolition.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a really good idea,'' Clinton replied. ``But I'm not
familiar with that, and I will have to go back and look at this.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also asked why electric power costs New Yorkers about 30
percent more per kilowatt hour than the national average.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a little difficult to understand, given the
extraordinary hydro-power potential and opportunities for
competition that should be available,'' Clinton said.

<P>
   Howard Wolfson, Clinton's campaign spokesman, said that the
first lady has steadily jotted notes of what people have told her
on her upstate New York tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``She will follow up with them and with other experts _ and
should she decide to run for the Senate, she will take positions on
those issues in the context of a campaign,'' Wolfson said.

   MUZAFFARABAD, Kashmir _ Six holy warriors were buried here
Friday beside an apricot tree in Martyr's Square. Their bodies did
not require any of the usual ritual washing or the cover of a white
shroud. They were placed in their graves just as they had fallen,
martyrs already ascended into heaven.
</P>
<P>
   The young men were blown apart in battle by artillery fire a few
miles from here. They were not well known, but 2,000 people came to
their funeral under a brutal morning sun. Martyrdom is treated
quite momentously in this city. The special burial plot lies before
the National Assembly and beside the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Muzaffarabad is the capital of what is known in Pakistan as
Azad, or liberated, Kashmir; the Indians know it as
Pakistan-occupied territory. Outside of town, along a route that
winds through the breathtaking green of the lower Himalayas, the
same hand-lettered words appear again and again on rocky walls
beside the road: Martyrdom is our motto.
</P>
<P>
   As the ``Kargil jihad,'' the two-month war for strategic
mountain tops in the area that India controls, was being celebrated
in Muzaffarabad, it was being deflated 80 miles away in Islamabad,
the Pakistani capital. Fulfilling a pledge made by Prime Minister
Nawaz Sharif last weekend in Washington, the Pakiani government
officially appealed to the Mujahideen, or holy warriors, to end the
fighting on the windswept peaks.
</P>
<P>
   Sharif had met for two hours with his top military and civilian
leaders. Afterward, in a statement, the group asked the militants
to pull back to ``provide an opportunity for the international
community to play an active role'' in solving the 52-year-old
dispute over Kashmir. Foreign Secretary Shamshad Ahmed Khan
emphasized that President Clinton had promised ``to take a personal
interest.''
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister then met with a delegation of Mujahideen
groups. Some later took a wait-and-see attitude while others
rebuffed his entreaty outright. ``We don't accept any Washington
accord and are not concerned with appeals from the government of
Pakistan,'' said Abdul Ahad, a spokesman for Al-Badr Mujahideen.
</P>
<P>
   The funeral in Muzaffarabad itself seemed a flat rejection of
Sharif's proposal. ``We started the holy war based on our trust in
God, not the governments of Pakistan or the United States,'' said
Ahmed Hamza of Al-Badr Mujahideen, addressing the crowd.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Five of the coffins rested on the ground together. The dead
belonged to the group Tehrik-e-Jihad. Dozens of its soldiers, in
camouflage fatigues with long-tailed kufiya atop their heads,
marched with precision. Before any prayers were recited, speeches
were made, amplified through a sound truck. Mourning was secondary
to exhortation.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the will of Allah, we will start dozens of Kargils,'' said
Saleem Wani, a leader of the Tehrik-e-Jihad.
</P>
<P>
   A chant began in response. ``God is great!''
</P>
<P>
   For weeks, India has been portraying the Mujahideen as rather
feckless rebels being led into battle by Pakistani army regulars.
Each day in New Delhi, the military announces a new string of
victories and a lopsided death toll.
</P>
<P>
   In Muzaffarabad, that claim is turned inside out. The Mujahideen
claim that the holy war is entirely their own, and the Pakistanis
mere allies. As for how the fighting is going, they say the Indians
are taking a drubbing.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Indians boasts were truth, the war would be over,
wouldn't it?'' said Nazir Hussain Shah, 30, a Mujahideen soldier on
leave. ``We are Kashmiris and these mountains are our homes. We are
used to fighting up here. We took those peaks in February, in the
most bitter part of winter, and we are completely prepared to stay
when winter comes again.''
</P>
<P>
   However the Kargil campaign turns out, it would seem the
Mujahideen struggle for Kashmir is destined for a long life. It
combines the patriot's love of a land with the religious zealot's
sense of righteousness and the oppressed's storehouse of hatred.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the men buried Friday _ Mohammad Aslam Shah, Nazir
Ahmed Qureshi and Altaf Ahmed Shah _ came from families that had
fled Indian Kashmir in 1990 and ended up in the Ambor refugee camp
outside Muzaffarabad.
</P>
<P>
   Ambor, once seen as a stopover, is now a settlement, its 3,000
residents having gouged space out of a mountainside and piled hovel
atop hovel. Steep paths, barely two feet wide, divide one row of
single-room homes from another. The better-off have tin roofs, but
most people live under ill-fitting wooden planks. At any given
time, hundreds of the young men are fighting the jihad. Every house
has someone who has lost a husband, a child or a limb.
</P>
<P>
   In Altaf Ahmed Shah's house, grieving uncles and cousins were
repeating tales of Indian ``tortures and atrocities'' that had
driven them from the village of Karnah Bahadur Kot nine years ago.
Noor Ali Shah had embarked on the story of his missing right leg
when a very old man began to shout and ambled in, poking with a
cane.
</P>
<P>
   With skinny legs and a stooped frame, Kapur Ali Shah, who said
he was 120 years old, looked like a slowly moving question mark.
``Since 1947, we have been asking for our independence,'' he
screamed as people reached to steady him. ``We have asked for it
and asked for it and asked for it. We ask for it still!''
</P>
<P>
   In 1947, the year that India and Pakistan were carved from the
British Empire, the two infant nations went to war over the jeweled
land that lay between them. Kashmir, predominantly Muslim, seemed
essential to both of their identities _ proof that secular India
could accommodate all faiths, and proof that Pakistan was the
Islamic homeland for the region.
</P>
<P>
   A half century and two other wars later, Kashmir remains the
chief issue that keeps both countries loathing the other. Pakistan
controls about a third of Kashmir as a protectorate; the Indian
state of Jammu and Kashmir includes most of the rest.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, a violent separatist movement shook Indian Kashmir. The
Indians blamed the Pakistanis for fomenting the rebellion. The
Pakistanis and many human rights groups blamed the Indians for
stifling dissent and insurrection in a brutal manner.
</P>
<P>
   Khanum Jan, the mother of Nazir Ahmed Qureshi, one of those
buried Friday, said she lost another son, her eldest, during the
violence in 1990. She has one son left. ``All my boys are willing
to die for the struggle,'' she said in a low murmur.
</P>
<P>
   Mohammad Aslam Shah was also the second son in his family to be
``martyred.'' Maskeen Shah, his father, Friday recalled what had
made him flee to Azad Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our women were raped,'' he said. ``They tear-gassed us. They
shot at us. The looted our properties. I was tortured with
electricity, strung upside down.''
</P>
<P>
   He sat cross-legged on the floor and as he talked his lips
trembled and his eyes got teary. But he refused to accept
condolences.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a happy man today,'' he insisted. ``The title of
martyrdom does not come easily. And I am proud of my son for dying
for our cause.''
</P>
<P>
   He reached out his left arm and pulled a baby onto his lap. The
boy, his grandson, is 5 months old and now fatherless.
</P>
<P>
   ``Soon,'' he said, propping the baby onto his toes and forcing a
smile, ``this little one will be ready for jihad.''

<P>
   During her life Wanda Landowska was quick to claim credit for
rescuing the harpsichord from the oblivion it had fallen into by
the late 19th century. At the beginning of the 20th century,
virtually the only place one could find a harpsichord was in a
museum, a musically useless artifact next to other furniture and
relics of the Baroque era.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Landowska exaggerated her role. But not by much, as an
informative and entertaining hourlong documentary, ``Landowska:
Uncommon Visionary,'' which will be broadcast Sunday at 7 p.m. on
PBS, makes clear.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Warsaw in 1879 to a cultivated family, Landowska was
instinctively drawn to Bach, whose keyboard works, when heard at
all, were performed on the piano from historically compromised
transcriptions. She was determined to perform Bach and
then-forgotten Baroque masters like Couperin on the instrument of
their own time, but she encountered fierce opposition, even from
those who should have been allies, like the scholar and composer
Charles Bordes, a colleague in Paris in the early 1900s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Play all the works of the harpsichordists,'' Bordes wrote to
her. ``But not on the harpsichord. Enough of that cage for flies
which reduces works that are superb to the size of its little
spindly legs.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite such thinking, Landowska persuaded the Paris piano firm
of Pleyel to build a harpsichord to her specifications. The
resulting instrument, though not particularly historic according to
today's understanding, was a big-toned, double-keyboard,
magnificent thing incorporating some aspects of the piano. She
first performed on it in 1912 and, taking it everywhere _ on and
off trains and coaches, in an out of concert salons _ she slowly
won her campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Once, after hearing her perform in Moscow, Tolstoy's wife begged
her to come to the great author and music enthusiast's estate
outside the city to play for him. On her way, with a second sled
carrying her instrument, she got stuck in a terrible snowstorm, as
she relates in some clips from a 1953 television interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was impetuous, I was young and I jumped from the sled. And I
was still here'' _ holding her hand above her mouth _ ``in the
snow. And my nose, my big nose has saved me the life.'' There are
some wonderful film clips of Tolstoy at his estate around the time
of Landowska's visit.
</P>
<P>
   The documentary's most touching segments are the interviews with
Landowska's longtime companion, Denise Restout, who came to her as
a student in 1933. Landowska's personal life was unorthodox and,
for her time, quietly defiant.
</P>
<P>
   In 1900 she impulsively married a charming ethnologist, Henry
Lew, an authority on Hebrew folklore, who wound up organizing her
growing concert activities. But Landowska did not have enough time
for her art and her marital duties, especially the romantic ones.
So she enlisted help in both areas from an efficient young German
housekeeper, Elsa Schunicke, who remained with her even after her
husband's accidental death in 1919.
</P>
<P>
   But from 1933 until her death in 1959, Landowska and Ms. Restout
lived together happily, first in Paris and finally in Lakeville,
Conn., which became a living shrine to Landowska for her students
and disciples. In a lovely segment, Ms. Restout proudly shows off
the red velvet concert gown and matching shoes that Landowska wore
every time she performed Bach's Goldberg Variations, a monumental
work she essentially introduced in the 1930s to a public largely
unaware of its existence.
</P>
<P>
   The documentary is less good at giving a sense of how
Landowska's artistry is viewed today. John Pfeiffer, her record
producer at RCA Victor, explains that she was criticized for
playing Bach in a ``very Romantic fashion.'' But most scholars
would now consider the freedom and boldness of her approach right
in sync with Baroque style. A younger harpsichordist, Skip Sempe,
comes closer to the mark in describing the fearlessness of her
playing as captured on recordings. ``I had only heard this from
Horowitz,'' he says. ``I had only heard it on the piano.''
</P>
<P>
   Landowska is still winning converts like Sempe, which would
probably not surprise her. She comfortably assumed the role of high
priestess of the harpsichord. Yet she could laugh at herself. Once
when she and Ms. Restout gave a costume party, one of Landowska's
male students came dressed as the great woman herself, complete in
a Landowska concert gown with a black bun wig and false nose.
Landowska thought it ``the funniest thing possible,'' Ms. Restout
explains, beaming and a bit teary.

 &HT;    Darker skin now may turn cancerous later
 &HT;    By Staci Sturrock
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ When Jane Katzen was a child, a tan
signified health.
</P>
<P>
   ``My parents would tell me, `You look pale. Go out in the
sun,''' Katzen says.
</P>
<P>
   And so she did. All summer long she frolicked sunscreen-free on
the Jersey shore. In high school, she used a reflector to intensify
the sun's rays. In her 20s, she and her husband sailed from Maine
to South America, and she passed much of those 18 months basting on
deck.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly I was not cognizant of the damage the sun could do
to my skin,'' Katzen says.
</P>
<P>
   By the age of 28, Katzen had her first skin cancer, on her left
forearm. Over the past 22 years, the Lantana registered nurse has
had more than 50 basal and squamous cell cancers removed from her
face, neck, arms, legs and back, leaving behind a landscape of
scars.
</P>
<P>
   She now checks in with her dermatologist every three months and
routinely wears long sleeves and long pants. If she has to spend
extended time in the sun, she'll don Solumbra clothing, which
protects skin from ultraviolet rays.
</P>
<P>
   And she vacations in Seattle, Denmark and Sweden _ ``places
where it's cold and wet,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   But every day, whether cloudy or sun-drenched, she longs for a
tan. ``I was an addict, so I still think that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida: A melanoma capital
</P>
<P>
   Such is the long reach and firm grasp of the sun.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly 1 million Americans are diagnosed with skin cancer each
year, making it the most common type of cancer in the United
States. It's estimated that almost half of Americans who live to
the age of 65 will have skin cancer at least once.
</P>
<P>
   The overwhelming majority of those cancers will be the highly
curable basal cell or squamous cell varieties. Basal cell
carcinoma, a slow-growing cancer, seldom spreads to other parts of
the body. Squamous cell carcinoma also rarely spreads, but it does
so more often than basal.
</P>
<P>
   What worries dermatologists most are melanomas, the most deadly
of skin cancers. Of the estimated 9,200 deaths from skin cancer
this year, 7,300 will be from melanoma.
</P>
<P>
   Cases of melanoma are at an all-time high, and the American
Cancer Society predicts that 44,200 people will be diagnosed with
melanoma this year.
</P>
<P>
   In Florida, an estimated 3,000 new cases of melanoma will be
diagnosed this year, placing the Sunshine State second in the
nation, between first-place California and Texas.
</P>
<P>
   From 1950 to 1990, the national melanoma rate doubled. ``It's a
serious epidemic,'' says Ira Schlesinger, a dermatologist in Delray
Beach. ``With melanoma, all bets are off. It doesn't behave in any
predictable fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   Malignant melanoma can spread to other parts of the body very
quickly, but if detected in its earliest stages and treated
properly, it's also highly cureable.
</P>
<P>
   While it's not clear why the melanoma rate has exploded, factors
include the depletion of the ozone layer _ which in a perfect world
would help protect us from ultraviolet radiation _ and the
time-delayed effects of a nation in love with the sun.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any form of burning or tanning is a sign of sun damage,'' says
Schlesinger, who adds that 90 percent of our sun exposure occurs
before the age of 18, and incidentally.
</P>
<P>
   And the damage is more than epidermis-deep.
</P>
<P>
   When the sun's ultraviolet rays burn the skin, they alter the
DNA in skin cells, prohibiting the DNA from multiplying and
dividing in the proper manner. That opens the door to cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Sun exposure also breaks down the skin's collagen and elastin
(say hello to wrinkles), stimulates pigmentation (greetings,
freckles and moles) and dilates blood vessels (welcome, visible
capillaries).
</P>
<P>
   When tanned meant traveled
</P>
<P>
   To understand the origins of sun worship in this country, you
have to rewind the sundial many moons.
</P>
<P>
   Feeling flush with victory and prosperity, post-World War II
America tilted its collective face heavenward and basked in an
unprecedented age of leisure time, interstate travel and trips to
Florida beaches.
</P>
<P>
   A tan line _ once the mark of farmers, ranchers and others who
toiled outdoors _ became the coveted accessory of the heretofore
pallid middle and upper classes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you had a tan, that showed that you had money to travel,''
Schlesinger says. ``Having a tan was seen as affluent.''
</P>
<P>
   But that affluence came at a price, a bill that did not come due
for decades. Fifty years later, a nation is tanned, rested and
ready ... for skin cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Joan Fread, 69, belonged to that initial generation of sun
worshipers.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the '40s, Fread and her sister would trudge four miles
from their home in Middletown, N.J., catch a bus and then walk
another mile to reach the beach.
</P>
<P>
   There, the teen-agers donned matching swimsuits, slathered
themselves in baby oil and spent up to eight hours a day outdoors.
``We did an awful lot of laying out on the blanket in the sun,''
says Fread, a retired schoolteacher in West Palm Beach. ``We had a
ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Fread's skin would burn just a little, but then everywhere the
sun touched turned to gold. ``I used to have a beautiful tan when I
was young.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Fread avoids the beach but makes regular trips to her
dermatologist's office. She's had a couple dozen pre-cancerous and
cancerous lesions removed from her face, arms and back.
Fortunately, they've all been nonmelanoma.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the high incidence of cancer in her immediate family,
Fread remains ever-vigilant. She visits her dermatologist every few
months for screenings.
</P>
<P>
   Good call, says her dermatologist, Donna Ann Zeide.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the name of the game: To get it nice and early,'' Zeide
says. ``Why should it have to come to half a nose in a gauze pad?''
</P>
<P>
   Who's still going for the burn?
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you're a candidate for this and it's chronic, there's
nothing you can do to stop it,'' says Cathy Kollman.
</P>
<P>
   Kollman speaks from ongoing experience. Within the last month,
she had her latest in a series of surgeries to remove basal and
squamous cell skin cancers.
</P>
<P>
   Kollman, 50, cut high school to go to the beach and previously
vacationed in Puerto Rico and Antigua. ``Every place I went was
always for the sun,'' she says. ``I've been paying for it ever
since.''
</P>
<P>
   After her first cancer was removed from her back in her early
20s, she says her reaction was ```Oh, how am I going to go back in
the sun?'''
</P>
<P>
   It took a few more years and few more cancers for the
seriousness of the disease to sink in. Now, she never goes without
sunscreen and hat when she walks her two golden retrievers on the
beach.
</P>
<P>
   Miami dermatologist Fredric Brandt says the crystal blue
persuasion of Florida's beaches makes reaching his patients with an
anti-tan message that much harder.
</P>
<P>
   ``You go to the beach on any weekend, and you'll see it packed
with people sunbathing,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the bikinied and Speedoed resistance recruits young
adults more than any other group, dermatologists say. (Among 25- to
29-year-olds, melanoma is more common than any non-skin cancer.)
</P>
<P>
   Sun damage is cumulative, and the exposure you get now often
won't show up for decades. ``When we're young, we all think we're
invincible,'' Zeide says. ``It's hard to be good now for five, 10,
20 years from now.''
</P>
<P>
   At noon on a recent Sunday, 22-year-old Ana Maia hit Riviera
Beach armed only with an SPF of 6.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's low, but I know the risks,'' said the West Palm Beach
bank teller. On her twice-monthly trips to the beach, she'll
occasionally leave the sunscreen at home. ``It's dangerous, but
sometimes you have those lazy times where you don't feel like
putting anything on.''
</P>
<P>
   The thought of melanoma scares her, she says, but ``you never
know what life is going to bring and you want to enjoy yourself.''
For Maia, that means sun, surf and a little color on her normally
pale skin. ``You listen to all these doctors, and there's something
wrong with everything,'' says 46-year-old Ed Martin, sunning
SPF-less on Riviera Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Back in Florida after working eight years as a mechanical
engineer in St. Croix, where he shrugged off sunscreen despite the
equatorial rays, Martin grew up on a South Carolina farm. His
parents and grandparents toiled all summer in the fields without
sun protection; SPF factors aren't a part of his heritage.
</P>
<P>
   Wrinkles? Skin cancer? ``When you get to be a certain age,
you're going to get those anyway,'' Martin says.
</P>
<P>
   Clelio Saldana, a 47-year-old heavy equipment operator, also
follows a live-and-let-fry philosophy. ``When God says it's your
turn to go, you go.''
</P>
<P>
   In the middle of a coastal tour from Key West to Charleston,
S.C., Clelio and his wife, Nancy, caught some Riviera Beach rays.
Naturally dark-skinned Clelio wasn't wearing any sunscreen, but the
fair Nancy used Coppertone 30 on her face and shoulders, and
Australia Gold Tanning Accelerator everywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I'm going to burn like a lobster,'' said the nurse's
assistant, 31.
</P>
<P>
   Several blankets away, Randy Eichholz spreads on a tanning oil
with a single-digit SPF.
</P>
<P>
   A 30-year-old social worker from St. Louis, Eichholz is in hot
pursuit of a Florida tan. ``That way I can make all my employees
jealous.''
</P>
<P>
   But the tide may slowly be turning on the ability of tanned skin
to make people green with envy.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood, Madison Avenue and the fashion industry, which
previously set the golden-glow standard with the likes of Raquel
Welch, that memorably bronzed Bain de Soleil model and Christie
Brinkley, are casting the spotlight on whiter shades of pale.
</P>
<P>
   Many modern mannequins, musicians and actresses exemplify the
alabaster look: Nicole Kidman, Madonna, Gwyneth Paltrow, Jewel,
Cate Blanchett and Christina Ricci, to name a fair few.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully that will help all of us,'' says former sun
worshiper Katzen. ``Pale can be absolutely beautiful.''

 &HT;    Risk management for tanning
 &HT;    By Staff reports
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Everybody's free to wear sunscreen, but
for some bodies, it's an absolute must. If you recognize yourself
in the risk factors below, make doubly sure you slop on the
slippery stuff:
</P>
<P>
   _ Light eyes.
</P>
<P>
   _ Fair skin.
</P>
<P>
   _ Light hair.
</P>
<P>
   _ Family history of skin cancer.
</P>
<P>
   _ Chronic sun exposure throughout life.
</P>
<P>
   _ Blistering sunburns as a child or adolescent.
</P>
<P>
   Those at high risk should start getting annual skin-cancer
screenings in their early 20s. From then on, ``check your birthday
suit on your birthday,'' says dermatologist Donna Ann Zeide.
</P>
<P>
   Sizing up skin cancer
</P>
<P>
   Not sure if that mole is something to mull over? Remember the
ABCDE's of melanoma's warning signs:
</P>
<P>
   Asymmetry _ One half of the mole does not match the other.
</P>
<P>
   Border _ The edges are ragged, notched or blurred.
</P>
<P>
   Color _ The pigmentation is not uniform, with variable degrees
of tan, brown or black. Also look out for red, white or blue moles.
</P>
<P>
   Diameter _ Diameter greater than 6 millimeters (or bigger than a
pencil eraser). Any increase in size should be of particular
concern.
</P>
<P>
   Elevation _ The mole isn't flush with the surface of the skin.
</P>
<P>
   ``But none of those things really tell the whole story,'' says
Dr. Ira Schlesinger.
</P>
<P>
   When in doubt, have your dermatologist check it out.
</P>
<P>
   And don't wait for a questionable area to hurt; skin cancers
seldom cause pain.
</P>
<P>
   Here comes the sunscreen
</P>
<P>
   No need to adopt a vampire's aversion to the sun. Solar-smart
folks follow this advice:
</P>
<P>
   Wear sunscreen every day, even if you're only going from house
to car and car to office.
</P>
<P>
   The range of products is wider than ever: spray-on sunscreens;
stick sunscreens; sunscreens for acne sufferers; foundations or
moisturizers blended with sunscreens. Find a product you like and
apply it religiously.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no point in torturing yourself every day,'' says
dermatologist Donna Ann Zeide says. Adds Schlesinger: ``If you're
not going to use it, it's not worth anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Look for broad-spectrum UVA and UVB protection. The key
ingredients? Titanium dioxide, zinc oxide or Parsol 1789. And never
dip below SPF 15.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like using a condom with a hole in it,'' Zeide says.
``There's no point.''
</P>
<P>
   Protect the oft-neglected eyelids, earlobes and lips. Women
develop fewer skin cancers on their lips than men do because they
enjoy the physical protection of lipstick.
</P>
<P>
   Cover up your kids. Children especially need sunblock _
two-thirds of sun damage happens before the age of 15. But don't
put sunscreen on babies under 6 months of age; keep them out of
direct sunlight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parents know it's good to prevent sunburn, but they don't know
it's good to prevent sun,'' Schlesinger says.
</P>
<P>
   Replace your sunscreen annually. Unopened, sunscreen has a shelf
life of up to three years. Once opened, the SPF starts breaking
down. It's a good idea to buy new products at the beginning of each
summer.
</P>
<P>
   Spray on your tan. For those who can't warm to the thought of
alabaster skin, bronzing powders and self-tanning lotions now color
cosmetic counters, and the new formulas forgo the telltale orange
tint of yesteryear.
</P>
<P>
   Complete all outdoor activities before 10 a.m. or start them
after 4 p.m. to avoid the sun at its strongest.
</P>
<P>
   Get to know your skin. Practice self-exams to familiarize
yourself with your own landscape. That way, you can more easily
notice mole changes such as growing, bleeding or crusting.

 `THE HUNLEY:' A DRAMATIC STORYFROM A FOOTNOTE IN THE CIVIL WAR 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review. Time, channel are for
New York area. Check local listings.) 
(DW) 
 By RON WERTHEIMER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   While history may be written by the victors, the losers are
sometimes remembered with respectful affection. So here is ``The
Hunley,'' a television movie that takes its inspiration from a
fascinating footnote to the Civil War, saluting a small band of
Confederate patriots who served with honor.
</P>
<P>
   This drama, unapologetically sympathetic to the Southern cause,
comes from TNT in Atlanta, which is offering the film's premiere
Sunday night. This is no mere exercise in whistling ``Dixie.''
``The Hunley'' is built of solid storytelling and a hard-edged
central performance by Armand Assante.
</P>
<P>
   Assante, a long way from ``The Odyssey,'' plays Lt. George E.
Dixon, an engineer who is given command of the Confederacy's secret
weapon, a submarine. The vessel, called the H.L. Hunley after its
inventor, has already claimed the lives of two crews, including its
namesake. But Gen. Pierre G.T. Beauregard (Donald Sutherland),
himself an engineer, is desperate to break the Union blockade of
Charleston. He decides to give the experimental craft another try
and another commander.
</P>
<P>
   Dixon and Beauregard have suffered grave personal losses. The
grizzled Dixon's limp is a result of an injury he sustained under
Beauregard's command at Shiloh. The bullet Dixon took in the leg
might have killed him had its course not been blocked by the lucky
coin in his pocket, a parting gift from his beloved wife, who later
perished when Union forces sank a boat on which she was traveling.
</P>
<P>
   Beauregard is a widower, too; his wife died in childbirth. His
reputation is in tatters after some blunders as a commander and his
disdainful treatment by Jefferson Davis, for whom he bears a
smoldering hatred. These background details and others upon which
the drama turns are laid out naturally as the story unfolds.
</P>
<P>
   Sutherland brings a tragic weariness to his smaller but pivotal
role. While his Creole accent and reddish hair dye seem to have
been applied too generously, his blue eyes clearly convey soul-deep
pain. Occasionally his words serve the drama, too, as when he tells
Dixon, ``We are both romantics in an age of barbarians.''
</P>
<P>
   But the film belongs to Assante. His character, the nearly
broken officer who must turn a ragtag bunch of misfits into a
unified unit of heroes, could easily have turned into a cliche. But
with the collaboration of the film's writer-director, John Gray,
Assante manages to blend Dixon's strength and anguish into a
believable whole.
</P>
<P>
   The other men of the Hunley never seem less than fully formed,
even though the characters must be rendered in the quick strokes of
movie shorthand. Notable among them are Alex Jennings, Christopher
Bauer and Sebastian Roche, all of whom provide moments of heartfelt
humanity.
</P>
<P>
   The film surrounds its actors with atmospheric context, whether
in the belly of the cramped submarine or on the streets of
Charleston under barrage. The visual effects are nearly always in
harmony with the drama, seldom overwhelming it. Brief scenes that
combine flashbacks with moments of Dixon's fantasy are well
handled, although a garnish of mysticism near the end does mar the
film's conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   History shows that the Hunley was not able to reverse the course
of the war. But its legacy, generations of more successful
submarines, now includes one more element, a memorable film.

<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Twenty-nine Texas inmates claim they were forced to
sit in a prison courtyard in blistering heat for more than six
hours and suffered severe sunburns.
</P>
<P>
   Nineteen of them required medical treatment, according to a
civil rights lawsuit filed in federal court in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, it was reported that they had first- and
second-degree burns,'' said the inmates' attorney, Benton
Musslewhite.
</P>
<P>
   The suit seeks unspecified compensatory and punitive damages
against the Texas Department of Criminal Justice.
</P>
<P>
   All 29 inmates were housed in a dormitory at the Pam Lychner
State Jail Facility in Humble.
</P>
<P>
   Musslewhite said some type of altercation occurred July 7, 1997,
and guards ``ordered the inmates out into the yard into the hot sun
as punishment.''
</P>
<P>
   The suit said they were ordered into the yard at about 11:30
a.m. ``only in their shorts, without shade, food, water or any
other care'' and forced to stay there until about 5:45 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``The temperature that day exceeded 100 degrees and was even
higher pursuant to the heat index,'' the suit said. ``Though all
were badly sunburned, some seriously, they were not given any
medical attention until over three hours later.''
</P>
<P>
   The suit said 19 were taken to a medical facility at about 9:20
p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``The foregoing conduct constituted cruel and unusual
punishment,'' the suit said.

GARDENING: SUNFLOWERS TO DISPLAY, WITHOUT SOILING THE DOILIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release on Sunday, July 11)  
 (bl)  
 By CASS PETERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Like most children, I picked flowers for my mother. Dandelions
from the backyard, tulips from the flower bed, sunflowers and Queen
Anne's lace from the roadside ditch. One was as good as another
when the urge to be generous struck, and they all looked beautiful
to me.
 &HT;    It never occurred to me that Mom might have preferred the tulips
where they were. All my offerings were received graciously and
transferred to suitable vases for display in honored locations.
 &HT;    Except the sunflowers. The sunflowers always ended up on the
kitchen table. I thought it was because she considered them
ordinary. In Kansas, wild sunflowers in high summer were as common
as crab grass. One day, when I moved an especially nice vaseful to
what I considered a more appropriate spot on the dining room
sideboard, I discovered the real reason.
 &HT;    Pollen. By the time my mother spied the sunflowers, which I'd
placed in the middle of a snowy-white starched doily, the doily
looked as if it had been dusted with dry mustard powder. Lots of
dry mustard powder.
 &HT;    Flower pollen leaves a stain that is difficult to remove. Other
flowers, notably lilies, shed pollen, too. But lilies bear their
pollen in fat anthers atop tall stamens, which are easily removed
if the flowers are to be carried, worn or displayed on the family's
heirloom lace tablecloth.
 &HT;    The sunflower's pollen is carried on short stamens, hundreds of
them, covering the central disk. Outdoors, bumblebees and other
pollen collectors gather the golden dust as soon as it develops,
which is why you don't notice shedding pollen in the garden.
Indoors, the flower sheds on everything.
 &HT;    So it is a very good thing for fine table linen _ if not a great
stride forward for bumblebees _ that those who make it their
business to improve upon nature have managed to create pollen-free
sunflowers.
 &HT;    It's like finally housebreaking the dog. Pollen-free varieties
are welcome anywhere in the house, not just in the easily scoured
kitchen. Sunflowers are now seen in the very best places, their
big, brash, cheerful blooms starring in fancy floral arrangements.
The bride can carry sunflowers and still wear white.
 &HT;    The pollen-free varieties, classified as Helianthus hybridus,
are tall and stately, just like standard sunflowers, and they
require as much growing space. The Henry Wilde variety, one of the
tallest of the pollen-free hybrids, will grow to 10 feet if it
likes the place where it's planted. It's worth the expenditure of
real estate: in addition to the flower atop the main stem, Henry
Wilde produces abundant side branches with flowers almost as large
as the top bloom.
 &HT;    Sunrich Lemon and Sunrich Orange will grow to six feet if
planted a foot or more apart, but you can keep them to around three
feet if you seed them six inches apart. These varieties produce a
single flowering stem, without branching, but the dark-centered
flower can be eight inches across.
 &HT;    Sunbeam is bright yellow, similar to Sunrich Lemon except that
its center is lime green. Sunbright is also bright yellow, but with
a dark center. Another interesting pollen-free sunflower is the
Joker, a double-flowered variety with frilly yellow petals and a
dark center.
 &HT;    The seeds are large and germinate easily, and the plants grow
fast, so sunflowers are usually planted directly in the ground
where they are to grow. Even six-foot sunflowers will be ready to
bloom 8 or 10 weeks after sowing, so it's possible to plant them
fairly late in the season. I've planted sunflowers as late as early
August in south-central Pennsylvania and enjoyed plenty of cut
flowers from the crop. If you're planting late, you might crowd the
plants a little _ no more than five or six inches apart _ to
encourage them to bloom early.
 &HT;    Cut them as soon as the petals start to open. They will finish
opening in the vase. Because the flower is dense and heavy,
sunflowers need to take up plenty of water to stay fresh after
being cut. To help with this, I cut several two- to three-inch
lengthwise slits in the bottom of the stem to increase the area
available to absorb water. Be sure to check the water level daily
and change it frequently.
 &HT;    Most sunflower varieties will last a week as cut flowers; the
pollen-free hybrids are usually good for 10 days or more.
 &HT;    So far, no pollen-free hybrids quite match the rich mahogany-red
blossoms of Velvet Queen or Red Sun, or the amazingly frilly
flowers of Giant Sungold, which looks like a massive orange
chrysanthemum on a six-foot stem. Nor do I know of any pollen-free
mixtures that can touch the venerable Autumn Beauty, with its wide
variety of chocolate brown and gold and striped flowers.
 &HT;    These are still garden classics and always will be worth growing
to beautify the garden (as well as to pacify the bumblebees).
 &HT;    I still like growing Mammoth Russian, too, although it is grown
more for its edible seeds than for its bloom. The petals are
dwarfed by the immense center, which quickly becomes so heavy with
seeds that it bends over and faces the ground.
 &HT;    Still, it's a treat to see sunflowers being accorded the
cut-flower status their beauty deserves. I still think they look
best mixed with Queen Anne's lace and wild asters.
 &HT;    That's how Mom arranged them on her last visit. Even though they
were pollen-free, she put them in the kitchen.
 &HT;

 &HT;    THIS WEEK: BEDEVIL THE PESTS THAT BEDEVIL YOU

<TEXT>
<P>
   Keep up with weeding and watering. Use dilute foliar sprays of
liquid seaweed, instead of high-nitrogen fertilizers, which
encourage the excessive growth that aphids love; this will also
boost resistance to fungal diseases. Stop pinching fall bloomers
like chrysanthemum and aster.
</P>
<P>
   Although bronze fennel is grown mostly for its foliage and is a
self-seeding nuisance, let some flower to attract parasitic wasps.
They are welcome predators of pests like tomato hornworms; handpick
these two- to four-inch squishy green caterpillars unless you spot
the white rice-shape cocoons of parasitic wasps on their backs.
Leave those so that the wasps can complete their life cycle.
</P>
<P>
   Handpicking other leaf skeletonizers like Japanese beetles and
two-banded Japanese weevils is the safest control at this stage in
their life cycle. Spray hemlocks again with insecticidal soap or
horticultural oil for woolly adelgid. Continue to spread
diatomaceous earth to control slugs and ants.

RUSSIA CONDUCTED MOCK NUCLEAR STRIKES IN JUNE, DEFENSE MINISTER
SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By MICHAEL R. GORDON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Reflecting its growing dependence on nuclear weapons
for defense, Russia's military carried out mock nuclear strikes in
a major exercise last month, the defense minister said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The exercise was the largest since the collapse of the Soviet
Union. It involved 50,000 troops, bombers, tanks and warships from
the Barents Sea to the Black Sea.
</P>
<P>
   One of the scenarios for the exercise underscored the expanding
role nuclear weapons are playing in the Russian military's strategy
and plans.
</P>
<P>
   According to the script for the military exercise, disclosed
Friday by Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev, Russia came under attack
by an unspecified Western foe, which used non-nuclear forces.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Russia also tried to limit its attacks to conventional
forces. But its cash-strapped non-nuclear forces failed to stop the
enemy onslaught, forcing Russia's leadership to turn to its still
formidable nuclear arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The exercise tested one of the provisions of Russia's military
doctrine concerning a possible use of nuclear weapons when all
other measures are exhausted,'' Sergeyev said Friday. ``We did
pursue such an option. All measures were exhausted. Our defenses
proved to be ineffective. An enemy continued to push into Russia.
And that's when the decision to use nuclear weapons was made.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Russia has long bristled with nuclear weapons. During
Soviet times, Moscow and Washington piled up huge nuclear arsenals
as they sought to best each other in the arms race.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Russia's conventional forces were enormous. In those
years it was NATO, fearing that it was outnumbered, that openly
threatened to initiate the use of nuclear weapons in response to a
non-nuclear attack.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the Soviet Union has collapsed, however, the tables
have turned. The West has become less dependent on nuclear weapons.
As the conflict with Yugoslavia showed, NATO fights its wars with
laser-guided and satellite-guided non-nuclear bombs and missiles.
</P>
<P>
   But with Russia's military spending projected this year at about
$4 billion (compared with about $260 billion for the Pentagon), the
once-mighty conventional forces have deteriorated.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's forces failed to defeat Chechnya's rebels, and Russian
generals are no longer confident that they can prevail over more
serious threats. And with a faltering economy, nuclear forces are
virtually the only way Russia can lay claim to being a world power.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia's military believes that it must rely more than ever on
the first use of nuclear weapons,'' said Bruce Blair, a specialist
on Russian nuclear capabilities at the Brookings Institution. ``It
is part psychological and partly a planning assumption.''
</P>
<P>
   The first sign of Russia's increasing dependence on nuclear
weapons came in 1993 when the Defense Ministry abandoned the
Soviet-era pledge not to be the first to use nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Then, as NATO's bombing attacks against Yugoslavia reinforced
the sense here that the West has a huge lead in conventional
military technology, President Boris Yeltsin called together his
top national security advisers to discuss plans to compensate for
Russia's faltering conventional capabilities by developing
short-range, tactical nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The projects and plans that were approved remain secret. But
Vladim Putin, the secretary of the security council, said Yeltsin
had approved a ``blueprint for the development and use of
nonstrategic nuclear weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   None of this means that NATO and Russia are necessarily on a
collision course. The Yeltsin government has pledged to cooperate
on arms control, including seeking the Russian Parliament's
approval of the START II treaty reducing strategic nuclear arms.
</P>
<P>
   And on Thursday, Yeltsin enjoined a group of Russian generals to
cooperate with NATO in enforcing the peace in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem of our relations with NATO and the U.S.A. is very
subtle, delicate and difficult,'' Yeltsin said. ``Every one of you
must pursue the same line _ the president's line. We shall
certainly not quarrel with NATO outright, but nor do we intend to
flirt with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia's current exercise, however, demonstrated the competitive
nature of the relationship. The weeklong exercise, which was held
in late June, was planned last year but adapted to take account of
the Yugoslav conflict, including NATO's ability to attack at long
range with precision-guided bombs, Sergeyev said.
</P>
<P>
   Much of exercise was intended to test command procedures for
defending western Russia and Belarus from an attack from the West.
</P>
<P>
   ``To verify the authenticity of the decisions and test
procedures for troop control, more than 50 military units
participated in the exercise,'' Sergeyev said. ``There have been
extensive structural changes to the forces in recent years, and we
have to practice their management and regain units' operational
skills.''
</P>
<P>
   During the exercise two old turbo-prop Bear bombers approached
Iceland while a couple of new Blackjack bombers approached Norway.
Russian ships maneuvered under the watchful eyes of Western
reconnaissance ships and aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, the Defense Ministry declined to specify who the
imaginary enemy was. The aim, Sergeyev told the Russian Itar-Tass
news agency, was to rehearse the defeat of the enemy and the
recapture of lost territory.
</P>
<P>
   Some Russian observers were less diplomatic. The Defense
Ministry, the newspaper Nezavisimaya Gazeta noted, refuses to say
who the adversary is.
</P>
<P>
   ``But few doubt that the enemy is NATO's armed forces in
Europe,'' it added.

 &UR; NAMES _  &LR; When Hewlett-Packard Co. decided a few months ago to spin
off its noncomputer business into a separate company, that was the
easy part. Now for the hard part: what do you call the thing? ``We
held a mock contest for the name, but it was never a serious
effort,'' said Michael Fournell, a spokesman for ``NewCo,'' which
is the informal code name given by Hewlett-Packard to the new
enterprise. ``We knew we needed an expert.'' They weren't alone.
According to Enterprise IG, a worldwide brand-consulting firm, a
record 1,456 U.S. companies adopted new names in the first half of
the year, up 52 percent from a year before. Nearly a third of the
changes stemmed from mergers, reorganizations and spin-offs. BY

   VIEQUES, Puerto Rico _ For more than two months, about three
dozen people have occupied the eastern tip of this small island
seven miles off the coast of Puerto Rico trespassing on property
controlled by the U.S. Navy in an act of deliberate defiance. They
have set up tents, built a chapel and walked among craters, target
boards and unexploded bombs at the Navy's live-fire range, vowing
not to leave until the military training exercises are stopped.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're fighting for the future of a new generation,'' said
Carlos Zenon, a 62-year-old fisherman whose group, one of four
occupying the Navy property, planned to move in chickens and goats
in the next few weeks to further populate the range.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy has used Vieques for target practice since 1941, but
that arrangement is under investigation by a special federal panel
and is fueling an unprecedented uproar in Puerto Rico, uniting
political parties and environmental and religious groups, after a
civilian security guard was killed and four other people were
injured in April when an F/A-18 jet dropped two bombs one and a
half miles from its intended target.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since its acquisition by the United States
after the 1898 Spanish-American War, Puerto Rico, a self-governing
commonwealth and a U.S. military outpost in the Caribbean, is
demanding that the Navy end all military activities in Vieques and
return the land it acquired in the 1940s.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a special commission appointed by Gov. Pedro Rossello
concluded that the military training had caused disastrous economic
and environmental damage and that it violated the human and
constitutional rights of the 9,300 residents of Vieques. The panel
recommended that the Navy clean up and leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not an expression of Puerto Ricans' unwillingness to
serve or contribute to the defense of the nation,'' Rossello said
in an interview. ``This is specifically about irreversible and
significant damage to a community of United States citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   The April accident underscored the problems facing Vieques, a
51-square-mile island _ about twice the size of Manhattan _ whose
towns of Isabel Segunda and Esperanza are within a dozen miles of
the live-impact range used by the Navy about 180 days of the year.
No more than 12 percent of the ammunition fired in Vieques involves
live explosives, Navy spokesmen said, but opponents of the training
exercises have for years blamed the explosions not only for
rattling windows and making residents anxious about their safety,
but for stifling Vieques' fledging tourism, hurting the livelihood
of fishermen and leaving the small island behind the rest of Puerto
Rico in income, employment and quality of life.
</P>
<P>
   Last February, Navy pilots at the range accidentally fired 263
shells tipped with depleted uranium _ a dense material used to
penetrate thick armor _ and although Nuclear Regulatory Commission
officials say the radioactivity from the uranium is very low, the
news increased health concerns here among people already reeling
from unexplained high rates of cancer.

<P>
   The security guard killed in the April accident, 35-year-old
David Sanes, was the first civilian casualty since the training
exercises began, but Puerto Rico officials say there have been
close calls over the years. In 1993, the officials say, a plane
dropped five bombs, four of which detonated within Navy property
but about a mile from Isabel Segunda, Vieques' main town. In 1997,
a vehicle was hit by M-16 bullets in the municipal dump.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody would allow this in the United States,'' said Ruben
Reyes, a 34-year-old agronomist who lives here with his wife and
18-month-old son. ``I don't have a problem with the Navy, but it
seems illogical to me that they conduct exercises so close to
citizens. To them, we're cockroaches.''
</P>
<P>
   Navy officials say their practices have been conducted under
strict regulations to insure safety and the preservation of the
environment, and that they consider only one civilian death in
nearly 60 years of military exercises to be a safe record. The Navy
is conducting its own investigation of the April accident and has
suspended maneuvers in Vieques. President Clinton has appointed a
special federal panel to study the Navy's need for operations in
Vieques and possible alternatives. The panel's report is expected
by August.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, exercises continue in the Caribbean, 50 miles away,
where a battle group of 10,000 troops, two submarines, a dozen
destroyers and frigates and more than 20 F/A-18s and other attack
aircraft led by the carrier John F. Kennedy. Last week they
conducted air defense exercises on the high seas, simulating a
conflict in the Persian Gulf, spotting unidentified aircraft and
shooting at imaginary enemies.
</P>
<P>
   But to fully prepare for war, Navy officials on the Kennedy
said, they need Vieques, the only place where they can count on
nearly 200,000 square miles of uncongested air and sea space and
land for target and amphibious assault practice, allowing all
battle components to come together in a realistic scenario.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the only unencumbered place by air and sea next to land
targets,'' said Adm. Carlos Johnson, the battle group commander.
``There really is no other place.''
</P>
<P>
   Vieques also offers a sophisticated infrastructure, the
officials said, including an underwater training range between
Vieques and the U.S. Virgin Islands of St. Croix and St. Thomas for
submarines. The range is worth billions of dollars. A Navy
spokesman said it would be unlikely that kind of money would be
forthcoming to replicate Vieques somewhere else.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Navy lost Vieques, carrier battle groups would deploy
with substandard training,'' said Capt. James Stark, commanding
officer at the Roosevelt Roads Naval Station in Ceiba, Puerto Rico,
to which the Navy range in Vieques belongs.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the Navy's exercises do not question the need for
the training but they argue that Vieques has had enough of it.
</P>
<P>
   In a June 9 letter to Rossello, Clinton stressed that the small
island was ``a vital part of our national defense and regional
security readiness training.'' Vieques is the biggest training
range for the Atlantic Fleet and has provided training for the
United States and its allies since World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Officials say there are a dozen other Navy live-fire ranges _
two in Florida serve the Atlantic fleet, 10 in Nevada, Washington,
Alaska, California, Arizona and Hawaii serve the Pacific fleet _
and that some were as close to population centers as the Vieques
range. But only here does the Navy conduct large-scale exercises
involving all Navy war resources and only here has the Navy's
presence been entangled with the politics of a U.S. territory where
a small segment of its 3.8 million residents want independence and
consider the military a symbol of colonialism.
</P>
<P>
   ``It goes to the heart of the United States control over Puerto
Rico,'' said Ruben Berrios, a senator and president of the Puerto
Rican Independence Party who is among the protesters camped out in
the practice range here. ``We see this as the great opportunity to
correct a historic injustice.''
</P>
<P>
   The Navy acquired lands and began training in Vieques and a
smaller island, Culebra, in the early 1940s, when Puerto Rico's
governors were appointed by Washington, and before the autonomous
commonwealth status was granted by the United States in 1952.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy acquired three-fourths of Vieques, about 26,000 acres,
squeezing its then 10,000 residents between restricted federal
property that includes the 800-acre live-impact area at the eastern
tip of Vieques and an ammunition storage area at the western end.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, the Navy training has ignited protests,
blockades by fishing boats, brawls between off-duty sailors and
local residents, and a federal lawsuit by the governor of Puerto
Rico in 1978 asserting that the shells and bombs were endangering
Vieques' residents and destroying coral reefs, sandbars, wildlife
and other natural resources. (Similar protests had led the Navy to
stop exercises in Culebra in 1975.)
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit led to a memorandum of understanding between the
government of Puerto Rico and the Navy in 1983 that committed the
Navy to promote economic development in Vieques and undertake
conservation measures to protect endangered species like sea
turtles and the brown pelican. But 16 years later, Rossello's
commission found that little of what the memo called for had been
achieved and that the Navy's presence had hampered economic growth.
The commission said that lagoons and forests have disappeared and
mountains and coastline have been disfigured. Commissioners said
there was also evidence that materials like TNT from explosives had
infiltrated potable water reserves.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're suffering a slow death,'' said Manuela Santiago, the
mayor of Vieques and a member of the governor's commission. The
small island lags behind the rest of Puerto Rico, with 73 percent
of its population living in poverty, compared with 58 percent in
the rest of the commonwealth. Vieques residents have no airplane or
ferry service at night, no stoplights, no movie theater and no
hospital, ``not even a Burger King,'' one resident noted.
</P>
<P>
   But Vieques attracts about 4,000 tourists a year, drawn to its
pristine beaches, bioluminescent bays and slow pace. Small cruise
ships stop here and a new 155-room luxury resort is to open in
December, creating 200 jobs. The municipality is also expanding its
airport on land donated by the Navy.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Puerto Rican and white flags for peace flutter from car
antennas all over Vieques. Signs reading ``Navy Out of Vieques''
and ``Civilian sectors off limits for all military personnel and
friends'' have sprung up on streets. Navy officials have restricted
the movement of its uniformed personnel outside their property but
to avoid a confrontation, they said, have not arrested any of the
trespassing protesters. Instead, they have posted a medical team to
stand by in case any of the demonstrators accidentally sets off an
explosion in the range.
</P>
<P>
   Sanes' death led Puerto Rico's three political parties to come
together against the Navy's presence here in a rare display of
unity, joined by religious, environmental and other groups. A
Fourth of July march in front of the Roosevelt Roads Naval Station
in Cieba drew more than 12,000 people according to Navy estimates,
and up to 50,000 according to the Puerto Rican police. The Puerto
Rico Legislature recently allocated $100,000 for an epidemiological
study into Vieques' cancer rate, which is 27 percent higher than in
the rest of Puerto Rico, and the government is preparing for legal
action as a last resort.
</P>
<P>
   In an emotional presentation of the governor's commission report
last week, Secretary of State Norma Burgos choked back tears to
apologize on behalf of the government of Puerto Rico to the
residents of Vieques.
</P>
<P>
   ``In one way or another,'' Ms. Burgos said, ``we've all been
responsible for what's happened.''

FISCAL STRESS MAY FINISH OFF MIR SPACECRAFT EARLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ They tried putting Mir up for sale and offering a $100
million cosmic joy ride to a shadowy British businessman. They
tried asking the Russian public to pitch in to help keep the aging
space station in orbit.
</P>
<P>
   But none of the frantic fund-raising ideas dreamed up by
officials from the Russian space agency could save the country's
beleaguered, beloved orbital craft. This spring, Russia announced
it would leave Mir unmanned beginning in August, and then discard
it early next year.
</P>
<P>
   Now, an untimely spat between Russia and its fellow former
Soviet neighbor Kazakhstan is threatening to finish off Mir sooner,
and more dramatically, than anyone here expected.
</P>
<P>
   Picture an out-of-control, 130-ton fireball careening toward
who-knows-where on Earth. This, Russian space officials say, is a
potential consequence of Kazakhstan's abrupt decision this week to
ban all launches at the Baikonur Cosmodrome, the chief launch site
for Russian space missions.
</P>
<P>
   Kazakhstan, which inherited the Baikonur site when the Soviet
Union collapsed and has leased its services to Russia, announced
the ban after a Proton booster rocket carrying a Russian military
satellite exploded shortly after takeoff Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Kazakhstan officials said the explosion showered a desolate
region of this vast Central Asian land with toxic heptile rocket
fuel. They said the launch site would be closed until a commission
figures out the extent of the damage to the environment and
determines whether other launches will be safe.
</P>
<P>
   Kazakhstan Friday prevented Russia from sending a joint
Russian-Ukrainian weather satellite into orbit. But what really
worries Russian space agency officials is Wednesday's scheduled
launch of an unmanned supply ship carrying food and water for Mir's
crew _ and a new navigation system vital to the plan for a
controlled reentry into Earth's atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Russian officials said the Mir crew _ cosmonauts Viktor
Afanasyev, Sergei Avdeyev, and French astronaut Jean-Pierre
Heignere _ will have to abandon the station next Saturday if they
do not receive fresh supplies of food and equipment. Without the
navigation system to guide it, mission control will be unable to
control Mir's descent toward Earth.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that equipment isn't delivered at a certain time, the crew
obviously won't be able to install it,'' Russian Space Agency
spokesman Sergei Gorbunov said Friday. ``The procedure of lowering
the station's orbit will be ruptured.''
</P>
<P>
   Gromov said Kazakhstan's ban would make it much more difficult
to ensure the safe return that ground control was planning. The
idea was to direct the station _ which will ignite when it reenters
the atmosphere _ over a desolate area of the ocean and let it fall
into the water. Last month, a group of 31 leading space designers
and engineers here issued a statement saying that without guidance
equipment, there was no guarantee where Mir's fiery remains would
come down.
</P>
<P>
   That does not necessarily mean anything terrible will happen.
The US space station Skylab killed a cow in Australia when it fell
to Earth in 1979. And in February, 1991, Russian ground controllers
lost control of the 40-ton Salyut-7 space station, which crashed in
the Andes Mountains but caused no injuries or damage.
</P>
<P>
   Mir, whose planned five-year lifespan was supposed to end in
1991, was supposed to finally come down this summer so that Russia
could focus its energies, and limited funds, on helping the United
States and other countries build the International Space Station.
</P>
<P>
   But Russian officials have recently balked at giving up on Mir,
their unique contribution to space exploration. Western
commentators may dismiss it as a busted-up space jalopy, but for
Russians, especially the engineers who worked on it, Mir is still a
source of national pride. The way they see it, nothing better
epitomizes the Russian talent for resourceful resilience in the
face of hardship than that aging hunk of junk orbiting the earth,
years past its expected lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to find the financing to keep Mir in space, Russian space
officials tried to sell shares in the station to China, but that
deal fell through when Beijing decided to focus on its own space
program. Then they offered to let British entrepreneur Peter
Llewellyn take a ride on Mir for $100 million. Llewellyn, it was
later revealed, had faced swindling charges in the United States,
and he backed out of the deal, too. And an appeal by a veteran
cosmonaut for Russians to invest in their space station brought
little support.
</P>
<P>
   Money seems to be at the root of the dispute with Kazakhstan, as
well. Russian officials have been trying to get Kazakhstan to lift
its ban on rockets, such as the Soyuz that would carry the supply
ship to Mir, that do not use the toxic heptile fuel.
</P>
<P>
   Kazakhstan has so far refused, causing the newspaper Segodnya to
speculate, under a banner headline that read ``Cosmic Blackmail,''
that the Kazakhs were using the ban as an excuse to bring up the
issue of Russia's $300 million in late payments for the use of
Baikonur.
</P>
<P>
   Kazakhstan's Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Pavlov, who is
heading the investigation of this week's crash, seemed to confirm
that theory, criticizing Russia during a news conference Friday for
failing to pay its debts and demanding that Moscow at least pay
damages for the crash.

SWAPPING BUSINESS CONTACTS ON THE WEB  
 LEGAL RESOURCES ON THE WEB

<P>
   The Web has become many things, and one of the things it has
become is a way to share business information quickly and easily.
Well, easier than swapping business cards.
</P>
<P>
   That's somewhat the concept behind ZCentral (www.zcentral.com).
The Web site offers free ``Z numbers'' so users can establish their
names and accounts. Once that's done, individuals can post their
business contact information: name, title, home and office
addresses and telephone numbers, hobbies and other information.
</P>
<P>
   But ZCentral does this just a little differently than other
sites. Users can restrict what information is shown to visitors to
the site. You might reveal only your name, occupation and hometown
in your posting. If a visitor wants to know more, he or she would
send e-mail asking for more information. And then those things
could be revealed on an individual basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``The power behind our site is our patented Zkey,'' said Darren
Jordan, spokesman for Zone Ventures, parent company of ZCentral.
``The Zkey allows members complete control over their profile on a
field-by-field, person-by-person basis.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be a handy place for business colleagues to post their
address books so only other workers would have access to those
address books. But what if you have hundreds of contacts to post?
</P>
<P>
   ``Zcentral will launch Version 3.0 in late August,'' said
Jordan. ``It will incorporate sync software so Zcentral may be used
in conjunction with all hand-held personal information managers,
including the new Palm VII and applications such as Microsoft's
Outlook.''
</P>
<P>
   What if you don't have a computer handy but need to use the
address book?
</P>
<P>
   ``Zcentral will also provide telephonic access to members for
off-Web use,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The site also provides its members with a calendar that can be
set for three different levels of access. There's a box for e-mail,
and conference-room capabilities are provided through AT&AMP;T's
Click2Dial. Users also are given 20 megabytes of storage space for
documents and file sharing.
</P>
<P>
   Sign-up is free. For information: www.zcentral.com.
</P>
<P>
   LEGAL RESOURCE ON THE WEB
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, I wrote about self-help software that can
assist readers who need information about legal issues or may want
to hire an attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Lawoffice.com is a legal portal for businesses, professionals
and consumers. It's run by West Group, a prominent provider of
legal information. Although not a self-help site, it does offer
information about the law and the Web's largest directory of
attorneys, with more than 1 million listed.
</P>
<P>
   ``An extensive database of materials covers more than 400 legal
topics,'' said Molly Ready, spokeswoman for West Group. ``These
subjects include commercial, taxation, bankruptcy, real estate and
intellectual property law, as well as consumer-related issues like
estate planning, health, family and employment law.''
</P>
<P>
   The site also contains tips on which questions to ask before
hiring an attorney to make sure that person is suited for the task.
</P>
<P>
   There also is a dictionary of common legal terms, links to
relevant publications, and Web sites arranged by legal topic and
jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
   The site has been recognized as one of The 50 Most Incredibly
Useful Sites by Yahoo!Internet Life, as well as The Best Place to
Find a Lawyer by PC World magazine. Fortune magazine lists it as
the ``grandpa of legal sites.''

HEARING ON CISNEROS TAPES NEARS END 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GARY MARTIN  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ An acrimonious three-week hearing to determine
whether secretly taped phone conversations can be used in the trial
against former Housing Secretary Henry Cisneros neared an end
Friday when lawyers agreed to wrap up next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can stop the bombing now,'' U.S. District Judge Stanley
Sporkin said.
</P>
<P>
   The judge set Thursday for final testimony and closing arguments
on whether portions of the tapes should be played to jurors who
will hear the government's conspiracy case against Cisneros.
</P>
<P>
   Sporkin has hinted he may allow the tapes into evidence, but he
has voiced concern about the amount of editing on some of them and
privacy issues swirling around the release of those involving third
parties.
</P>
<P>
   The tapes, though, are the heart of Independent Counsel David
Barrett's case against Cisneros, who is accused of concealing from
the FBI $250,000 in payments to a former lover to protect his
nomination to head the Department of Housing and Urban Development.
Barrett's investigation has cost $7 million.
</P>
<P>
   Cisneros and two former HUD aides, John Rosales and Sylvia
Arce-Garcia, have pleaded not guilty to the charges in a 21-count
federal indictment.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Jones of Lubbock, Texas, who carried on an extramarital
affair with Cisneros before he joined the Clinton administration,
is the government's star witness. She told the court she began
taping Cisneros when he was being considered by President Clinton
for the HUD job.
</P>
<P>
   By then, Jones said, Cisneros had begun to reconcile with his
wife. Jones, unemployed and then living in Lubbock, feared public
scrutiny of his HUD nomination would end his pledge to pay her
$4,000 per month.
</P>
<P>
   Jones admitted buying a ``boom box'' and making duplicates of
the tapes, throwing the originals into the trash. She also said she
tampered with about 10 tapes, deleting embarrassing information and
her threats to Cisneros to expose him to the press.
</P>
<P>
   Much of this week's testimony focused on those alterations and
her claims that her two lawyers in Lubbock, Bruce Magness and Floyd
Holder, instructed her to ``scrub'' the tapes.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers have flatly denied her allegations, prompting
Sporkin on Thursday to consider bringing her back to the stand for
a fifth day of testimony, but that now appears unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   Jones sued Cisneros to force him to honor his verbal promise of
financial support. The suit was later settled out of court for
$49,000.
</P>
<P>
   Magness engineered a plan to sell the story of her love affair
with Cisneros to the news media. He said he hoped the media
strategy would pressure Cisneros to settle the lawsuit and would
fuel deals for a movie and a book.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to make money,'' admitted Magness, who eventually
earned less than $10,000 for representing Jones and ended up before
a federal grand jury for 12 days.
</P>
<P>
   Jones pleaded guilty to a 28-count indictment charging her with
money laundering and bank fraud for purchasing a home with
Cisneros' payments that were funneled throug a sister and
brother-in-law. Jones is serving a 3-1/2-year prison sentence at a
medical center in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said she attempted suicide, became addicted to
prescription medicine and suffered from bouts of depression after
her extramarital affair with Cisneros became public in the late
1980s when he was mayor of San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   She has agreed to testify against Cisneros in exchange for a
reduction in her sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Cisneros is the second Clinton Cabinet member to face trial on
charges of unethical behavior. Former Agriculture Secretary Mike
Espy was acquitted in December 1998 on charges of bribery and
accepting illegal gratuities.
</P>
<P>
   Cisneros was housing secretary from 1993 to 1996. He is
currently president of the Los Angeles-based, Spanish-language
network Univision.

<P>
   CETINJE, Yugoslavia _ The government of Montenegro, once careful
not to provoke Big Brother Serbia in Yugoslavia, appears to be
moving swiftly toward independence and seems ready to fight for it
if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   If negotiations with Serbia to get a bigger share of power and
resources fail, this small republic of 600,000 people plans a
referendum in the autumn on independence. Montenegro and Serbia are
the last republics left in the Yugoslav federation, whose Serbian
leaders have been deserted by Slovenia, Croatia, Macedonia and
Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Already Montenegro has developed its own airline and abolished
visa requirements (which are still rigid in Serbia), and is talking
about issuing passports and a new currency tied to the German mark.
</P>
<P>
   More telling yet, the government has promised to arrest all
indicted war criminals who set foot in Montenegro, including
Slobodan Milosevic, the Yugoslav president and thus Montenegro's
head of state.
</P>
<P>
   In many of its moves toward independence, Montenegro is taking a
leaf from Slovenia in the north, which seceded in 1991 after its
demands for more autonomy within Yugoslavia were rejected and its
citizens voted for independence.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia's wars of secession started in Slovenia, which
battled federal soldiers for 10 days before being allowed to leave
the troubled federation.
</P>
<P>
   So Montenegrins, proud people who traditionally bear guns and
boast of never having been completely conquered by the Ottoman
Turks or other occupying powers in the Balkans, are readying for
battle, just in case.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those who yearn to be the core of Montenegro's new army
while away the hours in the Gaeta cafe in this mountain town,
Montenegro's ancient capital, planning resistance as they swill
beer.
</P>
<P>
   Cetinje is the epicenter of Montenegrin nationalism and the
physical embodiment of the new nationalist myth. It was the seat of
the old Montenegrin kingdom, which was dismantled at the end of
World War I when Montenegro became part of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The young men here, known as the Warriors, have crew cuts and
wear gold earrings and black jeans. They say they train in the
hills above the town three days a week, wearing an eclectic
assortment of uniforms and carrying automatic assault rifles that
are said to have been supplied by their government.
</P>
<P>
   The closest they have come to action was last month, when
hundreds of Yugoslav troops loyal to Milosevic surrounded a
training camp on Mount Lovcen, at the edge of Cetinje, and beat and
arrested Bogdan Bozidar, 44, the local militia leader who owns the
Gaeta cafe. Angry villagers, many armed with hunting rifles,
blocked the roads out of the town in a tense standoff with the
soldiers until he was released.
</P>
<P>
   ``The war almost began at that moment,'' said Zoran Gazivoda,
21, one of an estimated 2,000 militiamen, ``but it will not be long
in coming.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Montenegro's president, Milo Djukanovic, broke with
Milosevic, his onetime patron, two years ago, Serbia has waged a
vitriolic campaign against the Montenegrin leader. After the
11-week NATO campaign, which largely spared Montenegro the
bombardment rained on Serbia, the oratory seems to have reached new
depths, with Serbian news media branding Montenegro's leaders
``lackeys of NATO'' and ``traitors.''
</P>
<P>
   Serbia has refused to demobilize several thousand troops in
Montenegro and is forming them into federal police units. Senior
government officials here say this new force will be used to seize
the border crossings into Serbia, which are now controlled by the
Montenegrins.
</P>
<P>
   And that could mean trouble, just as the Slovenes' seizure of
their borders in 1991 started a mini-war.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will arrest the first person who attempts to operate here
in a federal police uniform,'' said Branko Perovic, the republic's
foreign minister. ``We do not recognize federal authority.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing has been the same after the air strikes,'' he said in
an interview in his office in Podgorica, the capital. ``Our policy
was to avoid conflict with the rest of the world, and because of
this Montenegro was largely untouched during the bombing, although
we lost a bridge in the north and about seven civilians were
killed. Serbia, meanwhile, was totally devastated. We are now at
zero and Serbia is at minus-40. Our priorities have become very
different. Things are going now much faster than anyone expected.''

</P>
<P>
   If the federal police do try to take over the border posts, they
could be backed up by 10,000 Yugoslav soldiers still stationed in
Montenegro _ a move that could in turn spark a wider rebellion.
</P>
<P>
   It is not yet clear that it will come to a fight. In Belgrade on
Friday, the official news agency Tanjug announced that
representatives of Milosevic's Socialist party and Djukanovic's
party would meet next week to discuss Montenegro's demands.
Milosevic's party has refused all contact on that score in the 13
months since Djukanovic's supporters triumphed in parliamentary
elections in Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   In a May 26 ultimatum to Belgrade on independence, Montenegro
called for the withdrawal of Yugoslav army troops, control over its
own economy and the right to conduct its own foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   But the Yugoslav army is flexing its muscles, setting up
periodic roadblocks in an attempt to block shipments of goods into
Montenegro because the republic's government _ again following the
Slovene pattern _ is refusing to pay federal customs duties or
taxes to Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   In a gesture indicative of Montenegro's mood, the minister of
tourism, Vladimir Mitrovic, says he has spoken to NATO officials
about sending off-duty soldiers in neighboring Kosovo for holidays
on the Montenegrin coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``These soldiers are more than welcome as tourists,'' said Zarko
Rakcevic, the president of the Social Democratic Party of
Montenegro, one of three coalition partners in the government.
``But they shouldn't leave their weapons behind.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   It seems to have been forgotten that at the start of the wars in
the former Yugoslavia, many Montenegrins enthusiastically embraced
Milosevic's calls for a Greater Serbia. In 1991, Serbian and
Montenegrin soldiers shelled Dubrovnik, on the Croatian coast, and
took part in the frenzy of looting and murder in the war against
Croatia. Thousands of Montenegrin soldiers fought in Bosnia, whose
Serbs were led in war by a native of Montenegro, Radovan Karadzic.
</P>
<P>
   But the Montenegrins, with the ashes of defeat in their mouths,
dismiss their complicity in the destruction of Yugoslavia,
portraying themselves as victims of Serb aggression.
</P>
<P>
   ``We live under Serb occupation,'' said Bozidar, a former
professional handball player wearing a pair of Ray Ban sunglasses,
a blue polo shirt and white shorts. ``Every evil in the Balkans has
come from the Serbs, and we want no part of them. They are
genocidal cowards who have created a society devoid of all morality
and decency.''
</P>
<P>
   In Cetinje, cavernous old foreign embassies, including those
that once belonged to the British, Russian, German, Italian and
French, lie in decay in the city center around overgrown parks and
huge, leafy plane trees. The imposing 15th-century Serbian Orthodox
Church, with its gray stone walls and gold-leaf icons, is filled
with the tombs of the old Montenegrin royalty.
</P>
<P>
   The gloomy royal palace, now a museum, is adorned with oil
portraits of kings and queens who ruled Europe at the beginning of
the century, and with heroic paintings of Montenegrin kings and
princes. Its walls are decorated with ivory handled pistols, inlaid
rifles, swords and ornate gold brocade uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   Tino Vujovic, a painter, climbed the stairs to his loft in the
heart of the town and spoke excitedly about what he sees as coming
independence.
</P>
<P>
   He accused the Serbs of ``stealing the language of the
Montenegrins'' to create Serbian, of being of Turkish descent, even
of lacking a civilization. ``Our language has four more letters
than Serbian,'' he said. ``It is not the same. Everything about us
is different. Serbs are scum.''
</P>
<P>
   The split has sundered the Serbian Orthodox Church. The monks
and priests from Serbia live in the walled monastery on one side of
Cetinje. The priests of Montenegrin descent are encamped in a rival
church across town. The two factions heap abuse on their rivals and
call for the liberation of their rival holy sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hatred between the Serbs and Montenegrins is nothing
compared to the hatred between the two religious orders,'' Bozidar
said. ``Those priests don't even talk to each other anymore. They
are really blood enemies.''

   FRANKFURT, Germany _ It was supposed to be a symbol of new
strength and unity, a sign that Europe had achieved economic parity
with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But today, little more than six months after 11 European nations
adopted the euro as a new single currency, it has become a source
of embarrassment and anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   In a slide that has alarmed many government officials and
surprised most economists, the euro has steadily declined against
the dollar from nearly $1.18 at its introduction on Jan. 4 to just
below $1.02 by the end of Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Despite continuous exhortations by European central bankers
about the euro's fundamental value, it now has a good chance of
dropping below the value of a dollar.
</P>
<P>
   The relentless decline has become a mirror of Europe's economic
weakness and political disunity. It also is a daily reminder of the
contrasting economic boom still under way in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   For Americans, the euro's decline is good news. Europe has
become a far more affordable place to visit _ prices in dollars
have fallen nearly 15 percent since January because of exchange
rates alone. European imports are a bit cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   But for Europeans, the euro's weakness is beginning to pinch
financially. Worried that the euro could fall even more, global
investors have in recent days begun demanding a risk premium _
slightly higher interest rates _ when buying euro-denominated
bonds.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, that means the cost of borrowing for corporations as
well as for people buying homes and cars is edging upward.
</P>
<P>
   Doubts about the euro have intensified before it has even become
a full-fledged currency. It is still used only in corporate and
government financial transactions _ euro notes and coins will not
enter circulation until 2002. But the national currencies of the 11
euro countries are locked into the value of the euro, rising and
falling with it.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing magical or even good about a particular
exchange rate. The dollar has itself fluctuated widely over the
years in relation to other currencies.
</P>
<P>
   A weak euro also has practical advantages for Europeans. It
promotes European exports by making them cheaper in dollar terms.
It creates opportunities for foreign investors looking at European
properties.
</P>
<P>
   Many experts believe that the euro will climb again in the
months ahead. Economic growth is picking up again and inflation is
still negligible, trends that should tend to strengthen the euro.
The currency also should gain from Europe's big trade surplus,
which increases demand for euros and raises their value as European
exporters repatriate profits from healthy sales overseas.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, the biggest cause of the euro's decline has
been Europe's persistently slower growth, running at a rate of
about 2 percent so far in 1999 compared with more than 3 percent in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Germany, which accounts for a third of the economic output of
the 11-nation euro zone, slumped badly after the Russian financial
collapse last summer and is only beginning to bounce back. Italy,
the euro zone's third-largest economy after Germany and France,
stalled as well.
</P>
<P>
   But the euro has been wounded by political uncertainties, too.
Even as European leaders toasted its introduction on New Year's
Eve, left-of-center leaders in countries like France and Germany
were balking at the inflation-fighting priorities of the new
European Central Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Germany's new Social Democratic government under Chancellor
Gerhard Schroeder added to the problems. Schroeder's first finance
minister, Oskar Lafontaine, unnerved investors by loudly badgering
the European Central Bank to lower interest rates, which would
promote more economic growth but make the euro worth less. He also
infuriated industry leaders with plans that would have raised taxes
for many companies and added to regulation.
</P>
<P>
   Lafontaine abruptly resigned in March and Schroeder has now
veered back toward the political center. But Schroeder's shaky
stewardship rattled business confidence, which is only now
beginning to recover.
</P>
<P>
   Political miscues elsewhere in Europe have hurt the euro as
well. Last month the currency tumbled on a suggestion by Romano
Prodi, the former prime minister of Italy who has since become the
European Commission president, that Italy eventually might have to
quit Europe's single currency. Although Prodi said his remarks were
taken out of context, it was the first time a senior official had
even hinted at the possibility of a breakup.
</P>
<P>
   Prodi contributed to the euro's weakness on Thursday, saying he
was not worried about its decline. Germany's new finance minister,
Hans Eichel, went even further. He said on the same day that the
weak euro was ``good for exports'' and ``no problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, the euro's newest low point comes as signs of economic
strength are becoming more numerous. Industrial orders are up in
Germany. Business confidence has climbed significantly in France.
Italy, which retreated from its earlier deficit-reduction goals
last month, is tightening up again.
</P>
<P>
   But confidence in the euro has not recovered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Credibility is very easy to lose and very hard to regain,''
said Thomas Mayer, a senior economist at Goldman, Sachs in
Frankfurt. ``Right now, there seems to be a very negative feeling
in the market that is very hard to counter. What we really need is
a significant change in perception, and it is not clear at this
stage what would bring this about.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost daily the last several months, European central bankers
have earnestly tried to talk up the euro as if they were members of
a booster club.
</P>
<P>
   But the bankers have often seemed torn between their
laissez-faire principles and their discomfort at the euro's
decline.
</P>
<P>
   Wim Duisenberg, the Dutch president of the European Central
Bank, caused a fury among many of his colleagues in April when he
described the bank's approach to exchange rates as one of ``benign
neglect.''
</P>
<P>
   The comment prompted Hans Tietmeyer, president of Germany's
central bank, to publicly dispute the idea of neglect and to
complain that ``a significant further change of the euro's level
would not be appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   But the central bankers also appear convinced that if they
intervened in the foreign exchange market, buying euros and selling
dollars to strengthen the euro's value, they would simply undermine
the euro's credibility as a currency that can stand on its own.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they have offered new pep talks every time the euro
slips a bit more.
</P>
<P>
   ``The euro is a currency firmly based on internal price
stability and therefore has a clear potential for a stronger
external value,'' said Jean-Claude Trichet, president of the
National Bank of France, at a conference on Wednesday in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Some experts agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``One should not over play the current fears,'' said Daniel
Gros, deputy director of the Center for European Policy Studies, a
research center in Brussels. ``The economic outlook for Europe in
the medium term has improved considerably. The business cycle
looking forward does not support a euro at this level.''
</P>
<P>
   But even Gros acknowledged that he was surprised by the euro's
decline. Investors behaved much differently toward the euro than he
and many other experts had expected.
</P>
<P>
   Six months ago, many economists and investment analysts
predicted that foreign financial institutions, including central
banks, would start selling dollars and buying euros.
</P>
<P>
   But that did not happen. Rattled by problems ranging from
Russia's collapse to the looming war in Yugoslavia, investors
treated the dollar even more as of a haven than they had before.
</P>
<P>
   Something else happened as well. Because European interest rates
are lower than those in the United States, corporations and
governments sold billions of dollars in new euro-denominated bonds
to take advantage of the lower financing costs. The pace of new
euro-bond offerings actually exceeded that of dollar-bond offerings
in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent pressure on the euro has come from diverging
interest rates between Europe and the United States. In a
significant move to stimulate growth, the European Central Bank
reduced its core interest rate from 3 percent, to 2.5 percent, in
April. By essentially pumping more euros into the economy, the move
put downward pressure on the value of the euro itself.
</P>
<P>
   Then on June 30, the Federal Reserve moved in the opposite
direction. Worried that the American economy could overheat, it
increased its central short-term interest rate from 4.75 percent,
to 5 percent. That pushed up the dollar at a time when the euro was
already weakening.
</P>
<P>
   In a survey of European economists, Reuters reported on Thursday
that 66 percent now expect the euro to reach parity with the dollar
and some believe it will drop even lower.
</P>
<P>
   Many European experts are convinced that government leaders
quietly support the idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fall of the euro in the last six months does not mean that
the euro lacks credibility,'' said Dominique Moisi, deputy director
of the French Institute for International Relations in Paris. ``It
simply means that various European governments have found it very
comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   Recent statistics suggest that the weakened euro has begun to
stimulate new exports and growth in Germany, where growth stagnated
the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
   But the weak euro now seems to be pushing up bond rates, which
means that borrowing money is becoming costlier. Mayer of Goldman,
Sachs noted that the difference between yields on 10-year bonds in
Europe, which had carried yields about 1.6 percentage points lower
than comparable Treasury bills, narrowed significantly the last
week or so.
</P>
<P>
   The shift reflects a new risk premium that investors in
euro-denominated bonds are demanding as protection against further
declines in the euro's value.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until now, people could say that the decline of the euro
didn't cause any real problems,'' Mayer said. ``This is a clear
warning sign that something unpleasant is taking place.'' &QL;

EUROPEAN UNION'S PRESIDENT APPOINTS 19 NEW COMMISSIONERS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Spain, Germany, China, Italy, Britain)   By CRAIG R. WHITNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ The new president of the European Union's Executive
Commission announced the appointment of 19 commissioners Friday,
promising ``a new era of change'' after the forced resignation of
the entire previous commission last spring after accusations of
corruption. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Only four members are holdovers from that commission, which was
accused of cronyism and mismanagement by a panel appointed by the
elected European Parliament. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One of the outgoing commissioners, Martin Bangemann of Germany,
who was in charge of telecommunications, took a job last week with
Telefonica SA, a Spanish company he had been regulating. The 15
European Union ambassadors in Brussels recommended a court
challenge to his right to a $90,000 European pension. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Among the new commissioners is Chris Patten, a British
Conservative who supervised Britain's handover of Hong Kong to
China in 1997 with such a vigorous defense of autonomy for the
former colony that China let it be known that it would not be happy
if he were put in charge of European Union trade relations. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he got the job of managing the European Union's
relations with foreign countries, including China. But Patten will
not speak for the European Union on defense and security issues.
Coordinating those will be Javier Solana of Spain, now secretary
general of NATO, who will report directly to the 15 European Union
heads of state and is not a member of the commission. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The commission's new president, Romano Prodi of Italy, gave the
trade post to Pascal Lamy, a French Socialist and a career
technocrat who was chief of staff to one of the best known
commission presidents, Jacques Delors, from 1985 to 1994. Lamy
replaces Sir Leon Brittan, a British Conservative whom the French
often accused of being too close to American trade views, though
that was hardly the view in Washington. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Guenter Verheugen, a German Social Democrat who has been his
country's deputy foreign minister for the last nine months, will
manage the key issue of expansion. Five formerly Communist
countries and Cyprus are on the short list to join the European
Union, and talks with five other European states are also under
way. But the earliest any of them are likely to get in is several
years from now, officials say. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Prodi gave the job of monetary affairs, including the European
Union's new common currency, the euro, to a former finance minister
of Spain, Pedro Solbes. France did not renominate Yves-Thibault de
Silguy, the centrist Conservative who managed the introduction of
the euro at the beginning of this year. It was worth $1.17 then and
is worth about $1.02 now, though no one has accused him of being
responsible for the decline. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He had to go because France gets only two commission seats and
France's Socialist government wanted to name a Socialist, Lamy, to
an important job in Brussels after former Prime Minister Edith
Cresson, a Socialist, was disgraced last March when she resigned
with the other commissioners. President Jacques Chirac, who is
conservative, decided to sacrifice de Silguy and instead nominate
Michel Barnier, a Gaullist who was France's european affairs
minister from 1995 to 1997. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Prodi put Barnier in charge of regional affairs, distributing
some of the $100 billion European Union budget to the relatively
disadvantaged corners of Europe. Half of the budget goes to farm
support, and Prodi renamed Franz Fischler, an Austrian, as
commissioner for agriculture. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Prodi, an economics professor who has also been prime minister
of Italy, was chosen by leaders of the 15 European Union countries
to replace Jacques Santer of Luxembourg as president of the
commission, which has a five-year term and has the job of managing
the policies the leaders decide on in their innumerable and
sometimes interminable meetings in the European capitals. The
commissioners, who work in Brussels, issue bureaucratic directives
that member countries often turn around and denounce as meddling.
The European Parliament, which indirectly forced the resignation of
Santer's commission, has insisted on the right to confirm Prodi's
new one. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A new Parliament was elected June 13, with around 50 percent of
the voters in France and almost 75 percent of voters in England not
interested enough to cast ballots, and it will hold hearings in
early September. Loyola de Palacio, a former Agriculture minister
of Spain and one of the four women on the commission, will handle
its relations with the Parliament, as well as transport and energy,
as a vice president. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Most real power remains in the hands of the 15 member countries,
which after the usual backroom deals in each capital gave Prodi
nominees to choose from. Britain, Germany, Italy and Spain, in
addition to France, have the right to two commission posts apiece.
The 10 other countries get one each. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Neil Kinnock, a Labor Party leader who left domestic politics
after losing the British election in 1992 and held the transport
portfolio on the commission from 1995 until this year, is a vice
president of the commission in charge of further administrative
reforms. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was appointed, I promised I would start a new era of
change,'' Prodi said. ``It's what the commission needs. It's what
the European public has asked for. This is what I intend to
deliver, starting today.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Forbes introduces Georgia presidential campaign team
 &HT;    By Richard Whitt
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In front of a small group of supporters in the state
Capitol, Republican presidential candidate Steve Forbes announced
his Georgia political team Friday.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Bob Barr (R-Marietta) will be honorary chairman of his
Georgia campaign. Barr also will co-chair the Forbes 2000 national
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Jokingly calling himself the only Republican candidate who can
match Vice President Al Gore in charisma, the staid editor-in-chief
of Forbes magazine promised a return to conservative government if
elected.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to have in America a victory that matters,'' Forbes
said, calling for reforms in education, Social Security retirement
and federal tax laws.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps best known for his flat tax proposals, Forbes favors
abolishing the Internal Revenue Service.
</P>
<P>
   He urged supporters to visit his Web site, www.forbes2000.com,
``to see all that we're proposing.'' Forbes said he will work
aggressively in Georgia and across the country to deliver his
conservative message.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to end the disconnect between Washington and the
American people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Gov. George W. Bush of Texas has sewn up support of
many heavy hitters in the Georgia GOP, Forbes praised his team.
</P>
<P>
   ``This leadership team shows the depth of support enjoyed by my
candidacy in Georgia and the rest of the South. Anyone who thinks
that Republicans coronate their nominees has never encountered the
election-hardened men and women who stand on these stairs today,''
Forbes said.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia co-chairs are: Thomas J. ``Jack'' Barnette, CEO of The
American State College; businessman William B. ``Bill'' Espy; Jerry
Keen, former chairman of the Christian Coalition in Georgia; civil
rights activist Alveda Celeste King; and Carolyn Meadows, RNC
National Committee Woman from Georgia. Russell K. ``Rusty'' Paul,
former two-term chairman of the Georgia GOP, will serve as
Southeastern political director for the national campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have assembled a distinguished committee of solid and
dedicated conservative Republicans to lead an aggressive
grass-roots campaign for Steve Forbes in Georgia. This team is
second to none in experience and capability,'' Barr said.
</P>
<P>
   Barr introduced Forbes, praising him for his boldness and
willingness to take sometimes unpopular positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``He will lead a new generation of conservatives,'' Barr said.

CHRYSLER MINI VAN LOADED WITH EXTRAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB GOLFEN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Chrysler's still on top of the minivan game, the
company that invented these front-wheel-drive people movers in 1984
still out in front of the pack.
</P>
<P>
   There are a number of good minivans on the market today, getting
there mainly by copying the front-drive formula that Chrysler
pioneered. But the DaimlerChrysler versions have managed to remain
ahead in style, performance and comfort.
</P>
<P>
   The Chrysler Town and Country Limited is a unique entity, a
full-boat luxury minivan that would rival any top luxury car or
sport-utility vehicle. There's nothing else like the Town and
Country, which is aimed at an upscale niche in the minivan market
that has all to itself.
</P>
<P>
   The Limited is certainly not just for schlepping the kids off to
soccer practice or trundling the sheepdog down to the park. Now,
there are people who sneer at the very notion of a minivan,
considering their image as too domesticated and boring. But I think
even these prejudiced souls might appreciate the Town and Country's
cushy panache and superior road manners.
</P>
<P>
   The Limited is a long-wheelbase version of the ubiquitous family
of Chrysler/Dodge/Plymouth minivans, and it's loaded with comfort
features, convenience extras and stereo equipment. There is leather
seating for seven in the nicely appointed interior, dual climate
control up front, dual air-conditioning front and rear, and an
overhead console with trip computer and compass.
</P>
<P>
   Like all Chrysler minivans, there are plenty of cubbies and bins
for stowage. And, of course, a plethora of cupholders. Here's a
nice touch: hooks on the back of the rear seat designed to hang
plastic grocery bags.
</P>
<P>
   If usable space is the name of the game, then the Town and
Country has it licked. All six passengers will find more than
adequate leg, head and elbow room, even in the third seat. Much
appreciated by this tall driver was the leg, head and shoulder room
behind the wheel. For cargo, the long-wheelbase model has decent
space behind the third seat, often a failing in minivans.
</P>
<P>
   The middle bucket seats and rear seat are easy to remove but
heavy to carry. If you plan on taking one out, have someone to help
tote it into the garage. Honda's new Odyssey sets the tone for
convenience with its folding rear seat that drops down to form a
flat cargo floor.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the luxury sport utility vehicles that are clogging the
landscape, the Town and Country is stable on back roads and corners
as well as most sedans. The optional 3.8-liter V-6 is strong,
although the minivan's heft takes its toll on acceleration. Freeway
cruising and hill climbing are fairly effortless, but gas mileage
is not great.
</P>
<P>
   The Town and Country is front-wheel-drive, naturally, with
full-time all-wheel drive available as an option. Standard
equipment on the Limited include traction control, load leveling
and height control, and anti-lock brakes.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, the big minivan (an oxymoron?) is attractively shaped
and smoothly aerodynamic, set off with a wide grille decorated with
Chrysler's winged emblem. The test van was sharp in anthracite gray
set off with gorgeous chrome-spoked 16-inch wheels and chrome door
handles. If ever there was a way to make a bulbous baby whale look
attractive, this is probably it.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, the Town and Country has sliding passenger doors on
both sides. Here Chrysler slips behind by not offering powered
sliding doors, like some competitors. Kids struggle with these
doors, otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   The dashboard is very attractive and well-finished, but it did
have one unusual feature that didn't work so well. Above the main
gauge area with the speedometer, gas gauge and other major bits,
there's a separate sliver of gauge space where all the warning
lights and turn-signal indicators are located. Problem is, the
steering wheel inevitably hid some of these important items.
</P>
<P>
   Our test minivan was equipped with white-faced gauges, an odd
touch considering they are usually associated with sports cars.
</P>
<P>
   Lest there be any doubt as to the reigning minivan king, the
latest generation of Chrysler vans are masterpieces of packaging,
well-planned out to be as practical and commodious as possible,
while holding the rising competition at bay. The Town and Country
Limited puts the gild on the lily. &QL;

BAY STATE GOVERNOR WELL GUARDED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TINA CASSIDY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Looking more like Robert De Niro arriving at a
premiere than the governor of Massachusetts attending to state
business, Paul Cellucci squeezed through a security checkpoint at
the Paramount movie compound with three bodyguards in tow.
</P>
<P>
   When the studio executives saw the size of Cellucci's entourage
on his spring trip _ the three bodyguards and nine others _ they
rushed to find a bigger meeting room.
</P>
<P>
   There, the three guards moved to secure the premises, like
Secret Service agents combing a foreign embassy. Luckily, the room
had only two doors and there were three of them, a pair of
Massachusetts state troopers and one California Highway Patrol
officer, all packing guns under their plainclothes jackets.
</P>
<P>
   Mission: successful. Cellucci came home unharmed from his April
journey to Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Two more trade missions overseas have confirmed Cellucci as one
of the most peripatetic governors in recent history. And now some
in the halls of government are wondering if the drum-tight security
is really necessary or just a way of repaying the loyal troopers,
who often sit in an unmarked car for hours while the governor dines
in a North End restaurant, who pick him up at 7 a.m. and drive him
home 14 hours later, and who hold the elevator for him outside his
office.
</P>
<P>
   Others insist that the security detail is just one of the
trappings of office that Cellucci seems to enjoy, unlike some of
his colleagues and predecessors. The five-day Hollywood trip _
complete with Cellucci's suite at the Beverly Hills Four Seasons _
cost taxpayers more than $30,000.
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, the size of Cellucci's security detail and
his willingness to bring it along on faraway missions has created a
potential image problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to me he's more interested in being governor than
doing the work of the governor,'' said Jim St. George, executive
director of the Tax Equity Alliance for Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   In this respect, some Cellucci critics say, the governor is the
opposite of Michael S. Dukakis, who was uncomfortable with the
trappings of office. When Dukakis was governor, he had only the
thinnest of security before running for president and regularly
used public transportation, rather than a State Police driver.
</P>
<P>
   ``He enjoyed the trappings less than any governor in history,''
Republican media consultant Ray Howell said of Dukakis.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci is more of a retail politician who lives for
interaction with the public, Howell said. ``(William F.) Weld lived
for the chess game part of the business. And Paul loves when the
Girl Scouts come in.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of his defenders say Cellucci's desire to go among the
people necessitates greater security. Besides, they say, the real
beefing up of bodyguards began under Weld. And Cellucci, endorsed
by the State Police in the last election, has kept up the numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, other governors make do with less. Governor Lincoln
Almond of Rhode Island has just one State Police driver, who also
serves as his bodyguard. The same goes for Governor Jeanne Shaheen
of New Hampshire and Governor Angus King of Maine.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd shake them if he could. He hates entourages,'' said
King's spokesman, Dennis Bailey.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Cellucci press aide Jason Kauppi insists that the
governor's security detail is necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always the potential for a threat against him,''
Kauppi said. ``It's standard for governors across the country to
have security details, whether they are at home or traveling. Even
just a regular day here, every place the troopers take the
governor, it's their second time going there. They scout the
entrances, check with local police about the potential for protests
or threats.''
</P>
<P>
   One night, Kauppi recalled, Cellucci was leaving a campaign stop
at J. J. Foley's Cafe, a South End bar, when his car was attacked
by union picketers who supported Scott Harshbarger in the
governor's race.
</P>
<P>
   Then, there was an incident Nov. 4 during Cellucci's victory
speech, when three death penalty opponents stormed the stage at the
Park Plaza. They were stopped before they reached the stage.
</P>
<P>
   But the job may not be tedious for the troopers staking out
hallways. In Hollywood, the hotel (Four Seasons, Beverly Hills) and
the stargazing (Leonardo DiCaprio et al) were top notch.
</P>
<P>
   And last week, State Police Sergeant James Hanafin _ who was one
of the Hollywood hall monitors, along with Trooper John Cahill _
found himself at the Paris Air Show, protecting Cellucci on yet
another trade mission.
</P>
<P>
   Hanafin supervises the Executive Protection Unit, which has one
female and six male troopers specially trained by the Secret
Service to guard Cellucci and Lieutenant Governor Jane Swift at
every official event and drive them to and from the State House.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Dichio _ known affectionately as Deech within the
governor's circle _ accompanied Cellucci for the entire eight-day
trade mission to Paris and Ireland, which ended last weekend.
Although no one in the governor's office wants to say that Deech is
Cellucci's favorite, he has been around the longest.
</P>
<P>
   Hanafin and Dichio did the French leg, while Dichio met up with
Trooper Stephen Howard for the Irish stretch, with backup from
police in Belfast and assistance from the US embassy in France.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in the governor's press office bristle at the
suggestion that these trips are junkets for the troopers, whose
expenses are paid by the State Police. In six months, taxpayers
have already spent more than $10,000 sending Cellucci's troopers on
out-of-state and foreign trips with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The State Police makes the determinations as to who and what's
needed in terms of security,'' said Cellucci spokeswoman Ilene
Hoffer. ``I shouldn't say the governor doesn't have a say. If there
were particular concerns, those would be expressed. But the final
decision-making is with the State Police, obviously in coordination
with the governor himself and sometimes with the chief of staff.''
</P>
<P>
   The troopers do not get overtime while traveling.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's staff says the travel assignements are based not
on loyalty or hard work, but on a rotation, one for domestic trips
and one for international trips, which Hanafin oversees.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's whoever it falls to,'' said Kauppi. ``All the trips are
work.''

 &HT;    Spam for all: `Monty' celebrating 30 years
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   And now for something completely familiar. Reruns.
</P>
<P>
   You say you'd rather eat a pound of Spam than watch more reruns
this summer? Ah, but these are the original episodes of ``Monty
Python's Flying Circus,'' possibly the most inventive series in the
history of TV.
</P>
<P>
   Coming up to 30 years ago _ Oct. 5, 1969 _ five very silly
Englishmen and one Yank debuted on Auntie Beeb, as the Brits called
their once-staid BBC. Over four seasons, they produced 45 half-hour
shows filled with cheese shops that didn't sell cheese,
cross-dressing lumberjacks, silly walks, dead parrots, twisted
animation segues, drunken philosophers, naughty bits, exploding
candy and tattooed bishops. They were surreal, they were rude, they
were sometimes so far out they just sailed right off the edge of
the comedy map.
</P>
<P>
   To celebrate the 30th anniversary of ``Python,'' A&AMP;E is airing
the shows, in order, two to an hour. It's the first time in years
they've been shown nationally, although they've popped up from time
to time on local PBS stations, including Georgia Public Television.
</P>
<P>
   And for those who just want to wallow in way too much of a good
thing, there are two new books: the oral history ``Monty Python
Speaks!'' (Spike Books, $13.50) and Robert Ross' ``The Monty Python
Encyclopedia'' (TV Books, $22).
</P>
<P>
   First, let's settle all the nonsense about the name, which is
just that _ nonsense. There is no one named Monty Python; at an
early stage, it was almost ``Gwen Dibley's Flying Circus, or ``The
Toad Elevating Moment.'' The boys _ and they were little more than
that, fresh out of college and frustrating comedy writing jobs,
just wanted something completely different.
</P>
<P>
   Writing and performing the skits were John Cleese, Eric Idle,
Michael Palin, Terry Jones and Graham Chapman. Even then, Cleese
was first among equals, and he and Chapman (a troubled alcoholic
who died in 1989) wrote many of the classic bits, usually about
some poor beleaguered guy who goes into an office expecting one
thing and getting something else entirely. Palin and Jones' skits
usually were set in Iceland and involved Vikings or such, and Idle,
who wrote by himself, was known for his character who just rattled
on and on. The sixth Python was Terry Gilliam, an American who did
the animated bits, and went on to a mixed but interesting career as
a movie director (``The Fisher King'').
</P>
<P>
   In its own way, ``Python'' was as revolutionary as ``The
Prisoner,'' Patrick McGoohan's Kafka-esque secret-agent show that
had debuted the year before. It was huge among young people in
Great Britain, and when it finally crossed over to the United
States in 1974, about the time it was ending in England, it was
just as huge over here, at least among young people who bought into
the surreal anarchy.
</P>
<P>
   And young people keep on getting it. Somewhere, there's always
someone _ frequently, but not always, a high-school boy _
discovering ``Python'' and spreading it to his friends, and another
cafeteria lunch table rings with memorized bits: ``I wish to return
this parrot.''
</P>
<P>
   What's surprising about ``Python'' is how little influence it
had. It greatly influenced the first season of ``Saturday Night
Live,'' but then the American show mutated as it became popular and
settled into a more predictable presentation.
</P>
<P>
   But there is one ``Python''' legacy. The Pythons once did a skit
about a husband and wife ordering food in a diner, and all the
waitress has on the menu is ``Spam, Spam, Spam, Spam and Spam.''
Years later, pioneers of the Internet noticed the rise of junk
e-mail and in one of those leaps of perfect illogic, the Pythons'
old TV skit became permanently attached to the new technology of
junk e-mail. How absurd. How random. How ``Python.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Monty Python's Flying Circus''
</P>
<P>
   11 p.m. Saturdays on A&AMP;E.

 &HT;    Israel fears Palestinian false hopes
 &HT;    By Don Melvin
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Palestinian expectations following Israel's change of
government this week are dangerously high and need to be reduced to
more realistic proportions, the Israeli ambassador to the United
States said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Palestinians need to understand that this is not a complete
change,'' the ambassador, Zalman Shoval, said during a visit to
Atlanta. ``It isn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Israel's new prime minister, Ehud Barak, has promised to
reinvigorate the search for peace in the Middle East. He embarked
at once on a tour of meetings with other world leaders _ scheduling
meetings with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak on Friday,
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on Sunday and Jordan's King
Abdullah and President Clinton next week.
</P>
<P>
   Barak's vigorous peacemaking activities have made some people in
the region hopeful that peace, so long elusive, can now be quickly
achieved.
</P>
<P>
   But Shoval warned that negotiations to resolve a conflict that
stretches back 100 years, if not thousands, will be long and
difficult, and no one's hopes will be fulfilled completely.
</P>
<P>
   He worried particularly about excessively high expectations
among Palestinians _ hopes that prosperity and a state of their own
are just around the corner.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians need to understand, Shoval said, that Barak will do
nothing to jeopardize Israel's security and that he will demand
that Palestinians greatly increase their compliance with previous
agreements.
</P>
<P>
   The dashing of similarly inflated Palestinian expectations
following the signing of the Oslo peace agreement in 1993 may have
led to increased violence and even terrorism, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The shape and limits of any Palestinian state _ a state Shoval
said he assumes will be anti-Western and anti-Israel _ have yet to
be negotiated. Shoval said, for example, that a Palestinian state
will not be able to form any military alliances.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to have Saddam Hussein in our back yard,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has said that he wants to negotiate peace simultaneously
with the Palestinians and Syrian President Hafez Assad. But Shoval
sounded a note of caution with regard to Syria, too.
</P>
<P>
   He used Winston Churchill's description of Russia _ ``a riddle
wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma'' _ to describe Assad.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody knows what he really wants,'' Shoval said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, an agreement on the status of the Golan Heights, captured
by Israel in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war, could be achieved if
Israel's water rights and security could be assured, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But assuring Israel's security in the event of an agreement
would require the long-term presence of troops from the United
States, or perhaps NATO, the ambassador said. Because even with
peace agreements, various countries in the region will still
distrust one another.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Middle East will continue to be a rather volatile area,''
Shoval said, ``a dangerous neighborhood.

   Viewership ratings for the games leading up to this afternoon's
final against China haven't been as high as they could be, in part,
because of the lack of interest in the team shown by women
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The seven Women's World Cup games on ESPN have drawn an average
of 1.45 percent of the households with cable (1.1 million homes),
and the 22 games on ESPN2 have averaged 0.54 percent (347,700
homes).
</P>
<P>
   Those are hardly boffo numbers, although ESPN executive vice
president Dick Glover said this week that the tournament ``has been
every bit as big an event as we had hoped and thought it would.''
Glover even called the World Cup ``a major milestone for women's
sports.''
</P>
<P>
   And, in fact, Sunday's U.S.-Brazil match was the most-watched
soccer telecast ever on the network.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, overall, only about one-third of the World Cup viewing
audience has been women.
</P>
<P>
   It's not like women don't watch sports on TV. Two-thirds of the
viewers of figure skating events on ESPN, for example, are women.
And, as a percentage of total viewers, women watch NFL football
games as much as they've been watching the Women's World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   So it will be interesting to see the ratings and audience
demographics for today's final, which airs locally on WFAA/Channel
8.
</P>
<P>
   On the hopeful side, the U.S. team, with players like Mia Hamm,
Carla Overbeck, Michelle Akers and Briana Scurry, has been getting
mondo publicity this past week or so, and not just through hair
products commercials. Women as well as men can't avoid the hype.
Maybe they'll tune in.
</P>
<P>
   From the skeptic's perspective, though, a soccer game in the
middle of a weekend afternoon isn't usually the kind of happening
likely to get male or female sports fans to give up a golf date or
a trip to the mall. Who really wants to sit around the living room
and watch soccer on a Saturday afternoon in July, except maybe
those of us trying to stay out of the heat? Clearly, this is a game
that would have its best chance on a weeknight in prime time, but
that isn't about to happen.
</P>
<P>
   A lot has been made of the U.S. team's ability to attract
sellout crowds for its games that have been played across the
country. Today, in Los Angeles, a crowd of 90,000 is expected.
Supporters of soccer and backers of women's sports say that's a
sign of the increased interest in both.
</P>
<P>
   Selling even 90,000 tickets to a one-time sporting event in a
big city where the event becomes a happening is an easier task,
though, than getting people to spend two or three hours at home
watching it on TV. But TV viewership is the truer measure of the
overall interest in soccer, and in women's sports.
</P>
<P>
   The Brazil-U.S. game last weekend was a positive sign. But if
that interest is really growing, we should see record ratings for
today's game, especially among women.

CAPITAL TO GET SCHOOL THAT EMPHASIZES CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Victoria Nedd was looking for a way to keep her
12-year-old son Patrick out of gangs and away from drugs. Then in
early May, a flier arrived in her mailbox that she says had the
answer.
</P>
<P>
   The Hyde Leadership Public Charter School, based in New England,
is scheduled to open in the nation's capital in September and is
looking for students. The school values character development over
ability, and effort over achievement _a teaching style adapted from
the school's predecessors in Bath, Maine, and Woodstock, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're from the inner city, you're always hoping that
something will help your child out,'' said Nedd.
</P>
<P>
   When Nedd decided to enroll Patrick in the seventh grade at
Hyde, she was seeking smaller classes, individualized attention,
and more family involvement.
</P>
<P>
   Although she said her son has always excelled in school, Nedd
was also concerned about peer influence.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never know when someone's going to suck one of your
children into selling drugs,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Nedd wasn't alone. The parents and guardians of more than 140
students in the Washington area, many unhappy with the public
schools here, have chosen to send their children to Hyde. School
officials are reviewing applications throughout the summer and
expect to fill the 240 spots allotted for the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-three years ago, Joseph Gauld founded the Hyde School, a
private boarding school in Bath for ``students who were getting
lost in the shuffle.'' Gauld's educational approach focused more on
the student's character and effort than achievement.
</P>
<P>
   The Hyde school curriculum, which is trademarked as Character
First, departs from traditional emphasis on grades or test scores.
Gauld believes how hard a students tries is just as important as
any test result.
</P>
<P>
   At Hyde, students receive two grades _ one for effort and the
other for achievement. Students are encouraged to help other
students with school work, and they are all required to play a
sport to foster teamwork. There is no such thing as class rank, but
an honor roll for effort is posted every week.
</P>
<P>
   Five words have adorned the school shield since its founding _
courage, integrity, leadership, curiosity, and concern _ to remind
students what they should strive for throughout their lives. And to
help them explore their abilities and goals, students are reminded
to ask themselves a list of questions: Who am I? What am I capable
of? What's holding me back? How do I get where I want to go?
</P>
<P>
   Gauld's approach has paid off _ 97 percent of the graduates from
the Bath school move on to four-year colleges, and over the years
his teaching style has garnered national attention from television
programs such as ``60 Minutes'' and ``20/20.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This approach works because when you focus on a person's
unique potential, you gain their deepest motivation,'' Gauld said
in a phone interview from Bath.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Gauld set up a public magnet school in New Haven,
Conn., and in 1996, he founded another boarding school in
Woodstock, Conn. The school in Washington is the first public
charter school that Gauld has founded.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to show that what is done in a private boarding school
can also be done in a public day school,'' Gauld said.
</P>
<P>
   The school in Washington is currently accepting students for
grades 7 through 9 but plans to expand each year. For the next
academic year, the school will accept up to 420 students in grades
5 through 10. The year after that, the school will take in 570
students in grades 4 through 11. By the year 2003, the school is
hoping to enroll 1,050 students in kindergarten through 12th grade.
</P>
<P>
   Academic requirements will be similar to those at the Bath and
Woodstock schools. In addition to the usual math, science and
English courses, the curriculum will include classes in the
performing arts and athletics, as well as a community service
requirement.
</P>
<P>
   Don MacMillan, headmaster of the Hyde School in Washington, said
he hopes the school's focus on character will bolster the
self-esteem and confidence of his students _ enough to keep them
out of gangs and away from drugs.
</P>
<P>
   He wants to create a school where students support, not
pressure, each other. When teens have the support of their peers,
they will be less likely to try drugs or join gangs, MacMillan
said.

PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFULS CHALLENGED TO GAIN YOUNG VOTE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By EUN LEE KOH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Presidential candidates will have a large new crop
of voters in the 2000 elections _ but they won't be easy to corral.
</P>
<P>
   With nearly 26 million people in the United States between the
ages of 18 and 24, two-thirds of them eligible to vote for the
first time in a presidential election, this generation of young
adults is a giant X-factor in the political arena.
</P>
<P>
   But young voters, even those actively following the presidential
politics, say the candidates are not hitting the right buttons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to hold an ideal view of government,'' said Kelly
Grieco, 20, a sophomore at Dartmouth College. ``I want to believe
that our candidates are qualified, our politicians are honest, and
they are out there to help us.''
</P>
<P>
   Grieco, who was attending a three-day national convention of
College Republicans here this week, is president of the Dartmouth
group backing candidate Elizabeth Dole.
</P>
<P>
   Grieco said the way politics works today is far from her ideal
and turns away college-age voters.
</P>
<P>
   Grieco, who pointedly said she does not want to be labeled a
feminist, explained that gender has nothing to do with her support
for Dole. ``She is not a seasoned politician. Because of that, I
see an enormous amount of integrity in her,'' Grieco said.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Shulman, executive director of the College Democrats of
America _ which will hold its national convention here next week _
said young voters are turned off by the ``game-playing and
glitziness'' of the political process.
</P>
<P>
   ``Students will go out and volunteer for the homeless, they'll
help the environment, because they see themselves affecting change
that way,'' Shulman said. ``But politics has a lot of spin, and
it's not so clear-cut where the change comes from.''
</P>
<P>
   College campuses often attract presidential hopefuls. And with
the New Hampshire primary scheduled for February, plenty of
candidates have made early visits to Granite State colleges,
searching for potential votes and campaign workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Young people can provide that margin of victory for a
candidate,'' said Todd Harris, a spokesman for Representative John
R. Kasich, the Ohio Republican who has appeared at several New
Hampshire colleges already. ``We certainly want to make an appeal
to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Roger Salazar, a spokesman for Vice President Al Gore's
campaign, said, ``Young people add so much energy to the
campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Salazar said the notion that college students are ``apathetic''
is a myth. ``They are just as interested in the future of the
country as older voters are,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Patricia Tarabelsi, a member of the Massachusetts chapter of
College Democrats of America, said candidates do consider students
``apathetic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They know that the base of their votes doesn't come from us,
so they don't aggressively reach out to us as much as they
should,'' said Tarabelsi, 20, a Boston University junior.
</P>
<P>
   George Gunning, 22, who was attending the College Republicans
convention that ends Saturday, said candidates do not address
issues important to students.
</P>
<P>
   ``Students feel far removed from the political process,'' said
Gunning, a senior at Montgomery County Community College in Bell
Town, Penn., who supports Texas Governor George W. Bush. ``They
want to know that the candidates care about issues that students
care about.''
</P>
<P>
   But which issues? These newly minted voters split along party
lines.
</P>
<P>
   Young Democrats, Shulman said, want the new president to toughen
gun-control laws, support abortion rights, and strengthen
environmental protection laws.
</P>
<P>
   Students at the College Republicans convention list education
reform, Social Security, and, as Gunning put it, ``restoring moral
leadership in the presidency.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Values and morality have plummeted with the Clinton
administration,'' Gunning said, referring to President Clinton's
affair with Monica Lewinsky, a former White House intern, which led
to his impeachment and eventual acquittal.
</P>
<P>
   But young Democrats said college students should not focus on
the Clinton sex scandal but on what his administration has
accomplished during the past 6 1/2 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton has done more for college students than what Reagan
and Bush have ever done,'' said Toby Choudhuri, 22, president of
the Massachusetts chapter of College Democrats. ``He's increased
federal grants, basically making higher education more accessible
for everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Young voters-to-be from both parties said they are concerned
about the rising cost of higher education and maintaining a healthy
job market.
</P>
<P>
   ``The immediate really concerns a lot of students,'' Choudhuri
said. ``We are facing some real high costs when it comes to
education, and students worry about how they are going to pay for
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Shulman said candidates will need to convince these first-timers
that they will be voting for someone of substance to run the
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the elections are all said and done, college voters need
to feel like they've chosen a leader, not someone with the
prettiest campaign poster,'' he said.

 &HT;    Delta's new computer system to speed up check-in
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A major technology overhaul at Delta Air Lines is
arriving at the gate.
</P>
<P>
   The airline is rolling out a new check-in computer system
designed to speed passenger processing, shrink lines and give
agents more time to focus on solving customer problems.
</P>
<P>
   Delta this week finished installing the system on concourse D at
Hartsfield International Airport and plans to have the rest of its
gates at the airport converted by this Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   The systems are a key part of a sweeping $500 million upgrade of
the airline's information technology systems, some of which still
employ 20-year-old hardware.
</P>
<P>
   Executives and workers alike say check-in computers were
outdated, hindering the carrier's efforts to deal with passenger
loads.
</P>
<P>
   ``They could put the old computer in the Smithsonian,'' said
concourse D gate agent Dana Godfrey, who called the new system ``a
huge improvement.''
</P>
<P>
   Delta put off big technology upgrades during the early '90s,
when the airline was losing money and restructuring its in-house
computer support division. The division, now a subsidiary called
Delta Technology, developed the software in the new system.
</P>
<P>
   A push to rebuild Delta's business technology was among the
first goals outlined by Chief Executive Leo Mullin when he was
hired in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The updated check-in system also uses new Hewlett-Packard PCs
and beefed-up data networks. Officials say it lays the foundation
for other changes in passenger processing still in the planning
stages.
</P>
<P>
   They include automated rebooking of passengers who miss
connecting flights, along with self-serve check-in kiosks designed
to cut down on lines at counters and gates, said Walter Taylor, a
Delta Technology vice president.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the main focus is on getting the new system up and
running at Hartsfield, Delta's primary hub.
</P>
<P>
   The difference between the old system and the one being
installed is akin to the difference between DOS and Windows on a
home computer.
</P>
<P>
   The old system, like DOS, required agents to type in letter
codes to enter or retrieve information about passengers, seat
availability or the status of connecting flights.
</P>
<P>
   ``They could go digging for what they were looking for, but it
took time and a lot of keystrokes,'' said Chip Houck, manager of
software development for the updated system.
</P>
<P>
   The new system uses a Windows-style display that gives agents
vital information at a glance, along with point-and-click control.
</P>
<P>
   A built-in magnetic stripe reader in the keyboard allows them to
swipe tickets or e-ticket receipts to check-in passengers, rather
than enter their names and information manually.
</P>
<P>
   Seat availability is shown graphically on a ``seat map.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone wants an aisle seat, we can see if it's available
without typing in anything,'' said gate agent Tomeshia Dixon.
</P>
<P>
   Boarding passes are slipped through a bar-code reader, which
automatically compiles passenger counts and alerts agents to
duplicate seat assignments or other anomalies. Flight attendants
will no longer have to help collect boarding cards at the door to
the jetway, freeing them for other preflight tasks.
</P>
<P>
   Delta test-deployed the system at several smaller airports so
glitches could be detected and fixed without affecting the hub.
</P>
<P>
   Troy Stallings, a 33-year veteran passenger service coordinator
at Hartsfield, said some older agents have had predictable gripes
about switching to a new system. But he said he's become a fan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before, we spent all our time counting and recounting boarding
passes and beating the keyboard to death,'' said Stallings. ``This
should allow for more eye-to-eye customer contact.

MOTORCYCLE CRASH INJURIES FATAL TO APOLLO ASTRONAUT CONRAD &HT;   
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   &HT;    By MARK CARREAU
 &HT;    c.1999 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   (UNDATED) Apollo astronaut Charles ``Pete'' Conrad, the third
human to stroll on the moon and later a force in the continuing
efforts to develop low-cost, reusable commercial rockets, has died
of injuries sustained in a California motorcycle accident. He was
69.
</P>
<P>
   A former naval aviator, Conrad logged four sometimes harrowing
spaceflights as part of NASA's Gemini and Apollo programs,
including the first command of a U.S. space station.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the best spacecraft commander I could have hoped for,''
Joe Kerwin, a former astronaut who spent 28 days with Conrad aboard
NASA's Skylab space station in 1973, said Friday. ``He was just a
great team player. He was just a heck of a good communicator and
delegator. He was a good man to work for.''
</P>
<P>
   Space agency installations lowered their flags to half-staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``America has lost one of the great aviators and explorers of
the 20th century,'' said NASA Administrator Dan Goldin.
</P>
<P>
   Conrad died late Thursday at the Ojai Valley Hospital in Ojai,
Calif., northwest of Los Angeles, while undergoing surgery for
internal injuries sustained earlier in the day, according to James
Baroni, the deputy coroner for Ventura County.
</P>
<P>
   A resident of Huntington Beach, a Los Angeles suburb, the former
astronaut was riding a 1996 Harley Davidson motorcycle as he
accompanied his wife, Nancy, and friends on a trip to Monterey.
</P>
<P>
   Conrad apparently lost control of the motorcycle on a winding
segment of highway near Ojai and was thrown off it. He was taken by
ambulance to a hospital in Ojai, where doctors discovered his
injuries included internal bleeding.
</P>
<P>
   During surgery, Conrad was resuscitated after experiencing
cardiac arrest but finally died while in the operating room, Baroni
said.
</P>
<P>
   The astronaut's death comes just days before the 30th
anniversary of the Apollo 11 lunar landing, the July 16-24, 1969,
mission during which Americans Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin
became the first humans to walk on the moon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Among those early astronauts with whom I felt a very close
kinship, Pete was one of those at the top of the list,'' Aldrin
said Friday. ``Pete squeezed the most out of every opportunity to
expand our knowledge and operating skills.''
</P>
<P>
   Conrad's death leaves nine surviving Apollo moonwalkers. Al
Shepard, the first American to fly in space and the fifth to walk
on the moon, died July 21, 1998, following treatment for leukemia.
Jim Irwin, the eighth to wander the lunar landscape, died of a
heart attack on Aug. 8, 1991.
</P>
<P>
   After a distinguished career as a Navy test pilot, Conrad was
among NASA's second group of astronauts selectees, picked in 1962.
</P>
<P>
   Assignments as co-pilot of the 1965 Gemini V mission and
commander of the 1966 Gemini XI mission, in which the crews
established flight duration, altitude and rendezvous milestones,
prepared Conrad for a lunar command.
</P>
<P>
   Apollo 12 blasted off Nov. 14, 1969, demonstrating quickly that
its predecessor did not own the franchise on drama. The spacecraft
was struck by lightning as it soared into the rain clouds, throwing
its electrical systems into turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   After the equipment settled down, NASA cleared Conrad and
colleagues Alan Bean and Richard Gordon to proceed. The lunar
module Intrepid touched down in the moon's Ocean of Storms, with
Conrad and Bean aboard.
</P>
<P>
   The 5-foot-9 Conrad lumbered to the surface of the moon in a
display of jocular wit and competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whoopee!'' he exclaimed ``That may have been a small one for
Neil, but that's a long one for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Four months earlier, the taller Armstrong had electrified the
world as he stepped to the moon's surface for the first time and
announced, ``That's one small step for (a) man; one giant leap for
mankind.''
</P>
<P>
   Apollo 12's crew returned safely to Earth after 31 hours on the
moon and two spacewalks.
</P>
<P>
   Conrad returned to Earth orbit for a final time on May 25, 1973,
commanding Joe Kerwin and Paul Weitz as the first Skylab crew. A
converted Saturn V third stage, Skylab had been launched 11 days
earlier to serve as America's first space station.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   During its ascent, however, the Skylab lost an electrical power
generating solar array and heat shielding.
</P>
<P>
   Conrad's crew in a separate spacecraft mounted a suspenseful
rescue and then spent a record 28 days aboard the outpost.
</P>
<P>
   The first day of the mission proved dramatic as Conrad, before
attempting to dock with the space laboratory, gingerly maneuvered
his Apollo capsule up to the jammed solar array on Skylab. With
Kerwin securing his legs, Weitz leaned from the open capsule,
attempting unsuccessfully to pull the solar array free.
</P>
<P>
   When it was clear the scheme would not work, Conrad attempted
unsuccessfully to dock. Faced with the prospect of making a quick
return to Earth and an aborted mission, the three astronauts
managed to reconfigure their docking system and linkup.
</P>
<P>
   Once safely aboard, Kerwin recalled, Conrad enjoyed regaling his
colleagues with an account of how he should have been one of the
more famous Mercury astronauts. He would have been among the elite
group had a medical expert not misjudged his psychological
suitability for long term spaceflight, Conrad told his crew mates.
</P>
<P>
   ``He felt he had something to prove to the medical community. He
exercised harder than anyone else and strictly observed the dietary
restrictions,'' recalled Kerwin, now the senior vice president of
Wiley Laboratories in Houston. ``The message I got was that he
would show that guy who was psychologically fit, which he did.''
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks into their Skylab stay, Conrad and Kerwin teamed up
for a spacewalk that freed the jammed solar array, providing
much-needed power to America's first home in space.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Conrad left the space agency and NASA in 1974 to pursue a career
in business, first serving as vice president for a cable television
company.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, though, he was back in aerospace, joining McDonnell
Douglas Corp. and eventually taking on responsibility for the
commercial and military aircraft sales of the Douglas Aircraft Co.
Later, McDonnell Douglas merged with the larger Boeing Co.
</P>
<P>
   Before his retirement in 1995, Conrad served as flight manager
for the DC-X, a futuristic prototype for a reusable rocket. Conrad
supervised flight tests in the New Mexico desert for the rocket,
which garnered a cult following.
</P>
<P>
   In retirement, Conrad formed his own company, Universal Space
Lines, with the hope of opening up space to commercial users.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, Conrad's survivors include three sons.

   Expectations are pretty high as the second-quarter earnings
season gets into full swing this week, with reports scheduled from
Intel, Apple Computer, International Paper, Merrill Lynch, Pfizer,
Whirlpool, Weyerhaeuser and others.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street analysts who make forecasts for the 500 companies in
the Standard &AMP; Poor's stock index are predicting the first
double-digit growth in quarterly corporate earnings since the end
of 1997. IBES International, which tracks earnings, is forecasting
10 percent overall growth, based on its compilation of analysts'
predictions, while First Call Corp., the other leading compiler of
earnings, predicts 11.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the optimism is the gentleness of the pre-announcement
season, often a rocky run-up when many companies warn investors of
profit disappointments to come. There have been 270 negative
announcements so far, according to First Call; that total is no
worse than normal. The only ``blockbuster announcement,'' said
Chuck Hill, the director of research at First Call, was Compaq
Computer's warning in June that it expected a second-quarter loss
of as much as 15 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the number of downward revisions of analysts'
earnings estimates, which commonly occur before the beginning of a
reporting season, has been smaller than normal for the second
quarter. The current First Call forecast of 11.2 percent earnings
growth, compared with the second quarter last year, is down from
13.9 percent six months ago. That is a much smaller cut than in the
first quarter of this year, when the initial 14.3 percent forecast
was slashed to 5.7 percent. A trim of four percentage points is the
norm, Hill said.
</P>
<P>
   And companies that have already reported earnings, including
General Electric, Yahoo and Alcoa, have provided good news.
</P>
<P>
   All of this has led Hill to suggest that by the time all the
second-quarter reports are in, the actual jump in earnings,
compared with the second quarter of 1998, will be closer to 15
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The strength of the numbers is reassuring in a period when
interest rates could move higher. The Federal Reserve, which has
already raised rates once, could raise them again later this
summer.
</P>
<P>
   The good earnings prospects (analysts think that the third and
fourth quarters will be even stronger) also help investors live
with the fact that prices are high for many stocks, by historical
standards. According to IBES, stocks have been too pricey for 29
consecutive weeks, the longest overvaluation streak since before
the 1987 crash.
</P>
<P>
   But remember that a lot of the punch in the earnings numbers is
not from a new surge in growth, but from a rebound from setbacks _
or even sharp losses _ in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   For example, General Motors, according to IBES estimates, will
show a surge in operating earnings in the second quarter, to $2.55
a share, compared with 54 cents a share in the corresponding period
last year. (Operating earnings are adjusted to remove the impact of
write-offs and other one-time items and are therefore different
from reported earnings.)
</P>
<P>
   But the GM gain represents mostly a rebound from sales lost
during a strike that crippled production last year. Before cutting
estimates because of the strike, analysts expected GM to earn $2.27
a share in last year's second quarter. Without GM's sharp expected
gain, the overall IBES second-quarter growth forecast would drop to
8.8 percent from 10.2 percent, according to Joseph Abbott, United
States research manager at IBES.
</P>
<P>
   Intel is also expected to rebound, to operating earnings of 54
cents a share, from 33 cents in the period a year earlier, when
chip prices were being cut. Without Intel and GM, the IBES growth
forecast would be cut to 8.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Easy quarterly comparisons also help in the next two quarters.
GM is expected to surge again. And with oil prices 47 percent above
the average for the last two quarters of 1998, energy sector
profits, according to First Call, should jump 39 percent in the
third quarter and 77 percent in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Banks and brokerage firms also ought to do well in the third
quarter, compared with the disastrous results during the financial
turmoil that followed the Russian ruble devaluation and bond
default last August.
</P>
<P>
   So don't get too excited about the return to double-digit profit
increases.

FOR HILLARY CLINTON, A NEW BEGINNING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYRACUSE, N.Y. _ In the middle of her maiden voyage across
upstate New York this week, Hillary Rodham Clinton suddenly began
to muse that the tour was marking not only the start of a possible
Senate campaign but the start of a new life _ the first time, after
nearly 25 years in her husband's aura, that she was striking out on
her own.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters, she noted that she has been a lawyer
speaking on behalf of clients and causes, a politician's wife and
First Lady speaking on behalf of her husband and other candidates.
But, she said, ``It is a different feeling to be the person who is
in the spotlight ... speaking on my own behalf.'' This tour, she
went on, ``was the first time I had ever done it ... I loved what I
did ... I had a wonderful time.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest surprise of this Senate race _ already expected to
one of the tightest, best-funded, and most-watched contests of 2000
_ may be the emergence of a Hillary Clinton that few have ever
before seen.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the image has begun to shift. Shedding the emotional
armor she donned during a year of White House scandal, she has
plunged into crowds like a veteran campaigner. Famously versed in
policy details, she has spent much of her time asking her audiences
for their views and ideas. (She's calling this stage of her
campaign a ``listening tour.'')
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most remarkable, this woman with a well-honed aversion
to criticism _ particularly from the press _ started the trip by
acknowledging that her critics' most politically potent complaint _
that she's a ``carpetbagger'' who has never lived or worked in the
state _ has some validity.
</P>
<P>
   At every step along the way, from Oneonta to Cooperstown to
Utica to Syracuse to Albany and several still smaller towns in
between, Mrs. Clinton has gushed about how ``excited'' she was to
be there, how avidly she wanted to hear what people had to say.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a really good idea,'' she said Friday, at a high-tech
center in Rome, N.Y., when one businessman suggested subsidizing
developers for the cost of demolishing dilapidated factory
buildings.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is why I love these listening sessions _ I never would
have known about this,'' she beamed to a dairy farmer who talked
about the need for technical help in complying with federal
regulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The enthusiasm of the crowds clearly excited her,'' said
Judith Hope, chairwoman of the New York State Democratic Party.
``We always saw the spark; now we see the fire.''
</P>
<P>
   She has parted from President Clinton's views on some matters,
though carefully. At every forum, she has referred, at one point or
another, to a bill that ``my husband'' signed or proposed. However,
Friday, she endorsed the Northeast Dairy Compact, which would raise
prices for milk products _ while her husband's administration has
proposed a different method of helping dairy farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, before coming upstate, she also lobbied against a
provision in the president's welfare bill that would take away
money from New York's teaching hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   The election still lies 16 months away, and, one of her aides
said, she will continue well into the next year doing what she has
done this week -- speaking to small groups, showing that she knows
the issues of the state and wants to learn more.
</P>
<P>
   Once the press core dwindles _ and this was already happening by
the end of the tour Friday _ she also plans to campaigning going
door to door, a classic brand of ``retail politics'' that served
her husband well when he was a state office-seeker in Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   The explicit strategy is to build up enough exposure and enough
of a presence so that, by the time the debates begin and the
election heats up, she will know at least as much about New York as
any politician in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Patty Timmerman, a small businesswoman who attended one
gathering, said afterward, ``I'm a registered Republican, but I
think I'll vote for her. I didn't think I would before I came
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Polls show Mrs. Clinton running neck and neck statewide with her
likely Republican opponent, New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani _
clearly leading in the predominantly Democratic city then trailing
in the more conservative environs upstate and in the suburbs of
Long Island and Westchester counties.
</P>
<P>
   This is why she started her ``exploratory'' campaign upstate and
why, next week, she plans to tour the suburbs.

 &HT;    `Concrete ceiling' stops minority career women
 &HT;    By David McNaughton
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Breaking through the ``glass ceiling'' that separates
most women from the top jobs in corporate America is tough enough.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to crack what minority women call a ``concrete ceiling''
is even harder _ enough so that those women have become more
pessimistic about their chances for advancement, a national report
due Tuesday will suggest.
</P>
<P>
   ``While white women talk about a `glass ceiling,' women of color
perceive that the barriers they encounter, which they characterize
as a `concrete ceiling,' are more dense and less easily
shattered,'' a draft of the report by New York-based Catalyst says.
</P>
<P>
   The report is the third in Catalyst's three-year study of
minority women in corporate management. The first report covered
demographics. The second, released last year, contained preliminary
findings from a survey of more than 1,700 African-American,
Asian-American and Hispanic women managers and professionals
working for American companies.
</P>
<P>
   This year's report discloses how that group of women views the
companies for which they work, in terms of work environment and
diversity efforts.
</P>
<P>
   While nearly half of the minority women surveyed think
opportunities for them have increased over the last five years, 38
percent see no change. In fact, according to the draft, minority
women are ``questioning the wisdom of continuing to pursue a career
in the corporate private sector.''
</P>
<P>
   The major barriers they see to advancement, the report says,
are:
</P>
<P>
   _ Lack of an influential mentor or sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   _ Lack of networking with influential colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   _ Lack of role models of the same race within a company.
</P>
<P>
   _ Lack of high-visibility assignments.
</P>
<P>
   White women see some of the same barriers, the draft report
says, but rank them differently in order of importance than do
minority women.
</P>
<P>
   Stereotyping of women by males and exclusion from informal
networks are cited by white women as being among the biggest
barriers to advancement. Minority women rank the absence of an
influential mentor at the top of the list.
</P>
<P>
   The full report by Catalyst, which works to advance women in
business, will be released in New York.

DEMAND FOR CT SCANS SURGES AFTER STUDY FINDS EARLY DETECTION OF
LUNG CANCER
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Colo., Minn, N.Y.)  (rk) 
 By DENISE GRADY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After reading Friday morning about a new study by
researchers at Cornell Medical Center showing that CT scans could
provide early detection of lung cancer in smokers and former
smokers, Richard Bauer called Cornell to find out when he could
have the test.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as I can make arrangements, I'll be on the next
plane,'' Bauer said.
</P>
<P>
   Many other people had the same idea. By midmorning, the voice
mail system at Cornell's chest scanning center in Manhattan was
full and could record no more messages. A secretary said that since
8 a.m., she had done little but answer calls from patients wanting
scans.
</P>
<P>
   New York University, which participated in the study, reported a
similar flood of calls. The Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., which
announced its own study of the scans a few weeks ago, received more
than 3,000 phone calls within a few days.
</P>
<P>
   ``The demand for appointments far exceeds our capacity,'' said
Dr. Stephen Swensen, chairman of the department of radiology at the
Mayo Clinic.
</P>
<P>
   The study that provoked the excitement on Friday appears in the
current issue of The Lancet journal, a British medical publication.
In it, doctors from Cornell and New York University report that new
CT scan technology allows them to detect lung cancers early enough
for many of them to be successfully treated.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, doctors have not routinely screened people for lung
cancer because X-rays could not detect tumors in time to cure them,
or significantly prolong patients' lives.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer, a 67-year-old former Navy pilot who lives in Vail, Colo.,
said he had smoked off and on since he was 18, ``probably never
more than a pack a day.'' He finally quit about 10 years ago, but
always wondered whether all those years of smoking would catch up
with him anyway.
</P>
<P>
   At annual physicals, he would ask his doctor if there was some
test that could find lung cancer early enough for it to be cured.
But the doctor would just shrug.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have no idea how much smokers wondered why there hasn't
been a diagnostic technique,'' Bauer said.
</P>
<P>
   For smokers or former smokers who want to be tested, Swensen
said that age 50 was a reasonable time to consider having a first
scan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The incidence of lung cancer starts rising dramatically at
50,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But researchers cautioned that people need to understand what
they are getting into by having a scan. In the Lancet study, CT
scans of the lungs in 1,000 patients showed abnormal nodules in
233, nearly a quarter of the patients.
</P>
<P>
   Small nodules were not biopsied or removed immediately, but
patients were given a repeat scan a few months later. Only nodules
that grew were considered cancerous and referred for surgery.
Ultimately, just 27 of the 233 patients with nodules turned out to
have cancer.
</P>
<P>
   It is a cause for concern that so many patients had nodules,
said Dr. Barnett Kramer, deputy director of the division of cancer
prevention at the National Cancer Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Though the doctors who conducted the study operated only on
patients with cancer, Kramer said it was not clear whether other
medical centers would be able to tell benign nodules from malignant
ones so accurately. If they cannot, he said, some patients may
needlessly undergo risky biopsies and operations.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he said, some will be needlessly frightened. ``One
in four people will be told there is something to worry about,'' he
said. ``At the very least, if it doesn't lead to major surgery, it
will lead to coming in much more frequently, and living with the
abnormality.''
</P>
<P>
   Kramer also said that though the lead author of the study, Dr.
Claudia I. Henschke of Cornell, had suggested that CT scans could
increase lung cancer survival from 12 percent to 80 percent, that
had not been proved.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real goal is to save lives, and the study design in the
Lancet isn't really able to show definitively that it saves
lives,'' Kramer said. ``The gold standard is to do a randomized
trial, and compare the death rate of those who get screened to
those who don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of those concerns, he said, it was too early to
recommend widespread use of the CT scans.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I want to emphasize that we're excited,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David P. Naidich, director of thoracic imaging at New York
University Medical Center and a co-author of the Lancet study,
agreed that he and his colleagues had to determine whether the CT
scans really could save lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe we will affect mortality, but it remains to be
proved,'' Naidich said. Until there is proof, he added, patients
who want scans should be told they are experimental.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers said that insurers now refused to cover the
procedure, which costs about $300 per scan. Naidich said he thought
it would take three to five years to convince them that it was
worthwhile. And he and Henschke said they would like to see money
from lawsuits against the tobacco industry used to cover the cost
of screening for current and former smokers.

A HEYDAY FOR FRAUD IN THE BULL MARKET 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sun., July 11)

 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Another day, another $100 million lost by investors
to securities fraud.
</P>
<P>
   An exaggeration, of course. But judging from the cases streaming
out of prosecutors' offices recently, it seems as if securities
fraud rivals the Internet as the nation's hottest growth industry.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, a small brokerage firm called A.S. Goldmen and 33
individuals associated with it were indicted on charges of
securities fraud. Robert Morgenthau, the Manhattan district
attorney, said investors lost $100 million with the firm. Goldmen
employees committed just about every bad act in the book, he said,
including stock manipulation, lying to investors, unauthorized
trading and forgery of documents. The lawyer for the firm's owners
said they would be exonerated.
</P>
<P>
   The growth in securities cases has kept Morgenthau's office
humming. In the past 18 months, he has brought nine cases against
94 individuals. Nor is the problem limited to New York. Investor
inquiries and complaints to the Securities and Exchange Commission
rose 11.6 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   There's a simple reason for a bull market in fraud _ the bull
market in stocks. Investors hearing of wondrous sums made in the
market are eager to generate their own profits and easily gulled
about what they can expect an investment to earn. When the Standard
&AMP; Poor's 500 rises more than 20 percent for five consecutive years,
it's easier to believe a crook's claim about doubling your money on
a hot stock.
</P>
<P>
   Greed, of course, is at the bottom of these mishaps. But many
crooks are so good at their craft that even a hardened skeptic
might be convinced. Besides, who doesn't want to increase profits?
</P>
<P>
   Consider the story that Viva Wolhar, a teacher in Newark, Del.,
says she told the prosecutors. When an A.S. Goldmen broker called
her in late 1997 with an investment idea, she thought it might
bolster the $9,000 she had saved for her daughter's wedding and the
$25,000 she had in a retirement account.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was told they were going to build a golf stadium in Naples
with the money and that they had the sanction of the senior tour,''
she recalled. ``It seemed to make sense to me.'' She lost $33,761.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, investors are vulnerable today. Which makes a proposal
to reduce registration requirements for brokers _ made by the
Securities Industry Association, Wall Street's lobbying group _
puzzling at best. Senator Phil Gramm, the Texas Republican who
ischairman of the Banking Committee, is looking at whether to
include it in his Securities Markets Enhancement Act of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal would change the current state-by-state
registration system for stockbrokers, allowing a broker to operate
nationwide as long as he or she was cleared in one state. Stuart
Kaswell, general counsel of the industry group, said it would
eliminate redundancy.
</P>
<P>
   But state securities regulators say it would encourage scofflaw
brokers to set up operations in the state with the smallest
regulatory staff and then make cold calls to investors across the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph P. Borg, director of the Alabama Securities Commission,
said 75 percent of brokers registered in Alabama are from out of
state. In the last 18 months, his staff questioned the applications
of some 350 brokers; 300 of them withdrew. ``Under this proposal,
I'll have no gatekeeping function.'' he said.

GORDON EARNS POLE POSITION IN JIFFY LUBE EVENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUDON, N.H. _ All day long, Jeff Gordon gave chase to the
perfect lap, struggling to find the perfect line around the tricky
mile oval at New Hampshire International Speedway, only to discover
his No. 24 Dupont-sponsored Chevrolet Monte Carlo was a tick off
the pace during Friday's NASCAR Winston Cup practice session.
</P>
<P>
   So, when Gordon asked his crew chief, Ray Evernham, ``about
freeing it up,'' the three-time and defending Winston Cup champion
was caught by complete surprise when his car responded with a
record-shattering hot lap of 131.171 miles per hour that landed him
on the pole position for Sunday's Jiffy Lube 300 at NHIS.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys on this team did a great job today,'' Gordon said,
saluting his Rainbow Warriors after he captured his sixth Bud Pole
Award of the season. ``We were really quick most of the day, but
never got that lap I needed. We just fine-tuned, fine-tuned all day
long. I talked to these guys, especially Ray, about freeing it up
just a little bit. Man, they did, and the car was just perfect. It
was so perfect, I didn't think the lap was that good.''
</P>
<P>
   It turned out to be plenty good.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, a three-time winner at NHIS who became the fourth driver
in track history to win four pole positions (Mark Martin, Ricky
Craven, and Ken Schrader were the others), toppled Rusty Wallace
from the provisional pole, relegating him to the outside pole
position.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Labonte qualified third fastest with Schrader fourth
fastest.
</P>
<P>
   Dale Earnhardt Jr., making his second of five scheduled Winston
Cup appearances this season, overcame a chipped right shoulder
blade to qualify 13th, just a tick faster than his father, who
qualified 14th fastest.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace, driver of the No. 2 Miller Lite Ford Taurus, was first
out in the qualifying lineup and blistered the track with a lap of
130.770 m.p.h. that easily bettered Schrader's 2-year-old
qualifying record of 129.423 m.p.h. In all, 17 drivers wound up
surpassing Schrader's qualifying record, with Gordon establishing
the new standard with his pole-winning run.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just went through the corners so nice that I thought I
didn't drive hard enough,'' Gordon said. ``At this place, it's
knowing when to be aggressive and when to be patient in qualifying.
You've got to be aggressively patient, and I'm really thrilled
about that run.''
</P>
<P>
   So, too, was Wallace, who was mindful of the rotten luck that
had befallen many a driver in their early qualifying attempts at
NHIS.
</P>
<P>
   ``My car handled great and I was real happy with the speed,''
Wallace said. ``I had a lot of concern going into qualifying
because if you look at the history of this racetrack, everybody who
goes out early really has a tough time qualifying. I was talking to
the crew guys and I said, `Hey, nobody's been on the racetrack
since the last practice. It's pretty cool out and the track should
be pretty consistent. I'm just gonna have confidence in the track
and go out and drive hard.' And I did.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallace took a decidedly different approach than Gordon's
``aggressively patient'' strategy when, he said, ``I just decided
to bomb it in there in the first turn like I had been doing in
practice, because if you're timid going into Turn 1, then you're
not going to have enough speed to contend for the pole.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Gordon, ``I'd been pushing most of the day and expected it
to do the same thing. I drove the car in pretty deep into (Turn)
one but was trying not to get in there too hot. The car turned
really nice for me in the middle and kind of caught me by surprise.
I got back on the gas and the thing drove off hard. I said, `All
right, this thing is really hooked up,' It was just one of those
deals where it didn't feel like it was a pole-type of lap.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was good enough to be perfect. Just perfect.

REVOLUTION COACH SAYS HOME FIELD WILL HELP US

   WELLESLEY, Mass. _ Revolution coaches and players are supporting
the US against China in Saturday's Women's World Cup final. But
some of them advise not betting heavily against the Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   Walter Zenga, the Revolution's player-coach, a goalkeeper on two
World Cup finals teams and an Olympic team, said the Rose Bowl
home-field advantage should make the difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``The US is very strong, even though the country hasn't had a
professional league,'' Zenga said Friday. ``The US has two or three
players who are really excellent. Both teams are very strong. But
in tournaments, the home team has an advantage. The US will get
extra motivation from being at home, from playing in front of its
fans.''
</P>
<P>
   But Zenga also knows that the pressure of high expectations can
difficult. Italians turned against Zenga after he allowed a goal
against Argentina as Italy was eliminated in the semifinals of the
1990 World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Zenga and assistant coach Giuseppe Galderisi have something in
common with US forward Mia Hamm. All three had their first soccer
experiences in Italy. Hamm took her first soccer steps in Le
Cascine, the main park in Florence, where her father was stationed
in the military in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way the US plays together is great,'' said Galderisi, who
played for Italy in the 1986 World Cup. ``They have a winning
philosophy. There is a great atmosphere within the team, they all
want to fight, to suffer, to do everything together. I have to say
they play very good soccer, and this World Cup has been good not
for just the women's team but for soccer in America. I predict the
US wins, 2-1, goals by Mia Hamm and Julie Foudy.
(itals)Forza(unitals) USA.''
</P>
<P>
   Midfielder John Harkes, who seldom evades a question, refused to
predict the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope the US wins,'' said Harkes, who played for the US in
the 1990 and '94 World Cup. ``But China is a strong team and they
were very impressive in beating Norway, 5-nil.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Revolution players were pro-US:
</P>
<P>
   --``This will be the US's toughest game but I'm confident the US
can pull it out. China has played well but the US is still the best
team in the world.'' _ Joe-Max Moore, a World Cup participant in
1994 and '98
</P>
<P>
   --``I hope the US wins but if China plays the way they did
against Norway it will be very hard. China is so confident and the
way they keep the ball is impressive.'' _ midfielder Paulo Dos
Santos
</P>
<P>
   --``It's going to be a great game. I'd like to see the US win
but they are going to have a tough time with China. China is a very
athletic team but if the US takes it to them it will be just a
matter of time.'' _ forward Johnny Torres
</P>
<P>
   --``I like China's speed. They were flying by Norway. But the US
has enough speed to match them. I'll say 2-1 the US wins. Both
goalkeepers are on and China's goalkeeper had better be on because
the US has shown they can pick up scraps _ when Brazil's goalkeeper
dropped the ball they were on it in a second.'' _ goalkeeper Jeff
Causey

   MUZAFFARABAD, Kashmir _ Six holy warriors were buried here
Friday beside an apricot tree in Martyr's Square. Their bodies did
not require any of the usual ritual washing or the cover of a white
shroud. They were placed in their graves just as they had fallen,
martyrs already ascended into heaven.
</P>
<P>
   The young men were blown apart in battle by artillery fire a few
miles from here. They were not well known, but 2,000 people came to
their funeral under a brutal morning sun. Martyrdom is treated
quite momentously in this city. The special burial plot lies before
the National Assembly and beside the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Muzaffarabad is the capital of what is known in Pakistan as
Azad, or liberated, Kashmir; the Indians know it as
Pakistan-occupied territory. Outside of town, along a route that
winds through the breathtaking green of the lower Himalayas, the
same hand-lettered words appear again and again on rocky walls
beside the road: Martyrdom is our motto.
</P>
<P>
   As the ``Kargil jihad,'' the two-month war for strategic
mountain tops in the area that India controls, was being celebrated
in Muzaffarabad, it was being deflated 80 miles away in Islamabad,
the Pakistani capital. Fulfilling a pledge made by Prime Minister
Nawaz Sharif last weekend in Washington, the Pakiani government
officially appealed to the Mujahideen, or holy warriors, to end the
fighting on the windswept peaks.
</P>
<P>
   Sharif had met for two hours with his top military and civilian
leaders. Afterward, in a statement, the group asked the militants
to pull back to ``provide an opportunity for the international
community to play an active role'' in solving the 52-year-old
dispute over Kashmir. Foreign Secretary Shamshad Ahmed Khan
emphasized that President Clinton had promised ``to take a personal
interest.''
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister then met with a delegation of Mujahideen
groups. Some later took a wait-and-see attitude while others
rebuffed his entreaty outright. ``We don't accept any Washington
accord and are not concerned with appeals from the government of
Pakistan,'' said Abdul Ahad, a spokesman for Al-Badr Mujahideen.
</P>
<P>
   The funeral in Muzaffarabad itself seemed a flat rejection of
Sharif's proposal. ``We started the holy war based on our trust in
God, not the governments of Pakistan or the United States,'' said
Ahmed Hamza of Al-Badr Mujahideen, addressing the crowd.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Five of the coffins rested on the ground together. The dead
belonged to the group Tehrik-e-Jihad. Dozens of its soldiers, in
camouflage fatigues with long-tailed kufiya atop their heads,
marched with precision. Before any prayers were recited, speeches
were made, amplified through a sound truck. Mourning was secondary
to exhortation.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the will of Allah, we will start dozens of Kargils,'' said
Saleem Wani, a leader of the Tehrik-e-Jihad.
</P>
<P>
   A chant began in response. ``God is great!''
</P>
<P>
   For weeks, India has been portraying the Mujahideen as rather
feckless rebels being led into battle by Pakistani army regulars.
Each day in New Delhi, the military announces a new string of
victories and a lopsided death toll.
</P>
<P>
   In Muzaffarabad, that claim is turned inside out. The Mujahideen
claim that the holy war is entirely their own, and the Pakistanis
mere allies. As for how the fighting is going, they say the Indians
are taking a drubbing.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Indians boasts were truth, the war would be over,
wouldn't it?'' said Nazir Hussain Shah, 30, a Mujahideen soldier on
leave. ``We are Kashmiris and these mountains are our homes. We are
used to fighting up here. We took those peaks in February, in the
most bitter part of winter, and we are completely prepared to stay
when winter comes again.''
</P>
<P>
   However the Kargil campaign turns out, it would seem the
Mujahideen struggle for Kashmir is destined for a long life. It
combines the patriot's love of a land with the religious zealot's
sense of righteousness and the oppressed's storehouse of hatred.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the men buried Friday _ Mohammad Aslam Shah, Nazir
Ahmed Qureshi and Altaf Ahmed Shah _ came from families that had
fled Indian Kashmir in 1990 and ended up in the Ambor refugee camp
outside Muzaffarabad.
</P>
<P>
   Ambor, once seen as a stopover, is now a settlement, its 3,000
residents having gouged space out of a mountainside and piled hovel
atop hovel. Steep paths, barely two feet wide, divide one row of
single-room homes from another. The better-off have tin roofs, but
most people live under ill-fitting wooden planks. At any given
time, hundreds of the young men are fighting the jihad. Every house
has someone who has lost a husband, a child or a limb.
</P>
<P>
   In Altaf Ahmed Shah's house, grieving uncles and cousins were
repeating tales of Indian ``tortures and atrocities'' that had
driven them from the village of Karnah Bahadur Kot nine years ago.
Noor Ali Shah had embarked on the story of his missing right leg
when a very old man began to shout and ambled in, poking with a
cane.
</P>
<P>
   With skinny legs and a stooped frame, Kapur Ali Shah, who said
he was 120 years old, looked like a slowly moving question mark.
``Since 1947, we have been asking for our independence,'' he
screamed as people reached to steady him. ``We have asked for it
and asked for it and asked for it. We ask for it still!''
</P>
<P>
   In 1947, the year that India and Pakistan were carved from the
British Empire, the two infant nations went to war over the jeweled
land that lay between them. Kashmir, predominantly Muslim, seemed
essential to both of their identities _ proof that secular India
could accommodate all faiths, and proof that Pakistan was the
Islamic homeland for the region.
</P>
<P>
   A half century and two other wars later, Kashmir remains the
chief issue that keeps both countries loathing the other. Pakistan
controls about a third of Kashmir as a protectorate; the Indian
state of Jammu and Kashmir includes most of the rest.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, a violent separatist movement shook Indian Kashmir. The
Indians blamed the Pakistanis for fomenting the rebellion. The
Pakistanis and many human rights groups blamed the Indians for
stifling dissent and insurrection in a brutal manner.
</P>
<P>
   Khanum Jan, the mother of Nazir Ahmed Qureshi, one of those
buried Friday, said she lost another son, her eldest, during the
violence in 1990. She has one son left. ``All my boys are willing
to die for the struggle,'' she said in a low murmur.
</P>
<P>
   Mohammad Aslam Shah was also the second son in his family to be
``martyred.'' Maskeen Shah, his father, Friday recalled what had
made him flee to Azad Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our women were raped,'' he said. ``They tear-gassed us. They
shot at us. The looted our properties. I was tortured with
electricity, strung upside down.''
</P>
<P>
   He sat cross-legged on the floor and as he talked his lips
trembled and his eyes got teary. But he refused to accept
condolences.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a happy man today,'' he insisted. ``The title of
martyrdom does not come easily. And I am proud of my son for dying
for our cause.''
</P>
<P>
   He reached out his left arm and pulled a baby onto his lap. The
boy, his grandson, is 5 months old and now fatherless.
</P>
<P>
   ``Soon,'' he said, propping the baby onto his toes and forcing a
smile, ``this little one will be ready for jihad.''

   FORT WORTH, Texas _ You promised yourself you would be good to
them.
</P>
<P>
   You promised you would keep them in their cases, away from the
kids, away from the dog, away from the litter box, away from your
sports-loving friends who come over and turn your place into Animal
House mistaking them for beer coasters.
</P>
<P>
   You are a liar.
</P>
<P>
   There you are, listening to your favorite Whiskeytown CD _ which
is, of course, ``Strangers Almanac'' _ and right when you get to
the part where singer Ryan Adams cries the chorus of Losering, you
hear this:
</P>
<P>
   ``Loo, loo, loo, ser, ser, ser, ing, ing, ing.''
</P>
<P>
   It's skip city.
</P>
<P>
   Infuriated, you pull the disc out of the player and freak when
you see little scars running down its back. Looks like someone bit
it, which explains why your kid just left the room. That's $17 down
the drain.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe not.
</P>
<P>
   If the scratch isn't too bad, there's a chance the disc can be
patched up and sound as good as new.
</P>
<P>
   This is thanks to a new service called ``rebuffing.'' said Craig
Crafton, manager of CDX used CD store in Hurst, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The top layer of a CD is just plastic, and rebuffing basically
shaves off a very small amount of that plastic,'' he says. ``CDs
that have light scratches and scuff marks can be cleaned up to
brand-new quality.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all scratches are repairable, though.
</P>
<P>
   ``Data is stored in the metal layer of a CD, so if a scratch
cuts through to the metal, it's history,'' Crafton says. ``CD
machine laser beams go through the plastic to read the data on the
metal. If there's too big a mark on the metal, the beam won't read
it. But most marks aren't that serious.''
</P>
<P>
   Rebuffing also works for CD-ROMs, DVDs and Sony PlayStation
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything on CD can be done,'' he says. ``It's all the same
technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Crafton's store performs the service for $3-$4, depending on the
amount of damage. The discs are sent to an outside company, and it
takes about a week to get your CD back.
</P>
<P>
   Other stores, such as Sound Source in North Richland Hills and
the two CD Worlds in Dallas, have purchased the rebuffing units,
which can cost up to $10,000, and are performing the surgery
on-site.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people have scratched CDs, so it's been great for
them,'' says Jeff Stout, owner of Sound Source CD shops in Bedford
and North Richland Hills. ``Rather than replace them, you can
repair them. It costs less than a third for a new CD.''
</P>
<P>
   Sound Source charges $4 a disc or $3 each for three or more
while you wait.
</P>
<P>
   Local entrepreneur Dave Gebhart and Fort Worth rock singer Ezra
Boggs were two of the first North Texans to take advantage of this
new technology. A year ago, they started a company called Disc
Doctors and began working with CD shops that needed their used CDs
repaired.
</P>
<P>
   Disc Doctors now offers the service to individual customers
through the CD Warehouse in Irving. They're hoping to expand to
other CD Warehouses, including the stores in Arlington and Fort
Worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just kind of stumbled on this technology,'' Gebhart says.
``We hadn't heard of anyone doing it before, so we gave it a shot,
and it's taken off. Obviously, we can't work miracles. If your CD
is cracked, it's hopeless. But we are changing our technology to
get the deeper stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Some CD owners may balk at rebuffing, choosing to stick to the
old-school way of repairing their discs: with polishes and creams.
</P>
<P>
   That's fine, says Craig Crafton, but be prepared to have bigger
problems down the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``That stuff doesn't really repair them,'' he says. ``It
temporarily fills in the scratches, but using that ... is kind of
reverse stupidity. You put that cream on your CD, it gets in your
CD player and it messes it up. So you have a CD that works, but a
player that doesn't.''

PRESIDENTIAL HOPEFULS CHALLENGED TO GAIN YOUNG VOTE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By EUN LEE KOH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Presidential candidates will have a large new crop
of voters in the 2000 elections _ but they won't be easy to corral.
</P>
<P>
   With nearly 26 million people in the United States between the
ages of 18 and 24, two-thirds of them eligible to vote for the
first time in a presidential election, this generation of young
adults is a giant X-factor in the political arena.
</P>
<P>
   But young voters, even those actively following the presidential
politics, say the candidates are not hitting the right buttons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to hold an ideal view of government,'' said Kelly
Grieco, 20, a sophomore at Dartmouth College. ``I want to believe
that our candidates are qualified, our politicians are honest, and
they are out there to help us.''
</P>
<P>
   Grieco, who was attending a three-day national convention of
College Republicans here this week, is president of the Dartmouth
group backing candidate Elizabeth Dole.
</P>
<P>
   Grieco said the way politics works today is far from her ideal
and turns away college-age voters.
</P>
<P>
   Grieco, who pointedly said she does not want to be labeled a
feminist, explained that gender has nothing to do with her support
for Dole. ``She is not a seasoned politician. Because of that, I
see an enormous amount of integrity in her,'' Grieco said.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Shulman, executive director of the College Democrats of
America _ which will hold its national convention here next week _
said young voters are turned off by the ``game-playing and
glitziness'' of the political process.
</P>
<P>
   ``Students will go out and volunteer for the homeless, they'll
help the environment, because they see themselves affecting change
that way,'' Shulman said. ``But politics has a lot of spin, and
it's not so clear-cut where the change comes from.''
</P>
<P>
   College campuses often attract presidential hopefuls. And with
the New Hampshire primary scheduled for February, plenty of
candidates have made early visits to Granite State colleges,
searching for potential votes and campaign workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Young people can provide that margin of victory for a
candidate,'' said Todd Harris, a spokesman for Representative John
R. Kasich, the Ohio Republican who has appeared at several New
Hampshire colleges already. ``We certainly want to make an appeal
to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Roger Salazar, a spokesman for Vice President Al Gore's
campaign, said, ``Young people add so much energy to the
campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Salazar said the notion that college students are ``apathetic''
is a myth. ``They are just as interested in the future of the
country as older voters are,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Patricia Tarabelsi, a member of the Massachusetts chapter of
College Democrats of America, said candidates do consider students
``apathetic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They know that the base of their votes doesn't come from us,
so they don't aggressively reach out to us as much as they
should,'' said Tarabelsi, 20, a Boston University junior.
</P>
<P>
   George Gunning, 22, who was attending the College Republicans
convention that ends Saturday, said candidates do not address
issues important to students.
</P>
<P>
   ``Students feel far removed from the political process,'' said
Gunning, a senior at Montgomery County Community College in Bell
Town, Penn., who supports Texas Governor George W. Bush. ``They
want to know that the candidates care about issues that students
care about.''
</P>
<P>
   But which issues? These newly minted voters split along party
lines.
</P>
<P>
   Young Democrats, Shulman said, want the new president to toughen
gun-control laws, support abortion rights, and strengthen
environmental protection laws.
</P>
<P>
   Students at the College Republicans convention list education
reform, Social Security, and, as Gunning put it, ``restoring moral
leadership in the presidency.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Values and morality have plummeted with the Clinton
administration,'' Gunning said, referring to President Clinton's
affair with Monica Lewinsky, a former White House intern, which led
to his impeachment and eventual acquittal.
</P>
<P>
   But young Democrats said college students should not focus on
the Clinton sex scandal but on what his administration has
accomplished during the past 6 1/2 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton has done more for college students than what Reagan
and Bush have ever done,'' said Toby Choudhuri, 22, president of
the Massachusetts chapter of College Democrats. ``He's increased
federal grants, basically making higher education more accessible
for everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Young voters-to-be from both parties said they are concerned
about the rising cost of higher education and maintaining a healthy
job market.
</P>
<P>
   ``The immediate really concerns a lot of students,'' Choudhuri
said. ``We are facing some real high costs when it comes to
education, and students worry about how they are going to pay for
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Shulman said candidates will need to convince these first-timers
that they will be voting for someone of substance to run the
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the elections are all said and done, college voters need
to feel like they've chosen a leader, not someone with the
prettiest campaign poster,'' he said.

   LONDON _ The Cleveland Museum of Art emerged Friday as the buyer
of the most prized painting in Thursday's blockbuster sale of
Rothschild family treasures: a Frans Hals portrait of a stern-faced
Amsterdam merchant that commanded $12.8 million, a record for the
artist.
</P>
<P>
   The painting, a three-quarter-length portrait of Tieleman
Roosterman bedecked in black with white ruffled collar and cuffs,
will go on view in two weeks, museum officials said. The
transaction at least partly alleviates fears that important pieces
of the Rothschild collection, which had been displayed since World
War II in Austrian museums, would disappear into private hands.
</P>
<P>
   The sale at Christie's, which totaled $89.9 million, was one of
the most successful European auctions ever, doubling its
anticipated value and breaking 10 records for such categories as
illuminated manuscripts, furniture and carpets sold at auction. The
Roosterman portrait, one of three by Hals that were auctioned, sold
for more than four times the previous record price for the Dutch
master.
</P>
<P>
   The 218 lots were sold by members of the Austrian branch of the
Jewish banking family, who this year had the trove of Old Master
paintings, exquisite furnishings and prized historical scientific
instruments returned to them by the Austrian government 61 years
after they were seized by the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   After the war family members reached an agreement with the
government that allowed them to leave the country with many of
their possessions provided they left others behind. Many of the
holdings were displayed in Viennese museums until the culture
minister, Elisabeth Gehrer, decided last year to return them,
calling the postwar decisions immoral.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's auction packed Christie's Great Hall for hours of
frenzied bidding, but as is frequently the case, the identity of
many of the buyers is still a matter of speculation. Visibly active
in the salesroom were many members of other branches of the
Rothschild family, notably Elie and Lilliane de Rothschild of
Paris, who were sitting with Christopher Balfour, a vice chairman
of Christie's board. Mrs. Rothschild was seen vigorously bidding on
several items, buying a few scientific instruments along with a
southern German gilt-metal clock case, circa 1550, intricately
decorated with Greek myths of Orpheus and Eurydice. Mrs. Rothschild
paid $148,105 for the items, which were expected to sell for $8,200
and to $16,000.
</P>
<P>
   She also bought a gilt bronze and steel press dating from the
second half of the 16th century that Christie's experts thought
could fetch $12,000 to $16,000. Mrs. Rothschild paid $64,000.
</P>
<P>
   A member of the English branch of the Rothschild family was a
buyer, too. Jane Rick, the director of Spencer House, one of the
grandest London town houses, which was rescued from decay by Lord
Rothschild and restored under his direction, bought a Venetian
gilt-painted copper and bronze lantern, circa 1700, for $37,649.85.
That was just above its high estimate of $32,000. She was thought
to be bidding on behalf of Lord Rothschild.
</P>
<P>
   The Hals portrait of Roosterman will be reunited in Cleveland
with another portrait by the artist that the museum bought from the
Rothschilds in 1948, from the part of their collection they were
able to take with them. That work, ``Portrait of a Woman'' (whose
identity has not been established), like the one of Roosterman, was
painted around 1630.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an exceptional painting, perfect for our collection,''
said Kate M. Sellers, acting director of the Cleveland Museum of
Art.
</P>
<P>
   That the museum was determined to get the painting was evident
at Christie's on Thursday night. Clovis Whitfield, a London dealer,
who was bidding on behalf of the institution, beat out four other
bidders. The previous record for the artist was set in London in
1997 when ``St. John the Evangelist'' sold at Sotheby's for $2.9
million.
</P>
<P>
   At least one other auctioned object will remain on public view,
not in Cleveland but at Versailles. The French museum paid $10.9
million for a commode made by Jean-Henri Riesener, the finest
cabinetmaker employed by Louis XVI. The price was more than two and
a half times the estimate for the piece.

N.H. SENATOR SAID READY TO ABANDON GOP, TRY PRESIDENTIAL RUN

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senator Bob Smith of New Hampshire, a conservative
firebrand and self-styled outsider, is poised to bolt the
Republican Party and wage his quest for the presidency as a
third-party or independent candidate, sources in his campaign said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In a move certain to imperil his political career in New
Hampshire if his long-shot bid for the presidency fails, Smith is
expected to announce on the Senate floor Tuesday that he no longer
can abide what he sees as a Republican retreat from conservatism.
</P>
<P>
   Reform Party officials said Smith has inquired about the
possibility of seeking the presidency on their ticket. But sources
close to Smith said he has yet to determine if he will seek a
third-party's presidential nomination or run for the White House in
2000 as an independent.
</P>
<P>
   In either case, Smith's 22-year career in Republican politics,
which began in the obscurity of the Governor Wentworth Regional
School Board in Wolfeboro, would be over. And he would become an
instant pariah to Republican leaders. ``This is a selfish move and
is doomed to failure,'' said Steve Duprey, chairman of the New
Hampshire Republican Party. ``It signals the end of his political
career in New Hampshire.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith's decision immediately triggered speculation that his
Senate seat will be up for grabs in 2002. Notable among the
potential GOP contenders is US Representative John E. Sununu, the
son of the former governor and White House chief of staff, John H.
Sununu. The Democrat field could include the current governor,
Jeanne Shaheen.
</P>
<P>
   Smith's spokeswoman, Karen Hickey, said the senator was
vacationing in Tuftonboro and was not speaking with the news media.
</P>
<P>
   But Jim Nicholson, the Republican Party national chairman,
spared few words in his angry reaction to Smith's decision.
Nicholson warned in a letter to Smith that abandoning the GOP
``would be a serious mistake for you personally.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicholson said Smith, whose presidential campaign has attracted
scant support, even among the GOP rank-and-file in New Hampshire,
was not faltering because Republicans had fled from their
conservative principles. Instead, Nicholson blamed Smith. ``I hope
you don't confuse the success of our shared message with your own
failure as its messenger,'' Nicholson wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Smith's staunchest New Hampshire supporters also
expressed doubt about the widsom of his decision. ``I'll tell you
very frankly, I'm very disappointed,'' said New Hampshire state
Representative James E. P. Rice Jr., a Laconia Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Rice, who volunteered to work for Smith the day after he
announced his candidacy for the GOP nomination in February, said he
raised his concerns with Smith's state field director, Kevin Smith,
who informed him of the senator's decision. ``My fear is that if
his third-party candidacy gathers any real steam he could elect Al
Gore, just like Ross Perot did for Clinton,'' Rice said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been a supporter of Bob Smith's since 1980, but I think
he has just committed political suicide,'' said New Hampshire state
Representative David A. Welch, a Kingston Republican. ``He has also
let down all the people who have depended on him to carry their
issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith's standing in the Senate also could be jeopardized by his
flight from the GOP. In addition to losing his seniority rights, he
could be stripped of his chairmanship of the ethics committee. ``I
trust, if the reports are true, this issue will be discussed by the
Senate Republican Conference with Senator Smith,'' said John
Czwartacki, a spokesman for the majority leader, Trent Lott.
</P>
<P>
   In Dallas, Russell Verney, the Reform Party's executive
director, noted that Smith is among two other possible candidates
for the party's nomination: commentator Patrick J. Buchanan and
former Connecticut governor Lowell Weicker. Buchanan is currently a
candidate for the Republican nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Verney said any of the candidates could benefit from bypassing
the bruising GOP primary gantlet and tapping the Reform Party's
$12.5 million in federal matching funds. But the stakes would be
higher for Smith, Verney said, because he would risk his future in
the Senate. ``For him, it's a real career decision,'' Verney said,
``rather than a political decision.''

   ``The Paris Pilgrims''
</P>
<P>
   By Clancy Carlile
</P>
<P>
   Fiction
</P>
<P>
   Carroll &AMP; Graf, $25
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Want to know about Ernest Hemingway?
</P>
<P>
   Then don't read ``The Paris Pilgrims.'' This novel tells more
about Hemingway's possible sex life than you ever wanted to know.
Clancy Carlile's portrait of the artist as a 23-year-old man is
full of raucous details but not much else.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest problem with ``The Paris Pilgrims'' is that some of
it is fact and some is fiction, and the writer doesn't say which is
which. That's bad, because Carlile takes us into Hemingway's
bedroom _ and the bedrooms of other famous writers _ and what we
see there is graphic. It's a little like senior English class meets
``Melrose Place.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Paris Pilgrims'' unfolds in 1922, when young newspaperman
Hemingway moves to France with his boyish older wife, Hadley. They
encounter fellow art bohemians James Joyce, Gertrude Stein, Ezra
Pound, Sherwood Anderson, Pablo Picasso, Cole Porter and others.
</P>
<P>
   Every character Carlile puts on stage winds up in a compromising
position with another prominent character; only occasionally does
the narrative wander back to Hemingway and his wife. We only hope
the made-up parts are the distracting details, the irrelevant
characters and the bad dialogue, like this exchange between
Hemingway and Joyce:
</P>
<P>
   ``I read `Dubliners,' '' Hemingway announced.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ah,'' Joyce said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody's ever written better short stories. How old were you
when you wrote them?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty.''
</P>
<P>
   Hemingway seemed slightly incredulous for a moment, even
speechless. ``Twenty!'' He seemed to be counting on his fingers.
``But I thought they only came out about five years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They were turned down by 22 publishers, that's why it took so
long to bring them out.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No s---?''
</P>
<P>
   Carlile, author of ``Children of the Dust,'' is at his best when
he brings life to Hemingway: sweaty, ambitious, naive, charming,
hot-tempered, coarse, rough-around-the-edges life.
</P>
<P>
   We observe Hemingway shadowboxing on the Left Bank, cheering
bullfighters in Spain, struggling with his calling. Carlile's
Hemingway is a drunk, a brute, a party boy, a homophobe, bisexual,
a cheating husband, a jealous writer, obsessed, neglectful and
self-absorbed.
</P>
<P>
   It's often interesting, and there's something to learn from
Carlile about Hemingway and his brilliance _ but we can't really
learn much when the author leaves it so unclear as to what's fact
and what's fiction.

   BRITAIN: MAD COW BAN ENDING
</P>
<P>
   Officials expect the European Union's ban on Britain's worldwide
beef exports stemming from a 1996 outbreak of mad cow disease to be
lifted next week. The ban was imposed after the disease swept
through British cattle herds and was linked to Creutzfeldt-Jakob
Disease, which attacks the human brain. More than four million
animals have been destroyed in an effort to stamp out the disease,
which has accounted for 40 deaths.

   BRITAIN: MOVE AGAINST FOX HUNTING

<P>
   In a policy reversal aimed at placating its traditional
supporters, the Labor government will push for a bill to outlaw fox
hunting. ``It will be banned _ as soon as we possibly can,'' Prime
Minister Tony Blair said on BBC-TV. An anti-fox-hunting bill died

who made a rare public appearance in court but did not comment on
the case, is accused of conspiring to prevent a
government-appointed tribunal from investigating his personal
finances. The purpose of the 1997 tribunal, and another one still

   FRANCE: NEW BLOOD SCANDAL ACCUSATIONS
</P>
<P>
   Le Parisien published a 1989 memo to Health Minister Claude Evin
warning him that tracking down people who had received transfusions
contaminated with the AIDS virus could lead to suits against the
government. The author of the memo, Jean-Francois Girard, then a
public health official, said the document had been ``taken out of

to the mountainous area following heavy fighting a day after the
rebels gained a two-week delay in the start of peace talks. An army

<P>
   The U.N. Security Council, saying Libya had made ``significant

suspension of trade sanctions and said it would lift them
permanently once Libya complied with all its demands. Diplomats
said this meant Libya must still cooperate with the trial of two
intelligence agents accused of blowing up a Pan Am airliner over
Scotland in 1988 and agree to compensate the families of the
victims if the agents are convicted. On Wednesday Britain agreed to
reopen diplomatic relations with Libya.

<P>
   Charles ``Pete'' Conrad Jr., who flew to the Moon nearly 30
years ago and became the third man to walk upon it, died Thursday
evening after crashing his motorcycle near Ojai, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The former astronaut and Navy captain, who had survived more
than 1,100 hours of often perilous space exploration, was 69.
</P>
<P>
   Conrad was traveling from his home in Huntington Beach, south of
Los Angeles, to Monterey along with his wife Nancy and several
friends when he apparently lost control on a bend of Highway 150
several miles outside Ojai and was flung from his Harley-Davidson.
</P>
<P>
   Conrad, who was wearing a helmet and obeying the 55-mph speed
limit, did not look badly hurt, but he complained of chest pains
and difficulty breathing. Though doctors at Ojai Valley Community
Hospital worked to save him, he died more than five hours later.
</P>
<P>
   James Baroni, the deputy coroner of Ventura County, told the
Associated Press that Conrad had suffered massive internal
bleeding.
</P>
<P>
   Conrad logged 49 days, 3 hours and 37 minutes in space, a record
at the time, in the course of four missions. He not only walked on
the Moon but set what was then a space endurance record of 28 days
on the Spacelab. And his associates say he did it without ever
losing his sense of humor, or his enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks ago, Conrad flew his private plane east to the
Berkshires to be honored as an outstanding alumnus of Darrow
School, a small preparatory school in New Lebanon, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was incredibly energetic, not a man of 69 in his attitude
about life or the space industry,'' Darrow's headmaster, Laurence
R. Van Meter, recalled. ``There was nothing cynical about him at
all.''
</P>
<P>
   Conrad was born on June 2, 1930, in the affluent Main Line
suburbs of Philadelphia. His father, who served as a balloonist in
World War I, was an investment broker. Pete, as the future
astronaut was called, was more intrigued by flying and engines. As
a child, he built model airplanes. As a teen-ager, he hung around
local garages and airfields, neglecting his schoolwork. He swept up
in a machine shop to finance flying lessons, and flew solo when he
was 16.
</P>
<P>
   To buck up his academic performance, Conrad was sent to Darrow
School, where he became an excellent student, graduating with
honors in 1949. Though he weighed barely 135 pounds and stood 5
feet 6 inches tall, Pete Conrad also played center on the football
team so feistily that he was voted its captain. ``He was a very
tough boy, and we won our share of games,'' Charles Broadhead, the
school's assistant headmaster at the time, said.
</P>
<P>
   At Princeton, Conrad studied aeronautical engineering. Upon
graduation in 1953, he joined the Navy, where he became an aviator,
test pilot and flight instructor. In September 1962, he was
selected as an astronaut.
</P>
<P>
   In August 1965, he was a pilot on the Gemini 5 mission, which
circled the Earth for eight days, a record at the time. In
September 1966, he commanded the Gemini 11 mission, which set an
altitude record of 850 miles and docked with another orbiting
spacecraft.
</P>
<P>
   In November 1969, Conrad commanded the Apollo 12 mission to the
Moon, and repeated the lunar walk of Neil Armstrong and Edwin E.
``Buzz'' Aldrin Jr. Conrad spent seven hours and 45 minutes on the
Moon's surface with Alan L. Bean, setting up a nuclear generator to
power later experiments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pete squeezed the most out of every opportunity to expand our
knowledge and operating skills,'' Aldrin said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Conrad went on, in May 1973, to set a record at the time of 28
days in space as commander of Skylab 1, the first space station. He
considered that accomplishment as significant as his Moon landing.
</P>
<P>
   After one solar-power wing blew off the orbiting Skylab and the
other jammed, threatening to cut short the mission, Conrad and his
crewmate Joseph P. Kerwin crawled out of the space station and for
four hours floated on loose tethers, trying to pry the retracted
panel free with a 25-foot pole. Under such stress, Kerwin's
heartbeat hit 150 beats a minute. Conrad's heart measured a
relatively cool 100 beats.
</P>
<P>
   Conrad became as familiar to Americans for his gap-toothed grin
and puckish sense of humor as for his courage in outer space. ``If
you can't be good,'' he said, ``be colorful.''
</P>
<P>
   When Armstrong first stepped on the lunar Ocean of Tranquility
on July 20, 1969, he delivered his now-famous remark, ``That's one
small step for man, one giant leap for mankind.''
</P>
<P>
   Four months later, Conrad, the shortest man in the corps of
astronauts, made his walk on the Moon's cratered Ocean of Storms.
``Whoopee!'' he exclaimed when his foot touched the dry lunar dust.
``That may have been a small one for Neil, but that's a long one
for me.''
</P>
<P>
   When Conrad returned from Skylab I with Kerwin and Paul J. Weiz,
President Nixon presented the trio to the visiting Soviet leader
Leonid Brezhnev. The astronauts went without the face masks they
were supposed to wear to prevent them from being exposed to germs
before they acclimatized to conditions on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we catch a cold,'' Conrad told Nixon and Brezhnev, ``it
will be an honor to catch a cold from you two gentlemen.''
</P>
<P>
   After 20 years in the Navy, Conrad retired in 1973 to begin a
business career, first as vice president for operations of American
Television and Communications Corp., a cable television company
based in Denver. He moved to Douglas Aircraft Co. in 1978 as vice
president for international sales and, later, marketing. When
Douglas merged with McDonnell in 1986, he was named a vice
president of the new McDonnell-Douglas Corp., where he worked on
developing a reusable launch vehicle, called the Delta Clipper,
that NASA later turned down.
</P>
<P>
   Though Conrad appeared in a tongue-in-cheek commercial for
American Express credit cards, he was not caught up in his
celebrity. ``My name may get me through some doors,'' the Orange
County (Calif.) Register quoted him as saying. ``But I'd better
know what I'm talking about in order to stay in the room.''
</P>
<P>
   Conrad's fascination with space never waned. He started one
aerospace company, Rocket Development, to build commercial reusable
spaceships, another, Universal Space Lines, to launch them, and a
third, Universal Spacenet, to track them.
</P>
<P>
   When a letter writer asked whether there was life in space,
Conrad called it a definite possibility. ``After all, there's
plenty of unearthly looking things moving around in my
refrigerator,'' he replied, ``so there's always a chance of life
springing up almost anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   He also talked about starting a space airline. ``I predict that
people will be flying to space routinely for vacation,'' he told an
audience in Washington two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   After Sen. John Glenn, another retired astronaut, was allowed
another space flight last year, Conrad said he wanted the same
treatment from NASA when he reached the same age, 77. If the space
agency declined to loft him to the Moon again, he quipped, ``then
I'll have to do it myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Conrad's awards included the Congressional Space Medal of Honor,
two Distinguished Service Medals from NASA, two Distinguished
Service Medals from the Navy and two Distinguished Flying Crosses.
</P>
<P>
   Conrad's first marriage, to Jane DuBose, ended in divorce. He is
survived by his wife, Nancy Fortner Conrad, of Huntington Beach,
and three sons, Peter, Thomas and Andrew. A fourth son,
Christopher, died of bone cancer in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   When Conrad returned to Darrow for his 50th class reunion last
month, he wrote in its yearbook, ``I would not have gone to the
Moon if I had not gone to Darrow.''
</P>
<P>
   While at the reunion, he talked not only about his life in space
but also about a vintage motorcycle he was restoring.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was clear,'' said Van Meter, the headmaster, ``that flying
and motorcycles were, as they always had be for him, two major
loves in his life.''

KAUFMANN'S STARS TRY TO REGAIN THE HEAVENS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By JOANNE LEGOMSKY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Shareholders of the Kaufmann Fund must wax nostalgic as they
consider its recent performance and wonder if the fund's best days
are behind it.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, they remember years like 1991, when the fund returned
79 percent, outperforming its small-stock growth fund peers by 20
percentage points, on average. They remember when the stock-picking
prowess of its managers, Hans Utsch and Lawrence Auriana, was so
widely celebrated that their imprimatur could ``make'' a new issue.
</P>
<P>
   But they also remember January 1998, when the fund sold short
Amazon.com. That decision, a bet that the stock's price would
decline, cost the fund $85 million when the position was closed in
January 1999. The miscalculation was all the more unnerving because
it coincided with a slide in the fund's relative performance.
</P>
<P>
   Though investors may forgive management for underperforming the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index, since small-capitalization
stocks have lagged behind larger stocks the last few years, they
are no doubt frustrated by the fund's failure to capitalize on the
surge in small stocks in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   While the average small-cap growth fund tracked by Morningstar
Inc. gained 12.17 percent this year through June 30, the Kaufmann
Fund declined 0.53 percent. That weakness dragged down the fund's
three-year average annual return to 5.11 percent, little more than
half the 9.39 percent average for its category.
</P>
<P>
   Auriana, 54, attributes the poor showing to a drift in the
fund's investment style. In the aftermath of last summer's market
turmoil, he said, ``we got cautious.''
</P>
<P>
   As such, the fund increased its investments in health care
stocks last fall to 28 percent of the portfolio, versus an average
weighting of 13.5 percent for small-cap growth stock funds, and
pared back technology stocks to 15 percent, compared with the
average of 29 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But the health care component of the Russell 2000 small-stock
index fell 0.81 percent this year through June 30, while the
technology sector forged ahead 17.92 percent. ``We should have
stayed true to our bottom-up style'' of selecting stocks, Auriana
said.
</P>
<P>
   The other problem, in Auriana's view, was the sharp rise in
Internet stocks. Though Web stocks made up 9.3 percent of the
Russell 2000 as of June 30, as calculated by Salomon Smith Barney,
the fund owns none. But that, he said, ``we don't regret one bit.''
He added, ``We invest in profitable companies with clear business
prospects.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he acknowledged, ``shorting Internet stocks was wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   But some believe that the fund's troubles go beyond style drift
and Web-phobia. For one thing, said Michael Lipper, chairman of
Lipper Inc., the fund research firm, the small-stock universe that
Utsch, 62, and Auriana once mined so successfully is now filled
with analysts, making it tougher for them to maintain an edge.
</P>
<P>
   And some critics contend that the pair allowed the fund to grow
too large and unwieldy. Kaufmann's assets swelled from $40 million
in 1990 to a peak of $6 billion in 1997, before shrinking to a
still bulky $3.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last time Kaufmann ranked in the top 20 percent of its
category was 1994,'' said Jeff McConnell, an analyst with
Morningstar, when assets were $1.6 billion. To deploy all its
money, Kaufmann has expanded the number of companies in which it
invests and moved away from its micro-cap emphasis. The median
market capitalization of stocks in the fund has grown to $1.96
billion _ almost six times the $327.7 million in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Auriana says size has not weighed on the fund's performance.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Savage, editor of The No-Load Fund Analyst, notes that
Kaufmann's total expense ratio of 1.89 percent has cut into the
fund's returns. ``It wasn't an issue when the fund was doing
well,'' he said. The average total expense ratio for small-cap
funds tracked by Lipper Inc. is 1.418 percent. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To turn things around, Lipper thinks the fund needs to
restructure its portfolio. Management could, for example, use
losses to unlock long-term gains in some health care holdings,
freeing money for more promising areas. In his view, ``the
fundamental issue is security selection.''
</P>
<P>
   Cendant, Kaufmann's largest holding at 8 percent of assets, is a
case in which stock selection has raised questions. Not only is
Cendant a large-cap stock, but critics say that holding such a big
position in the company means that Kaufmann has missed out on other
opportunities. Last year, Cendant's shares plummeted as low as
$6.50 in the wake of an accounting scandal. But the fund bought
more shares, reducing its average cost to less than $10 a share.
Cendant has since recovered, closing Friday at $20.625.
</P>
<P>
   Auriana is comfortable with the stock, saying, ``They have
strong franchises, they generate lots of free cash flow, and the
accounting problems are behind them.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, he said, ``in effect, we've taken Lipper's advice.''
The fund recently reduced health care to 17 percent of its assets
by taking profits in long-time holdings like Steris and Cardinal
Health. And it restored technology to 27 percent by, for example,
increasing its position in Alpha Industries, a maker of integrated
cellular-phone circuits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're comfortable with how the fund is positioned now,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The portfolio consists of profitable companies that he and Utsch
believe are growing faster, and selling at cheaper price-earnings
ratios, than the S&AMP;P 500.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a history of investing in good growth companies,''
Auriana said. ``In no way have we altered our style.''

 &HT;    One-and-only Cartoon Network President Betty Cohen is the
marketing dynamo behind cable success story of the '90s
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, July 11.
 &HT;    By Jill Vejnoska
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   She's one of the most powerful women in television, equal parts
creative risk taker and savvy businesswoman in a setting where
success can be as fickle as a finger on the remote and
personalities run the gamut from Ted Turner to Bugs Bunny.
</P>
<P>
   Yet on a morning in downtown Atlanta, Betty Cohen is basically
at the mercy of a ballroom full of girls.
</P>
<P>
   First she encourages them to explore options in life. Next, to
find mentors. But it's when the Car-
</P>
<P>
   toon Network president conducts an onstage interview of a
pint-size volunteer named Allison that the predictably chatty and
easily distracted ``Take Our Daughters to Work Day'' crowd becomes,
shall we say, fully engaged.
</P>
<P>
   Allison enjoys horseback riding, playing basketball and math.
But alas, she has no idea what she might want to be someday.
</P>
<P>
   ``So she's going to need our help,'' Cohen calls out to the
crowd just before being practically knocked backward by their
shouted suggestions: a veterinarian. A scorekeeper (Cohen: ``I
think she could be a sportscaster.'') Even, egads, an agent.
</P>
<P>
   It's as if the whole room suddenly gets what Cohen had been
saying a few minutes earlier: ``It's an adventure, and your
adventure to pursue.''
</P>
<P>
   A day later, Cohen is still smiling. And why not? She's been in
those little girls' shoes, although at the moment, the wide, quiet
streets of Racine, Wis., where she grew up, seem awfully far from
the large corner office where an efficient staffer whisks in a
belated lunch. As always, Cohen is bathed in the glow of three TVs
silently broadcasting the Cartoon Network and its major
competitors, Nickelodeon and the Disney Channel. Daffy Duck and
Scooby Doo mugs decorate a shelf behind the couch. The 42-year-old
Cohen, a chestnut-haired, bespectacled dynamo (``short and
animated'' is how TV Guide described her in an irresistible _ and
accurate _ pun), settles in for a long talk under the gaze of her
truly animated office mates.
</P>
<P>
   Ed, Edd and Eddy. Cow and Chicken. Bubbles, Blossom and
Buttercup, a.k.a. ``The Powerpuff Girls.'' And Dexter, the little
mad scientist, who was the trailblazer for original animated
programming at a network that, let's face it, could have run ``Bugs
Bunny'' ad infinitum and done quite well for itself. The
characters' pictures practically leap off her office walls in
Turner Broadcasting's Techwood complex, leaving absolutely no doubt
about what Cohen does for a living.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think most people think I must get to watch cartoons all
day,'' Cohen said, midway through a typically jampacked day that
included a teleconference with Cartoon Network's Latin American
brand manager, talks with Time Warner officials from New York and a
meeting about a CNN special that would involve Turner Learning, the
educational division Cohen also heads. ``They don't understand that
it's the entertainment business.''
</P>
<P>
   As the only president the Atlanta-based Cartoon Network has ever
known, Cohen has taken one of Turner Broadcasting founder Ted
Turner's lovably loopy ideas _ a 24-hour channel devoted to
cartoons _ and in some six years turned it into a cable success
story of the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   She started with a relatively skimpy 2 million subscribers
(ironically, none in metro Atlanta, where the channel wouldn't
become available for another three years). Though still in the
shadow of Nickelodeon, longtime big kid on the kids TV block, the
Cartoon Network passed the 50 million subscriber mark in May,
making it basic cable's fastest-growing channel.
</P>
<P>
   Nick's ``Rugrats'' remains the undisputed cartoon king (most
weeks, the show is among the top 15 basic cable programs; for the
week ending June 27, it had an audience of more than 3 million).
But Cartoon Network's ``Johnny Bravo'' is beginning to flex his
comically overdeveloped muscles. A Feb. 14 episode about the
pompadoured guy who fancies himself God's gift to women was watched
in 1.3 million households, the highest ever for a single episode of
a Cartoon Network show.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps even more impressive: Adults make up 30 percent of the
Cartoon Network's audience in 145 countries.
</P>
<P>
   This, despite Cohen's unenviable task of having to build an
identity for a channel without a human star to speak on its behalf.
But those who know Co-
</P>
<P>
   hen say that task is no problem for her. Her strength, they say,
is in marketing, a skill honed at the fledgling Lifetime and TNT
networks and brought with her to the Cartoon Network.
</P>
<P>
   Making the nascent network primary sponsor of a NASCAR Winston
Cup Series car four years ago looks particularly prescient given
auto racing's popularity now. Indeed, Jeff Gordon won the recent
race in Sonoma, Calif., but it was the unveiling of ``The Jetsons''
car that really turned heads. (They've already used cartoon
characters Scooby Doo, Tom and Jerry and the girls from the
``Powerpuff'' series.) Over in England, meanwhile, Fred Flintstone
and Barney Rubble were gorging on strawberries and cream at
Wimbledon _ the latest marketing lob from ``Smash Tennis,'' a
Cartoon Network program that works with the U.S. Tennis Association
to introduce the game to kids.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder Broadcasting &AMP; Cable magazine named Cohen marketer of
the year in 1997. And industry bible Advertising Age in November
named the Cartoon Network the year's best cable TV marketer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Betty is dynamite!'' says Turner, who gave her eight months to
create the cartoon channel from scratch after elevating her from
general manager of TNT in February 1992. ``She has made the Cartoon
Network what it is today.''
</P>
<P>
   Exploring in her blood
</P>
<P>
   Not that it's all been about marketing. Among the Cartoon
Network's original series, ``Dexter's Laboratory'' and ``Cow and
Chicken'' have been nominated for four and two consecutive
prime-time Emmys, respectively. And NASA in 1997 named a rock on
Mars in honor of ``Space Ghost,'' the animated talk show ``host''
who regularly has visits from the likes of Willie Nelson, Michael
Stipe of R.E.M. and Ice-T.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dexter'' was the first original Cartoon Network series
greenlighted by Cohen, who liked its pacing and characters. But the
network doesn't reflect just Cohen's tastes: She knows what works
in the highly competitive, ever-changing cable TV industry and has
an almost Turneresque zeal for exploring what's out there.
</P>
<P>
   This, after all, is the same Betty Cohen who left Racine for
Stanford University sight unseen. She'd spent the previous summer
pedaling her Schwinn around her quiet hometown, sure of almost
nothing except that it was time for her to go. Suddenly, she found
herself seated in her new roommate's convertible, traversing the
exotic snarl of San Francisco and experiencing an unforgettable
rush of exhilaration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suddenly, there was all this choice,'' Cohen remembered. ``And
I thought, `I knew there was a reason I was supposed to be bored in
Racine!'''
</P>
<P>
   Not that she'd idled her youth away, you understand. The middle
of five children born to Philip and Pearle Cohen, Cohen always used
her mind to roam. At 6, she joined a six-week summer reading
program, after which Pearle was asked by the flabbergasted teacher,
``Do you know your daughter read 99 books?!''
</P>
<P>
   It stood to reason, then, that Cohen would edit her high
school's literary magazine. Less predictable was her singing role
as Bloody Mary in the school's production of ``South Pacific.''
Cohen had no singing experience, so the school's drama instructor
arranged free lessons.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Cohen suggests the experience taught her something more
important than how to stay on pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``He saw what interested me, and he pushed me to do more,''
Cohen said of the drama teacher, her first mentor. ``He said,
`Don't just try out for this play, don't just think of yourself in
this role.'''
</P>
<P>
   It's an attitude those around her can't help but share.
</P>
<P>
   ``My worldview has changed as a result of knowing her,'' says
Jonathan Liff, the Emory epidemiologist whom Cohen married last
year. ``It's definitely expanded.''
</P>
<P>
   Arriving on the Stanford campus, Cohen had no specific career
goal in mind, other than an interest in TV. But she seemed to have
few qualms about staring into the unknown, according to Gale Anne
Hurd, the mega-successful film producer (``Aliens,'' ``The
Terminator''), who was her freshman roommate.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I arrived at Stanford, I was completely overwhelmed _
what did I want to major in, what to do with my life,'' said Hurd,
who remains close friends with Cohen. ``Most of the people I knew
at Stanford were frantic. But I never saw her upset or overwhelmed.
Betty seemed so calm and focused.'' Some of that was probably due
to Phil Cohen's example. A life insurance salesman, his children
knew if they wanted to attend college out of state, they'd need
scholarships.
</P>
<P>
   ``Betty ... sat down with her father and he said, `Don't worry
about all four years at once. We'll take it one year at a time,'''
Pearle Cohen recalled from Highland Park, Ill., where she and Phil
now live.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, some of the former World War II pilot's spirit of
adventure had to have rubbed off on Betty when, preparing to take a
business trip to Denver, he realized all the kids hadn't yet flown
on an airplane.
</P>
<P>
   ``He walked in with seven tickets to Denver and said, `Well, I
just bought an airplane!''' said Pearle Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   Was it any wonder, then, that Betty Cohen spent her junior year
living and studying on a British estate? The ``Stanford in
Britain'' experience was more than adventure, however. There, Cohen
now says, she realized that her professional future lay in
television.
</P>
<P>
   She wrote papers (one, prophetically, was on children's
television) and watched through slightly disbelieving American eyes
as Parliament debated creating a fourth British TV channel. (``We
were like, what are you debating? Figure out what shows are going
to get ratings and make money!'') But it was seeing a BBC
documentary on adult literacy that sealed the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a story you can write about the shame of adults who
can't read,'' said Cohen. ``And then there was this documentary
that had live, human grown-ups needing people to tell them what was
on the menu. That's something very powerful that you can do (with
TV).''

   UNDATED: do (with TV).''
</P>
<P>
   Honing her skills
</P>
<P>
   After graduating Phi Beta Kappa, Cohen worked in San Francisco
for the Public Media Center, which helped political and social
causes. One day she found herself interviewing older women for a
mental health project.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept asking them individually, `Is there anything you regret
about your life,''' recalled Cohen. ``And to a person, they all
said they regretted that they didn't take more chances.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon thereafter, Cohen moved to New York to work for the Cable
Health Network. It later became Lifetime, where, as head of
promotions, Cohen had to lure viewers to shows such as ``Working
Mothers'' _ which aired in the middle of the workday _ and tone
down the high-pitched squeals of Dr. Ruth Westheimer as she read
promos off a TelePrompTer.
</P>
<P>
   At Lifetime, Cohen recognized the power of promotions and
packaging in the young cable industry, where there was almost no
original programming. That realization grew when she became
director of on-air promotions for Nickelodeon, then an
all-children's network owned by MTV.
</P>
<P>
   ``On-air promotions had to be great at MTV because, see, they
didn't have any shows. They had a bunch of commercials for records
which were called music videos,'' said Cohen. ``They were the first
network to build an identity because of their on-air promotions and
contests and their cool animated IDs. So Nickelodeon at the time
looked over at MTV and said, `Wow, you can actually attract an
audience over how you package the shows, not just with the shows
themselves.'''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen wasn't looking to leave when, in 1988, a former colleague
suggested she join him at TNT, the new Turner network. On her first
visit, Cohen came armed with a list of things Atlanta had to have
for her to consider relocating: a sushi bar, a late-night
bookstore, a hol-
</P>
<P>
   istic health store. But she also carried a healthy respect for
and curiosity about what Ted Turner was trying to do by building a
network around his recently acquired library of MGM films.
</P>
<P>
   ``It struck me as an idea whose time had come,'' said Cohen. ``I
thought a lot of people wanted quality
</P>
<P>
   in their TV and movies, but you didn't have to
</P>
<P>
   be snobby about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen returned to her Atlanta hotel room expecting to agonize
over her decision. Instead, she once again became that teenager
bicycling through Racine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just like, `No, I think I want to do this,''' remembered
Cohen. ``It was just one of the most natural, odd things.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen quickly influenced TNT, where she headed the marketing
department that established the network's ``brand'' as something
more than a collection of old movies. She also launched TNT's
original programming and its NFL and NBA packages. Turner clearly
liked what he saw. In 1992, Cohen was plucked from her general
manager's position at TNT and asked to build the Cartoon Network,
to hone a channel largely unfamiliar to cable operators,
advertisers and viewers. Not a problem for Cohen, according to one
top Turner executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We create new networks and take programming and piece it
together to create brands and the look and feel of networks,'' said
Terry McGuirk, chairman and CEO of Turner Broadcasting. ``That is a
very specific skill to be able to excel at. Betty is very good at
it.''
</P>
<P>
   In particular, McGuirk says he loves Cohen's ``passion'' for
programming on the Cartoon Network, which got its start when Turner
acquired the 8,500-cartoon Hanna-Barbera and MGM libraries. (The
subsequent Time Warner merger in 1995 brought additional cartoons
from Warner Bros. such as ``Roadrunner.'') Cohen says not having to
buy programs gave the channel time and money to develop its own
cartoons _ and to keep raising the bar creatively. In the works for
``Dexter's Laboratory'' is a millennium-themed, hourlong special.
The newest show, ``The Powerpuff Girls,'' about three spunky
5-year-olds keeping order in seemingly bucolic Townsville, has been
hailed by everyone from young viewers to Rap Pages magazine.
</P>
<P>
   An affinity for Bugs
</P>
<P>
   Like a mother who loves all her children equally but in
different ways, Cohen seems somewhat hesitant to single out a
favorite among all the world's cartoons. And yet ...
</P>
<P>
   ``I can always be talked into sitting down for `Bugs Bunny'
cartoons,'' she confides. ``He's such a wise guy.''
</P>
<P>
   As unofficial symbols go, he's not bad for a network that Cohen
says has a ``Bugs Bunny-irreverent, don't take yourself too
seriously'' attitude. And who better to run it all than Cohen, who,
after describing one of the channel's early attempts to create an
animated character, began bowing forward from the waist and
giggling: ``The next time I saw (``Flintstones'') creator Joe
Barbera, it was like that thing in `Wayne's World' where you go,
`We're not worthy!'''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it is her sense of humor _ in particular, her trademark
burbling laugh _ that comes up frequently in conversations about
Cohen. Lynn Borsuk, a Decatur lawyer who ended up introducing Cohen
to her future husband, thinks it explains her ability to get along
with nearly everyone she meets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her humor is warm, and it's silly and it's got a childlike
quality to it, where so much humor today is biting and cynical and
sarcastic,'' said Borsuk, who points out that when faulty air
conditioning forced the fire department to temporarily evacuate
Cohen and Liff's wedding reception last year, the bride was among
those laughing and making sure there were photos. (``She made it
into an adventure,'' said Hurd, another guest.) ``I think that
makes a difference in how you're able to relate to people,'' Borsuk
continued.
</P>
<P>
   And make no mistake about it, Cohen has to relate to a lot of
people, whether it's Turner himself, the head of Cartoon Network
Japan or even young reporters in the student bureaus created by
Turner Learning. There's also a personal life to tend to. Her
weekend plans with Liff aren't certain yet on this Friday afternoon
_ ``Sometimes Friday nights are (for) planning the weekend,'' she
admitted _ although Cohen was determined to deliver a gift basket
to a friend who'd just had a baby.
</P>
<P>
   Getting away from the job mentally may be just as tough.
</P>
<P>
   ``She takes a lot home with her,'' said Liff, who helps Cohen
relax via long walks, moviegoing and barbecuing. ``My job is to
listen, be supportive and when appropriate, try to help her forget
it.''
</P>
<P>
   And it's not like he hadn't been warned. When Borsuk first met
Liff at the homeless shelter where all three volunteered and wanted
to set them up, ``Betty said, `If I don't meet him in the next 72
hours, it's going to be a month.''' Even then, getting through to
her wasn't easy, says Liff, who joked at the time about dating
Cohen's secretary, since at least he could talk to her. Somehow,
though, Cohen and Liff worked it out, and they spent five hours
talking on that first dinner date.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had never done that before, spent five hours talking
nonstop,'' said Liff, who has two teenage sons from a previous
marriage. ``Her sense of humor is wide, and her interest level in
life is high.''
</P>
<P>
   With Liff, Cohen has gone back to Racine, a place for which she
retains obvious affection, and to China. The latter trip was for
business, but, Liff says, Cohen also visited an elementary school
and the children's section of a department store.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to know what childhood is like, especially in a place
like China where they don't have brothers and sisters,'' because of
population control, Cohen explained recently. Still, she doesn't
forget the folks at home. Longtime friend Jonathan Shils, an
Atlanta lawyer, says Cohen's professional stature may keep growing,
but she and Liff are still available for regular weekend movie
outings.
</P>
<P>
   ``She may be dealing with the Ted Turners and (Time Warner
Chairman) Gerald Levins of the world, but she's still Betty from
Wisconsin,'' said Shils, who was sick at home in January when Cohen
showed up with homemade kugel. ``It's just a shorthand for her
character. It's very clear when she's got you as a friend.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as it's very clear what got her here. Her ``Take Our
Daughters to Work Day'' speech done, Cohen scooted offstage to
youthful applause and a day full of meetings, presentations and
conference calls. Onstage, the moderator encouraged the girls to
write down ``ideas for Betty'' and have their parents or teachers
pass them along.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, Cohen finished chatting with McGuirk and his two
young daughters and began gradually working her way to the back of
the hotel ballroom filled with Turner Broadcasting employees.
</P>
<P>
   Just then, a young girl made her way out from the rows of seats,
snaked her way through the adults and proudly presented a piece of
paper on which she'd written something to the Cartoon Network
president.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen's brown eyes lit up. An idea for Betty. Who knew where
this might lead?
</P>

it bothers me when people talk about them in some sort of broad
category: `All cartoons are this or that.' You would never say all
movies are one thing or another. I think cartoons do connect people
with their inner child or their adolescence. And I actually think
cartoons are more honest. They're the most truthful form of
entertainment because people's fantasies or fears can get played
out. Bugs Bunny can fall from a 10-story building and crash and
spring back. It's like everyone's wish fantasy, so you can do
things that could never possibly happen, but they're really in
touch with where people's wishes are.''

AKERS SAVING ON ENERGY TO GIVE IT ALL THAT SHE'S GOT
</HEADLINE>

 By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Her father has attended every American match
in the Women's World Cup, but sometimes he is too nervous to watch.
Bob Akers could not bear to see his daughter, Michelle, take a
penalty kick against Brazil in the semifinals, so he buried his
head in his hands, she said. She didn't miss the kick, but he did.
</P>
<P>
   He is always fearful that she will be injured, and for good
reason, because Michelle adheres to the Joe Frazier school of
defense, always leading with her face. While it is the daughter who
suffers from chronic fatigue syndrome, it is the father who is
inevitably wrung out at the end.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got this hangdog look on his face,'' Michelle said,
imitating this visage of sad exhaustion. ``He's so proud of me. He
has watched me go through so much that it kills him to think I
might be disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   No one could be disappointed by the way Michelle Akers has
played in this tournament, and while some of her teammates now get
more attention, not one has been more vital to the American success
in reaching Saturday's championship match against China in the Rose
Bowl. Akers, the first great star of this team _ one who dominated
the inaugural Women's World Cup in 1991 with 10 goals _ can still
control a game in defensive midfield the way she once did at
forward. At 33, she is the oldest player on the team, and perhaps
the most indispensable.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's the best woman that's ever played the game, period,''
said Tony DiCicco, the American coach.
</P>
<P>
   Before the tournament began, DiCicco said he would take whatever
minutes Akers could provide. From day to day, she did not know what
she would be able to give. At its worst, the chronic fatigue would
leave her unable to practice, or to play more than a half, and
cause debilitating migraine headaches, low blood pressure, memory
loss, dizziness, bouts of vomiting and a consuming feeling of
torpor.
</P>
<P>
   She struggled through the World Cup opener against Denmark and
was spent afterward. Dainis Kalnins, the team's equipment manager,
said: ``She was literally crying. I've never seen her in such
pain.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Akers has played every minute of the quarterfinal
match against Germany and the semifinal against Brazil. While
others appeared sluggish playing two games in four days, with a
cross-country flight in between, Akers slept the entire way from
Washington D.C. to San Francisco on a charter flight and awakened
as perky as Kathie Lee Gifford.
</P>
<P>
   Renewed, Akers rescued the Americans' game against Brazil by
shutting down its star midfielder, Sissi, clearing a threatening
shot in the first half and punching home a penalty kick to secure a
2-0 victory. Surprisingly for someone with a fatigue disorder,
Akers seems to play stronger in the second half than the first. The
nervous excitement and frantic early pace of a game tend to sap her
energy, she said.
</P>
<P>
   At halftime, she is wrapped in icy towels to cool her down, and
she refuels by drinking coffee to raise her blood pressure and by
eating cereal, granola bars, bananas, whatever she can force down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Raising my blood pressure a couple of points can make a
difference,'' Akers said. ``For some reason, in the second half,
the game changes and I don't have to expend so much energy.''
</P>
<P>
   After each game, Akers is given an intravenous line to restore
her fluids. She carries water with her constantly to keep hydrated,
and she adheres to a special diet that avoids dairy foods, to which
she is allergic. She spends much of her time resting between games,
and she has declined to secure a shoe endorsement, not wanting the
obligation of having to make personal appearances that could
distract her or leave her tired.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so amazing what she has to go through just to get her
body ready for a game,'' Kalnins said.
</P>
<P>
   What Akers has not been able to avoid, however, with her
muscular style of play, is injuries. She has had at least a dozen
knee surgeries, so many that she has lost count. Seven minutes into
the 1995 World Cup, she was knocked out after colliding with a
Chinese player and did not return to the lineup until the
semifinals. Against Brazil last Sunday, Akers got an egg-sized lump
on her head after a first-half collision, and later she took a kick
to the face, which has embroidered her nose with a scab and a
purplish bruise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stick my head in places where it shouldn't be, but I'm not
going to change my style,'' she said. ``That's who I am and that's
the way I play.''
</P>
<P>
   She also suffered the most bizarre injury of the 1999 World Cup.
After sitting out the North Korea game in Foxboro, Mass., Akers was
high-fiving fans as she left the field when a spectator grabbed
her, causing her to fall and wrench her right shoulder. DiCicco
said he had never before heard of anyone being injured in a
high-five accident, ``but I knew if someone was going to do it, it
would be Michelle.''
</P>
<P>
   Akers said, laughing: ``My first thought was, `Now I have to go
tell my dad that I hurt my shoulder high-fiving.' Already, he can't
sleep at night, he's so stressed out. I've already put him in the
grave six times.''
</P>
<P>
   Akers keeps going down, but popping right back up, like one of
those childhood punching toys. ``She's a warrior,'' said Carla
Overbeck, the team captain. And now she is on the verge of a second
world championship Saturday, playing before 90,000 fans, the
largest crowd to watch a women's sporting event.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been remembering those times when I was rehabbing by
myself, or feeling sick and going to practice anyway, and saying to
God, `Please give me the energy to take another step in the last
five minutes,''' Akers said. ``All this has brought me to this
place. I'm overjoyed by the opportunity to experience this.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Illusion made real, re-created playhouse is its own cosmos
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, July 11.
 &HT;    By Dan Hulbert
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Movie director John Madden wanted to shoot parts of
``Shakespeare in Love'' in Shakespeare's Globe Theatre, but after a
tour of the $13.6 million playhouse, he pronounced it ``too clean''
and passed.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, not only does the Globe gleam with white lime wash
(made using Elizabethan methods), not only is it free of ale-soaked
sawdust and drumstick bones, it has a beautifully decorated stage.
Pillars are painted to look like marble, and on the royal-blue
underside of the stage roof is a heaven of golden constellations
and gods.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Madden's) view is modern _ that Elizabethans were raucous,
sexy people always making jokes,'' says artistic director Mark
Rylance. ``But there was also a love of illusion. These theaters
were people's palaces.'' In his own, perhaps mystical,
interpretation of historical evidence, Rylance ordered the stage
painting ``because (Elizabethans) believed in muses and heavenly
influence, balanced by devils and appetites below,'' he continues.
``Some scholars feel that the stage pillars are too far forward,
but I believe they were there as important symbols, polarities of
mind and heart, moon and sun. The stage is a cosmos. It was called
the Globe for a reason.''
</P>
<P>
   The hygiene and pillar issues are just two of the debates still
buzzing, like stirred-up bees, around the Globe, christened in
1997. The debates stem from the scarcity of evidence about the
original Globe in rough sketches, letters and contracts. The
reference to ``This wooden `O''' in ``Henry V'' is often mentioned
as Shakespeare's salute to the Globe, but some scholars believe
that the play was written months before the Globe's 1599 opening
and actually refers to the Curtain Theatre on the Thames' north
bank.
</P>
<P>
   Excavations of the Globe's foundations _ discovered after
construction of the new Globe began in 1991 _ confirmed that it,
too, was near-circular, apparently with 20 sides. This settled the
Great Sides Debate (18 or 20?) that raged as part of a 1990 Globe
symposium at the University of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Controversy dates back to when actor Sam Wanamaker, trying to
find the theater's original site in 1949, was outraged to find only
a plaque on the side of a brewery. As Wanamaker labored to get the
Globe built _ construction didn't begin until 1991, a few hundred
yards closer to the river than the original site _ he was honored
with the CBE (Commander of the Order of the British Empire) at
Whitehall Palace but that didn't quell skepticism and mockery of
his dream. When the partially finished Globe presented its
``workshop season'' (with the Atlanta Shakespeare Tavern and
Georgia Shakespeare Festival among the guest troupes) in 1995, two
years after Wanamaker's death, The Times of London asked, ``Has the
great American eccentric built his adoptive country a great
folly?''
</P>
<P>
   The booming box office suggests otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't an exercise in historical copying,'' says Peter
McCurdy, the construction foreman. ``We really believe the
materials add to the character of the performance. It's a way of
getting into the minds of 400 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   The theater required 1,000 oak trees, including a grove planted
in 1805 for ships of the royal navy. Some 10,000 wooden pegs hold
it together. Hair from horses and cows is used in the mortar. An
early 17th-century building in the Tower of London complex was used
as a model, since its three stories are believed to be similar in
proportion to the three audience galleries of the playhouse.
</P>
<P>
   The Bard would approve the fact that water reeds from Norfolk
are again used in the thatch, and he might not mind that fireproof
roofing is hidden beneath it. After all, it was a burning wad of
paper from a prop cannon, landing on the thatch, that brought down
the house in 1613.

 &HT;    Long view at New Birth
 &HT;    By John Blake
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bishop Eddie Lee Long walks before a full-length mirror, pauses
to gaze at his reflection and flexes his muscles.
</P>
<P>
   The pastor of the largest church in Atlanta is wearing a black
New York Yankees cap turned backward, Air Jordan tennis shoes and
baggy shorts. Long grabs two 50-pound weights in his hands and
begins to curl them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to get any bigger,'' the 46-year-old Long says
during a morning workout in a Decatur gym. ``I'm just toning.''
</P>
<P>
   Long releases the barbells with a fierce hiss of breath. As the
weights clang back into position, Long looks at his Popeye-forearms
and grins.
</P>
<P>
   ``It helps in the board meetings,'' he says. ``In the old days,
the deacons ran everything. So the pastor had to come into the
board meeting pretty buffed.''
</P>
<P>
   Long is calling the shots these days. His name alone carries
enough weight to make things happen. This former corporate salesman
has muscled his way to the top of the nation's religious landscape
by transforming Decatur's New Birth Missionary Baptist Church into
a Christian colossus.
</P>
<P>
   When Long became the church's pastor in 1987, it had 300
members. He was a novice preacher, so nervous that he often threw
up before delivering a sermon.
</P>
<P>
   Today, New Birth has 23,000 members, and Long has spoken before
the Georgia General Assembly and the U.S. Congress and has visited
with President Clinton in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eddie came at the right time, with the right message and the
right packaging,'' said the Rev. Gerald Durley, pastor of
Providence Missionary Baptist Church in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Much of New Birth's success can be tied to its broad community
involvement. The church offers programs for single women, young
men, teenagers, the homeless, prisoners, first-time offenders, drug
addicts and AIDS patients.
</P>
<P>
   But much of the church's appeal is linked to Long's openness
about his own struggles. He calls himself God's ``scarred leader,''
a man who was rejected by his father, fired from a promising job in
corporate America and divorced by his first wife.
</P>
<P>
   He even had to feed pigs once to make ends meet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like the Prodigal Son,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The extent of Long's comeback can be seen every Sunday morning
at New Birth. Just make sure to get there early. The unassuming
brick church seats 3,500 people and is located on 15 acres of land
near Wesley Chapel Road. The church hires eight police officers to
handle the tide of traffic for its three morning services. Area
residents joke that New Birth members find salvation in the church
but lose it in the parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   Despite New Birth's prominence, Long remains an outsider among
metro Atlanta's black preachers. His refusal to endorse the Nation
of Islam's Million Man March and his frequent criticism of the
traditional black church annoy many black pastors. He says of those
churches, ``They major in storefront buildings.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's like Jerry Falwell, only he's black,'' said the Rev.
Timothy McDonald, president of the Concerned Black Clergy. ``Have
you ever seen him in a march or a demonstration or even a
meeting?''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Long defies any easy categorization. That's the way he
likes it.
</P>
<P>
   Long dresses like a middle-age hip-hopper, sporting tight muscle
shirts and gold necklaces, but his politics and theology are
conservative. He's an ordained black Baptist minister but says
Jimmy Swaggart, a white charismatic pastor, led him to his greatest
religious awakening. He is neither Democrat nor Republican.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been accused of not knowing who I am,'' Long said,
chuckling.
</P>
<P>
   He started off as a great salesman. A business major who
graduated from North Carolina Central University in 1976, Long
displayed a knack for winning people over. Once, in 1977, when he
was a factory sales representative for Ford Motor Co., Long was
sent to work in rural Virginia, where car dealers didn't welcome
blacks.
</P>
<P>
   Long's opening sales pitch went like this:
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Look, let's just cut the crap. I'm black. You're
white. You can call me whatever you want, but I'm here to help you
make some money. And I need you to help me make some money.'''
</P>
<P>
   Such a bottom-line approach has helped him transform New Birth
over the past decade. Only a few years ago, Long obtained a $3
million business loan for New Birth to purchase 170 acres of land
near Atlanta's Hartsfield International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   The land turned out to be prime real estate. A year later, New
Birth sold the land for $14 million. Long used part of that money
to pay off the loan, all of New Birth's other debts and purchase
240 acres in Conyers for a new church. That $45 million complex is
scheduled to be complete by mid-2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he said we were going to buy some business, it happened,''
said Andre Landers, an associate minister. ``If he said we were
going to buy some land, we bought the land. Everything he said from
the pulpit came to pass.''
</P>
<P>
   But Long is more than a businessman. He likes people. He is
constantly hugging them, even strangers who sometimes cry in his
arms. He is a gifted storyteller and mimic.
</P>
<P>
   Long calls himself a ``spiritual daddy'' to literally hundreds
of young men in his church. An estimated 40 percent of the members
of New Birth are men, a rarity among black churches.
</P>
<P>
   He's their pastor, but also a benefactor and buddy. Long has
paid college tuition for some members, given his business suits to
others and plays basketball and lifts weights with his male
ministers. He's even taken some on business trips.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first plane ride was with the bishop,'' Landers said. ``My
first trip overseas was with the bishop. My first family vacation
was because of him. He paid for it. There are so many firsts that
he has been responsible for.'' He takes his role as spiritual daddy
at New Birth seriously, even paddling some wayward teenage boys,
brought to him by church members who trust his leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I say bend over, even on Sunday, they bend over,'' he
said. ``Why? Because they respect me. Because I first died for
them. There's nothing I wouldn't do for them.''
</P>
<P>
   He's been providing fatherly support for years. In college, he
would cook meals for kids, buy them sports equipment and take them
to baseball games. ``He's always been a giver,'' said Dennis Meeks,
a college friend.
</P>
<P>
   Long said he gives so much to kids because he lacked such
support when growing up in Charlotte. He describes himself as a
nerd whose high school counselor told him he was too dumb to go to
college. Long's friends said he was an introvert who seldom talked.
</P>
<P>
   Issues of self-esteem, however, no longer seem to be a problem.
</P>
<P>
   Long occasionally refers to himself in the third person. His
pulpit is ringed with bodyguards on Sunday morning because of death
threats. And he is treated like royalty at New Birth. When he
arrived at the church after a morning workout recently, he was
greeted by three staff members _ one to take his suit inside,
another to open his car door and another to open the church door
for him.
</P>
<P>
   When Long first arrived at New Birth, he had to answer to a
deacon and trustee board. That changed when he told the
congregation a ``biblical leader'' shouldn't have to answer to such
a board. For support, he had his friend, Bishop T.D. Jakes _ they
share the same tailor _ fly to Atlanta and give a sermon backing
his position.
</P>
<P>
   Long said his congregation now understands the true role of a
minister.
</P>
<P>
   ``A pastor is called to minister to God,'' he said. ``Then God
ministers back to him the Word, and he comes before the people to
tell them what God said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It ain't about visiting you in the hospital. It's not about
all of this other stuff we add on _ come to my house and eat
chicken, and do this and be at my beck and call.''
</P>
<P>
   `Daddy pulled back'
</P>
<P>
   Long's father, the Rev. Floyd Long, liked to be in charge. He
was a stern Baptist minister and an entrepreneur. At one point, the
elder Long not only pastored two churches but owned a gas station
and an auto body shop in Charlotte, where Eddie Long was born.
</P>
<P>
   Floyd Long was known as ``the cussing preacher,'' a tough man
who asserted himself during a period when most black men were
afraid to do so in the segregated South.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he was standing in line and all of a sudden a salesman
would take a white person in front of him, he would say, `No, this
is not going to happen,''' said Larry Long, Eddie Long's older
brother.
</P>
<P>
   ``He built many brand-new (church) buildings,'' Eddie Long said.
``But shortly after he built them, he would get mad at the deacons
and go somewhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   Floyd Long was emotionally distant from his children. He didn't
attend Eddie Long's football games or even his high school and
seminary graduations.
</P>
<P>
   ``My daddy pulled back when it came to touching you and saying,
`I love you,''' Long said. ``I needed that so badly.''
</P>
<P>
   So Long relished the love showered on him by his mother, Hattie.
She transformed his childhood home into the ``Kool-Aid'' house, a
place where all the neighborhood kids gathered to bask in her
attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``His sensitivity and caring came from his mother,'' Meeks said.
``His drive and motivation came from his dad.''
</P>
<P>
   `I embraced him'
</P>
<P>
   Long's drive carried him through college. He not only became the
president of his fraternity, Kappa Alpha Psi, but a radio
personality and a concert promoter for funk groups such as Kool &AMP;
the Gang.
</P>
<P>
   Long's foray into corporate America was rockier. He did well at
Ford initially but said he was eventually fired for including
personal phone calls on his expense report. Long ended up in a
labor pool in 1979 in Richmond, standing on a corner waiting for
work. One day he was sent to a factory that made hog slop.
</P>
<P>
   Later that year, he joined Honeywell Inc., where he remained for
eight years. In 1987 he left to answer a call to the ministry after
graduating from the Interdenominational Theological Center in
Atlanta the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   On the day he delivered his trial sermon, he met his first wife,
Debara. They had a son, but the marriage ended after three years.
Long persisted in his ministerial call, pastoring a small church in
Cedartown that grew to 400 people. Long returned to Atlanta when
the departing minister at New Birth suggested Long take his place.
</P>
<P>
   Floyd Long watched his son's progress with a mixture of envy and
respect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once he became ill, people would come and talk to him about
Eddie,'' Larry Long said. ``He would swell up with pride and say,
`God really has work for that boy.'''
</P>
<P>
   But Eddie Long didn't think his father loved him. He finally
worked up the courage to ask his father _ by this time in a
hospital after suffering a stroke _ why. ``He started crying,''
Long said. ``He apologized.'' The elder Long said he didn't know
how to love a son because his own father was so distant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt sorry for him,'' Long said. ``I could tell that he had
been locked up. I embraced him.'' Floyd Long died in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   After finding success at New Birth, Long now has found stability
in his personal life. He and his second wife, Vanessa, have three
sons, Edward, Jared and Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   He drives a black Lincoln and lives in the Hunt Valley
subdivision, an equestrian community in Lithonia where the median
price for homes is $325,000.
</P>
<P>
   In his spare time he likes to read self-help and business books,
shop at malls and people-watch.
</P>
<P>
   It's a long way from making pig slop to living in a community
surrounded by horse pastures. But Long attributes his success to
something he learned as a kid.
</P>
<P>
   One summer day, Long jumped into a pool, even though he couldn't
swim. He sank to the bottom, thrashing wildly, convinced he would
die.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, someone reached in, grabbed Long, and said, ``Stand up,
fool!'' Long stood and the water came only to his chest.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll fall sometimes, but the Bible tells us to just stand,''
Long said. ``When you stand up, that's when you'll find out that
you're not overwhelmed. I just kept getting up. You only drown when
you lay in the water and don't stand up. I've never forgotten
that.''

 &HT;    Biggs offers gifts of history
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, July 11.
 &HT;    By Lee May
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ga. _ For a long time, Alfonso Biggs, 95, has been the
keeper of his family's history. He doesn't just keep it, though; he
shares it, donating many of the artifacts to public places.
</P>
<P>
   A small ceremony is scheduled for today in Talbotton _ about 40
miles northeast of here, county seat for ``a hunter's paradise'' _
to mark Biggs' latest gift, to the Talbot County (Ga.) Library.
</P>
<P>
   The items he's passing on were created by his great-grand-
</P>
<P>
   mother, Phyllis McRosalynn Biggs, a talented craftswoman,
quilter, slave _ and mistress to the plantation owner, who left the
home's contents to her. This new display _ a history lesson in a
library _ includes crocheted table scarves, pillowcases and a quilt
top dyed with pokeberries.
</P>
<P>
   ``The importance of this display is the person who made it,''
says Evelyn Owen Rowe, vice president of the library board.
``Phyllis Biggs was imprisoned and able to rise above that and use
her talents. That shows that she was a spectacular individual with
a dauntless spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, she was a spiritual beacon for the family. Alfonso Biggs
says his great-grand-
</P>
<P>
   mother, born in 1814, was snatched from her birthplace in the
Congo by slave raiders around 1831 and forced into a hellish sea
voyage that lasted 60 days, before reaching Norfolk. After
repeatedly being sold, she wound up on the Talbot County
plantation, where she bore the slavemaster three sons and a
daughter, says Biggs, before dying in 1912 in Juniper.
</P>
<P>
   Determined to spread the word in his native county about his
great-grandmother's talent, Biggs last year offered the artifacts
to the Talbot library. ``He feels strongly that the items should be
in Talbot,'' says Rowe, ``because she was a slave there.''
</P>
<P>
   As these pieces go on display, they forge another link between
the present and the past. For Biggs and his family, like black
families nationwide, that past is, of course, a mix of proud
emotional riches and wrenching physical deprivation, wrapped in a
struggle to overcome.
</P>
<P>
   On this steamy Columbus afternoon, Biggs offers a meal and a
talk about his family's pride and pain, expressing the hope that
from his gifts of history, learning will rise. His voice is strong,
his gestures sure, mind sharp _ all of which makes you hope that
this is what 95 is supposed to be like.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forgotten black slaves' struggle for freedom did not pay off
in their time,'' he says, even though ``slaves were builders,
inventors and creators. They give a legacy of music and dance to
their new homeland. They survived under the most difficult
circumstances and developed a culture that is passed from
generation to generation.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharing his family history with generation after generation is
Biggs' legacy. In 1991, he gave to Fort Valley State University a
huge collection of period furnishings, most dating from 1860 to
1900 and some made by slaves. The pieces include silver, glassware,
china, quilts and linen _ along with dining room and bedroom
furniture from the Talbot County home where Phyllis Biggs was a
slave.
</P>
<P>
   The generation of students now seeing the Biggs exhibit at Fort
Valley State has shown great interest in it, says Linda Hall, vice
president for university advancement, because it provides a good
sense of how the upper class lived. She says the exhibit, on view
in the Anderson House Museum, ``puts us on the tourist map.''
</P>
<P>
   Back here in Columbus, Alphonso Biggs could be on a culinary
tourist map. The one-time textile worker, who has cooked in the
homes of Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt, Harry S. Truman and
Dwight D. Eisenhower, still has a delicious touch, as this meal _
baked pork chops, collards, corn pudding, candied yams, corn
muffins, banana pudding _ attests. ``I walk, and I have to eat,''
he explains between bites. ``I don't go to the doctor. I don't wear
glasses. I don't take medicine.''
</P>
<P>
   After the meal (at a large table decorated with blooming lantana
that he'd grown in his lush garden and placed in a bowl of water),
Biggs brings in a big red apple, and instead of peeling it with a
knife, he uses a mechanical apple peeler, a set of cranks, wheels
and blades that efficiently does the job as he deftly cranks the
handle.
</P>
<P>
   This machine, made by a slave boy and passed down by family
members, is, like the artifacts Biggs collected and donated, a
metaphor for the unknown and unacknowledged talents that slaves
possessed. ``Slaves were the ones who made that stuff _ in master's
blacksmith shop,'' says Biggs, matter-of-factly.
</P>
<P>
   Born Feb. 14, 1904, Biggs recalls that his aunt, Imogene Biggs,
presented the apple peeler to him in the early 1920s and told him:
``Now you have a wonderful treasure. Keep it. It's very important.
It will be a foot log across deep water. You will need a guide to
go across deep water. You will have this history. You will have
memories way after I am gone.''
</P>
<P>
   ``From that day, I started saving history,'' Biggs says, his
voice firm. ``And today, it has materialized, and, you know, I am
very proud.''
</P>
<P>
   He has given the accumulated history away as diligently as he
collected it because he's ``going to the grave'' and wants to be
able to determine its fate.
</P>
<P>
   That need is understandable, as black powerlessness, and the
perception of it, have been such an abundant and bitter harvest
from seeds of slavery and Jim Crow.
</P>
<P>
   Again, Biggs' family history is instructive.
</P>
<P>
   His parents, Ella and Otha Biggs, farmed on family land in
Talbot County, where, as one of 15 children, Alfonso picked cotton,
leaving for Columbus to work in various jobs, including cooking and
cotton mill work. Explaining how he left the farm with no regrets,
he chuckles as he recalls telling his father, who wanted him to
stay: ``I love picking cotton, but it makes my back hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   He talks of growing up at a time when ``education was
forbidden'' to black people, how learning was a surreptitious act.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest thing about all of it was that everything was
forbidden to us but work. We didn't have much time to think on what
we wanted to do in life. Now, my family could raise just about
everything we needed; we were always self-sufficient. The hardest
thing for us to get was education.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, he persevered, going to school when he could,
eventually earning the equivalent of a two-year degree from Mercer
University in Macon. And he has been recognized repeatedly for his
contributions to history. Among his cherished honors is his 1997
Governor's Award in the Humanities.
</P>
<P>
   He's proud, too, of a huge wooden sign _ ``THE BIGGS HOUSE'' _
at the entrance to his home, given to him five years ago by
appreciative students who have learned from his stories and
artifacts during his many school visits and lectures.
</P>
<P>
   On this day, as he prepares for another family honor _ the
unveiling in Talbotton of his great-grandmother's creations _ he
reflects on her history and the condition of black Americans in
general.
</P>
<P>
   Biggs loves quoting his great-grandmother's sad-strong
pronouncement: ``They stripped me of everything but my thoughts,
but one day I balled up my fists and held up both my arms. In my
left arm I held the idea of my freedom. In my right arm, I held on
to my religion, my art and my music.''
</P>
<P>
   And he is fond of an old saying that comes from elders in the
Congo: ``Look on the back of your hand. It will tell you where you
come from and who you are. Never go beyond the reach of your hand.
(Stay out of debt.) And any time you think you're a white man, it's
going to tell you you're a black one.''
</P>
<P>
   This lesson, he says, has remained in his consciousness
throughout his life. Touching his left hand with his right, he
says, with more wisdom than bitterness, ``Right today, I can look
right here and get it.''
</P>
<P>
   In sharing his family history, he's working hard to make sure
everyone else gets it, too.

 &HT;    Globe a worldly stage for Bard's works
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, July 11.
 &HT;    By Dan Hulbert
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Twilight settles over London like a cozy canopy. Along
the cobblestoned river walk on the Thames' south bank, amid the
murmuring crowd waiting to enter Shakespeare's Globe Theatre,
something's in the air. Something even beyond the anticipation of
seeing ``Julius Caesar'' on almost the same patch of ground, under
the same sky, where it premiered exactly 400 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   William Shakespeare's play baptized the original Globe. Tonight,
in the full-scale replica of that open-roofed, half-timbered,
oak-and-mortar playhouse, we may relive Sept. 21, 1599, when
``Friends, Romans, countrymen ... !'' first rang out in the
afternoon air.
</P>
<P>
   Of the view from the river walk, the Bard would recognize only
the playhouse. Modern buildings loom so close that the theater
seems a bit overwhelmed, like a chunky schoolboy wearing a quaint
brown-and-white costume in a dark, crowded pub. Construction cranes
are visible _ in this long-slumbering industrial quarter of
Southwark, the new Globe has sparked new life.
</P>
<P>
   The strains of a brass consort summon the crowd into the
theater. Most reach their seats by crossing the ``pit,'' the arena
of hard-packed earth below the stage (where ``groundlings'' can
stand and see the play for $8.50, the equivalent of the Elizabethan
penny). The foot traffic, the open air, the toting of food and
drink (ale in 16-ounce tall boys _ an amusing Americanism to
British ears) create what artistic director Mark Rylance rightly
calls ``a fairlike atmosphere.'' Patrons exclaim in wonder at the
unexpectedly beautiful painting of the stage area, so different
from theunfinished lumber of the three audience galleries that look
straight down on the stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great to see so many young faces,'' says Atlantan J.
Brien Key, a professor of history emeritus at Oglethorpe
University, gesturing at the festive, backpack-wearing pit crowd.
``It bodes well.''
</P>
<P>
   Twilight lingers at this latitude; the play begins in natural
light. Only a smokestack peeking over the thatched roof breaks the
illusion of a blue Elizabethan sky.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hence, home, you idle creatures!'' Brutus' officer shouts at
the groundlings. Bingo. We patrons are the citizens of Rome. A
character points to the ``trembling Tiber'' and the Thames becomes
that stream. When Caesar's party enters in a mixture of Roman,
Elizabethan and contemporary costume ...
</P>
<P>
   ``Beware the ides of March.''
</P>
<P>
   The famous words come from the pit. Surprised backpackers turn
to see, in their midst, a small figure in a toga, made visible by
the white hair fringing his pate. Suddenly, the theater is still,
actors and audience merged in a constituency of wonder, much more
intimately than one would think possible in a theater that fits
about 1,500 spectators. The Soothsayer repeats his haunting advice.
Caesar's henchmen hoist him onstage like a doll _ drawing a laugh _
then silence settles again as the emperor confronts the seer of his
fate.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, there's something in the air. The Bard's spirit. You may
scoff at the idea of friendly ghosts, but see his play in his
house, and you too will believe. You may even wonder: Why did we
ever stop building theaters this way?
</P>
<P>
   The Buddha connection
</P>
<P>
   If this sounds like a metaphysical, even supernatural, response,
that would appear to be one of director Rylance's goals. Listening
to him earlier _ in an interview in his office, with a splendid
vista of the Thames and St. Paul's Cathedral _ one could understand
why Matt Wolf, London correspondent for Variety, calls the
39-year-old Rylance ``a bit of a mystic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Shakespeare was so masterly _ like Buddha or Christ or some
great philosopher, so that one needs to listen very hard and repeat
his lines till their layers of meaning emerge,'' says Rylance, a
slender man with a shy, boyishly sincere way about him (qualities
that should be helpful when he plays the female half of ``Antony
and Cleopatra,'' opening July 24).
</P>
<P>
   ``This place (the Globe) has changed me,'' he continues. ``A lot
of what I did (before launching the Globe's performance program in
1997) looks like vanity to me now. When you enter Shakespeare's
space, you begin to doubt if you can `interpret' him. The audience
should interpret. The director must simply bring the words to life,
while bearing in mind: `What does this say to us now?' I use little
scenery, so that your imagination is free to paint an ideal
production, just as when you're reading the folio.''
</P>
<P>
   This approach _ at least from the evidence of ``Caesar,'' with a
mixture of mellifluous thespian types and regular, unactorish
blokes _ has a populist vigor reminiscent of the late Joseph Papp
and his New York Shakespeare Festival. That makes sense, because
Rylance spent half his life in America. Perhaps the Globe's board
considered this a useful qualification for artistic director, since
the theater was built through the vision and drive of Sam
Wanamaker, the Chicago-bred actor-producer (who died in 1993,
before seeing it completed) and already draws a healthy portion of
its audience from the States.
</P>
<P>
   Born in England, Rylance moved to Connecticut as a toddler with
his mother and private-school teacher father, and later made his
professional debut as Puck in a Wisconsin summer festival. When he
returned to England in his early 20s, Rylance formed an acting
troupe and attracted critical praise with experimental productions;
for instance, mounting ``The Tempest'' at sites sacred to various
religions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't let the soft-spoken style fool you _ Rylance is no
shrinking violet,'' Wolf says. ``In fact, some thought he was a
pretentious renegade for the job. Originally the fear was that the
Globe would be some kitschy theme park. But Mark's honored the
space, taken the work seriously, with a personal vision that
addresses scholars, tourists and critics.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolf is borne out by box office success: Most of the
May-September repertory is sold out. (Indeed, the overall programs
of the International Shakespeare Globe Center, including
educational events and tours of the facility, draw 600,000 visitors
a year). Yet not all pundits agree on the art. Michael Billington
of The Guardian, dean of London critics, used his ``Caesar'' pan to
expose ``snickering American jocks'' in the pit and to further
opine, ``Caught halfway between academic exercise and tourist
totem, Shakespeare's Globe should urgently rethink its future.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, in a city that features such distinguished bardic
directors as Trevor Nunn, Peter Hall and Deborah Warner, Rylance
must clear a very high bar if he hopes to get raves.
</P>
<P>
   In a fax from his London home, Billington added, ``I hate all
that spurious `authenticity!'''
</P>
<P>
   Never say `authentic'
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps because that word had already caused similar responses,
Rylance is touchy about the word ``authentic'' and tries not to use
it at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's possible to have a truly `authentic'
theater or performance,'' Rylance says, although he takes great
pride in the fact that the Globe uses only natural sound, no
amplification, and costumes and set pieces are generally handmade
as much as possible by Elizabethan methods.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, ``The Comedy of Errors'' (which won Billington's
approval soon after the ``Caesar'' review) was played mostly in
modern dress. Rylance argues that since Elizabethan dress was
contemporary for Shakespeare's audience, ``We keep the same spirit
when our men of Rome jump up from the pit dressed (in such garb as
nylon windbreakers and backward baseball caps). Then as now, these
familiar costumes are an imaginative bridge to the audience's
world.''
</P>
<P>
   Rylance's Elizabethan-style use of men in women's roles was not
a major factor in ``Caesar'' (the most male of the Bard's plays),
but it will stand under a hot, bright spotlight when Rylance
himself (an acclaimed actor) plays Cleopatra.
</P>
<P>
   As to how he'll play her, he was appropriately coy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have a profound understanding of women,'' says
Rylance, whose wife is on the Globe staff, ``but there is some male
and female in all of us. I do know what it is to love someone and
to fear you'll lose them. I know what it is to be an outsider. I
know what it is be perceived as a kind of whore. Shakespeare has
done the imagining for me. If I play the human being, the woman
will follow.''
</P>
<P>
   Spoken by a true mystic, perhaps?

 &HT;    `Old soul' Monica in tune with herself, her audience
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, July 11.
 &HT;    By Sonia Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Monica is the teen on Nickelodeon's upcoming kids' tour who's
never really been a child.
</P>
<P>
   At least not in the public eye.
</P>
<P>
   She was introduced to us as ``Miss Thang,'' which can mean
different things to different people.
</P>
<P>
   To Monica's family, the title of her 1995 debut CD was an
appropriate way to sum up the 14-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Monica was little, she would sit at the table while
Melinda (her older cousin) was struggling to do a math problem or
something,'' recalls Marilyn Best, the singer's mother. ``And she'd
say, `Oh, Melinda, that is so easy. I can't believe you don't think
you're going to get an `A' on that. That's so simple!'
</P>
<P>
   ``So we'd say, `OK, Miss Thang, you do it.' She was always `Miss
Thang' to us. It was an innocent little name.''
</P>
<P>
   But to some people, ``Miss Thang'' is an insult _ something
mothers didn't want their daughters called because it inferred they
were too grown up for their own good.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I did my first video (for `Don't Take It Personal'), I
had my hand on my hip, neck rolling, showing attitude, and that
didn't help,'' Monica says. ``I wasn't about bubble gum songs and
smiles, like you would expect someone my age to be doing. I was me.
I was singing about pain or things that were upsetting to me or
things that I deal with, and it made it hard for people to accept
me in the beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   Notice that qualification: ``In the beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, she knows, is an entirely different matter.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the 18-year-old is one of People magazine's ``50 Most
Beautiful People.'' Chanel is flying her overseas to dress her. And
Vogue magazine just named her one of the most fashionable
entertainers.
</P>
<P>
   This particular evening not included.
</P>
<P>
   Monica is dressed in a red Nike short suit, proper attire for
what will be about a six-hour-plus rehearsal starting at 10 p.m. in
a studio on the outskirts of Buckhead.
</P>
<P>
   It's the first night Monica has rehearsed with her castle
backdrop in place, which she uses during what USA Today calls her
``highly engaging set'' in Nickelodeon's All That Music &AMP; More
Festival, which comes to Atlanta on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The moves her choreographer Devyne is having her go through over
and over and over again will surely translate to the Nick crowd,
and even to the Lilith Fair audience for whom she will perform this
summer (that tour visits Lakewood Amphitheatre on July 23-24).
</P>
<P>
   ``And what does that say?'' asks R&AMP;B's multi-Grammy-nominated
Me'Shell Ndegeocello, who's on her second Lilith tour. ``What other
teen singer, teen act, out here can give the kids what they want on
one tour, turn around and fit right into a tour with the Pretenders
and Sarah McLachlan? My girl ain't your average Backstreet Boy, you
know?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really appreciative of the reception I'm getting,'' says
Monica, who's signed with the modeling agency that represents Naomi
Campbell and Kate Moss. ``People are finally starting to become
comfortable with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Monica's music has never been a problem.
</P>
<P>
   Well, there were those persistent questions about whether
``Don't Take It Personal (Just One of Dem Days)'' was about her
menstrual cycle. But audiences took to it, and enough people bought
it to make it a No. 1 R&AMP;B single. That made her the youngest artist
ever to have a top single on that Billboard chart.
</P>
<P>
   The slower and much easier to decipher ``Before You Walk Out of
My Life'' also hit No. 1 R&AMP;B, becoming the first of her 5
million-selling singles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Monica doesn't just sing songs, it's like she's sharing the
stories of her life,'' remarks longtime R&AMP;B vocalist Chaka Khan.
``And from a musical standpoint, you can appreciate her being able
to deliver that vocally. But when you stop and think this is a
teenager doing this, it's scary.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's how she's always been,'' says family friend Emma Dudley,
who met Monica some 12 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Monica had been going to choir rehearsals with her mother since
she was 2 years old. ``And when she was 7, she was doing (gospel
standards) `Precious Lord' and `Amazing Grace' like she was as old
as we were,'' says Dudley.
</P>
<P>
   ``Monica was never the kind of child who would butt into an
adult's conversation, or talk back to grown people,'' adds Best, in
the living room of the modest, split-level College Park home her
only daughter lived in from birth until last winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``She always listened,'' her mother continues. ``She wouldn't
always do what I say. But she'd listen quietly. And then not do
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Monica has been grown since producer Dallas Austin met her when
she was 12, he says. ``She just had this presence, this `old soul'
as people say. And in addition to her voice, that's what I thought
made her special.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course I was, like, `I want to be me,''' Monica adds.
</P>
<P>
   So together they came into the industry wielding almost a
complete opposite of the smiling, single-moniker teen R&AMP;B singer of
that time, Brandy.
</P>
<P>
   Brandy's debut single was about building a relationship with
someone, while Monica's ``Don't Take It Personal'' was about taking
a break from one.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were different people coming from different directions, and
the rumors about us not liking each other started instantly,''
Brandy says with a slight laugh. ``And we hadn't even met. I'm
still answering questions about fights we never had and things I
didn't say.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing is,'' continues Monica, ``people don't get that
we're not a group. We came together to do (the 1999 Grammy
Award-winning single) `The Boy Is Mine' because we wanted to. Not
because we had to. But people still want to ask me something about
Brandy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess when they stop asking me about that, I will have
really made a breakthrough,'' she says with an expected giggle.
``But if it never happens, I'll be all right. I'll keep going.''
</P>
<P>
   She'll have to at this particular moment. Dinner break is over,
and the pizza is long gone. Time to take her place in front of the
castle again.
</P>
<P>
   Melinda, whom Monica gave such a hard time about math, is now
her manager. She's sitting at the opposite end of the sofa where
choreographer Devyne is playfully directing again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Give those kids drama, girl!''
</P>
<P>
   Monica looks back, one eyebrow raised above the black sunglasses
she wears.
</P>
<P>
   Devyne knows better, the glance seems to reply.
</P>
<P>
   Monica will always give audiences Monica.
</P>
<P>
   And if they like it, fine.

 &HT;    Spam for all: `Monty' celebrating 30 years
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   And now for something completely familiar. Reruns.
</P>
<P>
   You say you'd rather eat a pound of Spam than watch more reruns
this summer? Ah, but these are the original episodes of ``Monty
Python's Flying Circus,'' possibly the most inventive series in the
history of TV.
</P>
<P>
   Coming up to 30 years ago _ Oct. 5, 1969 _ five very silly
Englishmen and one Yank debuted on Auntie Beeb, as the Brits called
their once-staid BBC. Over four seasons, they produced 45 half-hour
shows filled with cheese shops that didn't sell cheese,
cross-dressing lumberjacks, silly walks, dead parrots, twisted
animation segues, drunken philosophers, naughty bits, exploding
candy and tattooed bishops. They were surreal, they were rude, they
were sometimes so far out they just sailed right off the edge of
the comedy map.
</P>
<P>
   To celebrate the 30th anniversary of ``Python,'' A&AMP;E is airing
the shows, in order, two to an hour. It's the first time in years
they've been shown nationally, although they've popped up from time
to time on local PBS stations, including Georgia Public Television.
</P>
<P>
   And for those who just want to wallow in way too much of a good
thing, there are two new books: the oral history ``Monty Python
Speaks!'' (Spike Books, $13.50) and Robert Ross' ``The Monty Python
Encyclopedia'' (TV Books, $22).
</P>
<P>
   First, let's settle all the nonsense about the name, which is
just that _ nonsense. There is no one named Monty Python; at an
early stage, it was almost ``Gwen Dibley's Flying Circus, or ``The
Toad Elevating Moment.'' The boys _ and they were little more than
that, fresh out of college and frustrating comedy writing jobs,
just wanted something completely different.
</P>
<P>
   Writing and performing the skits were John Cleese, Eric Idle,
Michael Palin, Terry Jones and Graham Chapman. Even then, Cleese
was first among equals, and he and Chapman (a troubled alcoholic
who died in 1989) wrote many of the classic bits, usually about
some poor beleaguered guy who goes into an office expecting one
thing and getting something else entirely. Palin and Jones' skits
usually were set in Iceland and involved Vikings or such, and Idle,
who wrote by himself, was known for his character who just rattled
on and on. The sixth Python was Terry Gilliam, an American who did
the animated bits, and went on to a mixed but interesting career as
a movie director (``The Fisher King'').
</P>
<P>
   In its own way, ``Python'' was as revolutionary as ``The
Prisoner,'' Patrick McGoohan's Kafka-esque secret-agent show that
had debuted the year before. It was huge among young people in
Great Britain, and when it finally crossed over to the United
States in 1974, about the time it was ending in England, it was
just as huge over here, at least among young people who bought into
the surreal anarchy.
</P>
<P>
   And young people keep on getting it. Somewhere, there's always
someone _ frequently, but not always, a high-school boy _
discovering ``Python'' and spreading it to his friends, and another
cafeteria lunch table rings with memorized bits: ``I wish to return
this parrot.''
</P>
<P>
   What's surprising about ``Python'' is how little influence it
had. It greatly influenced the first season of ``Saturday Night
Live,'' but then the American show mutated as it became popular and
settled into a more predictable presentation.
</P>
<P>
   But there is one ``Python''' legacy. The Pythons once did a skit
about a husband and wife ordering food in a diner, and all the
waitress has on the menu is ``Spam, Spam, Spam, Spam and Spam.''
Years later, pioneers of the Internet noticed the rise of junk
e-mail and in one of those leaps of perfect illogic, the Pythons'
old TV skit became permanently attached to the new technology of
junk e-mail. How absurd. How random. How ``Python.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Monty Python's Flying Circus''
</P>
<P>
   11 p.m. Saturdays on A&AMP;E.

 &HT;    Finding opera's inspiration between classical, country
 &HT;    By Judith Green
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I'm kind of a wannabe songwriter,'' says Michael Ching,
general director of Opera Memphis and composer of operas.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to write songs, what better role model than a
Nashville stalwart? So Ching's partner for ``Out of the Rain'' _
the centerpiece of Georgia State's Harrower Summer Opera Workshop
this weekend _ is Hugh Moffatt, who has supplied songs for Dolly
Parton, Alabama, Kathy Mattea and Ronnie Milsap. He clicked with
Parton on ``Old Flames Can't Hold a Candle to You.''
</P>
<P>
   Not unlike country music, opera deals with raw feelings: pain
and loss, love and desire, rage and revenge. Could be that's why
Moffatt felt comfortable writing the libretto for ``Out of the
Rain,'' a work about the aftermath of AIDS as discovered by a group
of high school friends at the memorial service for one of their
crowd.
</P>
<P>
   It's Ching and Moffatt's second collaboration but isn't destined
to be the last. ``It's not exactly a sequel but the second in a
series,'' says Ching, 41. Their ``King of the Clouds'' (1993) was
about a single mother and her son confronting such matters as guns
and alcoholism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Social issues are never context-free,'' says Ching, which
helps the opera team provide a layer of grit to what might
otherwise be regarded as sentimentalized social work. Both these
pieces, and those to follow, are aimed at high school audiences.
</P>
<P>
   Ching is all-Asian by ethnic background, all-American by
interests. Three-fourths Chinese and one-fourth Japanese, he says
he would have been named Motoyama if not for World War II, when his
half-Japanese, half-Chinese father, a resident of Hawaii, felt it
prudent to emphasize the Chinese part of his background because of
anti-Japanese sentiment after Pearl Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   At an early age, Ching decided he wanted to be a composer. He
has written ``a modest amount'' of orchestral pieces, including
``The Gathering,'' which introduces the instruments of the symphony
and has been performed by the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra under
former associate conductor Darryl One.
</P>
<P>
   But with mentors such as Robert Ward (``The Crucible''), his
teacher at Duke University, and Carlisle Floyd (``Susannah''), with
whom he worked at Houston Grand Opera, it was no wonder opera
beckoned.
</P>
<P>
   Ching worked his way up the job ladder at Miami Opera (now
Florida Grand Opera), Virginia Opera in Norfolk, Triangle Opera
Theater in Raleigh-Durham and eventually Memphis, progressing from
rehearsal pianist to artistic director.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fell in love with it by doing it,'' Ching says of his
growing credits in opera.
</P>
<P>
   He's written half a dozen, of which the most performed is
``Buoso's Ghost,'' a sequel to Puccini's comic opera ``Gianni
Schicchi.'' Among the others is ``Faith,'' based on a story by
James Patrick Kelly, a Hugo Award-winning writer of science fiction
(``Think Like a Dinosaur,'' 1995). These have been performed by
regional companies across the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Except for `Buoso,' it's mostly American subject matter,''
Ching says. ``I'd describe my style as very American, on the border
between classical music and music theater: Gershwin, Sondheim and
Bernstein rather than Elliott Carter or Milton Babbitt. And I do
like country music.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Out of
</P>
<P>
   the Rain''
</P>
<P>
   One-act opera by Michael Ching and Hugh Moffatt. Plus scenes
from ``Carmen,'' ``Figaro,'' other operas. 7:30 tonight and 3 p.m.
Sunday; opera scenes only, 7:30 p.m. Saturday. $10; $5 students.

BARAK'S QUEST STARTS WITH BOOST BY EGYPT 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By DOUGLAS JEHL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALEXANDRIA, Egypt _ The new prime minister of Israel promised
Friday to ``turn every stone'' in the quest for a broader Middle
East peace. But he cautioned that it would be a few weeks before he
would be ready to make his first moves.
</P>
<P>
   In the first of a planned series of meetings with Arab leaders,
Prime Minister Ehud Barak won a powerful endorsement from President
Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, who praised Barak as a friend and a ``man
of his word.'' It would only be fair, Mubarak said, to allow Barak
some time to ``reshape the situation'' after three years of tense
Arab-Israeli relations.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting, at Ras el Tine Palace on the Mediterranean coast,
was suffused with an easy joviality that would have been
unimaginable under Barak's predecessor, Benjamin Netanyahu, whose
relations with Arab leaders were tinged with mistrust.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an opportunity, and we have to exploit it,'' Mubarak
said in hailing a ``new momentum to the peace process'' after
Barak's election. The Israeli leader, who took office this week,
said he was determined to follow in the footsteps of his mentor,
Yitzhak Rabin, in trying to cap a career of military service with a
legacy of regional peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``If peace can be achieved in the Middle East, we will achieve
it,'' Barak said at a joint news conference after hours of meetings
with Mubarak Friday morning at the presidential palace.
</P>
<P>
   Their remarks were short on specifics, most notably on whether
Barak might be ready soon to carry out the Wye River agreement,
which, among other items, has Israel handing over an additional 10
percent of the West Bank to Palestinian control. Netanyahu accused
the Palestinians of having failed to hold up their side of the
bargain by not cracking down on terrorism. But Egypt has urged
Barak to proceed with the handover as a sign of good will.
</P>
<P>
   Barak did seem to offer a broad hint that a further troop
withdrawal might be forthcoming. ``Basically, Israel abides by its
international agreements, and we will address them as we learn them
one by one,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting set off a flurry of sessions scheduled by Barak to
demonstrate his commitment to peace. He is scheduled to meet with
Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader, on Sunday, at Eretz Crossing
between Israel and Gaza and to travel on Tuesday to Jordan to meet
King Abdullah before heading to the United States and a meeting
with President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Although Barak was not specific Friday about his plans beyond
that, the rough timetable suggested that he hoped to begin to
translate his peace pledges into action as early as the end of the
month.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Barak has signaled a particular eagerness to restart talks with
Syria, whose relations with Israel remained severed throughout
Netanyahu's tenure but which Barak has suggested could be restored
in 18 months. Those hints have unnerved some Arab commentators, who
worry that an Israeli focus on Syria might mean the neglect of the
Palestinians. Their deep disputes with Israel over land, refugees
and the future of Jerusalem remain the major obstacles to any final
Arab-Israeli settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Barak said Friday that he recognized that the quest for a
broader peace in the region should now have ``two and a half
tracks,'' a reference to parallel Israeli discussions with the
Palestinians and with Syria and with Lebanon, which Syria
dominates. ``We are determined to turn every stone in order to go
forward without jeopardizing our security and our interests,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, 57, and Mubarak, 71, are career soldiers, and their
mutual admiration was as evident in their appearance in an ornate
ballroom of the 19th-century palace as was their similar military
bearing. The two have worked together in the past, when Barak, as
chief of the Israeli military staff, was a negotiator on Rabin's
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``One difference is that I know Mr. Barak, but I didn't know
Netanyahu,'' Mubarak said when asked to compare the meeting Friday
with one in July 1996, when Netanyahu made a foray to Egypt not
long after taking office.
</P>
<P>
   With the Camp David accords of 1979, Egypt became the first Arab
country to make peace with Israel, and it has been the most active
in trying to broker a broader settlement. Barak said he had chosen
Egypt as the first stop on his tour in recognition of that status.
</P>
<P>
   Still, as long as other Arab-Israeli disputes continue to boil,
many Egyptians oppose further warming of ties. This week, a
conference in Cairo that attracted many advocates of closer ties
prompted a counterdemonstration by opposition politicians and union
leaders who burned American and Israeli flags.
</P>
<P>
   Although Mubarak showed great warmth toward Barak, his
government has deflected hints from Barak's aides that it might be
time for Cairo to make a more tangible show of good will.
</P>
<P>
   According to Egyptian and Israeli officials, former prime
minister Shimon Peres, now in Barak's Cabinet, made several
requests this week of Egyptian officials, including that they move
to revive a regional economic conference that has been moribund
since 1997. But Egyptian officials said Peres had been told that
any such gesture would be premature until real progress toward
peace could be gauged.

SPORTS COLUMN: WORLD CUP FINAL HAS CHINESE HERITAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also SOC-WCUP-WOMEN, SOC-WCUP-AKERS) 
(rk) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Ever since the American organizers took out
their indelible-ink pens and plotted the inexorable march from sea
to shining sea, there were chauvinistic and realistic expectations
that the Yanks would win this 1999 Women's World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Hardly anybody could have predicted the sudden hysteria for this
appealing bunch of Johnettes and Paulettes and Georgettes and
Ringoettes, but there surely was the assumption that the
combination of home cooking and summer weather and loyal home
crowds would make a difference.
</P>
<P>
   Now there is reason to think the Chinese could spurt right past
the Americans Saturday afternoon in the Rose Bowl. Then, given
America's fascination with winning, what happens to all the brave
talk about marketing these charismatic athletes?
</P>
<P>
   Still, if the Chinese should win Saturday, they would merely be
recapturing command of an event they initiated.
</P>
<P>
   That's true. Like many of the items you bring back from the
mall, the Women's World Cup carries a label that says, ``Made in
China.''
</P>
<P>
   If there had not been 65,000 fans in the stadium in Guangzhou on
Nov. 30, 1991, there very likely would not be 90,000 fans in the
Rose Bowl Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese also invented pasta, even though captain Carla
Overbeck and her chef-husband, Greg, had to slip packages of pasta
(``and spices, and I carried a wheel of Parmesan cheese,'' Overbeck
recalled) with her gear back in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The American women were really pioneers back then, catching up
on a sport that was played mainly by northern European women.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honestly, we had no idea,'' Overbeck recalled this week, on a
practice field surrounded by squealing fans, and protected by a
squad of motorcycle police.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had never been to a big tournament, and it wasn't even
called a World Cup,'' Overbeck added.
</P>
<P>
   Overbeck and her husband were not sure what the diet would be
like in Guangzhou, so they carried packaged foodstuff with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wouldn't let Greg cook,'' Overbeck recalled, ``so he had
to draw diagrams and point how he wanted it done. But toward the
end, they let him cook.''
</P>
<P>
   The women were glad to have a taste of home. (In this strange
hybrid land of America, Italian cuisine is home cooking.) But they
had no complaints about the ambiance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We stayed at the White Swan Hotel, a five-star hotel,''
recalled Joy Fawcett. ``We brought peanut butter, and we got by,
just as I'm sure they're getting by over here.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember it was the first time we had ever seen outdoor food
markets,'' said Michelle Akers. ``Some of the food choices were
pretty unusual. Sure, I tasted them, after taking a picture of them
first.''
</P>
<P>
   The women had enjoyed modest crowds and celebrity in college,
but 1991 was their first experience in an international tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to convince my dad to come over,'' recalled Julie Foudy.
``He came to our hotel, and there were huge banners and flower
displays, and he said, `I can't believe the magnitude of this.' It
was unfortunate the Chinese lost in the quarterfinals, but it was a
great tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   The Americans beat Norway in the finals in front of that huge
crowd of 65,000, at that point believed to be the largest ever to
see a women's sporting event in history. The Swedish organizers in
1995 had much more modest scale _ the U.S. lost in the semifinals
to Norway in front of little more than 2,000 fans _ and now the
U.S. organizers have exceeded their own grandiose dreams.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was great to see 65,000 in China,'' said Lauren Gregg, the
assistant coach of the American team, ``but most of them were
factory workers who were let off from work.''
</P>
<P>
   Now there is the matter of the 1999 final. The Chinese were
stung by their early loss in 1991 in front of their fans, but they
just did not have the sophisticated techniques. Today, they do.
They destroyed Norway 5-0, in the semifinal last Saturday. Their
passing is superb, their attack aggressive, their defense
coordinated, and their goalkeeping confident.
</P>
<P>
   In a country where most eyes were glazing over at talk of
women's soccer only a few weeks ago, there is a touch of midsummer
madness for this event. But would one loss to China turn the entire
experience into a pet rock or a hula hoop?
</P>
<P>
   Up to now, the greatest long-standing U.S. women's team was a
volleyball team, led by willowy and talented Flo Hyman, that lived
in makeshift training camps and made grueling international swings
to prepare for the 1984 Summer Games in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, I might have predicted that women's volleyball,
with its emphasis on grace and teamwork, would become the most
popular American women's team sport. But the Americans lost the
gold-medal match to _ ah, but you guessed it _ China. And whatever
happened to women's volleyball?
</P>
<P>
   Women's soccer is not going away. Some young women in the crowd
with their ``Hamm'' and ``Scurry'' shirts are going to be playing
for the U.S. in the next century. They will be competing with the
heirs to Gao and Sun in a sport that already owes a great debt to
China.

YES, IT'S DIFFICULT TO IMPROVE ON PERFECTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sun., July 11) 
(jt) 
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Wall Street is a natural habitat for bulls and bears.
But it is a precarious place for pigs.
</P>
<P>
   After a strikingly strong first half, stock investors might be
well advised to remember that in the final six months of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   According to Birinyi &AMP; Associates, the gain in the Dow Jones
industrial average from January through June was its sixth-best
ever. The Nasdaq market also registered its sixth-best first half.
By comparison, the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index was a real
stick in the mud: its six-month gain was merely the 12th best in
its history.
</P>
<P>
   Six months ago, Edward M. Kerschner, chairman of the investment
policy committee at Paine Webber Inc., was pretty optimistic about
1999, compared with many strategists But the gains recorded thus
far have made him cautious about the future. Last week, he took
some time to talk about how the stock and bond markets are likely
to move in the last six months of the year. Here are some excerpts:
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Before we look ahead, let's look back. What has been the
biggest surprise over the past six months? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The biggest positive surprise to the market was how good
corporate earnings have been.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the fall meltdown, at the beginning of the year 4 of
the 10 major Wall Street firms were forecasting a decline in
earnings for the year.
</P>
<P>
   That view was based on a double-barreled fallacy: first, that a
market correction means a recession, and that a recession means a
decline in earnings.
</P>
<P>
   We didn't see a recession, and after we did the math, thought
that earnings would be up about 10 percent this year. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Still, early this year people were buying stocks because
interest rates were low. And the rise, or backup, in bond yields
came as a surprise. Has it surprised you? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. We have been bullish on interest rates since 1988, but the
rise in rates we have had so far this year is more than we thought.
But there is no reason for bond yields to back up much more from
here. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Why don't you expect much higher bond yields? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. In our view, for the foreseeable future the inflation outlook
is nil. Prices are falling due to technological innovation. That
doesn't mean the Fed will start to ease again, but anyone who
thinks they will be aggressively tight is mistaken. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Still, many people are worried that rising rates will hammer
a stock market that is seen as highly overvalued. What potential do
you see for a substantial correction?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. In terms of valuation, in every sense we can quantify the
stock market is nowhere near the excesses seen in 1987. On a
price-to-earnings basis back then, the market was between 35
percent and 40 percent overvalued. Based on our models, today we
are about 10 percent overvalued. Based on our work, there is a
minimal probability of stocks falling 30 percent from these levels.
And it is a 50-50 proposition that there will be a 10 percent to 15
percent correction. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. So you are looking for the market to trade in a narrow range,
near current levels? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. The market can stay in this narrow range for as long as
things stay as they are, and things are perfect. Perfect is not a
word I use often. The upside is fairly limited, because if you have
paid for perfection, all you have gotten is a normal return. The
other negative thing with perfection is that things can only get
worse. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. It sounds as if you would be happy to close the books on 1999
right now. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. You are going to have to work hard in the next six months to
do better than you did in the first half of the year.
</P>
<P>
   In a flat market, reasonably good stock selection should give
you a return of 5 percent to 10 percent. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Which stocks have the potential to provide that sort of
return? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. We have a highlighted list of 31 names, most of them bigger
companies, which really have an advantage because they are actually
raising prices without creating inflation because they are making
better products.
</P>
<P>
   We like a lot of big technology companies, including America
Online and Microsoft, drug companies like Warner-Lambert and Pfizer
and consumer-oriented companies like Wal-Mart, Carnival Cruise
Lines and Bed, Bath and Beyond. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Still, compared with the past few years those sorts of
returns sound puny. Are the years of double-digit annual gains in
the stock market ending?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I would advise someone who has been asleep for the last 20
years to get their yield from the bond market and expect 5 percent
to 10 percent gains from equities. Those people missed the
opportunity of a lifetime. We have gone through a repricing of
financial assets that has run its course. Going forward, there is
no fundamental reason we can support financial assets that return
20 percent annually. &QL;

GORE URGES WIRING ALL SCHOOLS FOR INTERNET TO OVERCOME `DIGITAL
DIVIDE' &HT;    
 &HT;   
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   &HT;    By JOANN ZUNIGA
 &HT;    c.1999 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Vice President Al Gore called public schools ``a
national emergency'' Friday and proposed that all schools, old and
new, be wired for Internet access to prevent ``the digital divide''
from widening.
</P>
<P>
   Receiving a standing ovation from a convention of minority
journalists, the Democratic presidential front-runner said: ``We
have failing schools in too many places, not just urban areas. We
should recognize it for what it is _ a national emergency.''
</P>
<P>
   The same group of journalists expressed dissatisfaction on
Thursday with Republican front-runner George W. Bush. Bush had
initially declined their invitation to speak at the conference even
though he was campaigning in Seattle anyway. Then, prompted by
newspaper criticism, Bush showed up and did a brief walk-through of
the convention center.
</P>
<P>
   A recently released U.S. Commerce Department study showed a
``digital divide'' and lack of access to technology among
minorities and rural areas.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the $2 billion-a-year upgrade of schools with
computer equipment and training, Gore recommended wireless
computers for older schools rather than more costly drilling of
their infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can we reach every school and library? I say yes. We need to
launch an all-out crusade to stop the digital divide,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   With a majority of U.S. companies reporting a shortage of
skilled workers, Gore said investment needs to be doubled and
possible tax cuts expanded for research and development to solve
the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Diversity is not important merely for political reasons, but
it's a way to give access to extend economic opportunity,'' Gore
said.
</P>
<P>
   With African-American national purchasing power at $360 billion
and Hispanics at $280 billion, U.S. minorities are among the top 20
economies of the world, exceeding many countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why I was appalled at the stories of advertisers not
using ethnic radio stations. Advertising discrimination is not only
wrong, it's immoral,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Recalling his previous newspaper-reporter job in Tennessee, Gore
said he realizes that less than 12 percent of newsroom staff
members are minorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Democracy is deepened and strengthened when the newsroom
reflects the diversity of the community. Self-government and
dialogue is fuller, richer, more honest and healthier if it
connects with all the community,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't need any phony like I-200,'' Gore said, referring to
a Washington state initiative that ended state-funded affirmative
action programs.
</P>
<P>
   In opening up the session to feedback, moderator Jean Gaddy
Wilson said, ``You can't come to a convention full of journalists
and not have tough questions thrown your way.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore retorted, ``You can't come to this part of the convention
without tough questions.''
</P>
<P>
   He touched his finger to his tongue and chalked up a one in the
air as the audience applauded, catching Gore's reference to Bush's
quick walk-through of the convention's job fair Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was asked what he would do, if elected president, to stop
the assault on affirmative action in Florida and other states.
</P>
<P>
   Saying he had spoken out repeatedly in support of affirmative
action, Gore said, ``I think those who claim this is a colorblind
society are like hunters who use a duck blind to hide behind and
hope the ducks don't notice.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides Gore and Bush, two other presidential hopefuls, former
Sen. Bill Bradley and Sen. John McCain of Arizona, also appeared at
the convention, the largest single gathering of journalists in the
nation.

<P>
   LONDON _ The Cleveland Museum of Art emerged Friday as the buyer
of the most prized painting in Thursday's blockbuster sale of
Rothschild family treasures: a Frans Hals portrait of a stern-faced
Amsterdam merchant that commanded $12.8 million, a record for the
artist.
</P>
<P>
   The painting, a three-quarter-length portrait of Tieleman
Roosterman bedecked in black with white ruffled collar and cuffs,
will go on view in two weeks, museum officials said. The
transaction at least partly alleviates fears that important pieces
of the Rothschild collection, which had been displayed since World
War II in Austrian museums, would disappear into private hands.
</P>
<P>
   The sale at Christie's, which totaled $89.9 million, was one of
the most successful European auctions ever, doubling its
anticipated value and breaking 10 records for such categories as
illuminated manuscripts, furniture and carpets sold at auction. The
Roosterman portrait, one of three by Hals that were auctioned, sold
for more than four times the previous record price for the Dutch
master.
</P>
<P>
   The 218 lots were sold by members of the Austrian branch of the
Jewish banking family, who this year had the trove of Old Master
paintings, exquisite furnishings and prized historical scientific
instruments returned to them by the Austrian government 61 years
after they were seized by the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   After the war family members reached an agreement with the
government that allowed them to leave the country with many of
their possessions provided they left others behind. Many of the
holdings were displayed in Viennese museums until the culture
minister, Elisabeth Gehrer, decided last year to return them,
calling the postwar decisions immoral.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's auction packed Christie's Great Hall for hours of
frenzied bidding, but as is frequently the case, the identity of
many of the buyers is still a matter of speculation. Visibly active
in the salesroom were many members of other branches of the
Rothschild family, notably Elie and Lilliane de Rothschild of
Paris, who were sitting with Christopher Balfour, a vice chairman
of Christie's board. Mrs. Rothschild was seen vigorously bidding on
several items, buying a few scientific instruments along with a
southern German gilt-metal clock case, circa 1550, intricately
decorated with Greek myths of Orpheus and Eurydice. Mrs. Rothschild
paid $148,105 for the items, which were expected to sell for $8,200
and to $16,000.
</P>
<P>
   She also bought a gilt bronze and steel press dating from the
second half of the 16th century that Christie's experts thought
could fetch $12,000 to $16,000. Mrs. Rothschild paid $64,000.
</P>
<P>
   A member of the English branch of the Rothschild family was a
buyer, too. Jane Rick, the director of Spencer House, one of the
grandest London town houses, which was rescued from decay by Lord
Rothschild and restored under his direction, bought a Venetian
gilt-painted copper and bronze lantern, circa 1700, for $37,649.85.
That was just above its high estimate of $32,000. She was thought
to be bidding on behalf of Lord Rothschild.
</P>
<P>
   The Hals portrait of Roosterman will be reunited in Cleveland
with another portrait by the artist that the museum bought from the
Rothschilds in 1948, from the part of their collection they were
able to take with them. That work, ``Portrait of a Woman'' (whose
identity has not been established), like the one of Roosterman, was
painted around 1630.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an exceptional painting, perfect for our collection,''
said Kate M. Sellers, acting director of the Cleveland Museum of
Art.
</P>
<P>
   That the museum was determined to get the painting was evident
at Christie's on Thursday night. Clovis Whitfield, a London dealer,
who was bidding on behalf of the institution, beat out four other
bidders. The previous record for the artist was set in London in
1997 when ``St. John the Evangelist'' sold at Sotheby's for $2.9
million.
</P>
<P>
   At least one other auctioned object will remain on public view,
not in Cleveland but at Versailles. The French museum paid $10.9
million for a commode made by Jean-Henri Riesener, the finest
cabinetmaker employed by Louis XVI. The price was more than two and
a half times the estimate for the piece.

MEASURING THE FORCE OF THE EURO 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By JOHN TAGLIABUE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ Six months into the euro era, some of the assumptions
about how European stock markets would behave once the single
currency arrived are looking shaky.
</P>
<P>
   One theory, for instance, had it that the euro would shift
market volatility to industry sectors and away from individual
national markets. Indexes would be moved more by, say, European
auto sales figures than by a political crisis in Italy or France.
Some people even predicted the end of single-country mutual funds,
as Europe transformed itself into a market like the United States,
where investors watch chemicals, automobiles or electronics, and
not necessarily the Northeast or the Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, European stock markets appeared headed in that
direction, with announcements of planned mergers involving
exchanges in Frankfurt, London, Paris, Milan and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   But in the euro's first half-year, it has not worked out quite
that way, at least yet. Borders still count along with sectors in
investment decisions, and national stock markets have been casting
up widely differing returns. While France, Germany and Finland made
big gains in the last six months, Belgium and Portugal have
slumped, and Spain and Italy have been somewhat listless.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the explanation is that the euro's arrival has sent huge
amounts of capital across national borders as currency hurdles have
fallen.
</P>
<P>
   Whereas a German asset manager like Commerzbank previously had
more than half its funds in German stocks, that fraction has now
dropped to one-third, said Nils Stoerling, chief investment officer
at the bank's asset management arm in Frankfurt. The pattern has
repeated itself across the Continent, pushing up some markets and
hurting others as institutions redeploy their money.
</P>
<P>
   In Spain, about 70 percent of fresh capital is going into
Europe-wide investments, and only 30 percent into Spanish shares,
said Eduardo Suarez, head of asset management at Santander Gestion
de Activos in Madrid. A result: The Madrid stock index fell from a
high in January before gaining ground again this month. ``The
appetite for euro equities is outstanding,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The shift is not only geographical. Money is also flowing from
the stocks of small companies _ those with a market value of $300
million to $1.5 billion _ into large-capitalization European
corporations that are the elite of European business. ``It is
something we saw from about a year ago,'' said Felix Lanters, head
of European equity investment at ABN Amro Asset Management in
Amsterdam. ``And it is one reason why the big caps are
outperforming the market. There is interest in top names.''
</P>
<P>
   Commerzbank, Stoerling said, used to follow the old DAX
100-stock index of German companies. Now, its asset managers have
assembled a 270-stock index, he said, with almost two-thirds of the
companies spread across Euroland, as the euro nations are called,
plus Switzerland and Britain, which have not adopted the currency.
</P>
<P>
   As had been expected, many European asset managers are also
reorganizing their research, shifting it from individual European
countries to industry sectors or a blend of the two. ``We started
looking at sectors six years ago,'' said David Duncan, of Global
Asset Management in London.
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, his firm still casts ``generally, a final glance''
at geography, ``to make sure you're not 95 percent in Finland,
because you've liked the looks of Nokia,'' the hugely popular
Finnish phone company.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Taze-Bernard, chief investment officer in Luxembourg at
Paribas Asset Management, said many institutional investors now
combine sector and regional analysis. Their reluctance to jettison
regional factors, e said, was a result of their rejection of a
``false idea about economic convergence.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than forcing European economies to march more closely in
step, he said, the euro's imposition of uniform interest rates on
differing national economies has served to sharpen cyclical
differences. Lower European interest rates may help spur growth in
slow economies, like Germany's or Italy's, but can overheat
economies that are purring nicely, like Ireland's.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, many asset managers expect the drive into
European large-cap companies to continue. Suarez of Santander
estimated that ``only about 30 percent of the reorganization is
done,'' and said it would take one to two more years before capital
flows began shifting away from large-cap companies in major
economies like Germany and France and toward small-cap companies in
markets like Ireland, Belgium and Portugal.
</P>
<P>
   The shifting capital flows, however, are enhanced by a flood of
new money that is likely to lift European stocks over all, experts
say. J. Paul Horne, an economist at Salomon Smith Barney in London,
said European transfers from traditional forms of savings, like
bank accounts and life insurance, to stocks and corporate bonds
would probably total about $1 trillion in two to three years,
buoying European markets.
</P>
<P>
   And the current strength of the dollar against the euro adds to
the possible allure of European stocks for American investors.
Since it was introduced, the euro has fallen from nearly $1.18 to
just below $1.02 on Friday. A rebound in the euro's value would add
to European stock market returns in dollars. ``The euro, having hit
a trough,'' he said, ``adds to the attractiveness of European
securities.''  &QL;

WITH THE STARS, SPURS AND STONE COLD, TEXAS RULES THE SPORTS WORLD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICHIE WHITT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   We tried to warn y'all: Don't Mess with Texas.
</P>
<P>
   But you didn't take us seriously, didja? You supposed
know-it-alls just scoffed at our slushy ice, giggled at our baggy
knickers and shrugged off our gangly Twin Towers.
</P>
<P>
   Who's laughing now, cow-chip breath? While you were busy being
dumber than a tumbleweed, our Lone Star State has blossomed into
the Multiple SuperStars State, transforming the sports world into a
private stage of Texas Triumphs.
</P>
<P>
   If y'all agree to slide into a pair of snakeskin boots, slip on
a Stetson and twang a sincere rendition of ``Deep in the Heart of
Texas'', then, and only then, might we let you peek at our Stars'
Stanley Cup, Payne Stewart's U.S. Open title or the San Antonio
Spurs' NBA championship.
</P>
<P>
   In case you've forgotten, we also own the Heisman Trophy, the
only two WNBA titles, a World Boxing Association championship belt,
a pro wrestling No. 1 ranking and have four feet firmly locked
around the Women's World Cup. And, assuming they got the memo
outlining our plan for world domination, the division-leading
Rangers and division-contending Houston Astros are fixin' to play
in the World Series in October.
</P>
<P>
   Everything always has been bigger in Texas. Now, it's also
better.
</P>
<P>
   With our teams and players delivering a Texas Two-Step right on
your skeptical kissers, don't mind if we stop to pat ourselves on
the back. With the sports world gripped in a Texas state of mind,
our pride is at an all-time high.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, we're not quite perfect. We admit to Leon Lett's
addiction, Leon Smith's immaturity, Juan Gonzalez's pouting and
Larry Johnson's miserable existence as an $84 million ``rebellious
slave.'' But if you will bow toward where the West begins and pick
any legitimate sport this side of the X-Games, you'll find you a
tangy Texas flavor:
BASEBALL
Our two division contenders were a combined 20 games over .500
entering last night's games and produced eight All-Stars. And maybe
you've heard of a fireball pitcher from Alvin who will be inducted
into the Hall of Fame on July 25?
FOOTBALL
By breaking every collegiate rushing record and winning the Heisman
at Texas, Ricky Williams convinced New Orleans Saints coach Mike
Ditka to surrender every draft choice and right-of-first-refusal on
the Louisiana Purchase to get him. And you know we've grown up from
being only a ``football state'' when America's Team is struggling
just to remain Texas' Team.
BASKETBALL
Granted, our Mavericks are so screwed up that last year they came
out of the draft with a German teen-ager (Dirk Nowitzki) and spent
all summer trying to convince him to come to America, only to turn
around and this year come out of the draft with an American teen
(Smith), with the intent of shipping him off to Europe. But
overshadowing them is the fact that we boast the best women's team
_ the Houston Comets _ and the best active player on the planet _
Tim Duncan.
HOCKEY
It was a goal, and it is a dent. If the first Southern team to win
the title doesn't deserve the right to launch the Cup from a
second-story balcony into a pool, who does? The Cups runneth over
in Texas, where the Houston Aeros of the Internationl Hockey
League, the sport's Triple A minor-league equivalent, won the
Turner Cup with a stunning seven-game championship series victory
against Orlando.
AUTO RACING
Corpus Christi native Bobby Labonte is second in the Winston Cup
points race, Plano's Greg Ray won the IRL's Radison 200 two weeks
ago, and, after some tinkering, we're finally proud as punch of our
Texas Motor Speedway.
BOWLING
Late leader of the senior PBA's Northern California Classic is _
who else? _ Dale Eagle, from _ where else? _ Lewisville.
GOLF
Tiger Woods had the roaring gallery, Phil Mickelson had the
Major-with-the-Pager storyline, but SMU's Stewart had the biggest
heart and smallest nerves.
TENNIS
We've been known to tell a tall tale, and admittedly this is a
stretch. But Wimbledon sensation Alexandra Stevenson and first-time
champion Lindsay Davenport mastered the grass only after being
coached by Dallas' Craig Kardon, a former Fort Worth-based
instructor who helped Martina Navratilova serve-and-volley her way
into the Hall of Fame.
TRACK
In case you've already forgotten about Michael Johnson, we present
former Trimble Tech High School and TCU star Khadevis Robinson,
winner of the men's 800 meters at the USA Outdoor Championships.
PRO WRESTLING
WWF champ Stone Cold Steve Austin was a promising defensive end at
North Texas until referees kept flagging his trademark ``stunner''
move for illegal hands to the face.
CYCLING
Greg LeWho? Having pedaled past testicular cancer, Plano native
Lance Armstrong won the prologue of the Tour de France and remains
among the race leaders as they head into the mountains.
RODEO
Superman in Chaps was born in Stephenville. Seven-time all-around
champ Ty Murray recently earned $41,000 during an eight-day span of
Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association competition, shattering the
former PRCA mark for money earned in a similar time frame by
$22,000.
SOCCER
The Burn may be a ho-hum 9-9, but bet y'all didn't realize that
U.S. women's team standout Carla Overbeck went to Richardson High
School and Mia Hamm scored her goals at Wichita Falls' Notre Dame
High in '87. Hamm's becoming as popular this summer as another star
with Texas ties _ ``Austin'' Powers.
BOXING
</P>
<P>
   There are so many divisions and classifications that any state
without a champion ought to be ashamed. We got ours, newly crowned
WBA bantamweight champ Paulie Ayala, from Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Sure it's braggin,' but we can back it up. Y'all still not
convinced?
</P>
<P>
   Then go cryin' to your next president, Texas Gov. George W.
Bush.

CHANGES DOWN THE FOOD CHAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (Sidebar to BANDWIDTH-TELECOM)  
(For release Sun., July 11) 
(jt) 
 By SETH SCHIESEL    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   If long-distance phone service is becoming a commodity and
bandwidth is being traded at the wholesale level for pennies a
minute, some everyday telephone users may be wondering why their
phone bills are becoming more complicated and sometimes going up.
</P>
<P>
   The answer is as unfortunate for the relatively unwired as it is
welcome for the long-distance industry: You have to spend in order
to save.
</P>
<P>
   The falling cost of long-distance capacity is leading to
drastically lower per-minute rates. Some small carriers, like IDT
Corp., offer flat rates as low as 8 cents a minute for calls at any
time to anywhere in the country.
</P>
<P>
   But many consumers who want the psychological comfort and
gold-plated service of a big-name carrier are now facing monthly
minimum charges. AT&AMP;T, for instance, recently began charging its
basic rate customers _ those who do not sign up for a special
calling plan _ a $3 monthly minimum. MCI Worldcom also charges many
of its basic rate customers a monthly minimum of up to $5. The
carriers justify the charges by explaining that they were incurring
more costs in billing and tracking low-volume customers than they
were taking in as per-minute fees.
</P>
<P>
   Regulatory changes have made bills even more complex.
Long-distance bills include a monthly charge of about $1 to cover
the cost of offering local service in poor and rural communities,
as well as a flat fee of at least $1 to cover the cost of linking
long-distance and local networks.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers were paying for these things before, but as part of
higher per-minute rates. With the Telecommunications Act of 1996,
those fees are now flat and explicit, while per-minute rates have
declined.

GORE DEFENDS AFFIRMATIVE ACTION IN TALK TO MINORITY JOURNALISTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ A relentlessly serious Vice President Al Gore used two
Seattle speeches Friday to defend affirmative action, call for
removal of foreign countries' trade barriers, and pledge to assure
that Americans of all backgrounds and means get access to the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Gore came loaded with statistics and specifics as he addressed
the UNITY '99 minority journalists conference and a Washington
Council on International Trade luncheon.
</P>
<P>
   Using the tale of a Hungarian village that sounds a trumpet to
mark a 600-year-old tragedy, Gore lampooned those who claim America
is a ``colorblind'' society less than a generation after the
Supreme Court struck down school desegregation and Congress passed
civil rights laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``They use `colorblind' in the way some people use a duck
blind,'' Gore told the journalists. ``They hide behind it and hope
no one will notice.''
</P>
<P>
   The vice president denounced Initiative 200, passed by
Washington voters in 1998, which struck down affirmative action
programs in hiring by public agencies and admission to state
colleges.
</P>
<P>
   ``The arrows (of racial hate) are still flying through the
air,'' he said. Gore argued that affirmative action ``ought to be
part of the arsenal'' used to remedy inequities in U.S. society.
</P>
<P>
   With 96 percent of the world's consumers living outside the
United States, America's ethnic diversity is ``a powerful economic
asset'' in the new global economy, Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Discussing inequities that remain in American society, the vice
president saw a particular gap in access to and use of the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   As he introduced Gore, Gov. Gary Locke cited figures that
ownership of computers in white homes far outstrips that in black
and Hispanic households.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this age of the Internet, we are in danger of leaving
people of color behind,'' Locke said. The governor warned of ``the
racial ravine now developing in the on-line world.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore took up the theme. ``We need a national crusade to close
the digital divide before it gets wider,'' he said. ``We need to
have storefront computing centers and libraries where this access
is guaranteed.''
</P>
<P>
   With his bid for the White House, and interest in technology,
Gore has become Seattle's most frequent official visitor from
Washington, D.C. _ this was his third trip this year.
</P>
<P>
   Relaxed, animated and funny last month during his presidential
announcement tour, Gore Friday gave long, figure-laden answers. He
often digressed into detail.
</P>
<P>
   Locke, a politician also known as a policy wonk, defended Gore's
penchant for details and took a swing at Texas Gov. George W.
Bush's symbol-heavy visit to the state on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people want substance,'' the governor said. ``They
want a president who understands problems of the information age.
The vice president knows this stuff. He is not just touring the
state doing photo opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore sought to raise expectations for November's World Trade
Organization meeting in Seattle. He pledged that the Clinton
administration will use the WTO session to work for reductions in
agricultural tariffs and ``outright elimination of Europe's export
subsidies.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an opportunity to break down foreign barriers that
have cost us jobs here at home,'' Gore declared.
</P>
<P>
   Only one incumbent vice president in the past 150 years _ George
Bush, father of the Texas governor, in 1988 _ has won election to
the White House. Gore has trailed Gov. Bush in recent polls, and as
yet has seemed unable to give a clear idea of how his presidency
would be different from President Clinton's.
</P>
<P>
   Gore used Friday's stopover to test themes that will set him
apart _ but not too far apart _ from Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   He talked about shortcomings in public education, from use of
outdated textbooks that talk about the Soviet Union to rundown
school buildings.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can you expect kids to learn the Internet if in some
schools you blow the electricity if you plug in a computer?'' Gore
asked.
</P>
<P>
   He likened today's educational challenge to that facing the
World War II generation when it came home from battle. ``After
saving Pvt. Ryan, they came home and saved public education,'' Gore
said.
</P>
<P>
   With Bush as a likely opponent, Gore has begun to talk about how
hard up America was, in the view of Democrats, when the Clinton
administration took office in 1993. It is a ploy that Republicans
used for 10 years after Jimmy Carter was driven from office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember the high unemployment,'' Gore intoned Friday.
``Remember the record deficits. Remember the policy paralysis.
Remember those days when the right hand didn't know what the far
right hand was doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore is also courting Democratic constituencies dissatisfied
with Clinton's perceived lack of support.
</P>
<P>
   At the trade luncheon, with a bevy of labor leaders on hand, he
said that labor standards and environmental protection ``are not
second class issues anymore'' in negotiating trade agreement.
</P>
<P>
   After pointed criticism at UNITY '99 over the Clinton
administration's failure to name an Asian American to the cabinet,
Gore met privately yesterday morning with Asian American
representatives. In public, he decried racial stereotyping around
the investigation of alleged leaks of U.S. missile technology to
China.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way some people talked about this served to increase
discrimination against Chinese Americans,'' Gore asserted. He noted
that the country has 150,000 Chinese American scientists at work in
a wide variety of fields.
</P>
<P>
   During his UNITY '99 appearance, Gore was sharply challenged by
Derrick Jackson of the National Association of Black Journalists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of ... calling I-200 phony, which is easy to do, would
you do something that Clinton did not do, which is fight for
affirmative action in the white communities and the white
boardrooms of America?'' Jackson asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``My recollection is he did speak out,'' Gore said of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But he quickly moved on, arguing that racial barriers remain and
must be removed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pledge to you I will do all I can to close the opportunity
gaps,'' Gore said. ``We don't need more scapegoats or more phony
ballot propositions like I-200. We need to all examine the kinds of
attitudes that crop up in response to national problems and
national debates.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With calls to ``pillory Hillary,'' conservative and
Republican organizations are mobilizing to raise millions of
dollars all over the country in an effort to crush Hillary Rodham
Clinton's all-but-certain Senate candidacy in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton has long been an object of scorn for large numbers
of conservative groups, all the more so since she attributed the
investigation of the Monica Lewinsky scandal to a ``vast right-wing
conspiracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Now her expected bid for public office has inspired fierce
opposition and a flow of checks from conservatives in far-flung
places like Alabama and New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the groups behind this effort are hoping to expand
their own donor base as well as raise money that they say they will
spend to prevent Mrs. Clinton from becoming the next senator from
New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to take more than a village to defeat Hillary
Clinton,'' Winton Blount III, chairman of the Alabama Republican
Party, wrote in asking 10,000 donors for checks of $50 or $100, to
be spent on a Senate election more than 1,000 miles away. Other
groups are mailing similar letters.
</P>
<P>
   It is not the prospect of achieving victory for Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani, or any other Republican candidate, that is inspiring the
leaders of these organizations. They say their goal is simply to
keep Mrs. Clinton out of the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's less motivated by the Republican we want to win _ it's
motivated by preventing her to be elected to the United States
Senate,'' said Craig Shirley, a conservative Republican consultant
who helped organize Conservatives for Effective Leadership, a
political action committee formed here last month with the goal of
raising $10 million to pay for advertisements against Mrs. Clinton
in New York State next year.
</P>
<P>
   New York Republicans had mixed reactions to the outside efforts
against Mrs. Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very pleased to have organizations outside New York
looking to defeat Hillary Clinton,'' said Dan Allen, a spokesman
for the state party. ``We feel she is only coming up here to run
for president in 2004.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Teitelbaum, director of Giuliani's exploratory committee,
said the mayor would attend fund-raisers in Alabama later this
month for his Senate campaign, but sought to distance Giuliani from
the anti-Clinton fund-raising drives.
</P>
<P>
   ``What other groups are doing, and state parties are doing, in
respect to raising money, it's not something we're connected to,''
Teitelbaum said.
</P>
<P>
   One Republican strategist involved in the Senate race in New
York doubted that the contributions aimed at defeating Mrs. Clinton
would benefit her Republican opponent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see it as a tremendous benefit to any candidate,''
this strategist said. ``This is what the Republicans did with Ted
Kennedy and the Democrats did with Newt Gingrich. Every
fund-raising group in the world loves a bogyman.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard Wolfson, the spokesman for Mrs. Clinton's exploratory
committee, declined to comment on the conservative groups' efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Shirley's PAC, raising money from across the country, was
created, its literature says, to ``educate voters about unqualified
candidates.'' But Shirley confirmed that it would devote all its
energies in the next year and a half to the effort to defeat one
candidate: Mrs. Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a fund-raising standpoint, anyone on the right who
doesn't target Hillary is a fool,'' Shirley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I run just one cell of the vast right-wing conspiracy,'' he
said. ``The sophistry that she was selling when she coined that
phrase was that Monica was part of some right-wing conspiracy, that
we had put her up to stalking the president. Of course, that wasn't
true.''
</P>
<P>
   Some groups started raising money against Mrs. Clinton weeks
before she began her ``listening tour'' in New York on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured that a lot of the Clinton haters would come out of
the woodwork,'' said Charles Lewis, founder and executive director
of the Center for Public Integrity, a campaign finance watchdog.
``I just thought it would take a few more weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   It is unlikely that all the money netted by the anti-Clinton
appeals will really be spent in New York; various conservative
groups have long used President Clinton and his wife as
fund-raising targets. But whatever is spent in New York will only
add to what already appears virtually certain to be the most
expensive Senate race in history.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's supporters hope to raise $25 million for her
campaign, and her most likely Republican opponent, Giuliani, hopes
to raise an equal amount. If other organizations, like the
Democratic and Republican national committees, make good on their
promise to spend millions on issue advertisements, the race could
end up costing $100 million, political strategists say.
</P>
<P>
   Fund-raising strategists say that the anti-Hillary fervor of the
Republican organizations demonstrates that Mrs. Clinton has already
assumed her husband's role as a magnet for checks when her name is
cited in conservative fund-raising letters.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican National Committee mentioned Mrs. Clinton's
health care policies in recent written and telephone solicitations
for cash. ``It has been a huge success,'' said Clifford D. May, the
committee's communications director. ``There is no question that
Hillary Clinton and her policies energize the Republican activists.
She is a polarizing figure.''
</P>
<P>
   Following Alabama's lead, the New Hampshire Republican Party
will also ask 10,000 New Hampshire Republicans to contribute money
to defeat Mrs. Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had eight years of Clinton-Gore,'' said Steve Duprey,
the party chairman. ``Why would we let yet another Clinton do it in
the United States Senate? I predict it will be one of our most
effective fund-raising letters. She is a figure that energizes the
Republican base.''

<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ When Julie Foudy attended the 1994 men's
World Cup final at the Rose Bowl, the 1999 world soccer
championship for women was five years on the horizon and was still
being planned for small stadiums on the East Coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were saying, `No, that's not what this deserves, that's not
what it is worth,''' the American co-captain said. ``When they
moved it to bigger stadiums, we were like, `Right on, this is
something we can do.' We knew we had the personalities and the
talent. We just needed to be promoted better.''
</P>
<P>
   Convinced of their own appeal beyond the grass roots soccer
community, the American players were right. Saturday's Women's
World Cup final between the United States and China will attract a
sellout crowd of about 90,000 at the Rose Bowl, which would be the
largest audience ever to watch a women's sporting event in the
United States, and, organizers believe, in the world.
</P>
<P>
   A soccer tournament that relatively few people knew existed a
month ago has commanded such legitimacy and buzz that scalpers are
seeking as much as $1,000 for a pair of tickets that would normally
sell for $110 apiece. The match will be broadcast to a national
television audience by ABC, and will provide the American women
their grandest stage on which to display their soccer skills and to
convince sponsors and promoters that there is a need for a
professional league in this country following the 2000 Summer
Olympics in Sydney, Australia.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we look back in 20 years, I really think we are going to
say that the Billie Jean King-Bobby Riggs tennis match, Title IX
and the 1999 Women's World Cup are the three largest pillars
supporting women's sports in this country,'' said April Heinrichs,
a star of the women's team that won the 1991 World Cup who now
coaches women's soccer at the University of Virginia. ``We've shown
that if you put enough money into women's sports, people will come
to watch it.''
</P>
<P>
   However, victory is by no means certain for the Americans, who
have lost two of three matches this year to China by 2-1 scores,
and are considered by many to be underdogs. With a fast,
technically skilled team that has begun to express individual
creativity and assertiveness after years of regimented, tentative
play, China has swept through its first five games, scoring 19
goals and allowing two. It beat Norway, the defending champion, by
5-0 in the semifinals, the worst defeat in its history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think China, all-around, is technically the better
side,'' Greg Brown, the Australian coach, said after his team lost,
3-1, to the Chinese. ``They have flair, they have confidence and
they play the ball all around the park.''
</P>
<P>
   The key to success for the Americans appears to rest with their
uncertain defensive back line of Carla Overbeck, Joy Fawcett, Kate
Sobrero and Brandi Chastain. The defense has provided many nervous
moments, especially in the opening minutes of matches, with
momentary lapses that leave the United States vulnerable. The
Americans surrendered a goal to Nigeria in the 2nd minute and put a
ball into their own net five minutes into a quarterfinal match
against Germany.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I think is important for the U.S. team is to improve its
defensive play,'' said Jarl Torske, an assistant coach of Norway.
``Mistakes by the back four will be punished if they do that
against the Chinese.''
</P>
<P>
   While the American defense is experienced, it lacks overall
speed. Sometimes it is also left vulnerable when the defenders
sprint ahead in the aggressive American attack. Pressing forward,
the defense was left open to a counterrattack by the Chinese in
losing by 2-1 in April at Giants Stadium, ending the United States'
50-game home unbeaten streak.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans must be particularly vigilant toward Chinese
forward Sun Wen, who is tied for the lead with seven goals in this
World Cup. Sun is equally dangerous with or without the ball, and
is adept at slipping unnoticed behind a defense, which she did in
chipping a shot over goalkeeper Briana Scurry in that April match
at the Meadowlands.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans normally use a zone defense, but coach Tony
DiCicco said he would consider marking Sun man-to-man, likely with
Overbeck, the captain, or Sobrero, a rugged one-on-one defender.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would just have to be a goon all game long,'' Sobrero said.
``I love that.''
</P>
<P>
   In the midfield, playmaker Liu Ailing organizes a Chinese attack
that wastes no motion in storming down the flanks and that
threatens both with the long ball and with touch passing.
</P>
<P>
   American midfielder Michelle Akers, who smothered Sissi of
Brazil in the semifinals, could be assigned to Liu. Kristine Lilly
and Foudy, the other American midfielders, will be charged with
maintaining possession, working the ball from side to side to
offset the clinging Chinese defense and with providing serviceable
passes to American forwards Mia Hamm, Tiffeny Milbrett and either
Cindy Parlow or Shannon MacMillan.
</P>
<P>
   DiCicco said Friday that he may start MacMillan because she is
faster than Parlow, but he noted that Parlow is a better defender.
Also, placing MacMillan into the lineup at the start would deprive
the Americans of getting a second-half lift by bringing her off the
bench.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans are equal to the Chinese in attack, although Hamm,
the world's leading scorer with 111 international goals, has not
put the ball into the net in the last three matches. Milbrett, a
compact, explosive player, has become the team's most reliable
scorer. MacMillan has a wicked knuckleball of a shot.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans will have an edge with the home crowd and with the
experience of having won the 1991 World Cup and the 1996 Summer
Olympics. China, which finished second at the Atlanta Olympics, has
never won a major tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our experience is one up on them,'' Milbrett said. ``Quite
possibly, we might be a little more competitive than them. Not by
much, but I think that helps.'' &QL;

 By ALLEN R. MYERSON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ When it comes to dynasties, Gov. George W. Bush has
said that his father's idea of the perfect son was Al Gore. Ross
Perot's idea of the perfect son is Ross Perot Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Lest Ross Jr. have any doubts about what was expected of him,
his father wrote it all down. At his college graduation, Ross Sr.
presented him with ``Everything I Know About Business,'' a treatise
that later filled 62 pages in the elder Perot's autobiography.
``Avoid undertaking new projects on a grand scale,'' it advised _
at least until after completing some low-risk trials.
</P>
<P>
   Two decades later, Ross Jr. has become the leading real estate
developer in a state where builders can wield more power than
governors or mayors. And now he is bending some of his father's
rules as he sets out to transform a swath of downtown Dallas the
size of about 19 Manhattan blocks into office buildings,
apartments, shopping concourses and a sports arena that, he boasts,
will give this city its own Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd better go back and read the guidelines,'' the younger
Perot said with his usual purposeful frown, sitting in an office
down the hall from his father's, both of them behind locked and
guarded doors. ``You're going to get me in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Not to worry. Though he is in a different trade than his father,
who built a fortune with one computer services company and has now
gone public with another, Perot has proved himself his father's son
in recognizing government as the businessman's best patron.
</P>
<P>
   As his father built his first company, Electronic Data Systems,
on winning government contracts, the son has built his real estate
empire on winning all manner of government support.
</P>
<P>
   His latest project has been based on persuading Dallas voters _
usually stingy with public money _ that they should pay $125
million of the $230 million cost for his basketball team's new
arena, the anchor for a billion-dollar-plus real estate
development.
</P>
<P>
   It has taken Donald Trump 24 years to finish two buildings on
the site of Manhattan's West Side rail yards, a tract of about the
same size. In Dallas, Perot had the dirt flying just two years
after he bought the Dallas Mavericks of the National Basketball
Association in 1996 and a year after his initial downtown
investments.
</P>
<P>
   Touring the site in his black Chevrolet Suburban, his top aides
filling its three benches, Perot bounced over curbs, across
abandoned railroad tracks and past derelict grain elevators, avidly
describing everything he plans _ down to pasting corporate logos on
the overpasses.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some neat naming opportunities on the bridges,'' he
told his assistants. ``Tastefully done.''
</P>
<P>
   Perot has the ready ability to turn his dreams into steel,
concrete and glass. In a business usually run on other people's
money, he uses large amounts of his own, gathered from earlier real
estate investments that he made with his father.
</P>
<P>
   His successes have had a deeply personal benefit. Even four or
five years ago, questions about how much his father's money and
connections had contributed to his own progress drew pinched
responses. His father was only an investor, Perot would say, while
full, legal, decision-making authority rested with him.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with less to prove, Perot can warmly describe childhood
weekends spent looking over real estate with his father. Or, for
all the unwanted attention of being a Perot, the considerable
benefits that the name carries. ``The key thing is certainly you
can go see people,'' he said. ``They'll take your phone calls.''
</P>
<P>
   Congenital determination, as well as money, may allow Perot to
bring the ailing center of this city a revival that has been beyond
the abilities of anyone else. To buy the Mavericks, he had to
muscle aside Thomas O. Hicks, Dallas' own leveraged-buyout king.
Even though Hicks said he could build an arena for a city
investment of just $40 million or $50 million, Perot persuaded
civic leaders to allot about three times as much. Hicks and Perot
became partners in the project, although Perot remained the
developer.
</P>
<P>
   His headstrong ways have decisively shaped his image. No other
Texas builder is so eagerly courted or publicly reviled. To those
who have opposed the arena or his other vast projects, he is a
ruthless privateer intent on raiding the public's purse.
</P>
<P>
   Early last year in Dallas, Perot and Hicks spent $2 million to
gain voter approval of arena subsidies. An opposition group calling
itself ``It's a Bad Deal'' spent just $75,000 but came within 1,700
votes of winning. The group's members continue to shadow Perot.
``This guy is the biggest welfare baby the public has ever seen,''
Sharon Boyd, the group's leader and a former member of the Dallas
Planning Commission, said months after the vote. ``What has he ever
done without public assistance? His daddy built his own company
with public assistance.''
</P>
<P>
   Perot responds that the jobs and tax revenues produced by his
projects far exceed any public costs. And, as he coolly told other
developers last fall at the annual meeting of the Urban Land
Institute here, braving opposition is his duty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Half of this business is politics,'' he said, in a measured
corporate monotone that contrasts with his father's buzz-saw twang.
``As real estate developers, it's our job to go in there and get
beat up.''
</P>
<P>
   His father, back at Perot Systems after two presidential
campaigns, remains a walking editorial cartoon, a rambunctious runt
with a tomahawk profile. The son, at 5 feet 11 inches, has
conventional broad-shouldered good looks _ as perfectly pressed,
meticulously slicked back and emotionally composed as if he had
rumbled loose from a marble monument to Texas deal-makers.
</P>
<P>
   The older Perot argues that a Texas habit _ calling the father
``Big'' and the son ``Little'' when they share a given name _
shouldn't apply to him and his son. ``He's Big Ross and I'm Old
Ross, and there's no better place to live than in your son's
shadow,'' he says.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In politics, however, the younger Perot, apart from favoring
free trade, stays out of his father's way. Recalling the uproar
over his 1992 donation to President Bush's re-election campaign
before his father joined the race, he has refused to back Governor
Bush's presidential campaign until his father's plans are clear.
``I've learned my lessons,'' Perot said. ``I'm staying on the
sidelines for Dad.'' (Dad, while saying he prefers business to
politics, won't rule out another race.)
</P>
<P>
   At 40, Big Ross is less exciting than his father but also less
excitable _ a reflection of the influence of his mother, Margot,
family friends say. As the oldest of five children and the only
son, one friend said, ``Ross Jr. was trained for, conditioned for
being in the public eye.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not your normal childhood. His father, an Annapolis
graduate, surrounded his son with military heroes, former prisoners
of war and astronauts. The son distinguished himself as an Air
Force fighter pilot and later as the lead pilot on the first
helicopter trip around the world. Such training is the best
business school, the elder Perot contends, saying, ``When you're
flying a fighter, you don't have time for committee meetings.''
</P>
<P>
   He needs no prompting to tell how he offered his son, then about
14 years old, 75 cents for each bush he would plant along the road
in front of the old EDS headquarters in Dallas. Just inches into
the ground, Ross Jr. struck rock. Rejecting his father's offer to
adjust the price, Ross went at the task with a pickax. Now, his
father says, ``Anytime he buys a piece of real estate, he checks to
see where the rock is.''
</P>
<P>
   And how did he rebel? Anything like George W. Bush's wild living
in earlier days? The younger Perot throws back his head and laughs
with rare abandon. ``It wasn't really part of the program in the
Perot family,'' he says. ``Rebellion was not an option.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, friends say, he was driven to make his own mark, to
give the lie to anyone who dared say that all his advantages were
inherited.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he assumed that he would work for his father. He started
out as a land man, leasing drilling rights for his father's oil
company. He planned to become an EDS salesman, but in 1984 his
father sold the company to General Motors. He decided to turn his
family's real estate holdings into the basis of a business, the
Hillwood Development Corp.
</P>
<P>
   With his father's help, he began buying thousands of acres north
of Fort Worth, counting on the city's continuing sprawl to turn
ranches and farms dotted with post oaks and mesquite into
subdivisions and shopping malls. The city, anticipating added tax
revenue and jobs, was happy to annex his land and provide services.
</P>
<P>
   Though the collapse of the Texas economy in the late 1980s
dashed the Perots' initial plans, they still had the cash to buy
thousands of additional acres from desperate sellers. But Ross
Jr.'s new plan _ to build an air cargo hub to be called Alliance
Airport _ required help from government at all levels. After a tour
in the Hillwood helicopter, Jim Wright of Fort Worth, then the
speaker of the House and a prime beneficiary of the Perots'
campaign donations, pushed a bill through Congress for a far larger
project than the Federal Aviation Administration had recommended.
Federal, state and local governments provided more than $200
million in cash and tax breaks.
</P>
<P>
   Local real estate experts estimate that after some early
reversals, Perot has gained hundreds of millions of dollars turning
his Fort Worth property into the Southwest's largest hub for cargo
shipments. ``Alliance was Ross' EDS,'' said Tom Luce, a Dallas
lawyer and political adviser for father and son.
</P>
<P>
   Perot raised his bet on the area when he bought the 2,500-acre
Circle T Ranch in 1993 for less than $20 million from a desperate,
bankrupt Nelson Bunker Hunt, who had once insisted that he wouldn't
part with it even for $200 million. Perot, then 34, talked of
building a whole new city there, with thousands of office workers,
golfers, shoppers and residents.
</P>
<P>
   But the ranch was in Westlake, a hamlet of 250 affluent
residents who had moved to the country to escape traffic and
crowds.
</P>
<P>
   For Perot, though, not even lines on a map are unalterable. And
so the Westlake aldermen ousted a mayor antagonistic to him and
then gave up two-thirds of the town's property, including the
Circle T. In a special Saturday meeting, the Fort Worth City
Council, eager for development, declared the land Fort Worth's.
Amid ensuing lawsuits, it was unclear just who was the Westlake
Mayor and which city or town could claim the Circle T.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Perot was turning back to Dallas. Pointing out
his office window in North Dallas at the office park where his
father had built EDS and then, in the early 1980s, tried to expand,
Perot delivered a short sermon. ``The neighborhood groups did not
want Dad to fill out the campus,'' he said, and the city sided with
the neighbors. ``That's when Dad left Dallas.''
</P>
<P>
   Left _ and started an exodus, to the northern suburb of Plano.
The elder Perot bought land that accommodated several newcomers,
starting with EDS. ``Then another Dallas company, Frito-Lay, then
Fina, then Dr Pepper moved to Plano,'' Ross Jr. said.
</P>
<P>
   By the mid-1990s, Dallas' leaders presided over one of the
nation's deadest downtowns _ so dead that even Dallas Mayor Ron
Kirk, gazing out his own office window, couldn't resist saying,
``You go on a tour of downtown and its attractions now, and you
ask, `What can we do with the other 45 minutes of the hour?'''
</P>
<P>
   Decades earlier, Perot's father had said he would never run for
public office or buy a sports team. But Ross Jr. figured that if an
airport could cause the value of the surrounding land to soar, why
not an arena?
</P>
<P>
   In early 1996, he bought a 67 percent stake in the Mavericks for
$125 million, bluntly declaring that he was in the game for the
real estate, not love of the sport. ``A lot of people look at a
basketball team as an anchor tenant for an arena,'' he said in
announcing the purchase. ``I look at an arena as the anchor tenant
for a much larger program.''
</P>
<P>
   But first, he wanted to persuade the city to pay up and the
state to let the city raise its taxes for that purpose. The Texas
Legislature, by approving a measure letting Dallas raise its car
rental and hotel taxes, allowed backers to say that the cost would
fall only on city visitors.
</P>
<P>
   When the city then balked at Perot's demand that it pay more
than half of the arena costs, he took to the air in his company's
Bell L-3 helicopter. He carried one suburban mayor after another to
view possible arena sites in their towns. He encouraged television
helicopters to follow, giving their pilots his radio frequency so
that if cameramen missed a shot, he could swoop in again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just like an Air Force mission,'' he said.

   Kirk, pressured earlier to avoid giveaways, was now under
pressure to make a deal. ``Either way, the voters were going to
scream at you,'' he recalled. ``But you didn't want to be a mayor
that let a team walk away from a city that still hasn't gotten over
losing the Cowboys 25 years ago.'' He agreed for the city to pay
$125 million and the team owners just $105 million. In January
1998, voters just barely approved the deal.
</P>
<P>
   To guide his development plans, Perot visited 25 cities from
Shanghai to Berlin and consulted with Edward P. Bass, the Bass
brother who led his family in reviving Fort Worth's downtown.
Setting his usual high-pressure deadline, Perot gave five
architecture firms only four weeks to submit designs, though most
competitions take months.
</P>
<P>
   At the deadline, the architects, gathered at a downtown business
club, all had tales of working every day and many nights. When
Perot told Ricardo Legorreta, Mexico's best-known architect, that
the competition was great fun, Legorreta grinned and answered,
``More fun for you than it is for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Perot's chose David M. Schwarz of Washington and Fort Worth over
Helmut Jahn and other international stars. Schwarz, whose nostalgic
designs have made him royal architect to the Bass family, proposed
an updated brick-and-glass version of a college field house. Perot
says the final design, to be revealed as soon as this week, will be
substantially different.
</P>
<P>
   The arena will be called the American Airlines Center, with the
airline's $190 million payment over 30 years going to the team
owners, not to the city. Perot has dubbed his whole project
Victory, a name he announced at a news conference where a film and
brochure compared his ambitions to those of Churchill, among
others. His design requirements include a victory balcony where
athletes can wave their trophies to crowds below.
</P>
<P>
   The balcony is far more likely to accommodate Hicks' hockey
team, the Dallas Stars, which won the Stanley Cup last month, than
Perot's Mavericks, with a record of 19 wins and 31 losses in this
year's shortened season. Perot points out that his team (20-62 the
year before) is improving.
</P>
<P>
   Perot and Hicks are on the verge of extending their partnership
to the full Victory development, with Hicks saying that he plans to
buy a 50 percent interest.
</P>
<P>
   In Fort Worth, meanwhile, Perot's plans for the Circle T have
come up against officials weary of his muscular tactics. Fidelity
Investments wanted to build a 300-acre office park for 2,700
employees but posed one condition: settlement of the feud with
Westlake, so the company would know what municipality it would be
in. With Westlake having become more receptive, Perot asked Fort
Worth to kindly drop all the Circle T claims he had once
encouraged, arguing that the city would still benefit from
development in a neighboring town.
</P>
<P>
   At that, Fort Worth's leaders reached their limits. They
demanded that Perot repay the city's legal fees and provide other
compensation. After the city blithely let some Perot-imposed
deadlines pass, Perot agreed to build a job training center and buy
water supplies from Fort Worth for 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas, too, expects him to do more than build his
brick-and-mortar fortune. A grateful Kirk has challenged him to
take as much responsibility for his city as the Basses of Fort
Worth have taken for theirs. ``Ross Perot, with his wealth and
experience and family,'' he said, ``can do things for Dallas that
nobody else can do.''

NEW MEDAL FOR AN OLD, OLD SOLDIER: FRANCE HONORS 102-YEAR-OLD U.S.
VETERAN &HT;   
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   &HT;    By BOB TUTT

<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Thomas J. Clark first saw military service in 1916
when the Texas National Guard was futilely trying to catch up with
a revolutionary Mexican leader named Pancho Villa.
</P>
<P>
   When U.S. entry into World War I the next year led to his
call-up for active duty in the Army, Clark wished he could get out
of it. He couldn't, of course.
</P>
<P>
   On the battlefield in France the next year, he served honorably
but came to revile war.
</P>
<P>
   ``War really is hell,'' he recalled.
</P>
<P>
   He expressed this anti-war sentiment to family members Friday
before Pierre Lepetit, the French consul general in Houston,
arrived to present the 102-year-old Clark with the Legion of Honor,
France's highest national award. The presentation was made at the
St. Dominique Village retirement center, where Clark, a widower,
resides.
</P>
<P>
   As a gesture of gratitude, French President Jacques Chirac has
decreed that all Allied servicemen who served on French soil during
World War I should receive this medal and the rank of chevalier,
making Clark a member of the honorary society that dates to the
days of Napoleon.
</P>
<P>
   Chirac issued the decree last year with the approach of the 80th
anniversary of the Nov. 11, 1918, armistice that ended the Great
War.
</P>
<P>
   Lepetit said an estimated 2,000 American veterans are living and
thus eligible for the honor. So far, 600 have been located.
</P>
<P>
   Clark accepted his award graciously.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Thorndale in East Central Texas, he was one of the
million-plus Yanks who participated in the bloody Battle of
Meuse-Argonne in October 1918.
</P>
<P>
   Looking through letters Clark wrote home during the war, Joan
Clark of Houston, a granddaughter, found examples of how he
deplored the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter dated Nov. 6, 1918, which he said was written while
he took shelter in a barn, he told his mother: ``I have been on the
front for three weeks, and believe me, war is what Sherman said it
was. The sight I have seen up there will never be forgotten, and I
hope never to see it again, but if I have to, I can and will do it
like a man.''
</P>
<P>
   And in a Nov. 29, 1918, letter, he wrote, ``Whenever you hear a
man say that he had been under heavy shell fire and was not afraid,
well, you just might call him a big liar, which he is.''
</P>
<P>
   He and three brothers served in the Army in France, and all
survived. After the war, Clark remained in France for a year as a
military policeman. He recalls that year fondly.
</P>
<P>
   When he returned to Texas, he became a tank car dispatcher for
the Missouri Pacific Railroad. While working in Palestine, he
married Ruby Catherine Murrell.
</P>
<P>
   They had been married 66 years when she died in 1990. They had a
son, Donald, now also deceased.
</P>
<P>
   His daughter-in-law, Norma Clark, said Thomas Clark has taken
life's sorrows in stride and has never lost his sense of humor.
</P>
<P>
   He demonstrated that Friday when a television photographer aimed
a bright light at him.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had a pistol,'' Clark joked, ``I'd shoot out that
light.''

RUSSIA CONDUCTED MOCK NUCLEAR STRIKES IN JUNE, DEFENSE MINISTER
SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (EDS: Subs to replace 20th graf previous ``Much of ...'' with new
graf beginning ``The military aim ...'' No pickup.)  (th) 
 By MICHAEL R. GORDON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Reflecting its growing dependence on nuclear weapons
for defense, Russia's military carried out mock nuclear strikes in
a major exercise last month, the defense minister said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The exercise was the largest since the collapse of the Soviet
Union. It involved 50,000 troops, bombers, tanks and warships from
the Barents Sea to the Black Sea.
</P>
<P>
   One of the scenarios for the exercise underscored the expanding
role nuclear weapons are playing in the Russian military's strategy
and plans.
</P>
<P>
   According to the script for the military exercise, disclosed
Friday by Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev, Russia came under attack
by an unspecified Western foe, which used non-nuclear forces.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Russia also tried to limit its attacks to conventional
forces. But its cash-strapped non-nuclear forces failed to stop the
enemy onslaught, forcing Russia's leadership to turn to its still
formidable nuclear arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The exercise tested one of the provisions of Russia's military
doctrine concerning a possible use of nuclear weapons when all
other measures are exhausted,'' Sergeyev said Friday. ``We did
pursue such an option. All measures were exhausted. Our defenses
proved to be ineffective. An enemy continued to push into Russia.
And that's when the decision to use nuclear weapons was made.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Russia has long bristled with nuclear weapons. During
Soviet times, Moscow and Washington piled up huge nuclear arsenals
as they sought to best each other in the arms race.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Russia's conventional forces were enormous. In those
years it was NATO, fearing that it was outnumbered, that openly
threatened to initiate the use of nuclear weapons in response to a
non-nuclear attack.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the Soviet Union has collapsed, however, the tables
have turned. The West has become less dependent on nuclear weapons.
As the conflict with Yugoslavia showed, NATO fights its wars with
laser-guided and satellite-guided non-nuclear bombs and missiles.
</P>
<P>
   But with Russia's military spending projected this year at about
$4 billion (compared with about $260 billion for the Pentagon), the
once-mighty conventional forces have deteriorated.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's forces failed to defeat Chechnya's rebels, and Russian
generals are no longer confident that they can prevail over more
serious threats. And with a faltering economy, nuclear forces are
virtually the only way Russia can lay claim to being a world power.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia's military believes that it must rely more than ever on
the first use of nuclear weapons,'' said Bruce Blair, a specialist
on Russian nuclear capabilities at the Brookings Institution. ``It
is part psychological and partly a planning assumption.''
</P>
<P>
   The first sign of Russia's increasing dependence on nuclear
weapons came in 1993 when the Defense Ministry abandoned the
Soviet-era pledge not to be the first to use nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Then, as NATO's bombing attacks against Yugoslavia reinforced
the sense here that the West has a huge lead in conventional
military technology, President Boris Yeltsin called together his
top national security advisers to discuss plans to compensate for
Russia's faltering conventional capabilities by developing
short-range, tactical nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The projects and plans that were approved remain secret. But
Vladim Putin, the secretary of the security council, said Yeltsin
had approved a ``blueprint for the development and use of
nonstrategic nuclear weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   None of this means that NATO and Russia are necessarily on a
collision course. The Yeltsin government has pledged to cooperate
on arms control, including seeking the Russian Parliament's
approval of the START II treaty reducing strategic nuclear arms.
</P>
<P>
   And on Thursday, Yeltsin enjoined a group of Russian generals to
cooperate with NATO in enforcing the peace in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem of our relations with NATO and the U.S.A. is very
subtle, delicate and difficult,'' Yeltsin said. ``Every one of you
must pursue the same line _ the president's line. We shall
certainly not quarrel with NATO outright, but nor do we intend to
flirt with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia's current exercise, however, demonstrated the competitive
nature of the relationship. The weeklong exercise, which was held
in late June, was planned last year but adapted to take account of
the Yugoslav conflict, including NATO's ability to attack at long
range with precision-guided bombs, Sergeyev said.
</P>
<P>
   The military aim of the exercise was to test command procedures
for defending western Russia and Belarus from an attack from the
West.
</P>
<P>
   ``To verify the authenticity of the decisions and test
procedures for troop control, more than 50 military units
participated in the exercise,'' Sergeyev said. ``There have been
extensive structural changes to the forces in recent years, and we
have to practice their management and regain units' operational
skills.''
</P>
<P>
   During the exercise two old turbo-prop Bear bombers approached
Iceland while a couple of new Blackjack bombers approached Norway.
Russian ships maneuvered under the watchful eyes of Western
reconnaissance ships and aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, the Defense Ministry declined to specify who the
imaginary enemy was. The aim, Sergeyev told the Russian Itar-Tass
news agency, was to rehearse the defeat of the enemy and the
recapture of lost territory.
</P>
<P>
   Some Russian observers were less diplomatic. The Defense
Ministry, the newspaper Nezavisimaya Gazeta noted, refuses to say
who the adversary is.
</P>
<P>
   ``But few doubt that the enemy is NATO's armed forces in
Europe,'' it added.

SAY GOOD BUY _ NOT GOODBYE _ TO CHILDREN'S BIKES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ALYSON WARD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Where are the bicycles of yesteryear?
</P>
<P>
   We thought we noticed a decline in bike riding among our own
kids, but it's apparently worse than we thought. A recent New York
Times news report quoted experts who confirmed that the celebrated
century-old symbol of childhood freedom and transportation is
nearly extinct.
</P>
<P>
   Who's to blame? The story cited, among other factors, parental
fears of crime and traffic, tight scheduling of organized play,
television and computer games, and disappearing sidewalks.
</P>
<P>
   We say it's time to reverse the trend. Buy your child a bike and
revive the pleasure of two-wheelin'. Here's how to get started.
</P>
<P>
   1. First: Pick a bike style that's right for your child.
</P>
<P>
   Choose from five major types of children's bikes, depending on
how and where your child plans to ride.
</P>
<P>
   STANDARD JUVENILE BIKE: Younger kids need a basic bike to learn
on. A standard bike will have coaster brakes and removable training
wheels. A good feature to look for is a hand brake to go along with
the coaster brakes; it's a safer way to get used to hand brakes.
</P>
<P>
   BMX RACER BIKE: This is a single-speed bike with a steel frame
and steel wheels. Functional and extremely popular.
</P>
<P>
   MOUNTAIN BIKE: This type of bike is multipurpose. It has several
gears and can be used for casual neighborhood riding or more
serious trail riding.
</P>
<P>
   FREESTYLE BIKE: The handlebars will rotate 360 degrees on a
freestyle bike, for tricks and ramp riding.
</P>
<P>
   JUMP BIKE: Described as ``a freestyle bike on steroids,'' the
jump bike has a heavier but stronger frame, stronger wheels and a
shorter reach. This allows riders to jump from ramps, jump curbs,
jump just about anything.
</P>
<P>
   2. Check for quality.
</P>
<P>
   Is there any real difference between the $50 bike at the
discount department store and the twice-as-pricey one at the bike
shop? For the most part, experts say yes.
</P>
<P>
   What makes the difference? In general, what it's made of. The
cheaper the bike, the heavier it is, because better materials are
lighterweight. In addition, cheaper bikes have plastic chain guards
instead of metal ones. Gears and pedals work more smoothly on
costlier bikes; the seat and handlebars are more easily adjusted.
And the service at a bike shop usually continues after the sale.
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't mean you shouldn't at least glance at the
superstore selections, says Stan Zukowski, Bicycling magazine
managing editor.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can find a better bike in a mass market than you used to
be able to,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   3. Get the right size.
</P>
<P>
   Don't buy a bike that's too big and expect your child to grow
into it; you're putting him or her in serious danger in the
meantime.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike adult-size bikes, which are grouped by frame size,
children's bicycles are measured by wheel size. Here are your
options:
</P>
<P>
   12-inch wheel: best for ages 3 to 4 because they come with
training wheels.
</P>
<P>
   16-inch wheel: An in-between bike that's good for ages 4 to 5,
maybe even up to age 7.
</P>
<P>
   20-inch wheel, junior size: Offers a 20-inch wheel with a
smaller frame, so the bike is easier to handle. This is designed
for a 6- or 7-year-old child who isn't quite ready for a full-size
20-inch bike. Has coaster brakes for kids who might not be able to
use hand brakes yet.
</P>
<P>
   20-inch wheel: The full-size 20-inch can be appropriate for kids
as young as 7, but often kids ride them well into their teens.
</P>
<P>
   Have your child try on the bike. It's the right size if she can
sit on the seat and put her feet on the ground with her legs just
slightly bent. A bike is too small when the seat and handlebars
have been extended to their limit and she still can't straighten
your legs while seated on the bike.
</P>
<P>
   4. Don't forget the helmet.
</P>
<P>
   Helmets aren't just a good idea to prevent head injuries; many
cities have ordinances requiring them.
</P>
<P>
   There are three big considerations for parents buying helmets:
fit, ventilation and safety approval.
</P>
<P>
   Fit: Most 8- to 10-year-old children can wear an adult size
small or medium helmet. But try it on and make sure you know how to
adjust the straps to fit. A helmet that's not adjusted right is
almost worthless. Beth Chalmers, manager of Bicycles Inc. in Fort
Worth, says helmet fit is so important that her store will adjust
helmets no matter where they were purchased.
</P>
<P>
   Ventilation: Lots of air holes are a must. Trapped heat near the
head is dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   Safety approval: Buy a helmet that has an approval sticker.
Currently there are several helmet safety-testing bodies, but
beginning in 2000 the Consumer Product Safety Commission will
examine and approve all helmets. Until the end of this year, look
for helmets approved by the American National Safety Institute
(ANSI), the Snell Memorial Foundation or the American Society for
Testing and Materials (ASTM).

   MUSIC-KIDDIE-POP (Undated) _ This season belongs to the
kiddie-pop brigades. Applause is passe; the reaction most eagerly
sought by pop culture right now, from music to television to
movies, is a high-pitched squeal from a mob of young girls. When
it's directed at males, that squeal signifies romantic fantasy
while it tests out some newly active hormonal responses. Directed
at females, it's a squeal of sisterly solidarity and fashion
approval. And for the last few years, its volume has been steadily
rising until it threatens to drown out anything with more mature
audiences in mind. Kiddie-pop has always been available to those
who wanted it, but in the late 1990s, it's turning into the only
game in town. By Jon Pareles.

   THEATER-HOLOCAUST (New York) _ Whenever central casting is
called on to fill the role of a Holocaust survivor, rarely does it
cast against type. Indeed, whether onstage or in films, the
Holocaust survivor is often reduced to a one-dimensional cliche, a
cartoon of a stock character that seems to dominate the perceptions
of those in the dramatic arts. Apparently, filmmakers and
playwrights like their Holocaust survivors tortured, tyrannical and
delusional _often all at the same time. But a current play suggests
an alternative depiction. By Thane Rosenbaum.

   FILM-FRANCE (Undated) _ In France, comedy is what we call `une
maladie du regard,' an outlook dooming you to see what is
ridiculous in life,'' said the writer-director Francis Veber. In
Veber's case, comedy has proved to be a malady worth having. In
France, he is like a one-man comedy industry: among the classic
hits that he has created are ``La Cage Aux Folles,'' ``Les
Comperes,'' and ``The Tall Blond Man With One Black Shoe.'' Veber's
most recent movie, ``The Dinner Game,'' (``Le Diner de Cons'')

it may be premature to declare the New York City Ballet's 50th
anniversary year at an end. The celebration continues through July
24 at the company's summer home, the Saratoga Performing Arts
Center in upstate New York. Nonetheless, the sum went beyond the

   MUSIC-OPERA (Undated) _ Since the dawn of recording, combining
two popular opera singers in an album has often proved a canny

Pavarotti and Sutherland, and Alagna and Gheorghiu, record buyers
have responded enthusiastically to the sparks that can ignite when
two musical artists with distinctive voices, personalities and

<P>
   MUSIC-FISCHER-DIESKAU (Undated) _ All superlatives for the
artistic impact and record-setting extensiveness of Dietrich
Fischer-Dieskau's singing career have long since been exhausted. It

   SCULPTURE-ITALY (Pistoia) _ Sculpture gardens bloom in many a
cultured field today. Museums consider them prestigious adjuncts,
cities invest in them as tourist attractions, philanthropists see
them as proof that art is long, life short and bronze a kind of
immortality. In Italy today, the past takes precedence, and
Italians show almost no interest in gardens planted with the work
of living artists. One rare exception is the home of Giuliano Gori,
an industrialist who has created a lovely and uncommon blend of
19th-century Romantic garden and art of the last 20 years at the
Fattoria di Celle, his villa and farm near Pistoia, in Tuscany. By

lighting that suggests candlelight, the 112 pieces of silver in

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYRACUSE, N.Y. _ Hillary Rodham Clinton completed her first
campaign tour across New York on Friday with an embrace of the
state's dairy farmers, declaring her support for federal
legislation that would assure them higher prices but likely force
up the price of milk for consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Although Mrs. Clinton again presented herself as a New
Yorker-in-training, eager to be educated in a series of forums with
voters in the state, she had no problem offering a position on the
milk price cartel, one of the most difficult issues in New York
state politics today.
</P>
<P>
   When the director of the Oneida County Farm Bureau, Pat Van
Lieshout, asked if New York should be permitted to join the
two-year-old federally sanctioned cartel that sets a minimum price
for milk paid to its member farmers, the first lady instantly
answered yes, in a clear sign of the preparation she has done for
her possible Senate campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In declaring her position, Mrs. Clinton appeared to put herself
at odds with Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, her likely Republican opponent
in next year's Senate race, who has sought to prevent New York's
inclusion in the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact.
</P>
<P>
   And she risked alienating downstate voters more concerned with
supermarket prices than the plight of farmers. She also, for the
third time in two weeks, appeared to deviate from a policy promoted
by her husband's administration, in this case, the Department of
Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me say that I support the dairy compact,'' Mrs. Clinton
said at a forum in Utica on Friday morning. ``And I support the
inclusion of New York, Pennsylvania, and I think it's, from what I
know now, a very important step for the dairy farmers, and, I would
argue, over the long run for the entire population to have more
price stability and more fair returns on investments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anyone works harder than dairy farmers,'' Mrs.
Clinton added. ``Dairy farmers are on call basically 24 hours a
day.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton disclosed her position at the fourth of her
``Listening to New Yorkers'' sessions, the centerpiece of this
campaignlike swing, in which groups of people have been invited to
sit down with Mrs. Clinton in orchestrated discussions.
</P>
<P>
   Friday Mrs. Clinton continued to go to considerable lengths to
present herself as a political ingenue, as she invited lessons from
health care workers, teachers, nursing home residents, farmers and,
at a Syracuse auto plant, factory workers. ``Thank you for
explaining this to me!'' she told a farmer in Utica Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a great idea!'' she told a job trainer in Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, her willingness to engage in a spontaneous exchange
with a dairy farmer on the compact issue suggested more depth to
Mrs. Clinton's knowledge about New York state than might otherwise
be suggested by the forums she has organized.
</P>
<P>
   It also was one more sign of her evolution into a full-fledged
New York political candidate. Throughout this week, Mrs. Clinton _
or Hillary, as she was addressed more than once by New York voters
_ offered clear hints that she had done her New York homework,
whether it was in addressing New York reporters by their first
names or mentioning obscure statistics about the state.
</P>
<P>
   At one point Friday she said, ``If upstate New York were a
separate state, it would rank 49th in job creation, compared to all
of the other states in the entire country.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton had originally considered staying in New York for
more events in Albany on Saturday, but now plans to return to
Washington on Saturday morning. She is to return to New York on
Monday, for three or four days of visits in the New York suburbs,
the part of the state where the Senate election could well end up
being determined.
</P>
<P>
   The Northeast compact is scheduled to expire on Oct. 1. The
legislation before Congress would renew it and enable New York, New
Jersey, Delaware, Maryland and Pennsylvania to join the cartel.
</P>
<P>
   The dairy compact issue is one that has long roiled this
economically depressed part of New York. It has tended to divide
politicians more by region than by party; both of New York's
Democratic senators, Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Charles Schumer,
support allowing the state to enter the organization.
</P>
<P>
   But many downstate leaders, from Giuliani to Mark Green, the New
York public advocate, have argued against it, warning that it could
raise the cost of a gallon of milk in New York City from about
$2.75 to $3.25.

 By BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a lengthy investigation of the New York City
Police Department, federal prosecutors have amassed evidence of
systemwide problems in the department's handling of police
brutality complaints, and are pressing the Giuliani administration
to undertake reforms, officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   If the city does not agree to changes sought by the U.S.
attorney in Brooklyn, Zachary Carter, the Justice Department could
sue the city, seeking a court-ordered overhaul and possible
oversight by a federal monitor.
</P>
<P>
   Carter, who opened his investigation after the August 1997
torture of Abner Louima by two officers in a Brooklyn station
house, is now in secret talks with top Giuliani administration
officials over a possible settlement, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   One hurdle is that Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, a staunch defender of
the Police Department, has said he would be unwilling to accept the
imposition of a federal monitor or other outside oversight of the
department, which is by far the largest in the country with 39,000
officers.
</P>
<P>
   Carter's precise findings were not known Friday, but the Justice
Department has said that he has examined whether incidents of
excessive force by officers ``were the product of systemic
deficiencies in police operations, including possible failures in
intake and investigation, discipline and supervision.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics have charged that police officials do not aggressively
pursue allegations of brutality by officers, even in cases in which
outside investigators have found evidence to support the charges.
For example, Carter's office has looked at how the department
follows up cases referred by the Civilian Complaint Review Board,
which investigates allegations of police wrongdoing, and cases in
which the city has settled lawsuits charging officers with
brutality.
</P>
<P>
   Carter's investigation is one of at least 10 nationwide of
police and sheriff's departments by prosecutors looking for
patterns of brutality and other civil rights violations. The
actions reflect the Justice Department's use of a 1994 law that
grew out of the Rodney King beating in Los Angeles, which
authorizes federal prosecutors to seek changes in the operations of
local departments.

 &HT;    Absence of sprawl from Bush agenda may stunt fast pace
 &HT;    By Scott S. Greenberger
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   This is the first in an occasional series on presidential
campaign issues and Gov. George W. Bush's record.
</P>
<P>
   ROUND ROCK, Texas _ Chili's, Home Depot, Bank of America,
Macaroni Grill, Brake Check, Blockbuster _ that's one segment in
the nearly unbroken chain of restaurants, stores, subdivisions and
apartment complexes linking Austin to Round Rock. The strip is on
Interstate 35, but it could be almost anywhere in America.
</P>
<P>
   Planners and policy wonks warn that such ``urban sprawl'' is
gobbling up green space, clogging roads and homogenizing the
American landscape. But ``sprawl'' means different things to
different people.
</P>
<P>
   For Betty Riggs, an avowed hater of strip malls who works at
Kelley's Cleaners in Round Rock's historic downtown, it translates
into ``more traffic, more problems.'' But Carmen Gutierrez moved to
Round Rock from San Angelo so she could be nearer to such stores
and restaurants. Janet Bell, a ``stay-at-home mom'' who has found
her slice of suburban heaven in a Round Rock subdivision, can't
wait for La Frontera, a shopping and office development, to open
nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Sprawl is a complex issue that doesn't easily lend itself to
political pronouncements. Nevertheless, Vice President Al Gore
views I-35, and other strips like it, as a path to the White House
_ especially since his likely Republican opponent, Texas Gov.
George W. Bush, doesn't view it as an issue at all.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, the Democratic front-runner, is betting that development
and traffic issues _ traditionally the concern of cities and states
_ will resonate with an increasingly suburban electorate in a
national campaign. After nearly a decade of unprecedented
prosperity, he thinks that quality-of-life proposals to preserve
open space and shorten commutes will find a receptive audience.
</P>
<P>
   There is evidence to support his strategy: Last November, voters
across the country approved nearly 200 anti-sprawl initiatives.
Nearly half of the nation's governors _ most of them Republicans _
referred to sprawl in their inaugural or state of the state
speeches this year.
</P>
<P>
   Bush wasn't one of them. Austinites have been wringing their
hands over rapid growth for almost three decades, but sprawl hasn't
emerged as a statewide issue in Texas as it has in states such as
Georgia, Maryland and New Jersey. With no public clamor, Bush has
been virtually silent on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor's basic idea about sprawl is that it's being
driven by a desire for better education for kids. He thinks the
solution is doing something about inner-city schools,'' said Bush
campaign spokesman David Beckwith.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rather than try to engineer where people live and work, we
should help improve schools by introducing vouchers and choice,''
Beckwith added.
</P>
<P>
   Some Bush supporters wish he'd take a closer look at the sprawl
issue. Former Indianapolis Mayor Bill Hudnut, who now works for a
Washington-based nonprofit organization that studies land use, said
he wrote a letter to Bush urging him not to let Gore seize sprawl
for the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Vice President Gore is on the right track, and I
really feel strongly that it would be good if George W. would carve
out a position on the subject,'' Hudnut said. ``I think that it's
important for the Republican Party to be perceived as a party
that's concerned about quality of life, about livability issues and
about how we're going to grow as a country in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Moving against sprawl
</P>
<P>
   Hudnut said Bush thanked him for his input _ and declined to
comment on sprawl. In contrast, Gore plans to make ``livability'' a
centerpiece of his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sprawl that has developed around our cities has
transformed easy suburbs into lonely cul-de-sacs, so distant from
commercial centers that if a family wants an affordable house, a
commuting parent often gets home too late to read a bedtime
story,'' Gore said in May while serving as host at a ``National
Town Meeting for a Sustainable America.''
</P>
<P>
   Numerous studies illustrate the problem, Gore and other sprawl
critics say: Between 1983 and 1995, the distance of the average
American commute increased 36 percent, according to the U.S.
Department of Transportation, and time spent commuting went up 14
percent. The American Farmland Trust, an anti-sprawl advocacy
group, says that since 1970, development has consumed 30 million
acres of U.S. farm and ranch land _ a total area larger than
Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, local planning commissions and zoning boards, not
the White House, have dealt with development. But Gore believes the
federal government has contributed to sprawl by subsidizing car
travel and the extension of infrastructure to undeveloped areas,
and that Washington should take steps to curb it.
</P>
<P>
   Gore wants federal officials to encourage Smart Growth _ a term
Austin uses for its effort to direct growth away from
environmentally sensitive areas _ by spending more on mass transit
and offering tax breaks for denser development on vacant land in
central cities. He advocates federal money for cities and states to
buy land and preserve it as open space.
</P>
<P>
   Bush doesn't want ``centrally planned decisions on people's
lifestyles that override people's desires,'' Beckwith said. But
Gore insists that the federal government can help communities
manage growth without being a ``beauty commissar'' or ``national
zoning board.''
</P>
<P>
   Without federal help, anti-sprawl efforts are already gaining
steam in cities and states across the country. Last November, New
Jersey residents voted to spend $1 billion to preserve 1 million
acres _ half of the remaining open land in the state _ as open
space. In Georgia, the Legislature recently created a powerful
regional transportation agency and gave Gov. Roy Barnes
far-reaching authority to curb sprawl in the Atlanta area. In
Southern California, voters drew clear boundaries around several
rapidly growing cities between Santa Barbara and Los Angeles. From
now on, voters there will have to approve new subdivisions.
</P>
<P>
   In Austin, voters last year approved a $65 million bond issue to
purchase or prevent development on 15,000 acres in the Barton
Springs watershed. They also signed off on a $40 million bond issue
to buy and develop parks and greenbelts in East Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Not a hot Texas topic
</P>
<P>
   As is often the case, Austin is the exception to the rule in
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Sturzl, who heads the Texas Municipal League, is aware
that sprawl has become a ``hot topic'' nationwide, but he hasn't
heard much discussion about it in the Lone Star State. Because
Texas is so big, its cities have always been geographically large
compared to those with similar populations in smaller Eastern
states, Sturzl said.
</P>
<P>
   ``How in the world can you keep population from expanding
geographically as it grows numerically? he asked. ``I don't think
Governor Bush has had any cause to even address that issue in
Texas.'' Many Texans simply don't view ``sprawl'' as a bad word,
according to state Sen. Jeff Wentworth (R-San Antonio), and they
are suspicious of government attempts to manage growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of latent Texas opposition to that sort of
planned land use. People want to have a little green space; they
want to have their own plot of ground; they don't want to build
vertically like they have in Chicago, New York, Philadelphia and
Boston,'' Wentworth said.
</P>
<P>
   ``As population increases, we're going to have what they call
'urban sprawl,' and what people actually involved in it call
'homeownership.'''
</P>
<P>
   Without a public cry in Texas for anti-sprawl measures, Bush's
record on the issue is limited. He has signed several bills
designed to promote regional planning, including a comprehensive
water bill and legislation written by Wentworth that gives counties
additional regulatory authority.
</P>
<P>
   But he's also signed measures limiting the power of Texas and
its cities to regulate development. Bush's staff helped draft a
1995 ``takings'' bill that gave landowners the right to sue cities
and the state for regulatory actions that devalue their property by
more than 25 percent. Supporters describe the bill as a private
property rights measure, but critics say it makes it more difficult
for state and local officials to manage growth. Bush also approved
legislation allowing landowners to set up ``water-quality
protection zones'' to avoid Austin's development rules, and a bill
exempting some building projects from the city's Save Our Springs
law, which limits the density of development over the portion of
the Edwards Aquifer that feeds Barton Springs.
</P>
<P>
   Even though sprawl may not rank high on Texans' list of concerns
right now, some critics say Bush has failed to show leadership on
an issue that could be crucial to Texas in the 21st century.
Between 1982 and 1992, Texas lost 489,000 acres _ an area roughly
three-fourths the size of Travis County _ of ``prime and unique''
farmland, according to the American Farmland Trust. That loss was
more than in any other state, and was 11.5 percent of the total
loss in the United States during that period, according to the
American Farmland Trust. Emil Moncivais, San Antonio's planning
director, said his city recently adopted a master plan in an effort
to avoid becoming ``one big megalopolis'' like Dallas-Fort Worth.
But he said the state has done little to promote the inner-city
development that can limit sprawl.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor hasn't said anything about it. He hasn't said we
need to take some kind of action, be proactive,'' Moncivais said.
``To tell you the truth, I think we need legislation at the state
level to give local people the ability to do what they want to do.
And that's not happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Ken Kramer, who heads the Texas chapter of the Sierra Club, said
leadership from the governor's office has been critical in states
trying to curb sprawl _ and that Bush hasn't shown any.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, he has no record on it,'' Kramer said. ``He's been
very much in the corner of those who have tried to restrict the
ability of various levels of government to affect land use. That's
just not in his vocabulary, to deal with the sprawl issues.''
</P>
<P>
   ``From a national perspective, Bush is definitely behind the
curve on this issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Sprawl's good side
</P>
<P>
   But will Bush's position on sprawl _ or lack of one _ hurt him
in the presidential campaign?
</P>
<P>
   Not with people like Janet Bell. She and her husband Roderick
began dating when they worked together at Dell Computer Corp. in
Austin, and they shared an apartment in the city before they were
married. But when it came time to raise a family, they headed
straight for the northern suburbs. They've got three kids, a
three-bedroom house they built in 1992 for $98,000, and a minivan
in the garage.
</P>
<P>
   New houses have sprung up all around the Bells since 1992, but
Bell said she doesn't mind Round Rock's rapid growth _ and she
plans to vote for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's great,'' she said, pausing to wipe tomato sauce
from her daughter's face. ``There's more to do. It increases our
property value. All the shopping centers and everything _ we're
excited about the La Frontera.''
</P>
<P>
   Builders note that growth is inevitable in a time of economic
prosperity. They point out that new households are being created at
a rate of 1.3 million a year, and that people are migrating to
areas where they can own a home and find work. Increasingly, those
places are in the suburbs: Some studies indicate that three out of
every four new jobs are being created in so-called ``edge cities''
located on the outskirts of major cities.
</P>
<P>
   Most importantly, they say, the American dream for many people
still consists of a home with a back yard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people still look to the American dream as being a
single-family home on a decent-sized lot with a back yard and a
sidewalk out front, not living in compact development,
high-density, or up rather than out,'' said Ohio builder Charlie
Ruma, who heads the National Association of Home Builders.
</P>
<P>
   Williamson County Rep. Mike Krusee, who comes from one of the
fastest-growing counties in the country, said Gore's anti-sprawl
talk may alienate people like his constituents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Williamson County is suburban sprawl. To say you want to stop
it is to say you don't want there to be future growth or prosperity
in Williamson County,'' Krusee said. ``Growth presents some
challenges,'' Krusee said. ``Nongrowth presents even bigger
problems. Nongrowth presents poverty.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore insists that his goal isn't to stop growth or stamp out
suburbs, but to make them more ``livable'' by preserving green
space and relieving traffic congestion. Supporting mass transit and
denser inner-city development would give people additional choices,
not mandate a certain lifestyle, he argues.
</P>
<P>
   Joel Garreau, author of the seminal sprawl book ``Edge City,''
believes Gore has hit on an issue with ``political juice'' _
although it presents risks for both parties. It's difficult for
Republicans to criticize development that is being driven by the
free market, Garreau said. Democrats need to be careful not to fall
into traditional liberal criticisms of the suburban lifestyle _
especially since about half of Americans now live in the suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   But Garreau believes people will respond to the right message.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got a situation where you have unprecedented economic
success, and something is still dreadfully wrong, something is
still missing, and people will respond to someone who says he can
fill that void in their lives,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Garreau argues that sprawl is like pornography _ it's hard to
define, but people know it when they see it. And most people, he
says, don't like it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever it is they think they once had, they no longer think
they have it: identity, community, civilization, soul.''
</P>
<P>
   Betty Riggs, who has lived in Georgetown for all of her 58 years
and worked at Kelley's Cleaners in downtown Round Rock for the past
19 of them, is the sort of person Gore is trying to reach. It used
to take her 10 minutes to get from Georgetown to Round Rock in the
morning _ now it takes up to 40. She hates the anonymity of the
chain stores at strip malls, preferring the small-town feel of
places like Kelley's.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time they say that your taxes are going to go down
because you're going to get this industry or Sun City, they don't.
All you get is more traffic, more problems,'' Riggs said. ``I know
things have to grow, but you get tired after a while.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a dingy warren of cables and wires in New York City, phone
calls are starting to look a lot like pork bellies.
</P>
<P>
   There, in his cramped office above the Pulse Night Club, Alex
Mashinsky, 33, has created an electronic trading floor for
telephone service that resembles nothing so much as the
international market for traditional commodities.
</P>
<P>
   Communications carriers from around the world, including giants
like AT&AMP;T and Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, link to the Web site
for Mashinsky's company, Arbinet Communications, to trade unused
long-distance telephone minutes from New York to every corner of
the globe. On Friday, a minute to Israel sold for as little as 8.4
cents, while a minute to Hong Kong cost as little as 4.6 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Although it is tempting to hold up Arbinet as a creator of a new
communications landscape, in fact it is only a stark symptom of a
much larger shift in the electronic world: While consumers and
regulators focus on the communications bottleneck in the so-called
last mile of wire to homes and businesses, long-distance
communications capacity _ or ``bandwidth,'' one of the hot
buzzwords of the Information Moment _ is fast becoming a commodity.
</P>
<P>
   Deregulation, rapid advances in optical technology and generous
capital markets have combined to create an explosion in
communications supply _ a supply that exceeds even the surging
demands in communications unleashed by the Internet. Accordingly,
long-distance prices are falling sharply. On Friday, AT&AMP;T sold its
biggest business customers a minute of telephone time to Israel for
35.4 cents, less than a third of the cost three years ago, and a
minute to Hong Kong for 27.2 cents, down 57 percent. The big gap
between the retail marketplace and spot markets like Arbinet's
cannot last for long.
</P>
<P>
   More significantly, for the companies and investors alike,
margins in some parts of the communications business are following
suit, as long-distance bandwidth for both telephone and data
services turns from scarce to plentiful.
</P>
<P>
   The shift is driving many of the strategy reversals and
multibillion-dollar deals that have become almost commonplace in
the industry. It explains AT&AMP;T's burst into the cable television
business and the continuing, soap-opera-like bidding war between
Qwest Communications International and Global Crossing for the
Frontier Corp. and U S West.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the fierce competition in the long-distance
arena only highlights its relative absence in local markets. That,
in turn, reinforces the almost overarching value of local
communications networks _ and is prompting some investors to
rethink their portfolios for the digital future. A New Profit
Formula
</P>
<P>
   The changes in the long-distance industry are undermining what
is perhaps the fundamental rule of telecommunications economics _
that margins stick to assets.
</P>
<P>
   After AT&AMP;T began to face significant competition about two
decades ago, it became clear that long-term profits in the business
stemmed largely from controlling physical assets like fiber optic
lines, copper wires and communications switches. For years, the
cost of running a network was a big part, perhaps a third or more,
of running a communications business. A major component of making
money was keeping the continuing network costs low, and the main
way to do so was to own the network.
</P>
<P>
   That is one reason Sprint emerged from a venture of the Southern
Pacific Railroad, which could use its railroad rights-of-way to lay
fiber-optic lines. It also explains MCI's original name, Microwave
Communications Inc.; by using microwave links it had developed, MCI
could provide long-distance services for less than AT&AMP;T. (MCI
eventually built its own fiber optic network, to help the company
compete more broadly.)
</P>
<P>
   Most of the hundreds of other new long-distance companies that
emerged after the 1984 breakup of AT&AMP;T, however, leased
communications capacity from others, and few have had consistent
profits and growth.
</P>
<P>
   Drawing from that experience, new companies like Qwest, Level 3
Communications, Global Crossing, IXC Communications and the
communications units of the Williams Companies and Enron, two
energy giants, have been founded _ and financed _ on the logic that
owning physical assets was essential. Each of the companies is
building a new fiber optic long-distance network, some in the
United States and some globally. Combined, the first three have
raised or borrowed more than $10 billion over the last three years,
mainly to build their new networks. At the same time, new optical
technologies have been expanding the capacity of existing networks
by factors of 16 and 32, with a potential of 160.
</P>
<P>
   To grasp just how much bandwidth is being created, consider
this: According to Telegeography Inc., a research firm in
Washington, in 1997 the world's public telephone networks carried
81.8 billion minutes, or 155,632 years, worth of international
phone calls. The newest optical systems can transmit the digital
equivalent of all of those calls over a single fiber in about 11
days.
</P>
<P>
   Hence the new carriers' predicament: Their investments are
alleviating the very scarcity that made their original business
plans so attractive.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is not that a glut of bandwidth has been created. It
is clear that new, bandwidth-hungry services will fill all of the
available communications pipes. However, the big profits in the
industry are migrating away from raw bandwidth and toward the
applications that use it.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   An early sign of how prices would turn volatile as bandwidth
supply played leapfrog with demand was in the market for T-3
Internet lines, which can carry 45 million bits of digital
information a second.
</P>
<P>
   When they first became widely available in 1995, the lines
sometimes cost less than $20,000 a month; buyers included corporate
customers and Internet service providers. But as the use of the
Internet exploded, demand outpaced supply, and prices shot as high
as $70,000 a month in early 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, however, prices have fallen consistently, by about
10 percent a year, as new and existing carriers have built up their
networks. T-3 lines now cost about $50,000 a month, and many in the
industry expect the trend to continue or even accelerate.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have been thinking about bandwidth from a Malthusian
standpoint: `How do I ration this?''' said Daniel Smith, chief
executive of Sycamore Networks, a communications equipment company,
whose previous business, Cascade Communications, another equipment
maker, was bought by Ascend Communications in 1997 for $3.7
billion. ``And now we're saying, `How do we think about this from a
standpoint of plenty?'''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the nation's communications carriers have come up with
an answer: They need to evolve up the digital food chain _ from
mere bandwidth suppliers to providers of advanced services _ to
maintain their profit margins in the future. They are scrambling to
acquire direct links to homes and offices _ not for the assets per
se, but because in the next century, margins in the communications
business will stick to services and customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anything, the cost of communications is falling faster than
the cost of computing, so assume unlimited bandwidth,'' said Howard
Anderson, managing director of the Yankee Group, a technology
consulting firm in Boston. In that case, he said, ``you are either
the application service innovator, or you're dead meat.''
</P>
<P>
   The shift has shred business plans across the industry and
helped fuel the paroxysm of takeovers reshaping the communications
landscape.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T provides a classic example. Many strategic subcurrents have
been at work behind AT&AMP;T's $90 billion leap into the cable TV
business, from a need to protect its long-distance base to the
simple desire to shake the company out of a torpor. But at the root
has been a quest for sustainable profits, and the brain trust at
AT&AMP;T's headquarters in Basking Ridge, N.J., decided that such
profits were not to be found merely in the long-distance business.
</P>
<P>
   Having a long-distance network is ``a necessary, but not
sufficient, condition to succeed in the future,'' said Frank Ianna,
president of AT&AMP;T's network unit. Instead, AT&AMP;T concluded that it
again needed to connect directly to its customers. ``That's where
there's the least amount of competition,'' he explained, referring
to local markets, ``and that's where you have the ability to
differentiate from your competition.''
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T is betting that owning cable lines directly into customers'
homes will allow it to deliver interactive television, high-speed
Internet services and local phone service _ all products that
should support higher margins than its core long-distance service.
</P>
<P>
   MCI Worldcom, the No. 2 long-distance provider, after AT&AMP;T, has
almost the same philosophy, but with a focus on serving business
customers. It, too, sees its future in services and applications,
not simply bandwidth. And it also wants to own the direct link to
the customer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our story is very different from offering raw capacity,'' said
John W. Sidgmore, vice chairman of MCI Worldcom.
</P>
<P>
   In Worldcom's evolution from communications nobody to industry
titan over the last decade, the company's deal to acquire MFS
Communications in 1996 looks at least as important strategically as
its acquisition of MCI last year. The MFS deal gave Worldcom not
only direct, local fiber optic links to business customers, but
also the Uunet Internet operation run by Sidgmore. Uunet, coupled
with MCI's corporate data communications operation, is now driving
MCI Worldcom's growth, by developing the advanced data
applications, like intranets, demanded by big business customers
and delivering them worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Since MCI and Worldcom announced their merger in the fall of
1997, telephone service revenue has dropped from 68 to 61 percent
of the combined company's overall sales, while Internet and
corporate data services have grown from 22 percent to 30 percent.
In the first quarter of 1999, telephone service revenue increased
only 7 percent over the comparable 1998 period, while data services
sales grew 30 percent and Internet revenue 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
   At Qwest, the shift in focus toward the top of the food chain
has happened in fast-forward, and some investors have found it
unsettling.
</P>
<P>
   When the company first offered shares to the public in 1997, it
was seen on Wall Street as a bandwidth play. Investors expected
Qwest to concentrate on using the latest technology to build a
long-distance network with more, and cheaper, capacity than those
of companies like AT&AMP;T or MCI, letting the upstart take market
share away from slower, less-advanced competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last year, though, Qwest has repositioned itself as _
surprise! _ a provider of advanced communications services for end
users. This year alone, Qwest has announced partnerships with
companies including KPMG, BellSouth, Siebel Systems, SAP America,
Hewlett-Packard, Oracle and Automatic Data Processing's Brokerage
Services unit to develop high-margin applications like software for
sales forces, aimed at various market segments//cut for space.
</P>
<P>
   And now, Qwest is making an unsolicited run at acquiring
Frontier, a long-distance company that also owns Globalcenter, one
of the biggest Web-hosting concerns, and U S West, the regional
Bell company based in Denver. U S West is the slowest-growing Bell,
but it still has millions of customers, whom Qwest needs for the
new services it is developing.
</P>
<P>
   Qwest is trying to wrench Frontier and U S West from the grasp
of another erstwhile bandwidth play, Global Crossing. While both
Qwest and Global Crossing have made cases for why their deals make
sense, their sudden transformations have left some investors
scratching their heads.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's created confusion,'' said Eric Strumingher, an analyst at
Paine Webber. ``Qwest and Global Crossing have represented
themselves as growth companies, as nimble companies based on modern
technology and that had the most flexibility. Now they're
attempting to combine with a company that was not representing
itself like that, and is in fact not like that. That is the big
source of the indigestion.''
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   To James Q. Crowe, perhaps the most prominent executive still
carrying the flag for the pure bandwidth strategy, this is all
tantamount to heresy.
</P>
<P>
   Crowe is chief executive of Level 3, which is building a
national fiber optic communications network based on Internet
systems and the latest optical technology. Crowe says he has no
intention of selling advanced services to consumers. He says that
through shrewd investments, he can sustain a technical advantage
over his competitors. That, in turn, would let Level 3 sustain a
cost advantage, enabling the company to persist as a wholesaler of
long-distance bandwidth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I can drop prices faster than anyone else can keep up
with and have margins that are sustainable,'' Crowe said. ``If you
can get a six- or nine-month technical advantage over your
competition, you can have a long, long, long life.''
</P>
<P>
   The stock market has hardly abandoned Crowe's world view _
shares of Level 3 are up 56 percent this year _ but others in the
industry say he is ignoring the commoditization of bandwidth at
considerable peril.
</P>
<P>
   ``I respect Jim and I've worked with Jim, but I think he's
absolutely, completely dead wrong,'' Sidgmore said. ``It really is
black and white. The fact of the matter is that if you just stand
back and think about it, Jim is not going to invent any new
technology. It's coming from Lucent or Cisco. And do you think
they're going to give anyone an exclusive? If you wanted to give
someone an exclusive, it would be the company that could buy the
most product; it would be MCI Worldcom or AT&AMP;T.''
</P>
<P>
   But Level 3 is different from those companies _ if not from
Qwest or Global Crossing, in their original guises _ because it has
no existing customer or revenue base to protect. That, Crowe says,
will keep his company more focused.
</P>
<P>
   ``History tells us that when you get bigger and bigger and more
and more vertically integrated, you break businesses apart,'' Crowe
said. ``That's like starting a computer company in 1980 and saying
the model is IBM.'' Integration is also the exact opposite of
government policy and market activity in, for example, the power
business, which is splitting into distinct segments that generate
electricity, transport it over long distances and then deliver it
to users.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, some communications experts think that consumers will
suffer as carriers seek vertical integration _ offering advanced
services as well as raw communications pipelines _ to fight off the
margin-eroding tides of commodity pricing.
</P>
<P>
   ``As someone on the buying end of it, rather than the selling
end of it, I'd like the companies that provide bandwidth to do a
really good job of that rather than do what the local telcos have
done, which is bring services into their networks,'' said Robert M.
Metcalfe, one of the founders of the 3Com Corp., the big data
networking company.
</P>
<P>
   Metcalfe, now an industry consultant, contends that the Bell
companies, which dominate local communications, have done a poor
job of making advanced services available to consumers, even as
they try to fend off competition.
</P>
<P>
   For investors, it may not really matter who is right. Even some
people who own or recommend the stocks of companies like Level 3
acknowledge that the pure bandwidth strategy may not endure for the
long term _ but add that many such companies will probably be
acquired in the next few years anyway, perhaps as foreign carriers
expand into the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some professional investors are shifting their focus to
the remaining points of scarcity in the communications business _
local assets and expertise in advanced services, especially on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   That is why Michael J. Mahoney, director of telecommunications
investment at Dresdner RCM Global Investors, likes MCI Worldcom but
is also becoming more bullish about local communications companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a decent position on the local side,'' he said, ``and
if anything, we're steadily growing in our affection for the local
side.'' Mahoney particularly likes GTE, which is trying to merge
with Bell Atlantic, and SBC, which appears close to completing its
deal to buy Ameritech.
</P>
<P>
   Mashinsky of Arbinet, the communications exchange in New York
City, watches the new world of long-distance evolve every day on
his computer screen. To him, the shift is clear. The future is not
in electronic pork bellies; it is in the fiber optic equivalent of
processed meats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the last three years, $402 billion was invested in
telecom worldwide, and a lot of that went into infrastructure,'' he
said. But many of the entrepreneurs ``have not been able to fill up
their networks, because there are too many people building
networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``So a lot of these guys are refocusing,'' Mashinsky added,
``and saying that if we want to retain our margins, we have to get
a hold of some customers and add some value.''

INDEXES END ON HIGH NOTE FOR A 2ND CONSECUTIVE FRIDAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For the second consecutive Friday, the stock market
finished the week with a hat trick, as all the three major indexes
reached new highs. Bond prices ended slightly lower as Ford Motor
Co. completed the biggest corporate bond issue ever.
</P>
<P>
   Ford, and its finance company, Ford Motor Credit, sold $8.6
billion in bonds, including $1.8 billion of 32-year bonds that were
priced to yield 7.529 percent, or 1.4 percentage points over the
yield on the government's 30-year bond. In a reflection of the
recent strong demand for these and other corporate bonds, which
offer higher yields than the Treasury market, government bond
prices managed to remain relatively stable ahead of and during the
record sale.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average finished the day at 11,193.70,
up 66.81 points, or six-tenths of one percent. The Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500-stock index rose 8.86 points, or six-tenths of a
percent, to 1,403.28. The Nasdaq composite index climbed 21.21
points, or eight-tenths of a percent, to 2,771.86.
</P>
<P>
   For the week, the Dow was up half a percent, hitting two new
highs. The S&AMP;P 500 rose nine-tenths of one percent, hitting two new
highs, while the Nasdaq index was up 1.9 percent, setting three new
highs.
</P>
<P>
   In the bond market, the price of the 30-year Treasury bond was
down 5/32, to 89 22/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite
direction, rose to 6 percent from 5.99 percent Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The yield on the 30-year bond bounced around all day. It popped
over 6 percent as some dealers apparently were selling as a way to
hedge against losses if the Ford bond sale prompted a sell-off in
the Treasury market. It dropped below 6 percent as traders decided
that the Ford deal was going well. But then it inched back to 6

   Both stock and bond investors will be keeping a close eye on the
barometers of economic growth and inflation that the government
will release next week. Any hint of rising inflation _ which is not
expected _ or acceleration in the pace of economic growth could
send stocks lower and interest rates higher.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday will bring the report on producer prices, which could
give some signal if the recent rise in industrial commodity prices
is affecting prices. The government's overall retail sales report
for June will also be released Wednesday. Sales in retail stores
rose sharply last month.
</P>
<P>
   The Consumer Price Index for June comes on Thursday and
industrial production figures follow on Friday. The University of
Michigan survey on consumer sentiment will also be released Friday.

   Speaking about the lackluster day in the bond market, Thomas
Connor, the head government trader at J.P. Morgan Securities, said,
``The bond market wasn't going to get up and go because we want to
see the CPI number next week.''
</P>
<P>
   Equity investors will also begin concentrating on corporate
earnings reports as the second-quarter reporting season gears up.
It is the optimism about the outlook for earnings growth the rest
of the year that is helping bolster stocks in the face of the
quarter-point interest rate increase by the Federal Reserve at the
end of last month and the possibility of another later in the year.
</P>
<P>
   The two main compilers of corporate earnings forecasts are
predicting a double-digit increase in the profits for the 500
companies in the Standard &AMP; Poor's stock index. First Call Corp.'s
forecast is an increase of 11.2 percent, compared with the second
quarter of 1998. IBES International's prediction is 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Since Fed policy-makers raised their short-term interest rate
target to 5 percent on June 30, investors have been debating
whether another rate increase will be necessary to curb economic
growth and keep inflation in check.
</P>
<P>
   The yield on the two-year Treasury note, which is sensitive to
Fed rate moves, finished Friday at 5.58 percent.

 &HT;    Rare birds, these rookies, going to Super Bowl team
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When rookie Patrick Kerney reported to Falcons
mini-camp this week, he was greeted by teammates with open arms. Or
make that open palms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the guys were asking me for a loan,'' Kerney, the
team's first-round draft choice, said with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   The defensive end from Virginia was one of 15 rookies _ nine
draft choices and six free agents _ to take part in the three-day
mandatory camp, which ended Friday. Although not much can be judged
from noncontact drills, Atlanta coach Dan Reeves spoke favorably of
his first-year players.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overall, I think they are doing a really good job of fitting
in, working hard and trying to get ready to come in and compete,''
Reeves said. ``That's what (the rookies) have to do, and we still
got a couple of weeks left to work with them before (training)
camp.''
</P>
<P>
   All rookies have to adjust in moving from college to the pros.
The transition of going to the defending NFC champions is more
intense.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest, playing with a team that was in the Super Bowl
last year is a dream come true,'' said tight end Reggie Kelly, a
second-round pick from Mississippi State.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watched all these guys when I was in high school and
college, and now I'm actually up here playing with and against
them,'' Kelly said. ``It's a privilege and blessing ... I'm going
to accept the challenge and do what I can to contribute.''
</P>
<P>
   Receiver Rondel Menendez, a seventh-rounder from Eastern
Kentucky, said he was nervous when he began working out with the
Falcons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in awe at first, just from the fact I was with a team
that was in the Super Bowl last year,'' Menendez said. ``It was a
big surprise for me, especially since I came from such a small
school. The competition is so much greater up here. It has been an
eye-opening experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerney was surprised when he put on his practice jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's weird to see yourself in a new uniform,'' he said. ``I
was so used to wearing the Virginia colors the past four years. I
am a bit in awe when I think about where I started at (as a college
walk-on) and where I am now.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerney and Kelly wasted little time impressing the veteran
players. Kerney is expected to add depth to one of the NFC's best
defensive lines. Kelly is an acclaimed blocker who will allow the
Falcons to employ more two-tight-end sets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pat hustles to every ball with great effort,'' second-year
linebacker Keith Brooking said. ``That's what you need on defense _
to have 11 guys go all out.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the young tight end (Kelly),'' veteran linebacker
Jessie Tuggle said. ``This kid is already running routes like a
veteran. But again, it's hard to tell how good or bad anyone is
until they put on the pads.''
</P>
<P>
   As the Falcons trotted off the field after the last mini-camp
practice, it was hard to tell the veterans from rookies. Most of
the rookies still have a full head of hair, but that might not be
the case later this month when training camp begins.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to save everything for the right time,'' Tuggle said
with a sneaky smile. ``It's all about timing, and it's too early
right now. We'll wait until training camp to actually pull out the
rookie tricks. But they got some things in store for them, for
sure.

$4.9 BILLION JURY VERDICT IN GM FUEL TANK CASE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ariz., Fla.)  (rk) 
 By ANDREW POLLACK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In what is believed to be the largest award ever
in a personal-injury lawsuit, General Motors Corp. was ordered
Friday to pay $4.9 billion to six people severely burned when the
fuel tank of their 1979 Chevrolet Malibu exploded after a rear-end
collision.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict was reached by a 12-person jury in state court here
after a 10-week trial in which the accident victims had produced
some evidence purporting to show that General Motors had known the
car's design was unsafe but had not changed it because of the cost.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict, which included $107.6 million in compensatory
damages and $4.8 billion in punitive damages, is likely to raise
questions once again about whether jury verdicts in personal-injury
and product-liability cases have got out of hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an enormous, incredible windfall to whoever gets it,''
said Gary Keating, a law professor at the University of Southern
California, who said he could not recall another award of that
size. ``It turns the court system into a lottery.''
</P>
<P>
   But Keating, who said he is not a big critic of current court
procedures, said it was highly likely the verdict would be reduced
on appeal or that the parties would settle for a lesser amount. ``I
think it's true that the chance of this verdict surviving is almost
nonexistent,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But if the verdict were to stand, it would be a significant
burden for GM, which reported earnings of $3 billion from
continuing operations in 1998. Panish, the lawyer for the
plaintiffs, said there are 30 to 60 other lawsuits involving
fuel-tank fires of the Malibu and other General Motors so-called
A-body cars, including the Pontiac Grand Am, the Oldsmobile Cutlass
and the Chevrolet Monte Carlo, which have a similar fuel-tank
design. Last year, a jury in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., awarded a
family $60 million after an accident in which the fuel tank of a
Cutlass exploded, killing two people and burning four others.
 &UR;  &LR; Patricia Anderson, her four children and a family friend, Jo
Tigner, were driving home from church in Los Angeles on Christmas
Eve in 1993 when she slowed to stop at a red light and a drunken
driver plowed into their car from behind at what the plaintiffs'
lawyers said was 50 miles per hour and General Motors says was 70
miles per hour. The people in the Malibu suffered severe burns.
Mrs. Anderson's daughter Alisha Parker, now 11, was horribly
disfigured on her face and lost her right hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``The jurors wanted to send a message to General Motors that
human life is more important than profits,'' Brian J. Panish, the
lawyers for the accident victims, said.
</P>
<P>
   Panish said that the gas tank on the 1979 Malibu was only 11
inches from the rear bumper while in some prior year models it had
been more than 20 inches away. He said the testimony presented
during the trial showed that it would have cost General Motors
$8.59 per vehicle for a safer design but that the company had
decided it would be cheaper to settle any lawsuits that arose.
</P>
<P>
   One key piece of evidence, he said, was a memo written by an
Oldsmobile engineer named Edward Ivey in 1973 in which he estimated
that fuel tank fires were costing General Motors only $2.40 per
vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   General Motors, in a statement, maintained that the car's fuel
tank was safe and met or exceeded federal standards. ``This
extremely severe crash was caused by a single factor _ drunken
driving,'' the company said. It said it would appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Richard W. Shapiro, a Phoenix attorney who represented the
automaker, said the verdict was ``shocking'' and noted that the
jury had not been allowed to hear evidence that the driver of the
other car was drunk and went to jail. He also said the company had
been barred by the judge. Ernest G. Williams of Los Angeles County
Superior Court, from presenting evidence showing the safety history
of the vehicle and also from presenting crash-test data showing
that the car's design was safer than the one the plaintiffs
advocated.
</P>
<P>
   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has conducted
two safety investigations into the Malibu since the 1970s but
neither involved the fuel system, said Timothy Hurd, a spokesman
for the agency. He said the agency had recently notified automakers
that it was reviewing whether to tighten its rules on protecting
fuel systems but that this was unrelated to the Los Angeles case.
</P>
<P>
   But Joan B. Claybrook, who was the administrator of the highway
safety administration during the Carter administration, said Friday
that big verdicts in personal injury lawsuits were sometimes the
first signal to regulators that a safety problem existed. ``Could
this car be a problem and NHTSA. not know about it?'' asked Ms.
Claybrook, who is now president of Public Citizen, a consumer
advocacy group. ``Absolutely.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ms. Claybrook said she first learned of problems with Ford
Pinto's gas tank and ordered a federal investigation after a $125
million personal injury verdict in 1977. That award, and another
big one involving the Pinto fuel tank, was subsequently reduced
substantially. But the Pinto was later recalled because of the fuel
tank problem.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Hoar, an adviser to plaintiffs' lawyers in many lawsuits
against auto companies, including this case, said the verdict was
the largest ever in a personal injury case. He said the plaintiffs
might have been particularly successful because they presented
evidence that General Motors had lobbied in the early 1970s against
tougher standards for protecting fuel systems in crashes.
</P>
<P>
   Other lawyers said that the size and wealth of General Motors,
the nation's largest company, were taken into account by the jurors
in deciding on the size of the punitive damages.
</P>
<P>
   Jurors told reporters that that they felt the company had valued
human life too lightly. ``We're just like numbers I feel to them,
statistics,'' one juror, Carl Vangelisti, told Reuters. ``That's
something that is wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Anderson, the plaintiff said, ``I'm just glad that justice
was done.'' She said she was relieved, too, that the court decided
that General Motors was at fault. ``I have always blamed myself for
this,'' she said ``I couldn't give my children an explanation'' for
what happened to them.

SAUDI'S VISIT TO ARMS SITE IN PAKISTAN WORRIES U.S. 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By JANE PERLEZ    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Two months ago, Saudi Arabia's defense minister,
Prince Sultan bin Abdelaziz al-Saud, made an unusual visit to the
Pakistani nuclear and missile facilities near Islamabad, causing
alarm in the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   The visit was considered ``definitely eyebrow-arching,'' one
senior administration official said. It was the first time known
that an outsider had visited the top-secret sites.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the administration's fears, officials said, was a lack
of clarity by Saudi Arabia when Washington asked why the minister
had visited the plants, one for uranium enrichment at Kahuta and
one for missiles at Ghauri.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Saudis haven't told us the purpose of the visits,'' said
one official, ``and the Pakistanis have discounted them.''
</P>
<P>
   Another official said that when the administration pressed the
Saudis, the government ``obfuscated.''
</P>
<P>
   The administration has repeatedly warned Pakistan not to export
its weapons technology, some of which comes from North Korea. A
senior administration official suggested that President Clinton had
again warned Pakistan about such proliferation when he met here
last weekend with Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif about the Kashmir
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The administration is especially concerned about proliferation
in the Middle East, and the tour by Prince Sultan, a brother of the
king and the major decision maker in Saudi arms purchases, raised
this concern to a new level.
</P>
<P>
   Iran is developing nuclear weapons, and Iraq no longer accepts
international arms inspections. The tour by the Saudis is seen as a
reflection of their feeling that they need to protect themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not looking at a Saudi event, but at a sea change in
the gulf,'' said Anthony Cordesman, a Middle East expert at the
Center for Strategic and International Studies.
</P>
<P>
   Unease about the visit was particularly acute because Saudi
Arabia covertly acquired intercontinental ballistic missiles from
China 10 years ago, but Saudi Arabia has expressed interest in
replacing them, military specialists said.
</P>
<P>
   A British analyst with Jane's Rocket and Missile Newsletter,
Paul Beaver, said it appeared that Saudi Arabia wanted to buy a new
generation of missiles being tested by Pakistan, which have a range
of 1,500 miles. Such a missile could reach the main cities in Iraq
and Iran, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said they believed that Prince Sultan
was most interested in acquiring missiles, not nuclear weapons
technology. A senior administration official said Washington had
received ``assurances from Saudi officials that they are not
seeking weapons of mass destruction,'' or nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   After Pakistan exploded its first nuclear weapon, in May 1998,
Saudi Arabia heralded the country for becoming ``the first Muslim
country to be a nuclear power.''
</P>
<P>
   Both the Pakistani and the Saudi press gave glowing reports of
the prince's visits. He was accompanied by Sharif and the scientist
who developed the Pakistani nuclear bomb, A.Q. Khan, according to
the Pakistani press.
</P>
<P>
   The Pakistani newspapers suggested that Saudi Arabia was helping
to finance weapons production, but did not speculate on purchases.
</P>
<P>
   But Michael Krepon, president of the Henry L. Stimson Center,
which studies security issues, said he believed that the Saudis are
now interested in more than helping Pakistan with money. ``The
clear inference is that he's interested in the material at the
sites he visited,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   During his frequent visits to India and Pakistan since the two
countries exploded nuclear weapons, Deputy Secretary of State
Strobe Talbott has urged them to control weapons exports. So far no
such legislation has come into effect, administration officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   A British expert on Pakistan and the Middle East, Simon
Henderson, who is researching a book on Pakistan's missile and
nuclear developments, said the Saudi's visit showed that attempts
at stopping Pakistan from selling weapons were faltering.
</P>
<P>
   ``This visit reawakens fears that accepted standards of
nonproliferation behavior are not being adhered to,'' Henderson
said. ``The fears are that people making missiles are selling them
on to nonproliferating countries like Saudi Arabia, a major ally of
the United States.''

3 FORMER ADM EXECUTIVES ARE SENTENCED FOR PRICE FIXING  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By KURT EICHENWALD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Three former executives of Archer Daniels Midland Co.,
including the son of its former chairman, Dwayne Andreas, were
sentenced Friday to terms ranging from two to two and a half years
in prison for their roles in a worldwide scheme to fix prices of a
feed additive manufactured by the company.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Andreas, the former vice chairman and heir apparent at
the company, and Terrance Wilson, the retired head of its corn
processing division, were sentenced to two years and ordered to pay
the maximum fine of $350,000 each.
</P>
<P>
   A third former executive, Mark Whitacre, was sentenced to two
and a half years, but not ordered to pay a fine. Whitacre, who is
already serving nine years in prison for illegally taking millions
of dollars from Archer Daniels, was ordered to serve 20 months of
the new sentence on top of his current term.
</P>
<P>
   The sentences handed down by U.S. District Court Judge Blanche
Manning added a new twist to a series of events that has bedeviled
the case from the beginning: Whitacre, who received the longest
sentence, was also the government informant who alerted federal
investigators to the price-fixing conspiracy in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   In making her ruling, Manning determined that Whitacre was a
manager of the conspiracy, which under the federal guidelines for
sentencing would require an increase in his prison term. But she
ruled that neither Andreas nor Wilson _ who prosecutors contended
were the masterminds of the scheme _ had controlling roles. Manning
did not explain the reasons for her decision.
</P>
<P>
   The three men were convicted last September of conspiring with
Japanese and Korean competitors to fix the price of the feed
additive lysine, and to assign each company its production volume.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Andreas nor Wilson showed any reaction to the sentence.
Whitacre was sentenced by telephone. The men had faced maximum
sentences of three years in prison.

   Forced to Share The Inner-City Turf
</P>
<P>
   For the last several years, Richard Huber, the chief executive
of Aetna Inc., has been quietly trying to tap the business
potential of the nation's central cities, which have long been
neglected by big private insurance concerns like his. Aetna has
recruited African-American and Hispanic sales representatives to
canvass their inner-city neighborhoods for customers, not only for
managed-care plans but also for retirement accounts, another big
part of the company's portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton was so taken by Aetna's efforts that he
enlisted Huber as a traveling companion last week on a tour of some
of the nation's blighted urban and rural areas. Huber was honored,
but also a bit concerned that the new visibility of his efforts
would encourage other companies to compete on this virgin
territory. ``This is an attractive business opportunity, and I
don't want everyone to know about it,'' he said as Clinton met with
business leaders in the Mississippi Delta on Tuesday. ``He's
blowing my cover.''

<P>
   Few executives have mastered the art of living well as fully as
Marshall S. Cogan. But now Cogan, chairman of Foamex International
and a director and former chairman of United Auto Group, is
mastering the art of cutting back. Earlier this year, he sold his
Long Island home, in Southampton, for about $10.5 million. He is
also selling part of his modern art collection through Vivian
Horan, a New York dealer.
</P>
<P>
   Cogan, who is 62, won't give up the high life altogether. He has
been negotiating to buy another Long Island house _ John Scanlon's
sprawling historic home on Main Street in Sag Harbor, for an
estimated $2.3 million, according to a person close to the
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Cogan's privately held Trace International has had poorly
performing stakes in both United Auto Group, which operates auto
dealerships, and Foamex, a manufacturer of polyurethane. Cogan once
controlled the companies, but no more. If shareholders approve
Roger S. Penske's controlling investment in United Auto Group,
Cogan will receive $750,000 a year for agreeing not to compete.
</P>
<P>
   Scanlon, best known as a public relations executive, is now a
managing director at DSFX Inc., a private investigations firm.
Neither he nor Cogan returned calls seeking comment.

   `A Breather' From the Tycoons
</P>
<P>
   As the champagne and Oysters Rockefeller circulated at the
Museum of American Financial History in lower Manhattan on Thursday
evening, the financial historian Ron Chernow _ author of ``Titan:
The Life of John D. Rockefeller Sr.'' and guest curator for the
museum's new exhibit, ``Rockefeller Revisited'' _ confirmed that he
was at work on a new biography. But his subject may surprise his
Wall Street fans: Alexander Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
   Chernow, who has written tomes about the House of Morgan and the
Warburg family, said he had started a biography of Andrew Carnegie
but abandoned it after deciding that ``it was time to give the
moguls of the Gilded Age a breather.'' Besides, after wrestling to
bring so many tight-lipped tycoons to life, he said, it was
refreshing to have a subject ``who committed his every thought to
paper.''

THOME CARRIES CLEVELAND FANS' ACCOLADES INTO ALL-STAR GAME

<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ The honored-to-be-going platitudes tumble out in a
stream of consciousness, spoken in an accent that is equal parts
Midwestern twang and Southern drawl. The infielder with the body
built for baseball talks about childhood dreams. He clasps his
hands, places his thick forearms on his knees, and highlights the
support of family. Reminded of other invited stars, he gives
endless compliments to the company he will keep Tuesday night. He
mentions the fun and excitement surrounding midsummer classics.
</P>
<P>
   But even when Jim Thome's All-Star Game thoughts are collected
and sorted and stripped of their aw-shucks emphasis, you are still
left with one big ``Thank You'' note addressed to the fans. In a
city known for its devotion to baseball, the clean-cut Cleveland
first baseman is a fan favorite. And come All-Star time, that's
what counts.
</P>
<P>
   Thome will represent the American League for the third
consecutive time in his six-year career. His last two appearances
in the All-Star Game have been by popular demand. The 28-year-old
Thome, one of two AL nonpitchers with a batting average below .300
elected to start this year (along with DH Jose Canseco), received
an astounding 679,801 more votes than runner-up Rafael Palmeiro.
Thome can credit a large part of his success in the polls to the
people of Cuyahoga County. Despite Palmeiro's first-half
statistical superiority, fans saw something more deserving in
Thome's play.
</P>
<P>
   With his .278 batting average, 13 home runs, and 48 RBIs
(entering Friday night's game), Thome stands as the classic example
of indiscriminate fan voting. The popularity contest placed the
Cleveland star ahead of a more deserving player from Texas. There
was no doubt Palmeiro's .351 average, 20 home runs, and 73 RBIs
would earn him a spot as a reserve, and on Wednesday, AL manager
Joe Torre named him to the team.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Indians, Palmeiro didn't have the benefit of
record-setting attendance, zealous voters, or a first-half schedule
packed with home games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't answer every question the media's going to ask me
about why I'm there and why Palmeiro isn't (as a starter),'' said
Thome. ``It's life. That's the nature of the game and how things
work sometimes. I've said before that he's very deserving and
probably should start.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's obviously got the better numbers. But as a player we
can't control what the fans do. We can't control who they pick, why
they pick them. I think obviously there were enough people who
thought highly of me as a player to put me in there. Granted, you
have career years, you have average years, and some years you're
going to have below-average years. As a player, you have to realize
that there's going to be a lot of people who talk about your
perfomance, whether you do good or whether you do bad. You can't
get caught up in that.''
</P>
<P>
   The infielder also considers reputation and fan familiarity a
factor. He points toward the 17th straight All-Star appearance and
16th consecutive start for Cal Ripken. Thome claims consistency
over several seasons, rather than exceptional numbers over the
first-half of one season, earns more votes.
</P>
<P>
   Many fans know Thome continues to struggle with back problems
this season. Two pillow-sized ice bags after games leave no doubt
the injury affects his play, especially hitting. He believes fans
account for nagging injuries as well as season-long potential.
Thome contends that the 1,364,692 voters who punched out his name
factored in his role on a team boasting the best record in baseball
and the room for improvement in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   The All-Star first baseman has been a model of consistency for
Cleveland. Last season, he became the first lefthanded hitter in
franchise history to record 30 home runs in three straight seasons,
and he's only slightly behind the same pace in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   More than likely, Thome's postseason play keeps voters coming
back to his name. In 1998, he had team highs in home runs (6) and
RBIs (10) in 10 playoff games. The home run total tied a
single-season playoff record set by Len Dykstra, Ken Griffey Jr.,
and Bernie Williams.
</P>
<P>
   He set a standard with four home runs in the AL Championship
Series against eventual world champion New York. Two years ago, he
blasted two home runs in the World Series against Florida. The list
continues with his 1995 performance in Game 5 of the ALCS against
Seattle when Thome hit a two-run homer in the sixth that gave the
Tribe a win and a 3-2 series lead.
</P>
<P>
   The power comes from his broad-shouldered, 6-foot-4-inch,
225-pound frame. And a lot of hard work with hitting coach Charlie
Manuel, who has guided Thome through the Cleveland system, has
helped produce steady improvement and impressive results.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very coachable,'' said Manuel. ``He'll listen and, at the
same time, he's a real hard worker. He's very strong, but he had to
do a lot of work on his approach to the ball and his swing. His
dedication to the game and the fact that he loves to hit and all
the hard work together, that's why he's successful. Sometimes I
don't think he realizes the work he did when he was in the minor
leagues.''
</P>
<P>
   With his socks pulled high in honor of his grandfather, a stocky
build inherited from German-Irish ancestory, and a family of
baseball players from Peoria, Ill., behind him, Thome walks, talks,
and displays the work ethic of a throwback player. Even his mental
approach to the game could be considered old-fashioned.
</P>
<P>
   He believes the fans come first and players are paid to do
whatever is best for the team. He talks about the importance of
being cordial when signing autographs. He still remembers how
delighted he was when, at age 10, he snuck into the Cubs' clubhouse
and got Dave Kingman's autograph.
</P>
<P>
   After the acquisition of Matt Williams in 1997, the player
trained as a third baseman moved to first without any protest. With
regular third baseman Travis Fryman out until September with a torn
knee ligament, Thome has worked out at third over the past week and
may start there Saturday night against Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a starting first baseman on the All-Star team and he's
willing to make a move to third base for the good of the team,''
said manager Mike Hargrove. ``I think that says a lot about Jimmy's
talent to be able to do that. Second of all, it says a lot about
Jimmy's character. There's not enough good things you can say about
that. I don't know if there are many players who would do that
(switch).''
</P>
<P>
   Infield/first base coach Brian Graham also commends Thome's
``All-Star personality,'' the blend of working-class attitude and
respect for the game and his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up in the Midwest and I think it's very family-
oriented there,'' said Thome. ``You grow up and you're really close
to your family, and I think that really helped me out. My dad was a
blue-collar worker and he had to work very hard for what he's
gotten. I think that rubbed off on me.''
</P>
<P>
   When Thome first made it to the big leagues, his father wrote
``25 DBTH'' inside his baseball cap. It was a lasting message from
father to son, reminding the young player, ``Don't believe the
hype.'' Good or bad. Never let yourself get too high or too low.
</P>
<P>
   And when you're the AL's top choice to play first base in the
All-Star Game with more than one million voters lending support,
don't lose sight of all the little things that count.

   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ Two-thirds of the houses in villages
across a wide swath of Kosovo are uninhabitable because of war
damage, mainly burning by Serbs; most of the schools are severely
damaged or destroyed; much of the water is polluted, and a large
part of the agriculture is ruined, according to a U.N. survey
released this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopes that the humanitarian situation may not be as serious as
initially feared seem to be over-optimistic,'' said the report,
issued by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
</P>
<P>
   The grim assessment was based on reports on 141 of Kosovo's
roughly 2,000 villages by U.N. shelter and refugee experts,
nongovernmental organizations and NATO peacekeeping troops, all of
whom filled out standardized forms.
</P>
<P>
   Warning of a ``serious humanitarian threat,'' the U.N. report
said, ``Large pockets of peoples identified by this first sample
may be facing situations that could evolve into an emergency.'' The
report said that while preparing Kosovo's damaged homes for winter
is a fundamental objective, ``there is mounting evidence that basic
requirements still need to be provided'' to significant numbers of
people.
</P>
<P>
   Titled ``Rapid Village Assessment _ The First Cut,'' the report
is the first of a series of studies over the next four to six weeks
intended to plot the needs of Kosovo's people after the destruction
wrought by Serb forces and NATO bombs.
</P>
<P>
   The report cautioned that the statistical sample was too small
to accurately reflect all of Kosovo and noted that aid agencies
would make their first visits to areas where they perceived the
greatest need. But, the report said, the results suggested a
pattern that should be verified ``with all due diligence.''
</P>
<P>
   The report noted that 102 of the villages in the survey had also
been included in a survey of 650 villages conducted up to January
1999, after some initial fighting but before the Serb drive to
evict Albanians from Kosovo had emerged in full force.
</P>
<P>
   ``Comparing this data we find that these 102 assessed villages
now report a two-fold increase in severely damaged homes and a near
tripling of completely destroyed,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   All told, the village survey found that 64 percent of houses
assessed had been destroyed or severely damaged, and an additional
20 percent had sustained slight or moderate damage.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials noted in one of their periodic ``emergency
updates,'' issued Friday, that ``the level of destruction is
extremely varied.'' Some areas are barely touched, like the city of
Prizren, which was used as a collection point to push refugees
south to Albania, or the eastern area of Kosovo, where U.S. troops
are now stationed and which had a proportionately larger Serb
population and less activity by the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   Others, like villages in the Drenica region, the birthplace of
the KLA, and areas around Djakovica and Pec that were KLA
strongholds or supply routes, were devastated.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Although the report cautioned that there were no precise figures
of homes destroyed yet, it said initial estimates placed the number
of severely damaged and uninhabitable homes anywhere from a minimum
of 40,000 to 50,000 to a maximum of 90,000.
</P>
<P>
   The report added that unlike the first 12 months of the
conflict, the damage in recent months included urban areas in the
north and west. For example, the previously undamaged city of Pec
is estimated to have suffered a loss of between 40 percent and 45
percent of housing stock. Urban Djakovica and Mitrovica sustained
losses estimated at 30 percent, with new severe damage in
surrounding rural areas.
</P>
<P>
   Forty percent of the water in the villages surveyed was
determined to be of poor quality because it had been polluted by
``a range of materials, including human as well as animal
corpses.'' War crimes investigators have discovered a number of
incidents in which Albanians were killed and their bodies _
sometimes eight or nine at a time _ were thrown into wells and then
covered with rocks and dirt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only 12 percent of previously existing health facilities still
exist in those villages that were surveyed,'' the report said.
``And 60 percent of previously existing schools have been severely
damaged or destroyed.''
</P>
<P>
   Food could be an increasing problem as more people return.
``Food availability in villages has been dramatically reduced over
the past three months as shops were looted or destroyed and
agricultural production ground to a halt,'' the report said. It
added that wheat production was expected to be 50 percent lower
than normal, while the corn crop was estimated at 10 percent to 20
percent of its usual level. Livestock losses were estimated at 40
percent to 50 percent.

 &HT;    Banged-up Martin says he'll finish race behind wheel
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUDON, N.H. _ NASCAR driver Mark Martin, who underwent
arthroscopic knee surgery on Wednesday, completed both of his laps
in Friday's first-round qualifying for the Jiffy Lube 300.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, 40, had only the 29th-fastest qualifying speed at New
Hampshire International Speedway, failing to gain one of the first
25 starting spots for Sunday's race.
</P>
<P>
   If Martin doesn't have one of the top 36 speeds after today's
second round, he'll still make the field by using a provisional.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, who is third in points and 234 behind leader Dale
Jarrett, says he'll try to finish the race, despite having to drive
with a cast on his left wrist and a heavy brace on his left leg.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going all the way,'' Martin said. ``That's it. We're gonna
race as hard as we can race.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin, who has six top-five finishes in eight starts on the
1.058-mile oval, has to be helped into his No. 6 Ford. He says his
ribs are still sore from his hard crash last week in practice at
Daytona International Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   Busch Grand National driver Matt Kenseth will practice in
Martin's No. 6 Ford today in case a relief driver is needed Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've gotta be put in (the car),'' Martin said. ``I can do
whatever I really need to, but I don't really need to crawl in
myself, so I'm not. The knee hurts an awful lot and I hurt my ribs
trying to drive the car with no power steering. That's just how it
goes.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett and the pace car
</P>
<P>
   There's been some debate as to whether Jarrett should have been
black-flagged last week for passing the pace car in the final laps
of the Pepsi 400 at Daytona Beach.
</P>
<P>
   After a multicar crash with three laps left caused the race to
finish under a yellow flag, Jarrett, who won the event, drove on
the track's apron to conserve fuel. He momentarily passed the pace
car, but moved behind it before crossing the start/finish line.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Triplett, NASCAR's director of operations, said the rule
preventing cars from passing the pace car is designed to keep
drivers from gaining an advantage under caution. Competitors could
pass the pace car to get to pit road faster or pass it to gain a
lap.
</P>
<P>
   Triplett said Jarrett gained no advantage, so he wasn't
penalized.
</P>
<P>
   Irvan gets another year
</P>
<P>
   MB2 Motorsports, owned by University of Georgia graduates Tom
Beard, Nelson Bowers and Read Morton, has extended the contract of
driver Ernie Irvan through the 2000 season.
</P>
<P>
   Irvan, 40, is in his second season with the team, which jumped
into Winston Cup racing in 1997. Irvan, who's 22nd in points, has
16 top-10 finishes and won three poles in 47 starts in the No. 36
Pontiac.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, obviously, there are other opportunities in the
Winston Cup garage,'' Irvan said. ``You always keep your options
open. But I'm committed to these guys and our sponsor. I'm not
finished, and I think we can win some races with this team.''
</P>
<P>
   Another driver for No. 58
</P>
<P>
   Fledgling Ford owner Scott Barbour introduced his third driver
this season at New Hampshire. Barbour, who started the year with
Ricky Craven behind the wheel before replacing him with Loy Allen
Jr., last month, now has veteran Hut Stricklin.
</P>
<P>
   Allen, the 1994 Daytona 500 pole winner, finished 40th in both
races he started for Barbour this season. Allen didn't qualify at
Pocono on June 20, and the team skipped the road-course event at
Sonoma, Calif., the following week.
</P>
<P>
   Stricklin, who hasn't won a race in 268 career Winston Cup
starts, failed to qualify for six races this year in the No. 90
Ford of owner Junie Donlavey, and finished 33rd in his only start
at Charlotte on May 30. He didn't qualify in Friday's first round.

   GM ORDERED TO PAY $4.9 BILLION IN BURN LAWSUIT
</P>
<P>
   General Motors was ordered to pay $4.9 billion to six people
severely burned when the fuel tank of their 1979 Chevrolet Malibu
exploded after a rear-end collision. The verdict, by a 12-person
jury in a Los Angles state court, came after a 10-week trial in
which the accident victims had argued and produced some evidence
purporting to show that General Motors had known the automobile's
design was unsafe but had not changed the design because it would
have cost about $8.59 a vehicle to do so.

the dollar from nearly $1.18 at its introduction on Jan. 4 to just

 &HT;    Gordon sets track record in winning Jiffy Lube pole
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUDON, N.H. _ Rusty Wallace set the tone in first-round
qualifying for Sunday's Jiffy Lube 300 at New Hampshire
International Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Gordon finished it.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon was one of 17 drivers who broke the speedway qualifying
record, covering the flat, 1.058-mile oval in 29.037 seconds, an
average speed of 131.171 mph. The lap broke Ken Schrader's
two-year-old track record of 129.423 mph.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really surprised with our lap,'' said Gordon, who won
his second pole at New Hampshire. ``That is the most grip I've seen
at this track in quite a while. It's nice to have the air dams and
spoilers where they're at right now, because they're really giving
us a lot of grip.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallace, the first driver to qualify on Friday, had the
second-fastest lap at 130.770 mph. Bobby Labonte will start third,
followed by Schrader and Kyle Petty.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon won his series-high sixth pole of the year and his fourth
in the last eight races. Gordon, the two-time defending Winston Cup
champion, also has a series-high four victories, but he still finds
himself trailing points leader Dale Jarrett by 394 points at the
halfway point of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, 27, finished a disappointing 21st in last week's Pepsi
400 at Daytona International Speedway, after barely missing a
multicar accident with only three laps left. Gordon also had five
finishes of 31st or worse in the first 16 races, which helped put
him in the hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``We kind of put every race behind us,'' Gordon said. ``Once a
race is over, whether it's good or bad, we move on. Right now,
we've been a little inconsistent. We've won some big races and
we're fifth in points, so we can't complain too much. But we've had
some inconsistencies that have kept us out of the points lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless Jarrett really has some problems, though, I don't see
anyone catching him.''
</P>
<P>
   Labonte, who trails Jarrett by 177 points, might be the only
driver with any shot of catching the points leader, who will start
ninth on Sunday. Still, Labonte says he isn't counting Gordon out
of the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just at the halfway point,'' Labonte said. ``We've still
got half the races left to run. If you look at (Gordon's) team,
they're probably the ones who can do it, if anyone can overcome
that many points. I'm not counting anyone out, and I'm sure they're
not counting themselves out, either.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Dale Earnhardt Jr., who chipped his right shoulder in
a Busch Grand National race last week, will start next to his
father in the seventh row. ``Little E'' was seven one-thousandths
of a second faster than his father, qualifying 13th at 129.710 mph.
Earnhardt Jr. finished 16th in his Winston Cup debut at Concord,
N.C., on May 30.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I wanted to do was beat Dale Jr., and I didn't,''
Earnhardt said.
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt fared better than Ford owner Jack Roush, whose five
cars all failed to qualify on the first day.

 &HT;    Perez's illness supplies Chen a sudden start
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Rookie pitcher Odalis Perez was scratched from his
start Friday night because of illness, so the Braves started fellow
rookie Bruce Chen, who originally was going to be skipped in the
rotation heading into the All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Glavine is still set to pitch against the Red Sox on short
rest today; same with Greg Maddux on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Chen was told Friday morning he'd be making his first start
since being recalled from Class AAA Richmond when John Smoltz went
on the disabled list. His last start in Richmond was five days ago,
so the rest worked out perfectly, even if Friday's start didn't.
Chen was roughed up for three runs, all on home runs, and left
after four innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you want to know when you pitch, so you can prepare
yourself for the team,'' Chen said. ``Since I was (going to be) in
the bullpen, I knew I had to be ready for every team.''
</P>
<P>
   This is Perez's first missed start of the year. ``I couldn't
sleep last night,'' said Perez, who has had fever and a headache.
``I want to be pitching. I don't want to be around here, not being
able to go out and do anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Perez had gone six starts without a win, dating back to June 8
against Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``He could use a break; he's done a lot of pitching,'' Braves
manager Bobby Cox said. ``Chen could use a start.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston manager Jimy Williams didn't seem too concerned either
way. ``Two lefties, you know,'' Williams said. When asked if he
still expected to see Glavine and Maddux, he quipped: ``That's my
understanding, unless they want to get sick, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Klesko's hot bat
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Klesko finished off the Marlins series with four hits in
his last 10 at-bats to raise his batting average to .300 for the
first time since the middle of May.
</P>
<P>
   He hit his second home run of the month Thursday after hitting
just three homers in June. He had two doubles in June. He already
has four in July.
</P>
<P>
   Klesko also has improved considerably in hitting with runners in
scoring position since the start of the season. Through May 31,
Klesko was hitting .200 with no home runs and 12 RBIs with runners
in scoring position. In the six weeks since then, he has hit .348
with two homers and 12 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been feeling good,'' Klesko said. ``I've been driving the
ball into the gaps in right-center and left-center. For a while
there I was pulling a little too much.''
</P>
<P>
   Lopez's options
</P>
<P>
   Catcher Javy Lopez, on the disabled list with a sprained right
knee, continues to target next week's Yankees series for his
return. The Braves have the option of using him as a designated
hitter for those three games in New York and three games in
Toronto, though Lopez prefers to test his knee with some catching.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to start catching,'' Lopez said. ``But if I have to DH,
that's no problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Lopez caught for the second consecutive day in the bullpen
Friday, and said afterward: ``It's good enough for me to start
playing, not 100 percent, at least 60 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Ligtenberg update
</P>
<P>
   Kerry Ligtenberg dropped by the Braves clubhouse _ as he does
usually once a homestand _ well-tanned, 15 pounds lighter and fresh
off running the Peachtree Road Race last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was fun,'' Ligtenberg said. ``My wife wanted to do it, so I
did it with her. It was cool to see all the people. ...I usually
run in the offseason. Now it seems every week we're going on a long
run. It keeps me in shape and it keeps me sane.''
</P>
<P>
   Ligtenberg just passed the three-month mark since his April 6
elbow transplant surgery. Being away from the game has been hard on
him, but Ligtenberg said it's gotten easier the closer he gets to
throwing again.
</P>
<P>
   Ligtenberg goes to physical therapy three times a week and lifts
weights four times a week. He had originally planned to begin light
throwing this week but decided to put that off a while. He plans to
start throwing long toss in August, do some 60-foot throwing in
September and throwing off the mound in October. Afterward he'll
shut down for two months and then start throwing again in January.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody tells me if I do that, I should be ready in March,''
said Ligtenberg, who's not promising that'll be the case. ``I did
for a while, but I've gotten away from that. If I set a timetable
and I don't get there, I'll try to rush it and do something stupid.
I feel I will be ready for Opening Day, but I realize it could take
anywhere from six to 18 months.

GOP SENATOR URGES INCOME TAX CUT TO BENEFIT MIDDLE CLASS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Del., Texas)  (th) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Seeking to give a modest break to middle-class
taxpayers as the budget surplus swells, the chairman of the Senate
Finance Committee on Friday proposed reducing the lowest federal
income tax rate to 14 percent from 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal, by Sen. William Roth, R-Del., will be the
centerpiece of the $792 billion, 10-year tax-cutting bill to be
taken up by the Senate later this month. Roth said Friday that the
bill would also include expansions of the Individual Retirement
Account and 401(k) retirement savings programs, a break for married
couples and a variety of proposals for health, education and child
care.
</P>
<P>
   The senator's approach was developed to appeal both to his own
party and to moderate Democrats, who have indicated a willingness
to support a substantial tax cut this year despite the opposition
of President Clinton and liberal Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   By focusing its benefits on the middle class, Roth's plan for a
rate reduction is less partisan and confrontational than the
proposal being developed for House Republicans by Rep. Bill Archer
of Texas, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said Archer would probably ask for a cut in all
income tax rates, a step that conservatives say would reward the
people who shoulder the biggest share of the tax burden but that
Democrats call a giveaway to the rich.
</P>
<P>
   The rate reduction in the Senate plan would mean a tax cut of
$450 a year for a family of four with an annual income of about
$55,000, Roth said, and $250 a year for a single person with an
income of around $30,000.
</P>
<P>
   The senator did not disclose the cost of his proposal, but
analysts said it would be at least several hundred billion dollars
in foregone revenue over the next decade. Aides said Roth would
probably propose that the reduction take effect in 2001, but was
looking at whether it could be done next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``My tax cut plan, which incorporates proposals that have
significant bipartisan support, would cut taxes for millions of
Americans and address the biggest financial issues faced by
individuals and families,'' Roth said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has already made it clear that he will veto any bill
that emerges from Congress this year along the lines of either
Roth's or Archer's plans.
</P>
<P>
   A White House spokesman, Barry Toiv, said Friday that any
surpluses should be used to address a variety of needs beyond a tax
cut, including shoring up Medicare and increasing spending on
health, education and the military.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton has left the door open to a negotiated compromise
over taxes and spending. As a result, proposals capable of
attracting bipartisan support stand some chance of becoming law, a
calculation that was clearly behind Roth's approach.
</P>
<P>
   His plan differs in several ways from Archer's plan in the
House, which will total $864 billion over a decade. Roth is pushing
hard to increase savings and investment by expanding retirement
savings programs, which have long been his favorite tax-cutting
vehicle. But he did not include a cut in the capital gains tax, a
centerpiece of Archer's plan.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did the senator include a favorite idea of conservative
Republicans, the elimination of the tax on estates and gifts.
Archer said Friday that his plan would phase out the estate tax
over the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   Both plans will address the ``marriage penalty'' issue, a quirk
in the tax code that leaves many couples paying higher taxes than
they would if they were single.
</P>
<P>
   Income tax is now levied at a 15 percent rate on adjusted gross
income up to $25,750 for single people and up to $43,050 for
married couples filing jointly. Income above those levels is taxed
at higher rates, starting at 28 percent and rising to a top rate of
39.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Reducing the 15 percent rate alone, even by a single percentage
point, cuts the tax bill of all taxpayers and has the greatest
effect, relative to their tax bills, on the middle class. Cutting
all rates has a disproportionate effect on people paying the
highest tax rates, and thus allocates a greater share of the
reduction in taxes to the wealthy, who pay the most taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Robert S. McIntyre, director of Citizens for Tax Justice, a
research organization that opposes the Republican plans for large
tax cuts, said Roth's proposal was fairer to average taxpayers than
Republican alternatives like a 10 percent reduction in all income
tax rates.
</P>
<P>
   McIntyre estimates that 83 percent of the benefits of Roth's
proposed rate reduction would fall to taxpayers whose incomes
ranged from $25,000 a year to $125,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, he said, a cut of 10 percent in all income tax
rates would overwhelmingly benefit the wealthy, with nearly a third
going to those with the highest 1 percent of incomes, more than
$300,000 a year.

KURD REBEL'S DEATH SENTENCE EVOKES ANOTHER REBEL'S SENTENCE IN
1925  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By STEPHEN KINZER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ In what may or may not have been an eerie
coincidence, the death sentence recently given to the Kurdish rebel
leader Abdullah Ocalan was handed down on the anniversary of the
death sentence given to Turkey's last famous Kurdish rebel leader.
</P>
<P>
   That sentence was pronounced against Sheik Said, a clan leader
and Sufi dervish, on June 29, 1925. Ocalan was sentenced exactly 74
years later.
</P>
<P>
   Before his capture, Ocalan sometimes invoked Said's legacy. Both
said they took up arms because they believed the Turkish state
threatened their people's identity. Both were dealt with as bandits
rather than political leaders. Both became objects of the
government's hatred, with leading officials believing that Kurdish
violence could be ended by hanging them.
</P>
<P>
   It did not work the first time. Kurds did not submit peaceably
after Said's execution. Instead they rose up another dozen times
over the next decade and a half.
</P>
<P>
   At his recent trial, Ocalan said: ``Now is the time to end this
conflict, or it will get much worse.'' Some Kurdish militants have
vowed to launch a new wave of violence if his death sentence is
carried out. Government officials, just as they did in 1925, doubt
Kurds have the strength to do so.
</P>
<P>
   The parallels between Said's case and that of Ocalan are not
exact, but they are remarkable enough to have become the topic of
much conversation in Kurdish intellectual circles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The same thing that happened in 1925 is happening today,''
said Yilmaz Camlibel, an engineer of Kurdish origin who lives in
Istanbul. ``Back then they said there was no such thing as a
Kurdish question, only fanatics working with foreign powers. Today
they also deny that there is a Kurdish question, and say there is
trouble only because terrorists and foreigners are confusing some
Kurds.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Both in 1925 and today, the Kurdish issue brings out the
chauvinism of our leaders,'' Camlibel said. ``It gives them an
excuse to limit democracy and restrict press freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   Said's rebellion broke out less than two years after the
establishment of the Turkish Republic. It was a reaction to
policies adopted by the new Turkish leader, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk,
that some Kurds found intolerable.
</P>
<P>
   Ataturk was carrying out an aggressive campaign to secularize
his new country. His curbs on the power of religion horrified the
devout sheik and his followers.
</P>
<P>
   The new government also appointed non-Kurds to many local posts
in the Kurdish region, began a campaign to change Kurdish place
names, and banned the use of the Kurdish language in schools and
courts of law.
</P>
<P>
   Historians still argue about whether Said rebelled to defend
Kurdish rights or to establish religious rule in Turkey. But one of
his manifestoes called for creation of a Kurdish state, and some of
his most fervent supporters were members of Azadi (Freedom), an
organization dedicated to Kurdish nationalism.
</P>
<P>
   Said and his followers began their rebellion in February 1925.
Among the first towns they took was Lijje, now known by the Turkish
name Lice. To this day Lice is one of the most rebellious towns in
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   The government quickly took emergency measures, some of which
are remarkably similar to ones imposed after the current conflict
broke out in 1984. Emergency rule was imposed. Special tribunals
with broad powers were set up to try suspected rebels and
collaborators. Offenders were punished under a loosely worded law
banning ``all reaction and rebellion,'' and ``all instigation or
encouragement thereof, or the publication of anything liable to
upset the order, social harmony or tranquillity of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   At one point Said's rebels came close to seizing Diyarbakir, the
largest city in the Kurdish region, but they were finally defeated
by the Turkish Army. The army soon began taking reprisals on
villages and clans that had supported them, perhaps sowing the
seeds of future uprisings.
</P>
<P>
   After a brief trial, a judge told Said and 46 of his comrades:
``You have all acted on behalf of one cause, the establishment of
an independent Kurdistan. You will pay with your lives, by hanging
from the gallows of justice, for the blood that you have shed and
the families you have destroyed.''
</P>
<P>
   On his way to the gallows, Said is said to have told the judge:
``I like you well, but we shall settle our accounts at the last
judgment.''

 &HT;    Matching up China and U.S. women's soccer
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   GOALKEEPING
</P>
<P>
   Briana Scurry has had perhaps the best stretch of her career
during the World Cup. She played particularly well in the
semifinals against Brazil and has shown athleticism and composure
under pressure. Gao Hong is considered one of the best keepers in
the world, although her World Cup showing has not been airtight.
She tends to be a little flamboyant, but she also has the ability
to make the dramatic save. Both keepers were named to the FIFA
all-star team.
</P>
<P>
   ADVANTAGE: United States
</P>
<P>
   DEFENSE
</P>
<P>
   This has been the weak link of the American team, although Carla
Overbeck and Kate Sobrero in the middle and Joy Fawcett on the
right side generally have been reliable. Brandi Chastain plays the
left side. The slow U.S. foursome has been broken early in almost
every game, and the speedier Chinese will try to exploit the Yankee
D. Wen Lirong, Fan Yunjie and Bai Jie have been tough to crack for
China, which has posted two shutouts in elimination play.
ADVANTAGE: China
</P>
<P>
   MIDFIELD
</P>
<P>
   Liu Ailing, showing why she's one of the most lethal playmakers
in the world, scored two goals against Norway in the semifinal. The
Chinese also have an exciting new force in 19-year-old Pu Wei. The
U.S. team has been inconsistent at times, although Michelle Akers
demonstrated her indispensability against Brazil. She will have to
be up to the task once again. Kristine Lilly has had some moments,
but Julie Foudy has been quiet during the World Cup. ADVANTAGE:
China
</P>
<P>
   FORWARDS
</P>
<P>
   Sun Wen is the most complete and explosive player in the
tournament. She has scored seven goals and poses matchup problems
no matter the opponent. Her quickness, instincts and excellence in
the air are unmatched, and she has the perfect partner in Jin Yang.
Mia Hamm has been double- and triple-teamed repeatedly but has done
a fine job as an offensive threat. In drawing corner kicks, she has
opened chances for her teammates. She will have to do more for the
Americans to win. So will Tiffeny Milbrett, whose speed makes her
contribution vitally important. Look for super-sub Shannon
MacMillan to play a role.
</P>
<P>
   ADVANTAGE: Even
</P>
<P>
   FINAL ANALYSIS
</P>
<P>
   These teams are not mysteries to each other, having met three
times already this year. China has won two of them to boost its
already high level of confidence and is entering the final in top
form. But the Americans might have more depth and should be able to
relax now that they've reached the finals. The pressures on the
U.S. team to get here have been immense, while China has waltzed
through its two elimination games. As in the 1996 Olympic final,
which the Americans won over China in thrilling fashion in Athens,
this one has the makings of a classic. The Yanks have shown
remarkable resiliency in holding off Germany and Brazil, but they
could be in for a long afternoon if China gets on the board early.
FINAL SCORE: China 3, United States 1

 &HT;    Day game gives teams less time to wait, worry
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ After fidgeting most of the day while waiting
for the Olympic final match three years ago, Briana Scurry is
grateful she won't have the same problem for the World Cup
championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played China in the Olympics at night, and you had a lot of
time to think about things,'' said Scurry, the U.S. goalkeeper. ``I
think the feeling is the same, but I'm glad we're playing this one
during the day.''
</P>
<P>
   A rival among many
</P>
<P>
   Their biggest games may be against China, but U.S. players
weren't ready to declare it the biggest rival they have.
</P>
<P>
   Not after scraping by Germany and Brazil in their past two
games, and having a losing (10-11-1) record against Norway.
</P>
<P>
   ``China's our big rival now because we're playing them next,''
midfielder Michelle Akers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are five teams at the top that on any given day can beat
the other,'' said defender Carla Overbeck. ``China has become a big
rival for us, but so are the Norwegians and the Germans and the
Brazilians.''
</P>
<P>
   Just enough flash
</P>
<P>
   Chinese goalkeeper Gao Hong is known to be flamboyant _ daringly
coming off her line and dramatizing difficult saves. ``But she
doesn't do it to a point where it's annoying,'' U.S. coach Tony
DiCicco said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Gao's got nothing on Nigeria's Ann Chiejine, who juggles
the ball after making saves and openly taunts foiled attackers. It
didn't happen much in a 7-1 rout by the U.S. team.
</P>
<P>
   ``She did some things our players didn't like, at least in some
of the other games we saw,'' DiCicco said. ``We liked what she did
in our game though _ picking the ball out of the back of her own
net.''
</P>
<P>
   Not the only game in town
</P>
<P>
   Norway and Brazil will meet in today's third place game.
Together with China and the United States, they make up a World Cup
foursome that is identical to the one that played in the medal
rounds of the 1996 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping close company
</P>
<P>
   Chinese players warming up for practice stared for a while as
several dozen reporters walked along the Rose Bowl sidelines after
leaving the U.S. locker room.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Americans, China has extremely limited player
availability to the press, allowing only one day this week with
star Sun Wen. And the Chinese coaching staff was more than upset
when its closed practice on Thursday was delayed because the
Americans were conducting lengthy media interviews near the
training field.
</P>
<P>
   A cool grand
</P>
<P>
   An extra 3,000 tickets went on sale earlier this week, raising
the official Rose Bowl capacity for the championship game to around
88,000, but the asking prices for some scalpers are still on the
rise.

<P>
   CHUY, Uruguay _ The 40 percent devaluation of the Brazilian
currency, the real, has shaken stock markets across Latin America
and pushed neighboring Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay into
deepening recessions. But people are smiling in Chuy.
</P>
<P>
   After years of stagnation, the streets of Chuy (pronounced
chwee) that straddle the Brazil-Uruguay border are once again
clogged with horse-drawn carts and rusty minivans filled with
merchandise from around the world, including bountiful loads of
counterfeit watches and whisky smuggled from Paraguay.
</P>
<P>
   The shopping spree began on the first rainy days after the
devaluation in January, when hordes of Argentines who were
vacationing in Punta del Este deserted the beaches and made the
two-hour drive here to buy towels and sheets. Their pesos, pegged
to the strong dollar, were suddenly golden in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   The Argentines went home for winter, and the boom has slowed
somewhat. But Uruguayans from as far as Montevideo continue to
travel here to buy cheap food and clothes before filling their cars
with cheap Brazilian gasoline and oil for the trip home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need a crisis on one side of the border or the other,''
said Mohamad Kassem Jamaa, 39, mayor of the Brazilian side of Chuy
and a leading retailer on both sides of town. ``When Brazil is
doing well, we are in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   In good times or bad, Chuy always goes its own multicultural
way. The FM radio station alternates tangos with sambas and bossa
novas. The typical restaurant fare includes Uruguayan steaks and
Brazilian puddings.
</P>
<P>
   The town even has its own dialect, Portunol, with words that mix
Spanish and Portuguese. ``Fuchebol'' means soccer here, and
``yeitino'' means ``opportunity'' or ``profit.''
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the exotic nature of the place is the large Arab
business sector, consisting of the offspring of Palestinian,
Lebanese and Jordanian rag traders who came here in the 1960's to
take advantage of opportunities that sprang from a wave of
hyperinflation and devaluation in Brazil. Some stores hang pictures
of Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader, among their sale signs.
</P>
<P>
   Business and economics are hardly dismal sciences in Chuy _
spelled Chui on the Brazilian side of Avenida Brazil, which is
called Avenida Urugui on the Brazilian side of the narrow stone
island that marks the border. Hedging, speculating, money
laundering and smuggling are time-honored trades on both sides of
this town of 20,000 people that looks like one big strip mall in
need of a paint job.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Brazil is in crisis,'' a Uruguayan retailer, Mariano
Fernandez, 51, said, ``it's a big help.''
</P>
<P>
   The first thing that Fernandez does when he wakes up in the
morning is check the newspaper for news on the Brazilian economy.
The last thing that he does at night, he said, is switch on a
Brazilian television news program for signs of financial trouble
across the border.
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez is attentive, because his business _ one shop for
spare automobile parts on the Uruguayan side and a second a few
blocks away in Brazil _ depends on which way the Brazilian currency
is fluctuating.
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez said he was a happy man these days, because he
anticipated last year that President Fernando Henrique Cardoso of
Brazil would devalue the real after his re-election. Fernandez
overstocked his warehouse on the Brazilian side with spare tires,
spark plugs and brake linings while cutting inventory in his
Uruguayan store.
</P>
<P>
   In the months since the devaluation, Fernandez said, his sales
have grown 50 percent, even though his Uruguayan store has almost
no customers.
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment is climbing, and retail sales are plummeting across
the Southern Cone, but there are jobs for virtually everyone in
Chuy. Workers laid off from stores on the Uruguayan side merely
cross the border, and no one looks at their passports or asks for
working papers.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the duty-free shops on the Uruguayan side that are
licensed to sell only to foreigners compensate for their shrinking
Brazilian trade by selling their French perfumes and Chilean wines
to Uruguayans. Salesmen simply do not ask customers for passports,
and local customs officials do not seem to care.
</P>
<P>
   The owners of the depressed Uruguayan stores also compensate by
illegally, but openly, exchanging currencies without paying the
authorities in Montevideo a cent in regulatory fees or taxes.
</P>
<P>
   There are no firm estimates of how much business Chuy's hundreds
of stores and kiosks do, and neither the Uruguayan nor Brazilian
governments carry out much if any monitoring. But the freewheeling
nature of Chuy has a sinister side, foreign law-enforcement
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials have expressed concern that Middle
East terrorists maintain clandestine cells in Chuy and other
freewheeling border towns to profit from smuggling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chuy is a Persian market,'' Julio Dornel, 60, who owns an
appliance store, said. ``Everything is illegal but condoned.''

<P>
   PUTRAJAYA, Malaysia _ Until last month, Malaysia's new capital
city was more rumor than reality. Tightly guarded, rarely
photographed and cloaked in mystery, it lurked somewhere in the
endless glade of palm-oil plantations south of Kuala Lumpur _ an
Atlantis on dry land.
</P>
<P>
   Now the new capital, Putrajaya, is suddenly open for viewing.
While it is still mostly a construction site _ with loggers hacking
orderly rows of palm trees and earth-movers churning acres of red
soil _ the little of it that has been built is raising hackles in
this politically tense country.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad moved here last month, along
with 800 civil servants. His office, a massive green-domed complex,
sits across a sparkling man-made lake from an only slightly less
massive green-domed complex, which is his official residence.
</P>
<P>
   The Brobdingnagian scale of the place has led critics to accuse
Mahathir of putting up a costly monument to himself _ and at a time
when Malaysia is still nursing its wounds from the Asian economic
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's bigger than the White House and 10 Downing Street put
together,'' said Lim Kit Siang, an opposition leader. ``Even
without a recession, you couldn't justify a thing like this. It's
on too colossal a scale.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody here seems to know just how big the residence is. The
government has not issued a floor plan. Even now one can only gaze
at it shimmering in the distance. Still, with its vaulted central
dome and a succession of wings that cascade down a terraced
hillside, it looks plenty big.
</P>
<P>
   Mahathir does seem a bit sensitive about the house. At a news
conference in Putrajaya Friday, he reminded reporters that much of
it will be used for public events. Otherwise, he offered a
characteristically pungent defense of Putrajaya as an investment in
Malaysia's long-term future.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't build monuments,'' he said, ``we build things we can
use. It is meant for the government of the future, maybe 100 years,
300 years, 1,000 years. I wouldn't know, I won't be around by
then.''
</P>
<P>
   For now Mahathir, 73, is very much around. Despite a turbulent
year in which he battled the economic crisis, imposed draconian
controls on Malaysia's currency markets, and ousted and imprisoned
his protege and deputy, Anwar Ibrahim, the prime minister seems
determined to cling to power.
</P>
<P>
   Political oddsmakers here say Mahathir may call parliamentary
elections as early as September to capitalize on Malaysia's
improving economy and the disarray within the opposition. So its
leaders are seizing on Putrajaya as a cudgel to beat back the
resurgent prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   Fadzil Noor, head of Malaysia's largest Islamic party, said that
if his party gained power, he would ``get the richest kings in the
world to buy and rent out Putrajaya.'' A senior government official
replied that this remark revealed a party lacking in ``ability to
lead the nation in the next millennium.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever else one may say about Putrajaya, it is most
determinedly a city of the future. Mahathir conceived the project
in the early 1990s as a laboratory for a new form of electronic
government. In the prime minister's Huxleyan vision, paper _ and
its attendant bureaucracy _ would be replaced by the Internet and
other forms of digital communication.
</P>
<P>
   Putrajaya sits next to Cyberjaya, another new city that is
trying to lure technology companies and become Malaysia's Silicon
Valley. Both are wired with the latest in fiber-optic cable and
digital technology.
</P>
<P>
   Together, the Jayas _ the Malay word means success _ symbolize
Mahathir's 17-year campaign to transform Malaysia from a British
colonial exporter of palm oil and rubber into an Asian high-tech
powerhouse that makes semiconductors and designs computer software.
</P>
<P>
   Putrajaya also has a more mundane purpose. It will relieve
congestion in Kuala Lumpur, a cramped and rapidly growing city of
two million. While Kuala Lumpur will remain the official capital of
Malaysia, all government offices are to move 25 miles south to
Putrajaya by 2012. The total cost of the project is estimated at
$5.2 billion, of which $1.3 billion has been spent so far.
</P>
<P>
   The steep price tag has drawn fierce criticism from opposition
leaders and others. Malaysia is crawling out of its worst recession
in a generation, and many of its largest banks and companies are
insolvent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decision to build Putrajaya was ambitious, but it was in
keeping with the thinking of the time,'' said K.S. Jomo, a
University of Malaya political economist. ``But the decision to
keep going after the crisis hit was incredible. It is like Marie
Antoinette saying, `Let them eat cake.'''
</P>
<P>
   Jomo said it was less apt to compare Putrajaya to Palo Alto or
some other wired suburb in Silicon Valley than to Brasilia, the
eerie modernist city built from scratch as the capital of Brazil.
``In Brasilia,'' he said, ``you had this architectural dream that
became a nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
   To his critics, Mahathir has fallen badly out of touch. At a
time when Malaysia ought to be reforming its economy, these critics
say, the prime minister is forging ahead with the kind of
megaproject _ remember Petronas Towers? _ that landed it in trouble
in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   But even his opponents concede that people here may not be
sufficiently outraged by Putrajaya. ``If this was a country with
massive poverty, it would have more of an impact,'' said Chandra
Muzzafar, an adviser to Azizah Ismail, the wife of Anwar Ibrahim,
who has formed a new opposition party.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly Mahathir does not sound like a man under pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not extravagant at all,'' he said in a good-natured
tone. ``A person is extravagant if he lives beyond his means. A
billionaire spending $1 billion is not being extravagant if he has
the money. But if a person is a millionaire and spends like a
billionaire, that's being extravagant.''

$4.9 BILLION JURY VERDICT IN GM FUEL TANK CASE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: ADDS lawyers' first name in 7th graf, deletes it in 9th
graf.) 
(ATTN: Ariz., Fla.)  (rk) 
 By ANDREW POLLACK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In what is believed to be the largest award ever
in a personal-injury lawsuit, General Motors Corp. was ordered
Friday to pay $4.9 billion to six people severely burned when the
fuel tank of their 1979 Chevrolet Malibu exploded after a rear-end
collision.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict was reached by a 12-person jury in state court here
after a 10-week trial in which the accident victims had produced
some evidence purporting to show that General Motors had known the
car's design was unsafe but had not changed it because of the cost.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict, which included $107.6 million in compensatory
damages and $4.8 billion in punitive damages, is likely to raise
questions once again about whether jury verdicts in personal-injury
and product-liability cases have got out of hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an enormous, incredible windfall to whoever gets it,''
said Gary Keating, a law professor at the University of Southern
California, who said he could not recall another award of that
size. ``It turns the court system into a lottery.''
</P>
<P>
   But Keating, who said he is not a big critic of current court
procedures, said it was highly likely the verdict would be reduced
on appeal or that the parties would settle for a lesser amount. ``I
think it's true that the chance of this verdict surviving is almost
nonexistent,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But if the verdict were to stand, it would be a significant
burden for GM, which reported earnings of $3 billion from
continuing operations in 1998. Brian J. Panish, the lawyer for the
plaintiffs, said there are 30 to 60 other lawsuits involving
fuel-tank fires of the Malibu and other General Motors so-called
A-body cars, including the Pontiac Grand Am, the Oldsmobile Cutlass
and the Chevrolet Monte Carlo, which have a similar fuel-tank
design. Last year, a jury in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., awarded a
family $60 million after an accident in which the fuel tank of a
Cutlass exploded, killing two people and burning four others.
 &UR;  &LR; Patricia Anderson, her four children and a family friend, Jo
Tigner, were driving home from church in Los Angeles on Christmas
Eve in 1993 when she slowed to stop at a red light and a drunken
driver plowed into their car from behind at what the plaintiffs'
lawyers said was 50 miles per hour and General Motors says was 70
miles per hour. The people in the Malibu suffered severe burns.
Mrs. Anderson's daughter Alisha Parker, now 11, was horribly
disfigured on her face and lost her right hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``The jurors wanted to send a message to General Motors that
human life is more important than profits,'' Panish, the lawyers
for the accident victims, said.
</P>
<P>
   Panish said that the gas tank on the 1979 Malibu was only 11
inches from the rear bumper while in some prior year models it had
been more than 20 inches away. He said the testimony presented
during the trial showed that it would have cost General Motors
$8.59 per vehicle for a safer design but that the company had
decided it would be cheaper to settle any lawsuits that arose.
</P>
<P>
   One key piece of evidence, he said, was a memo written by an
Oldsmobile engineer named Edward Ivey in 1973 in which he estimated
that fuel tank fires were costing General Motors only $2.40 per
vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   General Motors, in a statement, maintained that the car's fuel
tank was safe and met or exceeded federal standards. ``This
extremely severe crash was caused by a single factor _ drunken
driving,'' the company said. It said it would appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Richard W. Shapiro, a Phoenix attorney who represented the
automaker, said the verdict was ``shocking'' and noted that the
jury had not been allowed to hear evidence that the driver of the
other car was drunk and went to jail. He also said the company had
been barred by the judge. Ernest G. Williams of Los Angeles County
Superior Court, from presenting evidence showing the safety history
of the vehicle and also from presenting crash-test data showing
that the car's design was safer than the one the plaintiffs
advocated.
</P>
<P>
   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has conducted
two safety investigations into the Malibu since the 1970s but
neither involved the fuel system, said Timothy Hurd, a spokesman
for the agency. He said the agency had recently notified automakers
that it was reviewing whether to tighten its rules on protecting
fuel systems but that this was unrelated to the Los Angeles case.
</P>
<P>
   But Joan B. Claybrook, who was the administrator of the highway
safety administration during the Carter administration, said Friday
that big verdicts in personal injury lawsuits were sometimes the
first signal to regulators that a safety problem existed. ``Could
this car be a problem and NHTSA. not know about it?'' asked Ms.
Claybrook, who is now president of Public Citizen, a consumer
advocacy group. ``Absolutely.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ms. Claybrook said she first learned of problems with Ford
Pinto's gas tank and ordered a federal investigation after a $125
million personal injury verdict in 1977. That award, and another
big one involving the Pinto fuel tank, was subsequently reduced
substantially. But the Pinto was later recalled because of the fuel
tank problem.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Hoar, an adviser to plaintiffs' lawyers in many lawsuits
against auto companies, including this case, said the verdict was
the largest ever in a personal injury case. He said the plaintiffs
might have been particularly successful because they presented
evidence that General Motors had lobbied in the early 1970s against
tougher standards for protecting fuel systems in crashes.
</P>
<P>
   Other lawyers said that the size and wealth of General Motors,
the nation's largest company, were taken into account by the jurors
in deciding on the size of the punitive damages.
</P>
<P>
   Jurors told reporters that that they felt the company had valued
human life too lightly. ``We're just like numbers I feel to them,
statistics,'' one juror, Carl Vangelisti, told Reuters. ``That's
something that is wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Anderson, the plaintiff said, ``I'm just glad that justice
was done.'' She said she was relieved, too, that the court decided
that General Motors was at fault. ``I have always blamed myself for
this,'' she said ``I couldn't give my children an explanation'' for
what happened to them.

ONLINE GROCER ORDERS $1 BILLION WORTH OF DISTRIBUTION AND DELIVERY
CENTERS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Ill., Wash., Texas)   By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Only a month ago, Webvan Group Inc., a Silicon
Valley startup that sells groceries on line, was taking its first
orders from customers. Friday it placed a sizable order of its own,
asking Bechtel, the engineering and construction giant, to build
distribution and delivery centers in 26 markets.
</P>
<P>
   Even as Internet deals go, the price tag was impressive: $1
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Webvan, a privately held company based in Foster City, Calif.,
is the brainchild of Louis Borders, co-founder of the Borders
bookstore chain. Though it trails online grocers like Peapod Inc.
of Skokie, Ill., and Homegrocer.com Inc. of Bellevue, Wash., in
coming to market, it has aggressive expansion plans.
</P>
<P>
   It operates a 330,000-square-foot distribution center in
Oakland, Calif., serving the Bay Area, and says it will begin
operations in Atlanta early next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Infrastructure is everything,'' said David Cooperstein, an
analyst with Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass. ``To do online
sales the right way rather than the rush-to-market way they need to
develop a very complex distribution system.''
</P>
<P>
   In groceries, profit margins ``are so tight you need to figure
out where the leverage is,'' Cooperstein said, adding that Webvan
had determined that the leverage was in distribution.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say online grocery shopping is a tough market to crack
because customers expect high quality and are unwilling to pay
extra for the convenience. Grocery stores already operate on
razor-thin profit margins without the added expense of delivery,
and the perishable nature of many foods does not make operating
from a central location feasible. By some estimates, an online
grocer must do 10 times the volume of a typical store to be
successful.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Bill Gates, Microsoft's chairman and chief executive, has
said online grocery shopping could account for a third of U.S. food
sales by 2005. But Jupiter Communications estimates that the online
grocery market will grow from $350 million in 1999, to $3.5 billion
in 2002. That would make groceries one of the largest online
commerce categories but still less than 1 percent of the total
grocery market in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Today just 0.1 percent of groceries and health-and-beauty items
are bought on line in the United States, compared with 4 percent of
airline tickets and books and 9 percent of software, according to
Jupiter.
</P>
<P>
   Since its founding last year, Webvan has raised $100 million of
venture capital from Knight Ridder, CBS, the Softbank Corp. of
Japan and two of Silicon Valley's leading venture-capital firms,
Benchmark Capital and Sequoia Capital. The company is expected to
raise capital through the sale of as much as $1 billion in junk
bonds this year, as well as a possible initial public offering.
</P>
<P>
   Most established grocers have only dabbled in the online market,
like Albertson's Inc., which is testing an Internet store in Dallas
for nonperishables only, or Wholefoods, which ships nonperishable
natural foods from its headquarters in Austin, Texas, and a few
perishables from a site in Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think this is all good for the space,'' said John Fischer,
interactive marketing director for Wholefoods.com, of the Webvan
expansion plans. ``We have a niche that can only benefit from the
expansion of the market.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike earlier Internet grocers, who relied on human shoppers
racing down aisles to fill online orders, Webvan's operation is
highly automated. Webvan opened its Bay Area service on June 2.
Customers can place orders on line all day, seven days a week and
select a convenient delivery time within 30 minutes. Orders are
delivered the same day or up to five days later.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Mannella, Webvan's vice president for marketing, said the
two-year Bechtel deal would enable the company ``to accelerate the
national rollout we had planned.'' Bechtel, based in San Francisco,
said most of the 26 centers would involve retrofitting existing
warehouses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our partnership with Bechtel is a major step forward for our
company,'' Borders, Webvan's chief executive, said in a statement.
``It accelerates our distribution capabilities, and it enables us
to focus fully on our core competency, delivering a superior
product directly to a customer's home or office.''
</P>
<P>
   Borders co-founded Borders Books in 1971, before selling it to
the Kmart Corp. in the early 1990s. Since that time he has been
chairman of Mercury Capital Management, a small investment firm,
and a consultant to other companies.

 &HT;    Where does women's soccer go from here?
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ By almost any measure, the first Women's
World Cup soccer tournament in the United States has been a
smashing success.
</P>
<P>
   On the field, the American team moved undefeated through the
opening rounds and faces archrival China in the championship today
at the Rose Bowl (3:50 p.m., ABC).
</P>
<P>
   In the stands, the U.S. team has averaged 65,000 fans per game,
and today's attendance will set a U.S. record for a women's sports
event. A sellout crowd estimated at nearly 90,000 _ bigger even
than the men's World Cup final played here in 1994 between Brazil
and Italy _ will include President Clinton and an assortment of
Hollywood celebrities.
</P>
<P>
   Off the field, much of the nation seems to have fallen in love
with the wholesome, ponytailed image of the U.S. squad. Talk show
host David Letterman has taken a liking to the team, proclaiming it
``Babe City.'' Hordes of young girls have adopted the players as
picture perfect role models. And in sports bars and restaurants,
televisions have been tuned to the women's games, away from the
usual fare of men playing baseball and basketball.
</P>
<P>
   After today, these Girls of Summer will step out of the
spotlight, and the more familiar American sports will reclaim their
place. And the future of women's soccer in America remains as
uncertain as before this U.S. women's team burst onto the scene
after winning the Olympic gold medal in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   At the grass-roots level, soccer enthusiasts are excited about
what the success of this event will mean for the sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the interest in this team among young girls, I
think millions more of them will want to play soccer and follow
soccer in this country,'' says Marla Messing, president and CEO of
the World Cup organizing committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some small way, we have all been a part of history. ...
It's been like a cultural shift and the way the tournament caught
fire, we've tipped into something. We think ... that people will
look back in 20 years and say, `That event is responsible for the
development of women's sports.'''
</P>
<P>
   At the national level, establishing a professional women's
league is a priority for American soccer officials. But they
concede that converting short-term excitement over a big event into
sustained support for a women's league in a minor sport is a very
big task.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many sports on our landscape,'' Messing said.
``People will follow the U.S. women's national team. But it is
going to be very challenging to establish a successful league.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Soccer Federation is doing a feasibility study to
determine how such a league might be structured. But unlike the
WNBA (Women's National Basketball Association), women's soccer
can't call on an established male benefactor. In its fourth season,
men's Major League Soccer continues to struggle to gain its own
foothold while losing millions of dollars each year.
</P>
<P>
   Opinions are split over whether the image of the U.S. women's
team _ which seems to embrace both that of its young female fans
and of Letterman _ will benefit the sport's future.
</P>
<P>
   Raising quite a few eyebrows was the racy dimension generated by
defender Brandi Chastain on the eve of the World Cup, when she
bared nearly everything for Gear magazine. Dipping into a catcher's
crouch and holding only a well-placed soccer ball, Chastain
combined one image of the American female with a new one of
athletic accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   The players might be the daughters of Title IX, but they clearly
want little to do with some of the feminist rhetoric espoused by
leading women's sports advocates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have anything to hide,'' Chastain said. ``I wanted to
show myself in a positive way, that a female can be a woman and a
good athlete and feel good about her body. I don't think I've hurt
women's athletics or women's rights in any way.''
</P>
<P>
   But such gestures also could lead to a perception of women's
soccer as a team sports version of figure skating or gymnastics,
the so-called ``Bambi'' sports that some males love to denounce
simply because they have a strong following among women.
</P>
<P>
   ``We laugh at it,'' Chastain said. ``It doesn't change what we
do on the field as soccer players.'' Elsewhere in the world, soccer
is regarded as overwhelmingly masculine, much as the NFL and
college football are here.
</P>
<P>
   In England, the Arsenal club of London, one of the biggest and
richest in the world, is virtually alone in having established a
complete system of adult, reserve and youth teams for women. But
two years ago, Kelly Smith, one of its most promising young
players, left to play at Seton Hall University in New Jersey,
choosing to develop her skills with a college scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   And the English Football Association only now is pouring
resources into the women's national team since inheriting it from
another organization in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know that they're obstructing anything, but they're
just not encouraging it,'' said FIFA spokesman Keith Cooper, an
Englishman. ``You have to remember that it was only a little over
10 years ago that this thing started rolling.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in China, some of the stars of its World Cup team have
admitted that their families were concerned about them playing the
game. Star striker Sun Wen has said that as a girl she turned heads
more for her gender than for her eye-popping talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we are the champions,'' assistant coach Yang Zhongjian
said, ``then I think we will be given more support by the society.

HEAD OF TEACHERS' UNION URGES MORE FLEXIBILITY IN CONTRACT TALKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The president of the American Federation of Teachers called
Friday for a drastic change in the way union contracts are
negotiated with the nation's 17,000 school districts, saying
individual schools should have far more power to make educational
decisions in consultation with their teachers.
</P>
<P>
   In a major concession for a union that has jealously guarded the
prerogatives of seniority, the president, Sandra Feldman, said
school administrators should have the freedom to select the
teachers who best suit their school's needs without being bound by
seniority.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Feldman said the million-member union would make such a
concession on seniority only if there was trust and respect between
labor and management.
</P>
<P>
   Her proposal, in a speech in Washington to 2,000 teachers and
educational administrators, was part of a broader call for greater
spending for education, increased training for teachers and tougher
standards for the nation's schools.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Feldman proposed having local teachers' unions negotiate
streamlined contracts with school districts covering basic issues
like salaries and benefits. Most educational decisions, like class
size, the length of classes and how many classes teachers could
teach, would be left to individual schools, where they would be
worked out by administrators and teachers.
</P>
<P>
   In this way, Ms. Feldman said, teachers would have more
responsibility to develop their schedules and formulate the
curriculum. The proposal seeks to treat teachers as professionals
who would share major instructional decisions with principals at
individual schools. That is a sharp departure from the current
system, in which unions and school boards negotiate most details at
the district level, leaving little room for individual schools to
stray from the general agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Feldman's proposal is in part a response to the growing
movement for charter schools, independent public schools that are
not bound by district rules and that, to the union's chagrin, are
often allowed to operate without union rules.
</P>
<P>
   It also has much in common with a new plan sponsored by the
United Federation of Teachers in New York City, where Ms. Feldman
was president before becoming head of the AFT two years ago. Under
that plan, endorsed last month by Chancellor Rudy Crew, teachers
who agree to work in 40 of the city's failing schools will get a 15
percent pay increase and a stronger role in school management in
exchange for longer hours and mandatory teacher training.
</P>
<P>
   In her speech Friday, Ms. Feldman said the new contracts she
envisioned ``would be vehicles for the continuing reform of our
educational system _ a way to maximize resources to classrooms and
to slim down administration.''
</P>
<P>
   Educators praised Ms. Feldman's proposal, but they said it would
play out differently in large urban districts with scores of
schools than in smaller suburban districts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The underlying principal is basically right on,'' said Karen
Zumwalt, dean of Columbia University Teachers College. ``It's where
those of us who have worked with teachers have been arguing we
should be moving toward.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the nation's largest teachers' union, the
2.4-million-member National Education Association, said Ms.
Feldman's proposal was in keeping with its own calls for ``a new
unionism _ advocating for quality at the bargaining table and a
less confrontational approach'' with school districts.

SOCCER'S REWARDS SHOULDN'T INCLUDE A PRICE TAG
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Everywhere Tisha Venturini goes these days,
parents spill their dreams to her. They tell the U.S. midfielder
how much they're looking forward to their 8-year-old daughters some
day getting college soccer scholarships.
</P>
<P>
   There's something about their sentiments that doesn't set well
with her, mainly because for Venturini and the rest of the U.S.
Women's World Cup team, soccer until just recently wasn't about
chasing some carrot. It was its own reward.
</P>
<P>
   To a woman, the U.S. players embraced the game because of how it
made them feel about themselves. The sport made them strong, imbued
them with confidence, gave them the courage to take risks, forged
their identities.
</P>
<P>
   They've played all these years for the pure love of it. Their
passion wasn't fanned by any potential payoff. They had to really
value soccer to stay with it because it certainly wasn't making
them rich.
</P>
<P>
   Not in the material sense, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things that makes (the U.S. women) so popular is
... they just want to go out and play soccer as best they can and
support each other and win gold medals,'' U.S. head coach Tony
DiCicco said. ``That genuine pursuit of their visions and their
dreams and goals is what's so enticing.''
</P>
<P>
   He's right. Never mind David Letterman's ``Babe City'' label,
what has made the U.S. women so attractive is their joie de vivre.
</P>
<P>
   They seem wed to their sport for all the right reasons, unlike
so many kids coming up ``who just expect things to be handed to
them,'' said Joy Fawcett, a U.S. defender and the former women's
soccer coach at UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   As Venturini has discovered, the seeds of entitlement are being
planted early.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you hear parents talking about getting their kids soccer
college scholarships, you cringe,'' she said. ``Things like that
were never a motivation for us. Women's soccer is so pure right
now. You hope it stays the way it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Alas, you fear it's too late.
</P>
<P>
   Some time between the U.S. squad's opening win over Denmark on
June 19 in East Rutherford, N.J., and its World Cup title match
today against China at the Rose Bowl, an age of innocence appears
to have been lost.
</P>
<P>
   In a society where money confers legitimacy, it probably was
inevitable that capitalism would replace a
one-for-all-and-all-for-one camaraderie as the topic on the
training table.
</P>
<P>
   You just didn't want to believe that day would arrive so soon,
less than a month after the U.S. players became the talk of every
town they passed through.
</P>
<P>
   Before the U.S. national team was drawing 2,000 people to a
practice and 90,000 to a match, its members were juggling soccer
and second jobs and stretching a $5 bill tauter than cellophane
wrap to make it cover their day's meals on the road.
</P>
<P>
   They've come a long way. But instead of embracing the moment
like any athlete at any level should _ and as they always have _
some of the U.S. team members seem to have lost their perspective.
It's like they've become mesmerized by the neon dollar signs
flashing on some distant horizon.
</P>
<P>
   To borrow a word from Venturini's vocabulary, you cringe when
you hear women who have moved a nation with their magnanimity
clamoring for the creation of a women's professional soccer league
_ and fast. It's as if they went from being perspicacious to
impertinent overnight.
</P>
<P>
   You wonder if maybe they haven't been reading too many of their
press clippings. Sure, they're as big in this country as the Spice
Girls were two summers ago. But look at the Spice Girls today.
They've been scattered to the wind, torn asunder by hubris and
their own hype.
</P>
<P>
   Is that what the U.S. team wants?
</P>
<P>
   It sounds presumptuous when defender Brandi Chastain says:
``We're demanding a pro league. You can't deny us that because you
think there's a lack of interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever, you wish they could have held off any talk of a better
future until after they had taken care of their unfinished business
at the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Please don't misunderstand. This is not to suggest the women are
wrong to want the same opportunities and advantages their male
counterparts enjoy. If there's a pro league in the U.S. for men, a
women's league ought not to be far behind. Some say it's an
absolute must if the U.S. women are to remain one stride ahead of
the developing programs from such countries as Brazil and Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   But revolutions don't happen overnight.
</P>
<P>
   A staff of nearly 200 spent three years tirelessly laying the
groundwork for the 1999 Women's World Cup. Their stated mission of
``staging a breakthrough event for women's sports and inspiring the
next generation of female athletes'' has been accomplished largely
because of all the work done behind the scenes.
</P>
<P>
   It's a huge leap from a three-week parade of pride and
patriotism to a months-long celebration of soccer and it is best
not taken blindly or brazenly.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, to glance at the crowds the Los Angeles Galaxy is
drawing is to sometimes wonder if Major League Soccer wasn't an
idea before its time.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the future holds, you wish the U.S. women wouldn't lose
sight of the fact that soccer already has given them so much. They
are more confident and composed and cooperative and disciplined and
determined and worldly and wise for having participated in the
sport.
</P>
<P>
   A professional soccer career lasts but a few years. The sport
has equipped these women with skills to last them a lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   You wonder if they aren't selling themselves short, angling for
professional playing jobs when they could be CEOs or senators;
difference makers in a larger arena.
</P>
<P>
   You listen to Mia Hamm say of her teammates, ``After all this is
said and done, I know all these people are going to be incredibly
successful in whatever they do,'' and it dawns on you that she gets
it.
</P>
<P>
   She understands there are goals out there that have nothing to
do with soccer.

 &HT;    Don't expect high-scoring duel in U.S.-China match
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ A common score tells the story of the rivalry
between the United States and China.
</P>
<P>
   In all three previous meetings this year, the score has been 2-1
(China won twice), and the teams split friendlies on the East Coast
in April by grabbing winning goals in the waning moments.
</P>
<P>
   And the same score won the 1996 Olympic final for the U.S. team,
on an electric August evening in Sanford Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Based on those four results, today's World Cup championship
match between the United States and China doesn't figure to veer
far from the script.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think any of us needs any more motivation for this
game,'' U.S. coach Tony DiCicco said.
</P>
<P>
   And while it might be a real treat for the estimated Rose Bowl
crowd of 88,000, for the teams it means the likelihood of 90
agonizing minutes, and possibly more, before a winner is
determined.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not a whole lot of scoring going on,'' U.S. goalkeeper
Briana Scurry said. ``All of our games with China lately have been
tight. It's going to be tough.''
</P>
<P>
   And if you throw in what they've done during the World Cup, the
margin for error could be extremely small. The U.S. defense,
although it has been soft early in some matches, has surrendered
only three goals. China has let two get by.
</P>
<P>
   However, China has been so explosive offensively that, combined
with its recent results against the U.S. team, the Americans
actually might be an underdog.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have to be considered the favorites,'' DiCicco said.
``They've breezed through the knockout rounds.''
</P>
<P>
   April 25 still stands out as perhaps China's soccer red-letter
day. It's not the first time the Chinese had beaten the Americans;
the U.S. leads the series 11-5-5. But that's when a 94th-minute
goal by reserve Zhang Ouying snapped the Americans' 50-match home
unbeaten streak at Giants Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. team had won the same way two days earlier on a goal by
Tisha Venturini, but China's belief that it could beat any team
anywhere was cemented.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is probably the best team we've had in a few years,''
China coach Ma Yuanan said. ``I want the team (that played on April
25) to show up.''
</P>
<P>
   Striker Sun Wen has been the scoring star of the tournament. She
shares the lead with Brazil's Sissi with seven goals and has an
excellent supporting cast. The entire Chinese lineup is very quick,
technically sound and committed. Midfielder Liu Ailing has been at
the top of her game, and goalkeeper Gao Hong has played well, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``The offensive play of the Americans is the best part of their
team,'' Ma said. ``The speed and the skill level of the two teams
is the same. But on our team, there are some players who are
stronger. There's no individual on the U.S. team who can do what
Sun Wen can do.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the Americans haven't brought their best game
to the World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not even close,'' reserve forward Shannon MacMillan
said. ``We know we didn't play that well against Germany, and we
hung on to beat a very good Brazil team. We know we can play
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Mia Hamm, who has scored two goals and two assists, hasn't been
at her best, but she and Tiffeny Milbrett have the speed and skill
to threaten China.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to make sure that everything comes together for us,''
Hamm said. ``We need to be patient and not get frustrated. Our best
soccer is yet to be played.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Oneida County is seeking to levy fines of as much as
$1.5 million against the organizers of the Woodstock '99 music
festival, but the organizers and county officials say they expect
the three-day concert to begin as planned on July 23 in Rome, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The fines were levied by the county's Health Department for what
it said were several violations of the mass-gathering permit it had
issued to Woodstock's organizers.
</P>
<P>
   The Oneida County Executive, Ralph J. Eannace Jr., said Friday
that most of the violations were not serious, but concerned late
submissions of engineering plans, parking plans and a payment to
New York State for repairs it had made to the Gov. Thomas E. Dewey
Thruway for the anticipated influx of 200,000 to 300,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   But Eannace said the amount of the fines is negotiable, once the
Woodstock producers comply with the permit requirements. ``We do
not anticipate cancellation; we fully anticipate compliance with
the remaining issues and the concert going forward,'' he said in a
telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   That is a considerably more optimistic tone than that sounded
earlier in the day by an Oneida County assistant attorney, Joseph
Hobika Jr., who told The Associated Press that Woodstock organizers
must pay the fines, whatever the final amount turns out to be, by
next Thursday or face the possibility that the county would cancel
the show.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Lang, one of the producers of Woodstock '99 and its 1969
eponym, held in Bethel, N.Y., called the reported violations and
fine ``a big splash in a teacup. There's certainly no ultimatum on
anybody's part,'' he said. ``They had to make some kind of official
statement to satisfy the state regs. I expect that we will have an
agreement in the next day or two.''
</P>
<P>
   The permit, a complex set of standards for any gathering larger
than 5,000 people for more than 24 hours, became state law in 1970
specifically to prevent the chaos that enveloped Bethel after the
original Woodstock. In their effort to comply, Woodstock organizers
submitted a 4,000-page tome to local officials last spring.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers of this year's festival, which is located about 110
miles upstate from the original concert's site, say they have sold
more than 150,000 tickets so far.

CHRISSIE'S BACK _ 'NUFF SAID
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE FERMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``They don't make 'em like they used to/You should have just
stuck with me.''
</P>
<P>
   As an opening salvo on a rock 'n' roll CD, the chorus of
``Popstar,'' the lead-off track from the Pretenders' ``Viva El
Amor!'' is as right as right can be. Chrissie Hynde is addressing a
former boyfriend whose girlfriend dreams of stardom, but she's
obviously also referring to all those who would have counted her
and her band out after years of inactivity and spotty CDs.
</P>
<P>
   And right she is. ``Viva'' is a terrific, spiky rock 'n' roll
record, a statement of purpose by a woman who was at the forefront
of the English punk/New Wave movement, attained stardom early, hit
another peak with 1984's ``Learning to Crawl,'' and then did a
long, slow fade: four CDs since, none of them more than fair.
</P>
<P>
   Lord knows how long it will be before the next Pretenders CD, so
let's savor the moment: ``Viva'' finds Hynde, 47, still roaming the
streets, still in love with the idea of being a rock star, still
with much to say about the world around her, from hope for a
romance ``(Dragway 42)'' to class distinctions ``(Nails in the
Road)'' to the ache of lost love ``(Who's Who).'' That mix of
toughness and tenderness, of holding the world at arm's length but
wanting someone to hold her and be true, has characterized her best
work, and that sense is here, all dusted off and gleaming.
</P>
<P>
   Musically, ``Viva'' explores little new territory musically.
Good thing, too, because the new wrinkle, a song in Spanish called
``Rabo de Nube,'' is horrible. Musically, ``Viva'' is classic
Pretenders: sturdy guitar, nods to both New Wave structures and
'60s Motown and Beatle-esque pop, such as on the lovely ``From the
Heart Down,'' which echoes ``Across the Universe.''
</P>
<P>
   What makes this all still work is perspective: Hynde's
continuing status as one of the coolest people on the planet. She
lusts, she loves, she hurts, she tries to negotiate the minefield
of relationships, and she kisses off boyfriends with withering
lines such as the chorus to the hard-rocking ``Baby's Breath:''
``Why did you send me roses?/Save them for someone's death/The love
you have to offer/Is only baby's breath.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a classic Pretenders moment _ something that's been in
short supply for years. For the moment, at least, we've got
Chrissie Hynde back _ and it's as if she's never been away.

IN 1953, BEN HOGAN WON THE BRITISH OPEN _ AND THE HEARTS OF
CARNOUSTIE, SCOTLAND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAN PILLER 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARNOUSTIE, SCOTLAND _ As Carnoustie looks forward to hosting
the British Open this week, sentiment still tugs this seaside
community of 11,000 back 46 years to Ben Hogan's victory here in
the 1953 tournament.
</P>
<P>
   The staging of The Open on Carnoustie's formidable Championship
Course will be, in the words of golf commentator Peter Alliss, ``a
memorable and emotional event'' largely due to Hogan's memory.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Carnoustie, Bob Blyth's eyes glisten as he talks about
watching Hogan in 1953. Blyth was then a 25-year-old schoolteacher
from nearby Dundee. Following Hogan in the 1953 Open turned Blyth
into a lifetime fan of the legendary Texan. Blyth corresponded
regularly with Hogan until the golfer's death two years ago this
month.
</P>
<P>
   Blyth will be at The Open every day this week, but he expects
his mind to wander often back to the July of 46 summers ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hogan had such control over the ball,'' says Blyth, sitting in
the soft afternoon light in the Hogan's Alley pub across Links
Parade from the 18th green of Carnoustie's Championship Course.
``When you saw Ben Hogan hit a ball, you couldn't forget it.''
</P>
<P>
   The memory of Ben Hogan is impossible to ignore here. The course
yardage books for the 7,300-yard Championship Course mark ``Hogan's
Alley,'' on the sixth fairway where Hogan threaded his drives
between an out-of-bounds fence and fairway bunkers en route to
birdies in all four rounds.
</P>
<P>
   There is a Hogan House hotel across the street from the course.
Another big new hotel on the course opened just weeks ago has as
its main lobby decor a collection of photos of Hogan in action.
More Hogan photographs adorn the walls of the Carnoustie Golf Club
meeting room.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Scotland, Hogan is identified so strongly with Carnoustie
that you'd almost think he lived here,'' says Walter Anderson of
Perth, as he looks over golf equipment at the Golf Trap Shop on
High Street. ``Of course, he was only here for two weeks. And he
never came back.''
</P>
<P>
   The person who played the biggest role in persuading Ben Hogan
to play in his one and only British Open, his wife Valerie, said in
an interview in May that she planned to watch every minute of this
week's event on television. Valerie, concerned in 1953 that her
restless husband had run out of worlds to conquer, had joined those
who urged her reluctant husband to make the then-rare journey to
Scotland for the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Valerie's death June 30 at the Westover Hills home she and Ben
had shared stirred memories of the powerful team they made during
Hogan's heyday a half-century ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really doubt that Ben could have done what he did in golf
without Valerie,'' recalls Frank Stranahan of Palm Beach, Fla., who
in 1953 traveled on the same transatlantic flight with the Hogans
and competed in the Open as an amateur. ``Valerie was so organized,
and Ben listened to her like he did to nobody else.''
</P>
<P>
   Golf historians debate which of Hogan's nine major championships
between 1946 and 1953 was the greatest. But Hogan's triumph at
Carnoustie in 1953 was his most significant. Hogan joined Gene
Sarazen (later, Jack Nicklaus and Gary Player) as the only golfer
to have won all four professional major championships _ The
Masters, U.S. and British Opens and the PGA Tournament _ in a
career.
</P>
<P>
   Hogan's victory at Carnoustie came after the 1953 Masters and
U.S. Open. In the 46 years since no golfer has matched Hogan's
achievement of three professional majors in a single year.
</P>
<P>
   The 1953 victory at Carnoustie added another dimension to
Hogan's public persona. He was known as the game's finest shotmaker
who then had overcome a near-fatal car/bus accident. After
Carnoustie, he was the conquering American hero, honored with a
ticker-tape parade up Broadway in New York City, another parade in
his hometown of Fort Worth and athlete-of-the-year awards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before Carnoustie, Ben was known as America's best golfer,
period,'' says John Derr, , longtime CBS correspondent who in 1953
was America's lone electronic media link with Carnoustie.
</P>
<P>
   But, Derr adds, ``the 1953 British Open made Hogan a legend.''
CAPPING A CAREER Ben Hogan didn't plan to play in the British Open
when he set his 1953 schedule. The damage to his legs from the 1949
auto accident had made Hogan a part-time player, limited to the The
Masters and U.S. Open, the Colonial at his home course in Fort
Worth and a handful of smaller events. Hogan's weakened legs
couldn't stand the PGA Tournament, then a two-week, match-play
affair held in July overlapping the British Open.
</P>
<P>
   Interest in the British Open had fallen from its pre-World War
II eminence. The small purse, with first-place prize of just $850
in 1952, compared to $5,000 for Colonial and $10,000 for the U.S.
Open, wasn't enough to cover travel costs. In addition, the British
then played a smaller ball than used in the U.S. and didn't allow
Hogan and other American pros to use the newly popular
center-shafted putter.
</P>
<P>
   Hogan had his personal reason to skip Britain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ben always thought the U.S. Open was the greatest tournament
in the world, and he was afraid that if he played in the British
Open and won it that it would detract from the importance of the
U.S. Open,'' Valerie said.
</P>
<P>
   But at the Masters in April, Hogan was implored to go to Britain
by Augusta National Chairman Bobby Jones, himself a three-time
winner of the British Open. Jones said Hogan needed a win in
Britain to complete his career.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St. Andrews,
governing body of the game outside of the U.S. and conductor of the
British Open, buttonholed Hogan at Augusta and told him they had
increased first-place prize to $1,400 for the 1953 event and would
allow use of the center-shafted putter.
</P>
<P>
   Tommy Armour, winner of the 1931 British Open held at
Carnoustie, told Hogan that Carnoustie didn't have the blind shots
or hidden hazards that Hogan detested. Walter Hagen, another
pre-World War II British Open champion, noted that Carnoustie was
considered the toughest course in Scotland. Valerie said Hagen's
observation made an impact on her husband.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ben always felt that he did best on the toughest courses,''
Valerie explained. ``That is why he played so well in the U.S.
Open. Hagen said that only the very best players could win at
Carnoustie.''
</P>
<P>
   Temporarily setting aside the question of Britain, Hogan won the
1953 Masters with a then-record score of 274. Shortly afterward,
Ben and Valerie were in New York at dinner with a friend, Paul
Shields. After discussing Ben's planned venture into the equipment
manufacturing business, Shields suddenly said ``Ben, you should go
over and play in the British Open. It will complete your career.''
</P>
<P>
   Hogan gave Shields an I've-heard-this-before look and said
``don't you know that I'd have to qualify? I'd probably go all the
way over there and not even get to play in the tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   Valerie, who probably had more influence on her husband than all
the golf legends and organizations combined, found herself
supporting Shields' arguments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ben had never played in the British Open, and it just seemed
like he needed a new challenge,'' Valerie said. ``I think he was
getting bored.''
</P>
<P>
   In May, Hogan won his fourth Colonial tournament. The next day,
he wired his British Open entry to the R&AMP;A. Hogan asked that it be
kept confidential until after the upcoming U.S. Open at Oakmont.
</P>
<P>
   The Ben Hogan of 1953 was in a position opposite most American
pros when considering the British Open. The schedule conflict with
the PGA wouldn't apply to Hogan because he didn't plan to play in
the American event, anyway. And by 1953, Hogan was wealthy enough
to not have to worry losing money on a trip to Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Hogan had done well enough in golf, but as he rose to
prominence, Fort Worth oilmen _ chief among them the Moncriefs _
had connected Hogan to lucrative pieces of the postwar U.S. oil
boom.
</P>
<P>
   Hogan also had received a undisclosed cash settlement from
Greyhound Lines, whose bus had crossed the center highway line and
slammed into Hogan's Cadillac near Van Horn in west Texas in
February 1949. Speculation consistently placed it in excess of
$250,000, worth roughly $1.5 million in today's money and more than
Hogan made in all his major championships combined.
</P>
<P>
   Valerie said ``money was never a consideration for the British
Open.'' TAMING A TOUGH COURSE In mid-June, Hogan won the U.S. Open
at Oakmont in Pennsylvania by a six-shot margin. By the final
round, the secret of his British Open entry was out. The news
electrified Scotland. The British knew their championship had
fallen in grandeur. Now, Hogan's pending arrival would reaffirm
Scotland's seminal place in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Blyth said the low purse had been a problem in attracting
American players.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now Ben Hogan was coming. ... We knew Hogan was the greatest
American player. This would make the 1953 Open special.''
</P>
<P>
   Curiosity was a factor. Alliss, then a young British pro golfer
who played in the 1953 Open and later would become familiar to
American golf viewers as a television commentator, said ``in those
days, players didn't go back and forth the way they do now. This
was before television and very few people in Britain had ever seen
Hogan.''
</P>
<P>
   Hogan's pending arrival generated some some skepticism in Great
Britain. Bernard Darwin, the writer who had followed golf since
before World War I, wrote:
</P>
<P>
   ``It was said that Ben Hogan was the greatest player of his day,
but many in Britain felt that Hogan had achieved his fame on
well-groomed, inland American courses. Let him come to the great
Carnoustie, people said, and we will see what manner of golfer he
is!''
</P>
<P>
   For Scotland, Hogan had to adjust to the smaller British ball,
1.62-inch diameter versus the 1.68-inch diameter American ball.
From tee to green, the smaller ball would help Hogan. It bore into
the wind better and made the 300-yard drive, a rarity in those
steel shaft and persimmon wood days, more achievable.
</P>
<P>
   But the smaller ball rotated more times during a putt,
exaggerating the breaks in greens. By 1953 Hogan was suffering from
the first putting troubles that would dog him for the rest of his
playing days.
</P>
<P>
   Only Valerie knew in 1953 that the car accident had left her
husband with greatly reduced vision in his left eye. That not only
robbed Hogan of crucial depth perception when reading greens, but
limited his look at the putt over the ball. Fearless on the tee and
fairway, Hogan was now hesitant on the green.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ben never really recovered from the car accident,'' Valerie
said. ``But he refused to talk about his injuries.''
</P>
<P>
   Scotland's weather posed another physical concern. Doctors had
saved Hogan's life in 1949 by tying off one of the major arteries
to his leg to prevent blood clots from reaching his heart. The
surgery left him with reduced circulation and vulnerability to
cold. Hogan by 1953 escaped North Texas winters in Florida and
California. Scotland's July wind-chill, even though the term hadn't
yet been invented, would be comparable to a Texas winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got all kinds of long underwear and sweaters, as well as
heaters, to take for the trip,'' Valerie said. ``I was certain that
the cold would be a problem for Ben.''

MUSLIMS DENOUNCE GEPHARDT FOR WITHDRAWING A NOMINEE 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By LAURIE GOODSTEIN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   American Muslim groups said Friday that they were stunned and
betrayed by the decision of the House minority leader, Rep. Dick
Gephardt, to revoke his appointment of an American Muslim to a
congressional counterterrorism commission.
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt decided late Thursday to withdraw his appointment of
Salam Al-Marayati, executive director of the Muslim Public Affairs
Council in Los Angeles, to the National Commission on Terrorism.
Since he made the appointment in June, Gephardt, D-Mo., had been
severely criticized by Jewish organizations that portrayed
Al-Marayati as a terrorist sympathizer cloaked in a moderate's
guise.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Friday, the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination
Committee said of the decision, ``It is shameful that
Representative Gephardt would bow to pressure from pro-Israel
groups who falsely accused Dr. Al-Marayati of being a `supporter of
terrorism.'''
</P>
<P>
   Several non-Muslim religious and political leaders who have
worked with Al-Marayati in interfaith and human rights
organizations also stood by him Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. David E. Bonior, D-Mich., who had originally recommended
Al-Marayati to Gephardt to serve on the commission, said in a
statement: `` Salam Al-Marayati is a person of great integrity, who
has proven his commitment to peace and constructive dialogue. As a
member of the Los Angeles Human Relations Commission, he worked
together with a large number of groups, bringing together people of
all faiths.
</P>
<P>
   ``I regret that Al-Marayati will not be serving on the National
Commission on Terrorism. It is paramount that the commission
include someone with perspective, insight and sensitivity to the
concerns of the Arab and Muslim communities in this country, as
they begin to address the serious problem of terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
   Gephardt sent a letter to Speaker J. Dennis Hastert Friday
formally withdrawing the nomination of Al-Marayati to the
commission, a 10-member group that has six months to review
national strategy for preventing and punishing terrorism against
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The reason Gephardt gave for withdrawing the nomination was that
it would take longer than six months for Al-Marayati to receive the
security clearance necessary to participate on the commission.
Gephardt wrote that Al-Marayati ``is prepared to provide input'' to
the commission, and he encouraged commission members to ``listen to
the voices'' of the American Muslim community.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Marayati said Friday that the episode proved that ``there are
threats to our democracy, and one of these threats is the exclusion
and discrimination that was exposed to us by these developments.''
</P>
<P>
   He said his group, the Muslim Public Affairs Council, will hold
its own counterterrorism forum and issue a paper to contribute to
the dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   Of his critics, Al-Marayati said, ``Either somebody is providing
them misinformation, or they're reading it from a biased lens.''
</P>
<P>
   While many Jewish groups said they were privately applauding the
Gephardt move, not many were eager to claim victory with
celebratory media releases. Some Jewish leaders said they did not
want to be seen as having encouraged the quashing of an appointee
because of his religion or ethnicity. They said their objections
were based only on statements that Al-Marayati or his associates
had made asserting that Israel shared the blame for inciting
Palestinian terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   David Harris, executive director of the American Jewish
Committee, said that while American Muslims deserved a place at the
table, ``this table is not just any table.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This table,'' Harris said, ``is one that was set up to direct
U.S. policy on terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
   The Council on American-Islamic Relations called for Gephardt to
reinstate Al-Marayati, saying: ``Those who represent one side of
the debate cannot be allowed to establish a pro-Israel litmus-test
for any Muslim who is to be considered for government service.''

 &HT;    Will wild Chattooga give up its dead?
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLAYTON, Ga. _ Taking a break from paddling his sleek black
kayak, Tom Cromartie tosses a stick into the Chattooga River at a
treacherous, fast-tumbling stretch known as Raven's Chute.
</P>
<P>
   The chunk of wood disappears into the rushing avalanche of
brownish white water, just as 16-year-old Rachel Trois did in the
cool evening of May 29.
</P>
<P>
   The stick pops up in the foaming water and floats down river.
The teen-age girl wasn't so lucky. Her body has yet to surface,
trapped by the beautiful, perilous Chattooga, made famous by the
1972 movie ``Deliverance.''
</P>
<P>
   Six weeks later, after five failed attempts to retrieve Rachel's
body, a plea by the victim's family for another recovery try has
erupted into a widening dispute with intensely personal and
national policy ramifications.
</P>
<P>
   Search dogs have indicated the body is trapped under eight feet
of churning water, possibly wedged against an undercut rock that
faces upstream like a gaping jaw.
</P>
<P>
   Water rushes between black, smooth-backed boulders with such
force that it blasts skyward like a fountain, marking the spot
where the relentless current hurled Rachel down and won't let the
body go. Cromartie, 27, of Gainesville, was paddling the
Chattooga's treacherous Section IV the evening Rachel slipped while
she was trying to cross the river atop submerged rocks.
</P>
<P>
   The tanned, muscular kayaker came along a half-hour after the
accident, which happened several hundred yards downriver from a
massive boulder known as ``Deliverance Rock,'' where filming of the
James Dickey novel took place. Cromartie encountered a desperate
scene, as Rachel's boyfriend, the boyfriend's father and two other
young men were frantically looking for help in the fading light.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a girl down there!'' one of the boys shouted over the
Chattooga's roar, echoing through the remote, rocky gorge that
separates northeastern Georgia from South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   The girl's father, Joseph Trois, 40, of Leesport, Pa., has
traveled to the river three times. Each time, he has left with
disappointment compounding his grief.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is pretty simple, I want that daughter of mine,'' he said.
``I want her out of the river.''
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to retrieve the body have set off a deepening debate
over how and when _ and even whether _ rescuers should risk their
own lives for somebody who is already dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``The family knows if we are able to get in there, we may be
able to get just pieces of the body,'' said Tom Ramey Jr., 38,
mayor of the Rabun County town of Tiger and a member of the
county's swift-water rescue team. ``If that is what the family
wants, I am willing to try again.''
</P>
<P>
   In South Carolina, Oconee County emergency preparedness director
Henry Gordon, 58, said he believes another recovery attempt should
wait for lower water levels.
</P>
<P>
   Volunteers from Rabun and Oconee counties participated in the
previous efforts. ``We do not want to do anything to risk a life,''
Gordon said.
</P>
<P>
   The debate touches on America's environmental policy. The
Chattooga is a National Wild and Scenic River, a designation that
protects free-flowing waterways from development and from efforts
to divert the water's flow.
</P>
<P>
   Commercial rafters and the Chattooga River Watershed Coalition
protested last month when a New Jersey-based company working for
the girl's family erected a temporary five-foot-high dam of steel
braces and plastic fabric.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Forest Service, which manages the Chattooga, signed off
on the project, which included driving spikes to hold up the dam.
That involved drilling holes in the rocky river bed.
</P>
<P>
   The dam failed when the river, rising due to rain, breached the
plastic fabric in several places.
</P>
<P>
   Even though crews removed the spikes and the rest of the dam,
the coalition's executive director, Buzz Williams, said he believes
the drilling violated the Wild and Scenic River Act because it
altered the riverbed.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly three dozen people have died on the Chattooga since 1970,
bringing occasional demands by grieving survivors that rapids be
permanently altered to prevent other deaths.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not that a few holes have been drilled in the rock,''
said Williams, 48, formerly a Forest Service ranger and a river
guide. ``It's where do you draw the line? There are places that
have been set aside by this country, and they should not be altered
by the hand of man.''
</P>
<P>
   The Forest Service maintains the drilling on June 24 did not
alter the riverbed. Yet in a public meeting Tuesday in Long Creek,
S.C., district Forest Service ranger Michael Crane said he opposed
construction of another temporary dam as potentially unsafe for
workers.
</P>
<P>
   Crane's stance drew criticism from Sen. Strom Thurmond (R-S.C.),
who had asked the Forest Service to work with Portadam Inc. on its
proposal to erect an even taller temporary dam.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Trois had sought help from Thurmond's office in further
efforts to retrieve his daughter's body. South Carolina's senior
senator agreed to exert his influence.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter Thursday to Forest Service Chief Michael Dombeck,
Thurmond urged the agency to consider a new proposal from the South
Carolina Forestry Commission. The state agency recommended the
river be diverted around the recovery site through large pipes, or
through hoses attached to pumps.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither version utilizes (a) dam to stop water flow, which is
unsafe, and virtually impossible to accomplish anyway,'' Miles
Knight, a state forestry commission official, wrote Thurmond's
office.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest wild card is the Chattooga itself. Until a dry spell
brings down water levels, some officials believe further recovery
attempts would be as futile as previous ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is hard to tame that river,'' said Gordon, of Oconee
County. ``You have to work with it the best you can.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SINGAPORE _ On a clear day, Singaporeans can see
recession-wracked Indonesia from their southern shore. From their
living room, Seah Soo Lin and his son Jeng Jye can smell the
archipelago's budding recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Cinnamon, pepper, nutmeg and cloves: an aromatic bounty sits
packed in a jumble of cardboard boxes on the floor. Outside on the
patio, sandalwood chips are piled into a mound on a table. For the
last 30 years, Seah's small family-run company, Chop Wee Kiat, has
traded Indonesian spices and fragrant woods, buying in places like
Timor and Sumatra and selling to customers from Bahrain to Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   Seah, seated in short trousers under a Chinese landscape
painting, might seem unsuited to a discussion of financial market
dynamics. Chop Wee Kiat, after all, is a tiny $5-million-a-year
business in a local market estimated to amount to $1.5 billion a
year. But for small players like Chop Wee Kiat, sticking with this
ancient trade amid the latest financial storms has meant staying in
touch with modern-day economics. Growing competition from distant
suppliers and larger players, meanwhile, means relying on strengths
developed through tradition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nowadays if you want to survive, you must have a good
reputation, be very active and offer good service,'' Seah, 65, said
from behind yellow-tinted bifocals. ``Experience also counts.''
</P>
<P>
   He has plenty of that. Distant relatives from Indonesia
introduced Seah to the trade back in 1969 when they needed someone
to broker the sale of cinnamon sticks from Sumatra. His depth of
experience in Indonesia makes him sanguine today about what will
emerge from the country's economic and political upheaval. ``It
won't be so different,'' he shrugs.
</P>
<P>
   Economic crisis has in fact been kind to the Seahs and their
Indonesian suppliers. When the rupiah plummeted last year, prices
for Indonesian products dropped, too. That put a squeeze on
manufacturers who were borrowing in foreign currency and had to
import supplies, but it was a windfall to those whose livelihoods
sprang from the ground.
</P>
<P>
   And now the spice trade is pointing toward stability and hope
for the future in Indonesia. Agriculture has proved an unexpected
bulwark of the nation's economy, sheltering rural communities from
recession. ``The one sector that hasn't been hit is agriculture,''
said David Fernandez, a J.P. Morgan economist.
</P>
<P>
   Agriculture alone _ representing less than 20 percent of the
economy _ will not be enough to pull Indonesia out of recession.
Further growth in crops will require money from banks, says Stephen
Mink at the World Bank, and Indonesia's banks are being rescued by
the government under a plan the World Bank estimates will cost the
country $60 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Still, agriculture accounts for 40 percent of Indonesian jobs,
and the sector's health has been crucial in containing the spread
of poverty. Farmers outside the densely populated main island of
Java have done so well that last year the World Bank declared the
economic crisis a largely middle-class phenomenon. Jobless
urbanites began filtering back to the countryside in search of
work.
</P>
<P>
   Now, economists say, natural resources, from palm oil and coffee
to pepper and cinnamon, are helping Indonesia claw its way slowly
back to health. Interest rates, once above 70 percent, have been
halved. Inflation has all but disappeared. And in the first three
months of this year, the economy grew from the quarter before _ not
a real recovery yet, but a hint that growth may be around the
corner.
</P>
<P>
   To know the spice trade is to know a good deal about Indonesia.
Traders have been carrying spices from these islands to the rest of
the world for thousands of years, and spices have played a huge
role in the nation's political and economic history.
</P>
<P>
   Spices lured traders from Arabia, Persia and India, who brought
with them Hinduism and later Islam. Spices supported a
seventh-century commercial empire centered on Sumatra that extended
as far as modern-day Thailand and Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
   Arab traders long ago introduced pepper, cloves and cardamom
from Southeast Asia to Europe, where they were treasured as
preservatives and analgesics. Visigoths once ransomed Rome for
pepper. The Arabs kept the source of their spices a secret,
however, until Marco Polo divulged the truth after returning in
1292 from his travels, which included several months on Sumatra.
</P>
<P>
   Once the word was out, Europeans started a race for the Indies,
with spices inspiring the voyages of Columbus, da Gama and
Magellan. Spices financed the expansion of shipping and sowed the
seeds of empire for Spain, Portugal and England. But it was
ultimately the Dutch who captured the true spice islands, trading
Manhattan to the English in return for a tiny island covered with
nutmeg trees.
</P>
<P>
   Singapore's warehouses brimmed with Indonesian spices as the
British port became a transshipment point and home to myriad
companies like Tai Eng Ltd., which opened for business in 1948 on
land now occupied by the Singapore Stock Exchange, according to the
founder's grandson, Raymond Lee.
</P>
<P>
   Farther inland, Seah's home office still has jalousie windows,
and the only air-conditioning comes from a couple of fans. But the
business brings in nearly $5 million a year, enough for him to
raise six children, including Jeng Jye, 32, who earned an
accounting degree at Singapore's top university and then came to
work for the family business.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia's troubles threatened to uproot Chop Wee Kiat's
network of sellers, many of whom were among those
Chinese-Indonesians who fled the country when mobs turned their
rage against them. But after a week or so, Seah said, most of them
returned home. ``They go back because they can make money,'' he
said, slipping back into his native Hokkien dialect.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   With agriculture rebounding, markets for spices and other
extracts are bulging. Consider Indonesia's patchouli. Cultivated
predominantly by small farmers, the leaves of the patchouli bush
yield a pungent yellow oil that lends a soothing fragrance to
soaps, detergents and fancy perfumes. Aromatherapists say patchouli
is good for treating everything from cellulite and athlete's foot
to anxiety and snake bites.
</P>
<P>
   Before the crisis, patchouli prices were at rock bottom and
farmers had begun to dig the bushes up to plant crops they could
eat or sell. But a sharp decline in supplies led to a rebound in
prices just as the economic crisis reached its worst point. After
patchouli prices jumped, farmers responded by digging up food crops
to plant patchouli, and prices have fallen back to normal.
</P>
<P>
   Adequate cultivation is no guarantee of supply, either. Early
this year, so few goods were being shipped to Indonesia that
exporters were unable to find containers to pack their products in.
Banks were in such dire straits that they were declining to issue
exporters letters of credit advanced to guarantee payments. When
Chop Wee Kiat was buying nutmeg last year, Seah said, its partner
in Indonesia had no choice but to ship the spice off and trust that
payment would come.
</P>
<P>
   Cloves are another story altogether. They are used in
Indonesia's most popular consumer item, flavored cigarettes called
kreteks. Encouraged by their success in cornering the nutmeg
market, a group of ethnic Chinese traders decided in 1990 to do the
same with cloves. When the plan failed, they enlisted President
Suharto's son, who persuaded the government to give him a monopoly
on the clove trade. Companies like Chop Wee Kiat had to settle for
cloves from Madagascar and Zanzibar.
</P>
<P>
   One demand imposed by the International Monetary Fund for its
$43 billion aid package was that the clove monopoly be dismantled.
That reopened Indonesia's clove trade to Seah, but confusion has
ensued. While the monopoly could not buy cloves, traders could not
get the money from banks they needed to step in. Huge shipments of
cloves were smuggled out (to the detriment of world clove prices),
but most Indonesian farmers simply stopped bothering to pick and
dry out their clove buds, said Suhas Chougule, general manager of
Surice Trading Ltd., a Singapore spice company.
</P>
<P>
   Lower prices for farmers usually mean fatter margins for
traders, because the end market for spices is largely impervious to
the boom-and-bust crop cycle, Chougule said. ``People who use white
pepper must have white pepper,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the role of small middlemen is under assault by concerns
like McCormick &AMP; Co., a $1.9 billion enterprise in the United
States that bills itself as the world's largest spice company.
McCormick's buyers were once content to deal through local trading
companies like Chop Wee Kiat. But the quest for greater consistency
in quality and price has encouraged big processors to increase
direct purchases from growers.
</P>
<P>
   And the tumult in Indonesia has made the spice trade more
volatile than ever, says Raymond Lee at Tai Eng. During the height
of Indonesia's crisis, he said, prices gyrated by as much as 30
percent in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Market prices are still determined largely by word of mouth.
``There's no securities exchange offering nutmeg futures,'' Seah
Jeng Jye said. It is not uncommon now for spice traders to enter
into their own forward contracts, buying a shipment of cinnamon in
June for delivery later or to simply stockpile a spice in the hope
that prices will improve. Communications are evolving, too, the
younger Seah said. Gone are the telex and cable; Chop Wee Kiat now
takes inquiries by e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Modern ways may be coming, but spice traders hope the business
is specialized enough to require their continued existence.
Experienced spice traders can tell a bad clove bud by sight and can
price sandalwood by how it smolders. ``You need to have people who
know about the trade,'' Lee said.

 &HT;    Slayings suspect previously charged for indecent exposure
 &HT;    By Jim Bebbington
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ The suspect in four Sidney-area slayings Thursday
has spent much of his life bouncing between jobs, three marriages
and run-ins with the law that included sex offenses for indecent
exposure.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Michael Hensley, 30, was convicted twice in four years
for public indecency, but told investigators in one of the cases he
had exposed himself more than 25 or 30 times and wanted help to
make him stop.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not proud of what I've done and I'm really ashamed of
it,'' Hensley told Sidney police detectives investigating a 1995
case in which Hensley was accused of masturbating in a changing
booth in a Sidney clothes store and exposing himself to a female
clerk. ``I'm sorry, but in a weird sort of way I'm glad I did it
'cause my family has found out about the problems I was going
through and they got me help.''
</P>
<P>
   Hensley told police he had received psychological counseling
frequently. He received court-ordered counseling after a 1997
public indecency conviction, and had received private counseling in
Bellefontaine and at the Dettmer Hospital, a psychological care
center in Miami County.
</P>
<P>
   ``I checked myself into Dettmer Hospital but withdrew after my
ex-wife found out about my stay and called me to rub it in,'' he
told police.
</P>
<P>
   Hensley was also convicted in 1997 of exposing himself to a
passing female motorist while driving northbound on Interstate 75,
according to Sidney Municipal Court records.
</P>
<P>
   A Wapakoneta woman told police she tried to pass Hensley's car
when he exposed himself to her, then he sped his car up with hers
until she drove through the highway median to get away from him.
</P>
<P>
   Hensley had put duct tape over his license plate but was tracked
down through a physical description the woman gave of him and his
purple car.
</P>
<P>
   Hensley initially denied being involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you think someone is trying to frame you?'' a police
investigator asked him, according to police reports.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I'm not very well-liked, put it that way,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hensley told investigators he had been exposing himself for two
years by then.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I have a sexual disorder problem and I know I need
help,'' he told Sidney police investigators. ``Some true, honest
help. Someone that will find out why I do this, because deep down I
don't want to do this. I have a lot going for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Hensley was fined $100 and had a five-day jail sentence
suspended for his 1995 public indecency conviction in Sidney
Municipal Court. He was fined $250 and had a 90-day jail sentence
suspended following his 1997 conviction. He told investigators he
served 16 days in Logan County Jail for an earlier indecency
conviction.
</P>
<P>
   Hensley married for the third time in April, after an
eight-month marriage in 1987 and a second marriage that ended in an
acrimonious divorce and custody battle in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   His wife at the time, Jennifer C. Hensley, accused him of
abusing their then 1-year-old son. Hensley denied the charge and a
hearing before a Shelby County magistrate ended in a ruling that
there was no evidence Hensley had abused his son. The magistrate
ordered, however, that all visitations between Hensley and his son
be accompanied by another adult member of Hensley's family.
</P>
<P>
   During the fight over his son's custody, court records show
Hensley was financially strapped, often switching jobs several
times a year.
</P>
<P>
   He told Sidney police investigators during an interview over his
1997 public indecency case that his son was the most important
person in his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please don't take me away from him and please let me get help
until my problem is solved,'' he said.

CIPOLLINI WINS 6TH STAGE OF THE TOUR DE FRANCE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Belgium, Italy, France, Germany, Australia, Estonia, Czech
Republic)   By SAMUEL ABT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MAUBEUGE, France _ Tom Steels of Belgium, who had already won
two sprints in this Tour de France, badly wanted to win the sixth
stage Friday because it ended in the French town of Maubeuge, just
across the border from his home. Erik Zabel badly wanted to win
because he had finished second twice in the last three days and had
not yet won a stage. Mario Cipollini badly wanted to win because he
had won the previous two days and is insatiable, as all great
sprinters are.
</P>
<P>
   In a tumultuous finish, Steels crossed the line first, with
Cipollini second and Zabel third. But minutes later, the Belgian
was disqualified and placed 172nd because of his aggressive and
dangerous tactics. After swerving to cut off Jan Svorada, a Czech
with Lampre, Steels dug his right elbow into Cipollini a few times
just before the finish line.
</P>
<P>
   The elbows could be pardoned as a common offense, but the swerve
was too blatant a piece of interference.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Cipollini, an Italian who rides for Saeco, won for
the third consecutive day. Zabel, a German with Telekom, finished
second once again and for the 17th time this year. Jaan Kirsipuu,
an Estonian with Casino who wears the overall leader's yellow
jersey, moved up to third, with the bullied Svorada fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Steels' Mapei team appealed the disqualification and a 30-second
penalty, with the international jury announcing that a decision
would be made in the next few days.
</P>
<P>
   The winner, whoever he was, finished the 171.5-kilometer
(106-mile) stage in 4 hours 11 minutes 9 seconds, an average of
40.9 kilometers an hour (25 miles an hour). Of the 176 riders left,
172 finished in the same time, with Steels placed by the rules at
the bottom of the first bunch across.
</P>
<P>
   Kirsipuu remained in the lead for a fifth day, 26 seconds ahead
of Cipollini and 38 ahead of Stuart O'Grady, an Australian with
Credit Agricole.
</P>
<P>
   Steels, who trailed at the start by 17 seconds, had hoped to win
the stage and its 20 bonus seconds and vault into the yellow jersey
before the almost home folks. But Kirsipuu won an early
intermediate sprint and its 6 bonus points to thwart Steels' plans.
No jersey, no victory _ his wife probably burned dinner, too.
</P>
<P>
   On paper, where the race is never run, this was another stage
for the sprinters: a warm sun, a rolling course of no particular
difficulty and the knowledge that their glory days in the Tour de
France rival the life span of a fruit fly.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, in the first real challenge of the race, a long time
trial will exhaust the sprinters, who are more accustomed to going
all out for 300 meters than for 56.5 kilometers (35 miles). Two
days later, the Tour enters the Alps, where sprinters are an
endangered species. Cipollini, the best of them, has already
announced that he has a long-awaited appointment for root canal
work in Italy and so must withdraw in the shadow of the first peak.
</P>
<P>
   Several stages are left, then, before the sprinters come to the
fore again after both the Alps and the Pyrenees, and they made the
most of it _ in Steels' case, too much of it _ Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In a macabre way, the combat in the sprint was fitting. This
sixth stage of 20 started in the city of Amiens on the Somme River
and swiftly passed into the countryside where trench warfare was at
its most fierce, destructive and absurd in World War I. Those
rolling fields, now planted in potatoes and corn, were the staging
ground of two vast, months-long battles in 1916 and 1918. British
and Commonwealth forces suffered more than 419,000 casualties, with
20,000 men killed the first day alone in July 1916. German
casualties over all are estimated between 450,000 and 680,000.
</P>
<P>
   The land taken, lost and recaptured amounted to no more than a
few kilometers along the broad front in what was then known as
Flanders.
</P>
<P>
   Some trenches are still there in the fields, preserved for
tourists. As the riders passed through the sunny countryside
Friday, they might have noticed the statues in many villages of a
soldier, his rifle and bayonet pointing at the sky and the names of
the dead filling all sides of the huge stone on which he stood.

 CALIFORNIA INVESTIGATING ENERGY SUPPLIER  &HT;     By REBECCA SMITH 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
SAN FRANCISCO -- Commonwealth Energy, a new electricity supplier
based in Orange County, is being investigated by the state Public
Utilities Commission for retroactively billing about 19,000
California customers a total of $632,000.
<P>
   The PUC said it received 159 formal complaints from customers of
the 2-year-old Tustin, Calif., company, which had customers
throughout the state. Most of the complaints concerned retroactive
billing, poor customer service and Commonwealth's failure to make
good on advertised discounts.
</P>
<P>
   Commonwealth President and Chief Executive Officer Fred Bloom
said that when the state first deregulated the electricity market
last year, his company sent out some bills in error. The
retroactive billing, he said, was simply correcting those mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   However, a report prepared for the PUC by state investigator
Richard Chan said Commonwealth ``had no provision in the terms and
conditions of service ... which authorized backbilling.''
</P>
<P>
   In a preliminary report, PUC investigators said Commonwealth
customers were retroactively billed for as much as seven months
worth of service and for amounts ranging from 7 cents to $2,165.
</P>
<P>
   Customer Howard Thompson from Atwater, Calif., said he wound up
paying Commonwealth higher rates than he'd been paying PG&AMP;E, once
the back-billed amount was factored in.
</P>
<P>
   Commonwealth determined that it had over-billed 520 customers
and ended up refunding them a total of $1,400 in amounts ranging
from one penny to $83.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the retroactive billing problem, state
investigators said the company may have run afoul of the state
utilities code by misleading consumers in direct mail advertising
about the savings available to them.
</P>
<P>
   Various flyers for the company guaranteed savings of 2 to 25
percentoff rates charged by conventional utilities. But many
customers told PUC investigators they didn't receive such a
discount when they switched service, for the energy portion of
their bills, from companies like Pacific Gas and Electric Co.
</P>
<P>
   Commonwealth customer Nadja Sokoloff of Whittier, Calif., told
investigators she was guaranteed savings of 10 percent but didn't
get that amount once the back-billed amount was added. She told
state investigators that Commonwealth was unresponsive to her
complaints.
</P>
<P>
   ``Commonwealth needs to change some of its practices,'' said
Bill Schulte, director of the PUC's investigative unit. ``They're
guaranteeing savings that consumers aren't actually seeing.''
</P>
<P>
   Commonwealth's Bloom said the investigation is without merit. He
accused the PUC of waging a ``witch hunt'' that grew out of a
previous brush the company had with state Sen. Steve Peace, D-El
Cajon (San Diego County), the former chairman of the Senate
Utilities Committee.
</P>
<P>
   In a public hearing last spring, Peace and Bloom got into a
shouting match in which Peace accused Bloom of being a
``charlatan'' and Bloom accused Peace of demagoguery. It ended when
Bloom challenged Peace to settle the argument outside and Peace
declined to leave the dais.
</P>
<P>
   Once the PUC opens a formal investigation, there are several
courses of action. It can negotiate a settlement in which the
subject agrees to mend its ways and pay a fine. It can prosecute a
company and even bar it from doing business in California. Or it
can conclude its case without seeking penalties or redress.
</P>
<P>
   It will be some months before the PUC decides what action, if
any, to take against Commonwealth.

SPIN-OFFS AND STARTUPS PLAYING THE NAME GAME 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID LAZARUS 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
SAN FRANCISCO -- When Hewlett-Packard Co. decided a few months ago
to spin off its noncomputer business into a separate company, that
was the easy part.
<P>
   Now for the hard part: What do you call the thing?
</P>
<P>
   ``We held a mock contest for the name, but it was never a
serious effort,'' said Michael Fournell, a spokesman for ``NewCo,''
which is the code name given by Hewlett-Packard to the new
enterprise. ``We knew we needed an expert.''
</P>
<P>
   They weren't alone. According to Enterprise IG, a worldwide
brand-consulting firm, a record 1,456 U.S. companies adopted new
names in the first half of the year, up 52 percent from a year
before. Nearly a third of the changes stemmed from mergers,
reorganizations and spin-offs.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily for HP, and for numerous other companies in an
increasingly crowded marketplace, there are plenty of experts who
are more than ready to mesh words or syllables into the next
``Coca-Cola'' or ``Sony.''
</P>
<P>
   With trademark or usage rights to just about every word and word
combination already taken, the growing ranks of professional name
consultants are finding their services increasingly in demand as
new or revamped ventures dot the corporate landscape.
</P>
<P>
   And even when a potential name manages to overcome the legal
hurdles, there's still the matter of how it will play overseas in
today's global economy.
</P>
<P>
   A classic miscue came when General Motors Corp. introduced its
Chevrolet Nova automobile in South America. In Spanish, ``no va''
translates as ``doesn't go.'' For its part, Ford Motor Co. turned a
few heads south of the border with a snazzy &LR;   &LR; model called Fiera,
or ``ugly old woman.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The difficulty of finding names is the blessing and bane of
our existence,'' said George Frazier, a partner with San
Francisco's Idiom, a leading name-consulting firm. ``A naming
project can either be an unprofitable headache or it can be the
easiest thing in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard turned to San Francisco's Landor Associates, one
of the top players in the name game. Among other accomplishments,
Landor came up with ``Lucent Technologies,'' when AT&AMP;T Corp. spun
off its Bell Laboratories research arm.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation with Hewlett-Packard is very similar to AT&AMP;T,''
noted Russ Meyer, Landor's executive director of corporate
identity. ``In both cases, you have to balance future vision with
heritage of the past.''
</P>
<P>
   While neither Hewlett-Packard nor Landor is ready to spill the
beans as to the new moniker, Meyer said ``a wide range of names''
has been explored, and that the winning choice will reflect ``the
intellectual and emotional content of the brand.''
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard's Fournell said the new name almost certainly
will be unveiled before the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   What's It Worth?
</P>
<P>
   So what does a new name cost? Although name consultants are
reluctant to discuss how much individual clients shell out, they
estimate that an easy name _ one that doesn't take too long to
concoct or research _ might run about $10,000, while a real
nightmare of a job, with literally thousands of possibilities under
consideration, could cost as much as $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   That's just for the name, mind you. Such other factors as design
of a new logo and marketing can run hundreds of thousands of
dollars more.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the tech world has fueled much of the boom in
the name-consulting field. The fast-multiplying number of Internet
firms has caused a surge in demand for anything-memorable-dot-com.
</P>
<P>
   Lexicon Branding of Sausalito, Calif., was brought in several
months ago when HomeShark, an online mortgage company in San
Francisco, discovered that its name was a potential turnoff for
customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``HomeShark was a name that I'm sure was intended to be
clever,'' said Lexicon's president, David Placek. ``But it had
negative overtones. The word `HomeShark' evoked connotations of
`loan shark.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Lexicon's team aimed to come up with something both positive in
tone and clearer about the company's purpose. ``We just started
pairing words and ended up with a list of 600 or 700 names,''
Placek recalled. ``In that list was iOwn.''
</P>
<P>
   Safe Names
</P>
<P>
   As newly christened iOwn's Web site now explains, the overhauled
name ``echoes the satisfaction and pride our customers feel when
they buy a new home.'' It also doesn't make customers feel like
their kneecaps are in danger if a loan payment is missed.
</P>
<P>
   Different name consultants bring different methods to the mix.
Some prefer to deluge clients with hundreds of choices, and then
work together in winnowing that number down to a short list. Others
favor serving up their single best effort in a well-orchestrated
presentation.
</P>
<P>
   While one might guess that a reasonably clever computer program
should be able to dominate the name business much as IBM's Deep
Blue blew world champion Garry Kasparov off the chess board, those
in the industry are quick to point out the limitations of
technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't use computers to make words, because computers have
no idea what words mean,'' said Ira Bachrach, head of NameLab Inc.
in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   To underline his point, he noted that many name consultants
focus just as much on the sound of a word when devising names for
global concerns. ``You want to use sounds that are part of native
speech,'' Bachrach said, ``and there are very few sounds available
to you.''
</P>
<P>
   Never mind the sound, countered Mel Owen, a trademark attorney
with the San Francisco law firm of Owen, Wickersham &AMP; Erickson. A
greater consideration is the fact that about 3 million words and
names already have been registered with federal trademark
authorities, and that more than 12 million company names now exist
in the United States alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are more and more projects, and fewer and fewer names
available,'' Owen pointed out. ``In the good old days, you could
flip open a dictionary or hold a contest. That's not possible
today.
</P>
<P>
   ``With most of the descriptive words taken,'' he added, ``people
are being forced to take more arbitrary &UR;  &LR; names, like Yahoo.''
</P>
<P>
   Overcoming Net Congestion
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Internet represents the cutting edge of corporate
naming. With millions of sites jostling for attention, and with
competition fierce for a jazzy dot-com address, the trend nowadays
is for in-your-face names that may not have a thing to do with the
company's business.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com, after all, doesn't sell river tours and that hasn't
stopped it from becoming the No. 1 bookstore on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Or take the example of SportSite.com, a San Jose, Calif., online
sporting-goods retailer that was finding it hard to stand out from
the pack. As Fogdog Sports, that's no longer much a problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Creating new names has become a legitimate business service,''
said Lexicon's Placek, who is undeterred by speculation that only a
finite number of names are ultimately possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the day,'' he allowed, ``I'm sure mathematicians
could tell you all possible combinations, but it's huge. For our
purposes, it's practically infinite.''

McENROE SET TO ACCEPT TENNIS' HIGHEST HONOR 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PETE ALFANO 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   He has been portrayed as the van Gogh of tennis, the tortured
genius whose sheer artistry on the court was often overshadowed by
a chronic case of tantrums that offended the game's purists, but
delighted the masses and helped propel the tennis boom in the
mid-1970s.
</P>
<P>
   John McEnroe could be as unruly as his head of curly brown hair
and as delicate as an artist whose brush strokes evolve into
masterpieces. From the time he burst on the tennis scene in 1977,
an 18-year-old amateur from New York who made it through Wimbledon
qualifying and advanced to the semifinals, he was driven by a quest
for perfection, which often drove him and those around him to
distraction.
</P>
<P>
   In a career that spanned three decades, McEnroe made an
indelible impression on the game and helped popularize tennis
around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Walking down the street with him in 1981, I doubt if there
were five more recognizable people in the world,'' said Peter
Fleming, McEnroe's longtime doubles partner. ``In any country,
people would react _ and they'd all react differently. The guy has
an electricity about him that not many people have.''
</P>
<P>
   And today, in Newport, the quaint seaside summer resort town in
Rhode Island, McEnroe will be inducted into the International
Tennis Hall of Fame, taking his place among the legends of the
game.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-two years after he became a fixture in men's tennis, it
is still a matter of conjecture whether McEnroe's volatile nature
contributed to his greatness or was an obstacle that prevented him
from being acclaimed the greatest player of all time. Other tennis
players have misbehaved _ Jimmy Connors and Ilie Nastase come to
mind _ but after having covered McEnroe for most of the past 22
years, it would be difficult to name another player in the history
of the game that has been known as much for his temperament as the
way he stroked a tennis ball.
</P>
<P>
   Although his induction has been a formality, McEnroe has said he
is honored to be taking his place among the game's legends.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not the biggest. I'm not the strongest. I'm not the
fastest,'' McEnroe said when chosen for the Hall of Fame earlier
this year. ``The effort and intensity and understanding of
technique and doing something adventurous, that's what I'd like to
be remembered for.
</P>
<P>
   ``I brought some energy to the sport, a style of play not
duplicated almost at all. I feel I was a good athlete, in some ways
underrated. I had reasonable attributes.''
</P>
<P>
   The years have mellowed him, he said, but at 40, his hair
thinning and sprinkled with gray, McEnroe is still passionate about
the game. He rails against the myopia of former politicians and
failed players who run the men's tour; he is still capable of a
tirade or two during his matches on the senior tour, although he
has said that some of these outbursts are orchestrated.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, he and Connors are not speaking again after an
incident in a senior's match last year in Irving, which is
reminiscent of the days when they were on opposite sides of the
net, baying at the moon and each other.
</P>
<P>
   Is there a better example of McEnroe the temperamental genius
than the footprint he left on the venerable grasscourts of the
All-England Lawn Tennis Club? He won Wimbledon three times but is
probably equally remembered for calling chair umpire Ted James
``the pits of the world,'' during a match in 1981. In retrospect,
that pales in comparison to the multitude of outbursts that
followed.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, the first year of the new men's circuit, the ATP Tour,
McEnroe was disqualified during a match against Mikael Pernfors at
the Australian Open because he did not know the code of conduct had
been made more stringent to discourage boorish behavior. Tour
officials commonly refer to that rule as ``the McEnroe rule,'' and
now it is cited as the reason the men's game lacks personalities.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways McEnroe's career has been a series of
contradictions. He is a pure serve and volleyer, but unlike the
power players of today, his game was about touch, finesse and
strategy, qualities that often eluded him when he chose to speak.
</P>
<P>
   His groundstrokes were not pulverizing; instead he ladled the
ball over the net. Yet he would also try to beat the fuzz off a
tennis ball at the slightest provocation.
</P>
<P>
   McEnroe's serve did not break speed records, but it handcuffed
opponents and allowed him to get to the net. He was a tennis chess
master who saw moves on the court his opponents never dreamed
existed.
</P>
<P>
   McEnroe also was always keenly aware of his surroundings. He
chastised fans, thought he could call the lines better than the
linesmen, and often had a scolding word for his opponent and the
audience. During a match in the season-end championship at Madison
Square Garden one year, McEnroe stood hands on hips, frown on face,
waiting as a substantial woman struggled to her seat after a break
between games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why don't you lose some weight,'' McEnroe told her, loud
enough for 18,000 people to hear.
</P>
<P>
   He is a product of the 1970s, when anti-heroes were the rage.
But his ``McNasty'' persona was countered by his respect for tennis
tradition and history, and loyalty to his country. Even now in his
role as a television tennis analyst, McEnroe is an outspoken
advocate for the Davis Cup.
</P>
<P>
   He virtually single-handedly returned the United States to Cup
prominence. He helped the United States win five Cups, among them
the 1992 Final against Switzerland in Fort Worth, and compiled a
remarkable singles record of 41-8 in Cup play. He added another 18
victories in doubles, making him easily the most prolific Davis Cup
player.
</P>
<P>
   But the Davis Cup produced some less-than-magical moments as
well. In 1981, during a raucous Davis Cup doubles match in
Cincinnati, he almost came to blows with Guillermo Vilas and
Jose-Luis Clerc of Argentina. McEnroe and Peter Fleming struggled
to win in five sets in a marathon match that was delayed more than
30 minutes because McEnroe tore apart the indoor carpet along the
seams in a fit of anger.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, it was Connors, not McEnroe, who embarrassed the U.S.
team with his on-court behavior during the Davis Cup Final in
Sweden. The United States Tennis Association was so apprehensive
about losing financial aid from sponsors, it required players to
sign a letter saying they would conduct themselves properly.
McEnroe refused to sign, and Randy Gregson, then the USTA
president, would not allow him back on the team. McEnroe rejoined
the team in 1987 after Gregson's term had expired.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the histrionics, McEnroe built an impressive statistical
resume. He won seven Grand Slam tournaments among 77 career singles
titles, including the U.S. Open four times and Wimbledon three. He
had another 77 doubles titles, nine of which came in Slams.
</P>
<P>
   He finished as the No. 1 player in the world for four
consecutive years beginning in 1981, totaling 170 weeks atop the
game. He also spent a record 270 weeks as the No. 1 doubles player.
While Fleming was his partner for many of his doubles victories,
the popular saying in tennis was that the best doubles team in the
world was McEnroe and anybody.
</P>
<P>
   ``You couldn't ask for a better partner,'' Fleming said. ``There
were several times that we disagreed, but as a whole he was a great
team player.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say the reason Larry Bird, Magic Johnson and Michael
Jordan were so great is that they made the players around them
better. John was like that.''
</P>
<P>
   What tennis fans will remember more than the numbers, however,
are the battles McEnroe waged against the unholy trinity of
Connors, Bjorn Borg and Ivan Lendl. They helped define him, the
good and the bad.
</P>
<P>
   Connors was his nemesis, the seasoned player who ended McEnroe's
surprising run at Wimbledon in 1977. Their matches were like
barroom brawls with invectives and tennis balls flying. The
atmosphere was charged and fans became rowdy. The genteel sport of
tennis was never the same.
</P>
<P>
   McEnroe and Borg were like fire and ice. They brought out the
best in each other. McEnroe deeply respected Borg and rarely
engaged in gamesmanship when they played. They met 14 times,
splitting their matches, but several were epics.
</P>
<P>
   The 1980 Wimbledon final is considered one of the greatest
matches in history. Borg won in five sets, but not before McEnroe
won a fourth-set tiebreaker, 18-16, fighting off four match points.
He would end Borg's run of five consecutive Wimbledon titles the
next year.
</P>
<P>
   McEnroe also defeated Borg in the 1980 and '81 U.S. Open finals.
Sensing perhaps that the rivalry was becoming one-sided, the stoic
Borg walked off the court after the 1981 Open and into retirement
at the age of 25.
</P>
<P>
   McEnroe did not, however, have the same success against Lendl,
an impassive baseliner from the Czech Republic, who won 21 of 35
career matches against McEnroe and dealt him the biggest defeat of
his career.
</P>
<P>
   It came at the French Open in 1984. Clay is the Achilles' heel
of most American players, McEnroe included. But he won the first
two sets and was up a break in the third of the final. A victory on
the red clay at the French Open would have probably earned McEnroe
acclaim as the best player ever.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he slowly self-destructed, and Lendl fought back to win
in five sets. McEnroe has said that it was his biggest
disappointment and the match that enabled Lendl to become the
dominant player in the game.
</P>
<P>
   McEnroe would recover to win Wimbledon and defeat Lendl in the
U.S. Open final that year, but at 25, those would be the last Grand
Slam singles titles of McEnroe's career. At 5-foot-11 and 165
pounds, and more comfortable with a wood racket, he soon was being
overpowered by bigger, stronger players, and racket technology. The
era of the Stradivarius in tennis had given way to the Fender
Stratocaster.
</P>
<P>
   McEnroe's decline was gradual. He remained a formidable player
during the second half of the 1980s, but his diatribes were
increasing. During the 1986 year-end championship at Madison Square
Garden in January, a fan crashed the post-match interview and asked
McEnroe a rhetorical question about how it felt to lose to a
journeyman like Brad Gilbert.
</P>
<P>
   McEnroe, probably believing this was the most intelligent
question he had been asked in years, contemplated for a moment and
then decided that when he began losing to players like Gilbert, it
was time to quit.
</P>
<P>
   He announced he was taking a sabbatical and exited the interview
area. His next match was in August, at a tournament in Stratton
Mt., Vt. But the seven-month hiatus had not changed him. Even
worse, there were new forces to reckon with.
</P>
<P>
   During a quarterfinal match against a newcomer with long dark
hair streaked with white, McEnroe hit his first serve and watched
the return whiz past his ear at twice the speed.
</P>
<P>
   McEnroe stared hard at 16-year-old Andre Agassi and turned to
look at where the ball had landed, several feet past the baseline.
He had won the point, but he knew the times, they were a changin'.

STRONACH TAKES OVER GULFSTREAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON INDRISANO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was confirmed this week that Frank Stronach, noted
thoroughbred owner/breeder and founder of Magna International, an
auto parts company estimated to be worth $4.4 billion, has
purchased Gulfstream Park in Florida for $95 million. On Nov. 14,
Stronach purchased Santa Anita in California for $126 million, and
he now is reported to be after Monmouth Park in New Jersey to
complete his personal version of the Triple Crown.
</P>
<P>
   Stronach bought Gulfstream through Ventures, Inc., his
acquisition arm, from Orient Corporation. ``We are pleased to have
secured a purchaser who previously has made a substantial
investment in the future of thoroughbred racing,'' said Akihiro
Terada, representing Orient Corp., Tuesday. ``We are confident
Ventures will further strengthen Gulfsteam's ranking as Florida's
No. 1 thoroughbred track, and one of the industry's national
leaders.''
</P>
<P>
   Gulfstream, which is easily accessible from both Fort Lauderdale
and Miami, races from early January until early March, and ranks
behind only Saratoga as the favorite vacation track for New
Englanders. Stronach is likely to move quickly to expand the
Gulfstream meeting, seeking to open earlier, taking on nearby
Calder, owned by his rival Churchill Downs. Flush with cash from
simulcasting, Churchill also has been acquiring tracks, including
Hollywood Park, which is across town from Santa Anita.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a municipality decides it wants to have a racetrack, then
it should allow the meet to be as long as the racetrack wants,''
said Stronach. ``It's like any other business. Only the ones who do
the best job survive, and the ones who don't will disappear. I'd
like to expand the meet, and, if anybody else wants to expand
theirs, that's fine. Let Calder expand, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Stronach doesn't fool around. He swept into Santa Anita and
ordered a $50 million renovation project. Soon thereafter, 17
administrators were let go. Santa Anita was scheduled to host the
Breeders' Cup in 2000, but Stronach's makeover sent the Cup to
Churchill Downs. Guess who has this year's Breeders' Cup?
Gulfstream on Nov. 6, and Stronach will be in charge by then.
However, the Cup expects to stay put in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Not all of Stronach's plans for Santa Anita have been popular.
Among the discussed moves are the elimination of the track's famous
downhill turf course, and paddock gardens. ``I wouldn't say that we
are scared, but we are apprehensive, definitely,'' said Ron Ellis,
who is both a trainer and television commentator. ``It's like
somebody just threw all the pieces of the circuit up in the air,
and we're waiting for them to fall back into place.''
</P>
<P>
   But Stronach does have a backer in popular conditioner Bob
Baffert. ``Stronach wants people with fresh ideas,'' said Baffert.
``He wants to get away from the attitude that says: `This is the
way it's been done, so this is the way it's going to be done.'
We're not going to like all of his ideas, but you at least have to
give the guy a chance. I think we had gotten kind of complacent
here.''

<P>
   Yagli won't run at Ascot
</P>
<P>
   Owner Allen Paulson and trainer Bill Mott have changed their
minds, and will not run Yagli, currently the leading grass horse in
North America, in the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Diamond
Stakes at Ascot July 24. Had they done so, it would have marked a
rare incursion into European racing by a horse based in the US.
Paulson indicated that Yagli is sound, but he and Mott decided the
6-year-old son of Jade Hunter was likely to do better in the $2
million Breeders' Cup Turf, in which he finished second last year,
if they stayed home.
</P>
<P>
   Yagli, who won the Manhattan Handicap at Belmont June 5 in his
last start, will run next in the United Nations Handicap at
Monmouth July 31, or in the Sword Dancer Handicap at Saratoga Aug.
14.
</P>

<P>
   Almutawakel prepares
</P>
<P>
   Almutawakel, who won the Dubai World Cup in March, defeating
Malek, Victory Gallop, and the now-retired Silver Charm, is being
pointed toward the $4 million Breeders' Cup Classic by Godolphin
Stable. Almutawakel will run next in the Juddmonte International at
York Aug. 17. The Juddmonte is on the grass, but the 4-year-old
Almutawakel, who surprised at 44-1 in the Dubai World Cup, is now
considered Godolphin's best older dirt horse . . . Reraise, who won
last year's Breeders' Cup Sprint, will be out for the year after
straining a tendon while training for the Triple Bend Handicap at
Hollywood June 27. That opened the sprint ranks up, and Mazel Trick
responded by winning the Triple Bend by five lengths in track
record time of 1:19 4/5 for seven furlongs. A son of Phone Trick,
Mazel Trick is trained by Bobby Frankel, and takes over the top
spot in the West. Yes It's True, conditioned by D. Wayne Lukas, and
Good and Tough, who won the Suffolk Breeders' Cup May 29, and is
trained by Frank Alexander, will battle for Eastern supremacy when
they meet in the $300,000 DeFrancis Dash at Laurel July 17 . . .
Jockey Bill Patin, who was suspended for five years after the
Arkansas Racing Commission determined he had carried an electrical
device while riding longshot Valhol to victory in the Arkansas
Derby in April, will not be reinstated by the Louisiana Racing
Commission, which refused to renew his license. A Louisiana native,
Patin had been riding at Evangeline Downs under a temporary
restraining order.

NOW THEY HAVE TO PLAY FOR THE CUP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ You mean they have to win this thing now?
Haven't the Babes of Summer done enough already? Haven't they sold
out NFL stadia from coast-to-coast? Put women's soccer permanently
on America's sporting radar screen? Inspired a generation of
ponytailed hooligans? They have to reclaim the World Cup, too?
</P>
<P>
   ``This is it,'' says US goalkeeper Briana Scurry, whose
teammates take on formidable China in Saturday afternoon's final
before a capacity crowd of 90,000 (including President Clinton) in
the Rose Bowl. ``Now we're playing for all the marbles.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Americans, who've spent the last three weeks signing
autographs, talking into a sea of microphones and tape recorders
and ``leaving a legacy,'' having merely to play will be a simple
blessing. ``Getting to the final was for the fans,'' says forward
Tiffeny Milbrett. ``Being in the final is for us.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Chinese, who have never won a Cup medal, just getting to
the final was historic. By winning they can stake an indisputable
claim as the planet's best team.
</P>
<P>
   Though oddsmakers have the US as a 3-2 pick (that's historic
itself: Vegas action on a women's soccer match) even the hosts
concede that the Chinese, who've beaten the US twice this year and
humbled defending champion Norway, 5-0, in the semifinals, are the
favorites.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Americans have always prevailed when a global medal
has been at stake, winning the bronze in the 1995 Cup and the gold
at the 1996 Olympics. And they're playing on home turf in front of
the largest crowd ever to watch a women's sporting event. ``When it
comes down to the 85th minute and we're dying out there, having
people still screaming for us will pump us up,'' says forward Cindy
Parlow.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans expect it will come down to the 85th minute and
more. Their last two games with China in April were both decided in
added time after the clock ran out. The match could go down to
overtime, even to penalty kicks. The sides are that even. ``We are
at the same level,'' says Chinese coach Ma Yuanan. ``The match will
depend on good preparation, good performance, and fighting
willingness.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the US leads the all-time series 11-5-5, 10 of the 16
decisions (including the last three) have been by one goal. ``The
match will come down to who makes the big play in the key part of
the game,'' says US coach Tony DiCicco.
</P>
<P>
   And that likely will come down to which team controls the
midfield. That's been China's secret throughout the tournament and
that's how they took apart the Norwegians, slicing through them,
racing upfield and finishing them off with set-piece goals off
corners and free kicks. ``We gave them too much space,'' says
Norwegian assistant coach Jarl Torske. ``They ran around us and we
couldn't stop them.''
</P>
<P>
   It's no mystery whom the Americans have to stop _ gifted striker
Sun Wen, playmaker Liu Ailing, and flank midfielder Zhao Lihong.
And they have to stop them early, before the Chinese get them down
two goals and scrambling. ``That's how they beat the Norwegians,''
says Scurry. ``They got a couple early and Norway had to come
kicking and scratching back.''
</P>
<P>
   The first 10 minutes is exactly where the Americans have been
vulnerable. They gave up a goal to the Nigerians on their first
shot. They scored on themselves in the fifth minute against the
Germans. But they survived because they had more weapons and more
depth and plenty of time to bring them into play.
</P>
<P>
   If they have an edge over the Chinese (besides their
90,000-voice boombox), the Americans believe it's because they've
been tested by better teams on their way to the final. ``We've been
prepared better by the nature of who we've played,'' says DiCicco.
``The Chinese are athletic, but not as athletic as the Nigerians.
They're organized, but no more so than the Germans. They have
tremendous flair on the ball, but no more so than the Brazilians.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Chinese have yet to face anyone who has more players to
worry about than the US does. The Americans' 18 goals have been
scored by 10 different players and Mia Hamm hasn't tallied since
the 20th minute of the second game.
</P>
<P>
   Balance, experience, resilience, and a healthy dose of euphoria
have gotten the hosts to the winner-take-all match. But just
getting here, they realize, is no longer enough. Their legacy will
be incomplete without a victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the Olympics, when we got to the final everyone just took a
big sigh and said, well, we made it,'' says Milbrett. ``This time,
everyone wants to make sure we end it on a good note. We can't take
a big sigh until this is over with.''

CLINTON ATTACKS GOP ON HMO BILL
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By TODD S. PURDUM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Gearing up for next week's Senate debate on
patients' rights to medical care and insurance, President Clinton
lambasted Republican leaders Friday for what he suggested were
cynical delaying tactics intended to defeat Democratic efforts to
establish minimum federal standards for health maintenance
organizations and insurers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not for it,'' the president told a sympathetic
audience of doctors, nurses and local politicians at the
Harbor-UCLA Medical Center in the southern Los Angeles suburb of
Torrance Friday morning. ``But they know they can't afford to be
caught being against it.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's proposal to guarantee that all patients have access to
emergency room care and cannot be forced to change doctors in the
middle of treatment, among other provisions, died last year after
Senate Republicans kept it from being brought up. The Republicans
argued that it would cost too much and could lead employers to drop
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   But the president insisted Friday that cost increases would be
modest, and added, ``We should err on the side of humanity.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House scheduled Friday's small, carefully staged event
on short notice after Clinton decided to extend his four-day tour
of some of the nation's poverty areas to take in the Women's World
Cup soccer finals in Pasadena on Saturday. But the president used
the occasion to tee-off sharply on the announcement by Republican
senators that they would begin debate on patients' rights next week
with a Democratic-sponsored bill, in an apparent effort to kill it
and avoid having to defend their own bill against Democratic
amendments to strengthen it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw today an amusing article in the paper which said that
the leaders of the majority party had decided that instead of
bringing up their bill and having to deal with 20 of our
amendments, which would put people _ force them to put their
members _ on record as being against these things, they would bring
up our bill and just beat it in the hope that then there would be
no specific record of accountability,'' Clinton said, warming to
the fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought to myself, `What kind of a weird world am I living
in?''' the president said, adding, ``This is about whether some
people live and some people die.''
</P>
<P>
   His remarks came as debate over the issue intensified and
business and insurance groups opposed to the effort began a
$750,000 television advertising campaign intended to sway undecided
Republican senators. The most controversial, and potentially
expensive, feature of the Democratic-sponsored bill would give
patients the right to sue health plans and collect damages when
treatment is withheld.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, whose effort to overhaul the health care system
collapsed spectacularly in 1994, acknowledged Friday that one of
his major goals had always been to rein in rising health care costs
by moving patients into managed care. But he said, ``The purpose of
managed care is to enhance the quality of care by making it as
affordable as possible, not to undermine quality of care by making
the people who provide managed care as profitable as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   The president's performance was one more example of his relative
ease in defining himself in opposition to Republican proposals, and
he seemed to relish the task Friday morning, growing folksy as his
audience in the hospital's auditorium responded with occasional
shouts of, ``Tell it!'' and, ``That's right!''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was introduced by Dr. John Lewin, chief executive of the
California Medical Association, which represents 35,000 doctors in
a state that was an early leader of managed care. Lewin told a
handful of HMO horror stories, like one about a man who died of
cardiac arrest while waiting an hour for his health maintenance
organization to approve treatment because a previous call had
turned out to be a case of indigestion.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, these are not just isolated anecdotes,'' the
president said minutes later. ``This is a systematic problem in
American health care. And once we fix it, all the people will be
happy; the HMOs will do just fine, and they'll be happy we did. And
people will wonder what in the wide world we were doing all those
years not providing these basic protections.''
</P>
<P>
   After most of a week spent highlighting rural and urban poverty,
Clinton turned to the health care issue with a vengeance Friday,
recording his weekly Saturday radio address on the subject of
Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   And after sweltering days among some of nation's poorest
citizens, he returned to the friendly embrace of a billionaire
supporter, Ron Burkle, a California supermarket magnate and
Democratic contributor.
</P>
<P>
   The president is staying at Burkle's sprawling Beverly Hills
estate, Greenacres, the former home of silent film star Harold
Lloyd. Friday afternoon Clinton played golf at the exclusive
Riviera Country Club; the White House told journalists not to
expect any photographs of the game.

CHALLENGING HOLLYWOOD TO MARKET NONVIOLENCE  
 CALIFORNIA BAPTISTS AND HOMOSEXUALS  
 CHANGES IN CHURCH MEMBERSHIP  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By GUSTAV NIEBUHR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   After two teen-age gunmen murdered 12 classmates and a teacher
in Littleton, Colo., in April, the wave of public revulsion was big
enough to crash around Hollywood, as people sought a way to explain
such a horrible event. Society suffers when children are exposed to
so much violence on television and the movies, went the familiar
complaint.
</P>
<P>
   But what to do about that? Last month, cinema operators promised
to work harder at enforcing the R-rating, the movie designation
supposed to keep out under-17-year-olds unless they come
accompanied by an adult.
</P>
<P>
   Another suggestion, less widely heard but intriguing in that it
calls for something of a cultural shift, asked Hollywood to
``de-glorify'' violence, even to show acts of principled
nonviolence.
</P>
<P>
   This idea comes from the Rev. Ellwood E. Kieser, a Roman
Catholic priest who heads Paulist Productions, a maker of movies
about Archbishop Oscar Romero of El Salvador and Dorothy Day,
co-founder of the Catholic Worker movement. Kieser is also
president of an ecumenical organization called Humanitas, which
awards prizes for movies and television shows judged by an
independent panel to reflect human (and humane) values.
</P>
<P>
   At the organization's awards luncheon on Thursday, Kieser
discussed his idea in a speech, having previously mentioned it in
an opinion article in The Los Angeles Times.
</P>
<P>
   ``The heart of my proposals is, let's not point fingers,'' he
said, in an interview beforehand.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he proposes these three things: one, to demonstrate the
``sickness'' that lies at the heart of violent acts; two, to show
how violence can devastate victims' families and wreak inner damage
on its perpetrators; and, finally, to show how nonviolence can work
to resolve conflict.
</P>
<P>
   One can say that Hollywood already does some of this. Kieser
credits Steven Spielberg's successful 1998 film, ``Saving Private
Ryan,'' with showing the cruelty of war and its effect on people
related to those killed in battle.
</P>
<P>
   But where does one go for movies about nonviolent conflict
resolution _ other than to ``Gandhi,'' the 1982 film by Sir Richard
Attenborough about the leader of India's independence movement?
</P>
<P>
   James Wall, senior contributing editor of the weekly magazine
The Christian Century, who frequently writes about movies, said,
``The problem is, so few films focus on people with those
personalities.''
</P>
<P>
   Wall said he did not think a lack of movies about people with
nonviolent principles was ``an ideological choice, but a marketing
choice'' by movie-makers. In other words, if Hollywood thought the
public were interested, it would make more of those movies.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Kieser said, nonviolent movements have been the stuff of
great historical drama, from the civil rights movement in the 1950s
to the Solidarity movement in Poland that eventually brought down
that nation's communist government in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   CALIFORNIA BAPTISTS AND HOMOSEXUALS
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, four Baptist congregations in Northern
California were voted out of a regional organization, the American
Baptist Churches of the West, after it declared them wrong to
welcome homosexual men and women as members, without teaching that
homosexual activity is sinful.
</P>
<P>
   The four appealed the dismissals, a case that came before
authorities in the larger denomination, the American Baptist
Churches USA. Last month, the appeals by all four were denied
(although a church in Ohio, which had been dismissed from its
regional jurisdiction for a similar reason, was granted its
appeal).
</P>
<P>
   This week, the Rev. Jim Hopkins, pastor of Lakeshore Avenue
Baptist Church in Oakland, Calif., the largest of the four
congregations, said the General Board's decision to deny the appeal
was ``a very unexpected move.''
</P>
<P>
   Hopkins said his congregation faced limited options in
responding, among which were deciding to become independent or
``trying to hang on'' by pursuing ``one or two more procedures''
within the denomination.
</P>
<P>
   CHANGES IN CHURCH MEMBERSHIP
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, it became commonplace to hear that mainline
Protestant churches lost many members each year, while evangelical
churches gained. But the 1990s have told a more complicated story,
as membership curves have seemed to flatten out or even, on
occasion, changed direction.
</P>
<P>
   For five years until 1995, for example, the Episcopal Church
reported gaining members. This year, for the first time in decades,
the Southern Baptist Convention reported a membership loss.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the Presbyterian Church (USA) said it had
experienced the smallest membership loss in two decades. In 1998,
the denomination declined by 20,000 members, compared with 22,000
in 1997 and 33,000 the year before. A spokesman for the
denomination, which counts 3.6 million members, said evidence
indicated adults with young children returning to church and an
increase in baptisms of adults with no previous affiliation.

JAMES FARMER, CIVIL RIGHTS LEADER, 79 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va., Miss., La.)   (EDS: Note language in last graf.) 
(EDS: This is an abridged version of a 3,200-word obit that will
move by midnight.) 
 (js) 
 By RICHARD SEVERO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   James Farmer, a principal founder of the Congress of Racial
Equality and the last survivor of the ``Big Four'' who shaped the
civil-rights struggle in the United States in the mid-1950s and
'60s, died Friday at Mary Washington Hospital in Fredericksburg,
Va., where he lived. He was 79. Farmer had been in failing health
for years, losing his sight and both his legs to severe diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   Farmer's main colleagues in the civil rights movement were the
Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. of the Southern Christian
Leadership Conference, who was assassinated in 1968; Whitney Young
of the Urban League, who died in 1971, and Roy Wilkins of the
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, who
died in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Although attention in recent years has focused on King's
activities, Farmer played a towering role in the movement as a
direct-action leader of the organization popularly known as CORE.
Claude Sitton, who covered the South for The New York Times during
the civil rights struggle, observed: ``CORE under Mr. Farmer often
served as the razor's edge of the movement. It was to CORE that the
four Greensboro, N.C., students turned after staging the first in
the series of sit-ins that swept the South in 1960. It was CORE
that forced the issue of desegregation in interstate transportation
with the Freedom Rides of 1961. It was CORE's James Chaney, Andrew
Goodman and Michael Schwerner _ a black and two whites _ who became
the first fatalities of the Mississippi Freedom Summer of 1964.''
The three were murdered by a gang of Klansmen while they were
investigating a church burning and promoting black voter
registration.
</P>
<P>
   Farmer himself risked his life in several demonstrations. In
1963, Louisiana state troopers armed with guns, cattle prods and
tear gas hunted him door to door when he was trying to organize
protests in the town of Plaquemine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was meant to die that night,'' Farmer once said. ``They were
kicking open doors, beating up blacks in the streets, interrogating
them with electric cattle prods.'' A funeral home director had
Farmer ``play dead'' in the back of a hearse that carried him along
back roads and out of town.
</P>
<P>
   Farmer went to jail for ``disturbing the peace'' in Plaquemine,
and was behind bars on Aug. 28, 1963, the day that King delivered
his ``I Have a Dream'' speech as the climax of the March on
Washington. Farmer sent his own speech to the March on Washington,
which was read by Floyd McKissick, an aide in CORE. ``We will not
stop,'' Farmer wrote, ``until the dogs stop biting us in the South
and the rats stop biting us in the North.''
</P>
<P>
   Farmer was a disciple of Mohandas Gandhi, and it was Gandhi's
strategy of nonviolent direct action that was to become Farmer's
weapon against discrimination. A fierce integrationist, he enlisted
both whites and blacks as CORE volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   Some white liberals who generally approved of what Farmer was
doing frequently advised him to be more patient with a recalcitrant
society dominated by whites. They thought that the doctrine of
nonviolence was radical in its use of picketing and sit-ins. Some
thought it engendered bellicose responses from whites that did
nothing to further amicable race relations.
</P>
<P>
   On one tense occasion in the early 1960s, after a particularly
vicious spate of violence, Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy
suggested that Farmer's followers postpone some of their ``freedom
rides'' _ designed to desegregate the interstate bus system in the
South _ so that everyone could ``cool off.'' Farmer refused,
saying, ``We have been cooling off for 350 years.''
</P>
<P>
   As the turbulent decade of the 1960s unfolded, some blacks who
despaired that they would ever have an amicable relationship with
the white majority and regarded nonviolence as more of a weakness
than a strength, on occasion would ask Farmer, ``When are you going
to fight back?'' Farmer would always reply, ``We are fighting back,
we're only using new weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I lived in two worlds,'' Farmer said late in life, recalling
his role in the movement. ``One was the volatile and explosive one
of the new black Jacobins and the other was the sophisticated and
genteel one of the white and black liberal establishment. As a
bridge, I was called on by each side for help in contacting the
other.''
</P>
<P>
   Farmer, the son of a minister and the grandson of a slave, came
to feel that his generation of leaders had been all but forgotten
in recent years. He was appalled to learn that in one survey of
blacks taken in the 1990s, somebody said he thought that King's
claim to fame was that he had ``worked for Al Sharpton'' and that
many young blacks had never heard of Roy Wilkins, Whitney Young and
Farmer or had only the vaguest notion of what they had stood for.
And so when President Clinton awarded him a Presidential Medal of
Freedom in January 1998, Farmer said he felt ``vindication, an
acknowledgment at long last.''
</P>
<P>
   In writing an approving review for The New York Times of
Farmer's memoir, ``Lay Bare the Heart,'' which was published in
1985, Claude Sitton said that Farmer ``more than any other civil
rights leader'' had fought against racism and had ``attempted to
hold the movement true to its purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   Farmer's brief first marriage ended in divorce. He married Lula
A. Peterson, whom he met in 1949 when she was a graduate student in
economics at Northwestern University and a white member of the CORE
chapter in Evanston, Ill. She died in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   They had two daughters, Tami and Abbey.
</P>
<P>
   In his last years, Farmer lived alone in a remote house near
Fredericksburg, confined to a wheelchair and often in need of an
oxygen tent. When visitors came, he would joke about the times he
had come close to death. Asked by a friend if he had ever seen a
tunnel, Farmer acknowledged that he had, but instead of seeing St.
Peter at the end of it, he saw the Devil. ``And he said, `Oh, my
God, don't let this nigger in!' '' Farmer recounted. `` `He'll
organize a resistance movement and try to put out my fire.' '' &QL;

WWC A RICH EVENT FOR ORGANIZERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS AND SHIRA SPRINGER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Like the 1994 men's World Cup here, which had
a $60 million surplus, the women's event will also finish in the
black. The only question is: by how much?
</P>
<P>
   The organizers, who are working on a $30 million budget compared
to the men's $275 million, had projected ticket sales of 475,000
just before the tournament began.
</P>
<P>
   With Saturday's Rose Bowl sellout, the final figure will be over
650,000 tickets sold. ``As big as I thought this tournament could
be,'' says organizing committee president Marla Messing, ``it has
been bigger.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   An added starter?
</P>
<P>
   The final word will come Saturday at breakfast, but all
indications are that Shannon MacMillan has played herself into a
starting role.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will probably start (MacMillan) instead of Parlow,'' said US
coach Tony DiCicco. ``We gain some speed and quickness with
Shannon, but we have some heading ability with Cindy. I don't think
I can go wrong either way.''
</P>
<P>
   But lately, MacMillian has given the American front line better
chemistry. After leading the 1996 Olympic sqaud with three goals
including two game-winners, the California product lost her form
and was relegated to the bench. She entered the 1999 World Cup as a
valuable reserve, and each game saw her minutes and productivity
increase.
</P>
<P>
   MacMillan got her first start and showed her talents around the
goal when the US played North Korea at Foxboro Stadium. Along with
fellow reserve Tisha Venturini, MacMillan proved that America's
second team was just as potent as its starting team. MacMillan
scored one goal and assisted on two other against North Korea. She
was substituted for Julie Foudy in the second half of the US
quarterfinal against Brazil. As soon as she entered the game,
MacMillan took a corner kick that led to America's winning goal.
</P>
<P>
   It's likely MacMillan won't have the luxury of watching her
teammates play for a half and finding weaknesses in the Chinese
defense from the sidelines. And good friend Fawcett won't need to
pysch MacMillan for a substitute role.
</P>
<P>
   ``My role has been changing with every game,'' she said. ``I've
gone from five minutes. I've started. I've played a half. I'm ready
to do whatever it takes whether it's starting or coming off the
bench . . . Accepting the (reserve) role has been really hard for
me. I went from being a starter in the Olympics and then I got a
couple injuries and it was really frustrating. I've grown into my
role and I think because of that I'm a better player. I think I'm
on top of my game.''

   A real trip
</P>
<P>
   Think the Chinese haven't kept a running tally of how many miles
their soccer team has had to travel during this World Cup, compared
to their hosts? Including its round trip to the States, China will
have flown 25,793 miles _ once around the planet. The Americans
will have flown just 4,763. Coincidence? No chance, insists the
Beijing Morning Post, which claims that the tournament organizers
did it on purpose ``because the Chinese team is the American team's
biggest obstacle to taking the championship.'' . . . Marquee
entertainer at the closing ceremonies will be singer Jennifer Lopez
(a.k.a. the female Ricky Martin), whose debut single ``If You Had
My Love'' is topping the charts.

</P>
<P>
   US's revenge
</P>
<P>
   Part of the fun of playing in the final for the US squad will be
knowing that nemesis Norway is playing the Brazilians for third
place. The Yanks are still seething over the ``train'' procession
that the Norwegians did in their faces after knocking out the US in
the semifinals four years ago. ``I remember them grabbing each
other's ankles and crawling around the field,'' says keeper Briana
Scurry. ``I was mortified by it, appalled by it.'' . . . Exhibit
No. 101 why the US women's soccer team is different from its male
professional counterparts: After Friday's final practice at the
Rose Bowl, Foudy, the US co-captain, stood atop a chair in the
locker room and publicly thanked the media hordes who've been
dogging the squad for weeks. ``We always said we were America's
best-kept secret, but now you've put us out there,'' Foudy said.
``We wanted you all to know how much we appreciate it.'' . . . If
the Americans are the Babes of Summer, what are the Chinese players
being called back home? ``China's roses,'' according to one
official newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Scoring machine
</P>
<P>
   China has scored 19 goals this tournament _ two more than the
US. Chinese coach Ma Yuanan claimed there was no secret to his
team's productivity. ``They've already learned the real meaning of
socer,'' said Ma about his players, through a translator. ``Soccer
has its own nature. The nature of soccer is to score goals.'' . . .
The frenzy surrounding the success of the US team has been visible
all tournament long in the host country. But almost a world away,
the Chinese have been tuning in to the tournament. ``China has had
live broadcasts of the games and China is a large country,'' said
Ma of his homeland with a population exceeding one billion. ``The
number of Chinese reporters is the largest (foreign group). The TV
rating in China are over 40 percent. The whole of China is
supporting us back in China.''

Century's greatest athlete? Carl Lewis
<TEXT>
<P>
   By JOHN P. LOPEZ
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   It was a great idea by the cable guys to offer us their list of
the 100 greatest athletes of this century.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since ESPN began paying tribute to its top 50 every Friday
night, it's been water-cooler fodder waiting to happen. It's been a
crescendo of touching memories and moments, with millions of
viewers seeing the list pared week by week.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night, Red Grange galloped onto the list at No. 28. But
of course, that's ESPN's opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Like tax deductions and an affinity for fruitcakes, choosing the
100 greatest athletes of the century is a matter of opinion. Your
Mickey Mantle at No. 37 might be my Hank Aaron. Your top 10 might
be my fifty-somethings.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, as the century draws to a close, it is fitting to
crown someone as the one and only best of the best. But we all have
our personal favorites, our unforgettable heroes, our one-of-a-kind
performers who were like no others.
</P>
<P>
   Who was yours? Michael Jordan? Muhammad Ali? Jesse Owens? Jim
Thorpe? Babe Didrikson Zaharias? Babe Ruth? Billie Jean King? Jim
Brown?
</P>
<P>
   All of those greats are among the candidates most often
mentioned as potential No. 1s. But that's someone else's opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Here, it says something else: Carl Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   Some might not consider Lewis even in the top 10, or _ pointing
to Owens _ not even the No. 1 track star of the 1900s. But much
more than merely Webster's definition of athlete should be
considered when talking about the greatest of the century. After
all, if it was athletic ability alone that determined the best of
the century, Bo Jackson and Deion Sanders probably would be in the
top 10 _ they're not even close _ and Secretariat, which ESPN rated
No. 35, would have them all beat by about 100 lengths.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, the gauge must include much more than ability alone.
Here, the other factors used to come up with a No. 1 were
performance, longevity, the influence on a particular sport and the
dominance shown in the era.
</P>
<P>
   Taking all those factors into account, Lewis rates ahead of them
all.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan might have been the best performer of the century. He
certainly was dominant and defined his era. But should Jordan even
rate ahead of Didrikson Zaharias, who not only dominated as much at
the Olympic level, but probably could have hit a curveball and
definitely had a better golf game?
</P>
<P>
   With respect to Thorpe and Owens, Lewis was simply the greatest
track star of the century. Not only did he match Owens' wondrous
four-gold feat of 1936 with four golds in 1984, but he added two in
1988, two in 1992 and another in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   And who knows what would have happened in 1980, when Lewis also
made the Olympic team, but the Americans boycotted the Moscow
Games? Count 'em. That's five Olympic teams Lewis made, which takes
care of the longevity question.
</P>
<P>
   As for dominance in his era, maybe only Brown, Ruth and Rocky
Marciano could match what Lewis did.
</P>
<P>
   Consider this: An Olympic long jump champion will be crowned in
Sydney, Australia, next year. But whoever that winner might be,
there's a chance he wasn't even born the last time anyone but Lewis
won the long jump gold.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the influence on sport and society. Ali and King
had it, altering so many perceptions, changing the landscape of
their sports and bringing unprecedented style and grace to the
stage.
</P>
<P>
   But more so than Lewis?
</P>
<P>
   Lewis was the outspoken spark who brought the Olympic movement
out of the 19th century and into the 21st. He brought
professionalism to the Games, appearance fees and enormous
marketing possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Would there even have been a Dream Team had Lewis not
persistently shook his fist in the faces of the staid and stuffy
Olympic leadership? Would people like Picabo Street, Tara Lipinski
and Michael Johnson be millionaires today?
</P>
<P>
   Most significantly, no one demanded drug-testing more than
Lewis. No one questioned the cheating more; no one refused to
buckle under pressure as much; no one persistently called for
reform more. Lewis led the charge to bring drug-testing to sports.
Now, it is present at virtually every international event.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, all of the presumed contenders for No. 1 were
marvelous in every way, and your No. 1 might be different than
mine. It's open to interpretation. After all, most of us can only
read about or watch grainy clips of Thorpe, Jack Dempsey and the
like, which admittedly is unfair.
</P>
<P>
   But from what we know, from the gauge used here, the top five
should be Jordan at No. 5, Didrikson Zaharias at No. 4, Ali at No.
3, Ruth at No. 2 and then King Carl.
</P>
<P>
   But that's just one opinion, which is what makes this argument
ever so much fun. See you at the water cooler.

SOME INTERNET STOCK OFFERINGS ARE QUIET EXCEPT FOR ALL THE
SHOUTING  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ANDY WANG    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Some chatter on Wall Street this week disrupted what
is customarily a quiet period.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Goldman, Sachs put Network Plus Corp., a
telecommunications company that offers high-speed data and Internet
services, on its recommended stock list with a price target of $30
a share. Just a week earlier, Goldman, Sachs had been the lead
underwriter of Network Plus' initial offering of common stock at
$16 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette, a co-manager of the $128 million
offering, also started stock coverage of Network Plus on Wednesday
with a buy rating. With the plugs from Goldman, Sachs and Donald,
Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette, shares of Network Plus gained $1.375 on the day
to close at $23.375; they have since slipped back to $21.813.
</P>
<P>
   The announcements raised eyebrows among investors and Internet
stock analysts with experience in what is called the quiet period,
the time before and after a company goes public in which it and its
underwriters are prohibited by federal law from promoting the
stock. The period is intended to give the market time to find an
appropriate price level for the stock.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out, though, that Network Plus already had publicly
traded debt and had been filing reports with the Securities and
Exchange Commission, meaning it is not really a newly public
company. Therefore, Goldman, Sachs was not prohibited from
commenting on the stock.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Goldman said Network Plus is nine years old
and well known and that the transaction was closed before the
recommendation; Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette officials were
unavailable for comment Friday. Still, the investment banks'
actions surprised even the professionals.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is very unusual,'' said Ben Holmes, who tracks new issues
for Ipopros.com. ``Obviously, Goldman, Sachs knows the rules, and
they're playing within them.''
</P>
<P>
   But the restrictions on quiet periods are quite fuzzy. While
many companies and their underwriters refrain from saying anything
publicly during the time immediately preceding and following their
offerings, more companies are saying more than they have in the
past. Internet companies in particular are eager to provide
business progress reports and to continue announcing deals,
something underscored by recent comments from Goto.com, Stamps.com
and Digital Island, among others.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be tough for companies in the Internet to be
quiet,'' said Tim Klein, a research analyst at U.S. Bancorp Piper
Jaffray. ``Promotion is a big part of the game. People are trying
to build a brand.''The quiet period, based in federal securities
law, has never been translated into a specific rule by the SEC. But
it is commonly understood to start when a company hires an
underwriter and to end 25 days after the company's initial public
offering.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't developed a commissioned definition,'' said John
Heine, a spokesman for the SEC, adding that staying quiet is ``up
to the companies' lawyers or people who advise them.''
</P>
<P>
   Holding back just seems too much for many Internet companies,
whose stocks can swing wildly because of day traders' fervor for
the sector and the relatively thin trading in each company's stock.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Goto.com, an Internet search service that went public
on June 18. Twelve days later, the company announced that it had
attracted more than 10,000 advertisers, 80,000 affiliate Web sites
and an estimated 10 million unique users. ``The increasing level of
enthusiastic participation in the Goto.com marketplace by our
advertisers, network affiliate sites and loyal users clearly
demonstrates the need for our service and our success in delivering
it,'' Jeffrey Brewer, the company's chief executive, said in a
statement. Stock of Goto.com, which went public at $15, rose more
than 18 percent, to $28 a share, the day of the announcement.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, the stock soared $8.50 more after the company
announced a strategic partnership with the Netscape Communications
Corp.. In both cases, the company issued statements to the press.
An official for the company said he could not comment on the
stock's price, which is now triple its offering price at $48.9375,
because he was bound by the quiet period surrounding the offering.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Harmon, senior investment analyst for Internet.com., sees
no problem with Goto's action. ``If you are an investor, I think
you want to know those numbers,'' he said. ``I think that's
newsworthy.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Network Plus, he said that a stock recommendation by the
company's underwriter should be taken with a grain of salt since it
was biased and that its timing, whether days or months later,
should make no difference to investors.
</P>
<P>
   Another case in point is Stamps.com, an online postage company,
which went public for $11 a share on June 25. Six days later, the
Mysoftware Co., a direct marketer, announced a partnership with
Stamps.com. ``Partnering with a high-caliber company serving small
business such as Mysoftware Co. is a phenomenal way for the
Stamps.com service to reach the small-business market,'' John
Payne, the chief executive of Stamps.com, said in a statement.
Stamps.com's stock climbed 50 percent, or $11.25, to $33.50, the
next day and closed Friday just under that level.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's absolutely a standard announcement,'' said Jeffrey Green,
the co-founder of the company and vice president of marketing.
``We've shown a clear history of making these types of
announcements.''
</P>
<P>
   Three announcements in quick succession led to a near tripling
of the stock price of Digital Island, which provides network
services. The day after its public offering of $10 a share on June
29, the company announced that it had secured Paymentnet Inc., a
payment processing service, as a customer. Digital Island's stock
promptly rose $6.0625, to $17.9375. Digital Island next announced a
deal to distribute content to Bidcom, an Internet resource for
builders. The stock gained $11.4375, to close at $32.6875 on
Tuesday after that news. Then Webspective Software announced a
partnership with Digital Island, which pushed Digital's stock up
$1.0625, to $33.75, on Wednesday. The shares closed the week at
$26.25.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Digital Island said Friday that legal advisers
had told him not to comment on the stock's movement because of the
quiet period. Heine of the SEC said regulators would not comment on
the actions of specific companies.
</P>
<P>
   Keith E. Benjamin, managing director and senior Internet analyst
at BancBoston Robertson Stephens, said the number of announcements
around initial ublic offerings could be traced to the heavy volume
of Internet stock issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are too many of them,'' Benjamin said. ``It's very
difficult to rise above the clutter. That requires big news.''
</P>
<P>
   Companies can find the quiet period exasperating. The executives
of Salon, an online magazine, have been the target of several
critics, including Michael Kinsley, the editor of a competing
online magazine, Slate. Kinsley wrote an April column saying that
the numbers in the company's SEC filing differed greatly from what
Salon's editor, David Talbot, had been telling the press. Salon,
though known for distributing provocative opinions, has chosen not
to respond because any comments could be construed as a violation
of the quiet period, Salon executives have said.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, though, Salon announced an E-commerce deal with
Culturefinder Inc., an arts information and ticketing Web site.
Shares of Salon gained $1.8125, to close that day at $12.75, up
from their $10.50 offering price of June 22.

$4.9 BILLION JURY VERDICT IN GM FUEL TANK CASE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: CORRECTS Gary to Greg in 4th graf.) 
(ATTN: Ariz., Fla.)  (rk) 
 By ANDREW POLLACK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In what is believed to be the largest award ever
in a personal-injury lawsuit, General Motors Corp. was ordered
Friday to pay $4.9 billion to six people severely burned when the
fuel tank of their 1979 Chevrolet Malibu exploded after a rear-end
collision.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict was reached by a 12-person jury in state court here
after a 10-week trial in which the accident victims had produced
some evidence purporting to show that General Motors had known the
car's design was unsafe but had not changed it because of the cost.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict, which included $107.6 million in compensatory
damages and $4.8 billion in punitive damages, is likely to raise
questions once again about whether jury verdicts in personal-injury
and product-liability cases have got out of hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an enormous, incredible windfall to whoever gets it,''
said Greg Keating, a law professor at the University of Southern
California, who said he could not recall another award of that
size. ``It turns the court system into a lottery.''
</P>
<P>
   But Keating, who said he is not a big critic of current court
procedures, said it was highly likely the verdict would be reduced
on appeal or that the parties would settle for a lesser amount. ``I
think it's true that the chance of this verdict surviving is almost
nonexistent,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But if the verdict were to stand, it would be a significant
burden for GM, which reported earnings of $3 billion from
continuing operations in 1998. Brian J. Panish, the lawyer for the
plaintiffs, said there are 30 to 60 other lawsuits involving
fuel-tank fires of the Malibu and other General Motors so-called
A-body cars, including the Pontiac Grand Am, the Oldsmobile Cutlass
and the Chevrolet Monte Carlo, which have a similar fuel-tank
design. Last year, a jury in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., awarded a
family $60 million after an accident in which the fuel tank of a
Cutlass exploded, killing two people and burning four others.
 &UR;  &LR; Patricia Anderson, her four children and a family friend, Jo
Tigner, were driving home from church in Los Angeles on Christmas
Eve in 1993 when she slowed to stop at a red light and a drunken
driver plowed into their car from behind at what the plaintiffs'
lawyers said was 50 miles per hour and General Motors says was 70
miles per hour. The people in the Malibu suffered severe burns.
Mrs. Anderson's daughter Alisha Parker, now 11, was horribly
disfigured on her face and lost her right hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``The jurors wanted to send a message to General Motors that
human life is more important than profits,'' Panish, the lawyers
for the accident victims, said.
</P>
<P>
   Panish said that the gas tank on the 1979 Malibu was only 11
inches from the rear bumper while in some prior year models it had
been more than 20 inches away. He said the testimony presented
during the trial showed that it would have cost General Motors
$8.59 per vehicle for a safer design but that the company had
decided it would be cheaper to settle any lawsuits that arose.
</P>
<P>
   One key piece of evidence, he said, was a memo written by an
Oldsmobile engineer named Edward Ivey in 1973 in which he estimated
that fuel tank fires were costing General Motors only $2.40 per
vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   General Motors, in a statement, maintained that the car's fuel
tank was safe and met or exceeded federal standards. ``This
extremely severe crash was caused by a single factor _ drunken
driving,'' the company said. It said it would appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Richard W. Shapiro, a Phoenix attorney who represented the
automaker, said the verdict was ``shocking'' and noted that the
jury had not been allowed to hear evidence that the driver of the
other car was drunk and went to jail. He also said the company had
been barred by the judge. Ernest G. Williams of Los Angeles County
Superior Court, from presenting evidence showing the safety history
of the vehicle and also from presenting crash-test data showing
that the car's design was safer than the one the plaintiffs
advocated.
</P>
<P>
   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has conducted
two safety investigations into the Malibu since the 1970s but
neither involved the fuel system, said Timothy Hurd, a spokesman
for the agency. He said the agency had recently notified automakers
that it was reviewing whether to tighten its rules on protecting
fuel systems but that this was unrelated to the Los Angeles case.
</P>
<P>
   But Joan B. Claybrook, who was the administrator of the highway
safety administration during the Carter administration, said Friday
that big verdicts in personal injury lawsuits were sometimes the
first signal to regulators that a safety problem existed. ``Could
this car be a problem and NHTSA. not know about it?'' asked Ms.
Claybrook, who is now president of Public Citizen, a consumer
advocacy group. ``Absolutely.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ms. Claybrook said she first learned of problems with Ford
Pinto's gas tank and ordered a federal investigation after a $125
million personal injury verdict in 1977. That award, and another
big one involving the Pinto fuel tank, was subsequently reduced
substantially. But the Pinto was later recalled because of the fuel
tank problem.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Hoar, an adviser to plaintiffs' lawyers in many lawsuits
against auto companies, including this case, said the verdict was
the largest ever in a personal injury case. He said the plaintiffs
might have been particularly successful because they presented
evidence that General Motors had lobbied in the early 1970s against
tougher standards for protecting fuel systems in crashes.
</P>
<P>
   Other lawyers said that the size and wealth of General Motors,
the nation's largest company, were taken into account by the jurors
in deciding on the size of the punitive damages.
</P>
<P>
   Jurors told reporters that that they felt the company had valued
human life too lightly. ``We're just like numbers I feel to them,
statistics,'' one juror, Carl Vangelisti, told Reuters. ``That's
something that is wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Anderson, the plaintiff said, ``I'm just glad that justice
was done.'' She said she was relieved, too, that the court decided
that General Motors was at fault. ``I have always blamed myself for
this,'' she said ``I couldn't give my children an explanation'' for
what happened to them.

   SINTRA, Portugal _ It started with a bullfight and ended with
investment bankers and fashion designers skinny-dipping in the
hotel pool.
</P>
<P>
   In between, statuesque women wrapped in pashmina shawls teetered
in Manolo Blahniks on the cobblestone streets of this coastal city
built by Portuguese kings and queens for their summer palaces.
</P>
<P>
   There were ponies with hydrangeas woven into their manes,
flamenco dancing, a series of all-night parties and bottles of
Chateau Lafite brought by members of the Rothschild family from
their own vineyards.
</P>
<P>
   Those were some of the highlights when John Josephson, 37, an
investment banker, and Carolina Zapf, 30, a dress designer, invited
220 of their nearest and dearest to cross the Atlantic Ocean to
their wedding, a five-day fandango over the Fourth of July weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The couple, both New Yorkers, have no family in Portugal, nor
have they ever lived there; they wanted an exotic location, and in
this day of casual jet travel and a galloping economy, the
extravagance of going to Europe for a wedding did not seem
far-fetched. A number of guests, including the bridegroom, who
specializes in movie-industry deals, were traveling from Portugal
to Sun Valley, Idaho, for the conference of media and entertainment
chieftains given by Allen &AMP; Co., the investment firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who wants to go to another wedding at the Pierre?'' said
Josephson, whose mother, Arlette Brisson, wore a James Galanos
gown, a gift from the designer, to the ceremony, and changed three
times during the 12-hour reception.
</P>
<P>
   This is the summer of the European wedding for certain New
Yorkers willing to pay a minimum of $100,000 for a multi-day
splurge for hundreds of guests. At a chateau near Paris over the
Memorial Day weekend, Nathalie Gerschel, a special events
coordinator at Christie's, wed Edward Kaplan, an executive at
Showtime Networks, before 400 friends.
</P>
<P>
   In June, Jamie Saslow, a former retail sales consultant, and
David Mitchell, an investment banker, were married in the Spanish
Synagogue in the historic Jewish Ghetto in Venice with 160 guests,
who were transported to nine events in four days, requiring two
party planners from Milan.

<P>
   Also over Fourth of July weekend, Cynthia Kaufman, who used to
work in sales at Donna Karan, and Henry Gabay, an investment
banker, were married before 350 in Istanbul, Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   Jill Swid, an editor at Mirabella magazine, had to choose
between the Istanbul wedding and the one in Portugal. ``Cynthia is
one of my closest friends,'' she said. That sealed her decision to
go to Istanbul, where festivities began at an open-air nightclub on
Wednesday and peaked at the Saturday ceremony in a restored Ottoman
palace overlooking the Bosporus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't figured out why there is the European wedding
craze,'' Ms. Swid said, ``but there is. Europeans say, `Our
weddings last for days.' But there can be three-day weddings in New
York or Southampton. The difference is you're on holiday, I
guess.''
</P>
<P>
   Polly Onet, an event planner, who last year organized a wedding
for New Yorkers in Dublin, says the economy has a lot to do with
the trend. But she added, ``I think people in high society get very
bored. In order to challenge them and make things very special and
spectacular, it takes bringing them to a completely new environment
in order to blow their minds.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of those marrying or receiving invitations, invariably
accompanied by pages of travel instructions, belong to the loosely
interlocking worlds of charity parties, investment banking and
fashion.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of these people are on the same wedding circuit,'' noted
Alexandra Kotur, an editor at Vogue, who has been to three weddings
of New Yorkers this summer in Europe. The grandest joined Valesca
Dost and Mathias Guerrand-Hermes, an heir to the French fashion
house, who lives in New York. The wedding started with more than
450 guests on May 12 in Paris and ended five days later in
Marrakech, Morocco, with guests transported by two private jets.
</P>
<P>
   Alexandra Lind, a fashion designer, went to the Kaufman-Gabay
wedding in Istanbul, the Gerschel-Kaplan wedding in Paris (she
designed the blue satin dresses for the bridesmaids), and plans to
attend a wedding over Labor Day weekend for Victoria Scaravilli, a
Manhattan real estate agent and Owen Colligan, an investment
banker, in Capri, Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Colligan and Ms. Scaravilli were themselves at the Portugal
wedding. ``When I told my family we were getting married in Capri,
they thought we were nuts,'' Colligan said, as he ate wedding cake
at 1:30 a.m. in the Palacio de Seteais, an 18th-century
palace-turned-hotel, where the reception was held.
</P>
<P>
   ``And Princess Di over there,'' he said ``wants 12 bridesmaids.
So, I had to find 12 ushers who will go with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Katrina Pavlos, a guest in Portugal, who has been invited to
four European weddings this summer, cried out, ``Please, stop, I
can't afford it!''
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I have to go to all of them,'' said Ms. Pavlos,
26, a filmmaker, as she sipped Champagne. ``They're your friends.
But I'm broke by now.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Onet estimated that the weddings cost the hosts, who often
fly in their own bands and a minister or rabbi to officiate,
anywhere from $100,000 to several million. This contrasts with a
wedding at the Pierre Hotel in New York, which for 200 can run
about $125,000 and up, including flowers, photographers, tips and
taxes, said Arthur Backal, the director of catering at the hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Guests invited to the Portugal wedding, who paid their own air
fare and lodging, said they spent from $2,500 to $4,000, not
including a gift, numerous clothing changes (during the wedding
reception alone, many of the women changed several times, moving
from cocktail dresses to ball gowns) and, in some cases, the
expense of a nanny brought from home.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Onet said that there is an element of one-upmanship in the
weddings. ``By having an extremely over-the-top, lavish event
abroad, people want to impress, make a statement and outshine the
last party,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The 1990s jet-set wedding may have been sparked by the
well-publicized foreign ceremonies of two daughters of the
billionaire Robert Miller. In 1993, Pia Miller married Christopher
Getty in Bali, where Balinese carried the couple on thrones. Three
years later, Marie-Chantal Miller married Crown Prince Pavlos of
Greece in England before 1,100 guests; Valentino designed 27
dresses for the bridal party, and Barry Diller flew in the wedding
cake on his private plane.
</P>
<P>
   Darcy Miller, the weddings editor for Martha Stewart Weddings
magazine (not one of those Miller sisters), said, ``Since the
magazine started in 1995, we've seen so many more destination
weddings, which is going somewhere for your wedding where you do
not live and no one else lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Some couples marry abroad, Ms. Miller said, as a way of paring
down the guest list without bruising feelings. They expect the
travel expense will deter all but their closest and most affluent
friends. But they find out, she said, that people love to travel.
More than 70 percent of those invited showed up for the
Josephson-Zapf wedding.
</P>
<P>
   ``I turn my head and a new person I didn't know was coming
arrives,'' Ms. Zapf said the day before the ceremony, wearing navy
jodhpurs and a white shirt on the terrace of her hotel. She
shrugged. ``I don't know who else is going to show up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to think about it,'' she said, and went off
horseback riding to relax.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The partying never stops. David Schulhof, 28, a lawyer at
Miramax Films, who attended the Gerschel-Kaplan wedding, said that
on the first night there was a cocktail party on a bateau-mouche on
the Seine.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the evening we raged at different nightclubs,'' he said.
``We went to Les Bains Douches, Bar Fly and Le Cabaret.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though Guerrand-Hermes, whose family is French, could claim
he was returning home to be married outside Paris in mid-May, and
thus his wedding was not such an extravagance, the event was the
most lavish this season. New Yorkers were invited in droves.
</P>
<P>
   On the first night, guests were instructed to wear stiletto
heels and slicked-back hair to a flamenco-themed party. The wedding
the next day took place on an Hermes estate in Chantilly, where a
New England-style church had been constructed for the ceremony.
Then, guests were flown by private planes to Marrakech. Over the
next three days, there were a party in the gardens of Yves Saint
Laurent's home, and polo on camelback.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone felt like a pasha, it was from another era,'' said
Kristina Stewart, the editor in chief of Quest magazine, who
attended. On the second-to-last night, she said she told the
bridegroom, ``If you want to outdo yourself you're going to have to
come up with a Kelly bag for every guest and a virgin sacrifice
tomorrow night.'' There were no Kelly bags, but guests were sent
home with a custom-made Hermes scarf.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the Josephson-Zapf fete in Sintra was more modest.
The guests, a high quotient of Internet entrepreneurs, including
Jon Diamond, the chairman of CDNow, the online music retailer, and
David Wetherell, the chairman of the venture capital company CMGI,
which just before he flew in had paid $2.03 billion for control of
the Web search engine Alta Vista. The front-desk manager of the
converted castle where many guests stayed received daily piles of
faxes in advance with all sorts of special requests, including one
for a T1 high-speed data line. (He had no idea what it was.)
</P>
<P>
   Yet, what celebrants repeatedly praised as the charm of a
multi-day wedding in Portugal was the way busy, competitive people
let down their guard. The social angling familiar to many from
weekends in the Hamptons was largely absent. ``If you take people
out of their element, it works,'' Josephson said.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon R. Pennington, a marketing strategist, surveyed the
guests dancing in a garden the night before the wedding and said:
``Half these people wouldn't talk to each other if they were
sitting in the Hamptons. When you take them out of the country, in
a place they've never been to, it takes their edge off.''
</P>
<P>
   At 2:30 a.m. the following night, Bradley Lander's eyes were
barely open, but he was unwilling to call it quits. ``When are you
going to be playing in Sintra again?'' he said, and got up to
dance, missing a few steps, with a scantily clad woman who tossed
her lime-green shawl in the grass to join him.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, at cocktails, another man had said, ``It's chic to say
you went to Portugal for the weekend.'' Moments before he was
joined by his date, whom he had escorted from New York, he added,
``It's a great way to impress a girl and take her on a test drive
at the same time.''

`GO-GO' BRINGING CHINA TO HEIGHTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHIRA SPRINGER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ The Rose Bowl videoboard flashed images from
Beijing, Shanghai, and the Forbidden City as Team China practiced
Friday. The street scenes, rice paddie workers, bicycling
citizenry, Asian architecture, and Great Wall are drawn from a
palette of muted greens, grays, and browns. Remnants of the
1,000-year rule by dynastic emperors and the visage of Chairman Mao
Zedong set against a red background provide brief,
far-from-brilliant flashes of color. Even without narration, the
tone of the montage appears subdued.
</P>
<P>
   The big screen set high atop the stadium falls directly in line
with the north-end goal, where starting Chinese keeper Gao Hong
faced shots from her teammates. Wearing fluorescent green gloves
and a shirt dyed in fluorescent orange and bright purple, the
player between the posts clashes with the more traditional Chinese
images played above.
</P>
<P>
   All tournament long, Gao has colored the Chinese story.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she's just so excited about life,'' said American
forward Tiffeny Milbrett, who has maintained ``international
friendship'' with Gao over the past four years. ``She's just a
happy person. She's really curious. I think she's more curious than
the other Chinese players and that leads me to believe she's a
little bit more outgoing.''
</P>
<P>
   Added US goalie Briana Scurry: ``She's always smiling. You score
a goal. She smiles. She makes a save. She smiles.''
</P>
<P>
   Gao is the exuberant face of a squad that has surprised many
with its openess, embracing all a World Cup set on American soil
has to offer a player who grew up during Chairman Mao's Cultural
Revolution in the eastern city of Taizhou. The 31-year-old Gao and
32-year-old midfielder Liu Ailing are the oldest players on the
team, but Gao would rather make her teammates laugh at every
opportunity than act her age.
</P>
<P>
   And once retirement comes, she hopes to return to California as
a graduate student. The former point guard and textile worker has
learned to make the most out of life's opportunities and savor the
best moments.
</P>
<P>
   After practice, the Chinese players hustled to a bus waiting
nearby. They left quickly to keep the rigid schedule set by their
coach Ma Yuanan. But goalie Gao lingered as long as she could,
standing happily in the sun with her sleeves rolled up, taking in
the size of the stadium, delighting in the number of reporters
present. Then Gao collected her gear and headed for the bus. ``See
you tomorrow,'' she said, waving and smiling at a crowd of
photographers and cameramen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go-go will have a better performance when there are many
people around her,'' Ma said of his goalie.
</P>
<P>
   Leaping high to punch away passes that cross through the penalty
areas, her acrobatic style complements her personality. Gao plays
goal with a rare combination of flamboyance and technically-sound
flair.
</P>
<P>
   She leads all World Cup keepers in the two most significant
statistical categories. Gao has allowed just two goals this
tournament _ one each to Sweden and Australia in first-round play.
Her perfect record through the quarterfinals and semifinals lowered
her goals against average to 0.4. Saturday's final against the US
and counterpart Scurry, who regularly vies for title of world's
best female keeper, will provide her grandest stage. Chinese coach
Ma Yuanan has no doubt Gao will put on a show.
</P>
<P>
   US coach Tony DiCicco knows firsthand the heights Gao's talent
can reach. She assisted him at a Nike camp last summer. Yet, he
chose not to provide insight into the best way to score against
Gao, keeping his evaluation of her talent vague and putting his
praise behind Scurry.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's really a neat person, she's a great personality, and
she's an outstanding goalkeeper,'' he said. ``She has some
weaknesses and we're hoping to expose those (Saturday). She can
also make some great saves. So, we've got to be patient,
persistent, and take our chances well. Gao is a good goalkeeper and
a lovely lady, but Briana Scurry is the best goalkeeper in the
World Cup and, I think, in the world. We have an edge in goal.''
</P>
<P>
   Gao's faith rests in her devout Christian beliefs. Her religion
_ kept by one percent of the population in a country that
officially considers itself atheist _ also sets the goalie apart.
She gives credit to God for her play and views her World Cup
experience as a divine gift.
</P>
<P>
   But Gao has provided tournament color all by herself with the
force of her personality. If the American forwards test her
Saturday, Gao's unique, acrobatic artistry might result in a final
golden masterpiece.

GOP TRYING TO PREVENT THIRD-PARTY CANDIDACIES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ind., Iowa, N.C., N.H., Texas) (th) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Republican Party leaders meeting here said Friday
they were distressed, even alarmed, that conservative contenders
for the presidential nomination might mount third-party candidacies
to protest the party establishment's embrace of Gov. George W. Bush
of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   But just as party officials gathered behind closed doors at the
Republican Party's summer convention to discuss whether to call on
candidates to pledge that they would not defect, advisers to Sen.
Robert Smith of New Hampshire said he would announce on Tuesday his
intention to run as a third-party candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Even before Smith's decision was known, several party leaders
expressed concerns that any renegade who abandoned the field could
siphon precious votes from the Republican nominee in November 2000.
In interviews, they said they were deeply worried despite the fact
that Smith and others who are said to be considering third-party
candidacies _ Gary L. Bauer, the former head of the Family Research
Council, and Pat Buchanan, the conservative commentator _ are
barely registering in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of third-party candidacies has gained currency in
recent weeks among conservatives who contend that Bush, as well as
party leaders in Washington, are not sufficiently conservative on
issues like abortion, taxes and gun control. They have also
expressed frustration that no champion has emerged from the right
to take on Bush, even though several devoted conservatives are in
the race.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are eyeing running as members of the U.S. Taxpayer
Party or the Reform Party of Ross Perot.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Nicholson, the party's national chairman, had been expected
Friday to raise with party officials the possibility of calling on
Republican candidates to pledge not to run on a third-party ticket
if they lose the nomination. But since it would be too late in the
case of Smith, party officials said they would put off such a
discussion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would look silly,'' said Clifford D. May, the party's
communications director.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Nicholson denounced Smith's plans and implored him to
reconsider, saying, ``It would be tragic for your decades of work
in the conservative movement to be undone by a short-sighted
decision whose only negligible impact would be to provide marginal
help to Al Gore, the most extreme liberal in a generation.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Duprey, chairman of the New Hampshire Republican Party,
was particularly harsh, saying of Smith, ``This is a selfish move,
and it is doomed to failure. It signals the end of his political
career in New Hampshire.''
</P>
<P>
   Duprey and his counterpart in Iowa, Kayne Robinson, had planned
to send a letter on Monday to every candidate seeking their written
pledge not to run as a third-party candidate. The moves by those
chairmen are important because Iowa and New Hampshire hold the
first crucial primary contests.
</P>
<P>
   But Duprey and Robinson put off their letter after other party
officials cautioned them at a private meeting Friday that the
effort might be too heavy-handed. Duprey said the sentiment of
other party leaders was, ``Do we want to get in the business of
drawing hard lines?''
</P>
<P>
   In interviews here before word surfaced about Smith, many party
leaders said they believed that Perot's candidacy in 1992
diminished President George Bush's chance for re-election _ and
they fear a repeat from a Republican who runs on a third-party
ticket.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every Republican is concerned with a potential third-party
candidacy,'' said Dee Stewart, executive director of the Iowa
Republican Party. ``It could do nothing but hurt us.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael McDaniel, chairman of the Indiana Republican Party, said
the party should do whatever it could to satisfy candidates who
threatened to bolt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look,'' McDaniel said, ``these folks are important to our base
and we should do things to keep them in the fold. It's
counterproductive to be in a situation that would jeopardize our
chances.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of the wide support here for Bush, he said, ``The
groundswell is so big that small splinters may not have the effect
they would have'' if the party was more divided over a nominee.
But, he added, ``it's better not to have any splinters.''
</P>
<P>
   Duprey also said it would be a mistake to play down the threat
from runaway candidates, asserting, ``To say, `I'm going to pick up
my marbles and leave' _ that's flat out unacceptable. If the
nomination doesn't work out, you shouldn't be a sore loser.''
</P>
<P>
   He later said Smith would never have won re-election to a second
term had it not been for help from the state and national parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob is also wrong when he says his party has given up its
views on defense, gun control, taxes, trade, the importance of
human life _ or any other issue,'' he said. ``All of our candidates
are good Republicans.''
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Smith, the first Republican to announce this year that
he was running for president, said he would have no comment until
he declared his intentions on the floor of the Senate on Tuesday.
But in a recent interview, Smith expressed frustration with his
party, saying, ``Right now we have one political party in America.
It's run by moderate Democrats and moderate Republicans, and
conservatives are stuck.''
</P>
<P>
   He said then that he would create his own party or seek to run
as a member of the Reform or U.S. Taxpayers Party. Friday, Smith's
advisers said he had made no decision about which party he would
favor. But they said the Reform Party was the least likely option.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Smith's earlier threats about bolting the party, some
Republicans here were caught off guard by his decision. Hours
before word seeped out, many Republicans scoffed at the notion that
Smith might leave the fold.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not worried,'' said Betsy DeVos, the chairwoman from
Michigan. ``Republicans are so determined to take back the White
House.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferrell Blount, the national committeeman from North Carolina,
was also adamant, saying, ``Bob Smith is a Republican and we're the
big-tent party. There might be some banter back and forth on the
stump. But this is the most unified Republican Party that I have
ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the intraparty debate, Republicans did take the
opportunity at their gathering in Philadelphia to focus on the
Democrats. Instead of lambasting the president, Nicholson set his
sites on Gore, former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey, who is
challenging Gore, and a new target: Hillary Rodham Clinton, who is
considering a race for the Senate from New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``She says she's being drafted,'' Nicholson said. ``Well, if she
is, she's the only Clinton I know to ever answer the draft.'' The
audience roared its approval.

 By DON VAN NATTA Jr.    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With calls to ``pillory Hillary,'' conservative and
Republican organizations are mobilizing to raise millions of
dollars all over the country in an effort to crush Hillary Rodham
Clinton's all-but-certain Senate candidacy in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton has long been an object of scorn for large numbers
of conservative groups, all the more so since she attributed the
investigation of the Monica Lewinsky scandal to a ``vast right-wing
conspiracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Now her expected bid for public office has inspired fierce
opposition and a flow of checks from conservatives in far-flung
places like Alabama and New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the groups behind this effort are hoping to expand
their own donor base as well as raise money that they say they will
spend to prevent Mrs. Clinton from becoming the next senator from
New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to take more than a village to defeat Hillary
Clinton,'' Winton Blount III, chairman of the Alabama Republican
Party, wrote in asking 10,000 donors for checks of $50 or $100, to
be spent on a Senate election more than 1,000 miles away. Other
groups are mailing similar letters.
</P>
<P>
   It is not the prospect of achieving victory for Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani, or any other Republican candidate, that is inspiring the
leaders of these organizations. They say their goal is simply to
keep Mrs. Clinton out of the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's less motivated by the Republican we want to win _ it's
motivated by preventing her to be elected to the United States
Senate,'' said Craig Shirley, a conservative Republican consultant
who helped organize Conservatives for Effective Leadership, a
political action committee formed here last month with the goal of
raising $10 million to pay for advertisements against Mrs. Clinton
in New York State next year.
</P>
<P>
   New York Republicans had mixed reactions to the outside efforts
against Mrs. Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very pleased to have organizations outside New York
looking to defeat Hillary Clinton,'' said Dan Allen, a spokesman
for the state party. ``We feel she is only coming up here to run
for president in 2004.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Teitelbaum, director of Giuliani's exploratory committee,
said the mayor would attend fund-raisers in Alabama later this
month for his Senate campaign, but sought to distance Giuliani from
the anti-Clinton fund-raising drives.
</P>
<P>
   ``What other groups are doing, and state parties are doing, in
respect to raising money, it's not something we're connected to,''
Teitelbaum said.
</P>
<P>
   One Republican strategist involved in the Senate race in New
York doubted that the contributions aimed at defeating Mrs. Clinton
would benefit her Republican opponent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see it as a tremendous benefit to any candidate,''
this strategist said. ``This is what the Republicans did with Ted
Kennedy and the Democrats did with Newt Gingrich. Every
fund-raising group in the world loves a bogyman.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard Wolfson, the spokesman for Mrs. Clinton's exploratory
committee, declined to comment on the conservative groups' efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Shirley's PAC, raising money from across the country, was
created, its literature says, to ``educate voters about unqualified
candidates.'' But Shirley confirmed that it would devote all its
energies in the next year and a half to the effort to defeat one
candidate: Mrs. Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a fund-raising standpoint, anyone on the right who
doesn't target Hillary is a fool,'' Shirley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I run just one cell of the vast right-wing conspiracy,'' he
said. ``The sophistry that she was selling when she coined that
phrase was that Monica was part of some right-wing conspiracy, that
we had put her up to stalking the president. Of course, that wasn't
true.''
</P>
<P>
   Some groups started raising money against Mrs. Clinton weeks
before she began her ``listening tour'' in New York on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured that a lot of the Clinton haters would come out of
the woodwork,'' said Charles Lewis, founder and executive director
of the Center for Public Integrity, a campaign finance watchdog.
``I just thought it would take a few more weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   It is unlikely that all the money netted by the anti-Clinton
appeals will really be spent in New York; various conservative
groups have long used President Clinton and his wife as
fund-raising targets. But whatever is spent in New York will only
add to what already appears virtually certain to be the most
expensive Senate race in history.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's supporters hope to raise $25 million for her
campaign, and her most likely Republican opponent, Giuliani, hopes
to raise an equal amount. If other organizations, like the
Democratic and Republican national committees, make good on their
promise to spend millions on issue advertisements, the race could
end up costing $100 million, political strategists say.
</P>
<P>
   Fund-raising strategists say that the anti-Hillary fervor of the
Republican organizations demonstrates that Mrs. Clinton has already
assumed her husband's role as a magnet for checks when her name is
cited in conservative fund-raising letters.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican National Committee mentioned Mrs. Clinton's
health care policies in recent written and telephone solicitations
for cash. ``It has been a huge success,'' said Clifford D. May, the
committee's communications director. ``There is no question that
Hillary Clinton and her policies energize the Republican activists.
She is a polarizing figure.''
</P>
<P>
   Following Alabama's lead, the New Hampshire Republican Party
will also ask 10,000 New Hampshire Republicans to contribute money
to defeat Mrs. Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had eight years of Clinton-Gore,'' said Steve Duprey,
the party chairman. ``Why would we let yet another Clinton do it in
the United States Senate? I predict it will be one of our most
effective fund-raising letters. She is a figure that energizes the
Republican base.''
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   Gary Nolan, a nationally syndicated radio talk show host, said
he had always assumed that Mrs. Clinton would not run, because
``she has too much to lose.'' But after it became clear in late May
that she almost certainly would run, Nolan quickly helped found
Conservatives for Effective Leadership, the PAC that Shirley also
had a hand in creating.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago Nolan, whose literature calls on supporters to
help ``pillory Hillary,'' sent 40,000 letters to conservatives
around the country. In an interview, he declined to say how much
had already been raised, describing the response only as ``huge.''
His solicitation letter promised ``television commercials,
newspaper ads, voter guides, media packets ... there's nothing we
won't do to keep Hillary out of office.''
</P>
<P>
   Blount, the Alabama Republican chairman, said he had challenged
other state party leaders to raise money to spend on anti-Clinton
advertisements in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Already the Alabama letter has raised tens of thousands of
dollars, party officials said. And Blount said he planned to
deliver that money personally to Republican leaders in New York. He
also said Mrs. Clinton clearly hoped to use a Senate seat as a
launching pad to return to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just imagine four years from now _ `Hillary for President,'''
Blount wrote. ``Scary, isn't it?''

 &HT;    Slaying suspect lured girls to his house
 &HT;    By Tom Beyerlein and Steve Bennish
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Just days before three teen-age Sidney girls were
killed in Thursday's bloody rampage, one of the girls told her
mother that the man now suspected of killing the girls had been
luring them to his house, offering to pay them cash to watch him
masturbate, the mother said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Cheryl L. Cai, mother of victim Sherry Kimbler, said she
believes Lawrence Michael ``Mike'' Hensley, who remained at large
Friday night, killed the girls _ in a spree that also left a man
dead and a woman critically wounded _ because he feared his sex
secrets were close to being revealed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he had an idea that people were getting on to him,''
said Cai, 35, who lives just across from Hensley's home, where the
three girls were killed. ``I think he had it set up and planned to
kill them.''
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Dean Kimpel, operations chief for the Sidney police, said
that theory ``is something we're looking at.'' Police also are
investigating the possibility Hensley, 30, is part of a Satanic
cult, Kimpel said. But authorities are not close to determining a
motive, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The dead girls are Sherry Kimbler, 16; Sherry's cousin Tosha L.
Barrett, also 16; and Amy Mikesell, 14, described by Cai as
Sherry's best friend. Veronica Eagy, 22, of Russells Point, was
wounded by multiple shotgun wounds but crawled out a basement
window in Hensley's residence to summon help about 5:16 p.m.
Thursday. She is in critical condition and under guard at Miami
Valley Hospital, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Brett Roy Wildermuth, 37, was killed at his home outside Sidney
about 20 minutes after the teens' deaths were discovered.
</P>
<P>
   Wildermuth, a member of First Church of God where the Hensleys
also attended services, had been praying with Hensley immediately
before he was killed, according to the victim's pastor. The pastor,
Ben Davis, said Hensley had phoned Davis, Wildermuth and other
church members before he left home. ``He called a number of church
members trying to find someone to pray with'' before he found
Wildermuth, Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   Kimpel said the bodies of Sherry and Tosha were found in a
bedroom on the main floor of the home. They suffered multiple
wounds from a short-barreled shotgun, according to an arrest
warrant. A shotgun had been fired in that bedroom, Kimpel said.
</P>
<P>
   Eagy's assailant apparently left her for dead, Kimpel said. She
broke out a basement window and crawled into the yard. Two teen-age
boys saw her and ran to the nearby home of a police officer.
</P>
<P>
   The stabbed body of Amy Mikesell was not found until about 10:30
p.m., Kimpel said, and her killer apparently purposely concealed
her in the basement.
</P>
<P>
   ``All three of those girls could have been models _ pretty,
petite,'' said Sherry's uncle, Bill Richards. ``This is like a slap
in the face.''
</P>
<P>
   Police hauled a truckload of potential evidence from Hensley's
home. In the garage Thursday night, they found 24 Molotov cocktails
_ empty 12-ounce beer bottles recently filled with a flammable
liquid and stuffed with rags as wicks _ Kimpel said. They were
destroyed Thursday night by a U.S. Army ordnance disposal unit.
</P>
<P>
   Kimpel said Amy may have been stabbed to death hours before the
shootings. After the shootings, Julie Hensley, the suspect's wife
since April, came home and the couple drove to Wildermuth's home,
he said. Police believe Julie Hensley was unaware of the carnage in
the Queen Street home. No charges have been filed against her.
</P>
<P>
   Wildermuth, the father of three children younger than 10, was
killed by a large handgun, according to arrest warrants. His wife
and children were not home. After the shooting, police said, Julie
Hensley went for help, and her husband drove away in her car,
leaving her behind.
</P>
<P>
   A 17-year-old neighbor and former baby sitter for the
Wildermuths said her mother overheard Julie Hensley tell police
that ``it was after he finished praying that he shot Brett.''
</P>
<P>
   Hensley has a history of public indecency convictions, and
frequently sought psychological counseling because of his history
of indecent exposure, according to Sidney police records.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I have a sexual disorder problem and I know I need
help,'' he told Sidney police detectives investigating an earlier
indecent exposure case. ``Some true, honest help. Someone that will
find out why I do this, because deep down I don't want to do
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Pastor Davis of First Church of God, where Hensley's bride is a
longtime member, said Hensley had been involved in devil worship,
but church members felt he was changing with Wildermuth's help.
</P>
<P>
   Police put out a nationwide bulletin to law enforcement
agencies, seeking Hensley's arrest. Police said Hensley is
5-foot-11 with a stocky build, a goatee, a shaved head and tattoos
on both forearms. He was last seen driving a purple, two-door
Chevrolet Cavalier bearing Ohio license ANQ-7879. Police filed
arrest warrants Friday in Shelby County Common Pleas charging
Hensley with four counts of aggravated murder. The warrants said
Hensley was last seen wearing a blue T-shirt and cap with
University of Kentucky emblems on them, blue-jean shorts and white
shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Kimpel said Hensley is considered heavily armed _ with at least
a shotgun, rifle and handgun _ and dangerous. He also has been
trained in the martial arts.
</P>
<P>
   Members of Hensley's family Friday said they were in shock by
the accusations against Hensley.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never think it would happen to your family,'' one Hensley
relative said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We regret the loss of the shooting victims and we are
sympathetic and they are in our prayers as well,'' a female family
member said.
</P>
<P>
   Sidney police had given the family no information and told them
to contact police if Hensley tries to reach them, family members
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody ever suspected this _ it was totally off the wall,'' a
woman who said she is ``indirectly related'' to Hensley said.
``It's very obvious he cracked, so obviously something was going
on. We may never know.''
</P>
<P>
   Cai, Sherry's mother, said someone at a Fourth of July party on
Sunday told her that Hensley was luring the girls to his home with
cash to watch him masturbate. Cai said she questioned her daughter,
who admitted Hensley paid $50 to $100 to her and other girls for
the favor.
</P>
<P>
   Sherry pleaded with Cai not to report Hensley to police, Cai
said, because Sherry feared reprisals. Cai said she didn't report
the incident after Sherry promised never to go back to Hensley's
house. ``We talked about it the last couple of days,'' Cai said.
She said she was still debating whether to report it when the
killings occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Cai said she heard what sounded like gunshots when she came home
for lunch about 1:30 p.m. She knocked on Hensley's door about 2
p.m. and asked Hensley if he had seen Sherry. He told her Sherry
had been to his house to use the phone, but left in a gray Cadillac
with a young man known to the family. Hensley also asked Cai to
come in for a drink, she said. She refused.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I said was, `Where's my daughter?' And he lied,'' Cai
said. When she looked into Hensley's eyes, ``I knew he knew (that)
I knew'' about the sexual favors, Cai said.
</P>
<P>
   She said a younger cousin of Sherry's later told her that
Hensley had recently offered $400 each to the three girls to meet
at his house for unspecified purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Tosha's aunt, Brenda Stiver, said Tosha had been living with her
for several months. Stiver said Tosha recently got a job ``and was
saving every dollar to get a car.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They weren't stupid girls, but they were naive, I guess you'd
say,'' said Cai's friend Georgia Fair of Sidney. ``I think little
Sherry told Hensley that her mom knew (about the sexual favors).''
</P>
<P>
   Amy Mikesell's mother, Rita, believes the teens, who've been
friends since the Mikesells moved from Florida to Sidney six months
ago, went to Hensley's house to use the phone because Sherry
Kimbler didn't have one.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, Rita Mikesell thought her daughter left one day early
to go to the four-day country concert in Fort Loramie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know fully that it was Amy till noon,'' she said.
``The lieutenant brought a picture of her.''
</P>
<P>
   Wildermuth's neighbors expressed shock at his slaying.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nobody in this world that's any nicer than those
people (the Wildermuths),'' Rosie Breen said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two days ago, (Brett) was out here teaching his little
5-year-old how to ride her bicycle. He said, 'Rosie, do you think
I'll ever teach her?' I said, 'Sure you will.''' She paused and
stared out at the spot in front of her home where Wildermuth had
been with his little girl. ``Well, he won't now,'' she said.

COLUMN: THE DIRT ON OFFICE BATHROOMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Wednesday, July 14)  
 (DW)  
 By DAVID GRIMES   Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you are a boss and you're wondering why your employees seem
to be suffering from low morale, it may not because of the low pay,
long hours or powerful electric shocks you send coursing through
their bodies every time they stand up to stretch.
</P>
<P>
   The reason might be that they're disgusted with the bathrooms.
According to a survey by Kimberly-Clark, 51 percent of employees
think their office bathroom is the sanitary equivalent of a
fish-market dumpster, only with a more offensive smell.
</P>
<P>
   The survey did not reveal what this means in terms of worker
productivity, but you've got to think the news is not good.
</P>
<P>
   A worker who is too afraid to use his or her office bathroom, no
matter how urgent the need, is a worker who is not devoting his
full attention to his work. Pressure of this sort not only leads to
mistakes, but also increases the number of sick and ``personal''
days taken off by the employee.
</P>
<P>
   An employee who is dancing around the office on one leg is an
employee who is not contributing to the company's bottom line, so
to speak. It is hard to concentrate on reports and spreadsheets
when bacteria the size of Shetland ponies are clomping about in the
company restroom down the hall.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible, if not likely, that most office disgruntlement
can be directly traced back to unsanitary bathrooms. Employee
complaints including the air conditioning being set too low or too
high, inadequate work space or outdated equipment could simply be a
way of crying out for a more liberal use of Sani-Flush.
</P>
<P>
   Some employers might argue that if they keep the bathrooms too
clean, employees will spend all day in there, coming out only long
enough to collect their pay checks and scarf up more coffee and
doughnuts. Judging by the survey, there is possibly some truth to
that.
</P>
<P>
   A surprising number of American workers would like to see their
office bathrooms converted into a sort of tiled, disinfected
home-entertainment center. Of those surveyed, 7 percent said they
would like phones, stereos and CD players installed in the john.
</P>
<P>
   Although I support almost every idea workers come up with to
torment their employer-oppressors, including Take Your Dog to Work
Day, I'm not sure how comfortable I'd be visiting the office
bathroom when the guy in the stall next to me is playing, at
porcelain-cracking volume, ``Cassie Eats Cockroaches'' Acid Bath on
the company-installed boom box.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to bring a newspaper or magazine into the bathroom
with you, that's fine, but please leave your KoRn and Punk-O-Rama
CDs at home or in the car.
</P>
<P>
   Even more disturbing is the opinion of 2 percent of respondents
that saunas should be installed in company restrooms.
</P>
<P>
   It seems to me that interpersonal relationships in the office
environment are dicey enough these days without encouraging people
to sit naked for long periods of time in a 200-degree box.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is so stupid that it could only have come from
management. Their thinking here, I presume, is that employees can
barely tolerate occupying the same building with one another let
alone sitting naked in a 200-degree box together, so saunas would
keep workers out of the company bathrooms even more effectively
than the old method, which was simply not to clean the place for
decades at a time.
</P>
<P>
   When you think of the alternatives, a little dirt might not be
such a bad thing.

STRAWBERRY   TRIES AGAIN   TO RETURN   TO YANKEES  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By DOUG FERNANDES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. _ At 8:42 Friday morning, Darryl Strawberry entered
the Yankees' minor league complex in a silver Ford Expedition.
</P>
<P>
   The choice of vehicle seemed appropriate, because Friday
signaled the beginning of Strawberry's journey back into baseball.
It was his first workout at a team facility since he was arrested
April 14 on charges of cocaine possession and solicitation of a
prostitute, charges to which he pleaded no contest six weeks later.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in workout clothes, Strawberry, 37, was greeted by a
handful of reporters. For about 15 minutes, before he embarked on a
workout that was closed to reporters and the public, Strawberry
stood and talked about himself, his arrest and his feelings of
remorse.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry said his troubles this spring stemmed from
depression. Still recovering from treatment for colon cancer,
Strawberry was not among the outfielders the Yankees included on
their major league roster at the end of spring training and was
left behind in Tampa to continue working into shape.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really psychologically went through some different changes
of being out in the heat, trying to prove myself and putting extra
pressure on myself,'' Strawberry said. ``When I didn't make the
ball club, it put more pressure on me and I really fell into a real
deep depression. I wasn't mad at anyone. I was mad at myself more
than anything.''
</P>
<P>
   He said it was during this period that he began drinking again
and ``slacked off'' on attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have a tendency to come down on athletes, but we have
people in very high positions that go through the same struggles I
do with my alcoholism,'' Strawberry said. ``I'm clean and sober
today, and that's the most important thing. I want to continue to
stay that way. I'm back on the right track.''
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry also used the interview to apologize to George
Steinbrenner ``for any pain and shame that I caused to him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's done so many great things for me,'' Strawberry said. He
said he had spoken with Steinbrenner and that the principal owner
``basically told me that I let him down.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He felt that I had a great deal of pressure on my back,
fighting through the cancer and chemo,'' Strawberry said. ``He
realized all the things that I've been trying to overcome was a
world of pressure on me. I just told him how bad I felt as a
person.''
</P>
<P>
   In the workout itself, Strawberry did some stretching and
running, shagged fly balls and spent about 15 minutes taking
batting practice. He reportedly hit more than a dozen pitches over
the fence before heading off to the weight room.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry is under a 120-day suspension imposed by Commissioner
Bud Selig, retroactive to his arrest. That means he could be
eligible to play again for the Yankees on Aug. 12, but Selig will
review the suspension on July 22 and may lift the suspension at
that point.
</P>
<P>
   Yankees manager Joe Torre has suggested that Strawberry will
need several weeks of game action in the minor leagues before the
Yankees will even consider putting him on the roster, and there are
lingering questions about the condition of Strawberry's knees and
whether he will able to play the outfield this season.
</P>
<P>
   But that issue will be addressed later. For now, Strawberry was
happy to be back in the Yankee family. He had remained in the Tampa
area since his arrest, hitting at a batting cage and, in his words,
``trying to keep a good attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not setting any personal timetables,'' he added. ``I'll
let the team judge where I'm at physically and mentally and
everything as far as getting back.'' &QL;

U.S. MOVES TO TIGHTEN REINS   ON NEW INTERNET REGULATOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (ATTN: Va.) 
 (DW) 
 By JERI CLAUSING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Responding to growing criticism of the way the
Internet's new governing body is operating, the Department of
Commerce on Friday told the nonprofit group to eliminate a
controversial $1 fee on Internet address registrations, to open its
board meetings to the public immediately and to draft clear
restrictions on the boundaries of its authority.
</P>
<P>
   Though created as a joint venture with the federal government,
the governing body, the Internet Corp. for Assigned Names and
Numbers, or Icann, has held its meetings behind closed doors since
it was formed last year. Criticism increased this spring when Icann
began making policy decisions, including one to levy fees on
Internet address registrations to finance its $5.7 million annual
budget.
</P>
<P>
   Commerce officials also fired a public warning shot at Network
Solutions, which has bristled at measures taken to end the
company's longtime monopoly in the lucrative business of
registering domain names, as Internet addresses are known.
</P>
<P>
   In its letter, Commerce officials insisted that the department
could and would revoke the company's right to register addresses if
it continued to refuse to recognize Icann's authority. One of
Icann's first charges from Commerce was to break up Network
Solutions' monopoly in the most popular domains _ those ending in
.com, .net and .org.
</P>
<P>
   Five companies have begun a test round of competition with
Network Solutions, but technical delays and disputes between the
company, Commerce and Icann have delayed the opening of full-scale
competition.
</P>
<P>
   Network Solutions called the recommended changes for Icann a
``good first step.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We clearly see this as the Department of Commerce resetting
Icann,'' said Christopher Clough, a company spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   As for the letter's warning to the company, he said, ``We don't
think it's an issue. We're working in negotiations with Commerce
towards an acceptable solution.''
</P>
<P>
   Esther Dyson, Icann's interim chairwoman, said the board would
give the letter serious consideration and might try to act on it
before the House Commerce Committee holds hearings on the matter
this month.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Ms. Dyson said she found the letter encouraging.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't say we were perfect,'' she said. ``But it said we
were worth improving.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposals and warnings were detailed in a 32-page document
the Commerce Department sent to Rep. Thomas Bliley III, the
chairman of the House Commerce Committee, who last month voiced
concern about the department's handing over to Icann oversight of
the Internet's administrative functions. Bliley, R-Va., Network
Solutions' home base, also asked Commerce and Ms. Dyson to respond
to concerns about the board's closed meetings, the $1 fee and other
controversial actions.
</P>
<P>
   That inquiry, along with similar letters from consumer
advocates, including Ralph Nader, followed a lobbying campaign by
Network Solutions, which insists that Icann is overstepping its
authority and trying to put the company out of business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Icann should immediately open its board meetings to the
public,'' the Commerce Department letter said. ``Transparency is
critical to establishing trust in decision making. And trust is
essential for Icann's ultimate success.''
</P>
<P>
   While defending Icann's authority to levy the $1 a year fee on
every domain name registered, the Commerce Department asked that it
be eliminated, at least temporarily, saying no permanent financing
method should be adopted until a permanent 18-member board is
elected.
</P>
<P>
   That puts Icann in a tough position, having spent the nearly
$500,000 in corporate donations for its start-up. But Commerce
pledged to help Icann secure government and private funds to keep
operating until a permanent revenue source is found.
</P>
<P>
   ``Icann's top priority must be completing the work necessary to
put in place an elected board of directors on a timely basis,'' the
Commerce letter said.
</P>
<P>
   Although the changes are posed as recommendations, not orders,
Commerce officials retain authority over Icann through next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Department has the authority to terminate its relationship
with Icann if we believe that Icann isn't acting in accordance with
the principles,'' of our agreement, said Andrew Pincus, general
counsel for the Commerce Department.
</P>
<P>
   Many critics greeted the Commerce letters as a welcome check on
the controversial board.
</P>
<P>
   ``Open board meetings are a no-brainer,'' said Jonathan
Zittrain, executive director of the Berkman Center for Internet and
Society. The letter also raised the stakes over Network Solutions'
refusal to recognize Icann. The company has balked at signing the
agreement that companies wishing to compete with it have had to
sign, saying the agreement gives Icann too much authority.
</P>
<P>
   To counter charges of over-regulation, Commerce asked Icann to
``assure all registrars and registries, through contract, that it
will restrict its policy development activities to matters that are
reasonably necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Network Solutions, the Commerce Department said that it
intends to take away the company's right to run the .com, .net and
.org registry if it fails to recognize the authority of whatever
body was appointed to administer the network.

   PASADENA, Calif. _ By kickoff time in today's final match for
the Women's World Cup, the Rose Bowl stands will resemble ringside
at a major prize fight because several celebrities are expected to
attend.
</P>
<P>
   Already sending positive RSVPs are actors Antonio Banderas,
Melanie Griffith, Elizabeth Shue and Scott Bakula, and singer k.d.
lang. Also in attendance will be President Clinton and the First
Family.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, between the third-place and championship games,
actress-turned-singer Jennifer Lopez will sing her hit ``If You Had
My Love,'' and ``Let's Get Loud.''
</P>
<P>
   The young girls in the audience will be treated to the group
Hanson singing the U.S. national anthem. Chinese celebrity Lin Liu
will sing that country's anthem.
</P>
<P>
   Consolation prize: In case you didn't know, the third-place game
between Norway and Brazil will precede the final today at the Rose
Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Norway, along with the United States, has been the best team in
women's soccer since the inception of the Women's World Cup. On the
other hand, Brazil has been a quick riser.
</P>
<P>
   ``We promise to make it an entertaining game for the fans,''
Brazilian Pretinha said. ``We like to play soccer and we hope they
will like to watch.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarl Toske, Norway's assistant coach, had his own perspective _
to paraphrase, this is a rebuilding year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are building a new team, with only six or seven players
left from our Olympic squad,'' he said. ``But we feel we proved
something.''
</P>
<P>
   Politically correct: U.S. coach Tony DiCicco, when asked if
President Clinton was visiting for purely political purposes,
demurred.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that's the intent of the President. I really
think he's a fan of this team,'' DiCicco said. ``And Chelsea has
always been a fan of this team. She sat on our bench once when we
beat Norway in Washington D.C., so I don't think there's any
political motivation here. He's just a fan, and whether there's any
outreach politically, I don't know. That's way over my head.''
</P>
<P>
   End is near: U.S. player Brandi Chastain will be sad when the
tournament is over.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I'm going to be very sad. It's hard to say goodbye to
something this wonderful and this motivating,'' she said. ``It's
hard to find motivation in things and this has been such a huge
motivation factor. It will be tough to go home and take a week off.
It will be hard to have that same motivation again knowing the
World Cup is four years away, but I think we'll use this event to
look back on.''
</P>
<P>
   Fear of the unknown: It has been pretty tough over the past few
days for the U.S. players to do any scouting of the Chinese team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Haven't seen any of their games,'' Tisha Venturini said after
a recent practice at Pomona College. ``Haven't seen any videotape
yet, either.''
</P>
<P>
   What makes it tougher is the lack of a certain sports channel at
the U.S. hotels.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hotels we have stayed in didn't have ESPN2 (which telecast
four of China's five tournament games) except in the bar, and we
didn't want to go down there because it would be impossible to
watch with the people wanting to talk with us,'' captain Carla
Overbeck said.
</P>
<P>
   Ceremony planned: Win or lose, the U.S. team will be honored in
a ceremony at the Los Angeles Convention Center on Sunday
afternoon, according to officials of the Los Angeles Sports and
Entertainment Commission.

JAMES FARMER, CIVIL RIGHTS LEADER, 79 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va., Miss., La. Texas, Mass.)   (EDS: An abridged version of this obit has moved as
OBIT-FARMER-ABRIDGED)  
(js) 
 By RICHARD SEVERO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   James Farmer, a principal founder of the Congress of Racial
Equality and the last survivor of the ``Big Four'' who shaped the
civil-rights struggle in the United States in the mid-1950s and
'60s, died Friday at Mary Washington Hospital in Fredericksburg,
Va., where he lived. He was 79. Farmer had been in failing health
for years, losing his sight and both his legs to severe diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   Farmer's main colleagues in the civil rights movement were the
Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. of the Southern Christian
Leadership Conference, who was assassinated in 1968; Whitney Young
of the Urban League, who died in 1971, and Roy Wilkins of the
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, who
died in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Although attention in recent years has focused on King's
activities, Farmer played a towering role in the movement as a
direct-action leader of the organization popularly known as CORE.
Claude Sitton, who covered the South for The New York Times during
the civil rights struggle, observed: ``CORE under Mr. Farmer often
served as the razor's edge of the movement. It was to CORE that the
four Greensboro, N.C., students turned after staging the first in
the series of sit-ins that swept the South in 1960. It was CORE
that forced the issue of desegregation in interstate transportation
with the Freedom Rides of 1961. It was CORE's James Chaney, Andrew
Goodman and Michael Schwerner _ a black and two whites _ who became
the first fatalities of the Mississippi Freedom Summer of 1964.''
</P>
<P>
   The three were murdered by a gang of Klansmen and buried beneath
an earthen dam near the town of Philadelphia. The CORE workers were
investigating a church burning and promoting black voter
registration.
</P>
<P>
   Farmer himself risked his life in several demonstrations. In
1963, Louisiana state troopers armed with guns, cattle prods and
tear gas hunted him door to door when he was trying to organize
protests in the town of Plaquemine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was meant to die that night,'' Farmer once said. ``They were
kicking open doors, beating up blacks in the streets, interrogating
them with electric cattle prods.'' A funeral home director had
Farmer ``play dead'' in the back of a hearse that carried him along
back roads and out of town.
</P>
<P>
   Farmer went to jail for ``disturbing the peace'' in Plaquemine,
and was behind bars on Aug. 28, 1963, the day that King delivered
his ``I Have a Dream'' speech as the climax of the March on
Washington. Farmer sent his own speech to the March on Washington,
and it was read by Floyd McKissick, an aide in CORE. ``We will not
stop,'' Farmer wrote, ``until the dogs stop biting us in the South
and the rats stop biting us in the North.''
</P>
<P>
   At one point, a friendly FBI agent told Farmer that an informant
had infiltrated the Ku Klux Klan in Louisiana, and had reported
that the Klan had voted to kill Farmer the next time he set foot in
Bogalusa. ``Tell me,'' Farmer said to the agent, ``were there any
dissenting votes?''
</P>
<P>
   Farmer was a disciple of Mohandas Gandhi, and it was Gandhi's
strategy of nonviolent direct action that was to become Farmer's
weapon against discrimination. A fierce integrationist, he enlisted
both whites and blacks as CORE volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   Some white liberals who generally approved of what Farmer was
doing frequently advised him to be more patient with a recalcitrant
society dominated by whites. They thought that the doctrine of
nonviolence was radical in its use of picketing and sit-ins. Some
thought it engendered bellicose responses from whites that did
nothing to further amicable race relations.
</P>
<P>
   On one tense occasion in the early 1960s, after a particularly
vicious spate of violence, Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy
suggested that Farmer's followers postpone some of their ``freedom
rides'' _ designed to desegregate the interstate bus system in the
South _ so that everyone could ``cool off.'' Farmer refused,
saying, ``We have been cooling off for 350 years.''
</P>
<P>
   As the turbulent decade of the 1960s unfolded, some blacks who
despaired that they would ever have an amicable relationship with
the white majority and regarded nonviolence as more of a weakness
than a strength, on occasion would ask Farmer, ``When are you going
to fight back?'' Farmer would always reply, ``We are fighting back,
we're only using new weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I lived in two worlds,'' Farmer said late in life, recalling
his role in the movement. ``One was the volatile and explosive one
of the new black Jacobins and the other was the sophisticated and
genteel one of the white and black liberal establishment. As a
bridge, I was called on by each side for help in contacting the
other.''
</P>
<P>
   Farmer, the son of a minister and the grandson of a slave, came
to feel that his generation of leaders had been all but forgotten
in recent years with the exception of King because of television's
use of film clips replaying his ``I Have a Dream Speech.''
</P>
<P>
   Farmer was appalled to learn that in one survey of blacks taken
in the 1990s, somebody said he thought that King's claim to fame
was that he had ``worked for Al Sharpton'' and that many young
blacks had never heard of Roy Wilkins, Whitney Young and Farmer or
had only the vaguest notion of what they had stood for. And so when
President Clinton awarded him a Presidential Medal of Freedom in
January 1998, Farmer said he felt ``vindication, an acknowledgment
at long last.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Farmer was proud of his role in founding CORE and guiding it to
becoming one of the most effective civil rights organizations of
the 1960s. The motivation for CORE came on a bright spring
afternoon in Chicago in 1942 when Farmer, then just a year out of
theology school, was walking with a white friend, George Houser.
The two decided to stop for coffee and doughnuts in Jack Spratt's
Coffee Shop on the South Side.
</P>
<P>
   The counterman made them wait even though there was almost
nobody in the restaurant, then tried to charge them a dollar apiece
for doughnuts that were going for a nickel. Finally he ordered them
out and threw their money on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt he had a problem about race,'' Farmer said later,
recalling the incident with typical understatement. Farmer, Houser
and a few others staged a successful sit-in demonstration at Jack
Spratt's. It was the first direct action of an organization they
formed, called at the time the Committee on Racial Equality.
</P>
<P>
   Within a year, CORE had a national membership, and within a few
years a roster of more than 60,000 members in more than 70
chapters, coast to coast. In its heyday in the 1960s, it claimed a
membership of 82,000 in 114 local groups.
</P>
<P>
   Farmer was equally proud of the work he did in 1961, when he
organized the Freedom Rides in the Deep South, a perilous effort in
which many black and white supporters were attacked and injured by
white segregationists.
</P>
<P>
   James Leonard Farmer was born on Jan. 20, 1920, in Marshall,
Texas. His father was James Leonard Farmer Sr., the son of a slave,
a minister-scholar who became a college professor and who delighted
in teaching literature in Greek, Hebrew and Aramaic. He was
believed to be the first black man from Texas ever to earn a
doctorate, which he did at Boston University. Farmer's mother was
the former Pearl Marion Houston, a teacher.
</P>
<P>
   As a boy, Farmer was shielded from the worst aspects of racism.
He used to say that as a ``faculty brat'' he spent most of his time
on the campuses of black colleges in the South where racial
incidents would not ordinarily happen. The houses he lived in were
filled with books and the conversation frequently was about the
ideas in those books, most of them about ancient cultures. They did
not ordinarily speak of the bleak, segregated world that existed
outside the campus.
</P>
<P>
   Farmer told Gay Talese of The New York Times in 1961 that his
first awareness of race came when he was 3 or 4 years old, living
in Holly Springs, Miss., where his father was on the faculty of
Rust College. One very hot day, young James went shopping with his
mother and asked her to buy him a soft drink. His mother told him
he would have to wait until they got home. He saw a white child go
into a store and get a drink, and it was not until he got home that
his mother explained to him why he could not do the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until then, I had not realized that I was colored,'' Farmer
said. ``I had lived a sheltered life on campus. My mother fell
across the bed and cried.'' Farmer said it did not make him bitter,
but, over the years, he became ``determined to do something about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   His determination was strengthened between 1934 and 1938, when
he was an undergraduate at Wiley College in Marshall, Texas. He
would go to movies in Marshall, and was made to sit in the
``buzzard's roost,'' the balcony set aside for black people. During
the same period, he got a job as a caddy, but found himself
segregated even in the caddy yard.
</P>
<P>
   Years later, when he looked back at his youth in the South, he
sometimes remembered the times when black children and white
children played peacefully together. The real separation between
the races came at puberty, he recalled, when white parents
reinforced in their children that they were white and that blacks
were something else. He recalled that when he was in his teens, the
friends he had known as a little boy ``would only look away'' when
they saw him in the street.
</P>
<P>
   Farmer considered both medicine and the ministry as vocations
during his undergraduate days. He discovered that he could not
stand the sight of blood, and, in 1938, after he completed his
baccalaureate work at Wiley, he enrolled in Howard University's
School of Religion. It was at Howard that he was introduced to the
philosophy of Gandhi.
</P>
<P>
   With his commanding frame, booming bass-baritone voice and
decisive way of speaking, everyone thought he would be a fine
preacher. But to the dismay of his father, Farmer decided against
becoming a Methodist minister because, in those days, the Methodist
church in the South was segregated. ``I didn't see how I could
honestly preach the Gospel of Christ in a church that practiced
discrimination,'' he said. He was quick to assure his father that
his turning away from Methodism did not represent any lessening of
his belief in Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   After World War II started, Farmer, a conscientious objector,
served as race relations secretary for the Fellowship of
Reconciliation, a pacifist organization. He subsequently worked as
an organizer in the South for the Upholsterer's International Union
and later for the State, County and Municipal Employees Union.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1940s, before giving CORE his full attention, he was
also a program director for the NAACP and wrote radio and
television scripts as well as magazine articles on race relations
for Crisis, Fellowship, World Frontier and the Hadassah News.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1950s he worked assiduously to bring an end to
segregation in Southern schools. He planned and organized CORE
projects, including a Pilgrimage of Prayer in 1959 to protest the
closing of public schools in Richmond, Va., to avoid complying with
the 1954 Supreme Court decision outlawing segregation in the public
schools.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the 1960s, CORE's black volunteers, under Farmer's
personal direction, stood peacefully in lines all over the South,
insisting on the right to enter theaters, coffee shops, swimming
pools, bowling alleys and other segregated public places from which
they had always been barred.
</P>
<P>
   Farmer did not become the $11,500-a-year salaried national
director of CORE until February 1961, just before he initiated his
first Freedom Ride. His father, by then retired and living in
Washington, died just as Farmer was getting that effort started.
</P>
<P>
   CORE and another civil rights group, the Fellowship of
Reconciliation, held a Freedom Ride in 1947. A year earlier, the
U.S. Supreme Court had ruled that segregated seating of interstate
bus passengers was unconstitutional, but the ruling was virtually
ignored in the South. An integrated group was sent to call
attention to that injustice. Some members were arrested and served
on a chain gang in North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   In 1961, CORE decided to try again. Its bus riders were
assaulted when using restrooms and lunchrooms in terminals in
Virginia and the Carolinas.
</P>
<P>
   In Alabama, their bus was firebombed in the town of Anniston and
the riders stoned. In Birmingham, a mob attacked the riders and one
of them, William Barbee, was paralyzed for life. They were savagely
beaten again in Montgomery.

 &HT;    Surprise start by Chen gets Sox swinging
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Bruce Chen had only a couple hours to contemplate his
seventh major league start Friday night after he was asked to
replace an ailing Odalis Perez against the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   This was one Chen would like to forget.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox hammered Chen for three home runs and hung on for a
5-4 win in front of 49,636 at Turner Field, the largest Atlanta
crowd since Mark McGwire came to town last Aug. 1 during his home
run chase.
</P>
<P>
   Chen picked up the loss in his third start for Atlanta this
season, and his first since returning to the Braves from Richmond
on Monday when John Smoltz went on the disabled list again with an
inflamed elbow.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox, playing without star shortstop Nomar Garciaparra
for the seventh consecutive game and limping in on a three-game
losing streak, evened this interleague season series at 2-2 with
two more games to play here over the weekend. If Chen wasn't
striking a batter out or walking him, he was leaving his pitches
up, and the Red Sox hitters knew exactly what to do with those. So
Chen's line looked like this: four hits allowed, three of them home
runs, five strikeouts and four walks.
</P>
<P>
   Spoiling a 3-0 Braves head start on Boston starter Bret
Saberhagen, Chen's night unraveled on a leadoff homer by Wilton
Veras in the third inning and back-to-back homers by Damon Buford
and Mike Stanley to start the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   The only reason he didn't give up the lead at that point was
Andruw Jones' diving catch in shallow center field to take a
run-scoring hit away from Saberhagen. Chen lasted only one more
batter, walking Chad Fonville on four pitches to lead off the
fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Fonville came around to score when Andruw Jones came up a few
feet short of another great catch, allowing Darren Lewis a triple
that gave the Red Sox their first lead, 4-3.
</P>
<P>
   Jones' center field clinic continued in the fifth inning when he
caught a Troy O'Leary drive over his shoulder while crashing into
the wall.
</P>
<P>
   Walt Weiss broke an 0-for-25 slump with a soft liner to right to
drive in Eddie Perez, who had doubled, to cut the lead to 5-4 in
the seventh. But Brian Jordan grounded out to strand runners at
first and second.

 UNDATED: in Montgomery.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Everyone expected more violence when a small band of young
blacks and whites from CORE and the Student Nonviolent Coordinating
Committee boarded buses for the last leg of the Freedom Ride, from
Montgomery to Jackson, Miss. King, on probation for his arrest
during sit-ins in Atlanta, decided not to go and was criticized for
his decision. When a follower asked Farmer if he was going, Farmer
climbed aboard the bus, though he was quaking with fear. But the
journey was completed without further violence because of a deal
worked out between the attorney general, Robert F. Kennedy, and
James O. Eastland, the segregationist senator from Mississippi. But
Farmer was arrested in Jackson for disturbing the peace and spent
40 days in Mississippi jails.
</P>
<P>
   If the Freedom Rides stiffened opposition to desegregation in
some quarters in the South, the courage of Farmer's CORE volunteers
captured the imagination of blacks throughout the country, who
decided to join the civil rights struggle. It also aroused the
conscience of many whites both in America and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end, it was a success,'' Farmer said of the Freedom
Rides, ``because Bobby Kennedy had the Interstate Commerce
Commission issue an order, with teeth in it, that he could enforce,
banning segregation in interstate travel. That was my proudest
achievement.''
</P>
<P>
   Subsequently, Farmer turned his attention to the lack of
employment opportunities for blacks. He sought no quotas because he
said he was convinced that if blacks were given a fair chance they
would do just fine, but he made it clear that he wanted to see some
black faces at construction sites, especially those financed with
public money. He ordered sit-ins in the early 1960s at the New York
offices of Mayor Robert F. Wagner and Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller.
He also organized picketing at White Castle hamburger stands in New
York City, accusing the chain of refusing to hire black workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not pressing toward the brink of violence, but for the
peak of freedom,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Farmer kept CORE focused on integration. When, in 1965, CORE
officials called for a pullout of U.S. troops from Vietnam, Farmer
insisted that the organization reverse itself. He did not approve
of the war, but thought that CORE should not express itself on U.S.
foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   He resigned his CORE director's job the same year to head what
he hoped would be an intensive literacy project financed by the
administration of Lyndon B. Johnson. The project failed to
materialize, and there was an open break between Farmer and R.
Sargent Shriver, the director of the federal antipoverty agency,
the Office of Economic Opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Farmer did several things in the late 1960s. He taught at
Lincoln University, a black institution in Oxford, Pa., about 45
miles southwest of Philadelphia, advised the State of New Jersey on
problems of illiteracy, and, in 1968, ran for Congress. A Liberal
candidate, backed by Republicans, in Brooklyn's 12th Congressional
District, he lost to the Democrat, Shirley Chisholm. Also in 1968,
he supported the re-election of Sen. Jacob Javits, a liberal
Republican, who was jeered at a campaign rally in a black
neighborhood of New York City. ``Jake Javits may be white on the
outside but he's black on the inside,'' Farmer said, calming the
crowd. That same year he backed Vice President Hubert Humphrey in
his run for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   It had always been Farmer's position that blacks, no matter how
they felt, should be a part of government, and so he readily
accepted an invitation from President Richard Nixon in 1969 to
become an assistant secretary in the Department of Health,
Education and Welfare. Farmer was immediately attacked by some
militant civil rights advocates, who wanted nothing to do with
Nixon. But Roger Wilkins and Whitney Young refrained from
criticizing Farmer because they agreed with him that blacks needed
such involvement if they were ever to have anything to say about
shaping national policy on race.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Farmer defended Nixon's racial policies, but in 1970
he quit his post, complaining that the Washington bureaucracy moved
too slowly and saying that he felt he was more effective outside
it. Somewhat later, he complained that Nixon had virtually no
contact with blacks and instead relied on Leonard Garment, a white
aide, to explain black problems to him.
</P>
<P>
   In 1975, Farmer broke with CORE over what he regarded as CORE's
excessively pro-leftist position that sided with the Marxist
faction in the civil war in Angola. The next year he resigned from
the group he had founded. In 1978, he lent his name to a lawsuit
that attempted to unseat CORE's director, Roy Innis.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1980s, Farmer worked hard on his memoir, ``Lay Bare
the Heart,'' which was published in 1985. Claude Sitton, reviewing
the book approvingly for The New York Times, said that Farmer,
``more than any other civil rights leader'' had fought against
racism and had ``attempted to hold the movement true to its
purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   Among Farmer's other writings was ``Freedom _ When?'' a book
published in 1966. Before his health failed he taught for several
years at Mary Washington College in Fredericksburg.
</P>
<P>
   Farmer's brief first marriage ended in divorce. He married Lula
A. Peterson, whom he met in 1949 when she was a graduate student in
economics at Northwestern University and a white member of the CORE
chapter in Evanston, Ill. She died in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   They had two daughters, Tami and Abbey.
</P>
<P>
   In his last years, Farmer lived alone in a remote house near
Fredericksburg, confined to a wheelchair and often in need of an
oxygen tent. When visitors came, he would joke about the times he
had come close to death. Asked by a friend if he had ever seen a
tunnel. Farmer acknowledged that he had, but instead of seeing St.
Peter at the end of it he had seen the Devil, who said not to let
Farmer in because `` `He'll organize a resistance movement and try
to put out my fire.' '' &QL;

JOE TORRE'S   REAL NEWS   ABOUT 2001  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK_ When Joe Torre casually mentioned in a television
interview that he was ``not thinking about'' managing the Yankees
beyond the 2001 season, it didn't deserve the headlines it
received. The Yankee manager was merely repeating what he had first
mentioned as long ago as last October when he signed his two-year
contract extension.
</P>
<P>
   But what did deserve headlines was that Joe Torre is the first
Yankee manager in nearly three decades of George Steinbrenner's
often tyrannical regime to assume that he would still be in the
Yankee dugout after the next 2 1/2 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Now that is man-bites-dog news, if not manager-bites-owner news.
Any of Torre's 13 predecessors in the Steinbrenner regime surely
would have agreed, especially Billy Martin, who, during any of his
five tempestuous terms, never dared to assume that he would still
be in the Yankee dugout after the next 2 1/2 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Or until the next time the red phone rang.
</P>
<P>
   In the tumult of those Martin years, a red telephone sat on his
desk in the manager's office at Yankee Stadium. Whenever it rang,
he would all but jump out of his chair.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's George,'' he would say, waving a hand at anyone who was
there. ``You better leave.''
</P>
<P>
   As his visitors walked out of the office and closed the door,
they always wondered if Billy Martin was about to leave, too.
Eventually, during the 1988 season, he left for the fifth and last
time.
</P>
<P>
   Now there's a black phone on the desk in the manager's office at
Yankee Stadium. When it rings, Joe Torre is always quick to answer
it because it might be George and he knows who's the Boss. But even
when it is the principal owner, Torre doesn't appear to be alarmed.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Yankees lost, 5-2, in the first game of the Shea
Stadium segment of their six-game subway series with the Mets
Friday night, they were halfway through their fourth season without
a seriously inflammable flap between the manager and the principal
owner.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Martin and some other Yankee managers, Torre has
maintained his cool even when he knows George is annoyed with him.
He has been known to phone George first and say, ``How's your
personality today, Boss?'' and then talk out the disagreement.
</P>
<P>
   There is a mutual respect between the principal owner and Torre
that seldom existed with other Yankee managers. When Torre first
took over in 1996, he told his coaches, ``If you take his money,
you've got to take'' his, shall we say, shenanigans.
</P>
<P>
   Torre is so cool, he has even cooled the principal owner a few
degrees, at least publicly.
</P>
<P>
   You haven't heard the principal owner second-guessing Torre's
strategy or psychology. Not that there has been any real reason to
grumble. Now in his fourth season, Torre has guided the Yankees to
two World Series championships, two American League East titles and
their current first-place perch.
</P>
<P>
   But when the Yankees were winning two World Series and four AL
pennants under Martin and Bob Lemon two decades ago, success never
stopped the impatient principal owner from growling.
</P>
<P>
   When the Yankees were losing, nobody was safe, not even Yogi
Berra. Early in the 1985 season, Yogi understandably assumed he
would be the manager for more than 16 games. He was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Until Torre arrived, life with George was like that for all the
Yankee managers, beginning with Ralph Houk, who resigned after a
fourth-place finish in 1973 rather than listen to him anymore. The
others would come and go _ Bill Virdon, Martin, Lemon, Martin
again, Dick Howser, Gene Michael, Lemon again, Michael again, Clyde
King, Martin again, Berra, Martin again, Lou Piniella, Martin
again, Piniella again, Dallas Green, Bucky Dent, Stump Merrill,
Buck Showalter.
</P>
<P>
   Over four seasons, which included the strike-shortened 1994
schedule, Showalter was the Yankee manager for 581 consecutive
games, a record for the Steinbrenner era, when managers changed
more often than batboys.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't count the 36 games Torre missed at the start of
this season while recuperating from prostate surgery, he is now
approaching Showalter's mark. But he has established one record for
a Yankee manager in the Steinbrenner regime: assuming he will still
be the manager after another 2 1/2 seasons. &QL;

 By BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a lengthy investigation of the New York City
Police Department, federal prosecutors have amassed evidence of
systemwide problems in the department's handling of police
brutality complaints, and are pressing the Giuliani administration
to undertake reforms, officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   If the city does not agree to changes sought by the U.S.
attorney in Brooklyn, Zachary Carter, the Justice Department could
sue the city, seeking a court-ordered overhaul and possible
oversight by a federal monitor.
</P>
<P>
   Carter, who opened his investigation after the August 1997
torture of Abner Louima by two officers in a Brooklyn station
house, is now in secret talks with top Giuliani administration
officials over a possible settlement, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   One hurdle is that Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, a staunch defender of
the Police Department, has said he would be unwilling to accept the
imposition of a federal monitor or other outside oversight of the
department, which is by far the largest in the country with 39,000
officers.
</P>
<P>
   Carter's precise findings were not known Friday, but the Justice
Department has said that he has examined whether incidents of
excessive force by officers ``were the product of systemic
deficiencies in police operations, including possible failures in
intake and investigation, discipline and supervision.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics have charged that police officials do not aggressively
pursue allegations of brutality by officers, even in cases in which
outside investigators have found evidence to support the charges.
For example, Carter's office has looked at how the department
follows up cases referred by the Civilian Complaint Review Board,
which investigates allegations of police wrongdoing, and cases in
which the city has settled lawsuits charging officers with
brutality.
</P>
<P>
   Carter's investigation is one of at least 10 nationwide of
police and sheriff's departments by prosecutors looking for
patterns of brutality and other civil rights violations. The
actions reflect the Justice Department's use of a 1994 law that
grew out of the Rodney King beating in Los Angeles, which
authorizes federal prosecutors to seek changes in the operations of
local departments.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division and
the U.S. attorney in Los Angeles announced the most recent such
inquiry, investigating the use of force and treatment of minorities
by officers in Riverside, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department has also acknowledged that it is
investigating racial profiling by New Jersey State Police troopers,
in which officers stop drivers on suspicion of criminal actions
based solely on race. And after the fatal shooting of Amadou Diallo
by officers in the Bronx, Justice officials said Mary Jo White, the
U.S. attorney in Manhattan, was examining whether certain patterns
or practices of the city's Street Crime Unit violated civil rights
laws. Both of those investigations are continuing.
</P>
<P>
   City and police officials refused to answer questions Friday
night on any talks with Carter's office. Previously, Police
Commissioner Howard Safir and the corporation counsel, Michael D.
Hess, had said they were cooperating with Carter's investigation,
which Carter has confirmed publicly. City officials have said they
provided thousands of files concerning police brutality complaints
and how the department responded to them; the training of officers;
their use of firearms, and lawsuits against the department.
</P>
<P>
   In response to questions Friday night, Carter said that under
federal rules involving such investigations, the Justice Department
must bring its findings to a city or municipal government for
possible resolution before filing a lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``At this particular juncture, it would not be
constructive for me to comment on any questions about any
discussions with the city.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Carter's investigation could become a divisive political issue
in New York. If he decides to sue the city, the law requires that
he have the approval of Attorney General Janet Reno. This could
result in the Clinton Justice Department's attacking the Giuliani
administration in federal court at the same time that Hillary
Rodham Clinton is running against Giuliani for a U.S. Senate seat.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear how such a court battle would play out in a
campaign, but Giuliani, who has trumpeted the sharp reduction in
crime in the city as his greatest achievement, has vigorously
defended the Police Department's performance.
</P>
<P>
   As the mayor said last March: ``This Police Department, for all
its faults and imperfections, and I am acutely aware of them, is
the best in the country. In every respect. Not just in reducing
crime, but in dealing with crowd control, in dealing with
minorities, in dealing with sensitive issues.''
</P>
<P>
   He has said that he has no tolerance for officers who violate
people's rights, but he has also condemned critics who blame the
entire department for the transgressions of a few officers.
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``Before you can start talking about federal
micromanaging of this Police Department, there are about 200 police
departments you'd have to put ahead of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The results of Carter's investigation have been anxiously
awaited by people inside and outside the Police Department, critics
and supporters alike. For critics, including many black and
Hispanic New Yorkers, it is viewed as perhaps the best opportunity
yet to eradicate frequent police mistreatment of minorities and a
culture of officers who cover for the misdeeds of colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   But city officials have said they are confident that Carter
would uncover isolated problems only, certainly no pattern or
policy of officials' condoning brutality or violations of civil
rights.
</P>
<P>
   Carter is completing his investigation while he prepares to
leave office next Friday to join a private law firm.
</P>
<P>
   Although officials would not discuss Carter's findings, he
seemed likely to focus on improving the way the department follows
up on complaints of brutality committed by officers, particularly
those investigated by the Civilian Complaint Review Board.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the review board has criticized the department's
lack of response when it has substantiated allegations of brutality
and referred them to the department for further disciplinary
action.

GASTINEAU GETS 15 DAYS AFTER HARASSMENT CHARGE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mark Gastineau, the former Jets defensive end who had
a reputation for being volatile both on and off the field, was
sentenced to 15 days in jail Friday after being arrested on charges
of violating an order of protection obtained by his wife.
</P>
<P>
   Gastineau, 42, was arrested Monday after he turned himself in at
a Queens precinct station house on charges of violating a court
order to stop harassing his estranged wife, Patricia Schorr.
</P>
<P>
   He is accused of going to his wife's apartment in the Forest
Hills neighborhood of Queens, on June 22, leaning on the intercom
buzzer from 3:30 a.m. until 6:30 a.m. and refusing to leave,
according to the Queens district attorney's office. He turned
himself in on Monday and was arrested. Ms. Schorr had obtained the
order of protection after Gastineau pleaded guilty last October to
a misdemeanor assault charge for hitting her and threatening her
with a glass cocktail table.
</P>
<P>
   But even as charges for harassment in the intercom incident are
pending, Justice Deborah Stevens Modica of the State Supreme Court
in Queens, sent Gastineau to jail Friday because his Monday arrest
violated the terms of a conditional discharge in a separate
harassment case involving another woman whom he dated before
marrying Ms. Schorr last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``In view of the defendant's past transgressions, as well as the
case here, we felt it was appropriate that he serve some jail
time,'' said Richard A. Brown, the Queens district attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Gastineau, who lives in the Bayside area of Queens, pleaded
guilty last year to harassing the unidentified woman on a street in
Bayside in February 1998. He was charged with hitting the
33-year-old woman and bruising her face and wrist. He was released
on the condition that he attend an anger management class and that
he stay out of trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Modica ruled Friday that his arrest in the case involving his
wife constituted a violation of those conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Gastineau played for the Jets for 10 years and accumulated a
record of 22 sacks in the 1984 season.

U.S. BRACES FOR CHINA IN CUP FINAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Mia Hamm said she would get to bed early
Friday. Tiffeny Milbrett, suffering from recent nightmares, hoped
she could get some rest. The coolest of them all, goalkeeper Briana
Scurry, said she would sleep like a baby.
</P>
<P>
   Those were the thoughts of the players at the end of 18 months
of build-up, all the hoopla that has surrounded the United States
women's national soccer team.
</P>
<P>
   All that is left now is China _ the only team that can spoil all
this fun.
</P>
<P>
   In front of President Clinton and more than 90,000 at the Rose
Bowl this afternoon, the Americans hope to repeat their 1996
Olympic gold medal-winning performance against the Chinese when the
two teams meet for the FIFA Women's World Cup championship at 12:50
p.m.
</P>
<P>
   In the third-place match, Brazil faces Norway at 10:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel good about where we are as a team right now,'' said
Hamm, the world's all-time leading scorer. ``But we need to make
sure everything comes together all at once. We have to leave
everything on the field because there's nothing to play for after
(today).
</P>
<P>
   ``I still think our best soccer is ahead of us. As individuals,
we've seen some incredible performances, but collectively we know
we have to be at the top of our game to win this championship.
Anything less and it's not going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States has been successful against China many times
in the past, holding an 11-5-5 edge in the series. But recent
history suggests that China could steal the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   China has been more dominant in this tournament, routing Norway,
the defending Women's World Cup champion, 5-0 in the semifinals.
And the Chinese have beaten the U.S. twice in the past year.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, meanwhile, struggled to a 3-2 victory over
Germany in the quarterfinals, and though the Americans beat Brazil
2-0 to reach the championship, they hold only a 24-21 advantage in
shots against their last two opponents. China has a 44-22 margin in
shots against its last two foes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, based on their recent games with us and the fact
they played so well against Norway, everyone has to look at them
and expect them to run away with this championship,'' said U.S.
coach Tony DiCicco. ``We have to be the underdog. They breezed
through group play, dissected the world champion and beat us two
out of three.''
</P>
<P>
   Another concern for DiCicco is the team's concentration. While
China has had little disruptions, the U.S. has captured the hearts
of America, resulting in an onslaught of media and fan support
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we kind of got caught up in the hoopla before the
quarterfinal (against Germany),'' said DiCicco. ``We talked about
how we should be turning into a laser with our concentration, not a
laser show.
</P>
<P>
   ``It started to get like that, but I don't think it's a problem
anymore. This team has always said it's on a mission to win the
gold medal and world championship, and they're not going to let
distractions get in the way of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, they will have enough problems dealing with China's Sun
Wen, the leading scorer of the tournament with seven goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to give her the same amount of respect we gave to
Sissi (of Brazil),'' said defender Brandi Chastain. ``They both
have the potential to score any time they touch the ball. We have
to be extra conscious when she gets into the attacking third
because she's sneaky and tricky.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. defender Kate Sobrero will have the dangerous task of
marking Sun.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't scare me,'' said Sobrero. ``That's what I like.
That's what I'm best at, defending somebody. It's not the
play-making ability out of the back. I just boot it and get it away
from me. If anything, I'm excited to have this challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   More than just Sun, the key for the American team is patience.
China will likely dominate most of the possessions with quick
one-touch passes. The U.S. needs to close China's space and take
advantage of every opportunity offensively.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the front to the back, all their players have good
quickness and speed,'' said Chastain. ``But then again, that
defines our game as well. They're proficient at the little
combination plays, but how quick they pull those off and how well
they run off the ball has a lot to do with how well we defend.''
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the day, however, it should all come down to how
well the U.S. plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``China's probably playing the best that we've seen them play in
a long time,'' said Hamm. ``But what's nice about this game is that
anything can happen. We need to go out and expect to get China's
best game, but if we go out and play our best game we're going to
be OK at the end.''

MARK O'BRIEN, PARALYZED JOURNALIST , DIES AT 49  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Mass.)   By WILLIAM H. HONAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mark O'Brien, the subject of an Academy Award-winning
documentary about his journalism career, conducted mostly from an
iron lung, died on Sunday at his home in Berkeley, Calif. He was
49.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was complications from bronchitis, said O'Brien's
brother, Kenneth.
</P>
<P>
   The 1997 film ``Breathing Lessons: The Life and Work of Mark
O'Brien,'' directed by Jessica Yu, described his struggle to live
productively with minimal assistance and his determination to live
on his own and work. He also founded a publishing company.
</P>
<P>
   Months of declining health had kept O'Brien dependent on the
iron lung for all but a few hours a week, his friends said.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien, who was born in Boston and reared in Sacramento,
Calif., was 6 years old when polio left him paralyzed from the neck
down and forced to begin using the iron lung.
</P>
<P>
   At some times in his youth, and for a brief period as recently
as last year, O'Brien's breathing could be supported by an
inflatable vest called a turtle shell. But for most of his life he
depended on the much more cumbersome iron lung, which encased most
of his body and helped him breathe by changing the pressure around
him.
</P>
<P>
   About 100 polio survivors in the United States are using iron
lungs.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien enrolled at the University of California at Berkeley in
1978. He became a familiar figure on the streets of Berkeley,
navigating his electric gurney on trips between the campus and the
tiny apartment where he kept his iron lung. In 1982, he received a
bachelor's degree in English literature.
</P>
<P>
   After repeated applications, O'Brien was admitted to the
Graduate School of Journalism at Berkeley, and his acceptance set a
precedent that helped other severely disabled applicants to state
universities.
</P>
<P>
   His work was first published in 1979, when Co-Evolution
Quarterly printed his essay on independent living. Sandy Close,
executive editor of Pacific News Service, saw the article and hired
O'Brien as a correspondent. Close later produced ``Breathing
Lessons.''
</P>
<P>
   Close said O'Brien initially dictated his articles, then used a
stick in his mouth to press the keys of an IBM Selectric typewriter
and finally employed a word processor.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, O'Brien co-founded Lemonade Factory, a small press in
Berkeley that publishes poetry by people with disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien, who said his strong Roman Catholic faith helped him
cope with his disability, had two great passions besides writing:
baseball and Shakespeare.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his brother, Kenneth, of Granite Bay, Calif., he
is survived by his father, Walter F., also of Granite Bay, and a
sister, Rachel Jordan, of Weimar, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien published several volumes of poetry, including a
collection called ``Breathing,'' which included the following
lines:
</P>
<P>
   This most excellent canopy, the air, look you,
</P>
<P>
   Presses down upon me
</P>
<P>
   At fifteen pounds per square inch,
</P>
<P>
   A dense, heavy, blue glowing ocean,
</P>
<P>
   Supporting the weight of condors
</P>
<P>
   That swim its churning currents.
</P>
<P>
   All I get is a thin stream of it,
</P>
<P>
   A finger's width of the rope that ties me to life
</P>
<P>
   As I labor like a stevedore to keep the connection. &QL;
