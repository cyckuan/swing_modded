<HEADLINE> Final Stage For S. Africa's Draft Constitution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 1 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's
constitution-writing process entered a final stage today with the
start of a three-day private talk attended by delegates from
almost all the parties in the Constitutional Assembly (CA).
</P>
<P>
An agreement is expected to be reached by the CA's
Constitutional Committee on Thursday following the talks aimed at
resolving the remaining problems such as provincial powers, death
penalty, righ to strike, etc..
</P>
<P>
Other problems include the appointment of judges, state
funding for schools based on language and culture, proposed
multi-party participation in the executive, the principle of
self-determination, local government, and traditional
authorities.
</P>
<P>
After finding solutions on these issues, the legal experts
will prepare a draft constitution for tabling and debating in the
Constitutional Committee from April 15 to 19, after which the CA
will debate it until May 6.
</P>
<P>
Plenary sessions of the 490-member CA had been scheduled from
April 22 to May 8 for the adoption process to meet the May 9
deadline set by the interim constitution for passing South
Africa's final constitution.
</P>
<P>
CA Chairman Cyril Ramaphosa had repeatedly stated that he was
confident a final constitution would be adopted by the deadline
with full consensus among the parties.
</P>
<P>
But if the new constitution was not passed by a two-third
majority by May 9, the CA's seven-member panel of experts would
be asked in the next month to solve the problems.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Foreign Minister Emre
Gonensay said here today that Turkey was still expecting a
positive response from Greece to its recently announced peace
proposal for talks with Athens.
</P>
<P>
"We retain our hope that a new era can be opened in the
bilateral relations between Turkey and Greece," Gonensay told the
parliament when presenting his ministry's budget proposal to the
Parliamentary Planning and Budget Commission.
</P>
<P>
On March 24, Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz called for
unconditional talks with Greece to sort out problems relating to
the disputed Aegean islets, saying that Turkey was prepared to
sign a "friendship and neighborliness agreement" with Athens and
to initiate military confidence-building measures in the Aegean
region.
</P>
<P>
Turkish sources said that Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis
was expected to respond officially to Yilmaz's initiative.
</P>
<P>
Tension between Turkey and Greece peaked in late January when
they came to the brink of war over possession of the disputed
Imia islets on the Aegean Sea. The United States interfered and
prevented a possible conflict between the two feuding NATO
members.

<HEADLINE> Droughts In Southern Africa To Stay, Says Expert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Southern Africa is expected to
experience severe droughts in every 10 years, a weather expert
has said.
</P>
<P>
The expert, Leonard Ungani at the SADC Drought Monitoring
Centre, said in a paper today that statistics showed
that there had been a 10 percent drop in rainfall figures during
the past 95 years.
</P>
<P>
He said evidence showed there would be two severe droughts in
every 10 years and that four seasons in every 10 would experience
rainfall that was ''well below normal''.
</P>
<P>
''There is a high probability that any given season will have
below normal rainfall,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
To show the worrying weather patterns, he said in the urban
centres, nighttime temperatures had risen by 1.2 percent in the
June-August period, and daytime temperatures by 0.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
This was the result of modern infrastructure such as tarred
roads and the depletion of the ozone layer.
</P>
<P>
''Prospects of the southern African region ever ridding itself
of droughts are bleak, droughts are here to stay,'' he said.

ANKARA, April 2 (Xinhua) -- An earthquake measuring 4.9 on the

<HEADLINE> GCC Chief Stresses Importance of Private Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, April 2 (Xinhua) -- The Secretary-General of the
Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), Jamil al-Hojeilan, underlined
today the importance the member states were giving to the private
sector in the Gulf region.
</P>
<P>
According to Kuwait News Agency, in an inaugural address to
the 11th meeting between the GCC General Secretariat and Chairmen
of the Boards of the GCC Chambers of Commerce held in Riyadh,
Saudi Arabia, al-Hojeilan said the activation of the role of the
private sector required coordination between the GCC General
Secretariat and the Union of GCC Chambers of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is attended by First-Deputy Chairman of the Kuwaiti
Chamber of Commerce Abdel Razak Al-Zayed, board member Abdel Wahab
Al-Wazan and Director-General Ahmad al-Haroun.
</P>
<P>
On the economic integrity project among the GCC states,
al-Hojeilan, a Saudi Arabian career diplomat, said what was
achieved in this field over the past 15 years did not meet the
aspiration of GCC leaders and citizens.
</P>
<P>
The new GCC secretary-general, who assumed office Monday, said
some obstacles which he did not name prevented substantial
progress in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Al-Hojeilan noted that the private sector was able to support
the economy and absorb modern developments.
</P>
<P>
He said the GCC constitutes an entity of joint action capable
of adopting unified decisions related to essential issues and
putting the basis of integrity among the member states.
</P>
<P>
The Chairman of the Union of GCC Chambers of Commerce, Hassan
Zein el-Abidine, expressed hope that al-Hojeilan would succeed in
overcoming obstacles facing the implementation of all the articles
of the GCC joint economic agreement and asserted the union's
keenness to support this march.
</P>
<P>
Zein el-Abidine said the current stage required an
intensification of efforts to cope with regional and
international developments.
</P>
<P>
Secretary General of the Union of GCC Chambers of Commerce
Mohammad al-Mulla said the current situation required the
formulation of a joint perspective to face rapid economic changes
and developments, such as the rise of economic blocs in the
post-peace era.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is expected to discuss the economic
recommendations of Muscat summit of GCC leaders, in additions to
memos on ways to promote economic and trade relations between the
member states.

LAGOS, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian Minister of Information
and Culture Walter Ofonagoro has called on Nigerians to assist
the government in its effort to protect cultural properties from
extinction, the News Agency of Nigeria reported today.
</P>
<P>
The minister made the call at the closing of an exhibition,
"The Niger Valleys" on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The River Niger has been playing an important role in the
socio-economic life of the countries through which it flows. It
has provided a major link for commercial activities and a
transport route to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
An exhibition, which featured relics from Nigeria, Mali,
Burkina faso, Mauritania, Niger and Guinea, had been mounted in
Paris, Leyde, Philadelphia, Bamako, Ouagadogou, Naimey,
Nouakchott, Conakry and Lagos.
</P>
<P>
In a speech, the Director-General of the Nigeria's National
Commission for Museums and Monument, Yaro Gella, appealed to
Nigerians to stop the sale of ancient art works in their
possession for hard currency, explaining that such an action
amounted to "selling away your history". He urged Nigerians to
deposit ancient art works in their possession with the commission
for protection.

HARARE, April 2 (Xinhua) -- The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ)
said today in its latest statistical report that the country's
agricultural output, which declined by 12 percent in 1995, is
forecast to rise by 18 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The bank said that the key agricultural sector has recovered
from last year's disastrous drought, with indications that over
200,000 tonnes of maize will be exported while tobacco sales will
reach 444 million US Dollars.
</P>
<P>
''World maize stocks are currently at low levels as a result
of the poor USA 1995 crop, a factor which should contribute to
firm maize export prices in 1996,'' the bank said.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe's cotton production is expected to more than double
to 220,000 tonnes this year compared with 100,600 tonnes last
year, the bank said. enditem

<HEADLINE> WHO Announces Breakthrough in New Male Contraceptive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, April 2 (Xinhua) -- A two-year clinical trial of the
World Health Organization (WHO) has achieved a major breakthrough
in the development of a new contraceptive for men with an overall
effectiveness rate of 98.6 percent, the WHO announced here today.
</P>
<P>
"The findings in the WHO study have brought us a step closer to
developing a hormonal contraceptive for men," said Dr Giuseppe
Benagiano, Director of the WHO special program which carried out
the study.
</P>
<P>
The results of this trial are especially important because the
development of new, safe, effective, reversible and acceptable
contraceptive methods for men will expand the options available to
couples who wish to plan their families, WHO experts said.
</P>
<P>
At present, the only contraceptive options available to men are
the condom, withdrawal and vasectomy. The new method is far
superior to the currently available ones and its effectiveness is
comparable to that of hormonal methods for women such as the oral
contraceptive pill, according to the WHO.
</P>
<P>
A total of 401 couples took part in the WHO clinical trial
which was carried out in nine countries of four continents. The
treatment consisted of weekly injections of 200 mg of testosterone
enanthate, a synthetic derivative of the male hormone,
testosterone.
</P>
<P>
Efficacy of the treatment was measured in men who became either
azoospermic, which means in whom sperm was not detectable in
semen, or oligozoospermic, which means in whom sperm
concentrations were lower than three million per millilitre of
semen.
</P>
<P>
Results of the trial showed that no pregnancies occurred in the
partners of men rendered azoospermic by the treatment and only 4
pregnancies occurred in partners of men rendered oligozoospermic.
</P>
<P>
However, as the WHO pointed out, the need for weekly injections
required by the new method could prove to be a drawback. Therefore
the WHO is studying longer-acting testosterone derivatives as well
as combined hormonal preparations which will have the dual
advantages of a longer interval, three to four months, between
injections as well as a lower overall hormone dose.

minerals in Ethiopian eastern Dire Dawa region, the Ethiopian

Mehamed Hassen, head of the regional economic development

However, Mehamed said no measure has been taken at the

development of these minerals because a bureau responsible for
this purpose has not yet been established.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, April 2 (Xinhua) -- French Defense Minister
Charles Millon arrived in Riyadh today to discuss with Saudi
officials the Gulf security and defense relations between France
and Saudi Arabia, Kuwait News Agency said.
</P>
<P>
According to reports of Kuwaiti News Agency (KUNA) monitored
here, Millon would tackle defense cooperation with Saudi Arabia,
including an agreement signed in 1994 on Saudi Arabia's purchase
of two french frigates.
</P>
<P>
The two sides will also discuss establishing a naval base and
launching a training program for Saudi personnel.
</P>
<P>
The defense cooperation program between both countries, titled
"A-Sawari," was estimated at 19 billion Francs (3.8 billion
Dollars).
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the French Minister will try to increase
his country's opportunities in winning a sale deal of "Leclerc"
tanks which the Saudi forces had tested during exercises last
summer.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi side was keen to test the British tank challenger
next summer, in addition to the U.S. Abrams tanks which Saudi
Arabia had requested to purchase.
</P>
<P>
The French Minister's visit is his second trip to the country
in less than six months, which also falls in the preparation for
a visit by French President Jacques Chirac later this year.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Economy Seen Smallest Growth Since 1991 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 2 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. economy grew just 2
percent last year, the smallest advance since the last recession,
the U.S. Commerce Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department said the revised gross domestic product
(GDP)--the total output of goods and services within the United
States-- was weaker than its initial 2.1 percent estimate. The
1995 performance was the most anemic since the economy actually
shrank 1 percent in 1991, the last year of the previous economic
downturn.
</P>
<P>
The GDP had shot up 3.5 percent in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The 1995 expansion was held back in part by a slim 0.5 percent
annual rate of growth in the final three months, down from the
original 0.9 percent estimate. It had grown at a 3.6 percent rate
from August through September.
</P>
<P>
The revision was due to less business investment, smaller
inventories and a smaller decline in the trade deficit than first
thought that offset more consumer spending than originally
estimated.
</P>
<P>
A measure of inflation tied to the GDP report showed prices
remained under control in 1995, rising just 2.5 percent and
including a 2.1 percent annual rate during the final three months.
</P>
<P>
Fourth-quarter economic growth was trimmed by a quarter
percentage point because of the two partial government shutdowns,
which some analysts have said would depress first-quarter growth
by a similar amount.
</P>
<P>
Consumer spending, two-thirds of the nation's economic
activity, increased just 1.2 percent in the fourth quarter
compared with 2.8 percent in the third quarter. Still, it was
stronger than the government's initial 0.8 percent estimate.
</P>
<P>
Business investments, a pillar of economic growth for much of
last year, increased at just a 3.1 percent rate in the fourth
quarter. It originally was reported up 6.2 percent. Still capital
spending rose 9.6 percent for the year, little changed from 9.8
percent in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The trade deficit also was wider in the fourth quarter than
initially thought. Although exports grew at an 11 percent rate
rather than 10.9 percent in the first estimate, imports rose by
1.3 percent instead of just 0.1 percent as previously estimated.
</P>
<P>
The government spending managed a 0.1 percent increase for the
year of 1995 after remaining unchanged in 1994. But it fell at a
4.1 percent rate in the last quarter rather a 3.7 percent rate
announced earliered.
</P>
<P>
Construction of new homes and apartments, which had plunged
during the first six months of 1995, rose modestly in the fourth
quarter--up 6.4 percent at an annual rate. The original estimate
was 6.8 percent. But for all of 1995, construction fell 2.3
percent, the first drop since the 1991 recession.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, recent economic data is giving mixed signals for
the present economic situation in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Index of Leading Economic Indicator, an important gauge of
future economic activity, rose by 1.3 percent, a sharp increase,
in February.
</P>
<P>
But the manufacturing index, conducted by the U.S. National
Association of Purchasing Management based on survey results,
showed the manufacturing was still in decline. The index improved
from 45.2 percent in February to 46.9 percent in March. But the
reading below 50 percent shows weakness.

<HEADLINE> Teachers Call for Checking School Violence by Society </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Association of Teachers
and Lectures (ATL) urged today to set up local groups in their
communities to tackle the worsening school violence.
</P>
<P>
In its annual conference in Torquay, Devon, the ATL told the
delegates that schools would be the starting point for dealing
with crime in society.
</P>
<P>
The association maintained that parents, police and church
officials could be organized into local groups to check the school
violence.
</P>
<P>
Now violence against teachers and false allegations of abuse by
pupils have been put high on the agenda at the Easter conferences
of Britain's teaching unioni.
</P>
<P>
The National Association of Schoolmaster/Union of Women
Teachers (NAS/UWT), the second largest teaching union in Britain,
in its annual conference to be held very soon, will call for the
disciplining of parents who encourage disruptive children to
misbehave.
</P>
<P>
Nigel de Gruchy, general secretary of NAS/UWT, said: "It is
better to wreck a car than to wreck a class if that's the choice."
</P>
<P>
It is reported that some teaching unioni will call for new laws
to ensure that schools invest in surveillance systems to protect
against intruders.

<HEADLINE> UK Manufacturing Industry Continues to Stagnate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 2 (Xinhua) -- British manufacturing industry is
continuing to stagnate and more companies are offering discounts
in an effort to drum up sales, according to the latest survey from
the Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply.
</P>
<P>
The institute's purchasing managers' index fell to 49.7 in
March from 49.9 in February. It was the second consecutive month
the index was below 50, which signals a decline in the sector.
</P>
<P>
Order books were subdued by weak domestic and export demand,
while one company in five reported a rise in stocks of unsold
goods.
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to offload some of these stocks, factories
slashed prices. The institute's prices index fell to 43.3 from
44.4 in February, the sharpest drop since July 1991, the month the
survey began.
</P>
<P>
The survey showed that firms reduced output in an attempt to
cut stock levels. The output index slumped to its lowest level
since October 1992.
</P>
<P>
The employment index fell for the third successive month as
companies laid off people in response to weak demand.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the result of the survey would help Chancellor of
the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke to argue for another cut in interest
rates.
</P>
<P>
But most analysts believed that the monetary meeting tomorrow
between Clarke and Bank of England governor Eddie George is too
soon to cut rates again.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Supreme Court on Appointment of Judges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 2 (Xinhua) -- The Supreme Court of Pakistan
today asked the government to fully implement its order on the
appointment of judges issued on March 20.
</P>
<P>
In a detailed judgment issued from Lahore, the metropolis of
Punjab province, the court said any appointment or confirmation of
high court judges without consulting the Chief Justice of Pakistan
would be violating the constitution and therefore invalid.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court pointed out that the appointments of some
judges in the High Court were not made in strict accordance with
the provisions of the constitution.
</P>
<P>
Some judges already appointed have not been made permanent and
this is again in violation of the constitutional requirements, it
said.
</P>
<P>
The judgment aims to make significant changes in Pakistan's
judiciary system, according to one observer here.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto told the National Assembly last
Tuesday that the government will implement the order of the
Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, she denied that there might be a political or
constitutional crisis sparked by the order.

<HEADLINE> Foreigner in Tibet Ordered to Leave China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, April 2 (Xinhua) -- State security departments of the
Tibet Autonomous Region ordered a foreigner travelling on a New
Zealand passport to leave China last September for her wrongdoing
in the region.
</P>
<P>
A recent issue of "Tibet Daily" publicized the case, quoting a
state security official in the autonomous region as saying that
spreading of rumors is old tricks often used by separatists.
</P>
<P>
Whoever jeopardizes state security will be punished in
accordance with law, the official stressed.
</P>
<P>
The foreigner who has been ordered to leave, Guy Cotter was
walking near the Potala Palace in September 2 of 1995 during the
30th anniversary of the founding of the autonomous region, he
recalled. People of different ethnic groups and Han nationality
were singing and dancing at the Potala Palace square during the
festival.
</P>
<P>
After Cotter returned to her hotel, she told the press that
hundreds of soldiers were hurrying to the square, where a bomb
exploded, on that day, and that she left because she couldn't
stand to see "the coming massacre."
</P>
<P>
She was forced to leave China on September 9 of last year,
after confessing to having been spreading rumors.
</P>
<P>
The official noted that facts will eventually dispel the
rumors, and that freedom of speech should not overstep the
boundaries of state security.
</P>
<P>
The paper also criticized the Dalai Lama for laying aside
religious activities, and holding on to the weak "magic weapon"
of spreading political rumors to preach for "independence for
Tibet".
</P>
<P>
All those who spread oral or written rumors by fabricating or
distorting facts in a bid to instigate acts aimed at splitting the
Chinese nation are bound to be punished according to law, the
official said.

<HEADLINE> Arafat: Peres' Referendum Call Violates Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) President Yasser Arafat today blasted at Israeli Prime
Minister Shimon Peres' proposal for a referendum before
signing an agreement with the Palestinians on the final status
of the occupied territories.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in Gaza, Arafat said that this proposal is completely
against everything agreed upon between the PLO and Israel.
</P>
<P>
Also today, PNA member Freih Abu Medein described the proposal
as a "death blow" to the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Another PNA member, Mohammud Nashashibi, told reporters in Gaza
that such a referendum is illegal.
</P>
<P>
"You can not call a referendum on territory and sovereignty
that belong to other people. This is the Palestinian territory
and it is the whole responsibility of the Palestinians to
resume sovereignty," he said.
</P>
<P>
In reaction, Peres expressed his surprise to the Palestinian
opposition to his statement.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters in Doha, the Qatari capital where he is
on an official visit, Peres said that there was no agreement with
the Palestinians on the way by which Israel will ratify the
accord on permanent settlement.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli Labor Party Knesset (Israel's parliament)
member Haggai Merom today defended Peres's declaration.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Israeli public is very much divided over
issues in the final status talks such as border, Palestinian
entity, Jerusalem and security arrangements, and therefore the
best way to approve the accord is a referendum.
</P>
<P>
Under the Oslo Accords between the two sides, the final status
negotiations are due to begin next month and will conclude by May
1999.

CAIRO, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Seventeen Egyptians who had been

waters returned home today.

Yemen would release the 11 Egyptian fishing boats it had impounded.

boats.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that there is a widespread phenomenon of
Egyptian fishing boats entering the waters of neighboring states.

<HEADLINE> UK-EU Negotiations Going on over Beef Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister John Major said
today progress is being made at the negotiations with the European
Union on the beef crisis by his government.
</P>
<P>
But the British prime minister reminded the parliament that the
talks had some way to go and may not be concluded today.
</P>
<P>
He said that the British Agriculture Minister Douglas Hogg and
the EU partners were considering a number of measures, but the
solution had to be found on a European scale.
</P>
<P>
According to a BBC TV report, the two sides are still
bargaining. The EU is apparently considering paying 70 percent of
the cost of any slaughter program, but Britain wants 80 percent
payment from the EU.
</P>
<P>
As a matter of fact, the report said, there is still no
substantive agreement on an overall program for dealing the
crisis caused by the EU's worldwide ban on British beef exports,
which has been considered a potential link between the BSE, known
as the mad cow disease, and its deadly human form CJD.
</P>
<P>
In order to help stabilize the market, which has been shaken by
the wave of the mad cow disease scares, European farm ministers
agreed to the European Commission buying 50,000 tons of beef.

<HEADLINE> Qatar, Israel to Establish Trade Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, April 2 (Xinhua)-- Qatar and Israel today signed an
agreement on establishing bilateral trade relations.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed in Doha by Qatari and Israeli
officials during the current visit of Israeli Prime Minister
Shimon Peres.
</P>
<P>
Peres, who arrived here earlier today to make the first ever visit to
the Gulf Arab country, also paid a two-day visit to Oman from
Monday to Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Israel has no diplomatic relations with all Gulf Cooperation
Council (GCC) states, which also groups Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain
and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).
</P>
<P>
However, Oman and Qatar have made advanced steps to establish
economic ties with Israel.
</P>
<P>
On January 27 this year, Oman announced that it signed with
Israel an exchange of notes on the establishment of trade
relations.
</P>
<P>
A statement of the Omani Foreign Ministry, carried by the
official Oman News Agency, said the step is aimed at boosting
bilateral and multilateral peace process in the Middle East for
the achievement of a just and lasting peace.
</P>
<P>
In December 1994, late Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin
made a ground-breaking visit to the Sultanate of Oman for talks
with his Omani counterpart Sultan Qaboos bin-Said.
</P>
<P>
The current Gulf trip by Peres will contribute to Israel's
expansion of economic ties with all GCC countries, and eventually,
to forging diplomatic relations, Gulf source said.

JERUSALEM, April 2 (Xinhua) -- The Ministerial Committee, set
up to examine ways of easing the weeks-long closure, decided
today to allow the flow of produce to and from the Gaza

Before the closure imposed on February 25 after terrorist
suicide bombings, the number of trucks transporting goods to and
from the strip reached as many as 750 a day.
</P>
<P>
The committee, formed by Minister of Public Security Moshe
Shahal, Minister of Agriculture Yaacov Tsur, Minister of
Environment Yossi Sarid and Deputy Minister of Defense Ori Orr,

<HEADLINE> U.S. Navy Widens Ban on Use of F-14s Afterburners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 2 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Navy has expanded a
ban on use by its hundreds of F-14 jet fighters of engine
afterburners to prevent a new wave of accidents, Navy officials
said today.
</P>
<P>
The decision to widen the ban on use of engine afterburners,
which help planes to accelerate to supersonic speeds, came after
finding evidence of overheating on an F-14 jet that recently
crashed off the U.S. coast.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, several U.S. Navy F-14s crashed during
training exercises and the Navy suspended flight of the jet
fighters for several days.
</P>
<P>
In late February, the U.S. Navy imposed a halt on afterburner
use at altitudes below 10,000 feet.
</P>
<P>
To address heightened safety concerns, the U.S. Navy announced
last month that it would spend 80 million U.S. dollars to install
improved digital flight controls aboard the carrier-based F-14s.
Another 3 million U.S. dollars is already in the Pentagon 1996
budget to install pressure sensor warning lights for engines on
F-14As.
</P>
<P>
Afterburners, mounted on the rear of engines, provide extra
thrust by mixing additional fuel with hot exhaust air. First
investigations have blamed some of the F-14 crashes on afterburner
failure, leading to a redesign of the afterburner's metallic liner
and change in the way fuel is introduced.
</P>
<P>
A U.S. Navy spokesman described the broadened restriction on
afterburner use as "a precautionary measure."

<HEADLINE> Paper: Technology May Give Helicopters Stealth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 2 (Xinhua) -- A breakthrough in smart
materials technology has the potential to make helicopters
radically more survivable in combat by making them stealthy, more
maneuverable and more reliable, the weekly U.S. Defense News
reported in its latest edition.
</P>
<P>
The report said that by altering the design of the rotor
assembly, which has largely unchanged since the birth of the
helicopter in the 1920s, helicopters may become 20 times more
stealthy, 30 percent more maneuverable, 15 percent faster and
drastically more reliable.
</P>
<P>
The paper predicted that should the design pan out, the 5.5
billion U.S. dollars world military helicopter market could be
turned upside down by the upstart technology within the decade.
</P>
<P>
As the new technology could make aircraft quieter, more
reliable and easier to maintain, it would likely appeal to the 1.5
billion U.S. dollars commercial helicopter market as well,
aviation experts said.
</P>
<P>
When Navy helicopters are working over water, they are easy
targets for enemy missiles.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Army has used different techniques to make helicopters
more stealthy, such as covering the actuators with a housing on
the developmental -66 Comanche armed reconnaissance helicopter,
and training pilots to use trees, valleys and ravines to hide
their presence.

MOSCOW, April 2 (Xinhua) -- The presidents of Russia and
Belarus signed here today a treaty of union linking the economic
and political systems of the two nations.
</P>
<P>
At the signing ceremony in the Kremlin, Russian President Boris
Yeltsin said that the treaty, by creating a new "Community of
Sovereign Republics," "opens a radically new stage in the history
of two sovereign peoples, two sovereign states."
</P>
<P>
He said that the union of the two Slav nations, which have a
common history and a common future, is of "great significance" for
the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS).
</P>
<P>
He declared April 2 a national holiday in Russia and Belarus to
celebrate the event.
</P>
<P>
Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko said that the treaty was
a historic step towards the integration of the CIS.
</P>
<P>
Under the treaty, which was concluded by the two presidents on
March 22, Russia and Belarus will coordinate their foreign
policies and positions on major international affairs, and draw up
common principles on military development and the use of military
facilities.
</P>
<P>
The two countries will also cooperate in defence, safeguarding
their border and fighting crime.
</P>
<P>
The agreement calls for the two countries' economic reforms to
be synchronized before 1997 to pave the way for a common economic
zone, where the free flow of commodities, capital, labor and
services will be guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
The union will eventually have a common constitution, budget
and currency.
</P>
<P>
Three supra-national institutions will be established to govern
the union: a supreme council made up of the two countries'
presidents, prime ministers and parliament leaders, a standing
executive committee and a joint parliament.
</P>
<P>
But the treaty stops short of creating a single state and the
two countries will maintain their sovereignty, independence and
territorial integrity.

(MARCOPPER) for allegedly causing an ecological disaster in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Since March 24, some 2.4 million metric tons of mine tailings
from the MARCOPPER have escaped into the Boac river, isolating
several villages and endangering the health of thousands of
families in Marinduque, some 160 kilometers south of Manila.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Victor Ramos ordered the indefinite suspension of
the operations of the MARCOPPER in the country, including a mining
exploration in Diwalwal, Davao, and other mining applications.
</P>
<P>
He also ordered MARCOPPER mining officers, two foreign
executive officers in particular, to be barred from leaving the
country while the investigation is going on.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with reporters today, he said he is willing to
resign should investigators establish his liability for the
Marinduque tragedy.

HONG KONG, April 2 (Xinhua) -- General Accident Group, one of
Britain's largest composite insurance companies, announced here
today that it will open a representative office in Shanghai with
the approval of the People's Bank of China.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the group said that the opening of the new

group's long term investment plans in China.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said General Accident's clients, particularly
those in Hong Kong, are expanding their businesses in China. The
addition of the Shanghai office will boost its presence in China
and allow the group to provide the best possible support for both
its existing clients and the expanding market in China.
</P>
<P>
General Accident has operations in 14 Asian markets and a
strong insurance network in Hong Kong following the purchase of

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 2 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong
Governor-in-Council has approved the grant of a new franchise to
Citybus Limited (Citybus), conferring upon the company the right
to operate a public bus service for 10 years from September 1,
1996.
</P>
<P>
A government spokesman said here today that the grant of the
franchise is in accordance with the consensus reached by the
Sino-British Joint Liaison Group on the matter last month.
</P>
<P>
He said that a number of changes and several new provisions
were incorporated into the new franchise, including a new
requirement for a mid-term review.
</P>
<P>
The mid-term review is to be conducted after the fourth year of
the new franchise, he added.
</P>
<P>
Based on the outcome of such a review, the Governor-in-Council
may amend the terms of the franchise with the consent of Citybus,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Founded in September 1993, Citybus is one of the four
franchised bus operators in Hong Kong. It operates 35 routes on
Hong Kong Island and, jointly with Kowloon Motor Bus Company, four
cross-harbor tunnel routes.

<HEADLINE> New Trading Record Set for Rolling Forex in Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 2 (Xinhua) -- A new trading record for Rolling
Forex was Monday at Hong Kong Futures Exchange (HKFE) with a total
of 1,625 contracts traded, a spokesman of the HKFE said here
today.
</P>
<P>
The total underlying value of the contracts, including 1,238
contracts on the Japanese Yen and 387 contracts on the Deutsche
mark, reached 81.75 million US dollars, he said.
</P>
<P>
Rolling Forex was launched five months ago on November 3, 1995
by the HKFE. Although there was a drop in the second month, the
volume has been picking up steadily.
</P>
<P>
Ivers Riley, chief executive officer of HKFE, said that the new
record is a reflection of the growing support for this new product
and an increasing volume of trade is expected to be done by the
retail investors.
</P>
<P>
He said that another encouraging sign was the consistent narrow
spread.
"Between 9:00 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. on the last trading day, the
spread for the Yen Contract was maintained at 2 points most of the
time, even at 1 point on some occasions," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The narrow spread was mainly due to an aggressive pricing
approach of a Registered Trader," he added.
</P>
<P>
Rolling Forex is the first currency futures product introduced
by the HKFE and the first product traded electronically on HKFE's
newly installed automated trading system.

<HEADLINE> Qiao: Taiwan Issue Brooks No Foreign Interference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 2 (Xinhua) -- China's top legislator Qiao Shi
said here today that the Taiwan issue is purely China's internal
affair which brooks no interference by foreign powers under
whatever pretexts and through whatever means.
</P>
<P>
"Under no circumstances will the 1.2 billion people of China
allow Taiwan to be separated from China," said Qiao, Chairman of
the Chinese National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with major Russian news organizations, Qiao,
who arrived here Sunday on a six-day official visit, said China
hopes to settle the Taiwan issue through peaceful means but will
make no commitment not to use force.
</P>
<P>
"No forces can shake our position of defending our national
sovereignty, unification and territorial integrity," Qiao said.
</P>
<P>
He said the Chinese NPC, which has approved a number of laws
such as one on the protection of investment by Taiwan compatriots,
will continue to play its part in the reunification of the
motherland.
</P>
<P>
Qiao, who met with Russian President Boris Yeltsin Monday, said
China appreciates Russia's one China policy, noting that Russia
recognizes the government of People's Republic of China as the
sole legitimate government and pledged not to develop official
relations with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Besides Yeltsin, Qiao also met with Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin and speakers of both houses of the Russian parliament.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Qiao and his entourage toured the Red Square,
the Tretyakov Gallery and the Poklonnaya Gora Memorial, which
opened May 9, 1995, to mark the 50th anniversary of the victory of
the war against Nazi Germany.
</P>
<P>
The Tretyakov Gallery, which houses a collection of more than
100,000 art works of different historical periods, reopened about
a year ago after 10 years of renovation.
</P>
<P>
Qiao flew in from Kiev, Ukraine, on Sunday after a visit to
that country. After Moscow, he will go to St. Petersburg,
Russia's second largest city.
</P>
<P>
He will then fly to Greece for a stop-over before going on to
Cuba, and then Canada.

<HEADLINE> Han Xue Tops 100m Breaststroke Finals at Olympic Trials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, April 2 (Xinhua/OANA) -- Han Xue, world short course
50-meter breaststroke record holder, edged Yuan Yuan to chalk up
the women's 100-meter breaststroke title on the second day of the
China's Champions' Tourney here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Han, who turns to 15 in September, splashed ahead for her
winning time of one minute 09.83 seconds, edging out the 200-meter
breaststroke national record holder Yuan to the second at 1:09.96.
</P>
<P>
Han ranked fourth after the heats this morning whereas Yuan was
atop at 1:10.64.
</P>
<P>
Han, a native of Beijing, became a teenager sensation this
January when she shattered the 50-meter breaststroke short course
world record twice in a span of four days in Hong Kong and Beijing
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Veteran Yuan, from Southern Guangdong province, said after the
match that she was still confident of her own power for the
upcoming Olympics.
</P>
<P>
"All I want to do is how to coordinate better with my coach and
to score better results at Atlanta," the world silver medalist
said.
</P>
<P>
She figured out her arch-rivals at the Olympics as South
African Penny Heyns and Australian drug-tainted Samantha Riley.
</P>
<P>
Heyns rewrote the world record with a time of 1:07.46 on March
4, 1996 at the South African National Championships in Durban.
</P>
<P>
Yet, Dai Guohong, Asian record holder of the event, had bowed
out from the national squad due to her conflict with coach Lu
Yongming, which gave a heavy blow to the Chinese team.
</P>
<P>
Dai set the Asian mark of 1:08.51 at the seventh National Games
in Beijing in July, 1993.
</P>
<P>
"Her withdrawal will directly affect our power," said Chen
Yunpeng, former head coach of the Chinese swimming team, "not only
in the individual events, but also in the medley relay."
</P>
<P>
Shan Ying and Chen Yan shared the top honors in the women's
200-meter freestyle at 2:00.24. It was the second golds, both for
Shan, 18 and Chen, 15.
</P>
<P>
World champion Le Jingyi was third at 2:00.39
</P>
<P>
Early, Shan edged Le for the 100-meter freestyle title in the
night of Monday while Chen took away the 400-meter individual
medley.
</P>
<P>
Chen, winner at the Urban Games last October in Nanjing,
Jiangsu province, showed her all-around talent in many event such
as individual medley, butterfly and freestyle.
</P>
<P>
"But her best event is the freestyle," said coach Han Bingyan,
"We will concentrate on the event in the pre-Olympic training."
</P>
<P>
Shan's coach Zhou Zewen also nodded his satisfaction for her
performance, saying that "she is at her top form."
</P>
<P>
Shan grabbed the women's 100-meter freestyle laurel at the
Hiroshima Asian Games in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The men's 400-meter individual medley title went to Wang
Haizhou, with a time of 4:29.57.
</P>
<P>
The men's 4x200-meter freestyle relay was taken away by the
Shanghai quartet at 7:43.86, some 13 seconds slower that the
national mark of 7:30.26.
</P>
<P>
The women's 400-meter freestyle, 100-meter backstroke and men's
100-meter freestyle, 200-meter butterfly will be competed on
Wednesday.

<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, April 2 (Xinhua) -- More than 10,000 cars worth 23
billion forints (about 170 million U.S. dollars), mostly luxury
models, were stolen in Hungary in 1995 and the number is expected
to rise this year, police authorities said.
</P>
<P>
Together with drug trafficking and prostitution, car theft has
become one of the easiest ways of making big bucks for criminal
gangs which are increasingly rampant in Hungary.
</P>
<P>
About 8,000 of the 12,130 missing cars in 1995 were stolen in
the capital. Imported brands like Mercedes, Audi, Volkswagen and
BMW are popular with the thieves because they are easier to sell
once transported into Russia and Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
The police sources said that there are about 2,000
specially-trained car thieves in the country, belonging to 10 to
15 big syndicates.
</P>
<P>
Newspapers have accused customs officers and policemen of
taking bribes from the syndicates to turn a blind eye to their
criminal activities.

recently exported 1,525 "Jiefang" trucks to Myanmar, as the first
big export of Chinese motor vehicles ever by a Chinese auto
manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
The FAW is one of China's top automotive producers, and is
expected to produce 700,000 motor vehicles by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
According to long- and medium-range development plans, domestic
automobile supply will mostly meet demand.

FAW exported 500 motor vehicles to Myanmar in 1990, and found a
ready market in the country.
</P>
<P>
According to a contract signed this year, FAW will export 1,800
motor vehicles to Myanmar and, moreover, it will export 200 9-ton
dump trucks as well.

<HEADLINE> China TV Series to Preserve Traditional Art Forms (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chen expressed the belief that the TV series will also be
valuable for researchers and collectors because his crew is made
up of some of China's elite in film industry.
</P>
<P>
"The chief scriptwriter is Luo Shiping, deputy dean of art
history at the Central Academy of Fine Arts. The chief camera-man
is Zhang Huijun, deputy head of the photography department of the
Beijing Film Academy, and was a college classmate of Zhang Yimou
(the director of the film 'Red Sorghum')," he said.
</P>
<P>
He explained that Gao Zhanxiang, vice-minister of culture, is
the chief consultant for the TV series and that the board of
consultants includes outstanding figures of calligraphy and
painting circles and the heads of two art museums.
</P>
<P>
And finally, Chinese, Japanese, and English versions of the TV
series will be produced.
</P>
<P>
To fund continued work on the TV series, Chen said, he will go to
Hong Kong at the end of May to meet with representatives of major
TV stations from Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan and Singapore. He
estimates that the 60-part series will cost his company more than
three million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Chen will organize a group of Chinese calligraphy masters and
painters to go to Hong Kong, Macao, and elsewhere to show their
personal collections around the beginning of July, as way to
promote the series.
</P>
<P>
"The TV series will no doubt be successful, and hopefully, we
can get back part of our investment. Overseas Chinese are sure to
be interested in the TV series," he said.

<HEADLINE> China TV Series to Preserve Traditional Art Forms (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 2 (Xinhua) -- A 60-part TV series, "Chinese
Masters in Calligraphy and Painting," is being produced to
preserve the traditional arts of calligraphy and painting.
</P>
<P>
Chen Chen, producer of the series and general manager of
Beijing's Noah Economic and Cultural Development Company, said
today that 20 parts of the series have been completed.
</P>
<P>
These 20 reflect his desire to preserve China's traditional
art, which could disappear if no steps are taken immediately,
because the 20 masters being portrayed are quite old.
</P>
<P>
Among these are two painters, 105-year-old Zhu Qizhan from
Shanghai and 93-year-old Dong Shouping from north China's Shanxi
Province.
</P>
<P>
The producer has been keen on Chinese calligraphy and painting
since childhood and has a large personal collection. He expresses
his regret for the loss of some of China's cultural heritage, and
explains that the series is, "truly rescue work."
</P>
<P>
"Gai Jiaotian, a famous Peking Opera actor, was known as 'a
living Wu Song' (a legendary Chinese hero about 1,000 years ago),
but no visual records of him remain and the few cassettes are of
little use for study purposes," Chen noted. "It's a real pity!" he
said.
</P>
<P>
He has been brooding about just such a TV series since he
graduated from the Beijing Film Academy in 1991, he said.
</P>
<P>
The other 40 parts that are yet to be completed are in two
segments, one dealing with artists who are no longer alive, the
other with younger contemporary masters.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that the TV series will depict the inner world of the
artists from different angles and reflect their unique views on
art, helping the audience understand more about different types of
art.
</P>
<P>
"This TV series will also be lovely because it is a superb
blend of music, lighting, landscape, and the artists themselves,"
he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Emir of Qatar Sheikh Hamad bin
Khalifa al-Thani and visiting Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres
today held official talks in the Qatari capital of Doha soon after
the latter's arrival.
</P>
<P>
This is the first visit by an Israeli head of government
to the Gulf Arab country.
</P>
<P>
During talks, Sheikh Hamad and Peres mainly discussed issues on
developing bilateral relations and boosting cooperation, and the
two leaders agreed to establish commercial representative offices
in each other's capital so as to promote economic links, according
to reports reaching here from Doha.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders exchanged views on some other issues of mutual
concern, especially the Middle East peace march and barriers in
its way.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Hamad and Peres pledged their commitments to
bolstering the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Hamd expressed his anxiety over a blockade Israel
imposed in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, reaffirming the necessity
of lifting the closure and his country's support to the
Palestinian Authority.
</P>
<P>
This is second leg of Peres' two-day visit to the Gulf, which
has taken him to Oman.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Peres held a meeting with Omani leaders in the
country's southern resort city of Salalah, 1,000 kilometers from
Muscat.
</P>
<P>
Oman and Qatar are members of the Gulf Cooperation Council
(GCC), which also groups Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain and the
United Arab Emirates (UAE).
</P>
<P>
Israeli political sources said Peres hoped that the photographs
taken of him with Gulf Arab leaders would show Israelis that his
dream of a new and peaceful Middle East had already begun to be
realised.
</P>
<P>
Sources in the Gulf said Peres' current visit will
contribute to an establishment of commercial and political ties
with the GCC country in the future.

<HEADLINE> Fate of 11 Hostages in Indonesia Still "Unclear" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 2 (Xinhua) -- The fate of the 11 hostages
kidnapped by the Free Papua Movement (OPM) on January 8 in western
Indonesia remains "unclear," said an Antara report reaching here
today.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted district military spokesman Maulud Hidayat as
saying that the military has so far got no information of the
release of the hostages, including four Britons and two Dutch
citizens.
</P>
<P>
However, he confirmed that contact between the mediator -- the
International Committee of the Red Cross -- and the OPM is still
going on.
</P>
<P>
The OPM kidnapped 26 hostages who were on a scientific
expedition in Mapnduma village, Irian Jaya, on January 8. It
demands the recognition of an independent state within Irian Jaya
by the Indonesian government.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian government has flatly rejected the demand as a
condition for the release of all the hostages.
</P>
<P>
Later, on separate occasions, the OPM set free 15 hostages,
including one German.
</P>
<P>
At present, the remaining 11 hostages are still in the hands of
the OPM in an undisclosed location in the deep jungles of Irian
Jaya.

<HEADLINE> S. Korean Contractors Held Responsible for Jakarta Flyover  Collapse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 2 (Xinhua) -- The Jakarta police today named two
executives of the South Korean Hanbo General Contractors as the
alleged responsible parties for the collapse of the Grogol
overpass that killed three workers and injured 18 others last
month.
</P>
<P>
Lt. Col. Iman Haryatna of the Jakarta Police Command said the
police are investigating the two South Koreans for possible
negligence in the collapse of the overpass.
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred on March 22 when a 500-ton section of the
overpass collapsed.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the accident took place after workers were
told by their supervisor to remove the scaffolding supporting the
section several days ahead of the recommended date.
</P>
<P>
The two men are identified as Kim Hyun Woo and Lee Byung Woo,
the general superintendent of the company and the construction
manager of the project.
</P>
<P>
According to Iman, the police reached the conclusion after
repeatedly interrogating Kim and Lee and questioning 22 witnesses,
including injured workers, security officers and local executives
of the project.
</P>
<P>
The two men have not been arrested yet but the local police
have taken their passports and prohibited them from leaving the
city.
</P>
<P>
If found guilty, the two men will face a maximum imprisonment
of five years under the Indonesian law.

<HEADLINE> Major Progress in Chinese Hi-technology Research </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 2 (Xinhua) -- China's Program 863 has led to
breakthroughs in key hi-tech research projects, narrowing the gap
between China and other parts of the world, a leading Chinese
science official said at a meeting on the program today.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Lilan, executive vice-minister of the State Science and
Technology Commission (SSTC), said that a total of 10 billion yuan
was earmarked for this "Hi-tech Research and Development Program,"
which was approved by the Central authorities in 1986 and is to be
completed by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
It was proposed by four prominent scientists in a joint letter
to the authorities on March 1986, suggesting that China keep a
closer watch on development of advanced technology in the rest of
the world, and make plans for its own hi-tech research program.
</P>
<P>
As a result, about 1,200 research findings have been made in
the fields of bio-technology, information science, automation,
energy, and new materials, 560 of which are in the forefront and
244 have been patented both in and outside China.
</P>
<P>
Successes have been made in improved strains of rice and
cotton, animal and plant gene transplanting, genetic-engineering
pharmacerticals and vaccines, massive parallel processing
computers with a speed of 2.5 billion calculations per second,
underwater robots, and robots for manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
Officials say about 38 percent of the achievements, which are
being used in commerce and national defence, have played or will
play a great role in agricultural and new product development, and
in transforming outmoded industries with start-of-the-art
technology.
</P>
<P>
Wang Tongyi, head of the Commission of Science, Technology and
Industry for National Defense, delivered a report on achievements
in the fields of space and laser technology.
</P>
<P>
He noted that about 5,600 scientists were doing research
nationwide in some 400 aspects of space studies. Some scientists
are doing experiments on such materials as protein crystals,
cells, microorganisms, and plant seed strains in space.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhu, Program 863 allowed China to set up hi-tech
research and development centers across the country, train 20,000
hi-tech researchers, and co-operate with more than 20 countries
over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
She said the program has not only raised the country's
technological standards but provided a firm basis for future
high-tech research.
</P>
<P>
Chinese leaders recently wrote inscriptions in celebration of
the 10th anniversary of the program. President Jiang Zemin wrote
"Gearing up for economic development and scaling the heights of
science and technology," and Premier Li Peng wrote "Developing
new, high-technology and increasing comprehensive national
strength."

TEHRAN, April 2 (Xinhua) -- A seven-member European Union
Troika delegation today began dialogue with Iran on crucial issues of
terrorism and the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
For the time being, however, there is no any comment from
either sides about the negotiations on terrorism and the Middle
East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The delegation took a special flight from Rome and arrived

Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
Tehran is the first leg of the EU delegation, which will
also go to Syria, Lebanon, Egypt and Israel.
</P>
<P>
Mario Panaro, Counsellor of the Italian embassy in Tehran,
told Xinhua that the Troika delegation is headed by Italian
Foreign Ministry Undersecretary Ludovico Incisa di Camerana.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that the visit by the EU delegation
is crucial for the relations between Iran and the European
countries, which are seeking to persuade the Iranian government
to unequivocally condemn and disassociate themselves from terrorist
attacks.
</P>
<P>
The EU officials will hold talks with Iranian Foreign Minister
Ali Akbar Velayati Wednesday morning. This afternoon, they will
hold talks with Velayati's deputy for Euro-American Affairs
Mahmoud Vaezi.
</P>
<P>
The Italian Undersecretary is accompanied by Spanish Foreign
Ministry Director General of the Middle Eastern Affairs Miguel
Angel Moratinos and Irish Foreign Ministry Director General for
Middle Eastern Affairs Kenneth Thomson.
</P>
<P>
The Troika visit to Iran is taking place in light of a
decision made by European foreign ministers in their March 9-10
meeting in Palermo, Italy.
</P>
<P>
The European Union will not bow to U.S. pressure and abandon

<HEADLINE> Foreign Technology In China's Fast Food Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 2 (Xinhua) -- An international exhibition of
fast food equipment opened here today, with one exhibitor, the
Harbin General Commercial Machinery Plant, China's first
dumpling-machine manufacturer, announcing that its dumpling
machines have always been selling well in China.
</P>
<P>
The Harbin plant demonstrated one machine capable of making
7,200 dumplings per hour. The retail price is more than 9,000 yuan
(1,084 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Fast food experts from all over the country discussed ways of
improving the industry today at seminar which ran concurrently
with the exhibition.
</P>
<P>
Foreign technology is making headway in China's expanding
fast food market, though lower-priced traditional Chinese products
still dominate.
</P>
<P>
One foreign competitor at the exhibition hall was the Beijing
Daiei Food Machinery Co., Ltd. which is a solely-Japanese-backed
enterprise. It's selling a dumpling machine with an hourly
capacity of 12,000. Though its price runs as high as 900,000 yuan,
the machine has been selling well in south China, a company source
claimed.
</P>
<P>
Another exhibitor, Shenyang's Scotsman Xinle Refrigeration
Equipment Manufacturing Co. Ltd., has an ambitious plan to take a
large slice of the ice machine market not only in China but also
in Asia and the Pacific region eventually. The joint venture's
foreign partner is the US's Scotsman, which is known as the "king
of ice machines".
</P>
<P>
The rising standard of living and faster-paced life have pushed
demand for fast food to an unprecedented height.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the country's total fast food sales reached 30 billion
yuan. There are about 280,000 fast food outlets, over 400 fast
food companies, and over 2,000 chain stores across the country.
</P>
<P>
However, the quality of goods and management ability in the
industry are still not as good as those of overseas counterparts,
experts said.

<HEADLINE> South Korea to Ease Terms of Loans for Developing Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, April 2 (Xinhua) -- South Korea will ease the terms of
its Economic Development Cooperation Fund (EDCF) loans to
developing countries to support South Korean firms seeking to make
inroads into those countries, the Finance and Economy Ministry
said today.
</P>
<P>
The terms of EDCF loans have so far been stiffer than those of
official development assistance loans offered by developed
countries, making it more difficult for South Korean firms to do
business in developing economies, a ministry official said.
</P>
<P>
Under the ministry's plan, the average repayment period will be
extended from the current 20.5 years, including a grace period of
5.2 years, to 29 years with a 8.8-year grace period.
</P>
<P>
The average annual interest rate will also be lowered from the
current 3.2 percent to 2.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
The new terms are comparable to the 29-year repayment period
and 2.7-percent interest rate offered by the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the so-called club of
rich countries.
</P>
<P>
Seoul will set aside 400 million U.S. dollars for EDCF loans
this year, more than double the 180 million dollars approved last
year, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The EDCF was established by the South Korean government in 1987
and has extended loans worth 639.7 million dollars to 45 projects
in 21 countries.

<HEADLINE> Ghali: U.N. Ready to Mediate Between DPRK, South Korea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, April 2 (Xinhua) -- United Nations Secretary-General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali said here today that the U.N. is ready to
mediate between South Korea and the Democratic People's Republic
of Korea (DPRK).
</P>
<P>
At a press conference before concluding his six-day visit to
South Korea, Boutros-Ghali said the U.N. will act as mediator if
both Seoul and Pyongyang agree to the idea.
</P>
<P>
He said that the U.N.'s long-term objectives for the Korean
peninsula encompassed the replacement of the 1953 armistice
agreement with a peace treaty and eventual reunification of the
two Koreas.
</P>
<P>
"Once the reunification of the Korean peninsula happens, Korea
will have a greater impact on world affairs, on peace, on
development and on the democratization of international
relations," he said.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK and South Korea could solve their problems peacefully
through negotiations and dialogue, he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that he would visit Pyongyang at a later date and will
make a third trip to Seoul next year.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief visited both South Korea and the DPRK in 1994,
when he met with late DPRK leader Kim Il-sung in Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
Boutros-Ghali arrived here on March 28.

FREETOWN, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Former second Vice-President
Joseph Dauda was ordered free from house arrest by new President
Alhaji Tejan Kabbah on Monday, state radio said today in a
special announcement.
</P>
<P>
Along with him being set free were two former government
ministers, Bu Buake Jabbie and Leonard Fofana, in the civilian
government of Joseph Momoh which was toppled in 1992 by the
military government.
</P>
<P>
Kabbah also ordered the release of 66 people described as
"rebel suspects" who had been detained for more than a year in
the maximum security prison in the capital.
</P>
<P>
All were detained by the military government which handed over
power to Kabbah last Friday.
</P>
<P>
The detained ministers were stripped of all national awards
and their properties seized after a commission of inquiry had
accused them of corruption.
</P>
<P>
The radio announcement said the detainees "were not released
as a prejudice to the (former military ) government nor a move
against it."
</P>
<P>
Political observers said the release of the rebel suspects
"can be seen as a gesture to the Revolutionary United Front"
(RUF) whose leader, Foday Sankoh has signaled his willingness to
hold "continued talks" with Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources said the talks in Cote d'Ivoire will be
held on April 15.

<P>
HONG KONG, April 2 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Polytechnic
University (PolyU)'s Industrial Center officially opened its
Photochemical Machining (PCM) facilities today, which is the first
of its kind to be installed in universities in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The new PCM facilities, costing 3 million HK dollars, will be
used not only in the research and product development activities
at PolyU, but also in providing manufacturing support services for
industry, according to Prof. Wong Sook-leung, vice-president of
the university.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony of the PCM Workshops, Wong
said, "the industrial center's strategic decision to introduce PCM
 into their portfolio of activities is based upon their desire to
feature this important modern technology in their undergraduate
training programs and also on their willingness to improve and
expand their level of unique service to Hong Kong's industrial
enterprises."
</P>
<P>
Photochemical machining is a modern sheet metal working process
with a number of distinct advantages over traditional methods.
Applications of PCM technology are virtually limitless, according
to sources from PolyU.

NEW DELHI, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Communication and infrastructure
problems are hampering the expansion of trade between India and
Bangladesh, Indian External Affairs Minister Pranab Mukherjee said
here today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a seminar on the partnership between Bangladesh and
India, Mukherjee said the two countries would have to make efforts
to achieve a big leap in their commercial integration.
</P>
<P>
He said it is time now for India to give Bangladesh a virtually
zero tariff for access into the Indian market, except for a few
items.
</P>
<P>
A freer flow of goods will be particularly useful in India's
north-eastern region in the long run while there is a wide scope
for bilateral cooperation in the fields of energy management and
environment management, Mukherjee noted.
</P>
<P>
He said the development of the South Asian Free Trade
Association (SAFTA) in the 21 century should match the
achievements of other regional groupings.

WASHINGTON, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Germany's Uta Pippig will
defend her title for the second time against 13 other top runners

</P>
<P>
Pippig, 30, registered two of last year's best times for
women's marathon when she won the Boston event in two hours, 25
minutes and 11 seconds, and clocked 2:25:36 for the Berlin title.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Hyacinth Threat Arrests Uganda (Part Two) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(By Cai Guozhong)
</P>
<P>
KAMPALA, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Water intakes for Kampala,
capital of the country and Entebbe, where the country's sole
international airport is located, are often clogged by the weed
masses, causing distuption in water pumping.
</P>
<P>
The weeds have interfered with lake transport as well. Small
artisan boats are usually caught up in the weed masses and their
access to deep water or landings is blocked. The mass weed often
blcoks wagon ferries plying between ports on the lakes in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Another consequence is that large mats of water hyacinth are
destroying fish breeding grounds by depleting oxygen from water.
Fishing is already impossible in parts of the country's waters.
</P>
<P>
Many fishermen at Masaka landing site on the shore
of Lake Victoria have abandoned their business and turn to
other trades.
</P>
<P>
What is more, the shoreline of the lake has receded greatly
in recent years in the face of the massive invasing of the
weeds, which are causing water loss through evaporation three
times higher than before.
</P>
<P>
Scientists also believe that masses of the weed are
providing habitat for disease-carrying vectors like mosquitoes
and bilharzia snails.
</P>
<P>
In order to check the spread of the weeds, the Ugandan
government has planned to deploy five floating weed harvesters on
lakes Victoria, Kyoga, Albert and the Albert-River Nile waterway.
</P>
<P>
In late February 1995, the government made the decision: where
the weed proves stubborn, chemicals will be applied.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the countries around the lake including Tanzania,
Kenya and Uganda agreed on a joint strategy in January 1995 to
control the prolific weed. One of the steps to be taken under the
agreement is to introduce weevils in the lake.
</P>
<P>
Foreign donors, especially the United Nations Development
Program (UNDP), Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) and the
World Bank, have pledged to help Uganda get rid of the weed
calamity.
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of this year, UNDP, the United States and
Japan pledged a total of 2.6 million U.S. Dollars in aid to the
weed elemination efforts.
</P>
<P>
With the international assistance, the Ugandan government has
express the optimism that the weeds can soon be brought under
control.
</P>
<P>
Environmental pundits are also proposing that as a sustainable
way to check the spread of the weeds, both the destructive and
utilization methods be adopted. The weeds can be used to make
handicrafts and composite manure, they said.

<HEADLINE> HK Property Market on Mild Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 2 (Xinhua) -- The property market is on its
way to a mild recovery, with prices expected to rise by about 10
percent in 1996, according to the latest issue of Hang Seng
Economic Monthly.
</P>
<P>
A report in the monthly said that after falling about 30
percent from the peak of the cycle in April 1994, residential
property prices have stabilized since October last year. Some
popular housing estates in the private sector have even recorded a
five percent gain.
</P>
<P>
Transactions have also rebounded, with the number of sale and
purchase agreements increasing from an average of 8,000 per month
during the 18-month-long downswing to about 10,000 per month at
the end of 1995.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the turnaround of the property market was
brought on by a number of factors, including the fall in interest
rates and the bull run of the stock market. The improvement in
affordability of home purchases and the extension of the pre-sale
period for new flats from 9 to 12 months have also provided
further impetus to the market.
</P>
<P>
Home buyers have also benefited from the increased competition
for mortgage loans as banks offer attractive loan packages,
including lower mortgage rates, flexible repayment terms and
bridging loans, the report said.
</P>
<P>
It pointed out that the local property market has always been
underpinned by a strong underlying demand as a result of growing
population and limited supply of land.

<HEADLINE> Thieves Target Bags at HK International Airport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 2 (Xinhua) -- International crime syndicates
have been stealing travelers' baggage at Hong Kong International
Airport, the local police warned passengers.
</P>
<P>
Today's local media reports quoted the police as saying that
the professional gangs are mostly from the sub-continent or South
America.
</P>
<P>
Officer in charge of the airport task force, Senior Inspector
Ng Chun-piu, said 14 people were convicted of stealing baggage at
Kai Tak last year.
</P>
<P>
In 1995 the airport police received 149 reports of baggage
theft, dropping by almost half compared with 275 in 1994, but the
message of caution still needs to be hammered home to passengers,
Ng said.
</P>
<P>
He said many cases were caused by owners' ignorance, and some
people had as much as 300,000 HK dollars cash and jewelry stolen.
</P>
<P>
He said his 23-man task force was combining efforts with
airport security staff to clamp down further on crime at the
airport.

<P>
HONG KONG, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's property market
rebounded strongly last month, with the number of transactions
surging 30 percent to 11,900, which is the highest level since

number of deals of 8,120 per month, registered between May last
year and February at the Land Registry.

</P>
<P>
There were 2,204 new property deals and 8,813 deals involving
second-hand properties last month.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 2 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government has
instructed state-owned company Pt Pupuk Sriwidjaja (PUSRI) to take
over all fertilizer distribution lines, according to a decree
published today by Bek's Daily, an economic bulletin.
</P>
<P>
The decree, issued by the Ministry of Industry and Trade, aims
to prevent fertilizer shortages in the country caused by
distribution mismanagement, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Under the decree, the PUSRI is authorized to distribute all
kinds of fertilizers, including those for plantations, fishery,
animal husbandry and forestry.
</P>
<P>
The PUSRI, in practice, can ask cooperatives to distribute
fertilizers from regency storehouses to retailers and farmers.
</P>
<P>
But the PUSRI will be held responsible in case of any trouble
in the distribution of fertilizer.
</P>
<P>
There are now six fertilizer producers in Indonesia.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Hyacinth Threat Arrests Uganda (Part One) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(By Cai Guozhong)
</P>
<P>
KAMPALA, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Uganda's waters, occupying 17
percent of its territory, are under siege of an exotic plant
called water hyacinth and the aquatic calamity has arrested the
attention of the East African nation as well as foreign
countries.
</P>
<P>
Water hyacinth is a native of South America where it has been
kept under check by its natural enemies namely weevils. However,
with its spreading to other parts of the world, it has been
considered a serious aquatic threat which features quick growth,
but no natural enemies.
</P>
<P>
One mother plant of the water hyacinth could produce 250,000
offsprings in three months.
</P>
<P>
The weeds appeared on Uganda's lakes about 40 years ago. In
1956, they were first reported in neighbouring Sudan and
Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
It was not until the late 1980s and early 1990s that economic
declines, the deterioration of civil service and breakdown of law
and order gave the weeds massive access to Uganda:
</P>
<P>
A tiny mass of the weeds was discovered in Lake Kyoga in
central Uganda in 1987 by the incumbent commissioner for
fisheries in the Ministry of Agriculture, Animal Industry and
Fisheries, Dr. Orach-meza.
</P>
<P>
Five years later, people found a large amount of the weeds at
the outlet of River Kagera, the uppermost part of the Victoria
Basin. Through River Kagera, the weeds were blown downwords by
winds and current to the northern shores of the lake.
</P>
<P>
The floating weeds have since 1992 spread at alarming rates.
</P>
<P>
The weeds have now strangled 90 percent of the shoreline of
rivers and lakes, a stretch of about 2,000 km. The weeds are
covering all bays of Lake Victoria, Lake Kyoga, River Nile in
Uganda and, to a small extent, Lake Albert.
</P>
<P>
River Kagera alone injects about 45 tons of the weeds per 12
hours into Lake Victoria, where the weed population is now
self-sustaining. Besides, there are weed nurseries on the northern
coastline secured in sheltered bays.
</P>
<P>
The weeds have caused a calamity in Uganda in social and
economic areas.
</P>
<P>
In Jinja, 80 kilometres east of Kampala, the Owen Falls Dam of
the country's sole hydroelectic power station has since December
1994 been under siege of the weeds, which have resulted in power
interruptions.

<HEADLINE> Manila to Import More Corn to Stabilize Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 2 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Department of
Agriculture will import more corn if prices of the local corn go
up, a ranking agriculture official said today.
</P>
<P>
He noted that 250,000 metric tons of yellow corn are scheduled
to arrive this month to fill in the projected shortage in the
first six months of the year.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the department has a standby authority to import
additional 150,000 metric tons of corn to meet the domestic
demand.
</P>
<P>
But according to a press release of the National Federation of
Hog Farmers, representatives of hog-raisers and feed-millers have
placed the shortage at a much higher level of one million metric
tons.
</P>
<P>
The hog-raisers asked the Congress to include imported pork in
the coverage of the expanded value-added tax law as the high cost
of corn is making it difficult for local pork to compete with
imported pork.

<P>
MANILA, April 2 (Xinhua) -- The US auto giant, General Motors
Corp. (GM), is eyeing the Calabazon Industrial Area in the
Philippines for its planned regional manufacturing plant.
</P>
<P>
Trade and Industry Undersecretary Melito Salazar said today
that visiting senior GM executives are quite confident and
positive of one area as a possible site.
</P>
<P>
However, he declined to identify the preferred area.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, officials at the Board of Investments (BOI) said that
the GM had shortlisted three areas, including a site within
Calabazon and was inclined toward those with international port
facilities and other infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
Salazar also said that senior GM executives "seem satisfied"
with the package of fiscal incentives available for the project.
</P>
<P>
Among these are tax credits granted as an incentive for
improved export revenues and those normally given by the BOI to
export-oriented projects.
</P>
<P>
Manila and Bangkok are vying to host the one billion US dollars
plant, which will assemble about 100,000 passenger cars yearly and
employ over 1,000 people at the peak of operations.
</P>
<P>
GM officials said that a final site decision, expected sometime
in mid-April, will be based on a variety of factors, including
incentives and the general investment climate.

<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Shimon
Peres arrived in Doha today on the first ever visit by an Israeli
leader to the Gulf Arab state, hoping to expand trade ties with
Qatar.
</P>
<P>
Peres was greeted on arrival by Deputy Prime Minister and
Interior Minister Sheik Abdullah bin Khalifa Al Thani, Qatar's
second-in-command.
</P>
<P>
The two reviewed a guard of honor at the tarmac, and then went
to the seafront Emiri Diwan for a meeting with the emir, Sheik
Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani.
</P>
<P>
This is second leg of his two-day visit to the Gulf, which
included Oman.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Sultan Qaboos of Oman held a meeting with the
visiting Israeli Premier Peres in the country's southern resort
city of Salalah, 1,000 kilometers from Muscat.
</P>
<P>
A joint statement issued after the summit said the Qaboos-Peres
talks focused on regional issues and ways to boost bilateral
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Both Qaboos and Peres have expressed their willingness to
support the Middle East peace process and to promote bilateral
ties.
</P>
<P>
The Qaboos-Peres talks also focused on the Palestinian-Israeli
negotiations and the need to provide urgent regional and
international assistance to the Palestinian National Authority.
</P>
<P>
Qaboos expressed his deep concern over the current condition of
the Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
Israel imposed closure on the West Bank and Gaza Strip
following a wave of suicide bombing attacks in Israel since
February 25. The closure, which barred at least 60,000
Palestinians from getting to their jobs in Israel, has paralyzed
most Palestinian industry and provoked food shortages.
</P>
<P>
Peres expressed his determination to find ways and means to
overcome these circumstances, said the joint statement.
</P>
<P>
Qatar and Oman have established low-level trade ties with Israel.

<HEADLINE> Laos to Launch Two Satellites by 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, April 1 (Xinhua) -- A Lao-Thai joint venture "Lao-Star"
will launch two communication satellites by the year of 1998,
Laos' official news agency KPL reported today.
</P>
<P>
The two satellites are expected to enable Laos to have broad
and fast access to information and to greatly improve the
telecommunication services in that country.
</P>
<P>
The first satellite is planned to be launched in December 1997
and the second one at the end of 1998.
</P>
<P>
"Lao-Star," established in Vientiane last week, will provide a
fully-integrated multi-media network through satellites covering
services on broadcasting, newspaper publishing and digital data
communications services in Laos and the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
The Lao government holds 20 percent of the shares of the
company, while Thailand's Asian Broadcasting Communications
Network Ltd. controls the remaining 80 percent.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Import No Rice in 1996/97 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 2 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government has
decided not to sign any contracts for rice imports starting from
April 1, the beginning of the current 1996/97 fiscal year,
according to reports reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
The move aims to make Indonesia self-sufficient in rice, the
staple food of its population of 195 million, Chief of the
National Logistics Agency (BULOG) Beddu Amang said at a recent
seminar on agriculture in Semarang, Central Java.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Indonesia, the fourth biggest country in the
world in terms of population, will not have to rely on foreign
rice supplies.
</P>
<P>
He said the rice imports now underway in the country were based
on contracts signed last year.
</P>
<P>
BULOG, the agency responsible for the guarantee of enough
foodstuff storage and stable prices of daily necessities,
expressed confidence that the country would be able to achieve
self-sufficiency in rice supply.
</P>
<P>
It cited such means as using high-quality rice seeds, improving
fertilizer distribution and opening up new rice estates outside
Java to boost the country's rice production.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia had been the biggest rice importer in the world but
it became self-sufficient in 1984.
</P>
<P>
Its rice exports had exceeded imports until 1993, when it began
to rely partly on rice imports again.
</P>
<P>
BULOG signed contracts for huge rice imports last year to
prevent further rice shortages this year.
</P>
<P>
However, rice harvests across the country for the current
season -- which is expected to peak next month -- have shown
surprisingly favorable results.

<P>
BANGKOK, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Laos will introduce new laws this
month on the management of forestry, land and water resources,
said a report reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
The National Assembly of Laos is expected to approve the bills
at its session later this month, which are aimed at improving the
management and protection of natural resources and providing
guidelines for foreign investors and funding institutions.
</P>
<P>
The bills, if signed into laws, will give local authorities and
people more power to manage land, forestry and water resources.
</P>
<P>
Under the new bills, all Laotians will have equal opportunity
to acquire land, but the property cannot be transferred by selling
or renting to a third person.
</P>
<P>
The bills will bar anyone from using land for any
non-designated purpose, such as using farm land to plant trees.
</P>
<P>
The proposed laws will allow foreign investors to rent land
from the Laotian government for 30 years. But Laotians who fled
the country during the Indochinese conflict will have no right to
receive any land.

<HEADLINE> Kazakhstan's Economy on the Mend in 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA ATA, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Kazakhstan saw a slowdown in its
economic recession and achieved a general macroeconomic stability
in 1995, the State Committee For Statistics said today.
</P>
<P>
Kazakhstan's GDP declined to 992.5 billion tenges (about 15.3
billion U.S. dollars) last year, a drop of nine percent from
1994. The declining rate, however, was much lower than the
previous year's 27.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
Industry showed some signs of recovery in 1995, with the output
of natural gas, metallurgy and some other major sectors increased
significantly. Light industry and food industry, however, were
still on the decline.
</P>
<P>
Agricultural production dropped 21 percent from the previous
year, mostly due to the use of obsolete equipment, fund shortages,
and serious drought in the central and western parts of the
country.
</P>
<P>
Foreign trade topped 8.71 billion dollars last year, up 30
percent over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The inflation rate dropped dramatically to four percent last
year, from a monthly 23.5 percent for 1994.
</P>
<P>
The Kazakh government believes that it will curb recession
before long and realize an upturn in a couple of years.

BEIJING, April 2 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese Foreign Ministry
spokesman said here today that a precondition for the
establishment of diplomatic relations between China and South
Africa is that South Africa must sever its so-called "diplomatic
relations" with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
In response to a question concerning the issue at a routine
press conference, spokesman Shen Guofang said that China has so
far established a non-governmental organization in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
"However," the spokesman pointed out, "if South Africa is going

precondition that South Africa must first of all sever its
so-called `diplomatic relations' with Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
Shen noted that according to the UN resolution in 1971, Taiwan
is an inalienable part of China and the government of the People's
Republic of China is the sole legal government representing the
whole of China.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore all UN member states should respect and follow these
spirit of the UN." the spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> Libya, Sudan Missions In Mogadishu Demanded To Close </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Somali faction leader Ali Mahdi
Mohamed today demanded a complete closure of the diplomatic
missions of Libya and Sudan for the alleged roles in Somalia's
internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
The Chairman of the Somali Salvation Alliance (SSA) accused
both countries of supporting his arch rival, General Mohamed
Farah Aidid.
</P>
<P>
It is unfortunate that foreign islamic states are involved in
further distablizing Somalia, Ali Mahdi declared.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a meeting in North Mogadishu, which is under his
control, Mr Mahdi said they have all evidences that Sudan and
Libya have supplied General Aidid with financial and military
hardware in Baidoa.
</P>
<P>
There are Libyan and Sudanese military advisors to General
Aidid in Baidoa and South Mogadishu, according to the SSA
chairman.
</P>
<P>
General Aidid takes control of South Mogadishu, where is
situated the two missions.
</P>
<P>
Mr Mahdi called on the two governments to withdraw from their
action against the vast majority of the Somali people.
</P>
<P>
Both diplomatic missions of Sudan and Libya participated
in the inauguration of the government of General Aidid in South
Mogadishu in June last year.
</P>
<P>
They have also attended the oath ceremony and ministerial
seating of General Aidid's government. However, only Libya has
declared its support and recognition to General Aidid's self
proclamation.
</P>
<P>
The SSA is holding a conference for a third day in Lafweyn
Palace Hotel in North Mogadishu. More than 14 factions are
attending the alliance meeting.
</P>
<P>
Observers believe that the participants are planning to set a
day for what they will call a national reconciliation conference,
which is not likely to be joined by General Aidid or his
supportive factions.

<HEADLINE> Big Merger to Produce Another Telecommunication Giant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, April 1 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. SBC Communications Inc.
and Pacific Telesis Group today agreed to merge in a 16.7 billion
U.S. dollars deal, the first combination of two regional Baby Bell
phone companies of the country.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the combination will form the nation's
second-largest telecommunications company after AT&AMP;T Corp. and
mark the most significant phone-company makeover since the U.S.
Congress revamped the country's telecommunications laws on
February 8.
</P>
<P>
The new company will be able to offer a broader range of
communications services, something also made possible by the law.
</P>
<P>
The two companies are among seven formed from the 1984 break-up
of the old Bell System monopoly. Together, they will have 30
million phone lines in seven states, including California and
Texas.
</P>
<P>
The merged company, using the name of SBC, will have more than
100,000 employees, revenues of more than 21 billion U.S. dollars,
operating cash flow of 9 billion U.S. dollars, and income of
almost 3 billion U.S. dollars, according to a report.
</P>
<P>
The law removed prohibitions that prevented long distance
companies from entering the local phone business and vice versa.
Cable companies also were freed by the law to offer phone service.
</P>
<P>
SBC will acquire Pacific Telesis Group for about 39 U.S.
dollars a share at the current market value, which will amount to
16.7 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The corporate headquarters for the combined company will be in
San Antonio, where SBC has been based since 1993. The San
Francisco area, home of Pacific Telesis, will be the headquarters
for the company's long distance operation, Internet services and
international businesses, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Pacific Telesis is in the middle of a program to eliminate
10,000 jobs in its local phone operations by the end of next year.
SBC is the only Baby Bell company that hasn't slashed jobs.
</P>
<P>
Pacific Telesis serves California and Nevada while SBC serves
Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Missouri and Kansas.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Manila Sees Bright Future  for Electrical Machinery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 2 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' electrical
machinery sector experienced a great upsurge last year and will
continue to go up in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
Based on a survey by the National Statistics Office, the
electrical machinery sector's production index soared by 41.4
percent as of end-1995 from a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
The electrical machinery group's production growth rate was the
second strongest last year, next to the petroleum products.
</P>
<P>
According to industry experts, the upsurge of the Philippines'
electrical machinery sector was mainly spurred by the robust
manufacturing activity of big electronic firms and the growing
external demand for locally-assembled microcircuits and
semiconductor device.
</P>
<P>
Industry experts said that with more and more foreign
electronic giants infusing fresh capital for plant expansion and
upgrading, it may not be long before the Philippines emerges as
Asia Pacific's new hot spot for electronics and high-tech
investment.
</P>
<P>
Recently, giants in the electronics sector like Intel and
Toshiba have been on an expansion binge in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
They were all inspired by a more stable political environment,
improving infrastructure and a deep pool of inexpensive yet highly
skilled English-speaking workers, technicians, and engineers.
</P>
<P>
According to the Board of Investments in a separate report,
with more electronic firms infusing new capital and increasing
their output, the electronic sector's contribution to the
country's export receipts will continue to grow tremendously.
</P>
<P>
For the whole of 1995, the Philippines electronic exports hit
7.5 billion US dollars, a robust 50 percent increase over the
previous year's level.
</P>
<P>
The export value of electronic products accounted for about 44
percent of the total export income of the country for last year.

external demand for locally-assembled microcircuits and
semiconductor device.
</P>
<P>
Industry experts said that with more and more foreign
electronic giants infusing fresh capital for plant expansion and
upgrading, it may not be long before the Philippines emerges as
Asia Pacific's new hot spot for electronics and high-tech
investment.
</P>
<P>
Recently, giants in the electronics sector like Intel and
Toshiba have been on an expansion binge in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
They were all inspired by a more stable political environment,
improving infrastructure and a deep pool of inexpensive yet highly
skilled English-speaking workers, technicians, and engineers.
</P>
<P>
According to the Board of Investments in a separate report,
with more electronic firms infusing new capital and increasing
their output, the electronic sector's contribution to the
country's export receipts will continue to grow tremendously.
</P>
<P>
For the whole of 1995, the Philippines electronic exports hit
7.5 billion US dollars, a robust 50 percent increase over the
previous year's level.
</P>
<P>
The export value of electronic products accounted for about 44
percent of the total export income of the country for last year.

expected to replace the Financial Building in Pudong, Shanghai as
the tallest building in Asia.
</P>
<P>
The 68-storey steel-structured Diwang (King of the Land)

<HEADLINE> Wahdat, Taliban Partially Join Hands Against  Afghan Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 2 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan Hezb-i-Wahdat and
Taliban Militia joined hands in two provinces against current
President Burhanuddin Rabbani, a senior Wahdat official said
today.
</P>
<P>
In a long-distance telephone interview with Xinhua, Hajidil Jo,
 Wahdat representative in Peshawar, Pakistan, said that an
agreement in this regard had been signed by local leaders from
Wahdat and Taliban in Bamian and Kapesa provinces Monday.
</P>
<P>
Jo said that the agreement offered to form a commission to
probe into the killing of late Wahdat Chief Abdul Mazari, who was
shot dead by Taliban after being captured in Kabul fighting last
March.
</P>
<P>
At that time, Taliban explained that Mazari was killed by
Taliban guards because he was trying to escape.
</P>
<P>
Jo said that both sides also agreed to reopen the roads which
connect areas controlled by Wahdat and Taliban respectively in the
two provinces.
</P>
<P>
The local forces of Wahdat and Taliban in the two provinces
would support each other if Rabbani's government troops attacked
either of the two, he added.
</P>
<P>
Hezb-i-Wahdat is a member of Afghan four-party opposition
alliance which also includes Hezb-i-Islami (Hekmatyar group),
Junbush-i-Melli led by Rashid Dostum, and Nejat-i-Melli chaired by
Sibghatullah Mojaddedi.
</P>
<P>
Wahdat is a representative of the Muslim Shia group which has
influence in mid-western Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Taliban, mainly composed of the majority Pushto people in the
country, has controlled half of the Afghan territory and has been
pursuing the policy of non-alliance with all the other Afghan
parties.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani newspaper Frontier Post reported here today that
Taliban found an ally against Rabbani.
</P>
<P>
It quoted a Taliban spokesman named Wakil Ahmad as saying that
Taliban and Wahdat had made a cooperation deal in two Afghan
provinces Monday.
</P>
<P>
Jo stressed, "the agreement does not mean that Wahdat has
withdrawn from the four-party opposition alliance."
</P>
<P>
The agreement was not signed by high-level officials of both
Wahdat and Taliban, he said, adding that it would be effective
only in two provinces instead of the whole country.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that this new move would have limited impact on
the ongoing political and military standoff in Afghanistan.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Urged to Pay Dues to United Nations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 1 (Xinhua) -- The United States on Monday
was urged by a major U.S. newspaper to live up to its financial
commitments to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
"If Washington fails to come up with money solemnly promised by
three successive presidents, not only downsizing but capsizing the
U.N., it would be a moral and financial default by the
organization's principal founder," said the New York Time in one
of its editorials.
</P>
<P>
The paper urged the Clinton administration to make a compromise
with the Congress by folding any one three now-independent Federal
agencies dealing with arms control, information and foreign aid
into the State Department.
</P>
<P>
The Congress has agreed to a foreign affairs budget that
provides 823 million U.S. dollars instead of the requested 934
million U.S. dollars for dues, and the full 445 million U.S.
dollars for peace-keeping. But it insists in return of merging one
of the three above-mentioned agencies.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations is in arrears of 2.9 billion U.S. dollars,
with U.S. owing 1.6 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
"America's debt, which represents a default on a treaty
obligation, is an enexcusable embarrassment," said the New York
Time.

JOHANNESBURG, April 2 (Xinhua)-- At least 343 clinics will be

</P>
<P>
Medicines on an essential drugs list for primary health care
would be free of charge under the programme.
</P>
<P>

HOHHOT, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Pure drinking water has been made
available to more than 26,000 people in the Inner Mongolia
Autonomous Region whose previous sources of water had been
contaminated with arsenic.

<P>
Since 1993 residents in 13 townships of the Hetao area have
been reported to suffer from arsenic poisoning.

The case drew great attention from both the central and local
governments, and they poured more than 3.5 million yuan (about
421,000 US dollars) to treat water sources.
</P>
<P>
The First Hydrological and Geological Engineering Investigation
Institute of Inner Mongolia traced the geological environment
which produced water with a high amount of arsenic, and finally

<HEADLINE> Macao Chain Blasts Leave Seven Injured </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
MACAO, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Seven people including five women
were injured as a result of chain blasts on Monday in Macao, local
newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Macao Daily News says that seven people including shop
assistants, a security guard and a passer-by were injured
yesterday as a result of grenade attacks in two shops.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted witnesses as saying that a middle-aged man
threw a grenade into a gold shop named "Meng Ka" at about 1:00
p.m. yesterday, injuring five workers in the shop and a
pedestrian.
</P>
<P>
About 10 minutes later, a grenade exploded in another garment
shop also named "Meng Ka", injuring a woman worker surnamed Wong,
and breaking the glass door of the shop into pieces.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, bomb experts defused and exploded a grenade placed
at the door of a mansion of a well-known local Chinese businessman
after police received an anonymous call almost at the same time.
Nobody was injured in that case.
</P>
<P>
Another report in the "Tai Chung Pou" newspaper said that debt
disputes may be the cause of the chain blasts. It quoted Xie
Shuwen, president of the Meng Ka Group Company, as saying that
someone has owed him several million Patacas (one US dollar is
equal to 7.7 Patacas) after buying real estate from the group
company.
</P>
<P>
Xie claimed that when his company tried to demand the payment,
it was threatened of attacks.
</P>
<P>
According to the reports, the "Meng Ka" gold shop belongs to
the group company, but the "Meng Ka" garment shop has nothing to
do with the company, and may be mistaken for the same name.

BEIJING, April 2 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese capital has launched
an examination of some 4,000 limited or share-holding companies'

<HEADLINE> Chen Yunpeng: Americans Could Top Olympic Swimmer Tally  By sportswriter: Yan Xiaoxian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, April 2 (Xinhua/OANA) -- Former head coach of the
Chinese Swimming squad Chen Yunpeng said here on Tuesday that the
U.S. swimmers may sweep a total of 14-16 golds at this summer's
Atlanta Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
"The American swimmers are still very powerful," Chen said, who
retired at the end of last year and had moved back to Shanghai,
his native city, with his family.
</P>
<P>
Chen, 61, now an advisor of the Chinese swimming team, came
here specially for the seven-day tourney, which also serves as the
Olympic trial.
</P>
<P>
"Though no single national record was shattered at last month's
U.S. Olympic trial, the American swimmers are favoured in chalking
up golds in many events in Atlanta," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
He added, "We have entered into a pre-Olympic period, a stage
of adjustment, training and transition, so the results can not
prove anything."
</P>
<P>
Chen, part-time professor in Shanghai Communication University
and Guangzhou Sports College, said that the U.S. players will
also get some home-turf advantage during the Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
Chen admitted that Chinese younger swimmers had done well at
the Tianjin tourney, especially in the short-distance freestyle
events.
</P>
<P>
"The results are very important, it will influence not only the
individual events, but also the relays," Chen said. "I was
satisfied with the times of these youngsters."
</P>
<P>
Chen revealed that China would be the most hopeful gold
contender in five events -- the women's 50, 100m freestyle, the
100, 200m butterfly and the women's 4 X 100m freestyle relay.
</P>
<P>
In the case of doping, Chen said the United States and
Australia also have swimmers taking steroids.
</P>
<P>
"It is by no means a phenomenon in one country," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
"Now the anti-doping system are tightened, and Chinese swimmers
are becoming the object of the frequent flight tests by FINA,"
said Chen. "Under this situation, I have no doubt about the truth
of the results now set by our swimmers. I think they are 100 per
cent `clean`."
</P>
<P>
After his retirement, Chen also spares some time to learn
English in a University for the old people in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
"I want to improve my English, so I can directly collect more
foreign news on swimming for the Chinese squad," Chen said.

<HEADLINE> UN Peacekeeping Needs T0 Be Re-Looked, Says Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia said here today that
the issue of United Nations peacekeeping needs to be re-looked
against today's reality to prevent it becoming the exclusive
preoccupation of only a small group of financial powers.
</P>
<P>
When opening the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) inter sessional
meeting here today, Malaysian foreign ministry secretary general
Ahmad Kamil Jaafar said the peacekeeping might need redefining and
reshaping.
</P>
<P>
Ahmad Kamil said the end of cold war and the realities that
followed necessitated a complete re-look at the UN's peacekeeping
operations because it now no longer fell entirely under the domain
of the world body.
</P>
<P>
He said: "We now enter into a new era in which multinational
forces also undertake peacekeeping operations as in the case of
the Implementation Force (IFOR) which operates under NATO command
today in Bosnia-Herzegovina."
</P>
<P>
Such operations were not only a financial strain on the
countries concerned, especially the smaller ones, but also have
the effect of divesting peacekeeping operations to a small coterie
of countries.
</P>
<P>
"If operations such as these gain the upper hand, it will not
be long before peacekeeping becomes an exclusive preoccupation of
only those who have the financial backing. We certainly do not
want to see this happening," the secretary-general said.
</P>
<P>
Ahmad Kamil said peacekeeping was developed by the UN as an
innovative response to deal with conflicts between states.
"Whatever variation peacekeeping takes in the future, the role of
the UN should not be diminished," he added.
</P>
<P>
Peacekeeping operations should remain under the auspices of the
UN and guided by the decision of the world organization, he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
He said Malaysia's involvement in UN peacekeeping activities
goes back more than 35 years with the first being its
participation in UN operations in the Congo in 1960. Now, the
Malaysian armed forces, police and civilians have been involved in
17 peacekeeping operations in various parts of the world.

<HEADLINE> Iran Kills 2 Spies, Arrests 89 in One Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Iran announced here today that it
had killed two spies and arrested 89 others in southwestern
province of Khuzestan in the past 12 months.
</P>
<P>
Iran's official news agency IRNA today quoted Information
Minister Ali Fallahiyan as saying that all the 89 people were
working in Khuzestan for the Iraqi security forces.
</P>
<P>
"They had extensive activities in connection with gathering
intelligence, planting bombs and cooperating with the Iraqi
security services," Fallahiyan said.
</P>
<P>
IRNA said that five bombs were confiscated from the spies. The
two men killed were identified as Jalil Sharhani and Mohammad
Qane. They had been serving the Iraqi regime for years and were
engaged in operations in the interest of "the enemy."
</P>
<P>
The two men were also responsible for killing members of
Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) and the grassroots
mobilization forces known as Basij.
</P>
<P>
However, IRNA did not say how many IRGC or Basij members were
killed.
</P>
<P>
The two killed were also responsible for organizing a spy
network and setting bombs in the Iranian oil wells, IRNA added.
</P>
<P>
The Persian daily Salam reported that two of the people
arrested were involved in planting bombs in oil well No.158 and
oil well No. 237 in Khuzestan on September 21, 1995.
</P>
<P>
Fallahiyan said an additional 128 people involved in
smuggling arms into Khuzestan were arrested and some 3,000 arms
were confiscated from them.

<HEADLINE> Manpower Exports Earn 925 Million Dlrs For Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, April 2 (Xinhua)-- Manpower export is Sri Lanka's
single largest net foreign exchange earner which made 925 million
US dollars last year, Foreign Employment Bureau chief Nissanka
Wijeratne said here today.
</P>
<P>
Earnings (396 million US dollars) from housemaids employed in
the Middle East alone were greater than the income earned by
export of garments (377 million US Dollars), which is also a
steady foreign exchange earner for Sri Lanka, he said.
</P>
<P>
There were a total of 550,000 of Sri Lankans working abroad out
of which 400,000 were women employed as housemaids in the Middle
East.
</P>
<P>
To ensure the stability of the Middle east housemaids market it
will be made mandatory for all such employees to be given special
training in the future, said Nissanka Wijeratne, adding that
accordingly 15 training centers in Sri Lanka have been opened by
the bureau for the purpose.

as soon as possible.

<P>
BEIJING, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Nearly 300 handicapped people
gathered at a party at Beijing's Xiangyuan Match-Making Agency.
</P>
<P>
Eight match-makers also attended the party, providing
on-the-spot match-making services. It is the first match-making
agency for the handicapped in the capital.
</P>
<P>
According to a survey, there are 410,000 handicapped people
living in Beijing, who have limited access to social activities,
thus it is difficult for them to find spouses.
</P>
<P>
The Xiangyuan Match-Making Agency, located in the Chaoyang
District, started providing free match-making services to the
disabled in January this year.
</P>
<P>
Sun Gang, a disabled man who sought help from the agency three
months ago, excitedly told others that he had just married a girl
he met at the agency, which also presented a washing machine to
them as a wedding present.
</P>
<P>
At the friendship party 11 couples expressed interests in
further developing their friendships. Ren Yida, head of the
agency, said that it will go on providing such opportunities for
the disabled.

<HEADLINE> Israel Takes Preventive Steps against Mad-Cow Disease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Under the shadow of the
world-wide hysteria over England's mad-cow disease, the Israeli
Ministry of Health has reportedly decided to ask all cosmetic
importers and manufacturers for details on the raw materials used
to make their products.
</P>
<P>
This was announced in a statement after it was learned that
some cosmetic products are derived from gelatin and collagen made
from cows. The ministry said that it is in contact with the health
authorities abroad to find out what guidelines they have issued
regarding cosmetics and the mad-cow disease scare in Britain.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said that it had already come to know that the
course of "most of the ingredients is not cows and they do not
come from Britain." Collagen implants injected under the skin to
temporarily remove wrinkles come from the U.S. and not from
Britain, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the health and agriculture ministries, which for
years have imposed stricter policies regarding the import of meat
from the European countries, said that there is no immediate need
to make its policies even more stringent. If the World Health
Organization, which is meeting today or tomorrow for an update on
information about bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), makes
even more severe recommendations, Israel will take additional or
even more drastic measures.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on March 26, both the Israeli government and the
Palestinian Authority (PA) announced a ban on imports of British
beef after the British government's disclosure that 10 people who
contracted an incurable brain wasting disease probably got it from
eating taint British beef.
</P>
<P>
Israel imports frozen meat from 12 nations, two of which
reported incidents of BSE, which is thought to be transferred to
humans in the form of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), known as
mad-cow disease.
</P>
<P>
The PA released an anxiety-quelling message, saying that it
intends to carefully inspect all meat imports.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai to Clean up Suzhou River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 2 (Xinhua) -- This, China's biggest city is
planning to clean up the Suzhou River, a major river running
through the city, by the year 2010, according to an environmental
pollution control meeting.
</P>
<P>
Due to the discharge over a long period of time of both
industrial and domestic waste water into the river, the water
quality of the river has kept dropping. Since the 1960s the river
have been becoming blacker and more putrid.
</P>
<P>
In late 1980s and early 1990s, with support from the World
Bank, the city invested a total of 1.6 billion yuan in a waste
water treatment project. Now it treats one million tons daily.
</P>
<P>
Still, the river is far from being totally cleared up.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting a plan was drawn up to plant trees along the
river banks and to primarily improve the water quality within the
next two years. By the year 2000 the river will be totally
inaccessible to pollutants.
</P>
<P>
The meeting also decided to set up a special working group led
by municipal government leaders to deal with the river
pollution. A comprehensive plan will be worked out by the group
soon.

<HEADLINE> Fuel Price Hikes Slammed In Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Several Zimbabwean organisations
are criticizing the recent price hikes on fuel saying the
increases are "unrealistic".
</P>
<P>
The local press today quoted Chairman of the Midlands Branch
of Zimbabwe National Chamber of Commerce Peter Chanaiwa as saying
that fuel price has been raised twice this year without any
consultations with the southern African country's business
organisations.
</P>
<P>
"There was no consideration taken as to the repercussions of
such a move because every basic commodity and other services will
be affected by fuel increases," he argued.
</P>
<P>
The increases announced by the Ministry of Transport and
Energy on Sunday would further dent the already diminished buying
power of most workers, he added.
</P>
<P>
Consumer Council of Zimbabwe represetative Nerwande said, "the
recent price of petrol, diesel, paraffin and gas has further
marginalized the socio-economic status of the consumer and has
eroded their buying power."
</P>
<P>
Former president of the Midlands Chamber of Industries Jim
Pringle expected the recent fuel price increases to result in a
further decrease of the standard of living for every Zimbabwean.
The lowly paid would be hit the hardest, he warned.
</P>
<P>
Fuel prices went up by three to 20 percent this time in
Zimbabwe. The Ministry of Transport and Energy attributed the
rise to an 11 percent decline in the Zimbabwean Dollar against
the U.S. Dollar since July 1995.

<HEADLINE> Peres: Referendum to Approve Final Status Accords </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Shimon
Peres has announced that he wants to submit future accords with
the Palestinians on the final status of the occupied territories
to a national referendum.
</P>
<P>
However, Peres admitted that he had not yet received approval
from the ruling Labor Party or notified Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) President Yasser Arafat about his plan.
</P>
<P>
Peres made the remarks to Israeli reporters en route to Oman on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
He said that a referendum is also Israel's policy with Syria,
so Arafat should not see this as being directed solely against
him.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Peres expressed his hope that the move could cause a
delay in the final status talks, which are due to begin next month
and conclude by May 1999. Among the highly charged issues to be
determined is the final status of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
"I will ask the (Labor) Party for a mandate to conduct
negotiations on final status with the Palestinians and to bring
its result to a referendum," said Peres.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that a referendum is the best guarantee that
Israel will not make too many concessions. "When you run such
negotiations, you want results that are acceptable to the majority
of the public. This is the best way there is to ensure majority
support," he said.
</P>
<P>
In reaction to Peres' proposal, the Likud party saw the move as
a calculated attempt to avoid discussion of the issues in the
upcoming Knesset (Israel's parliament) elections and to avoid the
need for the Labor Party to make any clear understandings to the
voters.
</P>
<P>
Likud Chairman Binyamin Netanyahu argued that the talk about
"a future referendum is a ploy to pull the wool over the
electorate's eyes. The real referendum is being held now. The
elections are a referendum," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Peres is afraid of the voters' verdict and is seeking to
confuse the nation, which knows full well that he will cede
the entire Golan (Heights to Syria) and divide Jerusalem," he
added.
</P>
<P>
The left-wing Meretz party was equally critical of the
move.
</P>
<P>
"This move is intended to cynically blur all political lines
and issues and neutralize the campaign of any substantive
discussion and choice," said Meretz leader Yossi Sarid.
</P>
<P>
"If this is the case, then there is nothing left to talk about
now ... Perhaps we should all just wait for Mr. Peres' promised
referendum," he said.
</P>
<P>
The news about Peres' declaration came as no surprise to
Labor, where it was revealed that the possibility of taking
the dealings with the Palestinians out of the election
campaign via a referendum was already discussed months ago,
and is to be officially made the centerpiece of the
upcoming party convention in two weeks.

<HEADLINE> Lin Confident for Atlanta Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, April 2 (Xinhua/OANA) -- Olympic gold medalist and
world women's 200 meters individual medley record-holder Lin Li
Tuesday expressed her confidence for the Atlanta Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
Lin has entered three individual events at the current China's
Champions tourney -- the women's individual medley in 200m and
400m and the 200m breaststroke.
</P>
<P>
She finished the 400m individual medley with a disappointing
time of 4:57.47, ninth place in the heats, but she still gained a
berth in last nights' finals due to withdrawal of a qualifier, Sha
Sha.
</P>
<P>
Lin clocked 4:42.02 in the final and settled for the third
position.
</P>
<P>
"I was quite satisfied with the results," said Lin, who
explained that she had only trained eight weeks after a long-time
lay-off. A regular training session should include 20 weeks.
</P>
<P>
"She performed well," said Lin's coach Zhang Xiong after the
final. "That (4:42.02) has been her best this year."
</P>
<P>
Zhang was very excited after hearing Lin's plan to compete in
the Atlanta Olympics. Lin stayed in Chinese Taipei for five
months, where she taught swimming lessons in a provincial sports
college, and came back to Beijing on January 15 this year.
</P>
<P>
"I had some 40 students there, and with my help, most of them
had improved a lot, I felt happy and meanwhile I felt the hardness
of being a coach," the 26-year-old Lin said.
</P>
<P>
The former world champion also wants to testify one thing,
that is elder athletes just can do as well as the youngsters.
</P>
<P>
"I just want to leave more things to the people," She
said. "I want to set an example for the young swimmers -- I am
still struggling at the age of 26. I think this will be an
encouragement for the youngsters."
</P>
<P>
Asked about the Olympics, Lin said that she had no problem in
taking medals.
</P>
<P>
"I still have the power, I am not sure that must be gold
medals, but I think that at least would be silvers," she replyed
with a shy smile. "Because I am superb in terms of the
international competition experience, and after a long
preparation, I can produce good results."
</P>
<P>
Lin said that she would do better in the 200m individual
medley, slated for Friday, citing that the long-distance events
like 400m individual medley are too much for a swimmer of her age.
</P>
<P>
The world champion will also compete in the 200m breaststroke
event on Thursday.

<HEADLINE> China's International Container Fleet Growing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SUZHOU, April 2 (Xinhua) -- China has seen a rapid growth of
its international container liner transport in the past decade,
Xinhua learned from an ongoing conference here marking the 10th
anniversary of this service in China.
</P>
<P>
China's container transport volume has been growing at an
annual rate of 29 percent since 1986. In 1995 its container
transport volume totalled 5.49 million TEUs.
</P>
<P>
The nation now has 150 international ocean liner firms
operating on 110 routes and offering 1,200 liner services a
month. Its container fleet now has 935 vessels with a combined
capacity of 260,000 TEUs.
</P>
<P>
The national flag carrier, the China Ocean Shipping (Group)
Company (COSCO), has been listed as the world's fourth-largest
container liner fleet for two straight years.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of the 1990s China has endeavored to
improve its container liner services. The punctuality rate of its
liners on major routes has been kept at 100 percent in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
In the past ten years China has built 39 container berths in a
dozen ports, including Shanghai, Qingdao, Dalian, Tianjin and
Shenzhen.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1995 China had 52 container berths with a

<HEADLINE> Mad Cow Crisis Hits Beef Sales in Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Days of media coverage on the
British mad cow disease have slashed beef sales in Turkey's urban
areas, a local newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
Market owners in Ankara have complained that they had seen
beef sales plunge by around 50 percent since the beginning of the
mad cow controversy, the Daily News reported.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted one spokesman for a big retailer in
Ankara as saying "we used to sell around 250 to 300 kilograms of
beef per day. We are now selling 100 kilograms if it is a good
business day for our meat department."
</P>
<P>
He said that he regularly checked rival supermarkets and found
"almost the same results."
</P>
<P>
"This has become a general trend in the market. I believe
small butchers on the corner are suffering as well, " the same
source said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, retail sources said that the beef crisis have
also boosted white meat sales.
</P>
<P>
"I can see that beef sales have mostly shifted
into chicken and fish," said one supermarket manager in Ankara.

<HEADLINE> China Tightens Control of Processing Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, April 2 (Xinhua) -- China has moved to tighten its
control over the processing trade, as a bank guarantee account
system began to operate Monday in 25 major cities, including
Chongqing, Beijing, Shenyang, Shanghai and Haikou.
</P>
<P>
Before that, the system had already been experimented in
Dongguan, Ningbo and Suzhou cities since November last year.
</P>
<P>
Under the new system, businesses in the processing trade will
have to open guarantee accounts at designated banks for any
contracts they have obtained and duly registered at the customs.
</P>
<P>
Upon the finished products being exported within the provided
period, the contracts will be written off by the customs and the
guarantee accounts by the banks.
</P>
<P>
The government hopes that the new system will enable the
customs and banks supervise the processing trade more efficiently
and help crack down on smuggling activities in the business.
</P>
<P>
The processing trade has been booming in China since the early
1980s. Customs statistics show that the nation's processing trade
was worth 132 billion US dollars in 1995, accounting for 47
percent of its total imports and exports. The figures in 1981 were
2.4 billion US dollars and 5.6 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
However, illegal practices have been rampant in the processing
trade. Instead of processing for export, some businesses sell
imported parts and materials on the home market; others sell their
finished products on the home market; and still others are engaged
in smuggling under the cover of engaging in the processing trade.
</P>
<P>
In 1995 the Chinese customs seized 400,000 tons of aluminum
oxide, 500,000 tons of palm oil, 600,000 tons of raw sugar and
250,000 tons of iron ore.
</P>
<P>
Reliable sources here said that the new system will be applied
to the whole country later this year, if experiments in the 25
cities prove successful.

<HEADLINE> Tourists Can Enjoy Trips in Tibet Earlier: Meteorologist </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, April 2 (Xinhua) -- It is the popular view that the best
time to tour Tibet is May and October, but a local meteorologist
said that tourists eager to see Tibet can set out now in April.
</P>
<P>
The highland area is taken as the "third pole of the earth",
and the plateau scenery has been attracting flocks of tourists,
who, however, hold the view that the weather there will not be fit
for touring until May.
</P>
<P>
"In fact, there has long been a misunderstanding about this,"
said Deng Chuanyou, a senior engineer with the Tibet Autonomous
Regional Meteorological Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Deng has been engaged in studying the relations between tourism
and meteorology in Tibet for years.
</P>
<P>
"From the point of view of tourism, we should say that the best
time starts in April," he said.
</P>
<P>
Deng's studies mainly focused on the so-called "golden tourism
route from Nyalam (or Zham port)" bordering Nepal to this capital
of the region, along which there are subtropical jungles and
forests, snow-covered Qomolangma which is the highest peak in the
world, the Zhaxi Lhunbo Temple in Xigaze City with solemn palaces
and golden roofs, the lofty Potala Palace, among other scenic
spots and ethnic attractions.
</P>
<P>
"When people decide to make a tour of Tibet they expect
favorable weather. But tourism and meteorological experts did not
conduct thorough researches about weather conditions along this
route in the past," Deng said.
</P>
<P>
After years of study Deng found out that after a long winter,
warm spring weather starts in April, and the highest temperatures
are in July and August. Winter starts in Tibet in October.
</P>
<P>
Between April and October, the monthly average temperatures are
good for travel. There is a slight wind most of the day, and
precipitation is concentrated in July and August, he said.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the meteorologist noted that most parts of
Tibet are located some 4,000 m above sea level or higher, where it
is cold and the winter months are long, featuring strong
sunlight. Temperatures change moderately around the year but can
change considerably in a single day.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Political and social stability is
critical for the Chinese capital, and without this nothing can be
done, Beijing Mayor Li Qiyan said here today.
</P>
<P>
At the ongoing fourth session of the eighth local legislature,
Li said that maintaining the capital's stability is the persistent
requirement of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
It is also a long-term and demanding political task for local
governments at all levels, he said.
</P>
<P>
"In order to keep such stability," Li continued, "we should
guard against and stand alert for subversion by and internal and
external enemy forces."
</P>
<P>
"Once subversion is uncovered, we should wage a severe struggle
against it," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
"We should also do research on the new circumstances and solve
new problems in public security, take effective steps against all
evil things, and disband all organizations and activities that
endanger social security and order," the mayor said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that various mass groups should be organized to
tighten social security by legal, economic and administrative
means in an effort to create a fine social order and increase the
people's sense of security.
</P>
<P>
Li also demanded that contradictions among the people be
resolved, together with problems that concern their interests, and
that all social factors of instability be removed.
</P>
<P>
In 1995 courts at various levels handled 96,803 criminal,
economic, civil, intellectual property and administrative cases,
of which 95,629 cases were satisfactorily solved.
</P>
<P>
The local public security forces stepped up the fight in the
past year against murder, robbery, rape, hooliganism, explosions,
drug trafficking, pornography, prostitution and illegal
publications.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, April 2 (Xinhua)-- The crisis in Sri Lanka's tea
industry is not only one of unfavorable prices but also of high
cost of production, states a report of the Presidential Commission
on Tea Industry and Trade, just released here.
</P>
<P>
The production cost in Sri Lanka was estimated to be one of the
highest of all tea producing countries of the world, says the
report quoting a World Bank study.
</P>
<P>
The report recommends that unless there is an adequate increase
in productivity and reduction in the cost of production it would
be difficult to overcome the serious crisis the industry is facing
today.
</P>
<P>
It recommends a reduction in costs for the industry to be
competitive and viable.
</P>
<P>
Among other recommendations are increasing yields by
accelerated replanting and improved land management.
</P>
<P>
It suggests increasing labor productivity through efficient
deployment of labor, upward revision of realistic norms and
absorbing surplus labor in diversified activities.
</P>
<P>
The reports adds that the existing system where the government
bears all risks and losses is not satisfactory.
</P>
<P>
It recommends greater participation by the National Institute
of Plantation Management, Tea Research Institute and the Sri Lanka
Tea Board to win the confidence of the tea industry and take
initiatives in tea matters.

<HEADLINE> SBI to Raise 150 Million US Dollars in Euro Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 2 (Xinhua) -- The State Bank of India (SBI)
plans to tap the Euro market either with a five-year 150 million
US dollars Euro-convertible or a global depository receipt issue
in 1996-97.
</P>
<P>
"We need to boost our resources as well as capital adequacy
ratio. The decision has been taken to tap the Euro market," said a
SBI senior official.
</P>
<P>
The capital adequacy ratio of SBI which stood at over 12
percent in March 1995 is likely to come down following the growth
in risk-weighted assets. Moreover, huge provisioning requirement
may eat into its profit in 1995-96, making it a compulsion for it
to enter the market.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of 1995-96, SBI made a provision of 8,000
million rupees ( 231.89 million US dollars) on account of
depreciation on government papers. If the yield to maturity on
five years and above dated government security is fixed at 14
percent, the bank may require further provisioning, the same
official said.

<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, April 2 (Xinhua) -- China's largest sapling center has
gone into operation in the Longnan area in northwest China's Gansu
Province.
</P>
<P>
The project was funded with over 4.7 million Canadian dollars
from the Canadian government, according to Mi Shufen, an official
in charge of the local sapling-planting industry.
</P>
<P>
In the labs of the center 24,000 saplings can be planted in an
hour using vacuum planting machines. And the irrigation,
temperature, sunlight and fertilizer are all computer-controlled.
</P>
<P>
The construction of the center, which covers an area of 40,000
sq m and has a designed annual production capacity of three
million saplings, started in November 1991, Mi said. Canada has
helped China construct similar projects in Beijing and
Heilongjiang Province.
</P>
<P>
It is expected to help solve the afforestation problems in
Gansu, which has sparse rainfall and a late spring.
</P>
<P>
Experiments show that 99.9 percent of the plant's seedlings can
survive, technicians from Lixian County, who bought a batch of
200,000 seedlings, he said.

<HEADLINE> Hainan Establishes New Employment System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Hainan Province in south China, one
of the country's five special economic zones, has introduced labor
import and export service into the labor employment system.
</P>
<P>
The system previously consisted of four parts: employment
introduction, labor training, unemployment insurance and labour
service enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Control on more than 170,000 workers coming from outside of the
island province has been strengthened, and more than 40,000
technicians and managers have been introduced into different
trades in the province, providing a better human resources
environment for its development.
</P>
<P>
The province's overseas labor service agency has helped more
than 300 people from over 20 countries and regions worldwide to
find jobs in Hainan since it was established in 1993, and a larger
number of local people to get employed in various countries.
</P>
<P>
During the Eighth Five-Year Plan period (1991-1995), nearly
250,000 people had been re-employed or changed jobs through the
re-employment training program; the number of labor service
enterprises had risen to 483 from 272; with 520,000 people buying
the unemployment insurance policy, the unemployment insurance had
covered almost all urban and township employees.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 2 (Xinhua) -- This, China's most populous city
has seen a continuous fall in its total population for three
consecutive years, with the birth rate still lower than the death
rate in the city last year.
</P>
<P>
Latest statistics from the municipal statistics department show
that the birth rate was 5.47 percent last year, equivalent to
71,119 people, while the death rate was 7.53, or 97,882 persons.
</P>
<P>
At present, the total population of the city is 13 million.
</P>
<P>
According to an official of the municipal family planning
committee, the drop in the birth rate is mainly due to changes in
people's concepts. With the pressures of living and working
growing nowadays, people do not want to spend much time and effort
on raising children.
</P>
<P>
A sample survey shows that of the 2.7 million married women of
childbearing age, 2.5 million practice birth control, including
those want to delay having babies and those who do not want to
have babies at all. In the meantime, 1.9 million couples have
pledged to have only one child.
</P>
<P>
According to an estimate by the departments concerned, the
total population of the city will rise to a certain extent. It is
estimated that by the year 2000 the city will have a registered
population of 14 million.

BANGKOK, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Ford Motors Co. held a

one-ton pick-up truck project in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
One of the two ventures, at a cost of 30 million dollars, will
produce plastic, electronic and electrical car components in
Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Charoen Pokphand Group, one of Thailand's largest
conglomerates, will take a 30 percent stake in the venture while
the remaining will be held by Ford.

joint venture of Ford and Mando Machinery Corp. -- (40 percent),
to produce climate control parts.
</P>
<P>
The two plants, located in the eastern province of Rayong, 180

<HEADLINE> 16-point Program Proposed to Ease India's Credit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 2 (Xinhua) -- On the eve of general elections
to be started from April 27, the Federation of Indian Chambers of
Commerce and Industry (FICCI), in its suggestions to various
political parties, has evolved a 16-point program for mitigating
the liquidity crunch.
</P>
<P>
The note sent to political parties on Monday contains short-
and long-term solutions for financing the country's economy.
Development of a debt market, infusion of foreign capital and
inflow of working capital from abroad are crucial to ease the
liquidity problem, FICCI sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
The global debt market attracts 350 billion US dollars of which
India's share is insignificant. The national stock exchange is
doing quite well on the equity front, but its performance on the
debt front is not all impressive. Therefore, new debt instruments
such as deep-discount bonds and zero-coupon bonds should be
allowed to be issued by the corporates, FICCI proposed.
</P>
<P>
In its other proposals, FICCI asked the new government to allow
foreign institutional investors and others to invest in government
securities, and allow the foreign companies to bring in working
capital from their countries.

<HEADLINE> Russian Troop Stops Military Operations in Chechnya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Russian artillery and aircraft
stopped combat operations in the rebel Chechen republic today
following President Boris Yeltsin's order to halt "military
operations" there, a top military officer said today.
</P>
<P>
General Vyacheslav Tikhomirov, commander of Russian operations
in Chechnya, said troops had called off a full-scale offensive in
the light of Yeltsin's midnight deadline, said reports from
Grozny, the capital of the breakaway republic.
</P>
<P>
"The military support the president's peace plan to stop
military confrontation in Chechnya so as to put the dispute onto
the track of a peaceful dialog," said the general.
</P>
<P>
Russian troops will gradually pull out from the region as the
situation dictates, but the withdrawal does not signal the end of
"special operations" against "gangsters" and "terrorists," he said.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Yeltsin announced his long-awaited peace plan for
war-torn Chechnya, which included the order to stop combat
operations, a step by step troop withdrawal and free elections
ahead of negotiations on Chechnya's future status within the
Russian federation.
</P>
<P>
He also set up a state commission, headed by Prime Minister
Viktor Chernomyrdin, to coordinate the departments concerned and
to oversee the implementation of the peace plan.
</P>
<P>
The president also said he is ready to conduct indirect talks
with rebel leader Dzhokhar Dudayev, something he had previously
ruled out.
</P>
<P>
The 15-month Chechen crisis, which has cost an estimated 30,000
lives, has become a major obstacle on Yeltsin's road to winning
the presidential election in June.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Puts Off Kiev Visit in Fleet Row </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
decided to postpone his scheduled visit to Ukraine this week
because of the unsolved row on dividing the Black Sea Fleet,
presidential press spokesman Sergei Medvedev announced today.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin was scheduled to make the visit to Kiev on April 4-5
during which he is expected to sign a friendship treaty with
Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
Medvedev said the reason for the postponement was that Russian
and Ukrainian defense officials last week failed to settle a
dispute on dividing the Black Sea Fleet, based in the Crimean port
of Sevastopol.
</P>
<P>
"The president of Russia regards it impossible to sign accords
which do not fully meet Russia's interests," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, Yeltsin hoped that his visit to Ukraine "will become
possible soon" and the talks on dividing the fleet will continue
and achieve success, Medvedev added. He gave no new date of the
rescheduled visit.
</P>
<P>
After Russia announced the delay of Yeltsin's visit, the
Ukrainian Foreign Ministry issued a statement expressing
"understanding" with the decision, while stressing that "the
deployment of Ukraine's naval forces on its territory is a matter
exclusively for Ukraine's jurisdiction as a sovereign state."
</P>
<P>
The ministry said the Ukrainian side has made all efforts
possible to resolve the dispute over the Black Sea Fleet and "it's
appropriate time to hold high-level talks in the near future".
</P>
<P>
Ukraine is willing to receive Yeltsin at any time and hopes
that the two sides will hold further talks on the fleet row, the
statement added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ukraine urged Russia not to link the dispute over
the fleet to the signing of an important friendship pact.
</P>
<P>
Russia and Ukraine have been arguing over how to divide the
Black Sea Fleet and where it should be based ever since the
collapse of the former Soviet Union, a major block in the signing
a friendship pact delayed for four years since Ukraine's
independence.
</P>
<P>
On March 20, Ukrainian Prime Minister Kirillovich Marchuk
visited Moscow to prepare for Yeltsin's trip to Kiev, but failed
to reach an agreement with the Russian side which insisted that
the row over the Black Sea Fleet be linked to the signing a
friendship treaty.
</P>
<P>
Marchuk went to Moscow on March 22 on a working visit and
defense officials from the two sides held consultations aimed at
resolving the dispute, but again failed to bridge the gap.

BANGKOK, April 2 (Xinhua) -- The Nam Thai Party of Thailand
will not stop Foreign Minister Kasem S. Kasemsri from resigning
because he has insisted on quitting, party leader and Deputy Vice
Prime Minister Amnuay Virawan said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time the Nam Thai Party leader has come out
to say that he would no longer try to block Kasem's resignation.
</P>
<P>
Kasem, a veteran diplomat, who now holds the foreign minister's
post under the quota of the Nam Thai Party, has been criticized
since he took office because he had failed to be elected a member
of parliament in the election in July last year and has been
criticized for poor performance in dealing conflicts with
neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
A faction in the party known as Pla Buek reportedly pushed hard
to replace Kasem with an elected MP.
</P>
<P>
Amnuay said if Kasem was to resign, he should submit his
resignation later this month after he travels with Prime Minister
Banharn Silpa-archa to Indonesia and Brunei.
</P>
<P>
Both Amnuay and Prime Minister Banharn have asked Kasem to
stay.

<HEADLINE> Costa Rican Opposition Raps Asylum to Former Ecuadoran VP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, April 1 (Xinhua) -- A Costa Rican congressman from
the opposition party today blasted his government for granting
asylum to a former Ecuadoran vice-president.
</P>
<P>
Rodrigo Gutierrez called Alberto Dahik a "fugitive of justice",
who resigned from his post in Ecuador and fled, by surprise, to
this neighboring Central American country last October.
</P>
<P>
Dahik is not being persecuted politically, Gutierrez noted, and
the granting of his asylum by the Costa Rican Foreign Ministry
last night tainted his legal status as a fugitive.
</P>
<P>
Dahik, who was in charge of the economic adjustment program in
Ecuador, was accused of embezzling 77 million dollars that he
deposited into the accounts of two of his secretaries.
</P>
<P>
But the former vice-president argued that the case was actually
a political persecution against him.
</P>
<P>
Ecuador's legislative assembly voted last year to exonerate
Dahik of his responsibility in the case and President Sixto Duran
asked Jose Maria Figueres, his Costa Rican counterpart, to grant
the asylum.
</P>
<P>
The Costa Rican Foreign Ministry did not give reasons on Monday
why the asylum was granted. However, it said the decision was
made after five months of careful investigations during which
Ecuadoran delegations of supporters and opponents to the asylum
came here to expound their opinions.
</P>
<P>
Gutierrez, the opposition deputy, asserted that the government
acted in a hasty and not very transparent way. He demanded that
Foreign Minister Fernando Naranjo explain to the parliament the
reasons behind the decision.
</P>
<P>
The situation in Ecuador, he added, does not justify granting
political asylum to the country's former vice-president.

MOSCOW, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov
said today that Russia was and still is a big nation and its
comprehensive foreign policies will not to be affected by the
outcome of scheduled June presidential election.
</P>
<P>
He told interviewers from the Interfax news service and the
Krasnaya Zvezda (Red Star) newspaper that the integration of the
Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) has, beyond all
questions, its objective basis and is the key foreign policy issue
between Russia and other CIS countries.
</P>
<P>
Primakov was quoted as saying that the favorable conditions
enjoyed by the CIS members in economy, politics and culture for
integration are unparalleled.
</P>
<P>
But, integration does not mean a restoration of the Soviet
Union, he said. It is an irretrievable fact that the CIS countries
are all sovereign states, he added.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said that the Russian-U.S. relations can
only be developed on an equal footing and on taking into
consideration the interests of both parties.
</P>
<P>
Primakov expressed the hope that the United States would not
pinpoint Russia on a subordinate position in its dealings with
Moscow.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that Russia is opposed to the NATO eastward
expansion and warned that Russia will have to take corresponding
measures should NATO go ahead with its enlargement.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Bangladeshi Faces Another Round of Political Wrangle ( by Tian Fan ) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Since retired Chief Justice Habibur
Rahman was sworn in on March 30 to head a caretaker government,
Bangladeshi major political parties have been engaged in a new
round of political wrangle over the next general elections likely
to be held next month.
</P>
<P>
The former ruling Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and its
biggest rival Awami (people's) League (AL) have in the last two
days separately organized a series of mass rallies and processions
to win more votes.
</P>
<P>
However, it seems that neither the BNP nor the AL could win the
majority in the coming elections, according to some political
analysts.
</P>
<P>
"Generally speaking, the BNP has influence over the low-income
classes and in the countryside while the AL enjoys popularity
among intellectuals and in business communities," said Najib
Chowdhury, a historical professor of Dhaka University.
</P>
<P>
It will be a close contest, just like the 1991 elections.
Nobody knows until the last moment which party will come to power,
said a south Asia diplomat.
</P>
<P>
In the 1991 elections, which were billed as Bangladesh's first
free polls, khaleda Zia's BNP won 146 of the parliament's 300
seats while the AL led by Sheikh Hasina seized 86 seats.
</P>
<P>
"The BNP still enjoys great support and perfect organization on
the grassroots," said Professor Chowdhury, adding that the army,
which has great influence over this country's politics, will be a
decisive force in the coming general elections.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the AL and its allies Jatiya (national) Party (JP)
and Jamaat-e-Islami are likely to lose their cohesion after
claiming victory over the BNP government.
</P>
<P>
"They will go their own way in the next elections as the
difference among the three parties are far greater than their
common ground," an observer here said.

<HEADLINE> Nepali House Panel Criticizes Financial Irregularity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, April 2 (Xinhua) -- A house committee under the
Nepali parliament reacted strongly against most ministries of the
government as they failed to fight internal financial
irregularities in the past year.
</P>
<P>
A meeting of the House Public Accounts Committee Monday
summoned more than 20 secretaries, top civil servants in
ministries, asking them to submit reports on the progress of
anti-irregularity activities in their respective ministries within
two weeks.
</P>
<P>
About 22 billion rupees (some 440 million US dollars) of
government fund has been misused so far by these ministries,
according to the house committee Chairman Hrideyesh Tripathi.
</P>
<P>
He revealed that the ministries of defense, transport and water
resources had the worst records in effectively controlling
financial irregularities.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the three ministries accounted for
one-third of the total irregularities recorded by the Office of
Auditor General.
</P>
<P>
The house panel also asked clarification from these senior
officials of the reasons why they could not take appropriate legal
action against those who misused the nation's property.
</P>
<P>
The committee warned the secretaries that it would ask the
Council of Ministers to take strong steps against some of them if
they refuse to tackle corruption in their ministries.

<HEADLINE> Poland to Boost Small, Medium-Sized Enterprises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Poland will create conditions to
develop small and medium-sized enterprises to fight unemployment,
Minister of Industry and Trade Klemens Scierski has said.
</P>
<P>
"The future belongs to small and medium-sized enterprises,"
which can adapt swiftly to changes in the market and are
instrumental in job creation, Scierski was quoted in today's local
press as saying.
</P>
<P>
There are just over two million small and medium-sized
enterprises in the country, accounting for 90 percent of the total
number of companies, and 60 percent of jobs.
</P>
<P>
The Polish government has adopted a policy to promote the
development of such businesses through financial aid.
</P>
<P>
The State Economic Bank, which has obtained 25 million zloty
(about 10 million U.S. dollars) from the national budget to
strengthen its loan-making capacity, has set up a guarantee
fund to grant loans to small and medium-sized enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The early 1990s witnessed a boom in small and medium-sized
enterprises, which later stalled due to lack of funds.

<HEADLINE> Balkan Nations Meet to Talk Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, April 1 (Xinhua) -- A two-day meeting on regional
security and military cooperation among Balkan nations closed here
today after talks on the NATO Partnership for Peace program,
peacekeeping missions and joint military exercises.
</P>
<P>
Regional cooperation was highlighted at the meeting with a
shared view to ensure security and development in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
Albanian Defense Minister Safet Zhulali said the meeting was a
joint effort to "pour water" over the fuse of what has been
referred to in history as Europe's powder-keg.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, proposed by Albania, drew defense ministers from
Bulgaria, Macedonia, Turkey, Italy and Albania and U.S. Defense
Secretary William Perry. But the Greek defense minister failed to
show up.
</P>
<P>
He also linked Balkans' development to regional cooperation,
adding "There will be no peace if there is no security; and there
will be no development if there is no peace."
</P>
<P>
Echoing Handziski's remarks, Bulgarian defense minister Dimitr
Pavlov said his country's efforts to fight against terrorism, drug
smuggling and illegal arms traffic cannot go well without other
neighbor's cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He said cooperation with neighbors is a major principle in
Bulgaria's foreign policy and detailed plans in this regard have
been made out.
</P>
<P>
In his address to the meeting, Perry suggested regional defense
cooperation and establishment of mutual trust among the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
Macedonian Defense Minister Blago Handziski also said an influx
of refugees to the Balkans posed a threat to stability in his
country and the entire region.
</P>
<P>
Macedonia is now sheltering some 12,000 refugees who fled war
in former Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> Colombia: Government, Guerrilla Group Call Off Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTA FE DE BOGOTA, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Peace talks between the
Colombian government and a guerrilla group have been called off
since the death of a rebel leader Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Colombian authorities said today there is tension following
the death of Alfonso Grajales Lemos in the buffer zone set up for
facilitating the negotiations in southwestern Colombia.
</P>
<P>
Grajales Lemos, known as "Commander Alonso," of the "Jaime
Bateman Cayon" group, died in confusing circumstances -- the army
says he was killed in a confrontation but the guerrilla says he
lost his life in a highway accident.
</P>
<P>
The government and the "Jaime Bateman Cayon" group
decided to temporarily suspend their talks that began in early
March.
</P>
<P>
However, Nury Fernandez, interior minister for the department
of Cauca and coordinator of the facilitating peace committee, said
he is confident that dialogue will continue with the second in
command of the guerrilla group who is known as "Rommel".
</P>
<P>
The "Jaime Bateman Cayon" group is a dissident group of the
M-19 movement that was formed in 1970.
</P>
<P>
In 1989, the government and the M-10 movement reached an
agreement to demilitarize the guerrilla organization allowing it
to take part in national politics as a political party.
</P>
<P>
In 1993, some former M-19 members reorganized into the group,
and began their armed battle in the department of Cauca.
</P>
<P>
In February this year, spokespersons for the government and the
group agreed to hold their first round of peace talks between
March and May.

<HEADLINE> Australian Domestic Demand Still Strong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Australian consumer demand
remained strong in February despite the fact that local economy
showed signs of a soft landing.
</P>
<P>
Retail trade rose 0.2 percent in February to 10.18 billion
Australian dollars (7.94 billion US dollars) seasonally adjusted
over the previous month, the Australian Bureau of Statistics
announced here today.
</P>
<P>
Retail trade totaled 10.16 billion Australian dollars (7.92
billion US dollars in January.
</P>
<P>
The fifth consecutive monthly growth of retail sales surprised
local economists, who expected the figure to remain static or fall
in February.
</P>
<P>
Today's figure is 8.4 percent higher than the 9.39 billion
Australian dollars (7.32 billion US dollars) recorded one year
ago.
</P>
<P>
Local economists predicted that the economy would slow down to
an annual growth rate of 2-3 percent in this fiscal year. However,
strong domestic demand shows that consumers are still confident in
the economy.
</P>
<P>
Retail sales growth in February mainly came from strong surges
in sales of department stores and other retail sectors.

<HEADLINE> Brazilian Ranchers Feel UK Ban on Beef Unjustified </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian cattle ranchers
said today they feel that Britain's decision to ban the imports of
cattle and beef products from animals over 30 months or older is
unjustified.
</P>
<P>
The measure announced Friday by Britain is "unjustified", said
Ferdinando Carolo, president of the Brazilian association of meat
exporters.
</P>
<P>
Brazilian cattle ranchers said that Britain's ban will hurt
them since their exports to Britain involve cattle older than 30
months, which are worth 9 million U.S. dollars a month.
</P>
<P>
Cooked and canned exports of beef to the British market
represent the biggest proportion amounting to 7 million dollars a
month.
</P>
<P>
Britain made the decision to ban the imports of cattle and
products from animals over the age of 30 months after many
countries in the world banned imports of British beef and beef
products because of the mad cow disease.

BANGKOK, April 2 (Xinhua) -- The Export-Import Bank of Thailand

The bank on Monday opened a new office at the Export Promotion
Department of the Commerce Ministry to facilitate procedures for
those exporters who want to apply for its credit.

HAVANA, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Cuban authorities set a sugar
production target of 4.5 million tons for 1996 and announced that
3 million tons had been reached last month.

Cuban President Fidel Castro asked the sugar producers to do
their "very utmost" to reach that target, as a response to the
recent tightening of the U.S. economic blockade.

The United States has enacted the Helms-Burton Bill to tighten

<HEADLINE> Thailand's Consumer Price Index Up 0.3 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's Consumer Price Index
(CPI) in March rose 0.3 percent from February and 7.3 percent on a
year-on-year basis.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics from the Thai Commerce Ministry, the
food goods index, which account for nearly 40 percent of the CPI,
climbed up 0.3 percent from February, while the non-food index
edged up 0.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The rise of food prices was attributed to higher production
costs of sweetened milk, fresh milk and cooking oil. The looming
effects of last year's floods also caused higher prices for limes
and vegetables.
</P>
<P>
The index for eggs and dairy products showed the highest
increase for March, at 3.4 percent, while prices for meat, duck,
chicken and fish declined by 0.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers said that the increase rate of the CPI had
slowed during the first quarter this year, at 0.7 percent, 0.5
percent, 0.3 percent from January to March respectively, and it
was a good sign that inflation was cooling down.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Urged to Pay Dues to United Nations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Failure by the United
States to pay its multi-billion-dollar debt to the United Nations
would be a "moral and financial default", a major U.S. newspaper
said today.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. is facing a financial crisis with debts to the tune of
2.9 billion U.S. dollars, and the United States owing the lion's
share of 1.6 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
"If Washington fails to come up with money solemnly promised by
three successive presidents, not only downsizing but capsizing the
U.N., it would be a moral and financial default by the
organization's principal founder," said the New York Times in an
editorial.
</P>
<P>
The paper urged the Clinton administration to compromise with
Congress over the issue. Congress has agreed to a foreign
affairs budget providing 823 million dollars instead of the
requested 934 million dollars for U.N. dues, and the full 445
million dollars for peace-keeping.
</P>
<P>
But in return, Congress is insisting on merging any one of
three currently independent federal agencies - arms control,
information and foreign aid - into the State Department.
</P>
<P>
"America's debt, which represents a default on a treaty
obligation, is an unexcusable embarrassment," said the New York
Times.

WASHINGTON, April 1 (Xinhua) -- American baseball Umpire John
McSherry collapsed on the field seven pitches into Cincinnati's
National League opener in Cincinnati on Monday and died at a
hospital about an hour later.
</P>
<P>
The devastated Reds and Montreal Expos postponed the game about
an hour after McSherry collapsed. The game will be replayed in
its entirety Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
University Hospital said McSherry died of "sudden cardiac
death," a condition in which the heart beats out of control.
</P>
<P>
McSherry, 51, was listed at 148 kilograms and had a history of
medical problems. He had told the other umpires that he was going
to be treated Tuesday for arrhythmia, or abnormal heart beat.
</P>
<P>
He was declared dead about an hour later at University Hospital.
A spokeswoman said McSherry's heart had stopped beating properly.
</P>
<P>
Last August, McSherry was forced to leave a game between
Atlanta and Chicago because of heat exhaustion. In 1993, he left a
game in Cincinnati against Los Angeles after becoming ill in the
heat.

<HEADLINE> Ningxia Export Base for Moslem Food </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, April 2 (Xinhua) -- The Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region
has become an export base for Moslem food, including fruit of the
Chinese wolfberry, edible ferns, milk powder and dehydrated citric
acid.
</P>
<P>
At present, there are more than 260 food enterprises in this,
China's only Moslem region, 20 percent of which produce moslem
food, according to an official of the regional food association.
The food has been exported to more than 30 countries and regions,
earning over 17 million US dollars in foreign currency.
</P>
<P>
The climate in Ningxia is suitable for the growth of edible
ferns and Chinese wolfberries. In recent years production bases of
the fruit of the Chinese wolfberry, edible ferns, hops, asparagus
and almonds have been set up in the region. Zhongning County,
named "Hometown of the Fruit of the Chinese Wolfberry" by the
State Council, now has an annual production of 300,000 kg.
</P>
<P>
Over the past decade the regional authorities have set aside
over 15 million yuan as a special fund for the development of the
food industry. At the same time, more than 100 million yuan-worth
of overseas funds as well as 12 varieties of advanced equipment
have been introduced to the region.
</P>
<P>
The imported equipment and techniques have rapidly improved the
quality of the foodstuffs. Over 97 percent of the citric acid
produced by the Ningxia Fermentation Factory, which uses imported
equipment, is exported to over 20 countries and regions, including
Germany, Britain, the United States, Belgium and Singapore.

<HEADLINE> Tianjin Unemployed Offer Domestic Services </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Zhang Li, a woman dismissed by a
shirt factory in this northern coastal city, has finally chosen to
work as a housemaid for a university professor, as this could add
400-yuan (about 48 US dollars) in monthly income to her family.
</P>
<P>
"At the very beginning I thought doing housework for others was
a degrading job. But now it is all right. I am familiar with
housekeeping and do not feel tired. And the payment is not bad,"
Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
So far, dozens of women workers who have been laid off by their
factories have started to be reemployed as housemaids in the city.
</P>
<P>
In the past, many local people complained there were not enough
jobs, but felt reluctant to offer domestic services, which was
widely regarded as degrading.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that a total of 6,000 local people who have
lost their jobs have started to offer services to others, which is
deemed one of the most important and suitable businesses for the
unemployed.
</P>
<P>
The unemployed women usually do housekeeping, cleaning and
cooking while the men help move things, deliver vegetables and
coal, and change gas cylinders, which need more strength.
</P>
<P>
Ma Jianbing, a former shop assistant, now rides his bicycle to
deliver vegetables in the southwest part of the city in sunshine
and in rain.
</P>
<P>
"Although the work is very tiring, I can earn as much as 500
yuan each month, more than what I earned before," Ma said with a
smile.
</P>
<P>
Experts said the domestic service market has good prospects, as
more and more couples have to work and have no time to take care
of their families. Thus the unemployed now can make a living doing
jobs which used to be done by transients, who earned two billion
yuan annually from the city.
</P>
<P>
A manager of a major local domestic service company said each
day his company receives dozens of unemployed job-seekers, most of
whom are locals.
</P>
<P>
This has not only provided broad prospects for local
reemployment, but also helped those who have difficulties getting
domestic services.

BUENOS AIRES, April 1 (Xinhua) -- The armed forces of Argentina
today commemorated War Veterans Day and the 14th anniversary of
the war of the Malvinas (Falkland) Islands, which broke out in
1982 and which they lost to Britain.
</P>
<P>
"We went without being prepared for an insular war, but far
beyond any political consideration of the conflict is the fact of
Argentine resistance," army chief Lieut. Gen. Martin Balza said at
a ceremony held in the army headquarters.
</P>
<P>
Balza praised the heroism of the Argentine soldiers who fought
in the war for the Malvinas Islands, known by Britons as the
Falkland Islands.
</P>
<P>
He decorated the veterans who had outstanding performances
during the war over the islands.
</P>
<P>
Joint Chief of Staff Lieut. Gen. Mario Candido Diaz and former
governor of the Malvinas Islands Gen. Mario Benjamin Menendez as
well as navy and air forces representatives attended the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Guido di Tella has sent 16,000 letters to
veterans and relatives of the victims of the war, praising those
who dedicated their lives to the war for Argentina's sovereignty
over those islands.
</P>
<P>
The major ceremonies will be held on Tuesday, the day on which
the war with Britain began in 1982, to commemorate the 14th
anniversary of the war in which Argentina tried to recover its
sovereignty over the islands.

<HEADLINE> Feature: More Colorful Life for People in Yan'an </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Yan'an, considered the sacred place
of the Chinese revolution, is no longer the drab, poverty-stricken
place it once was,
</P>
<P>
Clothes are no longer something to keep one warm. Trim suits,
sturdy jeans, shiny shoes and colorful neckties give a strong
signal to visitors: the world-renowned small city, just like any
other place in China, is now moving very rapidly toward
modernization.
</P>
<P>
For a long time the image of Yan'an was dominated by white head
towels and black cotton-padded jackets, but today it is not a easy
thing for a tourist to find them in the streets of Yan'an.
</P>
<P>
In the daytime the city is a sea of colors. While white clouds
float in the blue sky, tall buildings, buses, advertising balloons
and shops are a riot of color.
</P>
<P>
When evening comes Yan'an people like to climb up to the top of
Mount Baota, which is a symbol of the city, or go to another
mountain top which is about the same height, to look down at the
myriad, dream-like twinkling lights of the city far below, as well
as to enjoy the fragrant spring breeze.
</P>
<P>
Even those who have come to Yan'an many times will be
astonished by the huge change in this famous city. Except for
those used as memorials, the traditional cave dwellings have been
rebuilt and decorated with modern materials and rich colors,
competing with modern highrises in grace and style.
</P>
<P>
During the winter many residents move their flowers into the
cave dwellings, and when spring comes the flowers, accompanied by
beautiful folk paper-cuts, attract many tourists.
</P>
<P>
Silent changes can also be detected on the dinner table.
Millet, pumpkin and pickled Chinese cabbage used to be the staple
diet for Yan'an people in the winter. But now even during the
coldest days plenty of fresh cucumbers and tomatoes as well as
other vegetables can be seen in the local markets.
</P>
<P>
Small earthen paths trodden by the revolutionaries 60 years ago
have been replaced by disco halls and bars. Music and colorful
neon lamps are the new image of the sacred revolutionary place.
</P>
<P>
Walking on the streets of Yan'an and enjoying the beautiful
scenery, people can hardly remember the days when night markets
were looked down upon and even banned.
</P>
<P>
Changes in colors have a meaning more than color itself. It is
based on the improvement of people's living conditions and living
philosophy. According to local statistics, the income of Yan'an
people, both in urban and rural areas, is 15 times greater than in
1978. Getting richer, people begin to seek more beauty in life.
</P>
<P>
While Yan'an is changing, still something remains unchanged.
This is the people's kindness, which hides deep behind the high
buildings and in the people's hearts. The same sort of kindness

<HEADLINE> Giant Commercial Group in Yangtze River Valley </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NINGBO, April 2 (Xinhua) -- The Changjiang United Economic
Development Group recently announced that it will set up about 20
large department stores and other trade entities in the Yangtze
River valley in the next two years.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2000 the group will have expanded its business to
more than 30 cities in the valley.
</P>
<P>
The group was launched in September 1992 by the governments of
Chongqing, Wuhan, Nanjing and Shanghai, all big cities on the
Yangtze, and the Bank of Communications, China's largest
shareholding commercial bank.
</P>
<P>
Group officials said they will set up a commercial and trading
corridor along the valley.
</P>
<P>
The group's first two retail businesses -- the Ningbo Changfa
Plaza and the Suzhou Changfa Plaza -- have been very successful,
the officials said, adding that another two plazas in Shanghai and
Nanjing, respectively, are currently being built.
</P>
<P>
So far, the group has established three regional firms and 54
subfirms in the valley cities, with its total property estimated
at 2.2 billion yuan-worth, the officials claimed.

<P>
FUZHOU, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Fujian Province in east China has
been implementing a massive upgrading of its highway networks
since 1993.
</P>
<P>
In the last three years the province has upgraded more than
3,200 km of substandard highways under the so called "pioneer
program", a figure 7.8 times higher than the total for the
previous 43 years.
</P>
<P>
Projects under the five-year program include an expressway
linking this provincial capital with Xiamen, a major port city,
and Zhangzhou and Zhao'an cities; the upgrading of five national
and provincial highways totalling 4,000 km; and building 4,000 km
of quality roads.
</P>
<P>
Realizing the importance of roads to its economy, the
provincial government has given priority to the program, a fact
that explains the upgrading of the 485-km national highway 324
into a six-lane expressway in less than eight months.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Warn Against Pest Invasion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Australia would become vulnerable
to invasion of various new pests and diseases if the country
continued to let its quarantine standards to run down, local
scientists warned.
</P>
<P>
In a report to the Australian Quarantine Review Committee under
the Federal Government, scientists of the Australian Academy of
Science (AAS) said that in recent years, 19 alien insect pests,
seven livestock diseases and a great number of weeds had slipped
into the country.
</P>
<P>
This demonstrated that Australia was unprecedentedly exposed to
invasion of serious pests, weeds and diseases, the scientists
said.
</P>
<P>
Australia has one of the strictest quarantine rules in the
world. But scientists said that global warming would make the
country a favorable place for many pests, including human and
animal disease vectors. Expansion of trade and increase of
international travel also made spread of pests and disease faster,
easier and more unpredictable than ever before.
</P>
<P>
The silverleaf whitefly is believed to come into Australia with
flowers imported from the United States. The whitefly has caused
the loss of 9,000 farm jobs in California in the US alone.
</P>
<P>
An accidental release of a rabbit virus imported from the
Northern Hemisphere has destroyed large number of rabbits
throughout Australia.
</P>
<P>
Australia is known for its unique native plants and animals.
Its bio-system is much less complex than in other continents and
more vulnerable to alien pests.
</P>
<P>
"In future, we need to pay greater attention to the protection
of Australia's native plants and animals, to the long-term future
of our agriculture and the protection of Australians from new
diseases," AAS president Gustav Nossal said.
</P>
<P>
The scientists called for the government to lift quarantine
standards, crack down on imported flowers, tighten controls over
bulk grain imports, intensify surveillance at ports and airports
and be more conservative in granting import licenses for living
organisms, especially plants and fish.
</P>
<P>
They were concerned that Australia was lowering its capacity to
exclude the entry of exotic human diseases and downgrading its
quarantine standards under pressure of world trade liberalization.
</P>
<P>
They said that a national mechanism should be established to
coordinate monitoring and control of pests and diseases all over
the country.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 2, (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Women's College, the
first one of its kind based in the capital, is making efforts to
be an information and training center for the Asia-Pacific region
as well as women in China, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
The College, under the auspices of the All-China Women's
Federation and its branches, has been a core of a women's
education network based on 28 schools for women leaders.
</P>
<P>
The college will be a modern school with its own character for

years, has eight departments, including social work, which trains
social workers and officials focusing on the development of the
economy and women's studies.
</P>
<P>
Some 70 percent of the teachers have obtained at least master's
degrees. The college currently has 3,000 students with women as
the majority of them.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Serb-Croat Exchange of POWs in Bosnia Fails </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, April 1 (Xinhua) -- The exchange of prisoners of war
(POWs) between Bosnian Serb and Croat parties, planned to take place
in central Bosnia today, has failed due to some misunderstanding
between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Both sides had brought prisoners to the line of separation and
assured representatives of the International Committee of the Red
Cross (ICRC) that an exchange would take place, but both took the pows
back after disagreement on who should be included in the pow list,
according to Tanjug news agency.
</P>
<P>
It said representatives of Exchange Commissions of the Bosnian Serb
Army had agreed with President of the Croatian State Commission for
Exchange, Col. Ivan Grujic, that only members of the Bosnian Serb Army
and the Croatian Defense Council (HVO) be exchanged with exclusion of
those in the regular Croatian Army at the moment.
</P>
<P>
This agreement, however, was rejected by President of the State
Commission for Exchange of the Bosnian Croat republic of Herzeg-Bosna
Berislav Pusic. Pusic even demanded that the present representatives
of the NATO-led peace Implementation Force (IFOR) seize the Croat POWs
by force.
</P>
<P>
After IFOR representatives rejected the idea, Pusic ordered that
Serb prisoners be taken back in the direction of the town of Kupres,
Tanjug said.
</P>
<P>
As a sign of good will, the Serb representatives released
four HVO soldiers, leaving only regular Croatian army troops in
captivity, it said.
</P>
<P>
Republika Srpska Prime Minister Rajko Kasagic announced late last
week that Bosnian Serbs would release all POWs by the end of last
month.
</P>
<P>
At an enlarged meeting of the Contact Group for Bosnia held in
Moscow nine days ago, it was agreed that all three sides in Bosnia had
to release all POWs by the end of March, or face the cancellation of
an international donors' conference for Bosnia's reconstruction.

<HEADLINE> Mutant Gene Linked to Heart Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Australian scientists discovered
a gene whose mutant form is linked with much higher-than-average
risks of diabetes and heart diseases.
</P>
<P>
The gene, known as Lipoprotein Lipase (LpL), can mutate and
produce inadequate enzyme to break down fat in human body,
scientists at the Prince Henry Hospital in Sydney said.
</P>
<P>
David Wilcken, Michael McCredie and Wang Xingli at the
hospital's cardiovascular genetics laboratory found that people
who have the mutant gene are three times more likely to have
diabetes and twice more likely to have heart disease than those
who don't.
</P>
<P>
"This Lipoprotein Lipase gene variant is associated with the
occurrence and with the severity of the disease from the number of
diseased coronary arteries and the extent of the obstructions in
them," Wilcken told local press.
</P>
<P>
The researching team at the hospital studied LpL gene type in
475 people aged 65 or younger.
</P>
<P>
The LpL gene is responsible for converting fat into energy. But
a mutant gene cannot work properly, thus allowing fat to
accumulate in and clog blood vessels in the heart.
</P>
<P>
The discovery helped to solve one of the mysteries of how
people develop heart disease.
</P>
<P>
Wilcken said that further study into the discovery would lead
to precautionary measures against potential heart disease. People
who are found to have the mutant gene could change their
lifestyle, such as diet and exercise, to reduce the risk of heart
disease.
</P>
<P>
The genetic discovery further confirmed that heart disease and
diabetes can be passed from one generation to another.
</P>
<P>
Other genes that have been proved to link with heart disease
are mutant forms of the ACE gene and the ApoE gene.

<HEADLINE> UN Announces Plan of Staff Cuts, Efficiency Measures </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 1 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations today
announced a detailed plan of staff cuts of 10 percent and
efficiency measures for 1996 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
A new report, by the name of Proposed Program Budget for the
Biennium 1996-1997, said that in order to achieve a zero-growth
budget approved by the General Assembly, the U.N. has to abolish
200 posts and create 800 vacancies.
</P>
<P>
Joseph Connor, undersecretary-general for administration and
management, told the press that the abolition of 200 posts and
creation of 800 vacancies are expected to be realized through
buy-outs, attrition and outright firings
</P>
<P>
It is said about 150 employees took early retirement last year
and another 150 will leave in coming months through normal
attrition. Another 100 or so will be moved to new jobs and a
buy-out program is expected to cover another 200-300 people. The
plan could result in firings of 300 to 500 people.
</P>
<P>
With regards efficiency measures, the report said the U.N. has
to cut publications, meetings and analytical work. The Information
Department said that there would be a "decline in the speed and
quality of press coverage."
</P>
<P>
The General Assembly last December adopted a two-year budget of
2.6 billion U.S. dollars that was 200 million U.S. dollars less
than the secretary-general had requested. The assembly also asked
for another 154 million U.S. dollars to be sliced for cost
reductions. These force the U.N. Secretariat to increase efficiency
and cut staff.

<HEADLINE> Britain Proposes to Kill 4 Million Cattle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Britain today proposed to destroy
up to 4.6 million cattle over the next six years in an attempt to
end the crisis over "mad cow" disease.
</P>
<P>
At an emergency meeting of European Union farm ministers in
Luxembourg, Douglas Hogg, British minister of agriculture, called
on the EU to pay at least 80 percent of the cost, which could
amount to more than 500 million pounds (667 million U.S. dollars)
a year, according to reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
He also pleaded for the EU-wide ban on British beef to be
raised, saying that it was "in everybody's interest that the ban
is lifted as soon as possible."
</P>
<P>
But the move failed to persuade ministers of other EU countries
to agree to an early lifting of the ban on British beef exports
worth more than 600 million pounds (800 million dollars) a year,
the reports said.
</P>
<P>
They made it cleat at the meeting that Britain's measures to
restore public confidence in the beef market should be in place
first before any raising of the ban could be considered.
</P>
<P>
French Farm Minister Phillippe Vasseur was quoted as saying,
"We will only lift the embargo when we have total agreement that
we have no risk."
</P>
<P>
European Commission officials also said that the ministers all
demanded "further radical measures" to restore public confidence.
</P>
<P>
Downing Street said tonight that Britain would not be rushed
into a decision on slaughtering cattle without European action to
lift the ban.

<HEADLINE> US Urges Chechens to Respect Cease-fire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 1 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. government today
urged Chechen forces to respect a cease-fire declared by Russian
President Boris Yeltsin for the war-torn region Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"We welcome President Yeltsin's decision... to begin
withdrawing army units and intensify the search for a settlement,"
U.S. President's National Security Adviser Anthony Lake said in a
speech to the U.S.-Russia Business Council.
</P>
<P>
"We call on the Chechens to respond in a similar spirit," he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
Lake made the appeal amid reports of fresh attacks on Russian
troops by Chechen forces.
</P>
<P>
Lake said that he had just received a report of a new Chechen
attack that had caused heavy losses on a Russian army column.
</P>
<P>
"We hope very much this is the last shot in the last phase,
rather than the opening shot in a new round of fighting," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a U.S. State Department spokesman today said that
Yeltsin's willingness to declare a unilateral cease-fire
demonstrated his serious intent to make peace.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also urged the Chechen forces to immediately
stop fighting.

<HEADLINE> US Official Calls for Continued Reforms in Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 1 (Xinhua) -- A senior U.S. Treasury
official today called on Russia to continue a policy of overall
economic reforms, saying that is the only way to seek a long-term
development and stability of the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the U.S.-Russia Business Council on Russian trade
and investment, U.S. Assistant Treasury Secretary for
International Affairs David Lipton said that Russia could achieve
a "real market economy" in three years if it sticks to policies
required by the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
Last Thursday, the IMF approved a new three-year 10.2 billion
U.S. dollar loan conditioned on policies for price stability and
solid ruble exchange rate, tax reform, bank supervision and
agriculture reform.
</P>
<P>
That was the fourth large loan by the IMF to Russia since 1993.
In 1993 and 1994, Russia received a 3 billion U.S. dollar loan
and in 1995, it got a loan of 6 billion U.S. dollars on condition
that Moscow should meet the requirements by the IMF for economic
reforms.
</P>
<P>
Lipton said that the next phase "could see Russia turn a corner
to a growing, market-based economy with rising living standards."
</P>
<P>
Noting the upcoming presidential elections in Russia, Lipton
alleged that it would be a tragic if Russia retreated from reform.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that market economy has brought tangible economic
benefits to Russians with workers' wages rising, business sectors
turning around on export growth and consumers spending more.

<HEADLINE> Saudi Ambassador Warns Britain Over Dissident </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabian Ambassador to Britain
Ghazi Algosaibi said tonight that his country would cancel arms
contracts with Britain unless it expelled a Saudi dissident.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the BBC TV, the ambassador said that
Britain would lose millions of pounds in arms contracts unless
Mohammed Masari, leader of the London-based Committee for the
Defense of Legitimate Rights, was deported.
</P>
<P>
"If you are so insistent that I am going to tell you that the
continued presence (of Mr Masari) here will harm British relations
and trade relations, I'm going to tell you that, yes," he said.
</P>
<P>
Masari, who has campaigned against the Saudi royal family, was
ordered in January to leave Britain for the Caribbean island of
Dominica, but last month he won a first appeal against his
deportation after an independent appeals judge said that his life
could be in danger in Dominica.
</P>
<P>
British government officials admitted in January that they made
the order to protect lucrative British military sales to Saudi
Arabia.

<HEADLINE> Milosevic Meets With UN Official for Eastern Slavonia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Serbian President Slobodan
Milosevic held talks here today with U.N. Administrator for the
Eastern Slavonia region Jacques Klein.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, both sides urged the full implementation of the
Serb-Croat agreement on the region which was signed in November
last year, a statement issued by the Serbian presidential office
said.
</P>
<P>
Milosevic and Klein said utmost attention had to be paid to the
questions of normalization and improvement of conditions in
Eastern Slavonia, which would undoubtedly help relax tensions and
build up mutual confidence.
</P>
<P>
Eastern Slavonia has been placed under one-year administration
of the United Nations, with the possible extension of the U.N.
mandate for one more year according to the U.N. Security Council
resolution of January 15 this year.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Klein told reporters that they were both
optimistic regarding the developments in that region.
</P>
<P>
Klein said the objective of the U.N. peace efforts was to
protect the lives of the population, their dignity and property.
He said all interested parties, including the Yugoslav and
Croatian governments, were resolved fully to support the process
of finding a preaceful settlement for the situation in the region.
</P>
<P>
Klein, a retired U.S. army general, urged the population not to
leave the area. He said they had nothing to fear as the U.N.
administration had 5,000 troops, tanks, helicopters -- a veritable
armed force which was under its control.
</P>
<P>
"Before we leave, we shall set up a local government with an
adequate representation of the local population," he added.

<P>
BELGRADE, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Bosnian Serb leader Radovan
Karadzic said today the Bosnian Serbs would consistently work on
the implementation of the Dayton agreement, on the strengthening
of peace and on the preservation of the Serb independence.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a session of the Serb parliament in Pale, the Serb
stronghold, Karadzic said the redrawing of the Dayton accord at
the expense of the Serb people would not be allowed.
</P>
<P>
Karadzic said that the priorities of Serb state Republika
Srpska in the coming period were to care for the refugees and to
distribute the abandoned property between them, to help in the
sowing and the economic revival, and to prevent the plunder of
state property, especially forests.
</P>
<P>
After his speech, the Serb leader presented decorations to the
best Serb Army units, officers and individuals whose courage
proved their allegiance to the serb people and their state in
Bosnia, and Serb Army chief commander General Ratko Mladic was the
first officer to be decorated.
</P>
<P>
The Serb parliament discussed later in the day the coordination
of the Serb state constitution with that of Bosnia-Herzegovina, as
stipulated by the Dayton agreement.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Official on UN Peacekeeping Operations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 1 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese diplomat
said today that despite the profound changes in the international
scene over the past decades, some basic principles governing
peacekeeping operations remain unchanged and still have great
vitality.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Wang Xuexian, China's deputy permanent
representative to the United Nations, said in a U.N. committee on
peacekeeping operations that to ensure a healthy development of
the U.N. peacekeeping operations, the world community has to
follow some basic principles.
</P>
<P>
According to Ambassador Wang, these guidelines are:
</P>
<P>
-- To observe the purposes and principles of the U.N. Charter,
in particular the principle of respect for state sovereignty and
non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries;
</P>
<P>
-- To settle disputes through peaceful means such as good
offices, mediation and negotiation instead of resorting to
frequent mandatory actions. Even humanitarian operations should
not resort to military means;
</P>
<P>
-- To oppose double standards and imposition of the policies
and views of one or a few countries on the U.N. Security Council.
It should not be allowed that some countries carry out military
intervention in the name of the United Nations;
</P>
<P>
-- For peacekeeping operations, to abide by the principles that
have proved effective such as obtaining prior consent from the
parties concerned, observing strict neutrality and non-use of
force except for self-defense; and
</P>
<P>
-- To adopt a realistic approach and confine the operation
within one's capability. Launch peacekeeping operations only when
conditions are ripe and refrain, in whatever circumstances, from
becoming a party to a conflict in deviation of the fundamental
orientation of peacekeeping operations.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Special Committee on Peacekeeping Operation began it
1996 session today. The committee elected Ibrahim A. Gambari of
Nigeria as chairman and decided to hold a maximum of six sessions
of general debate between Monday and Wednesday.

LAGOS, April 3 (Xinhua) -- Director of United Nations
Information Centre Mrs. Janet Badjan-Young called here today for
an urgent re-distribution of global resources to make the UN
declaration of 1997 as a year for poverty eradication
meaningful.
</P>
<P>
Speakng at the "lions day with the UN", Mrs Badjan-Young said
that the co-existence of the rich and the abjectly poor did not
promote social harmony and understanding.
</P>
<P>
The lions day is set aside for members worldwide to support
and propagate information about the UN, its humanitarian
objectives and the work of its agencies.
</P>
<P>
The UN director said that for social harmony, peace and
understanding to thrive, there must be a basic minimum of social
goods accessible to those in need.
</P>
<P>
The director urged members of the lions clubs to remember that
there were millions without food to eat or clothes to wear as
well as "the jobless, the homeless, hopeless and the helpless".
</P>
<P>
She also appealed to the club and other non-governmental
organisations to play a decisive role to remove poverty. enditem

<TEXT>
<P>
Dublin, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Irish President Mary Robinson and
visiting Chinese parliament Vice-Chairman Tian Jiyun promised to
strengthen bilateral cooperation in all fields.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting with Tian, vice-chairman of the Standing Committee
of the Chinese National People's Congress, earlier today,
President Robinson said the current visit is a success and will
certainly enhance mutual understanding between the two peoples.
</P>
<P>
On bilateral economic and trade relations, Robinson attached
great significance to developing strengthened economic and trade
cooperation with China owing to its importance in the world stage.
</P>
<P>
She also expressed her conviction of promoting cultural
contacts between the two countries, saying there were great
potentials to be developed in this field as some famous Irish
literary figures were also well-known in China.

Vice-Chairman Tian, who arrived here Thursday for a five-day
visit, said that he was very pleased to have the opportunity of
meeting the president and conveyed greetings from Chinese
President Jiang Zemin and Qiao Shi, chairman of the Standing
Committee of the Chinese National People's Congress.
</P>

Ireland and China enjoyed traditional friendship in history and
their relations had been developing smoothly over the past few
years with high-level contacts markedly increasing, Tian said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the highly-developed animal industry in Ireland
had given him a very deep-going impression and he hoped the two
countries would further their economic, cultural, educational and
scientific cooperation in the future.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, the Chinese parliament delegation visited the
Dublin Financial Services Development Authority and held talks

<HEADLINE> AL Chief Urges Israel to End Closure of West Bank, Gaza Strip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Arab League (AL) Secretary General
Esmat Abdul-Meguid today called on Israel to end its closure of
the West Bank and Gaza Strip, which has barred hundreds of
thousands of Palestinians from their work in Israel.
</P>
<P>
He said that the continuation of the siege on the Palestinian
territories would jeopardize the Middle East peace process and
lead to instability in the region.
</P>
<P>
The Cairo-based Arab League chief, in a meeting with members of
the Foreign Press Association in Egypt, said Israel should put an
end to its pressures on the Palestinians and commit itself to its
obligations under the agreements it signed with the Arabs.
</P>
<P>
The living conditions in the West Bank and Gaza Strip have
reportedly deteriorated due to the closure imposed since February
25, when Palestinian Islamic extremists started to carry out a
series of suicide bombing attacks in Israel.
</P>
<P>
On the Libya-West crisis caused by the 1988 bombing of a
U.S. passenger plane over Lockerbie, Scotland, Abdul-Meguid said
that Libya has responded positively to all efforts made to settle
the crisis peacefully.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his support to Libya's stance refusing to hand
over two Libyan suspects as long as there are no agreements
between Libya and the Western countries on extradition of
criminals.
</P>
<P>
He also called for lifting the U.N. Security Council sanctions
imposed on Libya, including an air embargo and a ban on the sales
or transfer of weapons and a downgrading of diplomatic relations.
</P>
<P>
The Arab League chief also expressed hope that the U.N. embargo
on Iraq could be lifted and the sufferings of the Iraqi people
alleviated.

ADDIS ABABA, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Sasakawa Global 2000 has
planned to support the Ethiopian government's agricultural
extension program by familiarising peasants with selected seeds,
teaching them how to make silos and preserve grains, Sasakawa
Global 2000 announced here today.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made by Takele Gebre, program coordinator
of Sasakawa Global 2000 against the background that the Ethiopian
government planned to embrace 400,000 farmers in government's
regular extension program this year and a special agricultural
extension program was launched recently in areas with scarce
rainfall and which will benefit 10,000 farmers.
</P>
<P>
Tekele said the Sasakawa Global 2000 is ready to help the
Ethiopian government in its efforts towards ensuring food self
sufficiency. To this end, he said, his organization will
distribute to and acquaint farmers with selected seeds.
</P>
<P>
Sasakawa Global 2000 commenced activities in Ethiopia in 1993
and about 30,000 -40,000 farmers in the country have participated
in the program. Takele Gebre said that the organization has given
selected seeds, fertilizers and loan services to Ethiopian
farmers and taught them how to use modern agricultural imputs.
Per hectare agricultural production has increased with the help
of the orgainzation.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Parliamentary Elections to Go Ahead as Planned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus parliamentary party
representatives decided today in their majority that parliamentary
elections should take place as originally planned on May 26.
</P>
<P>
President of House of Representatives Alexis Galanos told the
press after the meeting that the ruling Democratic Rally Party,
coalition partner Democratic Party and Socialist Edek Party
supported the decision that elections should take place as
originally planned while the opposition left-wing Akel Party
disagreed.
</P>
<P>
On his part, Cyprus Attorney-General Alecos Markides
reaffirmed his position that there are no legal obstacles on
going ahead with holding the elections on May 26.
</P>
<P>
The question rose when the Supreme Court of Cyprus ruled last
Tuesday that the appointment of veteran journalist Christakis
Katsambas as a replacement deputy in February without a
by-election had been unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
Katsambas, a runner-up for the ruling Democratic Rally Party
in the 1991 parliamentary elections, was declared member of the
House of Representatives by the returning officer, when Alecos
Markides, a member of the parliament for the same party, resigned
to become attorney-general of the republic.
</P>
<P>
The court decision has sparked fears that the upcoming
elections will be disrupted since some people have called for the
elections either be brought forward, dissolving the incomplete
House of Representatives early, or postponed till August to allow
time for a by-election.

<HEADLINE> Egypt's Suez Canal Revenues Drop in February </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Revenues from the tolls levied on
vessels passing through Egypt's Suez Canal dropped in February to
145 million U.S. dollars as compared with 163.1 million dollars in
January, Egypt's state-run Middle East News Agency (MENA) reported.
</P>
<P>
In February 1995, the canal earned Egypt 151 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
MENA quoted a bulletin of the Cabinet Information and Decision
Support Center (IDSC) as saying that the drop in revenues was due
to the fact that fewer ships transited through the canal in
February.
</P>
<P>
According to the bulletin issued by the presidency of the
Cabinet, 1,132 vessels passed through the Suez Canal in February
as compared with 1,282 in January. In February last year, a total
of 1,226 ships used the canal.
</P>
<P>
The bulletin also said that the number of oil tankers which
transited through the canal dropped to 192 in February from 230 in
January and 214 in February 1995.
</P>
<P>
Suez Canal revenues are one of the four main sources of Egypt's
foreign exchange income. The other three sources are overseas
remittance, tourism and oil exports.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is now struggling to attract vessels to use the
193-kilometer-long canal, which was opened 126 years ago as a
shortcut between Europe and the Far East, as regional highways,
rail road links, and oil and gas pipelines have been greatly
challenging the canal.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa To Hold First Post-Apartheid Census </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 2 (Xinhua)-- South Africa's first
post-apartheid national census, scheduled for next October,
would give a full profile of the country's population, Census
Coordinator Pali Lehohla said today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters at the launch of a census information
campaign in Pretoria, Lehohla said: ''After years of apartheid this
nation has to know itself in numbers. We hope to reach every woman,
child and man in every corner of the country.''
</P>
<P>
From October 10 until the end of the month, about 70,000
enumerators would visit households to complete questionnaires,
which would be available in all the 11 official languages of the
country.
</P>
<P>
Questions directed at individuals would cover age, gender,
employment, race, marital status and income, among others. A
second set would relate to housing conditions, access to water,
sanitation and telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
Lehohla said the census comprised four phases: demarcation,
enumeration, processing and publishing the results.
</P>
<P>
He said the final result of the census would be announced by
President Nelson Mandela in November next year, although preliminary
figures would be ready for publication in January.
</P>
<P>
The 1996 count would cost taxpayers 365 million Rand (about 96
million US Dollars) or eight Rand (about 3.1 US Dollars) a head, which
Lehohla described as good value for money compared to other countries
in the world.
</P>
<P>
The cost also included a three-million-dollar publicity campaign
to educate people and to call for their cooperation.
</P>
<P>
''This is much less than the Botswana census which cost 3.7 US
dollars a head and much lower than Australia's 5.5 US Dollars and
Canada's 5.8 US dollar,'' he added.

Prospects for Cypriot-U.K. Trade."
</P>
<P>
"Last year, economic activity grew by almost 5 percent, the
rate of inflation dropped to 2.6 percent while the labor market is
characterized by full employment conditions," Christofi said.
</P>
<P>
"Prospects for the current year remain positive with a
projected growth rate of 4 percent," he added.
</P>
<P>
Christofi said that Cyprus has offered multifarious advantages
as a business and services center in the Eastern Mediterranean.
</P>
<P>
He noted that "the importance of Cyprus as a business and
distribution center in the Eastern Mediterranean is highlighted by
the performance of exports and re-exports."
</P>
<P>
In 1995, he said, almost 60 percent of Cyprus' domestic
exports were directed to the European Union, about 18 percent to
Arab countries, 12 percent to former socialist countries and 10
percent to other countries.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the traditional economic relations between Cyprus
and Britain, the minister cited bilateral trade statistics
showing that trade exchanges between the two countries in 1995
reached 379 million pounds sterling.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Britain is also the major tourist market for this
Eastern Mediterranean island while a considerable number of
Cypriots travelling abroad had in 1995 Britain as their final
destination, he said.
</P>
<P>
Christofi expressed belief that the prospects of expanding
further the existing close ties between Cyprus and Britain will be
augmented.

<HEADLINE> Israel Urged to Reopen Palestinian Territories </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 2 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali urged Israel to consider lifting closure of
the Palestinian territories Gaza and the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
In a letter dated last Thursday to Israeli Prime Minister
Shimon Peres, obtained here today, he expressed "profound concern"
that the closures of the Gaza and the West Bank could have a
possible adverse impact on the peace process though he showed
understanding of Israel's determination to ensure the security of
its people after the "horrendous attacks."
</P>
<P>
"A prolonged closure may create a climate of frustration in the
territories in which the ability of the Palestinian Authority to
combat terrorism and to work constructively with the government of
Israel to that end could be seriously hampered," he said.
</P>
<P>
"In view of these serious concerns, I urge you to consider
lifting, at least gradually, the closure of Gaza and the West
Bank," he said.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian President Yasir Arafat also wrote a letter to the
U.N. chief, asking Boutros-Ghali to bring the issue to the "urgent
and immediate attention of the Security Council and General
Assembly of the United Nations."
</P>
<P>
Arafat asked the United Nations to demand that Israel reopen
the West Bank and Gaza, sealed for more than a month in response
to a nine-day wave of suicide bombings from February 25, which
killed 58 people in Israel cities.
</P>
<P>
His letter was sent to U.N. Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-
Ghali last Friday, a day after the U.N. chief wrote to Israeli
Prime Minister.
</P>
<P>
The closure has crippled the Palestinian economy, keeping some
60,000 people from jobs in Israel.
