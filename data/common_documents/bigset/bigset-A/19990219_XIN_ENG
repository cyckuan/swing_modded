<HEADLINE> Intel Corporation Unveils Pentium III </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Intel Corporation, the
giant chip maker, rolled out the Pentium III Wednesday in an
exhibition hall in San Jose, and the company will ship the new
product to PC makers on Feb. 26, said the Washington Post
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
This is reportedly part of Intel's bid to recapture market
share it has steadily been losing to upstart rivals. In last
year's fourth quarter, Intel commanded 76 percent of the chip
market, but significantly less than the 85 percent it held a year
earlier.
</P>
<P>
Intel officials said that the chip will offer jazzier
three-dimensional graphics, smoother video images and enhanced
voice-recognition capabilities. The new chip also contains special
instructions that software makers can use to produce more
sophisticated graphics. More graphically rich online shopping
experiences are also anticipated, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
However, some analysts contend that the chip is only a marginal
improvement over Intel's current offerings.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh's Opposition Announces 60-Hour Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's opposition alliance
Thursday announced a 60-hour countrywide hartal (destructive
strike) from February 23 to 25 to resist the country's municipal
elections.
</P>
<P>
The hartal was announced separately by the major opposition -
the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, the Jatiya Party, the
Jammat-e-Islami and the Islami Oikya Jote (Islamic Solidarity
Front), to protest against the government's rejection of their
four-point demand for joining the polls.
</P>
<P>
The demand includes replacement of the chief election
commissioner, restructuring of the commission, distribution of
voters' identity cards before the polls, and stopping harassing
opposition workers and leaders.
</P>
<P>
"This will be the last hartal to realize the four-point demand.
If the government fails to meet the demands prior to the
shutdowns, the opposition parties will obviously launch a
one-point oust-government movement immediately after the municipal
polls," a member of the liaison committee of the opposition
alliance was quoted by The Daily Star as saying Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The opposition earlier planned a 96-hour hartal, but decided to
shorten the duration to 72 hours Tuesday and announced the hartal
to last 60 hours only Thursday.
</P>
<P>
This would be the third hartal this year, following a
dawn-to-midnight hartal on January 26, the day of submitting
nomination papers for the municipal elections, and a 60-hour
hartal on February 9-11.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Producer Prices Show Biggest Rise Since October 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The Producer Price Index in
January rose 0.5 percent, the biggest increase since October 1996,
after declining 0.1 percent for all of 1998 and 1.2 percent in
1997, the Labor Department reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
However, much of the rise reported in prices for finished goods
was concentrated in just a few items, such as gasoline, pork and
citrus fruit. Prices excluding the volatile food and energy
components actually fell for the first time in seven months,
edging 0.1 percent lower. Analysts believe inflation in prices
paid by consumers will remain muted this year.
</P>
<P>
Prices charged by food producers rose 1.6 percent, the most in
nearly six years, after slipping 0.1 percent during 1998. Energy
prices jumped 1.8 percent, the most in two years, but had fallen
12.1 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
In January, the price of pork shot up 18.3 percent, the largest
one-month increase in nearly 25 years, after falling 26.9 percent
over the course of the previous year in response to diminished
demand in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Economists attributed the rebound, in part, to winter storms,
which resulted in farmers sending fewer animals to slaughter.
</P>
<P>
Fresh fruits and melons cost 19.6 percent more than the month
before, the largest increase in 13 months, reflecting a 56.3
percent rise in citrus fruit and 26.7 percent in strawberries
following a freeze in California.
</P>
<P>
Gasoline prices climbed 6.5 percent, the most in 17 months,
after plunging 34.1 percent last year, and fuel oil increased 6.4
percent.
</P>
<P>
Outside food and energy, car prices fell 1.2 percent last
month, the most in a year and a half, and computer costs declined
4.5 percent.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Pays 814 Million Dollars to Gulf War Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Compensation
Commission (UNCC) has paid out another 814 million U.S. dollars to
the successful claimants in more than 60 countries for their
property losses during the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here Thursday, the UNCC said the sum
included 84.39 million dollars shared by 223,817 Egyptian workers,
who were in Iraq and lost their remittances at the start of the
war.
</P>
<P>
It brought the total amount of compensation, paid out by the
Geneva-based body and funded by 30 percent of revenue from an "oil-
for-food" deal with Iraq, up to 2.7 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
"Payments are made when income from the sale of oil has
accumulated to a level sufficient to pay the amounts due," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
The Governing Council of UNCC, composed of the U.N. Security
Council's 15 member countries, has already approved the latest
repayment, but funds have been still lacking until this week.
</P>
<P>
The UNCC has received claims from individuals, companies and
governments with a total asserted loss of more than 250 billion
dollars, seven billion dollars of which have been approved for
payment.

<HEADLINE> Russia to Cut Export Duties to Spur Foreign Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Russia plans to cut duties on
some exports in half to stimulate foreign investment, the
country's customs chief said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Valery Draganov, chairman of the State Customs Committee, told
a meeting of Russian and German businessmen that the current
duties are too high and that slashing them would be an impetus to
direct foreign investment into Russian industry, Interfax
reported.
</P>
<P>
He listed a number of steps already taken by Moscow in its
efforts to attract more foreign funds.
</P>
<P>
Import duties on industrial components had gone down to about 5
percent, and those on manufactured goods fell by 20 percent to 30
percent.
</P>
<P>
The moves make it more profitable for foreign companies to make
certain types of goods in Russia than to import them into the
country, Draganov said.

<HEADLINE> Chiluba to Discuss Congo Peace With Malawian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba left here this morning for Malawi to discuss his peace
efforts to end the six- month conflict in the Democratic Republic
of Congo (DRC) with Malawian President Bakili Muluzi.
</P>
<P>
Before leaving for Malawi, Chiluba, mandated by Southern
African Development Community (SADC) to mediate in the DRC war,
said, "I just returned from seeing President Mandela yesterday and
next week I will be either in Uganda or Mozambique to have
conference with the presidents so that we find a day we can
convene to have the cease-fire signed."
</P>
<P>
Chiluba's visit to Malawi is in the wake of a similar one to
South Africa Wednesday, where he discussed the progress in his
peace efforts with Nelson Mandela.
</P>
<P>
For the regional summit to be convened as early as possible in
Lusaka to secure a truce in DRC, Chiluba is shuttling between
concerned African countries.
</P>
<P>
The long-awaited Lusaka summit to seek a peaceful solution to
the crisis in DRC has been postponed several times from the
originally planned date of December 8 of last year because of the
disagreement on the presence of the rebels.
</P>
<P>
Kabila refuses to have direct talks with the rebels of the
Congolese Rally for Democracy (RCD) led by Ernest Wamba Dia Wamba,
but Rwanda and Uganda backing the rebels demand the involvement of
the rebels in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The rebels said any deal reached without them will be useless
and repeatedly called for direct talks with Kabila, who now
expressed his readiness to meet the rebels in Kinshasa or even out
of the capital city.
</P>
<P>
The six-month-old war has dragged in six countries and
threatens to become a full-scale multi-national conflict in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe, Angola, Namibia and Chad have sent their troops there
to back Kabila while Rwanda and Uganda have been accused of
backing the rebels although they said they deployed troops in DRC
for their own security interests and accused Kabila of backing
their anti-government forces.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Meets on U.N. Role in Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council Thursday met behind closed doors to discuss how to respond
to a letter from the Angolan government which asked for the exit
of U.N. peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
A presidential statement is expected to be issued at the end of
the 15-nation council's consultations on the letter transmitted
Friday to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
At issue is whether the United Nations moves to withdraw the
1,000-member U.N. Observer Mission in Angola (MONUA) after its
mandate expires on February 26.
</P>
<P>
In his letter, Angolan President Eduardo dos Santos told Annan
that his government has rejected a U.N. political or military
presence in his war-torn country, but he wants U.N. relief workers
to stay.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan president said he turned down any future presence
for the MONUA, "no matter what the form." The rebel leader, Jonas
Savimbi, had ignored all peace agreements to date, he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council, in its January 21 resolution, called
for a "continued multidisciplinary presence" of the United Nations
in Angola. This would have included some military observers as
well basing Annan's special representative in the African
country's capital of Luanda.
</P>
<P>
But dos Santos said the special representative should be based
in New York and be able to "work with the Angolan government in
the follow-up of developments," said the letter.
</P>
<P>
Annan had already proposed that the MONUA end its peacekeeping
mission in the southwestern African nation in this month. The bulk
of the operation, including his special representative Issa
Diallo, should be out of the country by March 20, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, the Security Council has voiced its hope a reduced
MONUA could continue to operate in the country, even if under
other name.
</P>
<P>
The latest round of fighting, which broke out in early December
last year, is escalating, thus plunging the U.N. peacekeeping
operation in Angola into a standstill.
</P>
<P>
The breakdown of a 1994 peace accord is mainly blamed on UNITA,
headed by Savimbi, which refused to hand over land under its
control to a national unity government and did not disarm its
fighters as called for in the peace agreement, known as the Lusaka
Protocol.

<HEADLINE> Mugabe Criticizes Press Tarnishing Zimbabwe's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mugabe was speaking at a belated new year reception for heads
of foreign missions and international organizations at state house
here. He said the media had formulated a perception of a
constitutional crisis which, however, did not exist.
</P>
<P>
"We are committed as a government to ensuring that as many
views and contributions are taken into account as we undertake
this very important task," said Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
He said that in all democracies there existed a certain amount
of tension between the legislature, the judiciary and the
executive but that did not always amount to a constitutional
crisis.
</P>
<P>
Apparently referring to a recent letter by some judges to the
president after the detention of two local journalists over an
attempted coup story, Mugabe said the judges had arrogated
themselves certain powers not bestowed upon them by the
constitution of the country.
</P>
<P>
He repeated his call for judges to refrain from making
political comments on issues which had not been brought before the
courts.
</P>
<P>
Speaking about the country's land redistribution program, the
president said the Zimbabwean government appreciated the support
different countries and organizations had pledged to offer to help
the country move forward with the land redistribution program.
</P>
<P>
"This program is both necessary and crucial for the substance
of national unity, peace and stability in this country," he said.
</P>
<P>
On Zimbabwe's intervention in the Democratic Republic of Congo
(DRC) war, Mugabe said there were different erroneous perceptions
against Zimbabwe, instead of condemning Rwanda and Uganda for
their violation of the DRC's territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
"Our interest is the achievement and sustenance of peace and
stability not only in fellow member states of the Southern African
Development Community but in the entire region," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
"We do not wish for the war in the DRC to continue any day
longer than the duration of the invasion of that country by Uganda
and Rwanda," he said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Dismisses Yeltsin's Warning Against NATO in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The White House Thursday
dismissed Russian President Boris Yeltsin's warning that he would
not let NATO use force against Yugoslavia over the Kosovo
conflict.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Yeltsin said in televised comments that he
had conveyed to U.S. President Bill Clinton both by phone and by
letter that "this (threatened military strikes against Yugoslavia)
will not work.... We will not let you touch Kosovo."
</P>
<P>
In respond to Yeltsin's comment, White House spokesman P. J.
Crowley said there had been no recent communication between the
two presidents, but that Moscow's opposition to NATO's use of
force in Kosovo was well known.
</P>
<P>
"The Russian position is long held," he said. "What is
confusing us is there has not been a telephone call or written
communication between the two presidents in recent days."
</P>
<P>
Clinton did not respond when asked about Yeltsin's comments as
he left the White House to travel to New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
Crowley said Washington, Moscow and NATO were hopeful that
Serbs and ethnic Albanians could reach a peace agreement on
Kosovo's future at talks in Rambouillet, France, where negotiators
were "working steadfastly" to bring the two sides together.
</P>
<P>
"The United States ad Russia would both prefer a political
settlement, but NATO has made it clear it is prepared to take
action," Crowley said.

<HEADLINE> Russia to Increase Coal Export </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Russia should boost its coal
exports by 50 percent in 1999, Deputy Prime Minister Vladimir
Bulgak said Thursday at a cabinet session on the coal industry.
</P>
<P>
"Exports at 10 percent of production are clearly not enough,"
Bulgak said. "The presence of Russian coal on CIS (Commonwealth of
Independent States) and foreign markets must increase."
</P>
<P>
Bulgak said a rise in exports would require the construction of
new coal terminals at Baltic ports, Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
The government has planned to take several protectionist steps
concerning the industry, specifically a financing schedule for the
first six months of 1999 twice the size of last year's.
</P>
<P>
Talks have virtually ended regarding the disbursement of a
tranche of a World Bank coal loan. Bulgak said that two tranches
totaling 400 million U.S. dollars will be split into six portions
to be disbursed this year.
</P>
<P>
Bulgak said the government will pay special attention to the
welfare of coal miners, including the resumption of resettlement
from the Far North and the issuing of housing certificates to coal
miners.

<HEADLINE> Protesters Dump Soya Beans at Downing Street </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Activists opposed to
genetically-modified (GM) food dumped four tons of GM soya beans
outside Downing Street Thursday as the government signals it may
bow to a ban on the crops.
</P>
<P>
The protest came after a series of scare stories surrounding GM
foods and allegations the government was split or performing a
U-turn on the issue.
</P>
<P>
However, the government Thursday denied making a U-turn over GM
crops.
</P>
<P>
The Greenpeace activists targeted Prime Minister Tony Blair's
official residence after his spokesman said he was happy to
consume GM food.
</P>
<P>
"We are taking these GM soya beans to one of the few homes in
Britain where they want to eat it," a spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
Greenpeace said all seven activists involved in delivering the
beans had been arrested outside the Downing Street gates.
</P>
<P>
But the government appears to be considering changing tack on
the wider issue of growing GM crops after a public outcry.
</P>
<P>
Ministers said Wednesday night they could extend the moratorium
on growing GM food in Britain after previously insisting no reason
existed for doing this.

HARARE, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe and the United States
Thursday signed here a memorandum of understanding on the
implementation of a cooperation arrangement on recruitment of

<P>
Speaking at the signing ceremony, Zimbabwean Mines, Environment

of two years in the fields of business, environmental and
agroforestry administration and management.
</P>
<P>
The program is the result of a six-year collaboration effort
with the Peace Corps of the U.S., Chipato said.

Zimbabwe through the implementation of a technical support unit to
finance the consultation work.
</P>

Director of the U.S. Agency for International Development, Rose

</P>
<P>
She said that the unit will also receive support from various

</P>
<P>
"We hope that by the time the government completes its
implementation plan for the inception phase, the unit will be
operational," she added.

</P>
<P>
Oil Undersecretary Faaiz Abdullah Shahin in a statement that
efforts are being made to help Syria renovate its part of the
pipeline as as to export Iraqi oil as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Iraq and Syria agreed last July to reopen the oil pipeline
linking Kirkuk oil fields in northern Iraq and the Syrian Banyas
terminal 17 years after it was closed.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi-Syrian oil pipeline was shut in 1982 during the
Iraq-Iran war when Syria sided with Iran.
</P>
<P>
Shahin said that the two countries are determined to restore
the capacity of the pipeline which amounted to 2.4 million barrels
per day in the early 1980s, the Iraqi News Agency reported.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa, US Sign Trade Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 18 (Xinhua) -- South African Deputy
President Thabo Mbeki and his United States counterpart, Al Gore,
Thursday announced a new trade and investment framework agreement,
South African Press Association (SAPA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the end of a plenary session of the U.S.-South
African Bi- national Commission (BNC) in Cape Town, they said the
agreement will create a bilateral council on trade and investment
that will meet regularly.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed by South African Trade and Industry
Minister Alec Erwin and U.S. Commerce Secretary William Daley,
SAPA said.
</P>
<P>
South African government officials said earlier that the
agreement will create mechanisms to solve trade disputes,
including South Africa's concerns that its steel industry was
being unfairly targeted by U.S. anti- dumping actions.
</P>
<P>
Another issue will be Washington's complaint that South Africa
was violating its World Trade Organization obligations by
threatening pharmaceutical patent rights.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki and Gore also announced the establishment of a new BNC
committee -- the justice and anti-crime cooperation committee --
co-chaired by U.S. Attorney-General Janet Reno and South African
Safety and Security Minister Sydney Mufamadi.
</P>
<P>
Other agreements at this year's session include an agreement to
work together to promote clean energy initiatives that will
address climate change goals while promoting economic growth.
</P>
<P>
They also agreed to elevate the housing working group to full
committee status within the BNC.
</P>
<P>
The BNC was established in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Baltic Leaders Want NATO's Clear Position on Membership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The three Baltic states
Thursday called for a clear position on their NATO membership at
the upcoming summit of the transatlantic defense alliance.
</P>
<P>
In a statement signed by Estonian President Lennart Meri,
Lithuanian President Valdas Adamkus and Latvian President Guntis
Ulmanis, the three countries said they expect the NATO summit in
Washington next April to make its position clear on admitting them
into the alliance, Interfax reported in a dispatch from Tallinn,
capital of Estonia.
</P>
<P>
The presidents hope the summit will define their countries as
having made progress in the development of stability and
cooperation with NATO.
</P>
<P>
They believe their countries have indeed been successful in
economic development, defense cooperation and relations with
neighboring countries since the Madrid summit in 1997 at which
Hungary, the Czech Republic and Poland were invited into NATO.
</P>
<P>
"That progress should be adequately recognized and the Baltic
countries must be named at the Washington meeting as potential
NATO members," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The presidents pledged to do their best to meet NATO's
criteria, the document said.
</P>
<P>
Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania have been pressing for NATO
membership, but the West is not especially eager to admit them,
largely because Moscow has said it will change its relations with
NATO if those countries are admitted into it, observers said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. FAA Orders Inspections for Older Boeing 727s </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA) ordered operators of 1,000 older Boeing 727s
Thursday to inspect skin joints on the aircraft for fatigue
cracking and make any necessary repairs.
</P>
<P>
The airworthiness directive was prompted by reports of fatigue
cracks in four Boeing 727s operating in the U.S. commercial
airline fleet.
</P>
<P>
It is also an outgrowth of the aging aircraft program begun
with the aviation industry in 1988. The program is designed to
ensure that aircraft remain as structurally sound throughout their
service life as they were when they were originally certified.
</P>
<P>
The airworthiness directive applies to Boeing 727-100, -100C,
-200, -200F, and 727C aircraft, airplanes that have an engine on
each side of the tail cone and one built into the tail itself.
</P>
<P>
The average age of the aircraft is 25 years, or approximately
38,000 flight cycles.
</P>
<P>
Operators must perform repetitive visual inspections of
portions of lower skin lap joint -- an area where overlapping
sections of the plane are joined -- within 15 days or 50 flight
cycles, whichever occurs first, the FAA said.
</P>
<P>
The inspections must be performed prior to accumulation of
40,000 total flight cycles.
</P>
<P>
In addition, repetitive low frequency eddy current inspections
must be performed within 60 days or 300 flight cycles to detect
potential small cracks in the fuselage. Eddy current inspections
are electronic examinations used to detect cracks not visible to
the eye.
</P>
<P>
Worldwide, 1,516 Boeing 727s are affected by the airworthiness
directive, 1,000 of which are U.S.-registered. Foreign carriers do
not have to comply with FAA orders, but international civil
aviation authorities usually heed each other's safety warnings.

<HEADLINE> FM: Russia to Ponder Joining Int'l Presence in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov said here Thursday that Russia will consider joining the
international presence in Kosovo if the two warring parties reach
a political agreement in Rambouillet, France.
</P>
<P>
If no agreement is reached by Serbia and the Kosovo Albanians,
the Contact Group will have to gather for a session once more to
decide what to do to promote a political settlement, Ivanov told
reporters following his talks with visiting German Foreign
Minister Joshka Fischer.
</P>
<P>
"There can be no other way of settling this problem," Ivanov
said, echoing President Boris Yeltsin's pronouncement earlier
Thursday against force or the threat of force in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, in live television remarks he had conveyed to U.S.
President Bill Clinton both by phone and by letter, said that
"this (the threatened military strikes against Yugoslavia) will
not work.... We will not let you touch Kosovo."
</P>
<P>
However, the White House dismissed Yeltsin's warning, saying
there had been no recent communication between the two presidents,
but that Moscow's opposition to NATO's us of force in Kosovo was
well known.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov noted that "all of us (in the Contact Group) are willing
to work out a political settlement and to avoid a deterioration of
the situation in and around Kosovo." The six-nation Contact Group
on former Yugoslavia, of which Russia is a member, "has agreed to
make active efforts for the participants in the Rambouillet talks
to work out political agreements on the settlement of the Kosovo
problem before the deadline (noon February 20)," Ivanov said.
</P>
<P>
Fischer, for his part, dismissed allegations that Germany was
anti-Serbian for historical reasons.
</P>
<P>
"Serbs make up one of the largest ethnic minorities in Germany,
and Germans bear no ill will toward the Serbian nation," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Our common history with Russia is even more dramatic than that
with Serbia, but we have managed to build constructive, friendly
relations," Fischer said.
</P>
<P>
He accused Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic of pursuing a
policy that "may lead to a disaster for that country."
</P>
<P>
"If it continues doing what it is doing, Belgrade will lose
Kosovo. Serbia is already isolated," Fischer said, adding that "no
Western country wants Kosovo to split from Yugoslavia."
</P>
<P>
He urged all parties to the Rambouillet talks to seize the
opportunity to settle the Kosovo problem by making the area
autonomous under supervision by the international community.
</P>
<P>
"If this chance is not seized, Kosovo will split from
Yugoslavia, whether Milosevic wants it or not," Fischer said.
</P>
<P>
"Those who regard themselves as friends of Serbia must
influence Belgrade into agreeing to a peaceful political
resolution of the Kosovo problem," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The only other alternative is war," Fisher said.

<HEADLINE> No Intelligence Leak in Israel's Commando Mission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 18 (Xinhua) -- A committee investigating
the failed Israeli commando mission in southern Lebanon in 1997
said on Thursday that there was no intelligence leak about the
mission.
</P>
<P>
The committee, appointed by Chief of General Staff of Israel
Defense Forces Lt. Gen. Shaul Mofaz, said in its report that the
Lebanese Hezbollah guerillas who killed 11 members of the Israeli
elite naval commando unit did not have details of the mission in
advance.
</P>
<P>
Previous investigations also said that there were no signs of
such an intelligence leak, but parents of the victims were not
satisfied with the investigation.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli naval commandos were killed in a Hezbollah ambush
in September 1997 when they landed at the port city of Tyre. It
was believed that the guerilla forces may have had advanced
information about the mission, enabling them to stage the ambush.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the ambush was most likely to be the
result of an intensified alertness by the Hezbollah guerillas.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon in
1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese
guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, has been since
spearheading a guerrilla war to oust Israeli occupation troops.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan President on Environmental Degradation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni has said that poverty is the major cause of environmental
degradation in the Lake Victoria Basin.
</P>
<P>
This is contained in a speech read for him Thursday by Third
Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Disaster Preparedness and
Refugees, Paul Etiang, at the inauguration ceremony of Lake
Victoria Local Authorities Cooperation Constitution in Entebbe, 45
kilometers south of capital Kampala.
</P>
<P>
Museveni noted that poverty is the common enemy in the Lake
Victoria Basin and there is therefore need for leaders in the
region to balance the quest for prosperity through proper
utilization of the lake resources and to ensure sustainable and
effective preservation of the environment.
</P>
<P>
He also cautioned against indiscriminate fishing and
deforestation, saying that they are a big environmental menace in
the region.
</P>
<P>
Stephen Kabuuye, Chairman of Lake Victoria Region Local
Authorities Cooperation and Mayor of Entebbe, said that the
cooperation aims at uniting and working out modalities and means
of facing environmental challenges which affect local authorities
in the region.

KAMPALA, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Uganda, as a developing
country, needs assistance to understand all the legal
requirements, opportunities and obligations presented by the
globalization of trade under the World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
This is revealed at a round-table meeting on the WTO for
stakeholders in Uganda at the International Conference Center here
Thursday, the Uganda News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Government officials and representatives of the private sector
discussed institutional capacity building for the country, setting

participation in the WTO.
</P>
<P>
Peter Eyetu, head of WTO desk in the Ugandan Ministry of Trade

from the richer WTO members. This is provided for under the
international legal framework that governs the organization.
</P>
<P>
Training of trainers, market studies and strengthening of
trade-related institutions are some of the activities which are
under way to get Uganda ready to take full advantage of the WTO
provisions.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Chirac Visit U.S. on Security, Iraq, Financial Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 18 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques
Chirac arrived in Washington Thursday for a two-day visit to the
United States and will hold talks with President Bill Clinton on a
wide range of issues, the White House said.
</P>
<P>
The leaders will discuss Kosovo, NATO's 50th anniversary summit
in Washington in April, Iraq, Russia and global financial issues,
White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
Besides meeting with Clinton Friday, Chirac will also see the
heads of the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the
Inter-American Development Bank.
</P>
<P>
On Kosovo, Chirac has said France and the United States are on
the same wave length. France is hosting talks in Rambouillet near
Paris while U.S.-led NATO is poised for either air strikes once
the Serbs and ethic Albanians fail to reach an peace accord or
send peacekeeping troops into Kosovo if the accord is reached.
</P>
<P>
With regard to Iraq, while Chirac pointed out common points
with Washington, he would try to persuade Clinton to lift embargo
on Iraqi oil in exchange for renewing weapons inspections in that
country.
</P>
<P>
But the United States, whose objective is to topple Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein, is skeptical about Chirac's plan.
</P>
<P>
Chirac also wants to make progress on reducing world financial
volatility. "The world financial system needs to be changed
because the world had changed.... I think we should have better
organization," he said.
</P>
<P>
France has proposed assigning trading levels, or bands, for
currencies to reduce volatility among the U.S. dollar, Europe's
new euro, and the Japanese yen, an idea Germany and Japan support.
According to the proposal, countries would be committed to
intervene by buying and selling currencies on the open market to
maintain those exchange rates.
</P>
<P>
Although Clinton supports those calling for a new global
"financial architecture" to prevent future Asian-style currency
crisis, the United States remains opposed to setting target ranges
for currency values.
</P>
<P>
Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said Wednesday that he believed
such proposals would probably at some point be at odds with U.S.
domestic economic interests.
</P>
<P>
Chirac also wants to improve market regulation and to involve
the private sector in the solution of financial crises.

<HEADLINE> Israel Introduces Rules on Election Campaigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 18 (Xinhua) -- With the new general
elections three months away, rules governing election campaigns
went into effect Thursday in Israel.
</P>
<P>
In general, the eight-point rules stipulated what a party or a
candidate may do during the election campaigns, and they strictly
pointed out no loudspeakers, torches, videos and other specified
means of advertisements may be deployed until the elections.
</P>
<P>
The rules also stipulated the size the billboards, the
designated areas that the billboards may be posted and the number
of election advertisements that may appear in daily newspapers.
</P>
<P>
Israel's new elections are set for May 17 this year, in which
the voters will choose prime minister and members of Knesset
(parliament) simultaneously. But if the prime minister can not be
decided on that day, then a run-off will be held on June 1.
</P>
<P>
Political party registrations ended last Thursday and a total
of 22 new parties registered with the party registrar, bringing to
56 the number of parties on the books.
</P>
<P>
But the party registrar said that many of the 56 parties
registered do not intend running and several are expected to pull
out of the race by the May elections.
</P>
<P>
Among the major political parties, both the Likud and Labor
have already finished their elections of Knesset candidates on
February 8 and February 15 respectively.
</P>
<P>
So far, prime minister candidates included Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu of Likud, Labor party chairman Ehud Barak, The
Centrist party leader Yitzhak Mordechai and Herut (liberal party)
leader Benny Begin.
</P>
<P>
Local Hebrew paper Ma'ariv published its election polls
Thursday, indicating Barak received 44.5 percent of votes among
511 respondents.
</P>
<P>
Among other prime minister candidates, Netanyahu got 36.7
percent, Mordechai 16.4 percent and Begin 2.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
The polls also showed that Labor received 41.3 percent of the
total votes, while Likud got 26.5 percent and the Centrist party
11 percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright Thursday warned Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic of the threat of NATO air strikes if a peace accord on
Kosovo was not reached before the NATO-imposed deadline at noon
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"I spoke with him this morning... and I think he understands
that this is a key moment in terms of the future of the former
Republic of Yugoslavia," Albright said after a meeting withe
Norwegian Foreign Minister Knut Vollebaek.
</P>
<P>
"He should understand that if air strikes occur he will be hit
hard and he will be deprived of the things he values," Albright
added.
</P>
<P>
Albright said progress "was far too slow" at the peace talks in
Rambouillet, France, and she stressed that both the Serbs and
ethnic Albanians should not underestimate the cost of rejecting a
peace deal.
</P>
<P>
The secretary of state also said evacuation plans were in the
advanced stage ahead of a noon Saturday deadline when NATO air
strikes could begin if talks failed.
</P>
<P>
She said she talked with the Norwegian foreign minister, also
head of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
(OSCE), the "very real possibility" that if the current stalemate
continued, the OSCE's verification mission would have to be
evacuated ahead of NATO air strikes.
</P>
<P>
"The next two days will show whether such action is indeed
necessary. I think I can speak for the (Norwegian) foreign
minister in saying that we are both confident that the mission and
NATO are ready for any eventuality," she said.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Raps Kurdish Attacks on Diplomatic Missions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Turkey on Thursday strongly
condemned violent attacks by angry Kurds on its diplomatic
institutions in western Europe.
</P>
<P>
A Foreign Ministry statement was issued after Abdullah Ocalan,
leader of the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK), was captured
and brought back to Turkey early Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
PKK members launched attacks on the embassies of Israel, the
United States, Kenya and Greece in western Europe in protest of
Ocalan's arrest.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan, who led the Kurds in a bloody struggle for independence
in southeastern Turkey which claimed more than 37,000 lives in 14
years, was reportedly detained at the Greek embassy in Kenya, with
the assistance of U.S. and Israeli intelligence.
</P>
<P>
Both the U.S. and Israel denied their reported involvement.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish statement said Ankara will work closely with the
international community to fight against terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Turkey also denounced the PKK for threatening or attacking
Turkish diplomatic missions, institutions and citizens in western
Europe.
</P>
<P>
Turkey calls for the most tight security measures to be taken
around the embassies of the countries concerned, said the
statement.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit confirmed Wednesday that Ocalan
had been sent to a jail on Imrali Island in Marmara Sea near
Turkey's western province of Bursa.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit said that Ocalan's capture came after a secret, 12-day
operation, which was only known to 10 senior Turkish officials.
</P>
<P>
The Ankara State Security Court has sent three prosecutors to
interrogate Ocalan, Turkey's Anatolia News Agency reported on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan, who had been leading the PKK in fighting a war for
independence in southeastern Turkey, was ousted by Syria, his
long-time hideout, in October under immense pressure from Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit also said that the Turkish security forces Wednesday
started extensive cross-border operations against the PKK in
northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Turkish warplanes and Cobra helicopters destroyed shelters and
camps of the PKK in the region, said Anatolia.

</P>
<P>
Mozambican Deputy Minister of Planning and Finance, Luisa

independence against Ankara.
</P>
<P>
The PKK sought shelters in northern Iraq's Kurdish autonomous
region in the wake of the 1991 Gulf War, when Baghdad virtually
lost its control there. Turkish troops crossed into Iraq for a
number of times in trying to wipe out the rebels.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz on Wednesday concluded
his visit to Ankara during which he held talks with the Turkish
prime minister and other officials on improving bilateral
relations.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that the Turkish incursions contradict the
U.N. Charter and principles of international law, and that Iraqi
government rejects all the pretexts used by Turkey to justify its
aggression.
</P>
<P>
This Turkish aggression coincides with the "criminal actions"
taken by the U.S. and Britain against Iraq in an attempt to
prolong the abnormal situation in northern Iraq, said the
spokesman, who was not identified.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led western allies imposed the no-fly zones in Iraq in
following the Gulf War with a claimed aim of protecting the Kurds
in the north and the Shiite Muslims in the south from Baghdad's
suppression.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman added that Iraq has warned several times the
consequences of the double-standard policy pursued by Turkey on
the situation in northern Iraq and its participation in the
U.S. and British scheme against Iraq by allowing them to use its
air base to attack Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's request for Turkey for stop the use of the air base by
the U.S. was rejected during Aziz's visit.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad had never recognized the validity of the no-fly zones
because of their lack of U.N. authorization and announced it would
fire at U.S.-British warplanes patrolling the zones. There have
been almost daily clashes between Iraqi air defense units and
U.S. and British jets since the mid-December bombings against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
An Iraqi military spokesman announced that 10 formations of
U.S.-British warplanes from Turkish air base violated Iraqi air
space in the north Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that the authority of the central government
should be restored in the north, which he said is the only way to
ensure the security and stability in the region, and that Iraq and
Turkey must cooperate to put an end to the "odd situation" there.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Urges Ankara to Observe International Norms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus on Thursday called on
Ankara to comply with international norms in dealing with the
Kurdish leader Abdullah Ocalan issue.
</P>
<P>
It also urged the international community to make utmost
efforts to protect Ocalan, leader of Turkey's outlawed Turkish
Workers' Party (PKK) fighting for independence of Kurds.
</P>
<P>
A resolution adopted unanimously by the Cyprus House of
Representatives, or parliament, described the "kidnaping and
arrest" of Ocalan as a "provocative and unacceptable act towards
international law."
</P>
<P>
Ocalan, who had been leading the PKK in fighting for
independence in southeast Turkey, was arrested in Kenya earlier
this week and was taken to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The resolution also stressed that every person has undeniable
human rights and every country has its international obligations.
</P>
<P>
It expressed "disappointment and bitterness with the cynicism
and indifference with which the international community is
following the criminal pursue of the leader of the Kurds."
</P>
<P>
It called on the international community to show due interest
and to intervene in the matter.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus parliament expressed "its full solidarity towards
the Kurdish people and its just struggle."
</P>
<P>
Turkey condemned Ocalan for being responsible for the PKK war
with Ankara which has claimed over 37,000 lives since August
1984. Ocalan may face the death penalty if tried.

<HEADLINE> Kurdish Rebel Leader to Be Tried Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah
Ocalan will be tried soon by Ankara State Security Court on
Imrali Island in Marmara Sea near Turkey's western province of
Bursa, where he is currently being held, sources here said.
</P>
<P>
His trial is thought to be one of the most significant in
Turkish history because of the possible consequences it may have
on the future of Turkey's relations with its neighbors such as
Greece and Syria.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan, leader of the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK),
was arrested in Nairobi, capital of Kenya and brought back to
Turkey by a private plane early Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He faces the death penalty in the case filed in the Ankara
State Security Court that accused him of being responsible for the
14-year-old bloody fightings killing over 37,000.
</P>
<P>
A police team comprising eight senior police officers traveled
to Imrali on Thursday and will remaim there until the conclusion
of preliminary questioning.
</P>
<P>
The court proceedings, during which Ocalan will be tried
within the framework of Article 125 of the Turkish Penal Code,
will begin as soon as possible after the completion of the
interrogation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Turkish Foreign Ministry said in a statement
Thursday that nobody should doubt the independence of the Turkish
judicial system.
</P>
<P>
"All institutions and authorities fully respect the
independence of Turkish justice and expect the same respect from
foreign circles," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
It added that "Turkey will not permit any interference with
the independence of the Turkish judicial system."
</P>
<P>
Ocalan, who had been leading the PKK in fighting for
independence in southeastern Turkey, was ousted by Syria, his
long-time hideout, in October under immense pressure from
Turkey.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Sacks Official Who Backfires on the Ocalan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government fired
its top immigration official Thursday, following his comments
Wednesday that Kenya was involved in the capture of Turkey's rebel
Kurdish Workers Party leader Abdullah Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
Principal Immigration Officer Frank Kwinga irked senior
government officials by telling Reuters that Kenyan officials had
physically put Ocalan on a flight out of Kenya, which contradicted
Foreign Minister Bonaya Godana's denial of any Kenyan role in
Ocalan's transfer to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Kwinga said that the Kenyans took an active role in throwing
the kurdish rebel leader out of the country.
</P>
<P>
"We did our job, which was to flush him out,'' he said. "We
sent him away and are very happy that he no longer is here. We
sent the right man away. We put him on a flight.''
</P>
<P>
After Ocalan was flown out of Kenya Monday, he landed in Turkey
Tuesday and now faces charges of treason for leading a 14-year
guerrilla war for Kurdish self-rule.
</P>
<P>
Kurdish protesters stormed three of Kenya's embassies in Europe
after hearing of Ocalan's arrest Tuesday and the Kenyan government
has since closed all its embassies abroad to avoid further
attacks.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan authorities are reportedly holding four of Ocalan's
associates, who were with him when he flew into Kenya under a
false identity on February 2.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Norwegian Prime Minister Kjell
Magne Bondevik is scheduled to pay a two-day visit to Egypt next
Wednesday, the Norwegian embassy in Cairo said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Bondevik's visit is part of his Middle East tour, which will
start with a trip to Israel, the embassy said.
</P>
<P>
The visit is aimed at enhancing trade, economic and investment
cooperation between Egypt and Norway and looking into the
possibility of increasing Norwegian investments in Egypt, the
sources added.
</P>
<P>
Bondevik will hold talks with his Egyptian counterpart Kamal
El-Ganzouri to discuss ways of promoting bilateral trade and
economic ties.
</P>
<P>
During his stay, a joint seminar will be held on investment
opportunities in Egypt, which will be attended by businessmen of
the two countries, the sources added.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers will also discuss the latest developments of
the Middle East peace process, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Norway hosted the secret talks between the Palestinians and
Israel on the principle declaration of the interim Palestinian
self-rule in the West Bank and Gaza signed in 1993. It is able, to
some extent, to exert influence on the peace talks between the two
sides.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli talks have remained stalled due to
Israel's failure to carry out the Wye peace agreement signed last
October.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Israel should pull back troops from
another 13 percent of the West Bank in three phase. But the Jewish
state suspended the implementation of the accord after the first
phase of the withdrawal in early December.

OTTAWA, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Canada's annual inflation rate
fell in January to 0.6 per cent, from one per cent in December,
Statistics Canada reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The inflation rate has been fluctuating between 0.7 per cent
and one per cent since November 1997 in the country.
</P>
<P>
Falling gasoline prices, coupled with lower prices for
telephone services, computers and fuel oil helped keep a damper on
inflation last month, StatsCan said.
</P>
<P>
The major contributors to higher prices last month were
increased food prices, especially for fresh fruit and restaurant
meals, as well as higher costs for piped gas, tuition fees and
property taxes.
</P>
<P>
Discount packages for long-distance phone call dropped the cost
of phone service by 7.6 per cent, the largest decrease ever.

<HEADLINE> Five S. African Govt. Departments Not Ready for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 18 (Xinhua) -- At least five government
departments -- health, defense, transport, labor and justice --
have not yet made their computers year 2000 (Y2K) compliant, South
African Press Association (SAPA) reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Failure to do so will leave the departments vulnerable to
problems associated with the so-called Millennium Bug, and could
result in some of their activities and functions which depend on
computer backup grinding to a halt in January next year.
</P>
<P>
The problems the five departments appear to be experiencing in
achieving full Y2K compliance came to light Wednesday with the
tabling in parliament of a follow-up report by the auditor-general
on the impact of the Y2K problem on computer systems in national
departments and provincial administrations, said SAPA.
</P>
<P>
The report said the departments had cited time constraints,
insufficient funds, and lack of man power and resources, as the
main reasons for not being ready in time.
</P>
<P>
SAPA quoted spokesman for the auditor-general's office, Louis
van Rooyen, as saying that the departments ran the risk of not
being ready by the end of the year.

<HEADLINE> Russia-EU Summit Achieves Limited Results </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The Russian-European Union
summit on Thursday produced limited results aside from a food aid
deal and reaffirmation for efforts to further their cooperation.
</P>
<P>
In what was described as "candid" talks at the Kremlin, Russian
President Boris Yeltsin, Jacques Santer, head of the European
Union's Executive Commission, and German Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder, whose country holds the current EU presidency, centered
their attention to ways to move Russia out of the economic morass.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the meeting, Santer only said the summit inspired
"great hopes for successful development" of Russian-EU relations,
Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
He said the Russian side had urged the EU to help secure more
investments from European banks, but the EU only expressed its
readiness to "consider the possibility of financing individual
Russian projects," adding that the question needs to be discussed
in more detail.
</P>
<P>
Dmitry Yakushkin, Yeltsin's spokesman, told the NTV television
that Yeltsin stressed that Russia would never beg any one for
help, but it would not turn down international assistance if the
world community shows solidarity with her.
</P>
<P>
Santer, who also met with Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov on Thursday, told reporters after the meeting that the EU
and Russia will sign a protocol on food aid to Russia on Friday in
what is believed to be the most tangible result of the day.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also discussed trade and such international
issues as Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Hans van den Broek, an EU commissioner in charge of relations
with Russia acknowledged the need to increase trade, noting that
last year exports from the EU to Russia dropped by 50 percent. He
urged the Russian government to remove barriers between Russia and
the European Union.
</P>
<P>
On Kosovo, Yeltsin reiterated the Russian view that there can
be no alternative to political settlement, Yakushkin said.
</P>
<P>
In a joint statement issued after the summit, the two sides
"agreed with the urgent need for an interim political settlement
of the Kosovo crisis on the basis of the contact group plan."
</P>
<P>
They also discussed the Middle East peace process cooperation
in non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their
delivery vehicles, the statement said.

<HEADLINE> Sudan Assured Arab League's Support for Integrity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Arab League chief Esmat Abdel
Meguid said on Thursday that he has assured Sudanese officials the
league's support for its territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters upon return to Cairo after ending visits
to Kuwait and Sudan, Abdel Meguid said that he has also expressed
the league's support for Khartoum's endeavor to resolve its
long-running problem in the south peacefully.
</P>
<P>
A Pharmaceutical plant near the Sudanese capital was attacked
by United States missiles in August on the pretext that it is used
by terrorists in producing chemical weapon precursors.
</P>
<P>
The Arab League condemned the attack on the Sudanese civil
target, which reportedly accounted for half of the medicines for
the country's domestic market.
</P>
<P>
In the south, Sudanese rebels have been fighting since 1983
against government troops for greater autonomy for the Christians
and animists from the Muslim government in Khartoum.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have held several rounds of negotiations but
failed to reach agreement on a peaceful settlement.
</P>
<P>
Meguid said that during his visit to Kuwait, he discussed with
officials there the Gulf situation and the issue of Kuwaiti
prisoners held in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain launched a four-day air attack on Iraq in
mid-December for what the U.S. said Baghdad's failure to comply
with the United Nations weapons inspections.
</P>
<P>
The attack heightened the tensions between Iraq and Kuwait. It
was the Iraq's invasions of Kuwait in 1990 that triggered the Gulf
War in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Meguid told reporters that his five-day visits to the two
countries were part of the effort made by the Arab League to close
inter-Arab ranks.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait split the Arab world. Up to now,
Kuwait has not forgiven Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and his
government. It has called for an official apology for the invasion
by Baghdad to pave the way for Arab reconciliation.

NAIROBI, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's Finance Minister
Simeon Nyachae was out of the cabinet in a government reshuffle
Thursday, for which no reason was given, local sources said here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Nyachae was replaced by Industrial Development Minister
Yekonada Masakhalia.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that Nyachae was resigning from the
government, refusing to take up the post of Industrial Development
Minister offered him in the cabinet reshuffle.
</P>
<P>
At the time of his departure, the sources said, Nyachae was
leading a bid to restore a suspended International Monetary Fund
(IMF) loan.
</P>
<P>
When the IMF suspended the three-year loan of 205 million U.S.
Dollars in 1997, the Kenyan economy declined to a deep recession
and has yet to recover.

According to the sources, the Kenyan Shilling Thursday lost
more than one percent against the U.S. Dollar on the news of
Nyachae's replacement with Industrial Development Minister
Masakhalia.

CAIRO, February 18 (Xinhua) -- More than 50 countries are
expected to attend an international fair due to be held in Cairo
next month, an Egyptian minister said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Trade and Supply Ahmed Gowaili told a press
conference that he has sent invitations to the countries in the
world, 55 of which have expressed readiness to attend the 11-day
fair slated for March 9.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Prime Minister Kamal El-Ganzouri will inaugurate the
Cairo International Fair.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, more than 1,000 Egyptian companies will join with
the Egyptian industries union, chambers of commerce, businessmen
associations and the new industrial cities in the fair.
</P>
<P>
Special seminars will also be held to familiarize foreign
businessmen with facilities and incentives provided for investing
in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has been undertaking economic reforms since 1991 to
privatize state-owned enterprises. It is striving to attract
foreign investments to push forward its economic developments.
</P>
<P>
The first week of the fair will be devoted to businessmen and
the second week will be for the public, Gowaili said.
</P>
<P>
Turkey will hold a trade fair in Cairo in October, the minister
added.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Turkey, which maintain close political and economic
ties, have been negotiating a free trade agreement. And the two
countries are seeking ways to promote bilateral trade and economic
cooperation.

<HEADLINE> UK Retail Sales Rise Strongly in January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON February 18 (Xinhua) - Retail sales in Britain showed
some signs of recovery in January after a disappointing Christmas
for the shops.
</P>
<P>
Latest figures showed retail sales were up 1.1 percent by
volume on December and up 1.2 percent on January 1998. But
economists said this need not stand in the way of further interest
rate cuts.
</P>
<P>
Taking the three months to January, volumes were up only 1.5
percent on the same period of the previous year, the lowest
quarterly increase for almost three years.
</P>
<P>
The figures are unlikely to lessen the demands for the Bank of
England to cut interest rates again in an effort to restore
flagging consumer confidence.
</P>
<P>
The figures from the Office of National Statistics also showed
that household goods sales were up 2.6 percent on the month and a
robust 7.0 percent up on a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
Clothes and shoes also had a good month, with sales up 2.9
percent. Both categories, however, were heavily discounted in the
traditional January sales.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said this and dismal sales in December meant the Bank
would at most delay its interest rate cut program, which has seen
rates cut five times in as many months to 5.5 percent, in a bid to
counter an economic slowdown.

<HEADLINE> 3 Turkish Policemen Wounded in Kurdish Protest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Three policemen were wounded
on Thursday in Kurdish protests against the arrest of the Kurdish
rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan, the semi-official Anatolia News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Supporters of Ocalan, leader of the outlawed Kurdish Workers'
Party (PKK), opened fire at the policemen when the security forces
were trying to disperse a group of demonstrators marching in
Ceyhan town of Adana province, said the agency.
</P>
<P>
The three injured has been sent to hospital with one in serious
condition. And 15 protesters have been arrested.
</P>
<P>
In Istanbul, the country's largest city, protesters set four
buses and two cars on fire late Wednesday. They also smashed the
windows of several other vehicles with stones.
</P>
<P>
The independent Human Rights Association said that about 700
Kurdish activists, mostly members of the pro-Kurdish People's
Democracy Party, have been rounded up in Istanbul and several
southeastern cities.
</P>
<P>
In southeastern province of Batman, police arrested 50 people
after breaking up a protest Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Since Ocalan's capture, pro-Ocalan protesters have tried to
attack diplomatic missions of Israel, the United States, Kenya
and Greece in western Europe.
</P>
<P>
Israeli security guards shot dead three Kurds and wounded 14
others Wednesday as pro-Ocalan protesters attempted to storm the
Israeli consulate general in Berlin, Germany.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan, who led Kurds in a bloody struggle for independence in
southeastern Turkey which claimed over 37,000 lives in more than
14 years, was reportedly detained at the Greek embassy in Kenya,
with the assistance of the U.S. and Israeli intelligence.
</P>
<P>
Both the U.S. and Israel denied their reported involvement.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Rejects Yeltsin's Warning, Ready to Strike Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The White House on Thursday
dismissed Russian President Boris Yeltsin's warning that he would
not let NATO use force against Yugoslavia over the Kosovo
conflict.
</P>
<P>
"We're aware that Russia has opposed the use of force in
Kosovo," White House spokesman David Leavy said.
</P>
<P>
"But we've also made clear that should the Serbs refuse to
comply and refuse to sign a political settlement, that NATO has to
consider military action in its own interests, in the interests of
the region and the interests of the United States and we will do
so," he added.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said in televised comments on Thursday that he had
conveyed to U.S. President Bill Clinton both by phone and by
letter that "this (threatened military strikes against Yugoslavia)
will not work... We will not let you touch Kosovo."
</P>
<P>
Joe Lockhart, the chief White House spokesman, said the United
States was taking "prudent steps to be ready if military force is
needed."
</P>
<P>
According to Russian news agency, Yeltsin had spoken to Clinton
on Wednesday and the Kremlin confirmed the report. But P. J.
Crowley, another White House spokesman, said there had been no
recent communication between the two presidents. He said the last
substantive conversation on Kosovo between the two leaders was
weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
"The Russian position is long held," he said. "What is
confusing us is there has not been a telephone call or written
communication between the two presidents in recent days."
</P>
<P>
Clinton did not respond when asked about Yeltsin's comments as
he left the White House to travel to New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Pentagon officials said they were studying a range
of U.S. and allied strikes, including the possible use of
ship-fired cruise missiles.
</P>
<P>
About 430 NATO strike and support planes -- including 260 U.S.
jets -- are on 40-hour alert for use against Serb targets.
</P>
<P>
Most of the U.S. planes are already in the region. But 51 of
them, including a dozen F-117 stealth fighters, were put on alert
in the United States on Wednesday night and could depart over the
Atlantic on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Defense Secretary William Cohen said the United States
and its allies "want to be in a position to carry out an air
operation, should it be requested."
</P>
<P>
Cohen told reporters on his arrival early this morning in
Seattle from abroad that all the 51 planes would begin arriving in
Europe this weekend, and would be ready for a possible attack by
the middle of the next week.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of sending more warplanes is to heighten the
threat of force and thereby intimidate Yugoslavia into accepting
a six-nation plan for the deployment of NATO peacekeeping troops
in Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Consumer Prices Rise 0.1 Percent in January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 19 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Consumer Price
Index rose a seasonally adjusted 0.1 percent last month following
an increase in December, the Labor Department said Friday.
</P>
<P>
A substantial 0.5 percent rise in January prices charged by
producers such as factories apparently was not passed on to retail
shoppers.
</P>
<P>
In January, consumers paid more for oranges, postage stamps and
cigarettes, but less for pork, clothing and used cars. Thus the
overall inflation keeps mild.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, economists are looking for slightly more
inflation this year -- around a 2.5 percent rate, as compared with
a 12-year low of 1.6 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Energy prices, which plunged 8.8 percent in 1998, probably
won't fall much further, analysts believe. Prices of imported
goods, too, will probably firm as Asian economies begin to recover
from the slump that struck the region since 1997.
</P>
<P>
Last month, energy costs edged 0.2 percent lower. Seasonally
adjusted declines for fuel oil, electricity and natural gas offset
a slight 0.1 percent rise in gasoline.
</P>
<P>
Food prices rose 0.5 percent. Oranges soared 24.1 percent, the
biggest increase in eight years, reflecting a freeze in
California. Prices of fresh fruit jumped 3.7 percent and dairy
products increased 2.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Pork prices, however, fell 1.5 percent, the most in 10 years,
and poultry declined 0.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The core rate of inflation -- which excludes the volatile food
and energy components -- also was up only 0.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Tobacco, which increased 18.5 percent in December, rose 6.6
percent, reflecting a 50-cent-a-pack tax increase in California.
It cost nearly 40 percent more to smoke in January than a year
earlier.
</P>
<P>
Postage increased 3 percent, with the price of a first-class
letter rising from 32 cents to 33 cents. Airline fares rose 1.8
percent and hospital services were up 0.6 percent, the most in 2
and half years.
</P>
<P>
However, hotel and motel bills fell a seasonally adjusted 1.8
percent and used cars and trucks decreased 1.6 percent. Computer
hardware fell 4.4 percent to a level nearly 37 percent cheaper
than a year earlier.

<HEADLINE> Russia, Germany Discuss Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
and Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov met here Friday with German
Federal Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder to discuss bilateral
cooperation and such international issues as Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin told reporters at the end of the meeting that the
consultations Friday once again vindicated the significance of the
continuity and development of bilateral ties to both countries.
</P>
<P>
He said that during his one-on-one meeting with Schroeder, they
discussed "compensation to war veterans who had been in Nazi
concentration camps and involved in forced labor."
</P>
<P>
Schroeder pledged to tackle the problem at the state level,
Yeltsin said.
</P>
<P>
During Schroeder's meeting with Primakov, the two sides
discussed the strengthening of economic and trade cooperation and
encouragement of German investment in Russia.
</P>
<P>
After the talks, Schroeder told reporters that Germany is
prepared to speak for Russia in its talks with international
financial institutions, but Russia must formulate its position in
clear-cut terms.
</P>
<P>
On Kosovo, the two sides "came to the conclusion that the
negotiators in Rambouillet must resolve the Kosovo issue before
the deadline," he said.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder and Primakov also discussed such projects as joint
development of the An-70 transport plane and the construction of a
highway.
</P>
<P>
Shroeder, who arrived here Thursday, has already left here for
home.

<HEADLINE> South China Tiger Gives Birth in Year of Tiger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, February 19 (Xinhua) -- A South China tiger gave birth
to a cub only 15 minutes before the Year of the Tiger ended,
according to Suzhou Zoo in east China's Jiangsu Province.
</P>
<P>
The baby tiger and two other siblings, which were born just
after the Year of the Rabbit started on February 16, are in good
health at present. But Huang Gongqing, the zoo's tiger expert,
explained that it will be 20 days before he can tell their gender.
</P>
<P>
The newly-borns bring the total number of South China tigers in
the country's 19 zoos to 56, which is also believed to be the
total figure for the species alive in the world, since this
particular tiger has not been seen in the wild for more than 20
years.
</P>
<P>
The fairly low birth rate of South China tigers makes them the
world's most endangered animal. Thus experts say these latest
births are vital to the existence of the whole tiger family.
</P>
<P>
"We're monitoring the condition of both the mother tiger and
the cubs around-the-clock," said Gao Yungen, head of the zoo.
</P>
<P>
Suzhou Zoo, which has 16 South China tigers with the newly-
borns, is in the process of establishing a breeding program which
it plans to begin this year.

WASHINGTON, February 19 (Xinhua) -- U.S. F-16 fighter jets

U.S. warplanes attacked Iraqi air defense sites for what they

<HEADLINE> Private Car Purchases on Sharp Rise in Southern City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Private car purchase soared
in south China's Guangzhou city, one of the country's most
economically developed cities, last year with a staggering
increase of 43.34 percent over 1997.
</P>
<P>
The number of private cars grew to 147,200, according to
information gathered by the city's statistics bureau. It
attributed the sharp increase to the growing desire of local
people to own a car, especially since their living standards have
improved dramatically in recent years which has enabled more and
more people to buy cars.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year there were something like 300,900
automobiles in Guangzhou, the capital of Guangdong Province, 48.92
percent owned privately.
</P>
<P>
Such ownership of cars in China is surging and a recent survey
indicated that some 300,000 families across the country are
expected to buy cars in the coming two years while a further three
million are actively considering doing so in the future.
</P>
<P>
Personal demand for cars has risen by an average of 28.1
percent over the past five years, and is expected to hit one
million vehicles annually by the year 2000.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Barter Trade Increases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's barter trade
with its neighbors is on increase.
</P>
<P>
The total value of barter trade in Malaysia increased from
815.5 million ringgit (214.605 million U.S. dollars) in 1996 to
1,216 million ringgit (320 million U.S. dollars) in 1997 and for
January-September 1998, the figure rose sharply to 1.14 billion
ringgit (300 million U.S. dollars), International Trade and
Industry Minister Rafidah Aziz said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Although barter trade was not as large as international trade,
such a trading system increased tremendously, she said during a
visit to Malaysia's first integrated barter trade complex at the
North Port, Port Klang near here.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's barter trading partners are mainly Thailand,
Indonesia and the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
The total value of Malaysia-Thailand barter trade increased
from 536.7 million ringgit (141.24 million U.S. dollars) in 1996
to 741.7 million ringgit (195.18 million U.S. dollars) in 1997 and
for the first nine months last year, the figure stood at 784.1
million ringgit (206.34 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The total value of barter trade between Malaysia and Indonesia
increased to 132.8 million ringgit (34.94 million U.S. dollars) in
1997 from 67.4 million ringgit (17.73 million U.S. dollars) in
1996 and between January and September 1998, the value was
estimated to reach 168.1 million ringgit (44.24 million U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
With the Philippines, Malaysia's barter trade rose from 105.1
million ringgit (27.66 million U.S. dollars) in 1996 to 237.1
million ringgit (62.39 million U.S. dollars) in 1997, and up to
September last year, the barter trade was valued at 90.9 million
ringgit (23.92 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's barter trade with these neighbors involved, among
others, food products, wood products and clothing.
</P>
<P>
According to the Malaysian national news agency Bernama,
Rafidah, looking at the good potential of barter trade in
Malaysia, urged the private sector to open up more barter trade
complex at ports and commercial centers.
</P>
<P>
She said the private sector could expect profitable returns if
they become barter trade entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
Rafidah stressed the development of integrated barter trade
complexes where all government agencies involved in the
enforcement of trade laws and import and export could be located
"to ensure proper management of barter trade".

<HEADLINE> Chelsea Coach Rix Faces Jail for Sex with School Girl </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Chelsea assistant manager and
former England player Graham Rix was told on Friday that he faces
jail after admitting unlawful sex with a 15-year-old schoolgirl.
</P>
<P>
Rix admitted one charge of unlawful sexual intercourse with the
girl in January 1998 and one of indecently assaulting her in
February last year.
</P>
<P>
But the 41-year-old father-of-four denied two further counts of
indecent assault. The not guilty pleas were accepted by the
prosecution and those charges will not be pursued.
</P>
<P>
The case was adjourned until March 26, when full details will
be heard before sentence is passed.
</P>
<P>
Judge Timothy Pontius told Rix: "Because of the gravity of
these offenses, I must keep all my sentencing options open and
they include, perhaps in the forefront, imprisonment. I want you
to be realistic about your position."
</P>
<P>
Rix was released on bail on condition he did not contact the
girl, who cannot be named for legal reasons.
</P>
<P>
Rix, from southwest London, was capped for England 17 times and
is regarded as one of the country's top coaches, working under
Chelsea manager Gianluca Vialli, a former Italian international.
</P>
<P>
He is said to have met the girl at a west London hotel.
</P>
<P>
The maximum sentence for having unlawful sex with a girl under
16 years of age is two years, but for indecent assault it is 10
years.

<HEADLINE> EU Emphasizes Agricultural Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 19 (Xinhua) -- The Common Agricultural
Policy reform was stressed by the European Commission Friday as
the future of the European Union agriculture.
</P>
<P>
The commission, the executive body of the 15-nation European
Union, warned that the union had no other way out but to gear via
reform its common agricultural policy toward expansion and not
contraction.
</P>
<P>
European Agriculture Commissioner Franz Fischler said just
prior to a four-day EU farm ministers council that "the worst
thing is that there is no reform and the second worst thing is
that there is half reform."
</P>
<P>
He said that without reform EU farmers have to prepare for
their main competitors in the next century from intervention
stocks from within their own countries instead of from third-
country markets.
</P>
<P>
The Common Agricultural Policy reform will not affect adversely
the EU farmers nor will it cause a third of the farmers to lose
their way of living as had been suggested by some, said the
commissioner.
</P>
<P>
"The livelihoods of 8 million farm families and many millions
more in the food and agricultural trade industry will be affected
by any decision coming out of the marathon talks next week," said
Fischler.
</P>
<P>
The European council of agriculture ministers are meeting
Monday through Thursday for a four-day meeting. The council
meeting usually lasts two days at the most.
</P>
<P>
Reform on agriculture is key to the implementation of the
political reform program known as the Agenda 2000, in that half of
the European Union annual budget go to the agriculture sector as
subsidies. In 1997, more than 40 billion euros (44.4 billion U.S.
dollars) went to the farming industry in the union.
</P>
<P>
EU member states have been proposed to co-finance the
agricultural sector or to face a degressivity program in farming
subsidies.
</P>
<P>
Some 30,000 farmers, mostly from Italy and Spain, are marching
toward Brussels to protest during next week's council meeting at
the proposed reduction of agricultural subsidies. Some of the
protesters have already reached the outskirts of the Belgian
capital.

<HEADLINE> Situation of Talks on Kosovo is Very Worrying, Says France </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 19 (Xinhua) -- France said Friday that the
situation of the talks on Kosovo in Rambouillet is very worrying
and has asked its nationals to leave the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia immediately.
</P>
<P>
"We are very worried by the situation. We hope that during the
last hours, the two sides could have the courage to make a good
choice," said French Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Anne Gazeau-
Secret.
</P>
<P>
The Serbs have to accept a proposal on political settlement and
a deployment of NATO force in Kosovo by noon Saturday, or they
will face NATO air strikes.
</P>
<P>
The spokeswoman said that she does not have any precise
indication as for what will happen after 12:00 o'clock Saturday
and said that all options remain open.
</P>
<P>
She suggested that French nationals not to go to Yugoslavia now
and those still remaining there leave the country immediately.
</P>
<P>
The French government will also evacuate the non-essential
personnel in the French embassy in Belgrade on Saturday, she said.
</P>
<P>
The spokeswoman expressed support to the mission by U.S.
mediator Christopher Hill to Belgrade on Friday, describing the
visit as "perfectly timely."
</P>
<P>
"All individual action is perfectly timely for accentuating
pressure on Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic," she said,
adding that pressure is also being exerted on Kosovo Albanians to
make them accept the peace plan.
</P>
<P>
The Western countries are also studying the lifting of
sanctions against Yugoslavia at the same time as the Kosovo talks
are going on, said the spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
She said that if a peace deal is struck on Saturday in
Rambouillet, the 15 European Union countries will begin the
procedure of discussing lifting sanctions.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Fiscal 1999 Budget Clears Lower House </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Japan's House of Representatives
(lower house) on Friday approved an 81.86 trillion yen (about 682.
2 billion U.S. dollars) budget for fiscal 1999, which begins on
April 1.
</P>
<P>
After rejecting a motion for amendments by the Democratic Party
of Japan (DPJ), the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and its
coalition partner, the Liberal Party (LD), voted for the budget,
pushing it through the lower house after 19 days of deliberations.
</P>
<P>
The budget was then sent to the House of Councilors, or upper
house, for further deliberations from Monday. Even if the budget
is not approved by the upper chamber of the Diet (parliament), it
will automatically become law on March 20 under the country's
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
Japan's Constitution stipulates that the lower house's vote on
the budget will become the parliament's decision if the upper
house fails to vote on it within 30 days after its acceptance by
the lower house.
</P>
<P>
The fiscal 1999 budget features a 10.5 percent increase in
public works spending, with the intent of putting the sluggish
Japanese economy back on a growth path.
</P>
<P>
It also includes general account expenditures of 46.89 trillion
yen (about 390.7 billion dollars), as well as the issuance of 31.
05 trillion yen (about 258.8 billion dollars) in government bonds
to cover a revenue shortfall resulting from the recession and tax
cuts.

<HEADLINE> Kurds Being Questioned For Occupying Greek Embassy in London </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 19 (Xinhua) -- British police on Friday
continued to question more than 70 Kurdish protesters who were
arrested for occupying the Greek embassy in London.
</P>
<P>
About 73 men and four women were being questioned at two police
stations where they are held under the Prevention of Terrorist Act.
</P>
<P>
But their solicitor said the use of the Act was not correct as
it was not mentioned in the negotiations between police and the
Kurds during the siege.
</P>
<P>
The Kurds were detained because they forced their way into the
Greek Embassy in west London early Tuesday morning to protest the
capture of Abdullah Ocalan, the Kurdish guerrilla chief.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Ocalan was arrested in Kenya on his way from Greek
Embassy in Nairobi to the airport. He was then repatriated to
Turkey, where he was badly wanted for leading a Kurdish guerrilla
force fighting against the Turkish government.
</P>
<P>
The occupation of the Greek Embassy in London ended peacefully
on Thursday afternoon when the Kurds in the mission left the
building and gave themselves up to the police.
</P>
<P>
The Kurds were said to be satisfied that the British government
would seek reassurance about the treatment to Ocalan, who might
face execution in Ankara.

<HEADLINE> Siemens to Double Investment in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Germany's Siemens AG plans to
double investment in its Shanghai mobile phone operations to 600
million yuan (about 72 million U.S. dollars) this year, in an
ambitious bid to win a greater share of China's booming
telecommunications market.
</P>
<P>
The company had already earmarked 300 million yuan investment
this year to boost its joint venture Siemens Shanghai Mobile
Communications Company Ltd (SSMC) and confidently expects a three-
fold increase in its mobile phone and related equipment sales
volume in China by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the move Siemens Shanghai is to beef up its
annual production capacity to 8,000 mobile base stations and three
million handsets this year.
</P>
<P>
SSMC is targeting to sell 3.5 billion yuan (about 422 million U.
S. dollars) worth of mobile base stations and five billion yuan (
about 602 million U.S. dollars) worth of handsets this year.
</P>
<P>
The firm's sales volume reached 2.4 billion yuan (about 289
million U.S. dollars) last year, an increase of 70 percent over
1997, figures which have helped play a significant part in the
increased investment decision.
</P>
<P>
SSMC general manager Peter Borger said that Siemens is
determined to position itself to secure a larger share in China's
telecommunications market, which is experiencing the fastest
growth in the world.
</P>
<P>
He promised that Siemens will inject not only huge amounts of
capital into China but make available the latest technology and
equipment which the company has developed in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The number of mobile phone subscribers in China surpassed 17
million last year. Experts now predict that a further 15 million
more people will take up the use of mobile phones this year.

Industry.
</P>
<P>
A total of 32.69 million color TV sets were manufactured last

worth 27 billion US dollars, despite the fact that the Asian
financial crisis affected the country's total exports.
</P>
<P>
Southern and eastern areas continued to be the leading
producers of electronic products. Guangdong, Jiangsu, Fujian,

<HEADLINE> EU to Start Supplying Food Aid to Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 19 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission said
on Friday that it would start supplying food aid to Russia in the
second half of March, still in time for demand in May and June.
</P>
<P>
A commission official told the press that Thursday's European
Union-Russian Federation summit in Moscow has ironed out the
remaining technical problems affecting the food aid program.
</P>
<P>
He said that the problems came from the Russian side.
</P>
<P>
The official added that the technical problems concerned
delivery and proper control of the food aid and the revenue
generated from the sales of those agriculture products that have
to be sold in Russia instead of being offered free of charge.
</P>
<P>
In a joint press statement signed by Russian President Boris
Yeltsin, EU Presidency holder German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder
and European Commission President Jacques Santer, the EU and
Russia said that the summit had studied the issue of the
implementation of food aid program and ways to use the revenue
generated from sales to address urgent social needs.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the Russian side feared that the EU food supply would
otherwise affect the sales of Russia-produced agriculture products
and resent Polish exporters of agriculture products.
</P>
<P>
The 15-nation bloc and Russia also discussed during the their
one-day meeting how to enhance future cooperation on agriculture
and food production as means of stimulating Russia's economy.

<HEADLINE> S. Korea Seeking More Improvement in Inter-Korean Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, February 19 (Xinhua) -- South Korean President Kim Dae-
jung Friday said the recent proposal by Pyongyang to hold high-
level talks with South Korea showed signs of change in the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK).
</P>
<P>
Pyongyang "suspected (our intentions) at the beginning, but it
has changed little by little and has now come forward, ready to
hold a dialogue at any time," Kim said when he met a group of
lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
The president said he expects that inter-Korean relations will
improve this year more than ever before.
</P>
<P>
Presidential spokesman Park Jie-won said that Kim will push for
a "package deal" on problems involving the DPRK.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the DPRK proposed the political meeting to
discuss ways of preventing a war on the peninsula, promoting
national unification and other issues like the reunion of inter-
Korean separated families.
</P>
<P>
South Korea hailed the proposal and urged the DPRK to arrange
time and place as soon as for the talks without preconditions.
</P>
<P>
At a seminar held Friday to mark the seventh anniversary of the
landmark inter-Korean basic agreement, South Korean Minister for
Unification Kang In-duk said that relations between Seoul and
Pyongyang will improve this year.
</P>
<P>
"There is a high possibility that inter-Korean relations will
break out of a stalemate and head for reconciliation and
cooperation," said the minister.
</P>
<P>
He said his prediction is backed up by international support
for Seoul's engagement policy on Pyongyang and an increase in
inter-Korean exchanges.
</P>
<P>
As a long-term goal, he said, the government will seek to
dismantle the Cold War structure remaining on the Korean peninsula.
</P>
<P>
To this end, Kang said, the government will urge the United
States and Japan to improve relations with the DPRK.
</P>
<P>
Seoul and Pyongyang signed the agreement during a high-level
official meeting in December, 1991, in Seoul.
</P>
<P>
The historic agreement includes the establishment of three sub-
committees on political and military affairs, exchanges and
cooperation and a joint declaration on the denuclearization of the
Korean peninsula.
</P>
<P>
However, researchers attending the seminar said the DPRK is
expected to focus on civilian-level exchanges and economic
cooperation with South Korea this year.

Kiichi Miyazawa that the current exchange rate levels are
basically in line with economic fundamentals, dealers said.

selected issues on the First Section closed at 14,098.04, down 48.

<P>
NANJING, February 19 (Xinhua) -- East China's Jiangsu province
is now tackling a drought in a bid to ensure a regular supply of
water during the holidays.
</P>
<P>
Since last winter, the province has been affected by unusually
warm weather and a shortage of rainfall and so far, more than 330,
000 ha of farmland has been hit by drought.
</P>
<P>
To maintain water supplies, the provincial flood control and
drought-relief headquarters has drawn up a plan to pump water from
the Yangtze River to the northern part of the province which has
suffered the worst effects.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the drought-hit areas have strengthened efforts to
protect crops. Fengxian county, for example, has pumped 50 million
cubic meters of water to irrigate some 20,000 ha of crops.

<HEADLINE> Senior Pakistani Official Praises Sino-Pak Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 19 (Xinhua) -- The visit to Pakistan by
General Chi Haotian, vice chairman of China's Central Military
Commission, will lay the foundation of carrying the close Sino-Pak
relationship into the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
This was stated here Friday by Akram Zaki, chairman of the
Senate's Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, during an
interview with the Associated Press of Pakistan (APP).
</P>
<P>
The visit of General Chi, who is also state councilor and
minister of national defense, is a reflection of "the very close
and time-tested and strategic relationship between China and
Pakistan," Zaki said.
</P>
<P>
Zaki, a former Pakistani ambassador to China, said that General
Chi's visit at this time brings under focus the well-known reality
that the Sino-Pak friendship is a factor of peace and stability in
South Asia and that hegemonism and power politics cannot succeed.
</P>
<P>
China, he said, is a steadfast friend of Pakistan and has
always helped Pakistan to achieve self-reliance and to safeguard
its independence and territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese defense minister's visit is like the homecoming of
a close relative and a dear friend and it will lay the foundation
of carrying China-Pakistan relationship into the 21st century," he
added.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Concerned Over Gulf Situation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan said Friday that it
shared the concern of the international community over the
heightened tension in the Gulf region in the wake of reported
Iraqi statements warning use of force against Kuwait and Saudi
Arabia.
</P>
<P>
A Foreign Office spokesman, responding to a question concerning
renewed Iraqi threats against the two neighbors, stated that
Pakistan is closely monitoring the situation in the region, while
hoping for greater caution and prudence.
</P>
<P>
"The Gulf War of 1991 and its tragic consequences had brought
about unimaginable misery and misfortunes to the region," the
spokesman recalled.
</P>
<P>
"At a time when international community is engaged in efforts
to find ways and means to mitigate those sufferings, any fresh
military adventures would be most unfortunate," he added.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan, the spokesman said, has time and again stressed that
respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty of all states
was the key to peace and stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
"It is our earnest hope that the states in the region will
evolve a regime towards confidence building to overcome the legacy
of the Gulf War," the spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> Largest Ever Media Corps Arrives to Cover Vajpayee's Visit in Pakistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 19 (Xinhua) -- The largest ever contingent
of media arrived in Lahore, the provincial capital of Punjab, to
cover the forthcoming visit by Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari
Vajpayee.
</P>
<P>
A special plane carrying 246 India-based journalists reached
Lahore Friday afternoon. In all, more than 400 journalists, have
started pouring into the city, according to sources from
Pakistan's Information Department (PID).
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee is arriving in Lahore Saturday on an inaugural
trans-border bus for a two-day visit at the invitation of his
Pakistani counterpart Nawaz Sharif. This will be the first visit
to Pakistan by an Indian prime minister in one decade.
</P>
<P>
The magnitude of interest in the peace initiative shown by
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to resolve the outstanding issues with
India is unprecedented, a PID official said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The interest shown by the foreign media in the coverage of the
historic event is quite unusual, said the official.
</P>
<P>
He said the media corps covering the event includes
representatives of the entire range of the international press.
</P>
<P>
Almost all the New Delhi-based foreign journalists, besides
those from the Indian media, have reached by the special plane for
the coverage of Vajpayee's visit.
</P>
<P>
Local journalists as well as the Pakistan-based foreign
correspondents have also been listed in the coverage team.
</P>
<P>
Special security cards have been issued to the newsmen for the
coverage.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, authorities have sealed off Pak-India border at
Wagah, about 22 kilometers east of Lahore, capital of Punjab
province, ahead of Vajpayee's visit with the deployment of a large
contingent of all the law-enforcing agencies.

<HEADLINE> Supermarket Plan to Open on Sabbath Stirs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 19 (Xinhua) -- A Jerusalem supermarket
called Drugstore 2000 is likely to become a new venue for the
heating culture war in Israel Saturday, when it plans to open
business on the Jewish Sabbath.
</P>
<P>
Labor and Social Affairs Minister Eli Yisahi, a member of the
Orthodox religious party Shas, warned the supermarket that it will
violate the law stipulating work time and breach the status quo in
Jerusalem if it opens its door on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
But Yossi Sarid, the leader of the left-wing party Meretz, said
his party members will offer necessary help to ensure the
supermarket will open as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
Police will be deployed around the supermarket to prevent
possible violence between ultra-Orthodox Jews, who strongly oppose
the breach of Sabbath rules, and secular Jews, Israel Radio said.
</P>
<P>
There are about 100 pubs, restaurants, clubs and kiosks
open in Jerusalem on Saturdays, but the Drugstore 2000 will be
the first supermarket to be open on the Sabbath, a holy day
for rest according to Judaism.
</P>
<P>
Clashes often erupt between ultra-Orthodox and secular Jews on
Saturdays. The ultra-Orthodox frequently protest against those
who open business and throw stones at those driving on the
Sabbath.
</P>
<P>
The battle over Sabbath is one of the battlefields in the
prolonged culture war in Israel.
</P>
<P>
The ultra-Orthodox Jews staged a mass prayer rally earlier
this week, the largest in recent history, to protest a series
of Supreme Court rulings which favor civil rights over religious
rules.
</P>
<P>
The secular factions launched a competing demonstration to
show their support for the Supreme Court, protesting against
what they regard as an attempt of the ultra-religious Jews to
seize control of the state power.
</P>
<P>
Ornan Yekutieli, a member of Jerusalem's city council, told
the local daily Haaretz that the opening of the drugstore is
a "suitable Zionist response" to the demonstrations staged by
the ultra-Orthodox against the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
He rejected the argument that the opening of the store is
a breach of the status quo in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
"The secular people in the city have their needs, " he
said, adding that no ultra-Orthodox live in the area where the
supermarket is opening.
</P>
<P>
"They have nothing to do over there," he said, "if they
don't look for trouble they won't find it. If they come
there, so will we."

<HEADLINE> Traditional Medicine Manufacturers Trained in Myanmar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, February 19 (Xinhua) -- The Myanmar health authorities,
in cooperation with the World Health Organization (WTO), is
training traditional medicine manufacturers in the country to
apply good manufacturing practice (GMP) in producing foodstuff
and medicines for its people.
</P>
<P>
The three-day training course, the first of its kind, began
here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Health Major General Ket Sein said at the opening
ceremony of the training course that in the past, traditional
medicine practitioners gave treatment to patients with the use of
self-compounded medicine and formulas for traditional medicine
were handed down by the people from generation to generation and
applied in compounding household medicine.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the importance of quality, safety and efficacy of
traditional medicine which becomes public medicine from household
one.
</P>
<P>
He urged traditional medicine manufacturers to start applying
GMP in the practical field and to follow the issued Traditional
Medicine Law and notifications.
</P>
<P>
He told the manufacturers to make traditional medicine with the
use of genuine traditional raw materials and to refrain from using
Western medicines in making it, warning that if they make them by
mixing Western medicine, they will be given effective punishment
according to the existing law.
</P>
<P>
Attending the course are 63 trainees.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar enacted the Traditional Medicine Law in July 1996 to
uplift the potency of indigenous medicine and to ensure safety for
users, issuing patents and licenses to entrepreneurs and testing
traditional medicines in advanced laboratories.
</P>
<P>
So far, 700 local entrepreneurs have been permitted to produce
and sell their medicinal products.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar has been using traditional medicines since ancient
times which are still popular among people in both urban and rural
areas.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, there were three indigenous
hospitals and 194 dispensaries with more than 400 practitioners in
Myanmar in 1997-98 fiscal year.

<HEADLINE> Fresh Flowers Become Hottest Seller in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Fresh flowers have become the
surprisingly hottest seller during this year's Spring Festival in
Beijing, bringing unexpected profits to flowers dealers and
growers.
</P>
<P>
Xue Zhenqiu, manager of Beijing's famous Huaxiang Flower Market
in Fengtai District, said an average of 10,000 customers have
visited the market each day since the Lunar New Year's eve last
Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Average sales volume stood at 700,000-800,000 yuan (about 84,
000-96,000 U.S. dollars) each day, with the biggest sales volume
exceeding one million yuan," a delighted Xue said.
</P>
<P>
In a change from tradition in previous years flowers have
become hugely popular as gifts despite being relatively expensive
and a range of blooming plants have also been high on people's
gift list during this Spring Festival.
</P>
<P>
People often buy flowers as a new year gift to relatives and
friends, and some flowers are also used to decorate rooms in the
family.
</P>
<P>
Liu Huanyao, manager of a local flower growing garden, said his
3,000 pots of flowers were all sold out before the Spring Festival
with each pot selling at 100 yuan, five times as much as the
original price.
</P>
<P>
Liu also said he has sold 6,000 pots of flowers in the past
month with a sales volume surpassing 200,000 yuan, which equals
half of last year's total sales.
</P>
<P>
Economists say that flowers have become a new, hot economic
growth point for consumers.
</P>
<P>
Beijing now has over 333 ha land for flower growing with more
than 10 flower markets scattered around the city.

<HEADLINE> Kremlin: Yeltsin Did Send Clinton Message on Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 19 (Xinhua) -- The Kremlin said Friday that
President Boris Yeltsin sent a message on Kosovo to his U.S.
counterpart Bill Clinton last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
This is an apparent response to the White House pronouncement
Thursday that there had been no communications between the two
presidents since they attended the funeral of Jordanian King
Hussein early this month.
</P>
<P>
The Interfax news agency, quoting a senior source in the
Kremlin, said Yeltsin reiterated Moscow's support for a political
resolution to the conflict in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"Any attempts to use force against Yugoslavia outside the
framework of the U.N. Security Council must be ruled out," Yeltsin
said in the message.
</P>
<P>
"The Kosovo situation is one of the worst challenges to
international and regional security and stability," the message
said.
</P>
<P>
"We remain convinced that a political solution to the problem
with unconditional respect for Yugoslavia's sovereignty and
territorial integrity is the only possible way to proceed,"
Yeltsin wrote.
</P>
<P>
In live television remarks Thursday, Yeltsin told reporters
that he had conveyed to Clinton both by phone and in writing, that
"this (threatened military strikes against Yugoslavia) will not
work.... We will not let you touch Kosovo."
</P>
<P>
However, the White House dismissed Yeltsin's warning, saying
there had been no recent communication between the two leaders
since they attended the funeral of Jordanian King Hussein on
February 8.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: No Breakthrough Can Be Expected in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Wagah, a border checkpoint
located around 22 kilometers east of Lahore, provincial capital of
Punjab, will become the focus of world attention Saturday when
Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee sets his foot on
Pakistani soil for a two-day visit.
</P>
<P>
This will be a historic moment as Vajpayee is the first Indian
prime minister to visit the rival South Asian neighbor in a
decade, and the visit is of special significance as it is being
undertaken after the nuclear tests by the two South Asian nations
in May last year.
</P>
<P>
Making the inaugural journey of the New Delhi-Lahore bus
service, the first ever trans-border bus service between the two
countries, Vajpayee is visiting Pakistan at the invitation of
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee, who first visited Pakistan in 1979 in the capacity of
Indian foreign minister, is due to cross the Wagah border at 16:00
p.m. local time (11:00 GMT) Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Sharif will greet his Indian counterpart soon after Vajpayee
passes the border. Vajpayee will be extended all the normal
courtesies as a head of government.
</P>
<P>
During Vajpayee's two-day stay in Pakistan, the two prime
ministers will hold one-to-one talks twice, which observers expect
will possibly breed some bold initiatives on the relations between
the two South Asian nations.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here believe that Vajpayee's visit will certainly
provide an important opportunity for talks on bilateral issues
including the core issue of Jammu and Kashmir at the highest
political level.
</P>
<P>
The two prime ministers agreed in their joint statement in New
York last September that an environment of durable peace and
stability was in the supreme national interest of both countries
as well as the region.
</P>
<P>
Pakistani Foreign Minister Sartaj Aziz has expressed the hope
that Vajpayee and Sharif should agree on concrete measures to
build on the commitments contained in their joint statement.
</P>
<P>
The successive nuclear tests, which were products of
intensified rivalry, lent momentum to hope for a negotiated
settlement of the disputes between the two countries who have
fought three wars against each other since their inception in
1947.
</P>
<P>
In the post-nuclear test security environment in the South
Asian region, issues related to peace and security have gained
added significance, Aziz said at a press briefing this week,
adding that "its implications are no longer limited to the region
but extend beyond."
</P>
<P>
Pakistan has taken a number of confidence-building measures,
including resumption of foreign secretary-level talks, unilateral
release of fishermen, New Delhi-Lahore bus service, sale of
electricity, enhanced sports contacts and first ever Indo-Pak
parliamentary conference, to facilitate the dialogue process and
to improve the atmosphere of serious and meaningful negotiations
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here believe that the forthcoming visit by Vajpayee is
a gesture of commitment to solving the outstanding problems. It is
too early to predict that the visit will make any true
breakthrough in resolving the long-standing issues, including the
Jammu and Kashmir dispute.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani government has time and again stressed that the
relations between Pakistan and India will remain strained unless
the core issue of Jammu and Kashmir is resolved.
</P>
<P>
In the forthcoming talks between Sharif and Vajpayee, the
settlement of the Jammu and Kashmir issue, the root cause of
tension and instability in South Asia, is expected to be accorded
the highest priority.
</P>
<P>
According to Aziz, Sharif will once again stress the centrality
of this fundamental issue in the bilateral relationship.
</P>
<P>
However, there is still too big a gap for the two countries to
cover on their respective positions on the disputed area of Jammu
and Kashmir, for which the two countries fought two of the three
wars since 1947.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan repeatedly stresses that the ownership of the area
should be decided through "the exercise by the Kashmiri people of
their inalienable right to self-determination" according to the
relevant U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Only recently, however, India admitted Jammu and Kashmir is "a
disputed area".
</P>
<P>
Pakistan calls for third-party mediation to accelerate the
settlement of the Kashmir dispute which India views as a bilateral
issue.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that neither Sharif nor Vajpayee will take the
risk of being accused of betraying national interest to make a
compromise on Jammu and Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, although there is the possibility that the two prime
ministers take some bold initiatives on improving bilateral
relations, chances are slim for any meaningful progress in the
settlement of the disputes which have entangled the two countries
for 50 years.

BAGHDAD, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Iraq on Friday slammed a
U.S. State Department statement in support of the Turkish

Turkey sent its troops to northern Iraq on Wednesday to track
down rebels of the Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK), which has been
fighting for independence against Ankara since 1984.
</P>
<P>
The PKK sought shelters in northern Iraq's Kurdish autonomous
region in the wake of the 1991 Gulf War, when Baghdad virtually
lost its control over the region. Turkish troops have repeatedly
launched cross-border attacks to wipe out the rebels.
</P>
<P>
While commenting on the latest Turkish move against PKK,
U.S. State Department said on Thursday that it supports the
Turkish government's right to defend itself against terrorists.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi spokesman accused the U.S. of supporting the killing
of Kurds in Turkey and trying to use the Kurdish question in Iraq
as a card of pressure, conspiracy and aggression on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Under the pretext of being keen on the Iraqi Kurds and their
political future, the U.S. is trading with the blood of the
Kurdish people, he added.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led western allies imposed the no-fly zones on Iraq in
the wake of the 1990 Gulf War with a claimed aim of protecting the
Kurds in the north and the Shiite Muslims in the south from
Baghdad's suppression.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Foreign Ministry on Thursday condemned vehemently the
fresh Turkish incursion into northern Iraq and demanded Turkey to
pull back its troops from Iraqi territories immediately.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. pretends to respect international law and human
rights, but it actually tramples down them, said the Iraqi
spokesman.

<HEADLINE> Insurance Replaces Traditional Gifts at Spring Festival </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Pension insurance is becoming
an increasingly popular if rather unusual Spring Festival gift in
east China's Zhejiang Province with young people buying start-up
life policies or pension installments for their parents or elderly
relatives.
</P>
<P>
Since China started its enterprise reform and restructured its
cradle to grave medical system, the government no longer pays for
everything and more and more people have realized the importance
of insurance as both a guarantee of future income and an
investment.
</P>
<P>
An example of this is bank employee Liu Wen, who works for the
Construction Bank of China in the coastal city of Ningbo, prepared
such a special Spring Festival gift for her parents who live in
Jinhua City in the central part of the province.
</P>
<P>
Miss Liu had decided against traditional presents or food
insisting that her parents did not need more food for the Lunar
New Year. "So, I began to think about an alternative gift months
ago," she explained. "Finally a friend helped convince me that
insurance was a very useful gift."
</P>
<P>
Liu went on to add that this year many of her colleagues took
out different kinds of insurance policies for friends and
relatives during the traditional Chinese new year, which fell on
February 16 this year.
</P>
<P>
Even older people have realized the benefits, and Yao Bini, a
Hangzhou resident in her 60s, gave her daughter medical insurance
as a gift for the Spring Festival.
</P>
<P>
"My daughter quit working for a state company four years ago
and began to run her own business," Yao said, "Likewise, she has
to pay for her own medicare. Therefore, I believe medical
insurance is the best gift I can give her so that she doesn't have
to worry about getting sick and not having any financial support."
</P>
<P>
Insurance companies in Hangzhou, capital of Zhejiang Province,
now offer life, accident, medical and pension insurance policies.
And people have been lining up to buy various types during the
Spring Festival, according to reports.

<HEADLINE> Philippine President Rejects Cabinet Revamp Appeal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada Friday brushed aside calls for the resignation or
replacement of his cabinet members, saying he is satisfied with
their performance.
</P>
<P>
The improvements in the economy even amidst the Asian economic
crisis is one vital proof that the cabinet members have been doing
their job well, Estrada told reporters here.
</P>
<P>
"I believe in the probity of my cabinet members. I have the gut
to feel that they are all clean," he added.
</P>
<P>
The president branded as premature calls for Executive
Secretary Ronaldo Zamora to take a leave of absence following a
controversy over a 17 billion peso (440 million U.S. dollars)
power plant rehabilitation contract.
</P>
<P>
Those who claim that the contract was flawed should point out
its specific weakness, instead of conducting a trial of cabinet
members in the media, Estrada said.
</P>
<P>
"Why would he go on a leave of absence when he had nothing to
do with it?" he said.
</P>
<P>
The president also belied speculations that he is planning to
replace Press Secretary Rodolfo Reyes.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Opens Agriculture Sector to Overseas Investors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai, China's largest
industrial and commercial city, plans to announce an additional
300 agricultural projects open to overseas investment in May this
year.
</P>
<P>
The municipality will also announce a series of preferential
policies designed to encourage overseas investment.
</P>
<P>
Related projects will cover four main areas -- the production
of improved strains, raw materials and export products;
manufacturing of farm machinery and equipment; farm produce
processing; and environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai, a city with a population of over 13 million people,
has a great demand for agricultural products, but produces only 50
percent of required pork products, 80 percent of eggs and smaller
amounts of beef and mutton.
</P>
<P>
Rural areas have accelerated efforts to attract investments
from other parts of the world in recent years. Overseas investors
have established over 500 agricultural ventures, with total
contracted capital of close to one billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai will host two international exhibitions focusing on
flowers and animal husbandry techniques later this year as part of
an effort to promote international cooperation in the agriculture
sector.

<HEADLINE> Kosovo Talks Enter Critical Moment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RAMBOUILLET, France, February 19 (Xinhua) -- The Kosovo talks
held by Serbs and Kosovo Albanians have entered a critical moment
as no sign of a breakthrough has appeared 12 hours from the
deadline for the two sides to strike a deal.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. mediator Christopher Hill left here Friday morning for
Belgrade in a last effort to persuade the Yugoslav government to
accept a final version of agreement on a political settlement to
the Kosovo conflict.
</P>
<P>
This is the second time for him to go to Belgrade since Tuesday
in a diplomatic maneuver to pressure the Serbian side to make
concessions.
</P>
<P>
Serbian President Milan Milutinovic also arrived here Friday to
join the Serb delegates in the chateau of Rambouillet, where the
talks have been going on over the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
Milutinovic held talks with the U.S. mediator Thursday evening
in Paris.
</P>
<P>
The two sides differ over the arrangement for bringing peace to
the Serbian province in Yugoslavia, as the Serbs reject a
deployment of foreign forces, as the Albanians have insisted upon.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also dispute over the future of the province.
Belgrade insists that Kosovo must remain a part of Serbia, while
Albanians want to hold a referendum after a three-year interim
period.
</P>
<P>
British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook, who is the co-chairman of
the talks with French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine, will also
arrive here Friday in a last attempt to bring about an agreement.
</P>
<P>
In a statement addressed to the Yugoslav media on Thursday,
Cook and Vedrine urged the Serbs to accept the version of
agreement drafted by the six-nation Contact Group and to agree to
the deployment of NATO forces in Kosovo for peacekeeping purposes.
</P>
<P>
But the Yugoslav government described it as "an ultimatum" and
has rejected it.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who will also be
here on Saturday, has warned Yugoslav President Milosevic that the
NATO would "strike hard" if the Rambouillet talks fail.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian Opposition Leader to Sue Newspaper for Defamation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's opposition
leader and Democratic Action Party (DAP) Secretary General Lim Kit
Siang is set to sue Utusan Malaysia, a leading national daily, for
defamation.
</P>
<P>
Lim said in a statement here Friday he had authorized his
lawyers to file a defamation suit for between 200 million ringgit
(52.631 million U.S. dollars) and 300 million ringgit (78.947
million U.S. dollars) against the newspaper next Tuesday for its
news report last Saturday alleging that he (Lim) was unpatriotic.
</P>
<P>
The final figure would be settled by early next week, Lim said,
adding in deciding on the range of defamation damages he should
seek from Utusan Malaysia, his lawyers and he took into account
two recent defamation suits -- the first by Mirzan Mahathir, son
of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, who sued the printers of Asian
Wall Street Journal - Star Papyrus, a subsidiary of Star
Publications, for 150 million ringgit (39.473 million U.S.
dollars) and the second by Berjaya Group Chairman and Chief
Executive Vincent Tan who sued Star Papyrus for 200 million
ringgit (52.631 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Lim said his lawyers had also prepared another 200
million ringgit to 300 million ringgit defamation suit against
Deputy Home Minister Abdul Kadir Sheikh Fadzir for Kadir's
statement against him regarding prison conditions for his son Lim
Guan Eng.
</P>
<P>
The opposition leader said he had instructed his lawyers to
hold onto the suit as he wanted to give the deputy minister a
chance to clarify that he was misled with facts and data about
prison conditions.
</P>
<P>
Lim said he would instruct his lawyers to file the suit against
Abdul Kadir if he was not prepared to retract the allegations he
had made against him.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Australian Foreign Minister
Alexander Downer has pledged Australia's help to East Timor
regardless of whether it chooses independence Friday ahead of his
visit to Indonesia to discuss the future of the disputed province.
</P>
<P>
Downer said Australia would accept and support a fully
independent East Timor if that is what the people of East Timor
wanted.
</P>
<P>
"Because it's not us, or Indonesia, who in the medium term are
going to decide the fate of East Timor. It's the East Timorese,"
Downer told ABC TV's Lateline program early Friday.
</P>
<P>
"Either way we'll be giving them help whether they adopt the
autonomy package or whether they go down the path of
independence," he said.
</P>
<P>
Downer said it would cost at least 50 million U.S. dollars in
aid just to maintain East Timor's current low standard of living
if it broke with Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Downer revealed he has already begun talks with Portugal, Japan
and the European Union on assistance for East Timor.
</P>
<P>
Downer leaves Australia Sunday for a week of meetings in Bali,
Jakarta and Portugal. In Jakarta, Downer will meet with President
B.J. Habibie, senior opposition figures and jailed Fretilin
resistance leader Xanana Gusmao.
</P>
<P>
Downer then travels to Portugal where he will also discuss the
future of East Timor.

<HEADLINE> Joint Forum Releases Final Documents on Financial Conglomerates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, February 19 (Xinhua) -- A joint forum consisting of the
world's leading supervising organizations in banking, securities
and insurance has called on its members to implement the
principles set out in the final documents made public in the Swiss
city of Basle on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The matters dealt with in the papers, prepared by the Basle
Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS), the International
Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) and the
International Association of Insurance Supervisors (IAIS), include:
</P>
<P>
-- Techniques for assessing the capital adequacy of
conglomerates including detecting excessive gearing;
</P>
<P>
-- Facilitating the exchange of information among supervisors;
</P>
<P>
-- Coordination among supervisors;
</P>
<P>
-- Testing the fitness and propriety of managers, directors and
major shareholders of conglomerates.
</P>
<P>
"The papers are a significant step toward in addressing some of
the most important supervisory issues that arise from the
continuing emergence of financial conglomerates and the blurring
of distinctions between the activities of firms in each of the
banking, securities and insurance sectors", said the Basle-based
Bank for International Settlements in a press release.
</P>
<P>
The Joint Forum on Financial Conglomerates was established in
early 1996 under the aegis of the BCBS, the IOSCO and the IAIS.
</P>

Australia, Belgium, Canada, France,Germany, Italy, Japan,

<HEADLINE> UK Education System Racist, Ouseley Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Britain's education system was
"institutionally racist," Chairman of the Commission for Racial
Equality, Herman Ouseley, said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Herman told The Times Educational Supplement (TES) "
institutional racism" was "an inherent part of the education
system." He was referring to the disproportionate level of under-
achievement by black children in schools.
</P>
<P>
The commission defined institutional racism to mean that the
practices and procedures or methods of working of an institution
would have a worse impact on one ethnic group than another,
whether or not that impact was intended.
</P>
<P>
He said: "Why is it that after almost 40 years of analyzing
and campaigning about this, so many black children are still under-
achieving; that there are so few ethnic minority teachers; that
bodies like Ofsted are so lacking in ethnic minority input?"
</P>
<P>
"Many organizations have good intentions and excellent paper
policies and many individuals try very hard, but the end result is
still the same," he added.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show no difference between the levels of attainment
with which black and white children start school. But a gap widens
by secondary school.
</P>
<P>
Black young men are three times as likely to be permanently
excluded from school than their white counterparts - in some areas,
the figure is as high as 15 percent.

<HEADLINE> Former World Champion Dropped by Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, February 19 (Xinhua) - Former Chinese world champion He
Zhili, who is now known as Chire Koyama, has failed to made the
Japanese national team for the 45th world championships to be held
from April 26 in Belgrade, Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese table tennis association, which announced 14
members for Belgrade Thursday, said it was a decision to "
rejuvenate" the national team.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time that Koyama, now 34, was dropped from the
national squad since she was naturalized as a Japanese citizen in
1992 and became the national champion for six straight years.
</P>
<P>
"I cannot understand why I was dropped. I was third in the
Asian championships. It seems that they do not want to win the
world championships," Koyama was quoted as saying by Nikkan Sports
daily.
</P>
<P>
"I would understand if my results were no good. It will cause a
big problem," added Koyama, whose only chance for the Sydney
Olympic Games will be to compete in other international events to
keep her ranking of 15th.
</P>
<P>
The top 20 players after the world championships will be
automatically eligible for the Olympics, but only two from the
same country can go to Sydney.
</P>
<P>
Koyama, the 1987 world champion from China under her maiden
name of He Zhili and married her Japanese coach in 1991 before
getting Japanese nationality. She beat then world number one Deng
Yaping to win the 1994 Asian Games.
</P>
<P>
Koyama won back the Asian championships in 1996, but her
struggles started soon afterwards. She has been on the verge of
divorce, living apart from her Japanese husband for more than a
year.
</P>
<P>
Koyama has said her husband, Hideyuki, has had a mistress since
before the Atlanta Olympics and she has sued for divorce,
consolation money and five million yen (42,000 dollars) she lent
to one of his relatives.
</P>
<P>
Koyama skipped the Bangkok Asian Games in December due to an
injury and failed to defend the national championships.
</P>
<P>
The national team for Belgrade, however, included another
former Chinese Seiko Iseki, 36, better known as the Seoul Olympic
doubles champion Wei Qingguang, who won the national title in
December for a second year running.

<HEADLINE> Seoul Sets 1999 Target for Agricultural Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, February 19 (Xinhua) -- The South Korean government
Friday announced that it has set the 1999 export target for
agriculture, livestock and forestry products at two billion U.S.
dollars this year, up 17.6 percent from last year's 1.7 billion U.
S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
To reach the target, South Korea will foster 10 major export
items and intensify its export promotion activities on the
Japanese market, which accounts for 45 percent of South Korea's
export of agricultural products, Minister of Agriculture and
Forestry Kim Sung-hoon said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has set the 1999 export target at 350 million U.S.
dollars for pork, 14 million U.S. dollars for flowers, 50 million
for kimchi (traditional Korean food), 105 million U.S. dollars for
ginseng, and 145 million U.S. dollars for forestry goods.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the country, whose economy has began recovery, will
strengthen overseas market exploration activities further this
year to increase exports through holding international exhibitions
for South Korean-made agricultural goods and special sales
promotion events this year both at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
The ministry also disclosed that South Korea will invest 45
trillion won (38.1 billion U.S. dollars) for its second-phase
agricultural-related investment and finance projects within the
coming six years.
</P>
<P>
Along with this, the ministry will push ahead with merging the
four organizations -- the National Agricultural Cooperatives
Federation, the National Livestock Cooperatives Federation, the
National Forestry Cooperatives Federation, and the National
Ginseng Cooperatives Federation -- to improve external competitive
power.
</P>
<P>
Over the first-phase agricultural investment and finance
projects in 1992-1998, the government spent 42 trillion won for
the restructuring of distribution system, the creation of
environmentally-friendly agriculture, an export increase, and
management renovation.

<HEADLINE> Estrada: No Compromise in Securing General's Release </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada said here Friday that there would be no compromise in
securing the release of Brig. Gen. Victor Obillo and Capt. Eduardo
Montealto, who were abducted by an anti-government group.
</P>
<P>
"I'm not threatening anybody but I think the government should
not compromise with anyone," Estrada told reporters in the
presidential palace.
</P>
<P>
Obillo, along with Montealto, their driver and a civilian were
abducted by members of the New People's Army Wednesday night in
Davao City while inspecting government projects. The rebels
released the driver and the civilians later.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the incident will jeopardize peace talks with the
anti-government group, Estrada said:" I don't think so, because
this is an isolated case. Perhaps within this week they will
release Obillo and the captain, but it's up to them. If something
untoward happens there, I think we will again test each other's
wills."
</P>
<P>
He also said that the incident will not affect his plans to
visit Mindanao next week.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Brig. Gen. Antonio C. Santos, deputy commander for
operations in the Southern Philippines ruled out any possible
swap, as demanded by the New People's Army, of Obillo and
Montealto with a rebel commander, who was responsible for the
massacre of 30 people in Digos, Davao del Sur in 1989.
</P>
<P>
The rebel commander is now in jail after he was captured last
year.

<P>
GENEVA, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Olympic champion Mika Myllylae
of Finland powered through a snow storm to win the men's 30-
kilometer freestyle race Friday and capture the first gold medal
of the Nordic Ski World Championship in Ramsau of Austria.
</P>
<P>
Myllylae, 29, set a punishing pace from the start and led at
all intermediate timing stations.
</P>
<P>
He kept increasing his lead throughout the race and won in one
hour, 15 minutes, 26.2 seconds, 35.3 seconds ahead of Thomas
Alsgaard of Norway.
</P>
<P>
Norwegian superstar Bjorn Daehlie struggled over the last few
kilometers and had to settle for the bronze medal, 7.2 seconds
behind Alsgaard, who overtook his teammate late in the race.
</P>
<P>
Fulvio Valbusa of Italy, who had spent part of the race behind
Myllylae and at one point was ahead of Daehlie, faded in the late
stages and finished fourth. But Daehlie was unable to take
advantage of Valbusa's problems and instead of moving to second
place, allowed Alsgaard to break through.

<HEADLINE> Gallup-China: Thriving Through Odds (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 19 (Xinhua) -- "Gallup poll," which may well
be a household word in the United States, is thriving in China
while going through odds in an economy yet to become fully market-
oriented.
</P>
<P>
In the United States, Gallup is reputed for the accuracy of its
predictions, most notably predictions of important events like
election results. Its Chinese branch, however, has restricted to
commercial operations since its founding in 1993 as the first
foreign company licensed in China for market research.
</P>
<P>
Market surveys and analysis and business consulting are Gallup-
China's main business operations. "To suit local conditions,
Gallup's motto 'let people's voice be heard' is modified to 'let
the Chinese consumer's voice be heard,'" says Fang Xiaoguang,
Gallup-China's vice-chairman.
</P>
<P>
In 1995 and 1997, Gallup-China conducted separate surveys of
the changes that have taken place nationwide under the ongoing
economic reforms in various aspects of Chinese life. Publication
of the second survey results coincided with President Jiang Zemin'
s visit to the United States. The president was said to be pleased.
</P>
<P>
The company conducts nationwide surveys biannually with three
operational centers in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou,
respectively. The main office in Beijing has about 40 employees
headed by eight in-house senior analysts.
</P>
<P>
According to Wu Zuodong, director of the Field Work section of
the Beijing office, local associates are from all walks of life,
but the majority of them are university teachers and students.
</P>
<P>
"Teachers and students usually have a better understanding of
the missions and the questions. The students, in particular, are
imbued with a pioneering spirit and have more time to spare for
work with us," Wu says.
</P>
<P>
Chai Liangwen, a third-year student at the Guangdong
Polytechnic Institute, says he likes working for Gallup-China
because that provides him with opportunities to meet all sorts of
people.
</P>
<P>
"Conducting interview is no easy job," Wu comments. "It is
especially so in cities where many people shut themselves behind
burglary-proof iron bars and do not welcome unexpected visitors."

<HEADLINE> Gallup-China: Thriving Through Odds (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Besides home calls, Gallup-China is trying telephone interviews,
but normally half of the requests for the interviews are declined.
Fang believes it's still too early for his company too do surveys
through Internet, thinking that frequent web visitors in China are
a peculiar, biased minority.
</P>
<P>
Fang revealed that Gallup-China's clients are mostly
multinational companies with relatively few Chinese customers. "It
takes time for Chinese companies to learn the importance of market
surveys and to recognize the competence of a prestigious foreign
company like us," Fang says.
</P>
<P>
Financial difficulties on the part of China's state-owned
enterprises may also be a reason. Many such enterprises are losing
money, unable even to pay their own employees.
</P>
<P>
Fang admits that his company does charge more than its Chinese
rivals. "In following the Gallup tradition, we won't cut prices to
lure customers," he says. "Quality service, after all, is the most
powerful weapon in any business war."
</P>
<P>
Gallup had few Chinese competitors in the early days. Now the
latest official statistics show the country has around 1,000
agencies involved in businesses like consulting and market surveys.
</P>
<P>
According to Fang, Gallup-China's business turnover has been
rising year after year. But he refuses to be over-optimistic in
terms of the impact of the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
"Meanwhile," he says, "there is no need to be pessimistic.
Investors with enough farsightedness are not to be scared off."
</P>
<P>
Fang is confident of a new boom of the Chinese economy over the
next five years. "That would usher in new opportunities for Gallup-
China," he says.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Continues to Fight Hunger, Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam has mobilized 10,000
billion Vietnamese dong (about 714 million U.S. dollars to help
quicken the implementation of the national program to eliminate
hunger and alleviate poverty in the next two years, the country's
English daily Vietnam News reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The money was gathered from state, provincial and municipal
budgets, international agencies and a variety of economic sectors,
a two-day conference to reduce Vietnam's hungry and poor families
held here was told.
</P>
<P>
It will be used to build infrastructure, re-distribute
population, promote production and jobs, develop education and
public health, train poor farmers in new skills including forestry
and fishing.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam also plans to reduce the number of hungry and poor
families from 17 percent to 10 percent by the year 2000, according
to the meeting held by Vietnam's finance, health and labor, war
invalids and social affairs ministries.
</P>
<P>
The program launched in 1992 has helped reduce the number of
hungry and poor families from 3.8 million -- about 20 million men,
women and children -- to 2.4 million, or about 12.5 million
people.
</P>
<P>
About 18,000 billion Vietnamese dong (about 1.3 billion
dollars) -- or about 16 percent of Vietnam's government funds --
has been spent on the program since it started.
</P>
<P>
As a result, 15 cities and provinces have a hunger-poverty rate
of less than 10 percent, while in 21 provinces it is between 11
and 19 percent.

<P>
PARIS, February 19 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading French newspapers on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- While Ankara hardened its repression against the pro-Kurdish
militants, demonstrations continued on Thursday across Europe on
the third consecutive day denouncing the arrest of Abdullah Ocalan.
Ocalan will be questioned by prosecutors of a security court on
the island of Imrali in the sea of Marmara on Friday, and the
condition for his trial remain a concern for Europeans.
</P>
<P>
-- The conference on Kosovo held in Rambouillet has entered a
critical stage with an uncertain outcome. The Serb and Albanian
delegations to the peace talks were given on Thursday a final
version of a political agreement which they were urged to adopt
before Saturday, said the three international mediators.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- Two days before the end of the talks in Rambouillet on
Kosovo, the Western countries have accentuated their pressure on
the Serbs. The U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said on
Thursday that she had warned Serb President Slobodan Milosevic
that NATO would "strike hard" if an agreement was not reached.
NATO Secretary General Javier Solana said that NATO forces would
act rapidly in case of a failure of the talks.
</P>
<P>
-- French President Jacques Chirac will be received on Friday
by U.S. President Bill Clinton at the White House. Although the
two heads of state keep a good personal relationship, the
differences between Paris and Washington over a series of issues,
including Kosovo, Iraq, and the new international monetary order,
are expected to come up in their talks.

<HEADLINE> Nigerians to Vote in National Assembly Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Nigerians will file out to
polling stations all over the country on Saturday to elect their
representatives to the National Assembly or parliament in the
forthcoming democratic elections.
</P>
<P>
A total of 360 House of Representatives members and 109
senators will be elected in Saturday's poll which is the second to
the last in the series of elections to be held under the current
transition program in the most populous African country.
</P>
<P>
The Provisional Ruling Council, the country's highest ruling
body, has approved two decrees which would govern the National
Assembly and presidential elections to be held on February 20 and
27 respectively.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian Head of State General Abudulsalami Abubakar has signed
the two decrees into law which would put a seal of legitimacy on
Saturday's National Assembly election and the forthcoming
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Speaking Thursday during his two-day visit to Benue State, east
Nigeria, General Abubakar stressed the need for Nigerians to
participate in the transition program fully so that "together we
will lay a solid foundation for enduring democracy as well as
economic regeneration for our beloved country."
</P>
<P>
The Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission
(INEC), Justice Ephraim Akpata, assured Thursday that the
commission had done every thing to ensure a hitch-free National
Assembly elections on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The electoral commission said that the date of the presidential
election remained February 27, apparently reacting to the demand
made by the alliance of the All People's Party (APP) and the
Alliance for Democracy (AD) for a change in date.
</P>
<P>
Local and state elections have already been held in the West
African country under Abubakar's transition program with the
turnout being about half the more than 40 million registered
voters in the country.
</P>
<P>
In the local and state elections, the dominant People's
Democratic Party (PDP) won more than 50 percent of the votes cast
and Saturday's election is a key test before the February 27
presidential election for the PDP as its presidential candidate
former Head of State General Olusegun Obasanjo is trying to regain
power after 20 years.

<HEADLINE> D-8 Summit to Tackle World Challenges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 19 (Xinhua) -- The upcoming summit of the
Islamic Developing Group of Eight, or D-8, will focus on
challenges posed by the new world economic order to the group,
said an Egyptian official.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Assistant Foreign Minister Sayyed Kassem el-Masri made
the remarks on Thursday before the second D-8 summit is to open in
Dacca, Bangladesh, on March 1, the Egyptian Gazette newspaper
reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The summit is expected to adopt 10 resolutions on encouraging
and pushing forward cooperation among member states in trade,
finance, banking, technology, agriculture, telecommunications and
health, el-Masri said.
</P>
<P>
Foreign ministers of the group will hold a meeting in Dacca to
prepare the summit agenda. El-Masri will head Egypt's delegation
to the foreign ministers' meeting due for next Thursday, the
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
After the summit, Egypt will host a meeting of the group's
expert committee in April to tackle an Egyptian feasibility study
on setting up a company for promoting products of the D-8 states
in world markets, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The D-8, established in October, 1996, comprises eight Muslim
countries of Bangladesh, Egypt, Indonesia, Iran, Malaysia,
Nigeria, Pakistan and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The group, also called the "Muslim-8," is aimed at enhancing
cooperation in the political, trade and economic fields among its
members.
</P>
<P>
The group also intends to improve the status of developing

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia said Friday that
Myanmar should not be excluded from the ASEAN-EU (European Union)
meeting in Berlin next month.
</P>
<P>
The question of leaving out Myanmar did not arise as Myanmar is

Foreign Minister Syed Hamid Albar told a press conference here
while asked to comment on news reports that the EU had refused to
allow Myanmar officials to attend the upcoming Berlin meeting.
</P>
<P>
"This is an ASEAN-EU meeting. Myanmar is part of ASEAN. We are
not arranging a separate meeting between countries in ASEAN and
Europe," Syed Hamid said.
</P>
<P>
To a question, the minister said that at the moment Malaysia
had no plans to boycott the meeting over the issue but would abide
by any decision taken by ASEAN.
</P>
<P>
"We (ASEAN) always act by consensus. Whatever decision taken by
ASEAN, we will abide by it ... but we should look at the positive
and optimistic side," he said.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas was quoted as saying in
Jakarta Thursday that ASEAN would cancel talks with the EU if the
row over Myanmar was not resolved.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar joined ASEAN in July, 1997, which also groups Brunei,
Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand
and Vietnam.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Stock Market Shows Downward Trend </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, February 19 (Xinhua) -- The Cyprus stock market
managed to take a breather during the past week, after an
astounding performance it witnessed from February 5 to 11, a
weekly market review said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The review, issued by the Cyprus Investment and Securities
Corporation Limited (CISCO), said the market experienced a rather
steep decline, shedding 8.5 percent over three consecutive days
since it registered an all-time high of 622.2 points last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
However, it saw a steady turnaround over the following two
sessions.
</P>
<P>
On a weekly basis the market exhibited a drop of 40.8 points or
6.6 percent. The CISCO All-Share Index closed at 581.4 points on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Volume of transactions also experienced a gradual decline
during the week and the astonishing daily level of 16.7 million
Cyprus pounds (33.4 million U.S. dollars) recorded on February 11
was not repeated.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the average daily volume for this week remained
at a very high level of about 8 million pounds (16 million
dollars), with the weekly total rising to around 40 million pounds
(80 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
Total volume of transactions for the last 5 trading sessions
reached to 39.9 million pounds (79.8 million dollars), compared to
42.3 million pounds (84.6 million dollars) in the previous week.
</P>
<P>
The average daily volume this week fell to 8 million pounds
(16 million dollars) from 8.5 million pounds (17 million dollars)
in the previous week.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Issues Euro Debt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon has successfully
launched the Middle East's first debt in euro this week, the Daily
Star reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The issue involved 300 million U.S. dollars in euros and 200
million dollars in dollars with the marketed coupon values of 7.25
percent on the euro and 8.5 percent on the dollar.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese government had intended to issue the debt in two
sections with 200 million dollars in dollars and 100 million
dollars in euros.
</P>
<P>
However, the euro element was increased to 300 million dollars
due to high demand for the euros and positive confidence in the
European currency, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The issue, which was marketed by French financial group
Merrill Lynch, attracted investors from major institutions, the
Lebanese diaspora, European investors and Lebanese banks.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon launched the Middle East's first eurobond in 1994 and
currently holds around 2.5 billion dollars outstanding. All were
in dollars except for a five-year 250 million mark bond launched
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the parliament endorsed a foreign borrowing plan
submitted by previous government to issue a total of 2 billion
dollars, of which 1.6 billion dollars eurobonds were issued in the
same year.
</P>
<P>
The plan was designed to replace high-yield debts in Lebanese
currency, principally Treasury bills, with lower-yield,
longer-maturing debt in foreign currencies.
</P>
<P>
Around 75 percent of the 18 billion national debt is financed
by Lebanese pound treasury bills with an average yield of 14
percent.

<HEADLINE> Australia Marks 57th Anniversary of Japanese Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Australia's coastal city of
Darwin Friday remembered the day when its shores were hit by bombs
from hundreds of Japanese planes during the World War II, the
Australian Broadcasting Corporation reported.
</P>
<P>
The massive two-wave air raid on Darwin, the country's
northernmost city and capital of the Northern Territory, on
February 19, 1942 was by far the biggest attack on an Australian
city during which 243 people died, about 300 were injured. Eight
ships, including six big ones, were sunk in Darwin Harbor.
</P>
<P>
During the next two years Darwin was hit by 64 air raids but
none were as big as the first one.
</P>
<P>
In the Northern Territory parliament Friday, about 400 people
came to remember Australia's Pearl Harbor.
</P>
<P>
Parliament stands where the Darwin post office was destroyed in
the raid that killed 10 people including the postmaster, his wife
and his daughter.
</P>
<P>
One of those, 77-year-old master builder Les Semken who came
all the way from Sydney remembered as a 20-year-old carpenter at
the naval barracks seeing hundreds of planes high over Darwin, the
Australian Associated Press reported.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus to Abolish Death Penalty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, February 19 (Xinhua) -- The Cyprus House of
Representatives Thursday night unanimously passed a bill
abolishing the death penalty in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
However, treason in the military in time of war remains a
capital offence, the Cyprus Mail newspaper reported here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The death penalty could, before Thursday's vote, still be
imposed for convictions for high treason and piracy.
</P>
<P>
The last time the death penalty was used in Cyprus was
in 1963, when a man was hanged for murder.
</P>
<P>
The abolition of the death penalty brings Cyprus into line
with the 6th Protocol of the European Human Rights Convention.
</P>
<P>
Under the bill, the age of criminal liability was raised from
seven to 10 years of age.

<HEADLINE> Air Lanka's Native Pilots Strike Against Unfair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan pilots working in
the national carrier Air Lanka went on strike Friday morning
against a decision taken by Emirates authorities to grant more pay
to foreign pilots.
</P>
<P>
Due to the strike the scheduled flights to Paris UL 563,
Frankfurt UL 557 and Singapore UL 312 did not take off this
morning, Air Lanka sources said.
</P>
<P>
The conflict has arisen due to a scheme to increase foreign
pilots' salary by 1,300 U.S. dollars and Sri Lankan pilots' salary
by a small margin.
</P>
<P>
There are 100 Sri Lankan pilots and 25 foreign pilots serving
in Air Lanka at present. Foreign pilots earn around 7,000 dollars
a month while Sri Lankan pilots get only one third of it.
</P>
<P>
Last April, the United Arab Emirates Airlines purchased 40
percent stake of Air Lanka, and therefore has three seats in the
Air Lanka's seven-member board of directors.
</P>
<P>
Air Lanka sources said that an attempt made by the pilots to
meet Air Lanka's Chief Executive Officer Andrew Grey failed
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lankan Pilots' Guild has decided to seek advice from the
International Pilots Guild on this issue, the sources said.

<HEADLINE> S. Lebanon Annexation a Technical Adjustment, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Amid Lebanese government's
strong protest over alleged Israeli expansion of the occupied
zone in south Lebanon, the Jewish state has explained that the
act is only a "technical adjustment."
</P>
<P>
The Israeli Army said in a statement released by its ally
South Lebanon Army(SLA) on Thursday the arrangements around
Arnoun is only a technical adjustment, not an expansion of
the zone, the Daily Star reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday night, a joint group of Israeli forces and SLA
militia entered the village of Arnoun, which lies just outside
the Israeli occupied zone, laid down barbed wire and land mines
around the village and set up a checkpoint to supervise traffic
in and out of the village.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli army also said in the statement that the village
had been seized "to protect its residents" from attacks by the
resistance and prevent Hezbollah terrorists' activities.
</P>
<P>
With no more than 70 residents, Arnoun is near the Israeli
strongest redoubt in Beaufort Castle, a crusader fortress, and is
reported to be always used by Hezbollah guerrillas as operations
pad.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, is leading a
guerrilla war trying to oust Israeli forces and SLA militia
out of south Lebanon where Israel set up a self-styled
security zone in 1985 to allegedly protect its north from
Lebanese guerrillas' attacks.
</P>
<P>
In response, Lebanese Prime Minister Salim Hoss swiftly sent
a letter to the United Nations's Secretary-General Kofi Annan
protesting the "Israeli new aggression on Lebanon."

<HEADLINE> IIPA Wants U.A.E. Off U.S. Watch List </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, February 19 (Xinhua) -- The International
Intellectual Property Alliance (IIPA) has recommended to the
U.S. that the U.A.E be removed from the priority Special 301
watch list because of its great progress in reducing piracy
levels.
</P>
<P>
According to a report by Gulf News on Friday, IIPA suggested to
the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) that the U.A.E.'s progress be
recognized.
</P>
<P>
The U.A.E. has succeeded in reducing piracy levels to 54
percent in 1998 -- almost equal to the European rate, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
IIPA suggested that the U.A.E. be downgraded in April to
the "other observation" status which is a prior stage to total
removal from the USTR list.
</P>
<P>
The USTR list is divided into Priority Foreign Country,
Priority Watch List, "other observation" status and "on recommendation
" status.
</P>
<P>
Piracy rate in the U.A.E. was 60 percent in 1997, the lowest
in the region.
</P>
<P>
The global estimate by IIPA of trade losses due to piracy
show that losses in the U.A.E. dropped to 22.4 million U.S.
dollars in 1998 from 27.4 million dollars in 1997.
</P>
<P>
"This is excellent news for the U.A.E. and thoroughly
justifies all of the government's extensive efforts in fighting
copyright piracy," said Ashok Sharma, Middle East Business
Software Alliance director.
</P>
<P>
"The initial analysis of 1997-98 levels of piracy suggests
its piracy rate for business applications will fall yet again
from 60 percent to 54 percent," he added.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, IIPA recommended that Israel be
put on the highest level as a Priority Foreign Country, while
Kuwit, which has no copyright law, be put on the Priority
Watch List if it fails to draft laws by April 30.
</P>
<P>
Countries on the watch list include Bahrain, Egypt, India,
Jordan, Lebanon, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Palestinian Authority
and Pakistan.

<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Various programs including
the ban of advertisement of tobacco and alcohol products in the
electronic media were scheduled for Friday throughout Nepal to
mark the 49th National Democracy Day.
</P>
<P>
Crown Prince Dipendra and Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala
attended a special function held in the capital of Kathmandu.
</P>
<P>
An amnesty was offered to the inmates at various jails in the
Himalayan kingdom, the official RSS news agency said.
</P>
<P>
Late King Tribhuvan announced the establishment of democracy in
the country on February 18, 1951 after the 104-year family rule of
the Ranas was overthrown.
</P>
<P>
In January 1961, King Mahendra imposed a ban on political
parties and in December 1962, and introduced a new constitution
providing for a partyless Panchayat system in the country.
</P>
<P>
A mass movement in early 1990 forced King Birendra to restore
the multi-party democracy under a constitutional monarchy later
that year.
</P>
<P>
The country is now bracing for an election to the House of
Representatives, the third since 1990, on May 3 this year.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Geologists to Recover Ice Cores from Mt. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 19 (Xinhua) -- A group of United States
 geologists have requested the Tanzanian government to allow them
to recover ice cores from Mount Kilimanjaro, the highest peak in
Africa, for scientific research.
</P>
<P>
Prof. Lonnie Thomson of the Geological Science Department at
the Ohio State University, predicted that the glaciers at the top
of the mountain may disappear in 30 years due to global warming.
</P>
<P>
Meeting with the Kilimanjaro Regional Commissioner Philemon
Sarungi Thursday, Thomson said the ice fields on the mountain in
north Tanzania represent the only place in Africa where ice core
records can be recovered, Daily News reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Thomson, who has spent 25 years studying glaciers, said
glaciers in Andes of South America and in Tibet are also
disappearing and soon it will not be able to recover ice cores.
</P>
<P>
The professor proposed to use a solar power drill to recover
three cores from the remaining ice fields of Kilimanjaro next
year.
</P>
<P>
He requested the Tanzanian authorities to grant permits to his
team of scientists to drill and recover ice cores from the
mountain and ship them back to the university for study, adding
that data on the cores will be shared with the Tanzanian
government and scientists.
</P>
<P>
The geologist appealed to the authorities to help look for
Tanzanian scientists who wish to participate in the project and
who can provide information on local climate over the past century
which could be helpful in analyzing ice core data.
</P>
<P>
If the project is approved, he said, the team will use an
experimental balloon to transport the ice cores from the mountain
to freezer trucks.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 19 (Xinhua) - The following are major
news items in leading Israeli newspapers Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Turkish Ambassador Barlas Ozener warned the Israeli
government Thursday not to make contact with officials of the
Kurdistan Workers Party, saying "this is a matter of principle."
</P>
<P>
Israeli sources said such contact may be sought despite Turkish
aversion in an attempt to avoid an escalation of violence after
the killing of three Kurdish protesters at the Israeli Consulate
in Berlin on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- In an attempt to prevent Kurdish reprisals over Wednesday's
Berlin attack, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has
instructed the secret service Mossad to informally pass on a
message to figures associated with the PKK, stating that Israel is
determined to stay out of the Turkish-Kurdish conflict.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Police are angry over Netanyahu's involvement in the
investigation into an alleged bribery case involving Foreign
Minister Ariel Sharon. Sharon is suspected of taking a retired
army general on a trip to Russia in 1997 in exchange for
his favorable testimony concerning Sharon's role in the 1982
Lebanon war. But Netanyahu said Thursday it was he himself who
proposed that Sharon include the general in his entourage.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Expects 9.4 PC Growth in 1998/99 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, February 19 (Xinhua) -- The National Bank of
Ethiopia said an economic growth rate of 9.4 percent is expected
during the current 1998/ 99, the Ethiopian Herald reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia's 1998/99 fiscal year will end on July 7, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The bank said the expected economic growth rate was made
possible by the remarkable boost in the agricultural sector,
comprising 47 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP), which
increased from 7.6 percent last year to 10.3 percent now.
</P>
<P>
The bank said the industrial sector will register a growth rate
of 8.9 percent, the distribution and service sector 9 percent and
other sectors 8. 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
The foreign currency reserve will be sufficient for three or
more months, and in the rate of inflation, which stood at 1.6
percent last year, no increase was witnessed, said the bank.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the bank disclosed that a sum of 284 million U.S.
Dollars has been acquired from different sources during the first
quarter of the current fiscal year. Accordingly, 152 million U.S.
Dollars were obtained in foreign trade, 96 million Dollars from
various services and the remaining in aid and loans.
</P>
<P>
The bank said that the earnings acquired during the period
represent an increase of 36 million U.S. Dollars over that of the
same period last year.

<HEADLINE> Export Up 6.4 Percent in Mozambique </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Mozambique's export continued
its upward momentum last year, with its value reaching 250 million
U.S. Dollars, up by 6.4 percent from the 234 million Dollars in
1997.
</P>
<P>
Felisberto Ferrao, president of the administrative council of
the Export Promotion Institute of Mozambique (IPEX), revealed this
Thursday, according to Friday's Noticias newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Due to the plummeting prices of preliminary products on the
international market, the increase in export value depends mainly
on the volume of export, said Ferrao.
</P>
<P>
Prawn is the largest export item of Mozambique, accounting for
about 30 percent of the total export. Other exports include
cotton, dried coconut meat, cashew nuts, sugar and tea.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe is the country's major export market, to be followed
by Spain, South Africa, Portugal, the United States, India and
Japan.

<HEADLINE> Japan's 1999 Budget Approved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Japan's lower house of
parliament Friday approved the country's 1999 national budget
featured in spending increase and tax cut.
</P>
<P>
The 81.9-trillion yen (682.5 billion U.S. dollars) plan, which
now goes to the upper house for a vote, is aimed at pumping more
money into Japan's weak economy, which is suffering from anemic
consumer spending, a record-high unemployment rate and a hobbled
financial system.
</P>
<P>
The budget will boost spending by 5.4 percent with tax cut of
more 9 trillion yen (75 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The budget also includes large increases for spending on social
security, scientific research and programs to retrain unemployed
workers. Foreign aid will total 1 trillion yen (8.3 billion
dollars), a slight rise from this year.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here, however, were doubt about the long-term effect
of throwing money at the economy without any key structural change.
They were worried that Japan's debt may rise.
</P>
<P>
Japan's cumulative national debt is already larger than its
gross domestic product (GDP). The U.S. national debt, by contrast,
is just half its GDP.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Mexican's team morale was at
an all-time low following the abrupt departure of goalkeeper Jorge
Campos, whose father was kidnapped on Wednesday in Acapulco,
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
Campos's father Alvaro was abducted by six or eight armed men
from a football field, which is named Campos.
</P>
<P>
Up till now, Campos's family have not received any news about
Alvaro. But it was heard that the kidnapers asked two million U.S.
dollars ransom money for Campos's father's release.
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time in Mexico that kidnapping occurred in
football," said Rafeal Lebrija, president of the Mexican Football
Association.
</P>
<P>
Rafeal urged the side Thursday to produce their best --
despite Campos's departure -- against Egypt when the two teams
meet in Friday's Lunar New Year Cup final at the Hong Kong Stadium.
</P>
<P>
The team were left devastated by the news of the high-profile
kidnapping of Campos's father.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> EU Team in Ethiopia to Mediate Border Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Diplomatic sources said
here Friday that a European Union (EU) delegation has arrived in
Ethiopia on a mission to continue diplomatic effort for the
peaceful resolution of the over 9- month Ethio-Eritrean border
crisis.
</P>
<P>
The EU delegation, comprising members from Germany, Austria,
Finland and the European Commission, is expected to meet
Secretary-General of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) Salim
Ahmed Salim and Ethiopian senior government officials here Friday.
</P>
<P>
This is the first mission to Ethiopia since the border dispute
resumed fighting on February 6.
</P>
<P>
The British Broadcasting Corporation quoted regional expert
Patrick Gilkes as saying Tuesday that "it has been estimated that
each side is spending a million Dollars a day. But this is likely
to be considerably under-estimated" regarding the cost of
Ethio-Eritrean conflict.
</P>
<P>
The EU delegation will fly to Asmara, capital of Eritrea,
Saturday on a similar mission after completion of their visit in
Addis Ababa.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Ethiopian Herald Friday carried a report on its
front page, quoting Gebru Asrat, head of Ethiopia's Tigray State,
as saying that "Ethiopia will continue its just war of
self-defense to ensure respect for its sovereignty in spite of the
call for cessation of arms sales to Ethiopia and Eritrea by the
United Nations Security Council."
</P>
<P>
Gebru, who is also politburo member of the Tigray People's
Liberation Front (TPLF) and Ethiopian People's Revolutionary
Democratic Front (EPRDF), said in a statement marking the 24th
anniversary of the TPLF that "the on- going war between Ethiopia
and Eritrea was provoked by the Eritrean regime itself. "
</P>
<P>
"It is inevitable that Ethiopia will undoubtedly regain its
territories at any cost, nor matter how long the struggle may last
or whatever sacrifices it may require," Gebru said.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Tea shops are booming in
Shanghai, China's financial and economic hub, and per capita tea
consumption in Shanghai has risen from 200 grams a year at the
early 1990's to the current 600 grams.
</P>
<P>
Liu Qigui, secretary general of the Shanghai Tea Association,
said that there are all kinds of tea shops in Shanghai, ranging
from elegant tea salons and "tea bars" in hotels to public tea
shops along the streets which cater to the needs of citizens from
different walks of life.
</P>
<P>
There are more than 5,000 tea shops and tea bars in Shanghai,
scattered in commercial centers and small lanes. Tea drinking has
become a fashion among Shanghai citizens, and tea shops are much
more popular than restaurants, according to Liu.
</P>
<P>
Youngsters often enjoy themselves playing cards and reading
newspapers and magazines in tea shops with a cup of tea, while the
elderly prefer drinking at old-fashioned tea tables with their
friends.
</P>
<P>
Shop owners also sell snacks and soft drinks mingled with tea
in over one hundred varieties. The price of a kettle of tea ranges
from five yuan to dozens of yuan, and in some self-service tea
shops it costs customers less than twenty yuan to taste all
snacks and drinks.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Vice-President Defends Role in Dams </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan Vice President
Specioza Kazibwe has defended her role in the famous valley dams
saga, saying she did not embezzle the fund nor neglect her duty.
</P>
<P>
In her 22-page defense report, Kazibwe said six of the 15 dams
are ready for handing over contrary to MPs' claims that there are
none, according to Friday's New Vision newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Kazibwe, who doubles as the Minister of Agriculture, Animal
Industry and Fisheries, called for an independent audit for the
valley dams fund to prove her innocence.
</P>
<P>
She also denied failing to giving political direction to the
ministry on providing 100 quick-to-fill valley dams in western
Uganda.
</P>
<P>
In the report to the select committee in Parliament probing the
 valley dams saga, she listed reasons for the delay of the dams
which include the El-Nino rains, low and unsteady flow of
counterpart funds, inadequate plant capacity and managerial
capacity of the contracting firms as well as land wrangles.
</P>
<P>
The vice president is now being probed for the mismanagement of
3.4 billion Shillings (3.4 million U.S. Dollars) Livestock
Services Project money meant for valley dams in western Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Kazibwe said she was not a signatory to the ministry's checks.
She was appointed minister in charge of that ministry in July
1996, yet the valley dam component was added to the project in
1994.
</P>
<P>
Previously, she said she was politically responsible for the
issue.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, February 19 (Xinhua) -- President Yoweri Museveni has
sacked Winnie Byanyima as information director of the ruling
National Resistance Movement (NRM) in Uganda.
</P>
<P>
A press release issued Friday by the President's Office said
that Museveni, as the chairman of the NRM, has relieved the MP of
her duties and responsibilities as director of information in the
Movement Secretariat.
</P>
<P>
It said the president regretted that despite his advice to her,
she has not refrained from taking positions counter to the
official stand and policy of the Movement.
</P>
<P>
Friday's Monitor daily quoted the MP for Mbarara municipality
as saying Thursday night that she was not all surprised at the
move by the president.
</P>
<P>
When the function of being a Movement official conflicts with
her role as a representative of the people of Mbarara
municipality, she would definitely choose to fulfill her
obligation to her electorate, she said.
</P>
<P>
Winnie Byanyima has been outspoken about the corruption among
Movement MPs and supportive of the censure motion against Minister
of Finance Sam Kuteesa who was said to be corrupt in the country's
privatization process.
</P>
<P>
It has been believed that Kuteesa, whose wife is the sister of
Friday Lady Janet Museveni, is using his close relationship with
the president to maintain his ministerial post.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan President Reshuffles Cabinet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap
Moi has made a surprise Cabinet and civil service reshuffle with
seven ministers moved and one assistant minister promoted, local
media reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
It was the first major shake-up Thursday of the year-old
Cabinet appointed after the country's 1997 general election. The
reshuffle still left the Office of Vice-president vacant.
</P>
<P>
President Moi had moved Simeon Nyachae from Finance Ministry to
the Industrial Development Ministry, swapping places with Francis
Masakhalia. However, the switch triggered Nyachae's immediate
resignation.
</P>
<P>
Nyachae is the third minister to have resigned during President
Moi' s 21 years in office, the Daily Nation newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Frank Kwinga is out as Principal Immigration Officer. His
position goes to Henry ole Ndiema, who has been the Registrar of
Motor Vehicle.
</P>
<P>
Long-serving Cabinet Minister Katana Ngala moved from the Lands
to the Public Works ministry and was replaced by Gideon Ndambuki
from the Office of the President.
</P>
<P>
Kipkalia Kones takes over as the new Minister for Research and
 Technology. Amukowa Anangwe has been replaced by Andrew Kiptoon,
who had been at Research and Technology.
</P>
<P>
The President promoted assistant Minister Julius Sunkuli in the
Office of the President as new Minister of State.
</P>
<P>
President Moi also made appointments in the public service.
J.K. Sang becomes the new Director of the Criminal Investigations
Department. He takes over from Noah arap Too, who had been moved
to the Public Service Commission as Chairman.
</P>
<P>
Former Traffic Commandant Philemona Abong'o has been appointed
as new Commissioner of Police, replacing Duncan Wachira.
</P>
<P>
Effecting the changes, President Moi said he noted the weakness
of the civil service, particularly in tendering and procurement
procedures as well as the implementation of government programs.
</P>
<P>
The government found it necessary to review its management
practices from time to time in order to maximize efficiency in
provision of service to the people, Moi said.
</P>
<P>
He urged that all the ministries and government departments
must publish performance and financial reports on a half-yearly
basis, and warned of strict control measures on expenditures
incurred and service or programs implemented to avoid misuse of
public funds.

ISLAMABAD, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Authorities have sealed off
Wagha border ahead of the visit of Indian Prime Minister Atal
Bihari Vajpayee scheduled for February 20-21.
</P>
<P>
The Pak-India border at Wagha, about 22 kilometers east of

with the deployment of a large contingent of all the law-enforcing
agencies including police, rangers and sensitive agencies and the
army, according to police sources.

The Punjab police had also called in trained security officers
from other provinces and at least 200 officials from the North
West Frontier Province and Sindh had already arrived in the
provincial capital of Lahore, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
"The agencies have been warned that they will be held
responsible in case of any untoward situation," a senior police

<HEADLINE> Acute Power Crisis in Bangladesh's Southwestern Region </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, February 19 (Xinhua) -- People in 21 districts of the
Bangladesh's southwestern region have seriously been suffering
from acute power crisis due to inadequate generation and supply
from the national grid, according to reports reaching here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The daily total demand for power in these districts was about
350 megawatt while the supply from various sources was only 230
megawatt, the Power Development Board (PDB) was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
During the peak hours, only Khulna-Satkhira zone needs about
100 megawatt, but the authorities could supply only 60 megawatt.
</P>
<P>
The production in the industrial units across the region has
seriously been affected due to the power crisis, said the PDB.
</P>
<P>
Load-shedding and other problems are the regular features in
the region, and the subscribers there have been suffering much.
So, they have urged the authorities concerned to take effective
measures to mitigate their sufferings, the reports added.
</P>
<P>
The installed capacity for power generation in the country is
3,091 megawatt, but available power generation capacity is only
1,900-2,000 megawatt and the peak hour requirement is 2,300
megawatt, the official statistics show. Therefore, load-sheddings
is frequent in this South Asian country.
</P>
<P>
The Bangladeshi government attaches importance to developing
the power sector to meet the ever-increasing demand for power, and
it has allocated over 12.5 billion taka (about 258 million
dollars), about 10.4 percent of the annual development plan's
budget, for the sector in the current July 1998-June 1999 fiscal
year.

<HEADLINE> France Keeps up Pressure on Kosovo Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 18 (Xinhua) -- France on Thursday kept up
pressure on Serb and ethnic Albanian negotiators at the Kosovo
peace talks near Paris, urging the rival sides to strike a deal by
the Saturday noon (1100 GMT) deadline set by the six-nation
Contact Group on former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"The two sides must now show enough courage to make a decision
to save the talks from capsizing," French Foreign Minister Hubert
Vedrine said.
</P>
<P>
Vedrine warned that not much time is left before the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) would carry out its threat of
air strikes on military targets in Kosovo should the talks fail in
the chateau of Rambouillet outside Paris.
</P>
<P>
U.S. mediator Christopher Hill said Thursday that the revised
final draft of a political settlement for the Serbian province has
provided further guarantee to maintain the republic's territorial
integrity and to respect Belgrade's sovereignty over Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
On the security issue, the West has proposed disarming the
Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) in exchange for Belgrade's agreement
to NATO's military presence in the province.
</P>
<P>
NATO regards the stationing of foreign peacekeeping forces as a
non-negotiable element in the peace package for Kosovo -- the
troubled province in southern Serbia, the dominant republic of
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Ethnic Albanian negotiators complained that the revision by the
Contact Group turned the balance in favor of the Serbian side and
the KLA's main negotiator Hashim Thaci left Rambouillet Thursday
for emergency discussions with the KLA's political representative
Adem Demaci.
</P>
<P>
Serbian President Milan Milutinovic, a key ally of Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic, arrived in Paris on Thursday night
to brief the Serb delegation on the next steps.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Cholera has claimed one life in
Harare, while 29 other cases have been reported in the capital,
prompting the Harare City Council and the Zimbabwean government to
introduce immediate control measures to contain further spread of
the disease, the daily Herald reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Tony Gara, Deputy Minister of Local Government and National
Housing, said Thursday, "The government is concerned about the
outbreak and is encouraging all stake-holders to ensure maximum
cleanliness in the city to avoid a major outbreak."
</P>
<P>
He appealed to residents to maintain high standards of
cleanliness and avoid buying fruits and vegetables from
undesignated areas.
</P>
<P>
Director of the Civil Protection Unit Madzudzo Pawadyira said
rigorous enforcement would take place to ensure that everyone
complied with the preventive measures being put in place.
</P>
<P>
The government has directed that all refuse be collected by the
Harare City Council and the Harare Prisons Services with immediate
effect, complementing private contractors who have failed to
collect garbage on time.
</P>
<P>
Cholera was first reported in Harare on January 13.  It is
believed that cholera is spreading due to poor refuse collection,
sewer blockages and overcrowding in some parts of the city, the
Herald reported.

<P>
ZAGREB, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Croatia's foreign policy this
year is aimed at joining the European Union (EU) and the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), Foreign Minister Mate Granic
said here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Granic told parliament in his 1999 foreign policy report that
strengthening cooperation with the United States would remain the
top priority of its foreign policies.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, expanding cooperation with Germany, France
and Britain were also Croatia's main tasks, he added.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, he recalled, the country had transformed from a war
footing to a nation at peace, acquired territorial integrity,
improved relations with neighboring countries and prepared for EU
and NATO membership.
</P>
<P>
This year, he said, the country would continue to work toward
this direction because this was the "only right thing to do".
</P>
<P>
He added that Croatia was enjoying increasingly good relations
with Russia.
</P>
<P>
He also said it should make efforts to promote its position in
world economy in order to meet the requirements for joining the
World Trade Organization (WTO) and Central European Free Trade
Area (CEFTA).
</P>
<P>
The EU has demanded that Croatia carry out reforms, amend its
constitution, allow a free press and realize judicial independence,
and achieve economic and financial stability.

<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, February 18 (Xinhua) -- NATO secretary-general Javier
Solana warned on Thursday that NATO would act swiftly if Serbia
and Kosovo's ethnic Albanians failed to reach a peace agreement at
talks in France.
</P>
<P>
He made the statement at a press conference in Skopje,
Macedonia, after talks with Macedonian Prime Minister Ljupco
Georgievski and NATO Supreme Commander General Wesley Clark.
</P>
<P>
"If an agreement is not reached, if the negotiations fail, NATO
knows very well what to do," Solana said.
</P>
<P>
But he expressed optimism that the two sides could reach a
peace agreement before the deadline of 11:00 GMT on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"I hope both parties think very carefully about the results if
the peace talks fail," he warned.
</P>
<P>
He said there were no immediate plans to evacuate the 1,200
OSCE (Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe)
verifiers in Kosovo, but they would be removed if necessary.
</P>
<P>
He also said Macedonia was very important to NATO actions on
Kosovo, and NATO would not stand any threats against it.
</P>
<P>
Sources here believed that Solana's visit to Macedonia at this
time was aimed to prepare for NATO strikes against Serbia if the
peace talks failed.

<HEADLINE> Kurdish Protests Turning More Violent in Germany </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Kurds in Germany staged more
violent protests Thursday after the killing of three Kurds by
guards at the Israeli consulate in Berlin during protests against
the capture of Kurdish Workers Party leader Abdullah Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
Several arson attacks on Turkish interests were carried out
overnight Wednesday in Stuttgart, Bremen and Nuremberg and the
state of North-Rhine/Westphalia, causing numerous injuries.
</P>
<P>
Kurdish rallies as well assaults or occupations of diplomatic
missions or German party offices were reported on Thursday in
major cities like Wiesbaden, Stuttgart, Bremen and Chemnitz.
</P>
<P>
The violence erupted shortly after three Kurds -- two men and a
woman -- were shot by Israeli guards as some 100 angry Kurdish
protesters tried to break into the consulate building in Berlin on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The German authorities reiterated warnings against Kurdish
militants, vowing stern measures to deal with violent acts.
</P>
<P>
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder said troublemakers would be
treated "with the total rigor of the law and judicial process"
while politicians called for an early expulsion of Kurdish
militants from Germany.
</P>
<P>
German Interior Minister Otto Schily, at an emergency interior
meeting Thursday, ordered police to be on high alert to guarantee
the safety of diplomatic missions.
</P>
<P>
A court in Leipzig on Wednesday issued warrants to detain 73
Kurds who occupied the Greek consulate in the city on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In Bonn, a spokesman for the Kurdish community said Thursday
that Kurdish leaders were prepared to give up violence in the hope
of solving the Kurdish issue through democratic means.
</P>
<P>
He urged Turkey to ensure the personal safety of Ocalan and
allow international observers to participate in the Ocalan trial,
or better, pass the trial to an international court.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan, head of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) who
had been hiding in the Greek embassy in Kenya, was captured by
Turkey on Monday. He faces terrorism charges for his leadership of
the PKK in its 15-year armed struggle for a Kurdish homeland in
southeastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
A wave of Kurdish protests swept across Europe following his
arrest, which some reports said was linked to U.S. and Israeli
secret services.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Banks in Thailand Calls for Arbitration Body </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Foreign creditors in Thailand
have been calling for the establishment of an arbitration panel
that will settle disputes arising from the debt restructuring
process in Thailand, a source from the Foreign Banks Association
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, foreign banks declined to sign a creditors agreement
that they would follow guidelines of the Bank of Thailand on debt
restructuring, including sharing of lending losses along the line
of the majority of creditors.
</P>
<P>
The foreign creditors suggested that they make a decision on a
case by case basis.
</P>
<P>
David Proctor, president of the Foreign Banks Association,
proposed that the arbitration panel be established jointly by the
Foreign Banks' Association, Thai Bankers' Association and the
Association of Finance Companies.
</P>
<P>
According to Proctor, there will be representatives from each
of the three associations on the panel which can make legally
binding decisions.
</P>
<P>
A good arbitration panel will be a mechanism to break the
existing deadlock in debt restructuring, he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the arbitration panel has to follow and be under
the existing laws and regulations.

DHAKA, February 19 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government has
planned to set up 20 more polytechnic institutes for spreading
technical education in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Executive Committee for National Economic Council has
already approved two schemes with an estimated cost of over 2.76
billion taka (56.9 million U.S. dollars) to implement this
program, the Bangladesh Observer daily newspaper reported Friday,
quoting sources of the Education Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The existing 20 polytechnic institutes will be renovated and
modernized under the schemes.
</P>
<P>
Among the 20 new polytechnic institutes, five will be set up
exclusively for the women at the five divisional headquarters of
Chittagong, Rajshanhi, Khulna, Sylhet and Barisal. Now there is
only one women institute functioning in the capital city of Dhaka.
</P>
<P>
Besides, construction works of three science and technology
universities will be undertaken in the districts of Gopalganj,
Rangpur and Patuakhali on emergency basis, the sources added.
</P>
<P>
However, the report did not mention when the schemes will start
and where the fund for the schemes comes from.

<HEADLINE> Bank of Thailand Sets Aside Funds for Possible Y2K Deposit Runs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 19 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Thailand (BOT)
will set aside some 85 billion baht (2.36 billion U.S. dollars) as
a reserve to cushion deposit runs which might be caused by the
millennium bug, a BOT source said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The reserve is part of a back-up plan in case banks fail to
correct the Y2K problem.
</P>
<P>
The BOT source said that the reserve would be sufficient to
deal with the situation, adding that the central bank had a
similar size of reserve when deposit runs occurred during the
closure of troubled finance firms.
</P>
<P>
The central bank might print more money to cope with expected
higher-than-normal withdrawals, he added.
</P>
<P>
The central bank's executive board are also considering
punishing banks which fail to solve the problem by June.
</P>
<P>
BOT said some banks had been slow to deal with the Y2K problem
because they were worried about their financial status and feared
it would not be worth the effort.
</P>
<P>
All banks are required to report the progress in solving the
millennium bug to the central bank every three months since
October last year.
</P>
<P>
A computer test run would be conducted during February 27-28.
If it runs successfully, it would help boost public confidence.

<HEADLINE> State-Owned Hotels to Be Privatized in Myanmar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, February 19 (Xinhua) -- A total of three state-owned
hotels in the country's northern Shan state will be privatized for
continuous business operation as part of Myanmar's privatization
scheme, according to the Privatization Commission (PC) Friday.
</P>
<P>
The hotels to be leased through competitive bidding are Kalaw,
Innlay and Pindaya hotels.
</P>
<P>
There are now 523 hotels in Myanmar, according to available
figures.
</P>
<P>
In January, the PC announced privatization of 68 other
state-owned economic enterprises (SEE), which include four
factories, seven rice mills and 57 cinemas.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, a total of 134 state-owned
cinemas and more than two dozens saw mills have so far been
privatized in Myanmar. Some 42 factories and two livestock
breeding farms have also been designated earlier to be sold
through competitive bidding.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar has, since January 1995, been implementing a
privatization plan for its SEEs, aimed at transforming them into
effective business organizations.
</P>
<P>
The first phase of the scheme covers 51 SEEs including
processing and manufacturing factories, livestock breeding farms
and cinemas, and is being implemented in various forms --
auctioning and leasing out the enterprises or establishing joint
ventures with local and foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
In a significant move to accelerate the privatization of heavy
industries, Myanmar transferred to local private entrepreneurs the
Ywama Steel Mill last September, the biggest state-run enterprise
leased out since the privatization plan began.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the first-phase privatization of all
small-scale SEEs has been completed and the second phase which
deals with about 1,760 medium- and large-scale SEEs is underway.

<HEADLINE> Europe to Help Thailand Combat Patent, Copyright Violations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 19 (Xinhua) -- The European Patent Office
(EPO) has promised to help Thailand in its battle against the
patent and copyright violations, the Bangkok Post reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
It was reported the European Patent Office would provide
technology and staff to help the Thai Commerce Ministry train
specialists and scientists to investigate claims before patents
are granted.
</P>
<P>
The ministry's Intellectual Property Department has only 20
specialists or scientists, too few for work. Their salaries and
benefits are the same as those for ordinary civil servants.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Commerce Minister Pravit Rattanapien was quoted as
saying that intellectual property was becoming a hot issue as more
and more countries were likely to use it as an excuse to protect
their trade interests.
</P>
<P>
The EPO will also help Thailand prepare a website providing
information on intellectual property linked to the EPO network,
Pravit said.
</P>
<P>
Since the Central Intellectual Property and International Trade
Court was established in Thailand 14 months ago, 2,499 cases have
been filed with claims totaling 46,6 billion Baht (1.29 billion
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Of the total, international trade accounts for 524 cases and
claims worth 36.4 billion baht (1.01 billion U.S. dollars), while
intellectual property claims total 1,975 worth 14.2 billion baht
(394 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The number of cases is likely to increase this year because of
pending legislation that will protect plant varieties, designs of
integrated circuits, use of geographical features and names as
well as trade secrets.

COLOMBO, February 19 (Xinhua) -- A record 20,000 Sri Lankan
male workers will obtain employment in Malaysia under a special

opportunities in Malaysia will be only for male workers as
requested by employers there.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Raise Minimum Wages by 16 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 19 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government has
decided to raise monthly regional minimum wages (UMR) by an
average 16.7 percent on April 1.
</P>
<P>
The decision was announced Thursday by Director General for
Industrial Relations and Labor Standards Syaufii Syamsuddin, local
leading newspapers reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Syaufii said the policy was intended to arrest the decline in
real wages caused by the economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
Despite the 16.7 percent increase, minimum wages will only
amount to 70 percent of a worker's cost of living, less than last
year's 76 percent when the UMR was raised by 15 percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said Workers in the Batam industrial region located off
northern Sumatra will receive the highest UMR of 290,000 rupiah
(33 U.S. dollars) per month, while those in Yogyakarta will get
the lowest UMR of 130,000 rupiah (14.95 U.S. dollars) per month.
</P>
<P>
Syaufii said the increase would still leave the average minimum
wage across the country far lower than the minimum physical
requirements because of the economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
He said minimum physical requirements were calculated on the
basis of daily energy intake of 3,000 calories for a single
worker.
</P>
<P>
The value of Indonesian rupiah (national currency) has lost
more than 70 percent against the U.S. dollar since July 1997 when
the monetary crisis hit Asian countries. As a result of the
crisis, about 80 million people out of a population of 202 million
have fallen below the poverty line and unemployment has risen to
13 million, about 37 percent of about 90 million people in the
labor force.

<P>
ROME, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Italian former anti-graft hero
Antonio Di Pietro was cleared of corruption allegation Thursday
when a judge in the northern city of Brecia ruled that he should
not be indicted for taking bribes to pervert the course of justice.
</P>
<P>
Di Pietro was said to have accepted money, via a one-time
friend and business associate, to shield an Italo-Swiss banker
from a corruption probe, when he was leading the famous anti-
corruption "Clean Hands" movement in 1992, the Italian news agency
ANSA reported.
</P>
<P>
The charges against Di Pietro emerged when he was serving as
public works minister under then Prime Minister Romano Prodi. He
resigned on November 14, 1996, when he was officially notified he
was under investigation.
</P>
<P>
He had denied the charges, saying he was the victim of a
political vendetta.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Di Pietro, now a senator, set up his own political
movement called Italy of Values, and now he is running for the
European Parliament elections in June with ex-premier Prodi.

<P>
WASHINGTON, February 18 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques
Chirac Thursday called for rapid reform of the international
financial system to promote world economic growth.
</P>
<P>
In a speech at the International Monetary Fund, Chirac said the
international community must strengthen its ability to deal with
crisis prevention to avoid the economic shocks that have swept
through Asia, Russia and Brazil in the past 20 months.
</P>
<P>
"Awareness of our vulnerability (to crises) came late," he said.
"It is painful. Let us accept the consequences and rapidly build
the new financial architecture we so need. We know which reforms
must be achieved."
</P>
<P>
Chirac, who arrived here Thursday for a two-day visit to the
United States, will hold talks with President Bill Clinton on a
wide range of issues concerning Kosovo, Iraq, Russia and global
financial systems.
</P>
<P>
He is also expected to meet the heads of the International
Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the inter-American Development
Bank.
</P>
<P>
Chirac said governments and international financial
institutions must become more open in disclosing economic
information.
</P>
<P>
"We must adopt a veritable 'highway code' for capital flows, a
code that applies to all, including hedge funds and offshore
establishments," Chirac said.
</P>
<P>
Chirac said France hoped to host a summit of the major IMF
members in Paris in the fall to officially adopt reforms the major
developed nations may agree on at their upcoming G-7 summit in
June in Cologne, Germany.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the Paris meeting, Chirac said, "would be to
officially adopt the reforms and give them international
legitimacy".
</P>
<P>
Chirac also stressed the need for stable exchange rates for the
U.S. dollar, Japanese yen and Europe's euro as these currencies
will dominate the international scene.
</P>
<P>
"One cannot hope for world financial stability while at the
same time accepting unstable exchange rates," he said. "We must
aim for more stable relations between currencies. This is a
daunting task."

<HEADLINE> Township Enterprises Thriving in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Township enterprises in
Beijing's suburbs registered earnings totaling 69 billion yuan
last year, 15.6 percent more than that of 1997, according to a
symposium on township firms recently held in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Total profits of the township enterprises amounted to 3.7
billion yuan, surging 17.1 percent on an annual basis, and the
added value reached 14.6 billion yuan, up 13.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
Many of the township firms have regained vigor through
restructuring of operation mechanisms. Official statistics show
that 5,388 enterprises which completed their restructuring last
year boasted earnings of 17.6 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Yue Fuhong, vice mayor of Beijing, said at the symposium that
the modernization of agriculture and a higher standard of farmers'
living rely on the development of township enterprises.
</P>
<P>
He noted that local leaders should attach more importance to
the development of township enterprises.

<HEADLINE> Heart Surgery Progresses in China (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 19 (Xinhua) -- A fast-growing economy is
elevating living standards of 1.2 billion Chinese people, while
creating more and more diseased hearts.
</P>
<P>
As China's economy booms, its people are better off than their
parents ever were, and they are making up for what they never ate
by eating more meat. Pork appears at almost every mealtime, eggs
are eaten in large quantities, while pork fat is saved as an
ingredient for tasty sauces. These meat-rich, oily dishes are
proverbial heart attacks on plates.
</P>
<P>
At present, approximately 15 million people, or 1-in-80 Chinese,
are troubled by various kinds of heart disease. Another 100
million people, having developed high blood pressure, are lining
up for heart attacks in later life.
</P>
<P>
Coronary heart disease, valvular disease, and congenital heart
disease (CHD) are three major categories of heart disease, which
now stands side by side with cancer as China's No.1 killer.
</P>
<P>
Due to excessive intake of high fat and cholesterol rich foods
and high amounts of protein, approximately ten million people
nationwide have coronary heart disorders. This figure represents a
quadrupling of the 1991 incidence, estimated Dr Zhu Xiaodong, a
clinically successful cardiovascular surgeon and president of the
Chinese Society for Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery.
</P>
<P>
In Beijing's Fuwai Hospital -- the nation's leading
cardiovascular medical center -- for example, about one third of
outpatients now are diagnosed with coronary disease. When the
hospital opened 40 years ago in 1958 the records show that only
three percent of its outpatients had heart diseases.
</P>
<P>
Coronary heart surgeons at Fuwai expect to get a lot busier. "I
wouldn't be surprised if coronary surgery ops jump another three
percentage points to make up ten percent of all open-heart
surgeries by 2000," said Prof. Shang Hua, a paediatrician
specializing in pre-and-post surgery care with the Fuwai Hospital.

LONDON, February 18 (Xinhua) -- England's new temporary
football coach, Kevin Keegan, has insisted he will not change his
mind and become manager on a full-time basis.
</P>

Speaking at a Football Association news conference, Keegan said
his mind was made up and that he had no intention of leaving his

Keegan will lead England in three Euro 2000 qualifiers against
Poland, Sweden and Bulgaria, as well as a friendly against Hungary,
while also remaining in charge at the London club.
</P>
<P>
He called it a "great adventure" but insisted it will end in
the summer when he returns full-time to Fulham.
</P>
<P>
Keegan said he does not even wanting to be considered as Glenn
Hoddle's long-term successor.
</P>
<P>
"I think I made it clear I didn't want to leave Fulham," he
said. "I have committed myself to something and I want to see it
through.
</P>
<P>
"I'm absolutely delighted to be in charge for four games, but
after that it's someone else's job."
</P>
<P>
Keegan said that although he hoped for success, the outcome of
his spell in charge will make no difference to his decision.
</P>
<P>
"It's for four games," he said, "but whatever happens it won't
change my mind."
</P>
<P>
"I don't like the term part-time, however, and I'll be giving
100% as always.

"When I join the England squad on the Sunday before the Poland
game, I'll give everything I can, " he added.

<HEADLINE> Albright to Return to Paris for Kosovo Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 18 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright will return to France at the weekend to further
pressure the Serbs and ethnic Albanians to reach a peace agreement,
the State Department said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
She will leave Washington on Friday afternoon and arrive in
Paris on Saturday morning, the State Department said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
Albright will "urge both sides in the negotiations at
Rambouillet to seize this opportunity to achieve an interim
settlement agreement for Kosovo", the State Department said.
</P>
<P>
It will be Albright's second trip to France to intervene in the
Kosovo negotiations. Last Sunday the secretary of state went to
Paris for her first intervention. Alternately threatening and
cajoling, she brought the two sides face to face in talks for the
first time.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Albright spoke to Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic, warning him of NATO's threat of air strikes if
a peace agreement could not be reached before NATO-imposed
deadline at noon Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"I spoke with him this morning ... and I think he understands
that this is a key moment in terms of the future of the former
Republic of Yugoslavia," Albright said after a meeting with the
Norwegian foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
"He should understand that if air strikes occur he will be hit
hard and he will be deprived of the things he values," she added.
</P>
<P>
Albright said progress "was far too slow" at the peace talks in
Rambouillet, France, and she stressed that both the Serbs and
ethnic Albanians should not underestimate the cost of rejecting a
peace deal.

<HEADLINE> Heart Surgery Progresses in China (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
All in all, CHD is by far the most prevalent form of major
heart disease. According to a 1996 survey in 189 major hospitals
nationwide, CHD operations comprised 68.1 percent of a total 18,
774 heart surgeries performed, while valvular diseases accounted
for 21.2 percent, and coronary diseases 2.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
One in every 200 new-borns in the country, it is estimated, are
born with heart diseases, and with annual births in the order of
56 every minute, that means an additional 85,000 young heart
patients a year.
</P>
<P>
In Fuwai Hospital, about 2,200 CHD operations on children were
carried out in 1996, more than doubling those performed in 1991.
</P>
<P>
"Despite that, many children are not treated in time," says
Shang Hua. The department of paediatrics received children under
10 years of age when Shang started her medical career at the
hospital 17 years ago. Inundated by the results of a baby boom,
the departments now only treats children under five.
</P>
<P>
It was not until the 1990s that heart surgery really became a
major medical practice in China. Since then "the number of
operations performed has risen sharply, more complicated surgeries
have been performed, and mortality rates have fallen," says Shang.
</P>
<P>
At Fuwai Hospital for example, over 3,500 cardiovascular
operations were performed throughout 1996 with a 1.13 percent
mortality rate. This figure approaches that of developed countries
in the world.
</P>
<P>
At present, a total of 30,000 heart operations are performed
nationwide every year. "Ten thousand of them are valve replacement
surgeries," says Prof. Wang Tianyou, vice-president with the
Chinese Society for Thoracic Cardiovascular Surgery. "Rarely
performed in China a decade ago, this op can now be performed in
all city-level hospitals."

<HEADLINE> 165 Cholera Cases Registered in Brazil This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Brazil has already
registered 165 cases of cholera so far this year, an official of
the National Foundation of Health said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Lucilia Nandir said that the majority of cases were registered
in the northeast region, particularly in the state of Pernamburco,
with 122 patients.
</P>
<P>
She noted that there was no efficient vaccination against the
illness.
</P>
<P>
She said the only way to stop the alarming spread of the
disease was to strengthen sanitary services. A step in the short
term would be to treat drinking water and food with hypochlorite
of sodium.

<P>
As for CHD operations, surgical techniques have attained a
level which permits surgery to be performed on babies just five
days old.
</P>
<P>
"Four decades ago, only some simple operations like those on
ventricular septal defects could be performed in our hospital, but
now the tetralogy of Fallot, one of the most complex CHD surgeries,
can be performed with a mortality rate slightly higher than one
percent," says Shang. In the 1960s the mortality rate for patients
undergoing such treatment was more than 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
Surgery involving the diversion of blood circulation outside
the body has been carried out on an extensive basis. The Anzhen
Hospital, another key cardiovascular research center, had
performed more than 10,000 such operations by April 1997.
Mortality rate was less than three percent.
</P>
<P>
However, China is still struggling in certain areas of heart-
disease treatment. Surgery on new-borns with complex malformations
are still regarded as being extremely risky.
</P>
<P>
Take heart transplantation for example, only 16 transplants
were performed in China from 1978 to date, while nearly 30,000
were carried out worldwide over the same time.
</P>
<P>
"The scarcity of heart donors really holds transplants back,"
says Wang Tianyou. He advocates a campaign to exorcise the
superstition in the minds of most Chinese who regard it as
necessary to leave this world in complete possession of their
anatomies.
</P>
<P>
"Besides, the cost of immunological preparation required for
heart transplantation surgery, which must be imported, is
financially prohibitive for ordinary people," Wang says.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Calls for More International Help in Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Palestine National Authority (PNA)
leader Yasser Arafat Thursday called for greater international
community efforts to help break the deadlock in the Middle East
peace process.
</P>
<P>
At a United Nations conference held here Thursday on the
Bethlehem 2000 project of events for the coming millennial Holy
Year, Arafat urged the international community to "redouble its
efforts" with a view to shifting an "unacceptable status quo".
</P>
<P>
He also reiterated the PNA's demand for an "independent state".
</P>
<P>
On the vexed issue of Jerusalem's status, Arafat said it could
well be the capital of two states, Israel and Palestine, in the
same way as Rome is Italy's capital and the site of the Vatican.
</P>
<P>
Arafat also voiced the hope that the Bethlehem 2000 project
could prove a symbol of peaceful coexistence in the Holy Land,
although it is still not free because it is surrounded by old and
new Jewish settlements.
</P>
<P>
At the conference, Arafat thanked Italy for its "pioneering
role" and "credibility" in the Middle East, and for its support
for the Palestinian cause.
</P>
<P>
Before the conference, which was held at the UN Food and
Agriculture Organization's headquarters here, Arafat met Italian
Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini, who voiced Italy's concern at the
stalled Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Dini insisted that any solution to the Middle East conflict
must be based on principles contained in UN resolutions.
</P>
<P>
After the conference, Italian Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema
met with Arafat and repeated Italian commitments in support of the
Palestinian economy through help with infrastructure projects in
Gaza and the West Bank.

<HEADLINE> Ilgauskas to Miss Rest of the Season Due to Injury </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 18 (Xinhua) -- One day after learning that
Zydrunas Ilgauskas will miss the rest of the season, the Cleveland
Cavaliers today placed him on the injured list and activated
rookie forward Ryan Stack.
</P>
<P>
Doctors anticipate that Ilgauskas will be sidelined for 3 1/2
to four months with a fracture of the navicular bone in his left
foot, meaning he will miss the entire abbreviated schedule.
</P>
<P>
Chosen by the Cavaliers in the second round of the 1998 draft,
the Stack was placed on the injured list on February 4 after
breaking two metacarpal bones in his right hand in the offseason.
</P>
<P>
Stack played four years at South Carolina, finishing second in
school history with 120 games played and fifth in blocked shots
with 124 blocks.
</P>
<P>
Ilgauskas' injury came just three weeks after he signed a six-
year, 70.9 million U.S. dollars deal with the Cavaliers, who had
been picked by many as a sleeper in the Eastern Conference due to
their strong core of talented youth.
</P>
<P>
It marks the second time in three years that a foot problem
will keep him sitting all year rather than running to the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
Ilgauskas missed what should have been his rookie 1996-97
season due to a broken bone in his right foot. The Cavs failed to
make the playoffs that season but did last year, when Ilgauskas
helped Cleveland finish with the sixth-best record in the East.
</P>
<P>
He sat out Tuesday's 90-78 victory over the Orlando Magic due
to the pain in the middle part of his left foot and it was thought
that he would miss only one game with a mild sprain. But An MRI,
CAT scan and bone scan at the clinic revealed the fracture.
</P>
<P>
The 23-year-old native of Lithuania was second on the Cavs
with 15.2 points and 8.8 rebounds per game through five outings.

WASHINGTON, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Rudy Tomjanovich was named
the head coach Thursday to lead the United States team in the
Americas Olympic qualifying tournament next summer at San Juan,
Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
The Unites States must finish first or second to qualify for
the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, Australia. Last summer, NBA players
could not participate in the World Championships due to the league'

</P>
<P>
Tomjanovich, coach of the Houston Rockets, took an U.S. team
without NBA players to finish third at the world championships.
This time, Tomjanovich will take nine NBA players and three
college players into the tournament.
</P>
<P>
"We were part of the field last year," he said. "That was a
team in the true sense with so many heroes who did their part.
There were so many negatives. They could easily have failed. They
pulled together and made a positive out of it. This summer will be
a different deal. We'll be the favorites."
</P>
<P>
The USA team will be picked by USA Basketball's selection
committee. The qualifying tournament runs from July 14-25 and will
include four teams from South America, three from Central America,

<HEADLINE> FA Admits: It's not Perfect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The Football Association have
admitted they are "back where they started" following Kevin Keegan'
s appointment as a short-term, part-time England coach.
</P>
<P>
Fulham's chief operating officer Keegan has agreed to take on
the England job - but for only one day a week - while he continues
his quest to take Fulham into the Premiership.
</P>
<P>
Keegan, who will take charge of only four matches, explained
his decision to stay at the Division Two club at a media
conference on Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The appointment of yet another part-time coach after FA
technical director Howard Wilkinson was given the reigns for only
a matter of days has been widely criticized.
</P>
<P>
And now even the FA have admitted they may have made a mistake.
</P>
<P>
The FA's acting chairman Geoff Thompson said: "It would appear
we're back where we started from. I can understand people saying
it's a mess."
</P>
<P>
Speaking in The Sun newspaper, FA international committee
chairman Noel White also questioned Keegan's appointment.
</P>
<P>
"We would prefer to have Kevin's services for far longer but
quite honestly not many people wanted the job. And Kevin's
contract dictated the outcome."
</P>
<P>
Former FA chief executive Graham Kelly also spoke of the
problems facing the FA.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on BBC Radio 5 Live, Kelly said: "They are back to
square one and have to start all over again."
</P>
<P>
"Obviously they (the FA) have majored very largely on Kevin
Keegan and they haven't been able, for whatever reason, to
persuade him to take the job permanently.
</P>
<P>
"Whoever comes along now is going to be second choice, that's
inevitable. I think Roy Hodgson is well qualified but his
experience at Blackburn has dealt him a fatal blow. The best one
is Terry Venables but they won't appoint him.
</P>
<P>
"It's a difficult situation all round," he said.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Resolved to Settle Kosovo Crisis Peacefully </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The Yugoslav government said
Thursday it was resolved to settle the Kosovo crisis politically
and peacefully.
</P>
<P>
After a meeting on Thursday about the peace talks between
Serbians and ethnic Albanians in Rambouillet outside Paris, the
Yugoslav government said in a press statement that it agreed with
the stand of the Serbian negotiators, the Tanjug news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
It said the Serbian and Yugoslav governments were resolved to
realize widespread autonomy in Kosovo in a peaceful and political
way on the basis of the principle of protecting territorial
integrity and state sovereignty, as the Serbian delegation
accepted the ten articles of the scheme of a peace agreement
proposed by the international contact group.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav government warned that the increasing pressure on
Belgrade to accept a NATO deployment in Kosovo and threats of an
air strike could only encourage the separatists and terrorists
instead of resolving the conflict.
</P>
<P>
The United States and NATO have said that a foreign peace
implementation force would be sent to Kosovo no matter what the
result of the Rambouillet talks is, warning that if Yugoslavia
refuses to accept the deployment, NATO would enforce it with air
strikes.

<HEADLINE> Italy Concerned Over Possible Death Sentence for Ocalan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The Italian government Thursday
voiced strong concern over the statements made by Turkish Premier
Bulent Ecevit which failed to rule out capital punishment for
Abdullah Ocalan, leader of the Kurdish Worker's Party (PKK).
</P>
<P>
The concern was voiced by Deputy Premier Sergio Mattarella
while answering parliamentary questions Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Mattarella reiterated Italy's call to Turkish authorities to
ensure that Ocalan receives a fair trial.
</P>
<P>
The deputy premier also told the parliament that when Ocalan
left Italy on January 16, he traveled to Russia aboard a plane
rented from a private company. Moreover, the PKK leader chose
voluntarily to leave Italy, he added.
</P>
<P>
Once Ocalan left the country he made no attempt to return and
he made no further use of any Italian-owned aircraft, Mattarella
said.
</P>
<P>
The European Union had lost a chance to play a key role in
finding a solution to the Ocalan case and to the plight of the
Kurdish, Mattarella said.
</P>
<P>
"What has happened since the capture of the PKK leader by the
Turkish government on February 15 shows the measure of dignity
with which the Italian government behaved when this affair was
thrust upon it," he added.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit announced Tuesday that
Ocalan had been brought back to Turkey from Nairobi, and it was
reported that Greek Embassy in Nairobi handed Ocalan over to
Kenyan authorities.
</P>
<P>
Pro-Kurdish demonstrations have continued at Greek diplomatic
missions across Europe since Ocalan's capture.

<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Mexico's gross domestic product
(GDP) grew by 4.8 percent in 1998, putting the country among the
world's best economic performers last year, Mexican President
Ernesto Zedillo said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The GDP growth was achieved "in spite of the lack of
international financial stability and the drastic fall of the
petrol prices", Zedillo noted.
</P>
<P>
He said that the nation was able to recover from the 1995
economic crisis "faster than everyone expected" as it had
maintained healthy public finances, which allowed high GDP growth
rates in 1996 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, the world economy grew by 1.9 percent, the seven
industrialized countries combined by 2.2 percent, and nations of
the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development by an
average 2.6 percent.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Anti-monopoly law Passed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 19 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's House of
Representatives has approved the draft anti-monopoly law after
three and a half months of deliberations, paving the way for a
competitive and fair business climate, a senior official said.
</P>
<P>
"This law is one of the legal tools aiming to give legalized,
fair business guarantee to all business players," Trade and
Industry Minister Rahardi Ramelan said after the passing of the
bills on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The law is a part of the thorough economic reform agreed by the
government and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), local
leading newspapers Friday quoted the minister as saying.
</P>
<P>
Under the law, three related companies can only control up to
75 percent of market share while in monopolistic industries, a
company or a group of companies can enjoy up to 50 percent of
market share.
</P>
<P>
A violation of the law is subject to a maximum penalty of 100
billion rupiah (One U.S. dollar equals 8,000/9,000 rupiah) fine or
six months in prison.
</P>
<P>
The law will come into effect one year after it is signed by
President B.J. Habibie. Companies are given a six month period to
comply with the new ruling that will force giant, monopolistic
conglomerates to reduce market share or sell their business units,
said the minister.

<HEADLINE> UK Ministers Bid to Quell GM Foods Row </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Five British Cabinet ministers
have joined hands in trying to halt the growing concerns around the
country over genetically modified (GM) foods.
</P>
<P>
After a day of protests by environmental activists, the ministers
wrote to every member of parliament setting out the Government's case
for not banning GM foods and insisting public health was their first
priority.
</P>
<P>
Activists opposed to GM food Thursday dumped four tons of GM soya
beans outside Downing Street. The protest came after a series of
scare stories surrounding GM foods and allegations the government was
split or performing a U-turn on the issue.
</P>
<P>
However, in the letter to all members of parliament, the five
Cabinet ministers stated that commercial planting of GM crops could
go ahead next year if all regulatory hurdles were cleared.
</P>
<P>
Full-scale commercialization would not take place until the
government had assessed all the information, including
environmental checks, but a moratorium was neither justified or
legal, the letter said.
</P>
<P>
The letter was signed by ministers for health, environment,
agriculture, trade and the cabinet office, but not by Prime
Minister Tony Blair, who has strongly defended the safety of GM
products, saying he eats them himself.

<HEADLINE> World Bank to Support Power Sector in India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank announced on
Thursday the approval of an adaptable program loan of 210 million
U.S. dollars to India to support the first phase of a Power Sector
Restructuring Program in the southern Indian state of Andhra
Pradesh.
</P>
<P>
The loan is the first in a series of adaptable program loans
totaling up to 1 billion dollars that the Bank plans to provide
over the next eight years to help transform Andhra Pradesh's power
sector from being a major drain on the state's budget into a
contributor of resources for priority sectors.
</P>
<P>
Adaptable program lending is a new type of investment
instrument approved by the Bank's Board of Executive Directors in
September 1997. It allows for greater flexibility than the
traditional instruments and involves a series of loans through
which the Bank provides phased and sustained support for a
long-term complex development program.
</P>
<P>
The first phase of the Andhra Pradesh Power Restructuring
Program will support the establishment of a new legal, regulatory,
and institutional framework and industry structure, and the
preparatory work for privatization of the distribution of power.
</P>
<P>
Total project costs are 300 million dollars. The
210-million-dollar single currency LIBOR-based loan to be provided
by the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, a
member of the Bank, is 20 years to maturity, with a five-year
grace period.
</P>
<P>
With a population of 72 million, Andhra Pradesh is among
India's largest and poorest states.

<HEADLINE> UK Asks Brussels to Enforce Free Power Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Energy Minister John
Battle said on Thursday that the European Commission must act
against European Union states who do not comply with the EU's new
rules liberalizing a quarter of the EU power market from Friday.
</P>
<P>
"February 19 marks the first milestone on the road to an open
and competitive market across the whole of Europe," Battle said in
a statement. "However, some countries lag behind and I expect the
European Commission to ensure that Member States comply with the
basic requirements of the Directive."
</P>
<P>
The EU Electricity Directive stipulates that the largest 25
percent of EU electricity consumers must be able to buy their
supplies on the open market, thus allowing large buyers from
Denmark to Portugal to secure power wherever it is cheapest. The
only exceptions are Greece, Ireland and Belgium, who have extra
time.
</P>
<P>
France and Italy are expected to miss the deadline but the
European Commission is unlikely to act against them, Reuters
quoted EU Energy Commissioner Christos Papoutsis as saying on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
France's tardiness has angered representatives of the British
and Irish power industry who said last week the delays caused by
the Commission's apparent reluctance to lay down the law will give
French state-owned utility Electricite de France (EdF) an unfair
advantage, according to a Reuters report.
</P>
<P>
According to Battle, Britain had gone much further down the
free market road than the EU Directive stipulates, with 50 percent
of the power market by volume now open to competition, resulting
in a 25 percent real fall in industrial prices since 1990.
</P>
<P>
"In the longer run the UK is looking for the full opening of
the EU energy market." he said. "If this does not happen consumers
across Europe will be the losers."

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council on Thursday unanimously adopted a presidential statement,
calling for "a smooth preparation" of free and fair presidential
elections, scheduled for the latter half of this year.
</P>
<P>
The statement was adopted by the Security Council after its
closed-door consultations on the current situation in the African
country.
</P>
<P>
"A smooth preparation of free and fair presidential elections,
for which proper steps should be taken as soon as possible,
requires a certain level of political consensus and the opening of
a genuine dialogue between all the constituent parties of the
National Assembly," or the parliament, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The Security Council calls upon the Government of the Central
African Republic to continue to take concrete steps to implement
political, economic, social and security reforms" to promote the
peace process in the country.
</P>
<P>
"The success, the future mandate and the ongoing presence of the
United Nations Mission in the Central African Republic are closely
linked to the fulfillment of these commitments, in particular the
immediate resumption of a constructive political dialogue," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council stressed the need for both ruling and
opposition parties to "cooperate closely and work actively with
the aim of achieving political consensus indispensable to
stability in the Central African Republic," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The 15-member body reaffirmed that "The government, the
political leaders and the people of the Central African Republic
bear the primary responsibility for national reconciliation, the
maintenance of a stable and secure environment and the
reconstruction of their country," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The Security Council expresses its concern about the
consequences that the current political tensions have for the
stability and the functioning of the institutions of the Central
African Republic," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"It also considers that consensual preparation for the
presidential elections can only reinforce the legitimacy of the
next president of the Republic and also secure a sustainable civil
peace," the statement added.

<HEADLINE> Bundesbank Sees No World Recession </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Germany's central bank said in
Frankfurt Thursday that while 1999 will be a difficult year in the
aftermath of the crises in Asia, Russia and Latin America, the
world is not heading for a recession.
</P>
<P>
In its monthly report for February, the Bundesbank said that a
positive factor was that the western industrial nations posed a
"considerable stabilising effect" on the world economy.
</P>
<P>
"All in all, 1999 will be a difficult one for the world
economy," the report said. "Nonetheless little points to - as is
variously feared - that the world economy overall could drift into
recession."
</P>
<P>
The Bundesbank cited the continued positive economic
development in North America, and to a lesser degree in western
Europe, as factors helping the situation.
</P>
<P>
In addition, "the international financial system currently
appears on the whole to be clearly more robust than a year ago or
at the outbreak of the Russian crisis in the summer of 1998", it
said.
</P>
<P>
The German central bank said that it appeared that the
situation in some Asian countries like South Korea and Thailand
was gradually improving. It also said that the Central- and East
European reform states were in remarkably robust shape.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Presents Development Agenda for Small States </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 18 (Xinhua) -- At the commencement of the
Commonwealth-World Bank Task Force on Small States, the World Bank
proposed on Thursday a development agenda specifically tailored
for 43 small nations.
</P>
<P>
Small state refers to nations with less than 1.5 million
inhabitants.
</P>
<P>
The Commonwealth-World Bank Task Force on Small States was
created to assess the transition costs of globalization as well as
develop an agenda to mitigate the vulnerability of small states as
they become further integrated in the World Trade Organization and
sub-regional trade regimes, the World Bank said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The task force will also work to raise awareness about the
particular nature of small states in the international community.
</P>
<P>
The Bank said it sees the plan accounting for small states'
volatility of per capita income when determining borrowing status
and accounting for the size of the state when determining
membership fees and operational procedures.
</P>
<P>
Other initiatives envisaged in the plan will aim to promote
regional agreements to share infrastructure facilities and to
facilitate institutional cooperation and labor mobility.
</P>
<P>
Another crucial objective is to develop knowledge sharing
mechanisms through distance learning, and interactive lines of
communication to a common information base.
</P>
<P>
The task force will present a draft paper on small state
development and action plan to the World Bank's Board and
Development Committee during the forthcoming joint Spring Meetings
of International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Bank.
</P>
<P>
After consultation between small states and multilateral and
bilateral agencies over the summer, the task force will present
the final version of the action plan to the Bank's Board and
Development Committee at the IMF-World Bank Annual Meetings in the
Fall of 1999.

<HEADLINE> Siemens Aims for US Listing in 2001 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, February 18 (Xinhua) -- German electrical engineering
giant Siemens AG aims to achieve a U.S. stock exchange listing in
the Spring of 2001, company chairman Heinrich von Pierer told
shareholders Thursday.
</P>
<P>
At the annual general meeting in Munich, he made the disclosure
while outlining the company's corporate restructuring efforts,
under which the semiconductors division will be split off into an
independent unit in Summer.
</P>
<P>
Pierer said the semiconductors division, with turnover of 17
billion marks (970 million dollars) and some 60,000 employees,
would be publicly listed by the end of this year or early 2000.
</P>
<P>
He said the company was still looking at similar disvestment
steps involving other Siemens holdings. At the same time, however,
Siemens is not in the market for any new major acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
"We're not going to let ourselves be caught up in the merger
fever," Pierer said.
</P>
<P>
In preparing for a U.S. stock listing, he said that by fiscal
2000, Siemens will have converted its accounting and financial
reporting to the U.S. GAAP (Generally Accepted Accounting
Principles) standard.
</P>
<P>
Pierer said that a listing in America would provide Siemens
with better access to the world's largest capital market and would
give the company comparable balance sheet standards worldwide.
</P>
<P>
The Siemens CEO said the company expected double-digit growth
in sales and profits in the current 1998-99 year through September
30, after profits last year plunged to 920 million marks due to
the costs of restructuring. The year before profits came to 2.61
billion marks.
</P>
<P>
Siemens expects turnover for the current year to rise by at
least 10 percent to go beyond 130 billion marks, Pierer said.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Backs Tougher Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council on Thursday backed a report calling for tougher sanctions
against Angolan rebels, known as UNITA, in an attempt to halt
renewed fighting in Angola.
</P>
<P>
In a statement read to the press here, the president of the
Security Council for the month of February, Robert Fowler of
Canada, said that 15 members of the Council "pledged to be
supportive of our efforts to implement the provisions of this
sanctions regime."
</P>
<P>
The statement was issued after the Security Council's
closed-door discussion of the report presented by the Council's
Sanctions Committee.
</P>
<P>
Fowler said members focused on "practical" measures and backed
the commissioning of an expert study to trace violations in arms
trafficking, the supply of oil, the diamond trade and the movement
of UNITA funds.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council accused the rebels of being primarily
responsible for sabotaging a 1994 peace accord that ended 20 years
of civil war. UNITA refused to disarm and hand over land under its
control to the government as called for in the peace accords.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the council agreed to consider restricting UNITA's
telecommunications links, and to reinforce other sanctions that
include a ban on diamond exports. UNITA has raised an estimated
3.7 billion U.S. dollars through diamond sales, reports said.
</P>
<P>
In a report released on Tuesday, the council's committee on
sanctions against Angola proposed enlisting banks and diamond
traders to track rebel funds and enlisting private companies and
individuals to track the transfer of military equipment to the
rebels.
</P>
<P>
The committee, headed by Fowler, also urged that any violation
of sanctions be made a crime. This would make it possible to
prosecute those who provide military or logistical support to the
rebels.
</P>
<P>
He said the committee is trying to determine what measures to
impose to limit UNITA's ability to communicate with one another and
the outside world.
</P>
<P>
The peace agreement collapsed in early December last year when
government forces failed in its attempt to seize the UNITA-held
territory by force.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan recommended pulling out the
U.N. mission after two U.N.-chartered C-130 cargo planes crashed
respectively on December 26 last year and January 2 this year as
fighting intensified between rebels and government troops.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan Government has repeatedly said it wants the
1,000-strong U.N. Observer Mission to leave because it failed to
prevent a resumption of fighting. However, the Security Council
wants to maintain a small political and military presence in
Angola to monitor developments.

<HEADLINE> World Bank to Launch New Financial Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The International Bank for
Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), a member of the World Bank
Group, announced on Thursday a plan on introducing new financial
products for its borrowers on September 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
The new financial products include a fixed-spread LIBOR-based
loan as well as free-standing hedging products linked to
borrowers' existing IBRD loans.
</P>
<P>
The fixed-spread loan will increase flexibility for borrowers
to tailor loan maturities and to manage currency and interest rate
risks over the life of the loan, while the free-standing hedging
products s from the IBRD's financial intermediation."
</P>
<P>
"Within a broader development context, they will promote client
countries' access to, and institutional capacity to utilize,
market-based instruments to manage their financial risks," he
added.
</P>
<P>
At present, the IBRD offers multicurrency pool loans,
LIBOR-based variable-spread single currency loans whose spread is
recalculated semi-annually, and fixed-rate single currency loans
whose rate is determined for disbursed amounts as they disburse
over time.
</P>
<P>
The IBRD will continue to offer the first two of these products
alongside the new fixed-spread loan, but the existing fixed-rate
loan product will be withdrawn as a choice for new loan
commitments is expected to assist borrowers to manage their currency,
interest rate and commodity price risks, the World Bank said.
</P>
<P>
While announcing the new products, World Bank President James
D. Wolfensohn said that "these products are a direct response to
client demand for more flexible financial products and risk
management tools, and will substantially raise the value added to
borrowers from the IBRD's financial intermediation."
</P>
<P>
"Within a broader development context, they will promote client
countries' access to, and institutional capacity to utilize,
market-based instruments to manage their financial risks," he
added.
</P>
<P>
At present, as of December 1, 1999, according to the World Bank.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Aims to Promote Trade with Canada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(by Gu Ming)
</P>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 18 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian President
Benjamin Mkapa said here Thursday that his country will develop a
new relationship with Canada, focusing on trade and investment.
</P>
<P>
Hosting an evening banquet for visiting Governor-General of
Canada, Romeo LeBlanc, Mkapa expressed the wishes to transform the
bilateral relationship from a donor-recipient one to a mutually
rewarding partnership which involves private people and
enterprises, and non-governmental organizations.
</P>
<P>
"That is why I am so glad that you brought with you Canadian
investors and business people," Mkapa said. "I have been
encouraged to learn that Canadian direct investments in Africa
have increased (by) four times over the last ten years, especially
in mining."
</P>
<P>
LeBlanc, who is leading a delegation of more than 80 members,
arrived in Dar es Salaam on Wednesday evening for a five-day
goodwill visit to the east African country.
</P>
<P>
The delegation includes members of parliament, business
representatives,

government officials, non-governmental organization (NGO)
executives, as well as personnel from the cultural and academic
sectors.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa expressed his gratitude to Canada's long-term assistance
through bilateral programs or multilateral institutions.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that Canada has done a lot in helping Tanzania
fight against colonialism and apartheid in history, as well as in
solving current refugee problems.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa said that he welcomed more Canadian investors to come to
the country.
</P>
<P>
He said that companies such as Sutton Resources, SAMAX, Antrim,
CANOP, Ocelot, Trans-Canada Pipelines, Dublin International,
Pangea, Tan Range, East Africa Company, Placer Dome, are
illustrative of the expanding cooperation between Canada and
Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa said the companies have also helped to market Tanzania
in Canada and elsewhere, as a worthwhile investment destination.
</P>
<P>
"We can make the ship of our relations of friendship and
cooperation to sail into the waters of the 21st century smoothly,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
LeBlanc said the relationship between the two countries can be
traced back to 1920s, when a group of Canadian missionaries came
to the beautiful land of Tanganyika.
</P>
<P>
Over the past years, he said, Canada has worked on development
projects in many sectors of Tanzanian society, including railways,
military training, agriculture, water and education.
</P>
<P>
He said Canadian companies are strengthening their commercial
links with Tanzanian enterprises.
</P>
<P>
"Trade and investment can help both of our economies grow
stronger." he said. "Canadians know this instinctively, because
foreign investment helped us emerge from a pioneer colony to a
prosperous industrial nation."
</P>
<P>
The Canadian governor-general also said his country supports
Tanzania's efforts in bringing peace and stability to the Great
Lakes region.

<HEADLINE> Russia Reopens Pushkin House-Museum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The Aleksandr Sergeyevich
Pushkin House-Museum was reopened Thursday, marking the beginning
of a series of activities celebrating the 200th anniversary of the
great poet and author.
</P>
<P>
Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, who was present at the
reopening ceremony, said Pushkin is not only part of the Russian
literature, he has also become part of the Russian soul.
</P>
<P>
The museum, located in central Moscow's historic Arbatskaya
street, had attracted flocks of visitors since it first opened in
1986. Pushkin spent some of his happiest days in the house with
his beautiful wife, Natalia.
</P>
<P>
Pushkin founded the literature of his language with epic and
lyric poems, plays, novels, and short stories such as Eugene
Onegin, Boris Godunov and The Prisoner of the Caucasus.
</P>
<P>
He provided a literary heritage for Russians, whose native
language had hitherto been considered unfit for literature.
</P>
<P>
Pushkin was mortally wounded in a dual on January 29, 1837 with
an officer in the Horse Guards and died February 10 at the age of
36. The Russian government has allocated 70 million rubles (about
3 million U.S. dollars) for the grand celebrations of Pushkin's
200th anniversary, which falls on June 6.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Producer Prices Show Biggest Rise Since </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 18 (Xinhua) -- The Producer Price Index in
January rose 0.5 percent, the biggest increase since October 1996,
after declining 0.1 percent for all of 1998 and 1.2 percent in
1997, the Labor Department reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
However, much of the rise reported in prices for finished goods
was concentrated in just a few items, such as gasoline, pork and
citrus fruit. Prices excluding the volatile food and energy
components actually fell for the first time in seven months,
edging 0.1 percent lower. Analysts believe inflation in prices
paid by consumers will remain muted this year.
</P>
<P>
Prices charged by food producers rose 1.6 percent, the most in
nearly six years, after slipping 0.1 percent during 1998. Energy
prices jumped 1.8 percent, the most in two years, but had fallen
12.1 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
In January, the price of pork shot up 18.3 percent, the largest
one-month increase in nearly 25 years, after falling 26.9 percent
over the course of the previous year in response to diminished
demand in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Economists attributed the rebound, in part, to winter storms,
which resulted in farmers sending fewer animals to slaughter.
</P>
<P>
Fresh fruits and melons cost 19.6 percent more than the month
before, the largest increase in 13 months, reflecting a 56.3
percent rise in citrus fruit and 26.7 percent in strawberries
following a freeze in California.
</P>
<P>
Gasoline prices climbed 6.5 percent, the most in 17 months,
after plunging 34.1 percent last year, and fuel oil increased 6.4
percent.
</P>
<P>
Outside food and energy, car prices fell 1.2 percent last
month, the most in a year and a half, and computer costs declined
4.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Separately, the Labor Department said Thursday that first-time
applications for unemployment benefits last week stayed at a level
signaling healthy demand for labor.
</P>
<P>
State unemployment offices received a seasonally adjusted
288,000 claims for benefits, up from 284.000 the week before. A
four-week moving average of jobless claims fell from 298,750 to
292,000, the lowest in 10 years.
