<HEADLINE> Four Killed as C-130 Hits Another in Pakistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Four crewmen were killed
and five others injured when a Pakistan Air Force C-130 aircraft
went out of control and hit a parked C-130 at the Chaklala Air
Base, around 20 km south of here, on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The C-130 Hercules aircraft was returning to the parking area
after a routine ground check, but it went out of control when a
fire broke out in its brake system, said officials with the PAF
Public Relations.
</P>
<P>
The plane hit another C-130 parked on the tarmac and both
aircraft caught fire and sustained major damage, they said.
</P>
<P>
A thick column of smoke could be seen from miles, causing panic
among the people living in the vicinity of the air base.
</P>
<P>
Fire brigade sources said at least ten fire tenders were used
to put out the blaze which continued for some 45 minutes.
</P>
<P>
The firemen said they pulled out four badly burnt bodies while
the five injured were rushed to local hospitals. Two of the
injured were reported to be in critical condition.
</P>
<P>
Immediately after the incident security was tightened around
the air base and no civilian personnel were allowed to enter the
area.
</P>
<P>
The extent of the damage to the aircraft could not be
immediately be ascertained, however it is estimated to be severe.
</P>
<P>
A board of inquiry has been ordered to investigate into the
incident.

<HEADLINE> Meeting on Gender Mainstreaming in South Asia to Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, September 10 (Xinhua) -- A two-day meeting on gender
mainstreaming in the South Asian region will begin here Friday,
the U.N. Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM) said in a press
release Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will draw together secretaries and senior officials
of the women affairs ministries, members of national planning
commissions, representatives of key NGOs and activists from the
seven member countries of the South Asian Association for Regional
Cooperation -- Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal,
Pakistan and Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, organized jointly by the Nepali government and
UNIFEM, aims to build on existing activities on gender
mainstreaming and to evolve a strategy and time frame for a
regional intervention for engendering the plan process, UNIFEM
said.
</P>
<P>
It said that the meeting will focus on the gender mainstreaming
of national development plans, and countries in the region will
share their current experiences of building gender issues into
development plans.
</P>
<P>
All participating states at the Fourth World Conference on
Women in Beijing in September 1995 agreed that gender
mainstreaming was one of the fundamental strategies to achieve
equality between women and men, and that an active and visible
policy toward it would be promoted.
</P>
<P>
Gender mainstreaming refers to a strategy for making gender
considerations an integral dimension in the design,
implementation, monitoring and evaluation of policies and programs
in all political, economic and societal spheres so that inequality
is not perpetuated and women and men can benefit equally, UNIFEM
said.
</P>
<P>
But the second South Asian regional meeting on women issues
which ended here Thursday noted that there is a lack of proper
mainstreaming of gender consideration across sectors in the
region, where gender continues to be seen as a "women's issue" and
the responsibility of the women affairs ministries only.
</P>
<P>
The meeting on gender mainstreaming will build on the
just-concluded regional meeting, which reached consensus on major
achievements, critical gaps and serious concerns that have
characterized the SAARC countries since the Beijing conference,
UNIFEM added.

<HEADLINE> Army Patrols in Belfast to be Halted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 10 (Xinhua) -- All Army patrols will be
removed from Northern Irish capital Belfast at the weekend because
of the reduced threat of terrorism, a senior police officer said
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Royal Ulster Constabulary Chief Constable Ronnie Flanagan said
the move would "undoubtedly have an impact on troop levels" in
Northern Ireland, and he hoped to move "as quickly as possible" to
remove all patrols.
</P>
<P>
"After this weekend we will be returning to the position where
there will be no military patrols in the greater Belfast area," he
said.
</P>
<P>
But for the time being, security will remain tight along the
border with the Irish Republic.
</P>
<P>
"It is a very welcome development and it is made possible by
the fact that we are continuing to have a significantly reduced
terrorist threat," Flanagan explained.
</P>
<P>
He said the number of soldiers in the province was under
review. But he denied that the latest move was meant to encourage
weapons decommissioning by paramilitaries.
</P>
<P>
"There can be no trade-off," he said. "I have a duty to care
and protect the people." Groups that were holding on to their
arsenals were "a potent threat" to the peace process, he added.
</P>
<P>
Northern Ireland First Minister David Trimble and Sinn Fein
President Gerry Adams held their face-to-face talks on Thursday,

<HEADLINE> U.S. Deficit in Current Account Shoots Up to Record High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. trade deficit in
the current account jumped 20 percent in the second quarter of
this year to a record 56.5 billion U.S. dollars, the Commerce
Department reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The deficit rose from a record 46.7 billion dollars in the
first quarter. The growth puts the nation on track to reach a
deficit over 200 billion dollars for all of 1998.
</P>
<P>
The development would be the worst since the government began
tracking the data just after World War II, and would beat the
record of 168 billion dollars set in 1987. Last year's deficit was
155 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
With economic troubles hitting Asia starting last summer and,
more recently, Russia and Latin America, American companies are
seeing their export sales slump. At the same time, sharply
devalued foreign currencies have permitted foreign companies to
sell cheaply in the United States.
</P>
<P>
The deficit in goods alone hit a record 64.8 billion dollars
in the second quarter, up 16 percent from the first quarter, while
the U.S. surplus in services such as travel and consulting, rose
only 1 percent to 20.9 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The current account, a more broad way for measuring external
trade also include investment flows between the United States and
other counties, and foreign aid.

<HEADLINE> Britain Supports New U.N. Resolution on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Britain Thursday expressed its
support to the U.N Security Council's new resolution on suspending
its periodic review of sanctions against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council resolution, which was unanimously passed
Wednesday, was designed to punish Iraq for announcing last month
it would no longer cooperate with the UN weapons inspectors.
</P>
<P>
British Foreign Office minister Derek Fatchett said in a
statement issued early Thursday: "This new resolution sends a
strong and united signal to Iraq that its tactics are
counterproductive."
</P>
<P>
"The move is a further response to Iraq's unilateral decision
on 5 August to suspend cooperation with UNSCOM (United Nations
Special Commission on Iraq)," he said.
</P>
<P>
Fatchett noted the Iraqi government had only delayed the moment
when the sanctions could be lifted and Britain would not support a
partial lifting of sanctions in exchange for Baghdad's partial
compliance with U.N. resolutions on giving up the weapons.
</P>
<P>
He also made it clear that the British government would not
rule out the possibility of using force as a possible option to
ensure the implementation of UN resolutions.

<P>
COLOMBO, September 10 (Xinhua) -- A Sri Lankan Opposition
Member of Parliament belonging to the United National Party (UNP)
Wednesday evening was grilled by the Criminal Investigation's
Department on an alleged conspiracy to overthrow the government.
</P>
<P>
Jayalath Jayawardena is reported to have had a clandestine
meeting with the political leader of the Tamil rebels, Thamil
Chelvam, in a Vavuniya jungle hideout of the rebel tigers in June
this year.
</P>
<P>
They are alleged to have discussed a plan to topple the
government. A Tamil driver who had taken Jayawardena to the
location for the meeting was arrested earlier, official Daily News
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Police sources were quoted as saying that Jayawardena had
violated Defense Ministry regulations which requires a person to
give the location of a terrorist or a group of terrorists if he
had knowledge of the same.
</P>
<P>
President Chandrika Kumaratunga revealed at a convention in
Kurunegala District Tuesday that the subject of the discussions
between Jayawardena and Thamil Chelvam was a plan to topple the
government.
</P>
<P>
She also alleged that both the UNP and the Tamil rebels
demanded the government to talk unconditionally with the "Tigers"
soon after this secret meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Tamil rebels have been fighting a war against the
government since 1983 for a separate state in the country.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Commander Says More Troops Could Have </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Marines Corps
Commander Major General Suharto Wednesday said they did not have
enough troops to cover every corner of Jakarta to safeguard the
capital during the rioting and burning in May.
</P>
<P>
The commander told the Joint Fact-Finding Team investigating
the riots that 31 companies, 3,100 troops in total, could easily
vanish in a city as large as this one, the Indonesian Observer
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Out of the 31 companies, 11 had been shipped from the Marine's
naval base in Surabaya in East Java, and the remainder were
supplied by Jakarta's own base.
</P>
<P>
Talking to reporters following a session with members of the
team, Suharto said his men had been on alert since May 6.
</P>
<P>
"I am just glad that my men did their best while carrying out
their job. However, I do not agree we were told about the riots
too late to prevent it from happening. I think if we had enough
forces at that time, it would not have been too late to react," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The government established the Joint Fact-Finding Team in July
to investigate reports that the May riots in Jakarta and other
cities, which left 1,200 people dead, were masterminded.
</P>
<P>
Suharto told reporters that he had no knowledge nor had
received information from his men concerning the theory of "an
engineered riot."
</P>
<P>
"I personally have no information of that issue and neither do
any of my men. I think that would be the part of the affairs of
(the armed forces) intelligence," he added.
</P>
<P>
Suharto will be the sixth prominent government official to be
questioned by the team, following former Jakarta Regional Military
commander Major General Sjafrie, Jakarta's Governor Sutiyoso,
former Jakarta Police chief Major General Hamami Nata, Chief of
the Armed Forces' intelligence unit Major General Zacky Anwar
Makarim and former chief of the Army's Strategic Reserve Command
Prabowo Subianto.

Manila Bulletin:
</P>
<P>
-- The Philippines has passed the performance review conducted
by a team from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) which would
allow the government to tap the existing 1.37-billion-U.S.-dollar
standby loan from the IMF to shore up the foreign exchange
reserve.

Manila Times:

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Launches Program to Spur Corporate Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government has
launched a program known as the "Jakarta Initiative" to help
troubled private companies deal with their massive debts,
newspaper reports said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The 'Jakarta Initiative' is a program that sets out principles
that can facilitate out-of-court corporate restructuring, and will
apply to both domestic and foreign creditors in a
non-discriminatory manner," Coordinating Minister of Economy,
Finance and Industry Ginandjar Kartasasmita was quoted as saying
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The move sets forth guidelines for negotiations that draw upon
strategies that have proven successful in other countries.
</P>
<P>
The guidelines are designed to promote the availability of
interim financing to companies undergoing restructuring, as well
as the provision of information by these companies, so that their
restructuring proposals can be effectively evaluated by creditors.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's private debt now totals around 84 billion U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah has lost about 80 percent of its value against the
U.S. dollar since July last year, making it virtually impossible
for companies to repay their dollar-denominated debts.
</P>
<P>
"Our path to economic recovery must focus on rehabilitating our
private companies, so that they will have access to new capital in
order to develop the economy and enable the creation of
employment," Ginandjar said.
</P>
<P>
The program also provides for the establishment of a government
task force, the Jakarta Initiative Task Force, whose mandate will
be to facilitate out-of-court negotiations and remove regulatory
obstacles to restructuring.
</P>
<P>
The task force will be chaired by the head of Bapepam, the
capital market watchdog, Jusuf Anwar.
</P>
<P>
Ginandjar said that the Jakarta Initiative was also designed to
complement the new bankruptcy law and the private sector foreign
debt settlement mechanism provided by the Indonesian Debt
Restructuring Agency and would help facilitate rehabilitation of
the banking sector.

<HEADLINE> Bank Indonesia to Convert Up to 15 Million Dollars Daily </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government
will convert up to 15 million U.S. dollars daily in its effort to
stabilize the rupiah, the Indonesian Observer Thursday quoted the
central bank governor as saying.
</P>
<P>
The amount may vary between 5 million and 15 million U.S.
dollars, Bank Indonesia Governor Sjahril Sabirin said, adding that
dollars will be taken from foreign aid provided to the country.
</P>
<P>
"This is not intervention. It will be carried out until the
rupiah reaches the level that the government wants," he told
reporters here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Sabirin did not say when the "intervention" is to start and
added that the program will last until the ailing currency
stabilizes.
</P>
<P>
The central bank governor did not mention the targeted exchange
rate. But the government has targeted a 10,000 rupiah/U.S. dollar
level by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah Wednesday ended the trading day in Jakarta at
11,700/11,800.
</P>
<P>
Considered the world's worst performing currency in 1997, the
rupiah has lost around 80 percent of its value against the U.S.
dollar since July last year when the regional currency turmoil
began.

The Australian:
</P>

backfired Wednesday, when Treasurer Peter Costello conceded that

capital flows that ignited the Asian financial crisis, Moody's
Investors Services warned Thursday.
</P>

surveillance to monitor their workers and the general public,

"Canada is honored by President Mandela's visit," said the
Canadian Prime Minister in a release. "He is a living symbol of

<HEADLINE> Britain Supports New U.N. Resolution on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Britain Thursday expressed its
support to the U.N Security Council's new resolution on suspending
its periodic review of sanctions against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council resolution, which was unanimously passed
Wednesday, was designed to punish Iraq for announcing last month
it would no longer cooperate with the UN weapons inspectors.
</P>
<P>
British Foreign Office minister Derek Fatchett said in a
statement issued early Thursday: "This new resolution sends a
strong and united signal to Iraq that its tactics are
counterproductive."
</P>
<P>
"The move is a further response to Iraq's unilateral decision
on 5 August to suspend cooperation with UNSCOM (United Nations
Special Commission on Iraq)," he said.
</P>
<P>
Fatchett noted the Iraqi government had only delayed the moment
when the sanctions could be lifted and Britain would not support a
partial lifting of sanctions in exchange for Baghdad's partial
compliance with U.N. resolutions on giving up the weapons.
</P>
<P>
He also made it clear that the British government would not
rule out the possibility of using force as a possible option to
ensure the implementation of UN resolutions.

<HEADLINE> Primakov Calls on EU for Supporting Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Russia's acting Foreign
Minister Yevgeny Primakov on Thursday confirmed that "Russia is
loyal to the course of economic and political reform", according
to the Interfax news agency.
</P>
<P>
This remark voiced by Primakov, who was just nominated by the
Russian president as prime minister, when meeting with the
representatives of the European Union delegation.
</P>
<P>
After the 45-minute meeting, head of the EU delegation Austrian
diplomat Peter Hoenchvelner told the press that Primakov "had made
no special requests, except one: to support Russia in its
reforms."
</P>
<P>
"The EU will react positively" to the request, the Austrian
diplomat said and expressed hope that the foreign ministers of
Australia, Britain and Germany would soon come to Moscow.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the EU delegation brought to Moscow a
statement approved by EU foreign ministers in Salzburg last
Saturday. The statement expresses the solidarity of EU with Russia
"at a critical time and confidence that Russia would overcome its
difficulties."
</P>
<P>
Hoenchvelner said that today's meeting convinced them that "our
hopes are justified and reforms in Russia will continue".
</P>
<P>
Russian acting Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Avdeyev told
the press that at the meeting Primakov "reaffirmed Russia's
determination to broaden strategic partnership with the European
Union."
</P>
<P>
He said the meeting was focused on the problems, values and
priorities which will be discussed during meeting of Russian
President Boris Yeltsin with the EU leaders in October.
</P>
<P>
The representatives also discussed ways of making the EU
support for Russia more effective in this dramatic period.
</P>
<P>
The EU is interested in the promotion of reform in Russia and
will support the programs which the Russian people, parliament and
government will chose, Avdeyev said.
</P>
<P>
In his view, the EU is ready to give Russia moral and other
support at this crucial period.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Urged to Release Lesotho Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 10 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela should immediately release the three-nation
commission report on the alleged electoral fraud in Lesotho, the
country's opposition alliance said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Mandela should note that the Basotho people had waited far too
long for the results of the commission's probe and there was no
need for it to be tabled first at a meeting of Southern African
Development Community (SADC) heads of state in Mauritius, South
African Press Association (SAPA) quoted Basotho National Party
leader Everestus Sekhonyane as saying.
</P>
<P>
"We want South Africa, especially President Nelson Mandela, as
our only neighbor, to consider our plea.
</P>
<P>
"This (The report) has got nothing to do with Mauritius, even
(Zimbabwean President) Robert Mugabe," Sekhonyane said, referring
to South African Deputy President Thabo Mbeki's announcement
Wednesday night that the report would first be handed over to
Mandela, Mugabe and Botswana President Festus Mogae.
</P>
<P>
An earlier proposal that the report should be tabled first to
SADC summit in Mauritius on September 13-14, before being made
public, was rejected by the opposition alliance.
</P>
<P>
Sekhonyane said that the opposition had invited South Africa
to investigate their complaint that the May 23 general election
was rigged to favor the ruling Lesotho Congress for Democracy,
which won with a landslide.
</P>
<P>
"They have done so. They have seen the report. Now we should
be the next group to see it, not people somewhere in Mauritius,
who have nothing to do with our situation."
</P>
<P>
Mbeki and his SADC troika colleagues on Lesotho -- Botswana
Foreign Minister Mompati Merafhe and Zimbabwe's envoy to Maseru
Nelson Moyo -- held a series of meetings with Lesotho government
and opposition parties about the report on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki announced that the troika would not make the report
public as expected, but wanted to table it at the SADC meeting
first.
</P>
<P>
This evoked objections from the opposition, leading to a
compromise that the report plus the responses from all stake
holders would be handed to the presidents of South Africa,
Zimbabwe and Botswana, who would then make a decision on the way
forward.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's UMNO Youth Chief Refuses to Quit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's ruling United
Malays National Organization (UMNO) Youth chief Ahmad Zahid Hamidi
said Thursday that he will not resign from the post and will leave
it to the UMNO Supreme Council to decide his position in the
movement.
</P>
<P>
A special meeting of the UMNO Youth executive committee here
Thursday unanimously resolved that his position in the movement be
decided by party president Mahathir Mohamad who is the country's
prime minister, Ahmad Zahid told reporters at a brief press
conference after chairing a five-hour meeting of the committee.
</P>
<P>
Ahmad Zahid is known as a strong supporter of former Deputy
Prime Minister and Finance Minister Anwar Ibrahim who was ousted
from the cabinet and expelled from UMNO of which he was the deputy
president last week.
</P>
<P>
Ahmad Zahid had earlier been pressured by UMNO Youth leaders
from the state and divisional levels "to resign honorably" for
failing to express the movement's support for Anwar's expulsion
and for being frequently in the former deputy prime minister's
house.
</P>
<P>
"They cannot force me to resign, I will not resign from the
post," Ahmad Zahid said, adding that he would not step down as he
was elected by the delegates and in line with the UMNO
constitution and regulations he could not be dismissed from the
post.
</P>
<P>
"If any among the committee members are not happy with my
remaining as head of the movement, then they will have to wait for
the party president to make a decision on my position," he said.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Ends Transport Ministers Meeting in Singapore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, September 10 (Xinhua) -- ASEAN Transport Ministers
ended their two-day fourth meeting here Thursday after signing an
agreement on mutual recognition of vehicle inspection certificates
and endorsing a framework agreement on cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Singapore Minister for Communications Mah Bow Tan told a press
conference at the end of the meeting that the Agreement on the
Recognition of Commercial Vehicle Inspection Certificates of Goods
and Public Service Vehicles by ASEAN member countries will
facilitate cross-border movement of such vehicles.
</P>
<P>
With the agreement, public service and goods vehicle operators
from ASEAN member countries will no longer be required to send
their vehicles for inspection checks before they enter another
ASEAN member country, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Mah Bow Tan said the ministers also endorsed the ASEAN
Framework Agreement on the Facilitation of Goods in Transit which
will be signed at the ASEAN summit in Hanoi, Vietnam, on December
15 and 16, 1998.
</P>
<P>
They also agreed to have a separate ASEAN Framework Agreement
on the Facilitation of Inter-State Transport and directed senior
transport officials to target the conclusion and the operation of
the accord by year 2000, Mah Bow Tan added.
</P>
<P>
The minister noted that the key objective of the ASEAN
Framework Agreement on the Facilitation of Goods in Transit is to
facilitate the movement of goods in transit among ASEAN countries
by simplifying all transit transport procedures and requirements
and minimizing unnecessary delays or restrictions.
</P>
<P>
Mah Bow Tan said the ministers also exchanged views on current
transport issues in ASEAN and in particular, on the impact of the
current economic downturn in the ASEAN transport sector.
</P>
<P>
They held a common view that there is urgency to enhance the
region's economic competitiveness through closer cooperation and
agreed to explore various areas for cooperation although concrete
consensus on a series of issues has yet to be reached, he added.
</P>
<P>
Mah Bow Tan said the ministers expressed confidence that the
long-term prospects for the region remain positive although the
present crisis has dampened demand for transport services and
created adverse employment dislocations.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN now groups Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar,
the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.

<P>
CANBERRA, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar traded
quietly Thursday, finishing the session slightly lower at 58.72
U.S. cents from Wednesday's 58.81 U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
"It hasn't been volatile but it has been choppy trading," said
an expert. "Basically, the market is still trying to come to grips
with the mess that the Bank of Japan (BOJ) created overnight with
the rate cut."
</P>
<P>
The BOJ cut its short-term interest rate to 0.25 percent from
0.5 percent on Wednesday night, the first change in its benchmark
rate since September 8, 1995.

The Japanese yen sank against the U.S. dollar on the news and
the Australian dollar followed suit, dropping to a low of 58.15

<HEADLINE> DPRK Says Progress Made in Talks With U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) said on Thursday that agreement has been
reached on some issue with the United States in recent high-level
talks.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made by a DPRK Foreign Ministry spokesman
when commenting on the latest round of DPRK-U.S. talks concluded
in New York last week.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the United States admitted its failure to
fulfil the program of light water reactor project and supply of
heavy oil.
</P>
<P>
He said the U.S. promised to begin the supply of heavy oil due
for this year in late September and complete it by the end of the
year, enter into light water reactor project in real earnest from
November, hold negotiations for deleting the DPRK from the list of
"terrorism sponsor nations" and lift the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
He also said the U.S. promised to take positive measures for
continued humanitarian assistance.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the two sides have also reached an agreement
in a package form on mutual pending issues such as the four-party
talks and the missile talks.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman defended DPRK's launching of a satellite on
August 31, saying that the development, launch and use of
satellites were internationally-recognized rights of a state with
sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
He said at the talks the DPRK side made it clear that in case
the U.S. takes a step backward again, the DPRK will take practical
measures to show that it can not unilaterally sacrifice its own
nuclear power industry.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the DPRk will watch how the U.S. side
implements the agreement in the future.

JERUSALEM, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The number of Palestinians
supporting the peace process and the Oslo Accords declined, said a
public opinion poll released here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The poll, conducted by the Jerusalem Media and Communication
Center (JMCC) by the end of August, said the decline in support
shown this year is a departure from the first four years of Oslo,
when the Palestinian public showed consistent support for the
Palestinian-Israeli peace process despite sudden and dramatic
political and economic changes.
</P>
<P>
The negative trend can be measured through three main
indicators of the poll: support for Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat, his faction Fatah and the peace process itself.
</P>
<P>
In a poll conducted by JMCC in December 1996, 78.1 percent of
Palestinians surveyed showed support for the peace process, and
now only 55.6 Palestinians expressed strong or lukewarm support.
</P>
<P>
Arafat was considered in the poll of December 1996 the most
trusted politician by 42 percent Palestinians surveyed and now the
percentage has declined to 32.6 in the new poll, while Fatah's
support declined from 42 percent to the present 34.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
Anyway, 68.6 percent of the newly surveyed Palestinians were
still optimistic about peace, while 29.7 percent were pessimistic,
according to the poll.
</P>
<P>
The poll was conducted among 1,192 Palestinians over the age of
18, with 757 from the West Bank and others from Gaza Strip.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria, Canada to Restore Diplomatic Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Diplomatic relations between
Nigeria and Canada will be fully restored in October when both
countries reopen their high commissions, Nigerian Foreign
Minister Ignatius Olisemeka said.
</P>
<P>
After a closed door meeting with the visiting Canadian
Secretary of State for Latin America and Africa David Kilgour in
Abuja Wednesday, the minister said, "by mid October, the Nigerian
mission in Ottawa, Canada, will be full of activities."
</P>
<P>
Kilgour who arrived here last Sunday told reporters In capital
Abuja that Canada "is now prepared to go into full bilateral
relations with Nigeria by mid October this year."
</P>
<P>
The diplomatic relations between the two countries were
severed in 1995 when Canada closed its embassy in Lagos
following the hanging of nine minority rights activists on
November 10, 1995 by the then Sani Abacha government.
</P>
<P>
Alleged human rights abuses by the late Gen. Abacha regime led
to a spate of international sanctions against Nigeria including
the suspension of Nigeria's membership from the Commonwealth of
Nations.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic relations with South Africa, Britain and United
States also went sour in 1996 when the Abacha government
rationalized the human rights abuses in the West African country.

LONDON, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Britain announced Thursday it
was planning a series of public relations campaigns abroad in an
effort to promoted the country's image in some of the world's
major nations.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a London seminar on projecting a new identity for
Britain as the new millennium approaches, British Foreign Office

The British minister noted that the other series are expected
to be held in China, Brazil, Poland, South Africa and the United

development, their political importance for Britain and market
opportunities," Fatchett said.

<HEADLINE> Kabila Allies Get Tough Despite Truce Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Allies of Congolese
President Laurent Kabila have vowed they will not withdraw their
troops from the country until Rwanda and Uganda have done so
first, it was reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia, which sent troops to Congo (K)
to help Kabila stop a Tutsi-led rebellion, made the vow despite a
cease-fire agreement they were party to earlier this week,
reported South African Press Association (SAPA).
</P>
<P>
"We can't be cheated and lured into a withdrawal. We will do
it on a reciprocal basis, depending on the situation," Zimbabwean
President Robert Mugabe was quoted as telling a Zimbabwean weekly
magazine released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Independent Financial Gazette quoted Mugabe as saying that
Angolan President Jose Eduardo Dos Santos and Namibian President
Sam Nujoma agreed with Mugabe that their forces would only leave
once Congo was cleared of all foreign forces.
</P>
<P>
"Until we reach an agreement with the government of Congo, we
will remain there," Dos Santos was quoted as saying. "So we will
be there until the withdrawal of invading foreign troops."
</P>
<P>
The newspaper also quoted Zimbabwean Defense Force commander
General Vitalis Zvinavashe as saying the war would intensify if
the rebels and their backers did not observe the cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
The hardening of attitudes by the three southern African
governments came only two days after Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia
agreed with rebel allies Uganda and Rwanda on a provisional
cease-fire and withdrawal of foreign troops from Congo.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was announced Tuesday by Zambia's President
Frederick Chiluba, who chaired a two-day summit at Victoria
Falls, Zimbabwe, aimed at resolving the conflict in the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
The presidents of Uganda and Rwanda were at Victoria Falls for
the summit, but a delegation of Congolese rebels was not allowed
to participate in the meeting. The rebels then declared they
would not observe the provisional cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda and Uganda have consistently denied they have had
anything to do with the fighting, and dismissed Zimbabwean claims
that hundreds of their soldiers have been captured.
</P>
<P>
But Mugabe said in the report: "We have evidence, we can give
you tapes on them."
</P>
<P>
"Rwanda is just afraid to admit it has troops there but they
are the ones with more troops in Congo than anyone else," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Defense ministers and army commanders from all six countries
involved in the Congo conflict were meeting Thursday at the
Organization of African Unity headquarters in Addis Ababa in
Ethiopia to draft a plan for the cessation of fighting and the
withdrawal of all foreign troops.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Targets 4 Percent Economic Growth in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus expects a 4 percent
economic growth in 1999 despite a grim global situation, Finance
Minister Christodoulos Christodoulou said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after a Cabinet meeting which approved the 1999 state
budget, Christodoulou described the prospects for Cyprus' economic
growth in 1999 as "encouraging".
</P>
<P>
"The rate of economic growth is expected to reach 4 percent in
real terms, despite the increasingly difficult outside environment
because of the financial crisis in Asia and Russia," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Unemployment is expected to be maintained at around 3
percent and the inflation rate at 2.5 to 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
"The rate of growth is satisfactory and if there are no
unexpected outside or domestic developments, the local economy in
1998 and 1999 will be very satisfactory," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
The newly approved 1999 state budget includes 1,106.3 million
Cyprus pounds (about 2212.6 million U.S. dollars) of net revenue,
1,687.1 million pounds (about 3374.2 million dollars) of net
expenditure, and a fiscal deficit of 580.8 million pounds (about
1161.6 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
Christodoulou explained that the fiscal deficit is expected to
rise by 6.7 percent next year due primarily to the loss of some
295 million pounds (about 590 million dollars) in the past two
years in customs income because of the implementation of the
customs union agreement with the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
Referring to the value added tax (VAT), Christodoulou said the
VAT in EU member states must be at least 15 percent while Cyprus
currently is imposing a ceiling of 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
The VAT increase must be introduced gradually, he added.
</P>
<P>
The budget will be presented to the House of Representatives
for final approval by the end of this month.

<HEADLINE> Duma May Back Primakov's PM Candidacy Friday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Russia's State Duma, the lower
house of parliament, is expected to back acting Foreign Minister
Yevgeny Primakov's candidacy for prime minister in a hearing on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party, Agrarians and People's Power, three
leftist factions that compose the Duma's largest voting block,
will all vote in favor of the Kremlin's new choice to head the
Russian cabinet, the Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
The three groups compose 213 of the Duma's deputies. Primakov
needs to get 226 votes of support from parliament's 450 lawmakers
to win Friday's confirmation hearing.
</P>
<P>
Yevgeny Primakov, a career diplomat transferred from the press
whose service spanned the Soviet and Russian times, emerged as a
possible compromise candidate last week when leftists and liberals
in the opposition-dominated State Duma put his name forward.
</P>
<P>
The Duma had twice rejected acting Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin, Russian President Boris Yeltsin's first choice for
prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Following a meeting Thursday with Chernomyrdin and Yuri
Maslyukov, a Communist deputy in the Duma, Yeltsin sent a letter
to the Duma nominating acting Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov
for prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Russian Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov said: "Yevgeny
Primakov is a consolidating figure in the conditions where all is
heated to the limit."
</P>
<P>
He said that Primakov is a well-known politician in the
country and abroad, capable of pursuing and defending national
interests.
</P>
<P>
Leader of the liberal Yabloko movement Grigory Yavlinsky said
that Yeltsin's decision "will help stop the political crisis," and
that "it is the first instance when an open proposal was supported
by the president."
</P>
<P>
Leader of the Our Home is Russia faction Alexander Shokhin also
expressed support of Primakov's candidacy for prime minister,
calling him "an equally distant politician."
</P>
<P>
"Primakov is a politician equally distant from all political
forces, therefore he can be entrusted with forming a government,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, the only opposing voice came from the faction of the
Liberal Democratic Party of Russia (LDPR).
</P>
<P>
LDPR faction leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky told a press
conference that his party will vote against Primakov's candidacy
for prime minister.
</P>
<P>
He said Primakov would not be able to cope with the tasks which
would be assigned to him now in such a complex economic and social
situation.
</P>
<P>
The Primakov's government will be a "death squad" which will
act just for two months, he said.
</P>
<P>
"By supporting Yeltsin's nomination the Duma Communists will
give up on voting on non-confidence in the government and the
impeachment procedure against Yeltsin," he said. He warned that he
will raise the non-confidence issue in two months.
</P>
<P>
Born in Kiev on October 29, 1929, Primakov was graduated from
the Moscow Institute of Oriental Studies in 1953.
</P>
<P>
Once a correspondent for the national daily Pravda, an official
newspaper of the Soviet Communist Party Central Committee,
Primakov was appointed director of the Central Intelligence
Service of the Soviet Union on November 6, 1991. He has been
serving as Russian foreign minister since January 9, 1996.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Chief Asks for Mandate Extension for MONUA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 10 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan on Thursday put forward a proposal for the extension of
the mandate of the United Nations Observer Mission in Angola
(MONUA).
</P>
<P>
"I propose that the mandate of MONUA be extended until January
31, 1999." he said.
</P>
<P>
The proposal came as Annan presented to the Security Council
his report on the MONUA. The 15-member Security Council held
informal consultations here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
If the warring parties in Angola have made no "substantial
progress towards the full compliance" of the Lusaka Protocol by
November, the Security Council should "take the necessary action,"
and the reduction of the MONUA would be accelerated with a view to
closing it down by early February 1999, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, the MONUA would be allowed to carry out its mandate if
the concerned parties have made decisive progress by the end of
November, when the Security Council is expected to conduct a
comprehensive view on the situation in Angola before any relevant
decision, he added.
</P>
<P>
Annan produced his report following recent reports of renewed
armed clashes in the southern African nation. The Angolian
police force killed 27 UNITA fighters in several clashes with
the rebel faction.

<HEADLINE> Primakov Asserts Russian Status, Blasts NATO Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Russia's premier-designate
Yevgeny Primakov on Thursday reiterated Moscow's opposition to
NATO expansion, saying it could lead to new polarization and
dis-stabilize international relations.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the 100th Conference of the Inter-Parliamentary
Union, Primakov, speaking as foreign minister, said NATO
enlargement is threatening to erect new division lines in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Primakov was nominated prime minister by Russian President
Boris Yeltsin just hours before he delivered the address in the
Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
Participants to the 100th IPU Conference have withnessed their
hosts struggling against an economic and political crisis that
left the country without a fully functioning government for over
two weeks.
</P>
<P>
However, Primakov told the world parliamentarians that despite
the crisis, Russia remains a major player on the international
arena.
</P>
<P>
"Without active participation of Russia, even temporarily
feeble internally, it's not possible at all to address global
issues, to alleviate and eliminate threats which are still out
there," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Russia stands ready to present to the democratic and civilized
development of the world its entire foreign policy potentials,
especially its geo-political location and the influences
accumulated over the years and the status as a permanent member of
the U.N. Security Council," Primakov said.
</P>
<P>
He also noted Russia's scientific and technological potentials.
</P>
<P>
The IPU conference, which officially opened Monday, is
scheduled to be concluded Friday.

<HEADLINE> Iran Holds Taliban, Pakistan Responsible </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Iran stated on Thursday that
the Afghan Taliban militia and its supporter Pakistan are
responsible for the killing of Iranian diplomats in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
According to the state-run television, the Iranian Foreign
Ministry issued a statement after a Taliban spokesman announced
that the group has found the bodies of nine Iranian diplomats
missing since August 8.
</P>
<P>
The six-point statement said the Taliban and Pakistan had
offered assurance to Iran about the safety of Iranian diplomats
before the fall of Mazari Sharif, a town in northern Afghanistan,
to the hands of the Taliban on August 8.
</P>
<P>
Iran believed that 11 diplomats of the Iranian consulate in
Mazari Sharif and a reporter of the Iranian official news agency
IRNA were kidnaped by the Taliban and transferred to unknown place.
</P>
<P>
A Taliban spokesman announced on Thursday that bodies of nine
Iranian diplomats were found but the fate of two others were
unclear so far.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban is responsible to deliver the bodies of the killed
Iranian diplomats to Iran as soon as possible, the Iranian Foreign
Ministry statement said, adding the group is also responsible to
arrest and punish those who were responsible for the killing.
</P>
<P>
It also called on the Taliban to release all the Iranians who
were kidnaped by the Afghan group when they were on the duty to
dispatch humanitarian assistance to the Afghan people.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said that more than 80 Iranian truck drivers
and aid workers were held in prisons of the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
The statement also stressed that Iran has the right to defend
the rights of Iranian nation against foreign aggression and the
Taliban and their supporters should take responsibility for the
consequences of Taliban's behavior.
</P>
<P>
It also called the international community, the United Nations
in particular, to carry out their duty towards the Taliban's
crimes which were an obvious violation of international laws.
</P>
<P>
The statement came at a time when rumors widely spread here
that Iran, that has established its military buildup along its
border with Afghanistan, has been prepared to launch a military
strike on Taliban's targets.
</P>
<P>
Following the grand military maneuver of the Islamic
Revolutionary Guards Corps on the northeastern border early this
month, Iran's army on Thursday also announced to launch a large
war game along the eastern border with Afghanistan.

<HEADLINE> German FM: Primakov Deserves Trust </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, September 10 (Xinhua) -- German Foreign Minister Klaus
Kinkel Thursday expressed his support of Yevgeny Primakov's
nomination as Russia's new prime minister, saying "Primakov
deserves our trust."
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the German newspaper Suedwest Presse,
Kinkel said that Primakov "could be the man who would put the
relations among executive, parliament and regions in Russia in
order".
</P>
<P>
It would contribute to a stabilization in Russia and would
restore the lost trust if Primakov's nomination was confirmed by
the Russian State Duma, the lower house of parliament, Kinkel
added.
</P>
<P>
According to a German Foreign Ministry statement, Primakov made
a telephone call to Kinkel earlier Thursday during which he
assured that Russia would continue with reforms and would maintain
its course in foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
Kinkel meanwhile stressed that Germany would continue to
support Russia on the difficult path of its reform process.
</P>
<P>
He also said that Primakov could count on Germany as a close
partner.
</P>
<P>
German Chancellor Helmut Kohl has not given any comment on
Primakov's nomination so far.
</P>
<P>
According to German government spokesman Otto Hauser, Russian
President Boris Yeltsin informed Kohl of his decision on the new
prime minister nomination during their telephone talks Thursday
morning.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin assured Kohl that the new government would pursue the
policy of reforms and would do everything to bring the country's
economic development out of danger as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin's decision to submit a new prime minister candidate
averted a possible dissolution of the State Duma, which had
rejected twice the nomination of Viktor Chernomyrdin before.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Official Says Agreement Possible as Ross </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 10 (Xinhua) -- A senior Israeli official
said Thursday that an Israeli-Palestinian deal on the West Bank
redeployment is possible as U.S. envoy Dennis Ross continues his
mediation.
</P>
<P>
David Bar-Illan, media adviser to Netanyahu, said Ross'
decision to extend his stay here is a sign that positive results
could be produced. He believed that an agreement over the Israeli
redeployment could be reached during Ross' visit.
</P>
<P>
"We certainly hope so, and there is no reason we should not
(reach an agreement), particularly since Israel has agreed in
principle to consider the 13.1 percent withdrawal which is the
only requirement in the American initiative which applies to
Israel," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ross arrived here Wednesday afternoon on a renewed mission to
broker a deal between Israel and the Palestinians over the overdue
Israeli second stage troop redeployment in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Top on his agenda is the U.S. initiative put forward in January
that calls for a 13.1 percent Israeli withdrawal. The Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) has already adopted the plan, but Israel
originally rejected it, and then accepted it with certain
conditions.
</P>
<P>
Israel is demanding that the PNA agree to turn 3 percent of the
proposed land into a nature reserve where Israel retains full
security control and the Palestinians are not allowed to build.
</P>
<P>
The PNA reportedly only agreed to accept temporary limitations
and wanted to obtain an Israeli promise that the PNA could finally
gain total control over the designated area.
</P>
<P>
Ross has held talks with PNA President Yasser Arafat Wednesday
night in the West Bank city Ramallah and with Netanyahu and
Israeli President Ezer Weizman Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after meeting with Weizman, Ross said he found that
both Israel and the PNA are ready to find a way to move
forward. But he added that there are still many issues to be
sorted out.
</P>
<P>
Ross is expected to meet again with Netanyahu and senior
Israeli ministers within the Inner Cabinet on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Inner Cabinet, or Kitchen Cabinet, is in charge of the top
security issues in the Jewish state. Its members include
Netanyahu, Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai, National
Infrastructure Minister Ariel Sharon and Minister of Industry and
Trade Natan Sharansky.
</P>
<P>
Senior Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat reiterated Wednesday
night after the Arafat-Ross meeting that the PNA rejected the
Israeli changes to the U.S. initiative and is awaiting a positive
response by Israel.
</P>
<P>
But Bar-Illan urged the PNA to implement the requirements in
the U.S. proposal, including abolishing clauses in the Palestinian
Covenant calling for Israel's destruction and taking tougher
measures to fight terrorism.

<HEADLINE> 7 Defense Ministers Meet in Ethiopia on Congo (K) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Defense Ministers of
seven southern African countries met here Thursday afternoon
to discuss the conflict in Congo (K).
</P>
<P>
In his remarks made at the opening session, OAU Secretary
General Salim Ahmed Salim stated that he was pleased with the
spirit of the second Victoria Falls summit which stressed the
fact that whatever the cause of the present dispute in Congo, the
time is now propitious for its settlement.
</P>
<P>
''Such a settlement should be comprehensive enough to address
the legitimate concerns of all the parties involved and whose
paramount objective would be to end the conflict, to bring the
Congolese people together in peace, unity and cohesion and to
promote a climate of understanding, harmony and cooperation in
the region,'' Salim stressed.
</P>
<P>
Salim said, ''the Organization of African Unity (OAU), working
closely with the United Nations, will continue to do its utmost
to promote a peaceful solution to the conflict in the Democratic
Republic of Congo.''
</P>
<P>
''Indeed, we do attach the greatest important to the peace,
unity, stability and territorial integrity of the Democratic
Republic of Congo as we seek to promote conditions for durable
peace, unity and stability in the Great Lakes region,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
C.M. Sampa, Zambian Minister of Defense, said the second
Victoria Falls summit gave mandate this meeting to establish the
modalities for effecting an immediate cease-fire and a mechanism
for monitoring compliance with the cease-fire provisions,
especially those relating to the withdrawal of foreign forces
from Congo (K).
</P>
<P>
He explained that the mandate is threefold: to establish the
modalities for effecting an immediate cease-fire; to establish a
mechanism for monitoring compliance with the cease-fire
provisions; and the withdrawal of foreign forces from the
Democratic Republic of Congo.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the session, Berhanu Dinka, U.N. representative to
the Great Lakes region, assured U.N.'s continued concern and
commitment to assist in every possible way to contribute to the
success of efforts to restore peace and stability to Congo (K)
and to the region.
</P>
<P>
''The strong U.N. delegation to this meeting is a concrete
manifestation of that concern and commitment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Angolan Defense Minister Pedro Sebastiao, Namibian Minister of
Home Affairs Jerry Ekandjo, Rwandan Col. Frank Mugambage, Ugandan
Minister of State for Defense Steven Kavuma, Zimbabwean Defense
Minister Moven e. Mahachi and others attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Mahachi said here Thursday that Rwandan and Angolan
forces must withdraw from Democratic Congo first before
zimbabwean and other allied forces would leave the country.
</P>
<P>
''Who came first must go first,'' he noted.
</P>
<P>
Mahachi hoped that the defense ministers meeting would draw up
the mechanism for a cease-fire agreed in principle at the second
Victoria Falls summit in Zimbabwe earlier this week.

<HEADLINE> Iran Holds Taliban, Pakistan Responsible for Killing Diplomats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Iran has held the Afghan
Taliban army and its supporter Pakistan responsible for the
killing of Iranian diplomats in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
In a strong-worded statement, the Iranian Foreign Ministry said
Taliban and its supporters should "take responsibility for the
consequences" of the killing.
</P>
<P>
A Taliban spokesman announced earlier on Thursday that bodies
of nine Iranian diplomats were found but the fate of two others
were unclear so far.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei
announced a three-day mourning for the killed diplomats.
</P>
<P>
The state-run television said in a brief report that the
public mourning would start on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The statement also stressed that Iran has the right to defend
the rights of Iranian nation against foreign aggression.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Apologizes to Democratic Leaders in Senate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 10 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill
Clinton apologized over the Monica Lewinsky affair in private to
Senate Democratic leaders on Thursday. He also summoned his
Cabinet members to the White House for a similar session.
</P>
<P>
"He shared his feelings and apologized to us personally,"
Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota told reporters
after the meeting in the White House residence.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said later his talk with the senators had been "a part
of this process I'm going through of talking to people... to ask
for their understanding, their forgiveness and their commitment
not to let the events of the moment in Washington deter us from
doing the people's work here." He spoke during a science awards
ceremony in the Roosevelt Room.
</P>
<P>
Daschle said the lawmakers accepted the president's apology but
also asked him whether there were new, damaging revelations yet to
surface.
</P>
<P>
"His answer was that, no, there were no surprises," Daschle
said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton scheduled a late-afternoon meeting with members of his
Cabinet -- the first since January 23, when Clinton assured them
that reports he had a sexual affair with the former White House
intern were false.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Attorney General Janet Reno reaffirmed her
confidence in Clinton.
</P>
<P>
"There are so many factors that indicate that he has had the
ability to address issues in a comprehensive way that can truly
make a difference," she said at her weekly news conference.
</P>
<P>
The Senate allies advised the president to keep up his campaign
of personal penance to save his presidency.
</P>
<P>
"We have expressed the hope that the president will continue to
demonstrate his contrition to his family, his friends and to the
American people," Daschle told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The senator added that he believed the president would survive
this political crisis.
</P>
<P>
Daschle appealed for fairness on Capitol Hill as the House of
Representatives prepares for possible impeachment proceedings.
</P>
<P>
"The president's story needs to be heard and we need to get the
facts," Daschle said.
</P>
<P>
Daschle said Vice President Al Gore also attended the meeting,
which did not touch on the subject of a possible Clinton
resignation.
</P>
<P>
He said the senators "expressed the need to bring this to a
closure, to allow this country to heal, to allow us to work on the
nation's business."
</P>
<P>
Clinton returned to Washington D.C. early Thursday morning from
Florida, where he pleaded with Democratic party faithfuls for
forgiveness on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday before flying to Florida, Clinton met with House
Democratic leaders, who later described the president as
apologetic and determined to keep the country focused on issues he
deems most important, such as education and health care.
</P>
<P>
Even Democrats who have been among Clinton's biggest supporters
are expressing outrage at his handling of the Lewinsky affair.
</P>
<P>
Several Republican members of Congress have called for
Clinton's resignation. Senator Sam Brownback of Kansas, asserted
Thursday that Clinton's ability to lead has been all but destroyed
and his actions have been "corrosive to our national character and
debased the office of the presidency."

<HEADLINE> Campaign Finance Bill Heads for Defeat Despite Majority </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Legislation to overhaul
campaign finance rules suffered another blow in the U.S. Senate
Thursday despite support from a majority of senators.
</P>
<P>
The Senate voted 52-48 to cut off debate and move to a final
decision on the bipartisan campaign finance measure authored by
Senators John McCain, a Republican, and Russ Feingold, a Democrat,
The vote was eight short of the 60 needed to overcome that
legislative hurdle.
</P>
<P>
Seven Republicans joined all 45 Democrats in voting to close
off debate. Supporters promised to try again before this session
of Congress ends, but the odds of overcoming the opposition led by
the Republican leadership appeared unlikely.
</P>
<P>
The Senate abandoned the McCain-Feingold bill last February
after failing to get those 60 votes by the same margin as on
Thursday's vote. The issue appeared dead for the year until last
month when House supporters of similar legislation, after months
of battling Republican leadership opposition, pushed their bill to
passage.
</P>
<P>
Feingold said his side had revived the issue after the House of
Representatives vote because "we owe it here in this body to the
American people to finish the job."
</P>
<P>
Both McCain-Feingold bill and the House bill, sponsored by
Representatives Christopher Shays, a Republican, and Marty Meehan,
a Democrat, would ban "soft money" -- unlimited and unregulated
donations to political parties. They also regulate issue ads that
purport to educate voters but are often used to influence
elections, and expand disclosure requirements.
</P>
<P>
Opponents argue that the bills are an unconstitutional assault
on free-speech rights and that the focus should be on
investigating campaign finance violations from the 1996 election
rather than making new laws.
</P>
<P>
Prevented from offering the measure independently, supporters
attached it as an amendment to an Interior Department spending
bill that must be approved before the new fiscal year begins
October 1.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Considering Additional Food Aid to DPRK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The United States is
considering the possibility of providing an additional 300,000
tons of food aid to the Democratict People's Republic of Korea
(DPRK) after reaching some agreements during last week's U.S.-DPRK
talks in New York, the State Department said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Rubin told reporters that
Washington would make good on promised fuel oil deliveries to the
DPRK in return for Pyongyang agreeing to resume missile talks and
previous obligations to freeze its nuclear program.
</P>
<P>
He said these were among the terms of an agreement reached
between the two government during talks last week in New York.
</P>
<P>
Rubin confirmed that the United States was considering new
humanitarian food aid to the DPRK. Other officials said the
donation would be in the area of 300,000 tons of food, but Rubin
said no decision had been made.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said the United states guaranteed the DPRK that it will
provide a promised 284,000 tons of heavy fuel oil this year and
added that the administration was confident, after talks with
Congress, that this pledge can be honored.

<HEADLINE> UK Bank Leaves Interest Rate Unchanged Despite Calls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of England's Monetary
Policy Committee (MPC) has decided to leave interest rates on hold
at 7.5 percent, despite calls from the industry for a rate cut to
save it from recession.
</P>
<P>
Experts in London's financial city had predicted the decision,
believing that the MPC was still too worried about the risk of
inflation to heed calls for a rate cut.
</P>
<P>
But a surprise rate cut in Japan on Wednesday, and hints over
the weekend that the US central bank might be loosening its
anti-inflationary stance, led to optimism that rates in the UK
would have to come down fairly soon.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturers say the strong pound is at the root of their
woes. Jeremy Batstone, analyst at NatWest Stockbrokers, said it
was likely that the MPC would wait another month before cutting
rates.
</P>
<P>
But he said the longer rates stayed at their current level, the
sharper they would fall when the cuts were announced.
</P>
<P>
Since taking over power of setting the cost of borrowing in
June last year, the MPC has increased interest rates five times -
from 6.25 percent to 7.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Dr Ian Peters, Deputy Director-General of the British Chambers
of Commerce said the decision was "bitterly disappointing" for
businesses that had hoped for a rate cut to ensure the pound's
downward trend was sustained.
</P>
<P>
"Our concern is that business will have to continue to endure
the slow torture caused by the combination of high interest rates,
a strong pound and economic turmoil abroad," he said.
</P>
<P>
The decision comes on the day that the Confederation of British
Industry said High Street sales growth came to a standstill last
month for the first time in almost three years.
</P>
<P>
Retailers have had to slash prices during the summer sales to
attract shoppers worried by job cuts across the country.
</P>
<P>
Fears are now rising that the UK economy is poised for
recession. Manufacturing confidence in the Midlands region - the
heart of UK manufacturing - is at a record low, the Birmingham
Chamber of Commerce and Industry said on Wednesday.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Greek Foreign Minister
Theodoros Pangalos on Thursday met with U.S. State Department
special coordinator for the Cyprus problem Thomas Miller.
</P>
<P>
The two men discussed the Cyprus problem, but no statements or
press release were made after their talks, the semi-official
Athens News Agency (ANA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Miller's visit to Greece was postponed two months ago when
Pangalos refused to meet him following statements in the press by
a U.S. official on Miller's mission.
</P>
<P>
While making it clear that the Cyprus problem remained the
issue of invasion and occupation by Turkey to a free state, Greece
and Cyprus refused to focus the talks on the Russian-made S-300
anti-aircraft missiles, which were due to be deployed on Cyprus
later this year.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources here said that Athens was waiting for U.S.
proposals focusing on the political side of the Cyprus problem,
which will create the conditions for the resumption of
inter-communal talks on the divided island, based on the United
Nations Security Council's resolution.

<HEADLINE> SADC Countries Face Serious Food Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GRAND BAIE, Mauritius, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The Southern
African Development Community (SADC) countries are facing serious
food problems with a forcast decline of about six percent in
maize harvest of 16.10 million tons this year against last year's
17.07 million tons.
</P>
<P>
A SADC official in charge of food security told reporters here
Thursday that current food problems are a result of erratic and
below normal rainfall in some of the southern countries as
against excessive rains and flooding in other parts of the region
such as Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Latest production estimates for the 1997/98 cereal harvest put
total production at 20.98 million tons against 22.38 million tons
in last season.
</P>
<P>
The decline was occasioned by the poor rainfall season in many
SADC countries including South Africa, Namibia, Lesotho, Zambia
and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
The SADC also faces an overall cereal deficit of 510,000 tons
for the 1998/1999 marketing year, he said, adding that the total
cereal availability of 25.71 million tons is insufficient to
cover total requirements estimated at 26.22 million tons.
</P>
<P>
The official cited large regional deficits in wheat and
sorghum as the cause of overall shortfall in the region.
</P>
<P>
As wheat is not easily substituted by other grains, the region
may have to import 1.35 million tons of wheat during the 1998/99
marketing year to cover the deficit.
</P>
<P>
Only maize is assessed as showing a regional surplus of 1.22
million tons, which according to him, is mostly due to high
carry-over stocks in South Africa. The surpluses are assessed for
South Africa, Mozambique, Swaziland and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Recent reports indicate that Namibia has issued
a 6-million-U.S. Dollar appeal for international assistance due to
poor harvests in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The food aid will cater for the emergency needs of 160,000
people in the north badly devastated by drought.
</P>
<P>
A crippling drought in southern Angola has prompted the
government to call for humanitarian assistance. Humanitarian
sources have indicated that more than 220,000 people in two of
Angola's provinces are at risk, having lost entire crops to the
El Nino-related drought.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the recent re-capture of government-held towns
in eastern Moxico Province by the opposition National Union for
the Total Independence of Angola and increased hostilities in
the country may lead to increased movement of people seeking
refuge who will require food relief.
</P>
<P>
The grim food situation in the southern African region will be
reviewed by the 14 heads of state and government during their
summit scheduled for September 13 and 14.

RAMALLAH -- The Palestinians have expressed objection to any
changes in a reported United States proposal on Israel's further
withdrawal from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
"Any attempt to fragment the American package will only
complicate matters," senior Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat
told reporters Wednesday night after a meeting between Palestinian
National Authority President Yasser Arafat and U.S. Mideast envoy
Dennis Ross.
</P>
<P>
Erekat stressed that the Palestinians "will not allow such
act," adding that they are still waiting for a positive Israeli
response to the U.S. plan.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has called on Israel to withdraw from a further 13
percent of the West Bank. The Palestinians have accepted the
initiative, but Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu balked
at it. (BC-Palestine-Ross-Peace Process)

TEHRAN -- Amid growing tension between Tehran and the Afghan

grand maneuver on the country's eastern border in the near future.

<P>
"The annual Zolfaqar military maneuver will be carried out soon
in the eastern border areas," the army's chief of staff Ali
Shahbazi announced to the official news agency IRNA.
</P>
<P>
Shahbazi did not mention the date and place of the maneuver,
but said that the maneuver would be unprecedented in terms of its
scope and variety of operations.

He said that the order for the maneuver has been issued and the
necessary forces have been stationed in the region during the past

JERUSALEM -- The number of Palestinians supporting the peace
process and the Oslo Accords declined, said a public opinion poll
released here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The poll, conducted by the Jerusalem Media and Communication
Center (JMCC) by the end of August, said the decline in support
shown this year is a departure from the first four years of Oslo,
when the Palestinian public showed consistent support for the
Palestinian-Israeli peace process despite sudden and dramatic
political and economic changes.
</P>
<P>
The negative trend can be measured through three main
indicators of the poll: support for Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat, his faction Fatah and the peace process itself.

JERUSALEM -- A senior Israeli official said Thursday that an

decision to extend his stay here is a sign that positive results
could be produced. He believed that an agreement over the Israeli
redeployment could be reached during Ross' visit.
</P>
<P>
"We certainly hope so, and there is no reason we should not
(reach an agreement), particularly since Israel has agreed in
principle to consider the 13.1 percent withdrawal which is the
only requirement in the American initiative which applies to
Israel," he said. (BC-Israel-Palestine-Agreement)

<HEADLINE> UN Court Deputy Registrar Dies of Illness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The deputy registrar
of the United Nations court on Rwanda, Imelda Perry, died
Wednesday following a short illness, at the age of 51.
</P>
<P>
She died in the United States where she reportedly went for
medical treatment in early August, said Agwu Okali, registrar of
the Arusha-based International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda
(ICTR).
</P>
<P>
According to a news dispatch Thursday from Arusha in north
Tanzania, the registrar described Perry as a hardworking,
intelligent person, whose sudden death would cause a gap in the
tribunal's operations.
</P>
<P>
Perry, who joined the ICTR in March this year fit her position
so well that her absence "will be a big loss to the UN court,"
Okali told his staff Wednesday when announcing the death of
Perry.
</P>
<P>
The ICTR is the first international body charged specifically
with prosecuting crimes of genocide in Rwanda. The court was
created by the UN Security Council in November of 1994 after one
of the intense periods of mass exterminations in human history.
</P>
<P>
At least 500,000 people, primarily Tutsis and moderate Hutus,
were massacred by Hutu extremists in Rwanda in just three months
in the middle of that year.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the UN court made landmark decisions by sentencing
Rwandan former Prime Minister Jean Kambanda life imprisonment for
six counts of genocide and crimes against humanity and finding
former Taba mayor Jean-Paul Akayesu guilty of genocide and crimes
against humanity.
</P>
<P>
From 1989 to 1995, Perry worked as a trial attorney in a civil
litigation law firm appearing in state and federal courts in the
five boroughs of New York.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, she joined the United Nations Civilian Mission in
Haiti and worked extensively in the field prior to being
appointed as co-ordinator and legal officer of a regional office
and subsequently as desk officer and member of the four-person
co-ordination, analysis and reports unit of the mission.
</P>
<P>
Okali said that Perry will be given a befitting funeral in her
town of Saint Lucia.

<HEADLINE> War Against Kabila Will Continue: DRC Rebel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Spokesman of the rebel
forces in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) Thursday
expressed the determination to continue their fighting against
President Laurent Kabila.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference in Midrand, north of
Johannesburg, rebel spokesman Thomas Timana accused Kabila of
being a "nepotic tribalist" who had betrayed the Alliance of
Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo/Zaire (AFDL).
</P>
<P>
The AFDL ousted Zaire president Mobutu Sese Seko in May last
year.
</P>
<P>
Timana said Kabila was only the spokesman of the AFDL when he
declared himself president of the newly-named Democratic Republic
of the Congo.
</P>
<P>
He said armed struggle was the only avenue available because
Kabila had become a dictator who jailed or dismissed anyone who
opposed him.
</P>
<P>
The rebel movement, which calls itself the Congolese Coalition
for Democracy (RCD), was formed on August 1 this year in the
eastern DRC town of Goma.
</P>
<P>
"The RCD is a structure of political and military actions
aimed at dismantling the dictatorial regime of Mr. Kabila and
establishing a democratic regime based on real popular
legitimacy," Timana said.

<P>
Among the major issues to be discussed are sectoral progress
reports, update on protocol development and ratification,
recommendations on the Review and Rationalization of SADC Program
of Action as well as preparation for the summit agenda.

Council of Ministers urged members to speed up their pace in
ratifying the Trade Protocol, which seeks to lay the foundation
for a future economic union by establishing a SADC free-trade
area within eight years following the protocol's entry into

</P>
<P>
"There are many more issues of pressing urgency that this
Council will have to deal with including the prevailing food
security situation in the region, promotion of trade and
investment in the current economic climate, facilitation of
movement of people in the Community as well as timely
implementation of the SADC Gender," he said.

NAIROBI, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The European Union has
expressed great concern about the on-going crisis in the
Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and is working for resolving
the crisis through peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
"We are very much worried about what is going on in the Congo,
and we are trying to support as much as we can all the
initiatives which are in the direction of cease-fire, peace, and
negotiations," the EU Special Envoy to the Great Lakes, Aldo
Ajello, said upon his arrival in Rwanda Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
Ajello was at the second leg of his African tour, trying to
get the understanding of the Congolese issue, reported the Rwanda
News Agency.
</P>
<P>
He had been in Addis-Ababa where he met the Organisation of
African Unity officials.
</P>
<P>
He said that he hoped to meet Rwandan government officials,
before his trip to Uganda to meet President Yoweri Museveni.
</P>
<P>
Ajello will also meet the embattled Congolese President,
Laurent Desire Kabila, before flying to New York to meet the
United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
The EU is ready to support an inter-African force to monitor
the cease-fire as suggested by the OAU, and which should not
include Congo's neighbors, Ajello said.
</P>
<P>
He made it clear that EU would support financially that force,
that would work at creating conditions conducive to peace.
</P>
<P>
Ajello expressed great worries about the rising tides of
genocide and ethnic hate in the Great Lakes region which are
causing enormous suffering to the civilian populations.

LUANDA, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Some generals from the

(UNITA) issued a communique here Thursday, Calling on UNITA
soldiers to lay down their arms and give up war.
</P>
<P>
The communique, read by Demostene Amos Chillingutila, former

The communique said that the war could only bring suffering

As any other political force, UNITA should be a law-observing
civilian party, the communique noted.
</P>
<P>
It urged UNITA soldiers to stand by the side of the national
unity and reconciliation government of Angola.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Iranian Army Deployed on Eastern Border </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Iran has deployed its army
along 700 kilometers of the country's eastern border in rising
tension between Tehran and the Afghan Taliban militia, a general
announced on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Chief of the Joint Staff Command of the Armed Forces Ali
Shahbazi told reporters here that the army's troops were deployed
during the past month to follow the development beyond the border
and to strongly react to any aggression.
</P>
<P>
However, he did not mention how many troops have been sent to
the border with Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The army's deployment came after the Islamic Revolutionary
Guards Corps (IRGC) built up 70,000 troops on the northeastern
border with Afghanistan following a military maneuver early this
month in the northeastern province of Khorasan.
</P>
<P>
The chief of staff announced that the army will also launch a
grand maneuver in the near future along the eastern border in
Khorasan and the southeastern province of Sistan-Baluchestan.
</P>
<P>
Without giving the date of the maneuver, Shahbazi said that
the maneuver will be held with participation of ground forces,
armored, mechanized units with the support of the army's air
forces.
</P>
<P>
He said that new equipment will be tested in the maneuver and
modern bombers, advanced radar and communication system, a large
amount of tanks, and artillery will be used in the maneuver.
</P>
<P>
Shahbazi noted that the military exercises are aimed at
promoting the army's defensive capabilities against any possible
threat considering the insecurity and instability in the
neighboring Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The war games show that Iran will not tolerate any threat,
insecurity and drug smuggling in the border areas.
</P>
<P>
He criticized the United States for expressing concern on
Iran's military buildup on the eastern border, saying that the
perseverance of peace and security in the region is against the
interests of the U.S. because it will not have pretext to keep its
forces in the region.
</P>
<P>
Rumors widely spread here said that Tehran has been prepared to
launch a military strike on the Taliban's targets as the Taliban
has confirmed the death of missing Iranian diplomats.
</P>
<P>
Iran earlier said that the Taliban forces kidnaped 11 Iranian
diplomats and a correspondent of the official news agency IRNA in
Mazari Sharif in northern Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
A Taliban spokesman announced on Thursday that the bodies of
nine Iranian diplomats have been found.
</P>
<P>
In a swift reaction, the Iranian Foreign Ministry stated that
Iran holds the Taliban and Pakistan responsible for the killing of
the Iranian diplomats in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
It also announced that Iran has the right to defend the
rights of Iranian nation against foreign aggression and the
Taliban and their supporters should bear the responsibility for
the consequences of Taliban's behavior.

<TEXT>
<P>
GRAND BAIE, Mauritius, September 10 (Xinhua) -- A Mauritian senior
minister Thursday stressed on the importance of sound monetary, fiscal
and exchange rate policies to achieve macro-economic stability in the
southern African region.
</P>
<P>
A stable macro-economic framework is critical, over the long run,
for achieving the broad-based growth that is necessary to alleviate
poverty and combat underdevelopment, Rundheersing Bheenick, Mauritian
Minister of Economic Development and Regional Cooperation, told the
Council of Ministers meeting of the Southern African Development
Community (SADC) at its opening session.
</P>
<P>
He said that the average growth rate in the sub-region is a
growing one which recorded at 4.4 percent in 1997, and 6.5
percent in 1996. The Gross Domestic Product of SADC was over 167
billion U.S. Dollars in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Significant progress has been noted in Angola, Botswana, Malawi and
Mozambique, which on average has grown by 6.5 percent in 1997. Other
members also registered quite satisfactory growth rates, he added.
</P>
<P>
Foreign direct investment in the southern African region which has
a total population of 185 million is steadily increasing in Malawi,
Tanzania and Zambia.
</P>
<P>
Inflation in 1996 was in single digit figure in Botswana,
Lesotho, Mauritius, Namibia and South Africa.
</P>

"The task now is to spread the success more widely through
systematic pursuit of the development agenda, taking into
consideration specific country circumstances," he noted.
</P>
<P>
There is also an urgent need to reduce the costs of doing business
in southern Africa and to maximize productivity of resources, he said,
adding that market reforms have to be implemented to free up the
energies of the private sectors.
</P>
<P>
The SADC countries have signed protocols in key areas such as
trade, transport, energy, shared water courses and combating illicit
drugs since the organization was founded in 1992.
</P>
<P>
The Trade Protocol which lays foundation for a future economic
union by establishing a SADC free trade area in eight years
following its entry into force has so far been ratified by
Zimbabwe, Mauritius, Botswana and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
However, the protocol has to be ratified by two-thirds of the
members before its entry into force. Therefore, countries are urged
to speed up their process of ratifying it so that the regional economy
could benefit from it.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Moves Troops to Disputed Bakassi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria says it has moved more
troops and equipment into the disputed Bakassi Penninsula, two
days after it accused Cameroon of deploying more troops there.
</P>
<P>
The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) quoted a defense
spokesman as saying Thursday in Lagos that there had been no
incidents yet, but Nigeria did not want to be caught off guard.
</P>
<P>
The Defense Headquarters said in a statement Tuesday that
authorities in Yaounde had as at last week deployed more troops
to the disputed areas along its border with Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Cameroon has not commented on the Nigerian accusation.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria and Cameroon have clashed for several times in the
last few years at Bakassi, a peninsula in the Guinea Gulf in West
Africa.
</P>
<P>
The dispute was filed to the International Court of Justice in
1994 but the judgement is still being expected.

<HEADLINE> European Stock Markets Fall Sharply with Wall Street </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Growing concern over the
political situation in the United States hit Wall Street stocks
hard, which in turn sent European stock markets even deeper into
the red.
</P>
<P>
Shares on the London stock market were hit after an early slump
on Wall Street turned traders' screens into a sea of red.
</P>
<P>
The prospect of U.S. President Bill Clinton facing impeachment
proceedings sparked a similar tumble in London, which closed just
short of the days low. By the end of trading, the FTSE 100 Index
of leading shares was down 174.7 points at 5,136.6, wiping 30
billion pounds or 48 billion U.S. dollars off share prices.
</P>
<P>
This was also helped by the Bank of England's Monetary Policy
Committee's decision to keep interest rates unchanged at 7.5
percent. Manufacturers had been hoping for a fall.
</P>
<P>
Financial stocks led the market down with insurance companies
taking massive hits. But the prospect of more football teams being
taken over by media groups sent shares in several top clubs
rising.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, heavy opening losses on Wall Street and the
dollar's slump below the 1.70 Deutschmark level sparked another
slump in German stocks, too. The leading Dax index fell 293 points
to close at 4747, shedding 5.8 percent of its value.
</P>
<P>
In Paris, the French stock market extended early losses to
trade at session lows, following another severe tumble on Wall
Street. The leading Cac-40 index closed down 172 points at 3589, a
drop of 4.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the banking sector had led the declines, as investors
fretted about the large provisions French banks set aside in the
first half to cover risk in Russia and Asia.
</P>
<P>
Wall Street's sharp pullback yesterday, although partly
anticipated, also weighed on sentiment, according to market
analysts.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Warns to Use Force Over Eritrea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian President
Negasso Gidada Thursday warned that Ethiopia will use force
unless Eritrea unconditionally withdraws its troops from the
areas it forcibly occupied in May this year.
</P>
<P>
In his New Year message, President Negasso said: "Defending
the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the country will be
the major pre-occupation of the people and government of Ethiopia
in 1991 Ethiopian calendar.''
</P>
<P>
The 1991 Ethiopian calendar starts from September 11.
</P>
<P>
Negasso was quoted by the Ethiopia News Agency as saying,"The
use of force will come at the time when the government believes
is right and the chances for the peaceful settlement of the
crisis are fully exhausted."
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Ministerial Committee of the Organization of
African Unity (OAU) confirmed that Badme has always been part of
Ethiopia and the cause of the crisis is the invasion by Asmara.
</P>
<P>
"We are now awaiting the decision of the leaders of the OAU,"
the Ethiopian president said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to economic development in the country, Negasso said
encouraging achievements have been made in the economic, social
and political fields.
</P>
<P>
"Measures taken to ensure food self-sufficiency and food
security are bearing fruit and the extension program gathering
momentum," he said.
</P>
<P>
Agricultural production in the coming new Ethiopian year is
expected to rise because of the prevailing suitable weather
condition, according to the president.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in his new year message to the Ethiopian army,
Chief of Staff Tsadkan Gebre-Tensay said Thursday the Ethiopian
army will emerge victorious discharging the responsibility vested
in it to evict the Eritrean forces that violated the sovereignty
and territorial integrity of the country.
</P>
<P>
The army has drawn strategy which will enable it to decisively
crush the invading Eritrean force, he said.

<HEADLINE> Military Coup Attempt Foiled in Malawi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Malawi has foiled a military coup
attempt last week and arrested 15 soldiers alledgedly in connection
with the plot, Deutsche Presse-Agentur DPA reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
DAP quoted a Malawian Army spokesman as saying that the arrests
were conducted at the weekend in the capital city of Lilongwe.
</P>
<P>
A group of soldiers planned a military takeover when President
Bakili Muluzi was attending the 12th Non-Aligned Movement ending last
Thursday in Durban, South Afica.
</P>
<P>
He said the the coup attempt failed due to bad coordination and
logistics problems.
</P>
<P>
DPA also quoted the State House spokesman as saying that the
soldiers arrested for breach of army discipline.
</P>
<P>
Army sources said there has been tension in the army following the
fall of the Malawian Kwacha, the local currency. The currency dropped
3.5 percent on
August 1 and a further fall occurred later, leading sharp hike in
prices.
</P>
<P>
The continuous depreciation of the Kwacha caused mainly by Malawi's
considerable descrease in tobacco exports in the past months and its
low price in the world market. Tobacco has been Malawi's traditional
foreign exchange earner.

<P>
ATHENS, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Greek Prime Minister Costas
Simitis described Friday the development in an international
financial crisis as "unpredictable", saying that his country would
take all necessary measures to deal with the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a cabinet meeting, Simitis urged the Greek
government ministers to remain alert because the financial crisis'
development would be unpredictable, the semi-official Athens News
Agency (ANA) reported.
</P>
<P>
While stressing that the Greek government would not impose new
taxes, he said that the impact of an international crisis on Greek
economy now had proved that Greece was no longer a developing but
a European country.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to drachma's entry into the European exchange
rate mechanism (ERM) in March this year. Greece has said that such
a move has strengthened the country's economy and is working as a
shield against the current crisis.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Welcomes Clinton's Statements on Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus Friday welcomed
statements made by the United States President Bill Clinton that
his administration is working to help establish a bizonal and
bicommunal federation in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
"We are satisfied when any U.N. Security Council member, and
especially a permanent member, remains firm on a bizonal,
bicommunal federation in Cyprus," government spokesman Christos
Stylianides told a press briefing.
</P>
<P>
Receiving the credentials of Cyprus' new ambassador to the
U.S. on Thursday, Clinton said that any solution to the Cyprus
issue should be "based on a bizonal, bicommunal federal framework
under U.N. auspices."
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot government "is trying to achieve a more forceful
stance from the international community and especially the five
permanent members of the (United Nations) Security Council, toward
the new Turkish effort to change the basis of the peace talks,"
the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's remarks came a few days after Turkish Cypriot leader
Rauf Denktash proposed the establishment of a confederation of
"two equal and sovereign states" on the eastern Mediterranean
island. The Cypriot government has rejected the proposal.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third of the island after a
failed coup by the Greek Cypriots seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots unilaterally declared in 1983 the
breakaway "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus" recognized only by
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The world community has been trying to help reunify Cyprus
under the U.N. bi-zonal and by-communal formula. But no tangible
results have been achieved.

<P>
"I am willing to make joint efforts with you to push further

WASHINGTON, September 11 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton, in
a speech to dozens of religious leaders Friday, included Monica
Lewinsky in his statement of regret for having an improper
relationship and lying about it.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there is a fancy way to say that I have sinned,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
This was the first time he had included a direct mention of
Lewinsky, the former White House intern.

"It is important to me that everybody who has been hurt know
that the sorrow that I feel is genuine -- first and most important
my family, also my friends, my staff my cabinet, Monica Lewinsky
and her family and the American people.
</P>
<P>
"I have asked all for their forgiveness. But I believe to be
forgiven, more than sorrow is required," he said.
</P>
<P>
The president said he had a broken spirit but hope that he
could redeem the nation's trust.
</P>
<P>
"If my repentance is genuine and sustained, and if I can
maintain both a broken spirit and a strong heart then good can
come of this for our country as well as for me and my family," he
said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Producer Prices Fall in August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The producer prices
charged by factories and farms dropped 0.4 percent in August, due
largely to deflation in gasoline, automobiles and vegetables, the
Labor Department said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The seasonally adjusted decline in the Producer Price Index,
was the largest since January this year and exceeded analysts'
expectation for a slight 0.1 percent drop, according to the
department.
</P>
<P>
For the first eight months of the year, producer prices have
fallen at a 1.4 percent annual rate, compared with a 1.2 percent
drop for all of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Much of the decline has come in energy costs, down 8.5 percent
in August and at a 14.8 percent annual rate so far this year. But
food costs also have fallen, 0.4 percent last month and at an 0.3
percent rate so far this year.
</P>
<P>
The department said "core" producer-price inflation, which
excludes the volatile food and energy components, has been
contained. Those prices edged 0.1 percent lower in August and, for
the first eight months of the year, have risen at just a 1.2
percent annual rate.
</P>
<P>
August's price drop was propelled by an 8.5 percent decline in
gasoline, the largest for a single month since 1991. That brought
the price 30.1 percent lower than a year ago. The cost of
home-heating oil and residential electricity also fell, but
natural gas costs rose 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Food prices fell 0.4 percent in August, with vegetable costs
plunging 20.6 percent. The cost of both tomatoes and onions was
cut nearly in half. Fruit, however, cost 1.7 percent higher.
</P>
<P>
Passenger car prices declined 1.7 percent in August with
General Motors production returning following a nearly two-month
strike. Computer prices continued to drop, 4.5 percent last month.
</P>
<P>
After a series of sharp increases, prescription drug costs fell
0.6 percent, but were still 21.3 percent higher than a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Tobacco increased 2.8 percent, and was 15.6 percent above a
year earlier, as companies continue their push to recover the cost
of multimillion-dollar liability lawsuits over smoking-related
deaths.
</P>
<P>
Children's clothing shot up 5.2 percent, rebounding from a 4.5
percent drop the month before. But women's and men's clothing
slipped 0.1 percent.

<HEADLINE> Six Northern Ireland Prisoners Win Early Release </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Six Irish guerilla fighters
who won early release from jail walked out of Maize Prison near
Belfast on Friday under the province's peace deal.
</P>
<P>
Three of them are Roman Catholics who sought to end British
rule of Northern Ireland, while the other three are Protestants
who fought to prolong it, according to reports from Belfast.
</P>
<P>
The prisoners were freed under the peace deal signed in April
because of their allegiance to political parties who helped
negotiate it.
</P>
<P>
About 400 prisoners are expected to be released within two
years in Northern Ireland, about half of them by Christmas.
</P>
<P>
They were all convicted by so-called "diplock" courts, with
a single judge and no jury, which were set up under emergency
provisions imposed during the conflict, in which more than 3,600
people were killed.
</P>
<P>
A seventh man will be released soon. He is not aligned to any
armed group and was sentenced under special emergency provisions
imposed by Britain in Northern Ireland, and therefore qualified
for early release.

<HEADLINE> Candidate Countries Per Capita GDP 40 Percent of EU Average </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The average real gross
domestic product (GDP) per person last year in countries applying
for European Union membership was 40 percent of the EU average.
</P>
<P>
The per-capita GDP in the candidate countries, however, saw an
increase of two percentage points since 1995, Eurostat, the
Luxembourg-based statistical bureau of the European Community said
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
According to its report, the candidate countries, excluding
Cyprus, averaged 7,500 current-price purchasing power standards
(PPS) for each person while EU member states averaged 19,000 PPS
per person.
</P>
<P>
PPS is an artificial currency used to remove the effect of
price differences between countries.
</P>
<P>
Slovenia had the highest per-capita PPS of 13,000 among the
candidate countries, while Greece -- with 13,100 PPS -- had the
lowest figure among the EU member states.
</P>
<P>
Candidate country Bulgaria had the lowest figure of 4,400 PPS,
while Luxembourg had the highest for the EU at 31,500 PPS.
</P>
<P>
Of the 10 candidate countries from central and eastern Europe,
Bulgaria and Romania posted decreases of real GDP in the past
year, while Poland, Slovakia, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Slovenia,
Lithuania, and the Czech Republic registered increases from one to
five percentage points during the same time.

<HEADLINE> State Urged to Prevent Epidemics After Flooding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Chinese authorities have
urged the nation to take emergency measures to prevent the spread
of epidemics after this summer's raging floods.
</P>
<P>
A notice issued by the General Offices of the Chinese Communist
Party Central Committee and the State Council states that the
floods have affected vast regions and more than 200 million
people, which increases the chances for epidemics in the flooded
areas.
</P>
<P>
The coming months will be critical for the country to provide
medical services to prevent diseases, the notice states, adding
that Party committees and governments at various levels must be
aware of the serious situation.
</P>
<P>
"Leading officials must adopt a responsibility system to ensure
that there are no serious diseases after the big disaster through
strict vigilance and by defending to the last," according to the
notice.
</P>
<P>
The notice urges strengthening the work of monitoring, analysis
and forecast, as well as alert to the plague and cholera. More
technicians should be sent to the flooded areas to disinfect areas
and kill mice, the notice states.
</P>
<P>
Water and food sanitation must be guaranteed, and rotten plants
and animal corpses must be properly disposed.
</P>
<P>
In addition, there should be a publicity campaign in the media
to arouse people's attention, the notice states, adding that
publishing houses will print a large number of medical handbooks
for the flood victims and that disease-prevention courses will be
open in primary and secondary schools.
</P>
<P>
It concludes that the governments should provide necessary
equipment and sufficient funding for the campaign.

<HEADLINE> Investigation Starts into Passenger Jet's Emergency Landing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, September 11 (Xinhua) -- A team of experts arrived in
Shanghai today to start an investigation into an emergency landing
caused by a problem with the landing gear.
</P>
<P>
An MD-11 plane of China Eastern Airlines became aware of the
problem with the front landing gear shortly after it took off from
Hongqiao Airport in Shanghai for Beijing at 7:38 p.m. Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The pilot was granted approval by the airport control center to
return to Hongqiao Airport. After two trials, the plane could not
put down its landing gear and circled the airport for more than
three hours. The plane then made an emergency landing after most
of its fuel had been used up.
</P>
<P>
Experts' preliminary conclusions are that the accident was
triggered by a broken bolt in the control barrel of the front
chassis.
</P>
<P>
The group is being led by Wang Li'an, deputy director of the
Civil Aviation Administration of China.

ISLAMABAD, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Foreign Minister
Sartaj Aziz Friday said the government will not accept the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) unless economic sanctions and
pressures are removed.
</P>
<P>
"We will not accept the CTBT under an atmosphere of coercion,
the economic sanctions and pressures must be removed before we
adhere to the treaty," Aziz said in his opening statement at the
joint sitting of the parliament convened to discuss Pakistan's
position on CTBT.
</P>
<P>
He stated that Pakistan has to carefully weigh its decision
and position on the treaty banning nuclear tests as nuclear
deterrence, critical to Pakistan's self-defense, is indispensable
for the country's security.
</P>
<P>
"We have crossed the threshold and our moratorium and even
accession to the CTBT, if we so decide in our national interest,
will not erode this deterrence capability," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The air quality in urban
China has deteriorated somewhat over the past week, according to
the China Environmental Monitoring Center.
</P>
<P>
The center's latest air quality report indicated less
precipitation, dry air and increased levels of suspended particles
in Lanzhou, Hohhot and Taiyuan in northern China, with rising
sulphur dioxide levels reported in southwestern China's Chongqing
Municipality. The four cities reported moderate air pollution
between September 4-10.
</P>
<P>
Experts note the weather conditions associated with the
approach of autumn are unfavorable for dispersing pollutants and
will most likely lead to a further deterioration in the urban air
quality.
</P>
<P>
A number of cities, including Beijing, Tianjin, Xi'an and
Guangzhou, recorded slight air pollution over the past week,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The major problem in Guangzhou centered on levels of nitrogen
oxide, while other cities reported high levels of suspended
particles.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-four cities, including Shanghai, Nanjing, Wuhan and
Kunming, reported good air quality.
</P>
<P>
Nine cities -- Nanning, Shantou, Wenzhou, Ningbo, Xiamen,
Zhanjiang, Shenzhen, Haikou and Beihai -- enjoyed excellent air
quality during the period.

<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, September 11 (Xinhua) -- A curtain raiser was
launched here Friday for a campaign in the South Asian region to
eradicate gender-based violence.
</P>
<P>
On the occasion, a dramatic play was presented to shed light on
gender-based violence including physical aggression, sexual abuse,
emotional abuse and political violence.
</P>
<P>
The curtain raiser was launched on the sidelines of a meeting
on gender mainstreaming in the South Asian region, which is
jointly organized by the Nepali government and the U.N.
Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM).
</P>
<P>
As part of the observance of the 50th anniversary of the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights, UNIFEM initiated early this
year in the Latin America and Caribbean region a global campaign,
the first of its kind, to eradicate gender-based violence.
</P>
<P>
In Africa, the campaign was launched in late July in Nigeria
while in the Asia-Pacific region, the campaign started on August
30 in the Philippines under the slogan of "A Life Free of
Violence: It's Our Right."
</P>
<P>
UNIFEM said that its South Asian Regional Office based in New
Delhi will be observing this campaign in the region through 16
days of activism from November 25 to December 10 this year,
involving different forms of media, women organizations, college
students and youth, governments and U.N. agencies.
</P>
<P>
It said that the campaign is taking different forms in
different countries and includes rallies, marches, cultural
programs, essay competitions and publication of various materials
on violence against women.

<P>
SHANGHAI, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Heavy Rain washed out the
first day competitions of the China Cup aerobatics world grand
prix here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"As scheduled, there should be competitions today," said Jean
Louis Monnet, chief executive of the Federation Aeronautique
Internationale (FAI) world grand prix. "But as also scheduled, it
should be a fine today. The weather, however, is too bad, so we
have to call off the competitions."
</P>
<P>
An exhibition show by renowned British aerobatics team Golden
Dreams was put on in its stead, which was later hailed by FAI
president Eilif Ness as the "greatest festival of aerobatics ever
held".
</P>
<P>
Some 5000 spectators braved nasty rain to come and see the
dazzling performances by world's best pilots from the Malaysia-ba
sed Golden Dreams team.
</P>
<P>
The pilots took off in turn, with their roaring Planes zooming
up almost vertically into the sky. They made superb rolling
turns, spins, hammerheads, tail slides and loops, leaving
spectators watching agape, apparently too startled to applaud.
</P>
<P>
"I can hardly imagine how they could manage this," said the
tournament's director Liu Liancheng, "They can pilot their planes
like leaves in the choppy wind. You will not believe it until you
see it."
</P>
<P>
The Grand Prix attracted all the 24 top finishers of last
year's world championships, who will tour eight Chinese cities of
Shanghai, Nanjing, Tianjin, Shijiazhuang, Zhengzhou, Wuhan and
Changsha.
</P>
<P>
The Grand Prix will end on November 2nd.

The King expressed the wish that the elected parliamentarians
of the two parties join the new Assembly meeting on Sept 24, the
expiration of the current Assembly.
</P>
<P>
"If you do not participate, the royal government will not
recognize you as legal assembly members and you will be deprived
of your NA privileges," the King said.
</P>
<P>
If they still refuse to join in the assembly, the king warned,
then he would not be able to protect them should they have some
problems.
</P>
<P>
The King is considered to be a pivotal figure in resolving the
political crisis in his country, although talks last weekend in
Siem Reap between the ruling Cambodian People's Party (CPP),
FUNCINPEC and the SRP failed.
</P>
<P>
King Sihanouk last week even threatened to abdicate if no
agreement is reached between the three parties this month.
</P>
<P>
A coalition is necessary because, while the CPP has a majority
in parliament, it lacks the two-thirds needed to form a government
of its own.
</P>
<P>
The two major opposition parties, which won the remainder of
parliamentary seats, have threatened to boycott parliament unless
their complaints about the election are resolved.

<HEADLINE> Philippine President Vows to Crack Down on Muslim </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada vowed Friday to crack down hard on the country's Muslim
extremist group Abu Sayyaf should they refuse to surrender or
release unharmed their captives.
</P>
<P>
Estrada also ruled out any amnesty for Abdujarak Abubakar
Janjalani, head of the group, saying he has to face trial and
punishment first before such privilege can even be considered.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Estrada said Abu Sayyaf
members, who have been blamed for a string of abductions in
southern Mindanao, should stop their lawless operations or face
the full might of the government forces.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said Abu Sayyaf members should realize by now that he
is more determined than ever to restore peace and order not only
in Metro Manila but nationwide.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said the government forces are closing in on the Abu
Sayyaf and he is expecting a breakthrough in the abduction cases
Friday or Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Abu Sayyaf members abducted five people, including a foreign
businessman in southern Zamboanga del Sur province Wednesday, one
day after kidnapping an Italian priest and 12 of his parishioners
in Zamboanga del Norte province.
</P>
<P>
Abu Sayyaf, with which the government has refused to open peace
talks, is one of the country's two Muslim groups still fighting
the government. The other is the Moro Islamic Liberation Front
(MILF) which already began peace talks with the government in
January 1997.

<HEADLINE> EU Flight Ban on Yugoslav Carriers Should Be Honored </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 11 (Xinhua) -- European Commission
President Jacques Santer demanded on Friday that the flight ban on
Yugoslav carriers be observed by all European Union (EU) member
states.
</P>
<P>
"The decision taken by the 15 (EU member states) has to be
implemented by all 15 countries," Santer said in a written
statement.
</P>
<P>
The chief of the executive body of the 15-nation European Union
added that the sanction against Yugoslavia would become
meaningless if one or several member states did not "play the
game" as previously agreed upon.
</P>
<P>
EU member state Britain claimed, citing procedural reasons,
that it could not implement the flight ban that was agreed upon
unanimously by the European council of foreign ministers in late
June and finalized by the same council last weekend.
</P>
<P>
It said that under a 1959 agreement with Yugoslavia, it is
required to give 12 months notice before canceling flights from
that country.
</P>
<P>
The British authorities quoted the European community treaty as
stipulating that member states would have to honor international
agreements and contracts with non-EU countries as well.
</P>
<P>
Greece also faces the same issue. Spain, that had held a
similar argument, later decided to implement the flight ban.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav national carrier JAT stopped flying to Germany,
Sweden, Austria, the Netherlands and Denmark after these EU member
states suspended landing rights following enforcement of the
flight ban on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Santer said the next commission meeting, scheduled for
Wednesday, will examine the implementation of the flight ban by
member states.

MANILA, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada Friday announced his appointment of Alberto Romualdez, a
consultant of the World Health Organization (WHO), as secretary of
the Department of Health.
</P>
<P>
Romualdez replaced Felipe Estrella who resigned late last month

<P>
At a news conference, Romualdez said he has three immediate
priorities in his work: cleaning up the department, streamlining
its operations and contributing to the population management
program.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The following are major
news items in leading U.S. newspapers on Friday:
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- A house committee Thursday night began the congressional
process that could lead to President Clinton's impeachment, and in
an atmosphere filled with political and personal uncertainty
recommended that the full House immediately make public
independent counsel Kenneth Starr's report on Clinton's sexual
relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
-- For many Americans, the White House scandal is just the
latest symptom of broad and deep moral decline. Every where they
look -- in the newspaper, on television, in their own neigborhoods
and even within their own families -- they see eroding values.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The report sent to Congress by the Whitewater independent
counsel, Kenneth W. Starr, contends that evidence shows President
Clinton committed perjury, obstructed justice, tampered with
withnesses and abused the power of his office in trying to cover
up an affair with Monica S. Lewinsky, lawyers familiar with the
report said Thursday. But during a meeting with Senate Democrats
at the White House, Clinton assured them they would find "no
surprises" in the report.
</P>
<P>
-- The Senate effectively killed campaign finance overhaul for
this year as quickly as it had briefly reviewed it, with
supporters failing to muster enough votes to end a Republican
filibuster and force a vote.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- A push for fresh IMF funding was set back when a House panel
rejected a bid to add 14.5 billion dollars to the 3.4 billion
dollars already included in a foreign-aid bill.
</P>
<P>
-- The Supreme Court agreed to an expedited review of whether
statistical sampling can be used in the 2000 census. Arguments are
set for September 30 and a decision is likely to come in the
Spring.

<HEADLINE> Norwegian Jenssen Ties World Record at Pentathlon Worlds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Norway's Bjorn Jenssen
turned up a world record-tying performance in the shooting here
today to take the lead in men's individual event on the first day
of the CISM 46th Military Pentathlon World Championships.
</P>
<P>
Sweden and the Netherlands were the squads to shine in the
men's and women's team event, standing atop the table after the
first day's shooting events.
</P>
<P>
Jenssen tied the world record of 200 hits to collect a maximum
1140 points in the precision and rapid shootings event, the first
discipline in the seven-day pentathlon worlds.
</P>
<P>
Anton Bondesson of Sweden followed up with 1133 points from
199 hits, with Dutchman H. Stienissen the third 1126 from 198.
</P>
<P>
"It's fantastic," Jenssen said. "If everything is OK, you need
a little good luck (to make 200 hits). I know I can shoot 200
(hits), ... but I didn't make it in competition."
</P>
<P>
"My aim is to finish 5,000 (points overall), but it's not easy
for me," Jenssen added.
</P>
<P>
Defending champion Carlos Silva of Brazil had a poor day, just
managing an indifferent 187 hits.
</P>
<P>
"He's nervous, and put too much pressure on himself. He
should make 195 (hits) or more," Brazil's coach Carlos Felipe
said. "Anyway, he's not a good shooter."
</P>
<P>
In the women's individual event, China's Wang Lianying,
four-time champion in a row, shared the first place with three
other athletes on 193 points.
</P>
<P>
In the team divisions, Sweden's male athletes provisionally
occupied the top position with 4,462 points, Norway coming on
second with 4,448 and defending champion China third on 4,399.
</P>
<P>
The Dutch women's shooters accumulated 3,224 points to finish
first before Denmark on 3,203 and Sweden on 3,182. The title
holders China were fourth on 3,161 points.

<HEADLINE> HK Financial Practitioners Promote Ethics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Some 200 representatives
from Hong Kong's financial industry participated in a conference
here Friday on the promotion of professional ethics in the
securities, futures and investments sectors.
</P>
<P>
The high-profile conference was jointly organized by nine local
institutions including the Stock Exchange, Futures Exchange,
Securities Institute and Hong Kong Clearing, and supported by the
Securities and Futures Commission and the Independent Commission
Against Corruption.
</P>
<P>
Alec Tsui, chief executive of the Stock Exchange and chairman
of the organizing committee, delivered the opening remarks. He
said the continued efforts Hong Kong has made in maintaining and
enhancing business ethics have played a significant role in
securing its position as a major international financial center.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was a clear declaration to the international
community that Hong Kong financial industry places great value on
professional ethics, said Tsui.
</P>
<P>
Financial Secretary Donald Tsang shared his views with the
industry's practitioners. "Ethics represented the correct way of
human behavior in dealing with others and it is a vital element in
 the conduct of business, whether in the public or private
sectors," Tsang said.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong is a professional market and we have reason to
demand a higher (ethical) standard of our practitioners in respect
of their advice to their clients," Tsang noted.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the view that ethics supplement rules and
regulations. "Rules and regulations, no matter how tight, will not
deliver a clean market without an ethical mind. A set of rules
will never be able to cover the entire spectrum of activities in
any financial market," he said.
</P>
<P>
The conference constituted part of a Professional Ethics
Program, which, initiated by local financial institutions, will
last two years.

<HEADLINE> Private Consumption to Boost Swedish Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The Swedish economy will
continue to grow this and next year despite the Asian crisis and
the financial turmoils on world markets, according to a forecast
by HUI, the Swedish Retailers and Wholesaler Research Institute.
</P>
<P>
After several years of belt-tightening, consumers are expected
to start shopping with enthusiasm, said the Institute. Private
consumption is expected to take the place of exports as the motor
driving Swedish industry.
</P>
<P>
Consumer spending is expected to increase by 3.2 percent this
year and by 3 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Retailers had a very strong month in August. The Swedish
furniture company IKEA, for example, reported a 35 percent growth
of sales, on the same month in 1997. Clothing and shoe sales
climbed by 42.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
On the whole, HUI feels that the financial turmoils are only
transitory.
</P>
<P>
However, the Institute predicted that the Swedish joblessness
will be 6.7 percent this year, dipping to 6 percent in 1999. This
indicates that the government's goal of less than 4 percent
unemployment by the year 2000 would not be realized.

HANOI, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Vietnamese Communist Party
chief Le Kha Phieu said Thursday that protecting farmers' rightful
interests through state policies is a most important driving force
for agriculture's shift to commodity production, Vietnamese news
media reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
At the First National Conference of Successful Farmers, Party
General Secretary Le Kha Phieu said that in recent years, farmers
have raised their sense of self-reliance, unity and unanimity, and
have made important contribution to the implementation of the
party line and state policies.
</P>
<P>
Phieu stressed that agriculture has in recent years been
considered the primary front of the country's renovation.
</P>
<P>
He said that the role of agriculture and rural economy is to
ensure national food security, help stabilize socio-economic
situation, provide employment and raise income for the rural labor
force.
</P>
<P>
A total of 194 farmers, representing millions of their
counterparts successful in production and business, attended the

<HEADLINE> Lubutu Town Retaken From Congolese Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 11 (Xinhua) -- President Laurent Kabila's
troops have retaken the eastern town of Lubutu in the Democratic
Republic of Congo after intense bombardments, a report reaching
here from Kinshasa said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Lubutu, located on the highway between the third city of
Kisangani and eastern town of Bukavu bordering Rwanda, returned
to the embraces of Kabila's loyalists with 45 rebels killed and
19 taken prisoner, a communique from the Information Ministry was
quoted by state television as saying.
</P>
<P>
But the news did not say when Kabila's loyalists took the
town.
</P>
<P>
The rebels, who took up arms on August 2 to oust Kabila,
refused to abide by a cease-fire and claimed they had won fresh
victories in other eastern front areas of Congo, have not been
invited to go to Ethiopia for regional talks on the settlement of
the Congo conflict which resumed Thursday.
</P>
<P>
No sign of a breakthrough on a cease-fire is imminent when
defense ministers of seven neighboring countries are meeting in
Addis Ababa to continue their negotiations on the Congo crisis.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia sent troops to intervene on
August 20 and thus turned the tide of fighting in western Congo,
but the rebels are still occupying large areas in eastern Congo.
</P>
<P>
President Kabila refuses to recognize the rebel group of the
Congolese Democratic Coalition as an internal movement and his
allied backers insist on talking with its alleged sponsors of
Rwanda and Uganda for a cease-fire agreement.
</P>
<P>
This hinders the achievement of a breakthrough on a cease-fire
in the war-torn Congo (K).

<HEADLINE> HK to Become Innovation &AMP; Tech Center: Advisor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong needs urgently to
develop itself into a center of innovation and technology to face
the challenges in the knowledge-based, global economy of the 21st
century, an advisor of the HK chief executive on technology said
here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Professor Chang-Lin Tien, chairman of the Chief Executive's
Commission on Innovation and Technology established in March 1998,
suggested "a new vision" which he said Hong Kong should take in
order to maintain its international competitiveness. And the new
vision is "Hong Kong as a center of innovation and technology."
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong needs to broaden its economic base to cushion itself
from external shocks like the Asian financial turmoil," the
engineering professor of University of California, Berkeley, said
in an address at a luncheon sponsored by the American Chamber of
Commerce in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
According to Professor Tien, in the late 1970s, 24 percent of
Hong Kong's economy was based on manufacturing while today only 7
percent was built on manufacturing because of a massive shift of
industrial facilities to the Pearl River Delta in southern China
over the past two decades.
</P>
<P>
He said: "There is certainly a silver lining" in the Asian
financial turmoil, which, though painful, has forced more and more
Hong Kong people to come to realize the need to develop hi-tech
and knowledge-based industry.
</P>
<P>
"This is really an urgent business right now," he said, adding
"Time is essential."
</P>
<P>
Professor Tien suggested that Hong Kong invest in higher skills
and more advanced technologies to increase productivity, promote
innovation and engage in higher value-added activities.
</P>
<P>
That is part of the content of an interim report Tien and his
commission are now preparing to advise the Special Administrative
Region (SAR) government on policies related to technology and
industry.
</P>
<P>
Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa, when delivering his policy
address on October 7, may take in some recommendations from the
report to be submitted by the end of September.
</P>
<P>
Professor Tien said his commission's mission is to identify the
measures needed to realize Hong Kong's new vision. "I am
optimistic," said the chairman, who listed a string of Hong Kong's
strengths -- free market policies, a sound legal system, access
to mainland market, technology and expertise, a productive and
adaptable workforce, entrepreneurial culture and a vibrant and
well-developed capital market.
</P>
<P>
He also pointed out Hong Kong's weaknesses, such as meager
input in research and development and lack of research centers, a
technology culture and resources.

Russia and the United States from about 6,000 each to no more than
3,500 each by the year 2007.

<HEADLINE> S. African, Namibian Bourses Sign Coop Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The Johannesburg Stock
Exchange (JSE) of South Africa and the Namibian Stock Exchange
(NSE) Friday signed in Windhoek a cooperation agreement over
exchanges of technology, skills and information.
</P>
<P>
The accord, which falls within the framework of the Southern
African Development Community (SADC) harmonization program,
includes the transfer of expertise and information on training,
marketing and research.
</P>
<P>
JSE spokeswoman Suzette Plantema said at a news briefing that
the first result of the pact would be the replacement of the
trading systems of the NSE and its eventual full automation.
</P>
<P>
"The stock exchanges of the SADC sub-region have formed a
committee which meets to identify areas of cooperation and
harmonization in the interests of the development of the Southern
African capital markets.
</P>
<P>
"The memorandum of understanding between the JSE and the NSE
is a first step in taking these relationships into more formal
links and is open to other SADC exchanges to join in the future,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
The JSE and the NSE were already working on facilities for the
latter to use the former's world-class Johannesburg equities
trade computer system. Live prices of securities on both
exchanges would be widely disseminated across the region and
internationally from November this year.
</P>
<P>
By the same date, NSE member brokers would also have the JSE
broker deal accounting system, which offers improved client
administration, security and regulation.
</P>
<P>
The next phase of the agreement to be effected next year
includes NSE access to the computerized clearing and settlement
systems being implemented in the local market under the JSE's
share transactions totally electronic project.
</P>
<P>
This would make the Namibian and South African market comply
with the highest international standards of capital market
security, efficiency and investor protection, meaning that paper
certificates would no longer be used in the settlement of stock
exchange trades.

<HEADLINE> Bank Prepares for Funding Cotton Purchases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beijing, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The Agricultural Development
Bank of China (ADBC) has been well-prepared for providing
sufficient loans for this year's cotton purchases, sources from
the ADBC said today.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the ADBC said the bank, together with other
related departments, has estimated the amount of funds needed for
this year's cotton purchases and worked out a money-supply
schedule.
</P>
<P>
In a recent circular, the ADBC urged its branches at various
levels to take effective measures to accomplish the money-supply
work for cotton purchases.
</P>
<P>
The circular requires that newly extended loans should match
the value of the reserves of newly purchased cotton.
</P>
<P>
The ADBC also requires a closed management of loans earmarked
for purchasing cotton, demanding its branches to keep a firm
control over the volume of loans and ban any diversion of funds.
</P>
<P>
The ADBC spokesman stressed that loans for cotton purchases are
the state's policy-oriented loans and can only be used by
cotton-purchasing and reserve enterprises for that purpose.
</P>
<P>
The ADBC also requires its branches to strictly supervise and
manage the opening of accounts by cotton-purchasing enterprises to
prevent any diversion of loans.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong is to hold
by-election on October 29 for one seat vacated in the first
Legislative Council, a government spokesman said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The nomination for the by-election for the regional council
functional constituency will run from September 17 to 30, a
spokesman for the Registration and Electoral Office said.
</P>
<P>
Two legislators from the regional and functional constituencies
 were unseated recently, one due to Tang Siu-tong of the regional
council constituency who was declared last week not duly elected
following a court ruling that he had tied with another rival
candidate after some of his votes were declared, and the other
due to Chim Pui-chung from the functional constituency, who was
expelled from the legislature after being sentenced to a
three-year imprisonment for fraud.
</P>
<P>
The date for the by-election for the latter has not been
decided yet.
</P>
<P>
The first Legislative Council of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region was elected on May 24 this year.

<HEADLINE> Swedishi Charity Group Aids Flood Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANCHANG, September 11 (Xinhua) -- A private charity
organization in Sweden is devoting itself to raising money for the
people hit by the catastrophic floods in China this summer.
</P>
<P>
Star of Hope International, a Stockholm-based development and
relief aid organization, is providing 600,000 Swedish crowns
(about 100,000 U.S. dollars) worth of medicine and hardtack to
people in three counties in Hubei, Jiangxi and Heilongjiang
provinces, which have been most affected by the floods.
</P>
<P>
Bjorg Farstad, a senior official with the organization,
said: "This vitamin and mineral biscuit gives a person all the
vitamins, minerals and protein that human needs for a day. It's a
good supplement to the rice the people receive from the
government."
</P>
<P>
Farstad is also authorized by her group to buy quality medicine
at local pharmaceutical companies with the special fund of 600,000
crowns.
</P>
<P>
"Because the problem is too big for China considering the
magnitude of the disaster, I hope that other governments and
other organizations will do something," she said.
</P>
<P>
Star of Hope International is campaigning in the media to
solicit more aid in Sweden for the flood victims.
</P>
<P>
"We have even contacted all Chinese restaurants in my country
to see what they can do," said Farstad, citing that her colleagues
in Stockholm are working hard to raise fund.
</P>
<P>
Livia Alm, a nutrition expert with the Karolinska Institute of
the Medical University of Sweden, said: "I think the Chinese
government has done an excellent job. It has done everything it
could."
</P>
<P>
"The victims' temporary settlements are very well organized
and the people are well taken of," she said.
</P>
<P>
"I don't see anyone actually suffering from urgent matters,
they are given food, medical care and schooling," said Alm, also a
professor of Biotechnology Department at Shanghai Fisheries
University.
</P>
<P>
The 70-year-old Alm said she endeavored to raise funds to buy
the special biscuit, which has been developed specifically for
flood and earthquake disaster victims.
</P>
<P>
"The biscuit can be used for anyone from a six-month-old child
on up, and the medicine helps fight against intestinal infection,
skin infections and other diseases," she said.
</P>
<P>
"We are happy to see that these people are not left alone. The
Chinese people are kind to each other, and the victims are
provided with food, clinics and schools," Alm added.
</P>
<P>
Farstad said: "I don't know how much we will be able to assist
these flood victims after this first donation, but I hope that we
can do more."
</P>
<P>
The organization works mainly to help women and children. It
promotes education for poor children from infancy to youth when
they can get jobs and take care of themselves.
</P>
<P>
"In the near future, Star of Hope International will help the
orphans in the country through China Charity Federation," she said.
</P>
<P>
However, the organization is primarily focusing on the
flood-hit areas in China.
</P>
<P>
The flood disaster in the northeastern, central and eastern
provinces killed 3,004 people, cost 166.6 billion yuan in economic
loss, affected more than 200 million residents and has left about
20 million homeless.

<HEADLINE> South Asian Meeting on Gender Mainstreaming Opens in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The two-day meeting on
gender mainstreaming in the South Asian region began here Friday
with focus on evolving a strategy and time frame for a regional
intervention for engendering the planning process.
</P>
<P>
Attending the meeting are secretaries and senior officials of
the women affairs ministries, members of national planning
commissions, representatives of key NGOs and activists from the
seven member countries of the South Asian Association for Regional
Cooperation -- Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the Maldives, Nepal,
Pakistan and Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of U.N. agencies are also present at the
meeting, organized jointly by the Nepali government and the U.N.
Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM).
</P>
<P>
Addressing the meeting, Chandni Joshi, regional program advisor
of UNIFEM, noted that at the Fourth World Conference on Women in
Beijing in September 1995, it was unanimously agreed and
emphasized time and again that gender mainstreaming was one of the
fundamental strategies to achieve equality between women and men.
</P>
<P>
But the second South Asian regional meeting on women issues
which ended here Thursday noted that there is a lack of proper
mainstreaming of gender consideration across sectors in the
region, where gender continues to be seen as a "women's issue" and
the responsibility of the women affairs ministries only.
</P>
<P>
According to UNIFEM, gender mainstreaming refers to a strategy
for making gender considerations an integral dimension in the
design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of policies and
programs in all political, economic and societal spheres so that
inequality is not perpetuated and women and men can benefit
equally.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, participants are scheduled to share their
experiences and contribute expertise toward developing new ideas
and plans of action for gender mainstreaming in this region.
</P>
<P>
They will also review the progress that has been made and
identify challenges facing SAARC countries in this regard.
</P>
<P>
At the working session of the meeting Friday, representatives
of India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh and the Maldives presented
case study and perspectives respectively.

<HEADLINE> House Remodeling Thriving in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DALIAN, September 11 (Xinhua) -- China's house remodeling
industry is entering a robust period, thanks to the rapid
improvement of the Chinese people's life quality.
</P>
<P>
An incomplete survey shows that Chinese now spend at least 50
billion yuan (about 6.02 billion U.S. dollars) on house remodeling
each year, including 12.5 billion yuan last year in Shanghai alone.
</P>
<P>
One-fifth of the families in China's major large and
medium-sized cities have already remodeled or plan to remodel
their apartments, according to the survey.
</P>
<P>
It adds that nearly all the resident housing sold over the past
few years had been remodeled.
</P>
<P>
Architects attribute this emerging industry to the increase in
annual income and housing reforms which make it possible to own
private apartments.
</P>
<P>
They also pointed out some problems in the remodeling industry,
such as the use of some polluting or harmful materials and the
neglect of safety standards.
</P>
<P>
Architects have called on the media to help people who want to
remodel their houses do it safely, taking space and energy
conservation into consideration.

<HEADLINE> India Softens Stand on CTBT </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Atal Bihari
Vajpayee said Friday that India accepted the spirit underlying the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT), which he had described
earlier as discriminative.
</P>
<P>
The Indian government led by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)
would take a decision on whether to sign the CTBT after
discussions with key interlocutors, Vajpayee said in Lucknow,
capital city of north Uttar Pradesh, at the end of his two-day
visit to the state.
</P>
<P>
Following India's nuclear tests last May, the Indian government
declared a moratorium on further tests while refusing to sign the
CTBT on the ground that it was discriminative to countries like
India.
</P>
<P>
But under pressure both at home and abroad on the nuclear
issue, the government had privately told certain foreign
governments that it was not averse to signing the treaty.
</P>
<P>
According to the Press Trust of India, the Indian prime
minister asserted that something more is required to be done by
the nuclear weapon states before his country thinks of signing the
CTBT but he did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
The Times of India daily reported Wednesday that India was
inching closer to signing the CTBT but fears of an adverse
political fallout were preventing the Vajpayee government from
putting its signature to the treaty.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that adhering to the CTBT will not jeopardize our
security concerns," the paper quoted a senior official in the
prime minister's office as saying.
</P>
<P>
The ruling BJP is now planning to talk to all political parties
in the next couple of weeks to get their views and prepare the
ground for eventually signing of the CTBT.
</P>
<P>
However, the BJP leaders are worried that the Congress and
other opposition parties could take this opportunity to try to
pull down the Vajpayee government.
</P>
<P>
There is fear among the Indian leaders that without getting
something in return from the United States and other nuclear
powers, it will be difficult to sell the treaty to the Indian
people.

<HEADLINE> Red Cross Helps Rescue Water System in Kinshasa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The International Committee
of the Red Cross (ICRC) Friday flew 40 tons of vital water
treatment chemicals from Nairobi to help rescue water system in
violent Democratic Congo's capital Kinshasa.
</P>
<P>
"The emergency in Kinshasa today is clean water. The city's
general hygiene and millions of citizens depend on this. Without
this chlorine, the city's water treatment will come to a
standstill today," said the ICRC in a statement issued here.
</P>
<P>
The water supply in Kinshasa relies on three main water
treatment plants that need four types of chemicals, including
chlorine, in order to provide 250 million liters of potable water
per day for its citizens. Without any one chemical, the whole
system falls apart, according to the statement.
</P>
<P>
Pierre-Yves Monnard, an ICRC official in Kinshasa, was quoted
as saying that without clean water, epidemics might spread in the
city with over five million inhabitants who would have to resort
to drinking water from contaminated wells or the two rivers that
run through the city.
</P>
<P>
"Both the Congo and Ndjili rivers are extremely muddy,
containing high amounts of lethal pathogens and therefore not fit
for human consumption," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The ICRC official said that citizens of Kinshasa have few
resources to boil contaminated water to ensure proper hygiene as
there is a lack of firewood in the city and coal is extremely
expensive.
</P>
<P>
International donors have also lined up to join in an airlift
of food and medical supplies for Kinshasa, which was cut off from
port supplies because of the civil war since August 2.
</P>
<P>
The road and rail corridor through which 75 percent of food
and supplies enter Kinshasa from Matadi remains closed because of
the fighting between the Tutsi-led rebels and the government
troops loyal to Congolese President Laurent Kabila since last
month.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Condemns Killing of Iranian Diplomats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Turkey on Friday strongly
condemned the killing of nine Iranian diplomats based in northern
Afghanistan by the Taliban militia.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the Foreign Ministry said that "we heard
the news that the kidnaped Iranian diplomats were killed in
Afghanistan with great anxiety and indignation."
</P>
<P>
Turkey called on the international community to take effective
measures in a bid to prevent such kinds of inhuman actions in the
future, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Iran said it held the Afghan Taliban militia and
their supporter Pakistan responsible for the killing of the
Iranian diplomats, who were missing after the Taliban captured the
northern Afghan city of Mazar-e-Sharif on August 8.
</P>
<P>
Iran claimed that altogether 11 diplomats and a correspondent
of its official news agency were kidnaped by the Taliban, who
denied knowing anything about the whereabouts of those people.
</P>
<P>
Not until Thursday did the Taliban confirmed nine of the
diplomats have been killed by "renegade forces" and their bodies
found, but it did not mention the fate of the others.
</P>
<P>
Iran has vowed to take revenge on the Taliban. Over the past
few days, it massed about 70,000 troops along the border with
Afghanistan, making a revenge attack or even a military incursion
possible.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has been in contact with Afghan opposition leaders
including ousted President Burhanuddin Rabbani and urged for a
broad based government in the country. It feared the Taliban's
control of the country would encourage fundamentalist trend in the
region.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Confident Duma Will Confirm Primakov </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris
Yeltsin Friday said he has no doubt that Yevgeny Primakov will be
confirmed as prime minister in the State Duma, lower house of
parliament.
</P>
<P>
The president said his confidence was based on popular support
for the nominee.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin nominated Primakov for premier on Thursday after the
Duma rejected Viktor Chernomyrdin twice for the prime minister's
post. The lawmakers will vote on Yeltsin's third nomination at
17:00 local time Friday.
</P>
<P>
Russia will survive a crucial political crisis due to the
politicians' compromise at the critical moment, Yeltsin said.
</P>
<P>
The Russian government is facing very difficult tasks. It is
necessary to urgently lower prices, fill the shops with goods
again, restore the banking system, and guarantee the safety of
bank deposits, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said he believed those issues can be solved by the new
government with the support of both the president and the
parliament.
</P>
<P>
The president also called on all branches of government to make
joint efforts to overcome the current crisis.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Friday Yeltsin and Primakov had a meeting in the
Kremlin. Both were reported to agree that the priority at present
is to iron out the economic crisis and pave the way for economic
growth.

<HEADLINE> China to Persist in 'Strike Hard' Drive, State Councillor Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Luo Gan, China's top law
enforcement official and state councillor, said today that the
country must persist in its "strike hard" anti-crime drive to
reduce the rising rate of serious criminal offenses.
</P>
<P>
"Generally speaking, the public security situation in the first
half of this year has been stable, but crime rates in some places
are rising sharply and the increase of certain categories of
felonies has been prominent," Luo said.
</P>
<P>
He was speaking at a plenary meeting of the Central Committee
of Comprehensive Management of Public Security under the Chinese
Communist Party, of which he is director.
</P>
<P>
He is also a Political Bureau member of the CPC Central
Committee and head of the Central Political and Legal Committee of
the CPC.
</P>
<P>
Localities must step up efforts to crack down on alarming
crimes in their areas and beat arrogant and aggressive criminals
to curb the rising crime rate and maintain a sound and safe social
order, Luo said at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Law enforcement bodies should especially focus their attention
on the ongoing fight against smugglers in accordance with the
order given by President Jiang Zemin on the anti-smuggling fight.
</P>
<P>
To root out potential factors causing social instability, more
work has to be done to build "safe and civilized" communities
where neighborhoods have to be mobilized to help police
communities, he said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he called on law enforcement officers in flood-hit
areas to work hard to provide a favorable environment for flooding
victims to rebuild their homes and regain prosperity.
</P>
<P>
The meeting also heard work reports on helping released
prisoners find new jobs.
</P>
<P>
Luo said that this work is important for preventing and
reducing recidivism and needs support from the whole society.
</P>
<P>
Vice-chairman of the top legislature Cao Zhi, top judge Xiao
Yang and top prosecutor Han Zhubin also attended the meeting
today.

<HEADLINE> House Remoulding Thriving in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DALIAN, September 11 (Xinhua) -- China's house remoulding
industry is entering a robust period, thanks to the rapid
improvement of the Chinese people's life quality.
</P>
<P>
An incomplete survey shows that Chinese now spend at least 50
billion yuan (about 6.02 billion U.S. dollars) on house remoulding
each year, including 12.5 billion yuan last year in Shanghai alone.
</P>
<P>
One-fifth of the families in China's major large and
medium-sized cities have already or plan to remould their
apartments, according to the survey.
</P>
<P>
It adds that nearly all the resident housing sold over the past
few years had been remoulded.
</P>
<P>
Architects attribute this emerging industry to the increase in
annual income and housing reforms which make it possible to own
private apartments.
</P>
<P>
They also pointed out some problems in the remoulding industry,
such as the use of some polluting or harmful materials and the
neglect of safety standards.
</P>
<P>
Architects have called on the media to help people who want to
remould their houses do it safely, taking space and energy
conservation into consideration.

In the course of localization, those who are chosen to act as
leading figures of government departments must receive good

government will hold more related training activities in the
future.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the belief that the localization work can be

<HEADLINE> Unilateral Inspections of Fishing Ban Show Increased Compliance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Recent unilateral inspections
of the Yellow and East China seas revealed effective compliance with
the summer fishing ban, according to the Ministry of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
"China has expanded its moratorium in terms of both time and
scope, and the number of fishing boats violating the ban has
continued to decline," according to Peng Xiaohua, an official with
the ministry's Fisheries Bureau.
</P>
<P>
The goal of the check was to ensure compliance with the
offshore fishing moratorium, said Peng, adding that the check
indicated the nation's strong commitment to promoting the
sustainable development of fisheries.
</P>
<P>
The moratorium applies to over 90,000 Chinese fishing boats,
including over 22,000 operating in the East China Sea. The check
revealed that only two per thousand boats in the East China Sea
violated the fishing ban this year, compared with 3.5 per
thousand during last summer's moratorium.
</P>
<P>
Peng attributed the improvement to an increasing awareness of
the need for the ban and efforts local governments have made to
strengthen both management and supervision.
</P>
<P>
All local fisheries departments operating in the East China Sea
area have adopted stern measures towards illegal boats, including
fines and the confiscation of nets, according to Zhang Qiuhua,
assistant director of the Bureau of the East China Sea Fisheries
Management and Fishing Port Superintendency.
</P>
<P>
Peng admitted that falling output in the first half of the year
and the extension of moratorium period have prompted some
fishermen to ignore the ban.
</P>
<P>
Fishing with trawl nets and other "hazardous fishing equipment"
has been banned for a three month period over an area ranging from
26 degrees to 35 degrees north latitude, and for two months in
areas north of 35 degrees and from 24.5 degrees to 26 degrees
north latitude.
</P>
<P>
China introduced the overall summer fishing ban in 1995. The
two month ban in effect over the past three years has helped
protect the natural habitat for fry. The ban has helped increase
the size of major fish species, such as hairtail, and has at the
same time improved offshore output figures.
</P>
<P>
Statistics for 1997 show that the output for hairtail grew by
15 percent and for small yellow croaker by 38 percent compared
to figure for 1994 before introduction of the moratorium.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Government to Pursue Charter Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government will
create in January 1999 a preparatory constitutional commission to
study proposed changes to the country's 1987 Constitution, the
Presidential Press Office said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The office said in a press release that the commission will be
composed of respected jurists, political scientists, and
representatives of the Church and other sectors of society.
</P>
<P>
President Joseph Estrada was quoted as telling a forum Thursday
night that whatever amendments to the charter are approved will
take effect after his term.
</P>
<P>
According to Estrada, after the commission finished its study,
the election of delegates to the Constitutional Convention will be
held to coincide with the mid-term election in the year 2001.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said the selection of the commission's membership has
begun, but the commission itself will be convened in next January.
</P>
<P>
The creation of a commission on constitutional reforms is one
of the priorities listed by the Estrada administration which took
office at the end of June this year.
</P>
<P>
Estrada's predecessor, former president Fidel Ramos, had
pursued to amend the charter in 1997 which he said gave too much
power to the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
But Ramos's supporters stopped the charter change campaign
after being widely accused of trying to allow Ramos to extend his
six-year term.

<HEADLINE> Police Block Pakistani Embassy for Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Iranian security forces on
Friday surrounded the Pakistani embassy here to avoid possible
attacks following the confirmation of the killing of Iranian
diplomats by the Pakistan-backed Afghan Taliban militia.
</P>
<P>
All the streets leading to the Pakistani embassy have been
blocked and even reporters are not allowed to get access to the
embassy.
</P>
<P>
An Iranian source told Xinhua that the security measure was
taken after a group of Iranians attacked the embassy Thursday
night. An embassy staff, contacted by Xinhua, confirmed that
attack but refused to give details.
</P>
<P>
The attack came after the Iranian Foreign Ministry held the
Taliban and Pakistan responsible for the killing of nine Iranian
diplomats in Mazar-e-Sharif, northern Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban on Thursday confirmed the death of the Iranians and
said they have found the bodies. It had repeatedly denied knowing
the whereabouts of these people missing since August 8.
</P>
<P>
Tehran claimed that 11 diplomats and a correspondent of the
official news agency were captured by the Taliban troops in
Mazar-e-Sherif, a stronghold of the opposition Northern Alliance
which Iran supports.
</P>
<P>
Former Iranian President Hashemi Rafsanjani vowed on Friday
that Iran would take revenge on the Taliban for the killing. "I
promise that the families of the martyrs and Iranian nation would
witness the revenge on the Taliban for martyring our diplomats,"
he said at the Friday prayers.
</P>
<P>
He said that Iran would not take any hasty action, but would
carry out a well-designed plan with "clear objectives" at an
appropriate time.
</P>
<P>
Iran has massed over the past few days up to 70,000 troops
along the border with Afghanistan to put more pressure to bear on
the Taliban, and announced another military maneuver there within
days.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here say the tragic fate of these diplomats outraged
the Iranian government, making a retaliatory strike or even a
military incursion all the more possible than before.
</P>
<P>
After the Friday prayers, hundreds of Iranians marched along
the street in front of Tehran University, announcing their
readiness to fight against the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
They shouted slogans such as "Death to the Taliban, Death to
(Pakistani Prime Minister) Nawaz Sharif," urging supreme leader
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who is commander of the armed forces, to
issue war order against the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi on Friday
urged the United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan to take
necessary measures against the Afghan Taliban militia.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone conversation with Annan, Kharrazi said that the
Taliban's atrocious act was a clear example of war crimes and
crime against humanity.
</P>
<P>
He had called on the Security Council to put pressures on the
Taliban to hand over the bodies of the killed Iranian diplomats,
to put those responsible on trial and to release all Iranians
captured.

The secretary-general said this in his report submitted to the
U.N. Security Council, according to a report reaching here Friday
from New York where the U.N. headquarters is based.
</P>
<P>
Annan noted that the Angolan peace process may have the last
chance because the term of the U.N. observers mission will expire
on September 15 this year and it can only be extended till
January 31, 1999.
</P>
<P>
"The U.N. observers has to end their mission in Angola in
early 1999 no matter whether there is actual progress or not in
implementation of the Protocol by November this year after its
assessment will be made of the peace process," said the U.N.
secretary-general.
</P>
<P>
He added in his report that "it will be identified who should
be responsible" for the failure in the Angolan peace process.
</P>
<P>
If there is decisive progress by then, Annan said, the term of
the U.N. mission will be automatically extended so as to exert
its efforts to help achieve the final peace in the war-ravaged
southern African country.
</P>
<P>
Annan held President Jonas Savimbi's National Union for Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA) mainly responsible for the
worsening situation in the country.
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, the peace process is in stalemate basically due to
the retrogression of Savimbi in implementing the Lusaka Peace
Protocol," said the U.N. chief.
</P>
<P>
Annan stressed at the end of his report that urgent measures
should be taken "in a bid to resume and accompish the (Angolan)
peace process."

<HEADLINE> China Anticipates Sharp Rise in Offshore Oil Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The China National Offshore
Oil Corp (CNOOC) expects to pump a record 16.5 million tons of
crude oil this year, compared with 16.28 million tons in 1997.
</P>
<P>
China had produced more than 11 million tons of offshore oil by
the end of August, or some 67.4 percent of the country's planned
output target for 1998, according to CNOOC President Wang Yan.
</P>
<P>
CNOOC has engaged in strenuous efforts to maintain stable
offshore oil production amidst declining worldwide oil prices and
production, said Yan.
</P>
<P>
He noted that China has place priority on exploration for
offshore oil and has invited extensive foreign cooperation in oil
and gas exploration in the South China, East China and Yellow seas.
</P>
<P>
CNOOC has signed over 130 oil contracts and agreements
with some 70-odd oil companies from 18 countries and regions, with
total overseas investments reaching at 6.4 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Yan pointed out the CNOOC has recoreded an astonishing 80
percent success rate for wildcat offshore drilling this year, and
expects to verify additional oil reserves of 130 million tons and
gas reserves totalling 10 billion cu. m. by the end of this year.

<HEADLINE> Economists Warn Against World Economic Recession </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Economists, attending a
seminar here, warned Friday that Russia's deepening economic
crisis, if unresolved, would lead the world economies toward a
great depression unseen in decades.
</P>
<P>
Russia serves as "a wake up call" for the world to take action
against a possible global recession, Sa-ard Theerarojanawong, vice
president of Thailand's largest bank's foreign exchange trading
department, said at the seminar entitled "Malaysia, Hong Kong and
Russia -- A New Wave of Crisis".
</P>
<P>
He said such a depression is likely to push down all asset
prices worldwide substantially, so that every nation on every
continent would certainly feel the negative effects.
</P>
<P>
"It would be like a domino effect, one country would fall after
the others," he said.
</P>
<P>
Aside from the importance of the Russian issue in terms of
saving the global economy, Sa-ard said Japan, China and Hong Kong
will also play a greater role in protecting the world from
potential turmoil.
</P>
<P>
He said Japan, the major lender to Asian countries, should get
its banking system on its feet as fast as possible as China and
Hong Kong should show their economic strength and quash all
speculation of a currency devaluation.
</P>
<P>
"If the rumors continue, the global economic system will never
recover, and it will be as though we are walking back and forth in
a dark tunnel," he said.
</P>
<P>
An interest rate cut by the U.S. Federal Reserve, he said,
would help prevent capital flowing outside the country into the
U.S. and that would be another way to help save the world from a
depression.
</P>
<P>
Nattapong Samit-Ampaipisarn, vice president of Siam Commercial
Bank's Treasury Department, forecast that there is a more than 50
percent chance that the world will fall victim to a widespread
recession if the markets continue to plump to new depths.
</P>
<P>
Fears of a global economic depression are now mounting, as
emerging markets are expected to trigger a renewed depression,
given that Russia's economic slump coincided with the Asian
economic crises while Latin America has become the latest casualty
of the market turmoil, participants in the seminar noted.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the United States, considered as the world's
strongest economy, is expected to be hit as the country has huge
investment exposure in Latin American countries while European
nations would also be rocked due to their exposure in Russia, they
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Opposition protesters and
government supporters clashed in here Friday, leaving at least one
man wounded in the right leg.
</P>
<P>
The man was shot in the leg when riot policemen moved in and
fired shots to disperse clashing opposition protesters and
government supporters in front the U.S. Embassy.
</P>
<P>
Riot police, military police and members of the Flying Tigers,
an elite motorcycle police unit, were patroling the city and
trying to clear protesters from the streets.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of protesters gathered around the Independence
Monument about 10 a.m. while hundreds of government supporters
rallied in front of the Royal Palace.
</P>
<P>
The situation in Cambodia aggravated following the announcement
of the official results of the July 26 parliament elections.
</P>
<P>
The People's Party led by Second Prime Minister Hun Sen won 64
of the 122 National Assembly seats in the election, which is not
enough for the two-thirds required to form a government alone.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen offered to form a coalition government with opposition
FUNCINPEC and the Sam Rainsy Party. But his offer was turned down
the opposition who complained about election fraud.
</P>
<P>
The tension between the two camps badly worsened on Monday,
when riot police dispersed demonstrators by force. One was killed
and several wounded in the conflict.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The ECOWAS Committee of Seven
on Guinea Bissau is scheduled to meet in Abidjan Tuesday with a
team of the Community of Portuguese-Speaking States (CPLP) to
continue their efforts in finding a solution to the Guinea Bissau
crisis.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is a follow-up of a two-day joint meeting of the

agreement signed at Praia, Cape Verde, the Nigerian Tribune
newspaper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Before the meeting, chiefs of staff and military experts from
the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and CPLP

establishing of an observer team, composition of a multi-nation
force and other measures aimed at bringing lasting peace to that
country.
</P>
<P>
Under the cease-fire agreement, the government of Guinea
Bissau and the self-proclaimed military junta, two parties of the
conflict in the tiny west African country, agreed to public
recognition of democratic institutions and legality, freezing of
their respective military positions, and reopening of Osvaldo
Vieira Airport.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Armed Forces to Take Stern Action Against </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Armed Forces
(ABRI) will not hesitate to take stern action against
demonstrations which tend to lead to unrest, Defense Minister and
Commander of the ABRI Gen. Wiranto said Friday.
</P>
<P>
"ABRI is not willing to allow the acts of some groups of people
to affect more than 200 million Indonesians who want prosperity,
peace and justice," he said.
</P>
<P>
Wiranto refused to elaborate on what kind of action the ABRI
would take.
</P>
<P>
There are some procedures that the ABRI has to follow and that
they are based on the present regulation in lieu of law on the
freedom of expression, he said after attending a meeting at the
House of Representatives for the presentation of the bill on the
freedom of expression.
</P>
<P>
The bill was presented by Justice Minister Muladi to the House
of Representatives for approval.
</P>
<P>
According to the regulation, a police permit is required if a
demonstration involves more than 50 people. Street protests are
also banned around the presidential palaces, military
installations and other vital locations.
</P>
<P>
Wiranto stressed that the regulation is aimed at securing
national interest.
</P>
<P>
This is not for the interest of the military or the government,
he said, adding that the people, including students, have to
respect the nation's achievements.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to damages caused to the House of
Representatives building after students occupied it last May.
</P>
<P>
Students this week have stepped up protests against the
government for its inability to control the rising prices of
essential commodities.

<HEADLINE> Solomon Islands in Constitutional Crisis: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The Solomon Islands
parliament will meet on September 25 to consider a no-confidence
motion in the government of Prime Minister Bartholomew Ulufa'alu,
the Australian Associated Press reported (AAP) Friday.
</P>
<P>
Solomon Islands Government Information Director Johnson Honimae
said the date for the special sitting of parliament was announced
by Speaker Paul Tovua Friday, the wire service said.
</P>
<P>
The announcement follows a decision by High Court Chief Justice
John Muria Thursday upholding an order by Governor-General Moses
Pitakaka for an early meeting of parliament to debate a motion of
no confidence in the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Ulufa'alu had challenged the governor-general's order, claiming
the governor-general could only call for an early sitting of
parliament in a state of emergency such as a war.
</P>
<P>
Moses issued the order on September 1, saying parliament had to
resolve the issue of the prime minister heading a minority
government.
</P>
<P>
In a radio address to the nation Thursday night, Ulufa'alu said
 the government was considering appealing against the High Court
decision.
</P>
<P>
Ulufa'alu said the governor-general may have the power to call
a special meeting of parliament to deal with a vote of no
confidence, but calling such a meeting set a precedent with "very
bad side effects".
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said the governor-general was only a
ceremonial figure.
</P>
<P>
Ulufa'alu said the island nation's opposition had given to the
governor-general a list of MPs which purported to show the
opposition had support from 25 MPs while the government had only
24.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said if numerical strength based on a list
was to guide Solomon Islands politics, the government could change
almost every month.

SINGAPORE, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Share prices plummeted on
Singapore Stock Market Friday as overnight drop on Wall Street and
uncertainty over Malaysian shares on CLOB, Singapore's

The benchmark Straits Times Index (STI) lost 11.81 points to
close at 853.19 as these negative factors weighed on market

negative sentiment which pushed the Japanese share market into a
steep downward spiral, brokers said.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark all ordinaries index tumbled 58 points to finish
at 2,468.3, with most of the damage caused by a late sell-off.
</P>
<P>
Japanese stock prices took their biggest plunge of the year
Friday, shedding more than five percent following the Bank of
Japan's easing of monetary policy this week had failed to buoy the
Japanese market.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese market was disheartened by developments in the
United States' economic and political arenas and deepening turmoil
in Latin America, brokers said.
</P>
<P>
On Australian equities markets, industrial stocks felt the
blunt of negative sentiment from the Japanese market, with the all
industrials index diving 111.5 points to 4,340.3.
</P>
<P>
The all resources index shed 13.1 points to 957.5, buoyed by
gains in the gold sector on the back of a surge in the price of
the precious metal.
</P>
<P>
The gold index stacked on 61.7 points to 1,015.0, with the spot
price of gold bullion in Sydney surging to a close of 293.75 U.S.

CANBERRA, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar closed
nearly 1.2 U.S. cents stronger Friday, breaking through the 60.00
U.S. cent mark during Friday's trading, the first time in
approximately a month.
</P>
<P>
The rally was sparked by a tumble in the U.S. dollar against
the Japanese yen amidst rising fears that the United States'
economy may falter due to the global economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
A rise in commodity prices generally, and a bounce in gold
particularly, also aided the local currency's rise. Gold closed

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Successfully Issues Eurobonds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Amid the turmoil in world
financial market, Lebanon has successfully issued Eurobonds worth
350 million U.S. dollars on international debt market, the
National Broadcast Network radio reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-based financial group Merrill Lynch was charged to
issue the bonds carrying an interest rate of 8.75 percent over a
seven-year period, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
The issue, which was launched in London on Tuesday and closed
on Thursday, had met with strong demand. About 90 percent of the
bonds were bought by Lebanese investors, maily banks, and other
Middle East buyers.
</P>
<P>
Due to the financial storms gripping international market,
Lebanese government originally expected to issue at most 250
million dollars. But higher than expected demand raised the figure
to as high as 350 million dollars, a banking source here said.
</P>
<P>
This is the second issue so far this year, after the last
successful 1 billion dollars Eurobond borrowing in March.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese government decided last November to borrow a total of 2
billion dollars on international markets within this year to
restructure national debt, which is predominated by the high
interest rate Lebanese pound.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon's national debt at the end of June totaled 15.5
billion dollars, of which nearly 70 percent is internal debt.
</P>
<P>
Banking sources predicted that Lebanon is likely to launch
another borrowing in the world market before the end of this
year.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Uganda should pull out its
troops from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) first because
it came first, the Zimbabwean defense minister said.
</P>
<P>
Moven Mahachi made the remarks in Addis Ababa Thursday at a
ministerial meeting on the situation in the DRC, the New Vision
daily reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Mahachi hoped that this meeting will work out a mechanism for
a cease-fire in the war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
Uganda and Rwanda have been accused of backing the Tutsi
rebels in the DRC. Rwanda denied any military involvement in the
conflict while Uganda admitted it has troops in the eastern part
of Democratic Congo.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia sent troops to prop up the
government of DRC President Laurent Kabila in mid-August, turning
the tide of the war against the rebels who were advancing to
capital Kinshasa.
</P>
<P>
The meeting of defense ministers is a follow-up to the
regional summit in the Zimbabwean resort town of Victoria Falls
earlier this week which ended with a commitment to seek for a
cease-fire in the DRC but without any concrete timetable.
</P>
<P>
As the war in the DRC continues to regionalize, more and more
regional and international attention has been directed to the
third largest African country.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the United Nations sent two military
advisers to the ministerial meeting in Addis Ababa.

<HEADLINE> Zambians Opt for Harare Coke </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Cheaper imported soft drinks
from Zimbabwe may soon flood the Zambian market following the
recent hiking of the price of soft drinks made in Zambia by
Coca-Cola Company by 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Zambians now prefer to buy Zimbabwe-made drinks whose cost
is equivalent to 200 Zambian Kwacha (one U.S. Dollar equals to
2,000 Kwacha), Times of Zambia said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Zambian traders of soft drinks threatened to stop buying
minerals from Zambia Bottlers Limited, Zambian manufacturer of
Coca-Cola, preferring instead to source them from Zimbabwe where
they would still be assured of a profit margin after paying duty.
</P>
<P>
Should that happen the future of Zambia Bottlers Limited would
be threatened with the likelihood of the company's closing its
operations in Zambia.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted company managing director Ian Ackerman as
saying Thursday that closure of the firm was a possibility but
adding quickly that he did not want to think about it.
</P>
<P>
Coca-Cola raised the price of its products last Monday from
500 to 900 Kwacha each bottle after the Zambian government failed
to honor the agreement concluded with the company last May, under
which the Zambia authorities agreed to reduce the excise duty of
the soft drinks from 20 to five percent while Coca-Cola pledged
to invest 75 million U.S. Dollars in the country.
</P>
<P>
Coca-Cola said earlier this week it would suspend its plan to
invest on a new production line and scale down its operations in
Zambia, which may make thousands of local workers lose their
jobs.
</P>
<P>
Also on Thursday, the Zambia Association of Soft Drinks
Manufacturers said the excise duty on soft drinks has crippled
the country's industry.
</P>
<P>
It reiterated its call on the government to revise the May
agreement with Coca-Cola and reduce the tax which has had a
devastating effect on the industry and the Zambian economy.

<HEADLINE> Liberia's Taylor Claims Coup Plot Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Liberian President Charles
Taylor has accused the West African peace-keeping force ECOMOG
and the Sierra Leonean government of plotting to overthrow him.
</P>
<P>
Talyor told the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) that
ECOMOG's commander in Sierra Leone, Brigadier-General Maxwell
Khobe had met with Sierra Leonean Deputy Defense Minister, Chief
Sam Hinga Nirman at a barrack in Freetown where they discussed
ways to topple him.
</P>
<P>
Taylor also named Guinean President Alfa Omar Konare as one of
the plotters, claiming that Konare had contacted Nigerian leader
General Abdulsalam Abubakar for permission to use Nigerian troops
in the plot.
</P>
<P>
According to Taylor, the request was refused by Abubakar.
</P>
<P>
The Liberian president said that under the plot as uncovered
by his government, the plotters had planned to assassinate him in
an all out attack on the executive mansion and the Liberian
Defense Headquarters.
</P>
<P>
Taylor also accused Rossevelt Johnson, his rival during the
civil war, of being part of the plot.
</P>
<P>
He said the Liberian government is in possession of a written
evidence to show that Johnson, while in the U.S., had contacted
the Liberian ambassador to the U.S. on the alleged coup plot.
</P>
<P>
In a swift reaction, Brigadier-General Khobe, a Nigerian who
is also the Chief of Defense Staff of Sierra Leone, denied
knowledge of any plot to assassinate or overthrow Taylor.
</P>
<P>
"Liberians are too many to kill Taylor if they want to, it's
not for us or any external body to do that," Khobe told the BBC.
</P>
<P>
Taylor had accused Guinea and the ECOMOG of plotting to
overthrow him in early August.

<HEADLINE> Figures Show Drop in Foreign Trade Growth Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Customs statistics released
today revealed a declining growth rate for China's imports and
exports during the first eight months of this year due to the
influences of the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
China's import-export volume hit 205.91 billion US dollars for
the period, up 3.3 percent on the 1997 period. Exports grew 5.5
percent to 118.65 billion US dollars, with imports rising by 0.4
percent to 87.26 billion, according to the data.
</P>
<P>
The nation's accumulated trade surplus stood at 31.38 billion
US dollars, up 22.7 percent over the year-ago period.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the growth rate of China's exports fell by 1.4
percentage points with accompanying 0.3 percentage points drop for
imports when compared to January-July period last year.

up 0.71 percent, while the imports topped 44.9 billion US dollars,
up 0.6 percent over the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government's reinstatement of preferential policies
covering imports of equipment and goods for investment purposes
yielded funds totalling 10 billion US dollars during the first
eight months, up 3.2 percent. Experts contend the move further
balanced China's trade activities.
</P>
<P>
Exports to Japan, the Republic of Korea (ROK) and ASEAN
nations continued to decline, with imports from the European

<HEADLINE> Kaunda's Son Under Police Probe in Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Zambian police is probing
Wezi Kaunda, one of Zambia's former president Kenneth Kaunda's
sons, to find out if he is training men abroad to oust President
Frederick Chiluba, a leading independent paper said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Wezi Kaunda disclosed in Lusaka Thursday that the government
of the ruling Movement for Multi-party Democracy (MMD) is
alleging that he is training guerrillas in Angola and South
Africa with a view to returning to topple President Chiluba,
according to The Post.
</P>
<P>
He told the paper that he has received information from
several local and international intelligence sources that the
Zambian government is alleging he is training guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
The former army major explained the fact that he has
maintained contacts with military commanders in neighboring
countries does not mean that he is training guerrillas, adding he
is not going to cut those contacts overnight to please the
government.
</P>
<P>
Wezi Kaunda, also chairman of Lusaka District of the
opposition United National Independence Party (UNIP), also
disclosed that on Thursday a combined team of Zambia Police
Criminal Investigations Department officers and a paramilitary
officer swooped on the house of a UNIP ward chairman in the
capital city to try to search for firearms and security forces
uniforms.
</P>
<P>
He, who has had several swoops on his house and offices since
the MMD came into power in 1991, described this as "the beginning
of another Zero Option", the alleged code name of operations by
the UNIP to topple the MMD government.
</P>
<P>
In 1993, security agents raided Wezi Kaunda's office and house
in search of Zero Option documents. He together with some other
senior UNIP officials was subsequently detained but was released
unconditionally after a lengthy trial.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Multinational Firms Increasing Investment in China (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Many world-famous multinational
enterprises have greatly increased their investments in China,
according to the ongoing Second China Investment and Trade Fair
in Xiamen, a seaport city in east China's Fujian Province.
</P>
<P>
Latest statistics show that more than 1,800 contracts have so
far been signed, including an increasing number of large projects.
</P>
<P>
These large projects have attracted 75.8 percent of the total
investment of 11.5 billion U.S. dollars, and 73.9 percent of the
8.23 billion U.S. dollars of foreign investment already used.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts attribute this to the active participation of
such multinational corporations as Motorola, Nokia, Exxon, Mobil,
Sony and Siemens.
</P>
<P>
China implemented a series of preferential policies to
encourage direct foreign investment this year in a bid to counter
the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
State councillor Wu Yi said about the fair, "Multinational
enterprises are vital powerhouses promoting the world economy,
and the Chinese government welcomes their investment."
</P>
<P>
To attract more foreign capital, China will further open its
domestic market, promote cooperation between state-run large- and
medium-sized enterprises and foreign companies, and encourage
national firms to establish research centers together with their
foreign counterparts.

Statistics show that the contractual value of foreign-funded
projects in the first seven months of 1998 reached 28 billion U.S.

accounted for a considerable portion of this.
</P>

it is going to execute the plan. He did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
Iran has massed over the past few days up to 70,000 troops
along the border with Afghanistan to put more pressure to bear on
the Taliban for the release of the Iranians taken captive in
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Tehran claimed that 11 diplomats and a correspondent of the
official news agency were captured by the Taliban troops taking
over Mazar-e-Sherif, a stronghold of the opposition Northern
Alliance which Iran supports.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban had repeated denied it knew the whereabouts of the
missing Iranians. But the latest confirmation of the tragic fate
of these diplomats outraged the Iranian government, making a
retaliatory strike or even a military incursion all the more
possible than before, analysts here said.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani said Iran's policy toward Afghanistan - to let the
Afghan people solve their own problems - remained unchanged and
Tehran still recognizes the government led by ousted President
Burhanuddin Rabbani as the legal government of Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Rabbani, who also appeared at the prayers, accused the Taliban,
who drove him out of capital Kabul in 1996, and now won control
over most of Afghanistan and imposed a strict version of Islamic
rule, of "defying all values and principle."
</P>
<P>
The Taliban, a religious student militia, was reportedly backed
by Pakistan in its swift rise to prominence and sweeping victory
in war-torn Afghanistan.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Li Peng, chairman of the
Standing Committee of the Chinese National People's Congress
(NPC), met here today with a delegation of the Vietnamese
Association for Peace.
</P>
<P>
The delegation is led by Vu Dinh Cu, vice-chairman of the
Vietnamese National Assembly and president of the association.
</P>
<P>
Li said that as close neighbors, China and Viet Nam experienced
similar hardships in the past, and today they are both building
socialism, developing their national economies, and safeguarding
regional stability and world peace.
</P>
<P>
These common points serve as the basis for bilateral
good-neighborliness and cooperation between the two countries, and
also constitute as the basic common interest of the two peoples.
</P>
<P>
Both the Communist Party of China (CPC) and the Chinese
government attach great importance to friendship with Viet Nam, Li
said, noting that since the normalization of bilateral ties,
high-level contacts have been frequent, and sound cooperation has
been carried out in various spheres, and longstanding traditional
friendship has been tightened.
</P>
<P>
The world has entered an era of high-technology, and so long as
the two countries learn from and communicate with each other,
their mutually beneficial cooperation will certainly go forward,
Li said.
</P>
<P>
Vu said he witnessed the great achievements China had scored in
socialist construction during his current visit, especially in the
scientific and technological sector, and expressed the hope that
bilateral cooperation in this regard will increase.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed his solicitude to the people in China's
flooded areas, and said China's victory over the disastrous
flooding is resultant from the correct leadership of the CPC and
the full-play of the advantages of the socialist system.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Real GDP Drops for Three Straight Quarters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Japan's gross domestic product
(GDP) in the second quarter of this year shrank by 0.8 percent
from the previous quarter in real terms, or an annualized decline
of 3.3 percent, the Economic Planning Agency (EPA) said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The contraction marks the third consecutive quarterly fall. It
is the first time that Japan's GDP has declined for three straight
quarters since the end of World War II.
</P>
<P>
Private consumption, which accounts for some 60 percent of the
GDP aggregate, fell 0.8 percent, and corporate capital spending,
another engine for growth, declined 5.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Housing investment fell 1 percent, while public investment
increased 0.1 percent, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
With this data, it has become increasingly difficult for Japan
to achieve the government's target growth rate of 1.9 percent for
the current fiscal year, said Taichi Sakaiya, director general of
the agency.
</P>
<P>
GDP measures the value of goods and services produced within a
nation. Real GDP figures are adjusted for inflation and seasonal
variations.

<HEADLINE> Howard Sees Tight Election Ahead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Australian Prime Minister
John Howard Friday refused to be carried away by an opinion poll
that found support for the opposition dropping, saying, "This is
going to be a tight election and I don't take anything for
granted."
</P>
<P>
The latest AC Nielsen poll published in the Sydney Morning
Herald Friday found that backing for the opposition Australian
Labor Party (ALP) had fallen behind the ruling Australian Liberal
Party and National Party coalition in the early stages of the
election campaign.
</P>
<P>
It said the ALP's primary vote dropped 3 points to 39 percent
while the coalition remained steady at 43 percent. Support for One
Nation Party was static at 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
"I read them but I'm not going to comment," Howard said, when
asked if he was buoyed by the poll. "I think there is a long way
to go, we've got three weeks."
</P>
<P>
Australia plans to hold federal election on October 3.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, another poll, the Morgan poll, put Labor ahead of
the coalition for the fourth consecutive week and said the ALP
would have won a federal election held last weekend.
</P>
<P>
The poll put support for Labor at 53.3 percent on a two-party
preferred basis, a fall of 2 percent, while support for the
coalition rose two points to 46.5 percent.

<HEADLINE> Share Prices Plummet in Tokyo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices tumbled in Tokyo
Friday following the steep drop on Wall Street overnight,
heightening concerns about a global stock decline.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange lost 749.05 points, or 5.11
percent, from Thursday's close to end at 13,916.98.
</P>
<P>
Last-minute bargain-hunting kept the Nikkei index from
finishing below its 12-year closing low of 13,915.63 marked August
28, when Russia's financial crisis spurred a worldwide sell-off of
shares, trader said.
</P>
<P>
While the steep fall in Wall Street overnight triggered the
decline, stocks were also pushed down by the settlement of
September Nikkei index options and futures contracts, which
traders said apparently ended in a negative balance of shares.
</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering all
First Section issues, declined 38.43 points or 3.46 percent to
1,071.48.
</P>
<P>
Turnover on the major section came to an estimated 1.25 billion
shares, nearly four times the amount traded Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Nippon Steel was the day's most heavily traded issue.
</P>
<P>
Of the 1,341 issues listed on the First Section, losers
outweighed gainers 1,062 to 156, with 84 issues ending unchanged.
</P>
<P>
On the Tokyo Foreign Exchange, the U.S. dollar plunged against
the yen on fears for the stability of the U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
The dollar was quoted at 130.76-79 yen at 5 p.m. (local time),
sharply down from 133.75-78 yen at 9 a.m. in Tokyo, and from
134.45-55 yen late Thursday in New York. The dollar briefly
dropped to 128.80 yen, its lowest level in Tokyo in five months.

<HEADLINE> IBM Chairman Addresses China's Needs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Developing software and
services for an information technology (IT) industry will be
"critical" for China's effort to restructure state-owned
enterprises and modernization drive, according to IBM Chairman and
CEO Louis Gerstner.
</P>
<P>
The IBM executive made the comments today during an address to
over 400 clients, business partners and members of the press. He
also noted that China's existing IT industry is based on hardware
manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
He said China is embarking on an extraordinary new stage in
restructuring enterprises and noted the unprecedented
transformation has never before been witnessed in other countries.
</P>
<P>
Gerstner pointed out that developing a software and services IT
industry will be critical for the success of the transformation
effort and serves as the catalyst, foundation and tool for
developing modern management systems.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Chinese government should play a key role in
developing the software and service industry. He noted that
contacts with Chinese authorities have revealed their full
awareness that economic reform goes well beyond the structural
alliances of enterprises. "It will require hard work to rework
enterprise systems," according to Gerstner.
</P>
<P>
Projections call for China to be the world's second largest PC
market by the year 2000. China's sales of computer hardware for
1997 exceeded 100 billion yuan (12 billion US dollars) and
accounted for 80 percent of the IT market. However, sales of
software and services accounted for a mere 20 percent of the
market.
</P>
<P>
Gerstner pointed out that services account for the major part
of IT industry in the West, with the sales volume for services far
outstripping the figure for software and hardware.
</P>
<P>
IBM, the world's leading IT service provider, recently signed
agreements with China's Ministry of Information Industry (MII) to
introduce Java, the most efficient language for writing software
programs, and for promoting component programming technology to
the country.
</P>
<P>
Gerstner expressed his belief that China offer vast prospects
for electronic information processing. He also noted that the
number of Internet in China has doubled to well over one million
in the past year, and predicted that the number will hit seven
million by 2001.

<P>
CANBERRA, September 11 (Xinhua) -- A record of more than 1,400
people will run for Australia's federal parliament in the October
3 election.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) said Friday that

</P>
<P>
They will contest 148 seats in the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
In the Senate, 329 candidates will contest 40 available seats,
74 more than those who contested the 1996 poll.
</P>
<P>
In Australia's first federal election in 1901, only 172 people
ran for the parliament.
</P>
<P>
New South Wales has the most aspiring politicians this year.
</P>
<P>
The Electoral Commission said 389 people from the state will
contest the 50 House of Representatives seats.
</P>
<P>
Victoria has 289 candidates for 37 seats while Queensland has
192 candidates for 27 seats.
</P>
<P>

at the election had topped 12 million for the first time in the
country, as 12,056,625 Australians had put their names on the roll
when enrollments officially closed on Monday, compared with
11,655,190 electors on the rolls for the 1996 election.

Dai made the comments during a recent meeting on the country's
current financial situation. He said that the volume of the money
supply should be appropriately raised to ensure this year's
economic growth target of eight percent. He added that the PBOC
has adopted a series of related measures during 1998.

For example, the fact that the volume of bank loans has
increased significantly on the same period last year has provided
strong support for economic development, said Dai.

He pointed out the management of foreign exchange will be
further strengthened and added that effective measures will be
introduced to crack down on all forms of illegal trade related to
foreign currency and for maintaining the stability of the Renminbi.

Dai said that financial reforms will be further deepened to

<HEADLINE> China's Central, Western Regions to Appeal to Overseas Investors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, September 11 (Xinhua) -- China's resource-rich central
and western region will have more substantial preferential
policies to attract overseas investment, according to a symposium
at the ongoing '98 China Investment and Trade Fair here.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the symposium, Ma Xiuhong, assistant minister of
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, said that China will
encourage overseas-invested enterprises based in the coastal area
to seek opportunities in the central and western regions of the
country, where a 25 percent overseas partnership will be treated
as an overseas-funded business and enjoy the same preferences.
</P>
<P>
In addition, a larger portion of overseas financing from
international financial institutions and foreign governments will
be funneled to projects in the western region, Ma noted.
</P>
<P>
China's central and western regions include 19 provinces,
regions and cities which boasts two-thirds of the country's
petroleum, natural gas and hydro-power resources, and 91 percent
of its major mine reserves.
</P>
<P>
Their share of overseas investment accounted for 14 percent of
the country's total last year, an increase of 8 percent since
1990. This has been attributed to lower product costs in these
regions, which is causing an increasing number of investors to
shift their focus from the east to the west.
</P>
<P>
There are a range of industries of large potential for overseas
investment, including agriculture, animal husbandry, mining, raw
material processing, infrastructure construction and tourism.
</P>
<P>
Ma said that backward infrastructure conditions in the central
and western regions are a major hurdle in attracting overseas
investment. In southern Yunnan Province for example, the railway
transportation capacity totals 10 million tons, in contrast to a
25 million-ton demand.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Central Bank Rushes to Rescue Falling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Bank of Uganda, the
country's central bank, has rushed to stabilize the Ugandan
Shilling which has been falling drastically fast over the last
couple of months.
</P>
<P>
Wlugembe Musoke, the director of public relations of the bank,
revealed to the press that his bank has intervened, but did not
elaborate on how much the bank has injected in the market,
according to a Monitor newspaper report Friday.
</P>
<P>
The bank will intervene as long as it is necessary, he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Dollar has for the past few months beaten the
Shilling over the head, with selling quotations jumping from
1,160 Shillings against the Dollar in February to 1,250 Shillings
in July. By Thursday evening, some foreign exchange bureaus were
quoting 1,300 Shillings against the Dollar.
</P>
<P>
Some economists blamed the depreciation of this currency to
the government's too much expenditure on non-economic ventures,
the instability in the Great Lakes region and the sharp fall of
coffee exports.
</P>
<P>
This sharp fall of Shilling may affect the country's ability
to service its debts, erode the country's exports on the
international market and hit hard producers of goods which
require a lot of imported raw materials, said Marios Obwona, a
senior economic research fellow with Makerere University.

KUALA LUMPUR, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Football
Confederation (AFC) Friday suspended Thailand and Indonesia from
all international football matches with immediate effect,
according to the Malaysian national news agency Bernama.

to the sport and image of Asian soccer" following a bizarre group
match during last week's Tiger Cup tournament in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
The AFC executive committee also ordered its Disciplinary
Board to conduct an inquiry into both teams and complete its
report by the end of next month.
</P>
<P>
AFC secretary-general Peter Velappan was quoted as saying both
nations would be suspended until AFC received the report.

<HEADLINE> Flood Situation Worsens Further in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The overall flood situation has
further worsened in the central part of Bangladesh and in and
around the capital city of Dhaka, disrupting the railway link
between the capital and three cities from Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Direct railway services between Dhaka and the second largest
city of Chittagong, northeastern and southeastern cities of Sylhet
and Noakhali have been canceled due to the rising of water level
by 20 centimeters in a section, press reports Friday quoted
officials as saying.
</P>
<P>
The situation in the capital is deteriorating further with
inundation of more residential and commercial areas and city
streets while the Dhaka-Narayanganj-Demra (DND) embankment and the
city protection embankment are under continuous threat with the
swelling of waters in the Buriganga, Sitalakhay and Turag rivers.
</P>
<P>
Apart from troops, engineers of the Water Development Board and
other departments concerned are working round the clock to repair
leakage, breaches and cracks in the DND embankment.
</P>
<P>
The flood situation in and around Dhaka city may get worse
during the next 24 hours because of flood waters from the upstream
of major rivers such as the Brahmaputra, Ganges and Meghna and
abnormal rise of tides in the Meghna estuary, according to the
Flood Forecasting and Warning Center.
</P>
<P>
In Dhaka, the southern half of the road connecting the
inter-city bus terminal with the city has been under knee-deep
water at two points near the terminal and flood water may cross
the road divider at any time.
</P>
<P>
The gushing flood waters have already entered the premises of
several foreign missions, which are located in the city's
northeastern areas of Gulshan, Banani and Baridhara.
</P>
<P>
The British High Commission has asked all its officials to
evacuate their children while the Australian Embassy urged its
members to evacuate their families.
</P>
<P>
The flood, which has lasted for more than two months, has
already affected about 30 million people in 47 of the country's 64
districts, with the flood-related death toll reaching 843 so far,
according to the Relief Ministry.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Eager to Meet Nigerian Leader at UN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 11 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
has expressed his eagerness to meet with Nigerian Head of State
General Abdusalam Abubakar during the 53rd session of the General
Assembly of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Ambassador to Nigeria William Twadell conveyed Clinton's
invitation in Abuja Thursday, when he met Abubakar who is
scheduled to attend the U.N. General Assembly Monday.
</P>
<P>
Twadell reportedly briefed the Nigerian leader on the reaction
of the U.S. government to the measures so far taken in the
Nigerian democracy process.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador assured that his government's position on the
positive development in Nigeria would be soon given practical
expression in many areas of joint efforts.
</P>
<P>
In his response, Abubakar expressed satisfaction with the
positive reaction of the international community, especially the
U.S. and the European Union to the measures taken by him to
establish a united, stable and prosperous democratic polity in
Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the measures being adopted by his government
were consistent with the aspirations of Nigerians for democracy
which has become a universal phenomenon too strong to ignore.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-Nigerian relations got soured in 1995 when the U.S.
and Western world slammed sanctions on Nigeria after former
government of late General Sani Abacha hanged author Ken
Saro-Wiwa and eight other minority activists on charges of
murder.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral relations between the two countries began to improve
soon after Abubakar taking office in June following the sudden
death of Abacha.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar has shown his commitment to democratize Nigeria in
his moves of releasing all political detainees, scraping the
discredited transition program of his predecessor and announcing
a new transition process, by which the military is bound to
return to barracks in May next year.

<HEADLINE> Security Issues Take Center Stage in Ross' Mission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 11 (Xinhua) -- As U.S. Middle East peace
envoy Dennis Ross' mission continues, his shuttles between Israeli
and Palestinian negotiators indicate that security issues take the
center stage in the talks.
</P>
<P>
Since his return to the region Wednesday, Ross has held two
rounds of talks with the Palestinians - one with Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat in Ramallah Wednesday, another with
Palestinian negotiators Abu Ala, Abu Mazen and Saeb Erekat here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Ross also met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
and President Ezer Weizman here Thursday, and held another meeting
with Netanyahu, together with his four inner cabinet ministers.
</P>
<P>
Those discussions showed that both the Palestinian and Israeli
negotiators focused their attention on the the U.S. proposal as a
package, looking at the specifics of such key issues as security
cooperation, along with Israel's troop redeployment in the West
Bank.
</P>
<P>
For Israel, security has become the key issue hindering the
peace process. It insisted that it will make no deal to advance
the process or accept the U.S. proposal on a 13 percent Israeli
withdrawal from the West Bank in the second stage redeployment
until the Palestinian side does more to fight terrorism.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side gave a different explanation of this
issue. Erekat said on Thursday that for Israeli-palestinian
security cooperation, there was a U.S. brokered Memorandum of
Understanding (MOU) that won the acceptance of security officials
from all sides last December, but Netanyahu scuttled it, opposing
the reference that required equal enforcement against extremism on
both Israeli and Palestinian sides.
</P>
<P>
He said that Israeli-Palestinian security cooperation must be
based on the MOU and Israel's acceptance of the MOU is the basis
for further security cooperation between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
He also insisted that Israel must accept "reciprocal
obligations on security" by enforcing the law against Israeli
extremists who kill Palestinians and afterwards are let out from
prison.
</P>
<P>
Reaching an agreement on this issue may take some time, but
the shooting and killing incidents continue. Israeli soldiers
shot to death two "Palestinian terrorists" in Hebron Thursday,
clamping a closure on the West Bank and Gaza Strip starting Friday
morning.
</P>
<P>
Kamale Nadher, a 41-year-old Palestinian women shot with a
rubber bullet by Israeli police Saturday at the Shufat Refugee
camp in northern Jerusalem, died and buried Thursday, leaving
four children behind.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Researcher Proposes Mach 10 Aircraft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, September 10 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. researcher has
come up with a design for a "HyperSoar" aircraft that could fly at
10,720 kilometers per hour, or Mach 10, according to a news
release Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Preston Carter, researcher in the U.S. Department of Energy's
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, said the key to HyperSoar
aircraft would be its "skipping" motion along the edge of Earth's
atmosphere, much as a rock skips across water.
</P>
<P>
After ascending to roughly 43,000 meters, just outside the
atmosphere, the aircraft would turn off its air-breathing engine
and coast back to the atmospheric edge, where it would quickly
fire its engines again and "skip" back into space, he explained in
the news release.
</P>
<P>
The researcher estimated that it would cost a total investment
of almost 500 million U.S. dollars to research and build a
one-third scale flyable prototype of the HyperSoar aircraft,
which, he said, would quickly prove its value.
</P>
<P>
"A commercial flight from the midwestern United States to Japan
would require approximately 25 such skips to complete the one-and-
a-half-hour journey," the new release said.
</P>
<P>
Scientists believe that HyperSoar aircraft could prove a boon
to the space program as the first stage of a two-stage launch
process, moving objects to just outside the Earth's atmosphere,
from which point they can be guided into their final
orbits.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Condemns Killing of Iranian Diplomats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan Friday condemned
the killing of nine Iranian diplomats based in northern
Afghanistan, but said it can not accept Iran's accusation that it
was responsible for the attack.
</P>
<P>
"Pakistan cannot accept this accusation as it cannot be held
responsible or accountable for the events in a third country," a
Foreign Office spokesman said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Iran said on Thursday that it holds the Afghan Taliban militia
and Pakistan responsible for the "abhorrent" killing of Iranian
diplomats after the Taliban announced that they had recovered the
bodies of the nine Iranian diplomats in the suburbs of
Mazar-e-Sharif.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman urged the Taliban regime to "expeditiously locate
the whereabouts of the remaining two members of the Iranian
consulate" in Mazar-e-Sharif, around 300 kilometers north of
Kabul.
</P>
<P>
He said the government of Pakistan hoped that those responsible
for this act would be apprehended and punished.
</P>
<P>
He also offered condolences to the bereaved families and the
government of Iran on behalf of the government and people of
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the tension that this tragic incident has
generated between Iran and Afghanistan, the spokesman urged the
two sides to exercise restraint and resolve their differences
through peaceful negotiations.

<HEADLINE> Global Chip Sales Down 17 Percent in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Worldwide semiconductor
sales in July fell 17 percent from the same month last year,
according to a report released on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Chip sales dropped to 9.66 billion U.S. dollars, compared to
11.65 billion dollars in July last year, said the U.S.
Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA) in the report.
</P>
<P>
SIA said that the drop was mainly due to continued economic
turmoil in Japan, whose chip sales plunged 30.2 percent in July,
and the oversupply of memory chips in world markets.
</P>
<P>
Sales in all major world markets declined in July from year-ago
totals.
</P>
<P>
Sales on the American market fell from 3.85 billion dollars to
3.20 billion dollars and Asia-Pacific slipped from 2.54 billion
dollars to 2.1 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Europe's sales held up better than other regions, with revenues
falling just 3.9 percent to 2.22 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
"A positive sign in the marketplace is that personal computer
sales continue to grow," the SIA report said. "The oversupply of
some semiconductor products has driven down the average selling
price of applications, but pricing will modify as demand balances
with capacity."

<HEADLINE> 200 Kenyans Stranded on Lake Victoria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 11 (Xinhua) -- About 200 Kenyans were
stranded on Lake Victoria for more than eight hours after the
three boats carrying them were trapped in thick mats of the water
hyacinth.
</P>
<P>
The three boats left Homa Bay, western Kenya, at around 10:00
a.m. Wednesday for various beaches along the Kenyan side of the
lake, but advancing mats of the weed blocked their paths,
eyewitnesses were quoted by Friday's Daily Nation as saying.
</P>
<P>
The passengers, most of them are women and children, were
still stranded in the lake until later afternoon. They shouted
for help and asked for food and water, which could not be
delivered to them.
</P>
<P>
But at around 6:30 p.m. on the day, strong winds pushed away
the weed and the three boats continued on their way.
</P>

A sentry at the Homa Bay pier said the passengers would have
no alternative but to sit in the boats and pray that strong winds
push away the weed, which has paralyzed transport and fishing in
the lake for years.
</P>
<P>
Incidents of boats getting trapped in the weed, he explained,
had become a common occurrence since the weed drifted from Kisumu
Port to beaches in Homa Bay and Rachuonyo districts three months
ago.
</P>
<P>
The majority of the people living around the lake use boats as
the only means of transport since the Kenya Railways Corporation
withdrew passenger steamers because of the hyacinth.

<HEADLINE> A Broad Based Afghan Government Called for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Turkey and Pakistan have
agreed that only the establishment of a broad based government in
Afghanistan can bring peace to the war-stricken country, a senior
Turkish official said.
</P>
<P>
The Daily News newspaper on Friday quoted the official, who
declined to be named, as saying that both Turkey and Pakistan are
concerned about the worsening situation there.
</P>
<P>
The official said that a high-level Turkish delegation headed
by Foreign Ministry Undersecretary Korkmaz Haktanir recently held
discussions with Pakistani officials in Islamabad on the latest
developments in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
He said that both sides are extremely uneasy about the
attitude of the Taliban, which they feel reflects "a medieval
mentality".
</P>
<P>
The Taliban, a student militia said to have Pakistani backing,
has won control over most of Afghanistan and imposed a strict form
of Islamic rule there.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani government has realized that the Taliban is bent
on "fighting to the bitter end" and this is a further source of
concern, The Turkish official added.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has stated that it will closely follow the developments
in Afghanistan and appoint a special "coordination ambassador" to
handle the matter.
</P>
<P>
Leading Afghan opposition figures, such as ousted President
Burhanuddin Rabbani, General Rashid Dostum and Abdulmalik Khan
have visited Ankara in recent weeks to discuss with Turkish
officials the current situation in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Turkey hates to see the domination of the Taliban in
Afghanistan for fear that an Islamic regime would export its
extremism to the neighboring Muslim countries.

LOS ANGELES, September 10 (Xinhua) -- U.S. health officials
Thursday urged the federal government to allocate 200 million
U.S. dollars a year to the Center for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDCP) for battles against diseases.
</P>
<P>
They said that since 1994 the center has uncovered outbreaks of
illnesses in its programs conducted in seven states, but the
government provided only about a third of the requested money.
</P>
<P>
The center is conducting a four-year program to identify new
and re-emerging killer diseases before they cause major outbreaks.
</P>
<P>
CDCP officials said several new threats, such as bird flu and
mad cow disease, have been reported since 1994.
</P>
<P>
"The threats have not gone away," warned Dr. James Hughes,

<HEADLINE> African Athletes Vow to Grab Golds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 11 (Xinhua) -- African athletes have
vowed to show the world they are a powerhouse when the 8th
Athletics World Cup opens Friday at Johannesburg Stadium.
</P>
<P>
More than 400 athletics stars from around the globe have
arrived at Johannesburg, who will compete for eight teams from
different continents in the quadrennial athletics showpiece.
</P>
<P>
The African men's team, two-time defending World Cup champions
and one of the favorites to take this year's World Cup team
trophy, recently renamed Nelson Mandela Trophy, is oozing with
confidence.
</P>
<P>
World 3,000m steeplechase record holder Bernard Barmasai
didn't mince his words when he promised Africa a gold medal.
</P>
<P>
"I am in great shape and I promise you nothing else but a
gold. I will be doing it for Africa in Africa," he told local
journalists.
</P>
<P>
Barmasai's countryman and current world 5,000m champion Daniel
Komen also promised to score gold in the first World Cup staged
on African soil.
</P>
<P>
Noting his event would be the second track event Friday,
Zambian Samuel Matete predicted he would be the first medalist of
the team.
</P>
<P>
"I don't expect the race to be very fast. We are all tired
after a long season but I will give it a big effort to contribute
to the defense of our title, and that includes winning a medal,"
Matete said.
</P>
<P>
On the first day of competition, the African men's team
expects five medals, which includes two golds - from Komen in the
5,000m and Kenyan Japhet Kimutai in the 800m.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the African women's team, which finished fourth in
last World Cup in 1994, is hoping to get into the top three this
time.

<HEADLINE> Unemployment Rate Falls in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The unemployment rate in the
Philippines fell to 8.9 percent in July from a record high of 13.3
percent in April this year, the National Statistics Office said
here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The office said the labor force was 1.5 million less than in
April this year, thus bringing the total number of the jobless
down by 1.5 million and reducing the unemployment rate.
</P>
<P>
However, this does not mean that the employment situation in
the country has improved, economists said. They added that the
labor force declined because about 758,000 more housewives,
students and disabled and retired persons chose to stay out of the
labor force.
</P>
<P>
The office added that 30.6 million persons joined the labor
force in July 1998, an increase of 439,000 people over July 1997.
Of the 439,000 people, 325,000 found jobs pushing the total
employment to 27.9 million.
</P>
<P>
Among the sectors, service saw the largest increase in
employment. It was followed by agriculture and industry, the
office said.

<HEADLINE> East China Poplar Tree Sets New Growth Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, September 11 (Xinhua) -- A poplar tree planted 21
years ago in east China's Jiangsu Province has reached a height of
40 meters and has a diameter of 88 centimeters.
</P>
<P>
The growth rate for the tree, an Italian Poplar, has set a new
maturation record in China. Experts from Canada, Italy and
Japan have conducted studies to determine factors leading to the
rapid maturation process.
</P>
<P>
The tree, the tallest in China, was planted at the Zhangxu Tree
Nursery in Suining County, Jiangsu Province, in 1976. The tree was
3.1 meter tall when planted.
</P>
<P>
The original sapling withered and was cut in the spring of
1977. The existing tree, which sprouted from the remaining stump,
grew to a height of 4.32 meters and had a diameter of 4.7 cm. by
1978. The following year the tree reached a height of 8.6 meters
and had a diameter of 16 centimeters.
</P>
<P>
The Poplar is still growing and the trunk diameter increases by
as much as one cm. annually.

<HEADLINE> Israel Seals off West Bank, Gaza Strip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Israel has clamped a
closure on the West Bank and Gaza Strip beginning Friday morning
and declared a nationwide security alert following the killing of
two Palestinian militants Thursday night by Israeli soldiers.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli army announced the decision Thursday night after
the two armed Palestinians were shot dead in an exchange of fire
with Israeli soldiers.
</P>
<P>
The soldiers went to the house of the Palestinians after
hearing sounds of explosions and gunshots, and then clashed with
them.
</P>
<P>
After the seal-off went into effect at 4:00 a.m., all
Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza were not allowed to enter
Israel. Meanwhile, Israeli army said its forces were put on extra
high alert, roadblocks were beefed up and reinforcements have been
dispatched.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio quoted the army as saying the two Palestinians
have been identified as Imad Awadallah and his brother, both
members of militant resistance group Hamas. The army said it had
found "a lot of weapons" following a search of their house.
</P>
<P>
Imad Awadallah, considered as one of the top four Hamas
military activists, escaped from a Palestinian jail in Hebron
last month after a four-month imprisonment on suspicion of
shooting dead Hamas master bomb-maker Muhei Sharif in March.
</P>
<P>
Israeli army said Imad and his brother were on their way to
carry out a major attack and the clash took place in an area under
full Israeli security control. But the exact location was kept
secret.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Thursday, a bus carrying Israeli religious students to
another West Bank town of Nablus was hit by gunfires but no one
was injured.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio reported Friday morning that Hamas officials in
Gaza had pledged to take revenge on the killing of the two
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The closure was declared as U.S. Middle East envoy Dennis Ross
was on a renewed mission here trying to bridge the gap between
Israel and the Palestinians over the long overdue Israeli
withdrawal from the West Bank.

<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, September 11 (Xinhua) -- UtiliCorp United, a U.S.
power company, has decided to buy Power New Zealand shares from
Mercury Energy and WEL Energy in order to control one of the
biggest
private-run electricity-generating companies in New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
The New Zealand Press Association (NZPA) reported Friday that
the move would allow UtiliCorp to increase its stake in Power New
Zealand from 37.5 percent to 78.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
UtiliCorp's offer price of 6.625 NZ dollars a share valued
Mercury's 33.2 percent Power New Zealand holding at 333.2 million
NZ
dollars (about 170 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The same price applied to WEL energy's 7.9 percent Power New
Zealand stake, valued at 79.7 million NZ dollars (40.5 million
U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
After the transactions, the Power New Zealand shareholding
would
comprise 78.6 percent held by UtiliCorp, 10.7 percent by the Power

New Zealand Shareholder Society, 9 percent by the public and 1.7
percent under the employee share ownership plan.
</P>
<P>
The NZPA quoted Mercury Energy chief executive Patrick Strange
as
saying the proposed agreement would provide "a practical and
mutually
beneficial outcome to what has become long-running ownership
struggle."
</P>
<P>
He added that the sales and purchases of shares would also help

"clarify issues of ownership and control."
</P>
<P>
Power New Zealand acting chairman Graeme Hawkins was quoted as
saying the deal would "benefit his company by streamlining
governance
issues."

<HEADLINE> New Zealand's Terms of Trade Worsen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, September 11 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand's terms of
trade
worsened in the second quarter of this year, according to figures

released recently by Statistics New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
An index, produced by Statistics New Zealand to measure the
relative value of exports and imports, declined by 4.1 percent in
the
second quarter and 1.2 percent in the year ending June 1998.
</P>
<P>
This was because export prices eased and import prices rose,
producing an overall worsening in the terms of trade.
</P>
<P>
The export price index, which feeds into the terms of trade
index,
eased 0.6 percent in the second quarter, after three quarterly
rises.
The import price index rose by 3.5 percent at the same time.
</P>
<P>
The New Zealand dollar fell 4.4 percent in the second quarter
and
13.9 percent in the year ending June 1998.
</P>
<P>
According to earlier reports, New Zealand wool prices went down
by
3.3 percent in the second quarter because of lower demand from
Asia.
Other significant falls in export prices occurred in chemicals and

related products, non-fuel crude materials, non-food manufactured
goods and petrol and petrol products.

<HEADLINE> Weak Asian Demand Cuts Port of Seattle's Grain Export </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Weak demand from Asia has
cut grain exports through the Port of Seattle to less than half
the volume of a year ago, Seattle Times reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
By the end of July, the port had exported 1.04 million metric
tons of grain, a 52 percent drop from the 2.16 million metric tons
logged during the same seven-month period last year.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, Washington State exported 5.6
billion U.S. dollars worth of agricultural goods to Asian
countries in 1996. For 1997, the state Agriculture Department
estimated Asian shipments fell by 478 million dollars because of
the region's financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Northwest agriculture had been one of the big
beneficiaries from Asia's booming economies. Its wheat was the
premier ingredient in some noodles, breads, fancy cakes and other
delicacies popular in some Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Wheat Commission estimates that 60 percent to 80
percent of the state's wheat went to Asia during the latter's
booming years.

<HEADLINE> 18.4 Million U.S. Households Participating in E-Commerce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Some 18.4 million
households in the United States make use of the Internet for their
shopping, according to a survey released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
More than 11 million households learn about products for
non-Internet purchases and 7.4 million shop for products to
purchase via online service or the Internet.
</P>
<P>
Most online American shoppers spend 20 hours or more each week,
learning about products that are then bought off-line or shopping
for products to be purchased online, said ZD Market Intelligence,
a market data provider in La Jolla, California.
</P>
<P>
The findings are based on a semi-annual survey of U.S. PC use
and users.
</P>
<P>
The study shows that Internet users and electronic-commerce
participants are similar in many ways. But the gap between these
two groups and the U.S. population as a whole widens when compared
side by side.
</P>
<P>
Online shoppers and Internet users tend to be younger, more
affluent and better-educated than the general U.S. population.
</P>
<P>
The biggest challenge in closing the e-commerce gap -- even
bigger than security, payment and standard issues -- is the fact
that more than half of households do not have PCs or Internet
access, according to the study. This fact has contributed greatly
to keeping e-commerce from reaching critical mass.
</P>
<P>
In addition to Internet penetration, bandwidth -- the
transmission capacity of a communications network -- presents
another challenge to e-commerce growth. Greater bandwidth is
crucial to creating positive consumer experience and therefore
enabling people to feel more confident participating in e-commerce
activities.
</P>
<P>
"Until there is a critical mass of PCs connected to the
Internet, e-commerce will continue to quickly outgrow the
infrastructure in place to support it," the study said.

motive.

</P>
<P>
-- Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz told a Cabinet meeting
Thursday that special attention must be paid to the missile
threats against Turkey from Iran, Syria and Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Farmers Take Interest in Reading </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, September 11 (Xinhua) -- As the gap between
urban and rural areas in China narrows, books are becoming
more popular among farmers.
</P>
<P>
A survey of 500,000 rural households in northern China's Hebei
Province shows that each of these households has at least 300
books and subscribes to two newspapers.
</P>
<P>
"Books are very useful," said Zhang Guizhen of Beijiao Village
in the suburbs of Shijiazhuang City in Hebei Province, adding that
she earned more than 10,000 yuan by raising pigs and cattle after
reading some books on the subject.
</P>
<P>
Some farmers in the more wealthy rural areas in south China
have begun to show an interest in English. "English corners" and
"English salons" are now appearing in some villages.
</P>
<P>
In Shaanxi and Hebei provinces, some farmers are able to talk
fluently with foreign visitors in English or Japanese while
engaging in tourism services.
</P>
<P>
In east China's Zhejiang Province, some fishermen take
popular English reading material with them while fishing on the open
sea, and read in their spare time.
</P>
<P>
Yuan Lichuan often fishes in the Atlantic Ocean and says he
could communicate with foreign fishermen after he had
learned some English.
</P>
<P>
"English is very helpful when we need to cooperate with foreign
counterparts in fishing," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese farmers' enthusiasm to pursue knowledge results in
improving educational levels for rural areas and helps farmers earn
more money, said an official from the Chinese Agriculture
Ministry.

<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, September 11 (Xinhua) -- A company in suburban
Luoyang in central China's Henan Province recently exported 1,350
peony stems worth about 100,000 yuan to northern European
countries.
</P>
<P>
This was the first such sale made by the Huafeng Peony
Horticulture Co. Ltd. through orders placed over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
The city of Luoyang has been growing peonies, a Chinese symbol
of prosperity, for more than 1,000 years, and now grows 5,000
varieties of the flower. The best peonies also come from Heze in
east China's Shandong Province.
</P>
<P>
With the aid of the Internet, the company has better marketing
prospects this year than previously, said manager Wu Jingxu.
</P>
<P>
A score of other overseas companies have also placed orders
through the Internet for 100,000 peony stems, according to Wu.

<HEADLINE> Moya, Philippoussis Advance to U.S. Open Semis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 10 (Xinhua) -- French Open champion Carlos
Moya of Spain needed just 90 minutes to beat Sweden's Magnus
Larsson 6-4, 6-3, 6-3 and advanced to the semifinals of the U.S.
Open tennis championships here today.
</P>
<P>
Unseeded player Mark Philippoussis of Australia edged Thomas
Johansson of Sweden 4-6, 6-3, 6-7 (3-7), 6-3, 7-6 (12-10) to take
the last semifinal berth tonight.
</P>
<P>
Moya will fight Philippoussis in the semifinal while Pete
Sampras of the United States takes on Rafter of Australia in
another Semifinal.
</P>
<P>
Moya faced just one break point the entire match and
controlled the battle from both the baseline and the net as he
became the first Spanish man to advance to the Open semifinals in
23 years.
</P>
<P>
He committed only 15 unforced errors and won 25-of-28 points
at the net. The 10th seed will meet the winner of tonight's
quarterfinal between unseeded players Mark Philippoussis of
Australia and Thomas Johansson of Sweden.
</P>
<P>
The 22-year-old Moya, last year's Australian Open runner-up,
was a little surprised that he won so easily.
</P>
<P>
"I was a little bit surprised, but I knew he had some problems
with his back, and these windy conditions was better for me," he
said. "I just tried to do my best. It was easier than I expected,
I have to say that."
</P>
<P>
In contrast, the big Swede struggled throughout the match with
41 unforced errors and seemed uncomfortable in the cold, windy
conditions.
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what happened out there," Larsson said. "He was
playing too good in these conditions. I had real problems with
the wind, as I usually have."
</P>
<P>
Moya closed out the match with his only ace of the day. He
advanced to the quarterfinals Monday night with a straight-set
victory over countryman Alex Corretja, but that is not indicative
of the hard road the Spaniard has had to travel.
</P>
<P>
Moya came back form two sets down and survived three match
points to take out American Michael Chang in the second round and
survived a fifth-set tiebreak with American Jan-Michael Gambill
in the third round.
</P>
<P>
Johansson and Philippoussis, who also have never faced each
other, both played in their first U.S. Open quarterfinal.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Military Leader Leaves on U.S. Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 11 (Xinhua) -- General Zhang Wannian,
vice-chairman of China's Central Military Commission (CMC), left
here this morning on an official visit to the United States at the
invitation of U.S. Secretary of Defence William Cohen.
</P>
<P>
Zhang's party includes Lieutenant General Xiong Guangkai,
deputy chief of general staff of the Chinese People's Liberation
Army (PLA), Shi Yunsheng, commander of the PLA Navy, Li Xinliang,
commander of the PLA Beijing Garrison, and Qiao Qingchen,
deputy-commander of the PLA Air Force.
</P>
<P>
Military Sources here cited it as an important visit at the
time when Sino-US relations tuned on a good growth momentum as a
result of an exchange of successful visits by the presidents of
the two nations.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, General Zhang is expected to meet with US
governmental and military leaders and Congressmen, and confer with
Cohen on global and regional security, relations between the two
countries and their armies as well as other issues of common
concern.
</P>
<P>
Besides talks and meetings, General Zhang and his party will
also visit units and academies of the US army, navy and air force,
which are believed to help increase mutual understanding and trust
and promote the Sino-US ties and military relations.
</P>
<P>
Upon his leaving for the U.S., General Zhang and his party were
seen off at the airport by General Fu Quanyou, member of the CMC
and chief of the PLA General Staff, and Lieutenant General Dong

<HEADLINE> Philippines Rules Out Foreign Exchange Controls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada has ruled out the adoption of foreign exchange controls
akin to those imposed last week by Malaysia to ward off
anti-currency attacks.
</P>
<P>
A presidential press release Friday quoted the president as
saying the adoption of foreign exchange controls might only spawn
more speculative attacks on the Philippine peso and, worse,
restore a dollar black market similar to the one that hit the
country in the past.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Malaysian government pegged its currency, the
ringgit, to a fixed exchange rate against the U.S. dollar and
imposed other foreign exchange controls in a bid to shield the
country's markets from foreign speculators.
</P>
<P>
Estrada told the Manila Overseas Press Club Thursday night that
Malaysian-style currency restrictions are not needed because "we
are more economically stable than Malaysia today."
</P>
<P>
He said, moreover, that his economic and budget managers have
already put in place four measures to parry anti-currency attacks
fueled by the deepening Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
To dampen anti-peso attacks, Estrada said, the government has
already initiated an austerity or belt-tightening program along
with measures to prune the budget deficit, cut wanton public
spending and upgrade tax collection.
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe we have to follow the steps of Prime Minister
Mahathir (Mohamad). We are more economically stable than Malaysia
today. We don't need currency controls because it might trigger
more speculative attacks on the peso," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that there is no need for currency controls because
"the after-effect of currency controls might even be the rise of a
black market on dollars. We have experienced that before."

<P>
NANJING, September 11 (Xinhua) -- East China's Jiangsu Province
at the lower reaches of the Yangtze River has imposed a sand
dredging ban in its 425-kilometer-long section of the river.
</P>
<P>
An official with the provincial people's congress said the ban
is being imposed to meet with anti-flood requirements and ensure
river stability.
</P>
<P>
A regulation just adopted by the provincial people's congress
stipulates that anyone violating the ban will have their
sand-dredgers confiscated and be subject to fines of between
10,000 yuan (1,200 U.S. dollars) and 100,000 yuan (12,000
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The judicial department will investigate into the criminal
responsibility of those whose sand dredging causes serious damage
to the river embankment, the local regulation says.
</P>
<P>
Excessive sand dredging in Jiangsu Province in the past few
years has resulted in several river-bank collapses, threatening
shipping safety along the Yangtze and the safe operation of the
river wharves.
</P>
<P>
More than 300 large- and medium-sized wharves have been built
along the Yangtze at Jiangsu Province.

<HEADLINE> Iran Calls for U.N. Reaction Taliban's Killing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister
Kamal Kharrazi Thursday night urged the United Nations Security
Council to show its reaction to the killing of Iranian diplomats
by the Afghan Taliban militia.
</P>
<P>
According to the official news agency IRNA, Kharrazi made the
call in a telephone conversation with chairman of the Security
Council. He deemed the Taliban's killing as "an obvious crime of
war against human being," and urged the Security Council should
take responsibility to tackle the war crime.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi also called on the Security Council to put pressure on
the Taliban to hand over the bodies of the killed Iranian
diplomats, to put the killers on trial and to release all Iranians
captured by the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban confirmed on Thursday that nine of the 11 Iranian
diplomats and an IRNA correspondent missing in northern
Afghanistan have been killed by "renegade forces," and their
bodies have been found.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Iranian ambassador to the U.N. Hadi Husseinian on
Thursday presented a letter of the Iranian government to
U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan, asking for the arrest and
extradition of those responsible to Iran.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian government expresses surprise and anger to such a
"crime which showed the Taliban's insult to the internationally
recognized norms and laws, and its ignorance to the fundamental
principles of the human being," the letter said.
</P>
<P>
The letter called on the U.N. Security Council to hold
emergency meeting to discuss the issue and take urgent and
necessary measures.
</P>
<P>
It stressed that the killing of Iranian diplomats was an
evident insult and violation of Iran's sovereignty by the
Taliban, who should bear the consequences of their behaviors.
</P>
<P>
Iran has massed over the past few days up to 70,000 troops
along the border with Afghanistan to put more pressure on the
Taliban, and analysts say an Iranian retaliatory military strike
or even an incursion can not be excluded.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council on Thursday issued a statement condemning
the Taliban for killing Iranian diplomats and called the act a
violation of international laws.
</P>
<P>
The statement also called on the Taliban to immediately
release other Iranians it held, and expressed the hope that Afghan
warring parties could solve the crisis through peaceful means.

<HEADLINE> Yunnan Province Bans Logging </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Logging of natural forests in
the Jinsha River Valley, southern China's Yunnan Province, will be
illegal as of October 1.
</P>
<P>
Local sources indicate the ban on logging will be carried out
in conjuction with the initiation of an extensive afforestation
program.
</P>
<P>
Jinsha River, a tributary in the upper reaches of the Yangtze
River, flows through 73 Yunnan cities and counties. The
mountainous valley is home to millions of hectares of forest and
various rare animal and plant species.
</P>
<P>
Forest coverage has dwindled rapidly since the 1960s due to
excessive logging which has created serious erosion and harmed
farmland. The fact that over 260 million tons of soil and sand
which flow from the valley into the middle and lower reaches of
the Yangtze River on an annual basis has at least in part been
blamed for heavy flooding.
</P>
<P>
The constantly deteriorating natural environment, especially
this summer's devastating floods, has placed experts and
provincial leaders on a high state of alert.
</P>
<P>
The province will adopt measures to protect forests covering
7.49 millions hectares, carry out afforestation projects on an
additional 3.5 million hectares, designate over 700,000 hectares
of hillside forests as protected areas and reforest 800,000
hectares in the valley. enditem

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Tries to Deal with Regional Financial Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The Myanmar government has
initiated some measures in an effort to lessen the impact of the
regional financial and monetary crisis.
</P>
<P>
The New Light of Myanmar said in an editorial on Friday that
the government is encouraging the increase of production in goods
and services while taking austerity measures by cutting state
expenses.
</P>
<P>
The government is also giving more attention to increasing
exports while restricting non-essential imports and implementing a
more efficient taxation system.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar is watching with great concern the development in the
financial and exchange markets in the region, the editorial said,
adding there has been a serious pressure on the currencies of the
neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, the impact on Myanmar of the currency turmoil in
the region has been slight up till now, it said.
</P>
<P>
In this regard, Myanmar feels that the existing inequitable and
outdated international monetary and financial system needs a
comprehensive reform, the editorial said, voicing support for the
call made for the first time in 1983 at the New Delhi Non-Aligned
Movement (NAM) Summit to convene an international conference on
money and finance for development in the very near future.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar's support for the move was expressed by the country's
Foreign Minister U Ohn Gyaw when he attended the NAM Summit held
in Durban, South Africa, early this month.
</P>
<P>
The regional financial crisis prompted a rise in commodity
prices and a drop in the exchange rate of the Myanmar currency
Kyat against the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said that the financial storm affected Myanmar's
foreign trade and investment to some extent, bringing about a
trade deficit of 1.24 billion dollars in the 1997-98 fiscal year
which ended in March and a fall of 1 billion dollars in foreign
investment in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The crisis is also seen as a factor which hindered Myanmar's
endeavors to achieve the targeted growth of 6.4 percent in its
gross domestic product in 1997-98, which increased by only 4.6
percent.

<HEADLINE> Land Tax Aimed at Speculator, Not Public: Thai Ministry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The Finance Ministry of
Thailand has urged the general public to accept the proposed land
tax increases, saying they are aimed mainly at land speculators
and not ordinary people, the Bangkok Post said Friday.
</P>
<P>
People who buy land and buildings for speculative purposes
would be hardest hit by the changes, as the tax would be doubled
every three years on undeveloped land, the newspaper quoting
Supachai Pisitvanich, the ministry's permanent secretary as
saying.
</P>
<P>
According to the new land taxation, there will be five classes
of tax rates, with each class divided into three categories:
highly developed, intermediate, and underdeveloped.
</P>
<P>
A highly developed area in class 1 would face the highest tax
rate, 0.095 percent of appraised value. Underdeveloped areas in
class 5 would be charged the lowest rate, 0.025 percent.
</P>
<P>
Property location will determine the taxation class and Bangkok
alone will be placed in class 1.
</P>
<P>
Thus, Supachai explained, a person who owned one Rai (0.16
hectare) of highly-developed property in Bangkok, appraised at 1
million baht (25,000 U.S. dollars), would pay 950 baht (23.75
dollars) a year in tax.
</P>
<P>
To alleviate the burden of the public, tax increases proposed
for land and buildings would be phased in over up to five years.
</P>
<P>
The five-year phase-in would apply to taxpayers with bills of
1,000 baht (25 dollars) or more.
</P>
<P>
For example, the owner of a prime site in central Bangkok could
be paying as little as 2,500 baht (62.5 dollars) a year at
present.
</P>
<P>
Under the new law, the tax would jump to nearly 30,000 baht
(750 dollars). The taxpayer could double his payments in the first
three years, to 5,000, 10,000 and 20,000 baht (125, 250 and 500
dollars), and begin paying 30,000 baht in the subsequent years.

<HEADLINE> Australian Wool Prices Continue to Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Australian wool prices
continued to fall this week with prices at auctions in Sydney and
Adelaide dropping by close to two percent on average, and the
market is expected to come under severe pressure next week.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Council of Wool Exporters (ACWE) said in its
weekly report Friday that the eastern market indicator fell 10
cents to end the week at 527 Australian cents a kilogram clean.
</P>
<P>
"Similar falls of 10 cents occurred in both the northern and
southern region indicators which saw them finish at 533 and 521
cents/kilogram clean respectively," ACWE said.
</P>
<P>
The western region indicator remained at 496 cents per kilogram
clean with no sale in Fremantle, a coastal city in western
Australia.
</P>
<P>
Altogether 56,388 bales were offered for sale with 14 percent
passed in comprising 12.3 percent in Sydney and 15.6 percent in
Adelaide, capital of South Australian state.
</P>
<P>
ACWE said there had been no change in the global demand
situation which continued to be the dominant factor for the
current disappointing level of prices.
</P>
<P>
"In this environment, the market is expected to come under
further severe pressure next week where the rostered offering is
more than double the quantity offered this week," ACWE said.
</P>
<P>
Next week 117,000 bales will be up for sale in Sydney,
Melbourne and Fremantle, the largest offering of the season to
date.

<HEADLINE> China Speeds Railway, Highway Construction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 11 (Xinhua) -- China has accelerated the
pace of railway and highway construction this year in a bid to
give impetus to increasing the gross domestic product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
The central government recently added another 4.2 billion yuan
(506 million U.S. dollars) to railway investment, bringing the
total for this year to 53 billion yuan (6.39 billion
U.S. dollars). An investment of 41.3 billion yuan (4.98 billion
U.S. dollars) will be put into the construction of large- and
medium-sized projects, laying 1,876 kilometers of railroad tracks,
building 1,210 kilometers of new rail lines, 575 kilometers of
double-track lines, and 1,091 kilometers of electric railways.
</P>
<P>
A total of 21.76 billion yuan (2.62 billion U.S. dollars) was
invested in 39 large- and medium-sized projects and a dozen new
projects by the end of August. The Ministry of Railways noted that
work in the next four months will exceed that of the past eight
months.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, efforts are being made to intensify the construction
of 16 priority projects, including the double-track line on the
southern section of the Beijing-Kowloon railway, and the
electrification of the Chengdu-Kunming railway, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Communications said that investment in highway
construction reached 86.2 billion yuan (10.39 billion
U.S. dollars) in the past eight months, a jump of 82 percent over
the same 1997 period. At present, 3.04 million Chinese are
employed in highway construction.
</P>
<P>
The ministry scheduled 319 highway projects for this year to a
total length of 38,500 kilometers, including 12,700 expressways
and 4,372 kilometers of high-grade highways.
</P>
<P>
Experts believe that 0.31 percentage points will be added to
the growth of the GDP by investing 180 billion yuan (21.69 billion
U.S. dollars) in highway construction this year.

<HEADLINE> Worldwide PC Sales Rebound </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Worldwide personal
computer (PC) sales are expected to grow 12.2 percent for the
second half of 1998 despite the financial instability in Asia and
Russia, according to a report released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
PC sales grew 11 percent last quarter, reflecting a "warming"
of the global market, said the U.S. market research firm
International Data Corporation (IDC).
</P>
<P>
Most PC vendors have resolved the inventory gluts which led to
fire-sale prices and shrinking profit margins in the first half of
the year, IDC said.
</P>
<P>
Despite ongoing currency problems in Asian and eastern European
markets, PC sales appear to be stabilizing. IDC expects the market
to perform better in the next six months with improved demand for
low-cost and portable PCs.
</P>
<P>
While the market signals a possible bright future, IDC is still
worried that the spread of global economic problems might bring a
decline in PC demand.
</P>
<P>
IDC described western Europe as a promising market, driven by
heightened interest in the Internet, low-cost PCs as well as
greater focus on the region by major global brands.
</P>
<P>
U.S. growth this quarter is pegged at 14 percent based on the
continued strength of the low-cost PC market, healthy consumer
demand and a more vibrant portable computer segment, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
However, sales in the Asia-Pacific region (excluding Japan) are
forecast to fall three percent this quarter and nearly two percent
for the entire year. Japan is expected to decline four percent
this year.

<HEADLINE> Northwest Pilots Strike to End </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Negotiators for Northwest
Airlines and its pilots reached an agreement Thursday on a deal,
paving the way for an end to the pilots strike that has grounded
the U.S. airline for 13 days.
</P>
<P>
"I think the strike is over," President Bill Clinton announced
at the White House after speaking by phone with leaders from the
pilots' union and the company.
</P>
<P>
The president called union president J. Randolph Babbitt and
Northwest chief executive John Dasburg as the parties were in the
final phase of talks and urged them to "get it done and to get
back to work as soon as possible", an administration official said.
</P>
<P>
But Northwest's 6,100 pilots will remain on strike until at
least Saturday, when the Airline Pilots Association's executive
board will meet to consider the proposal. They will either approve
it or send it to the striking pilots for vote.
</P>
<P>
However, the company began calling ground workers back from
being laid off.
</P>
<P>
The breakthrough came during overnight negotiations, as the
National Mediation Board's Maggie Jacobsen kept discussions going
until 4 a.m. (local time) Thursday. Bruce Lindsey, one of
Clinton's top advisers, also helped push the talks toward
agreement.
</P>
<P>
No details of the agreement were disclosed, but the two parties
have resolved major differences and they were working on details
of when the pilots would return to work, an Associated Press
report said.
</P>
<P>
The pilots began their strike on August 28, seeking a 14
percent salary increase over three years, while Northwest offered
nine percent over four years.
</P>
<P>
The strike, the longest against a U.S. airline since 1989,
forced Northwest to cancel all its 1,700 daily flights and lay off
about 28,300 non-striking employees. It was estimated that the
strike has caused the airline a loss of more than 300 million
U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Air Canada and Pilots Reach Tentative Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Air Canada and its striking
pilots reached a tentative agreement Thursday night to end a
nine-day strike.
</P>
<P>
The 2,100 pilots of Canada's largest airline are expected to
vote on the proposed contract in a ratification ballot to be held
over the next three days.
</P>
<P>
"Once Air Canada pilots have ratified the agreement, the
airline will begin phasing in operations with 24 hours," the
airline said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"Service would resume to most destinations within three to four
days once aircraft are repositioned and crews flown in to operate
flights," the airline said.
</P>
<P>
The strike, which began at midnight, September 1, was centered
on pilots' wage increases. The pilots demanded a 12 percent
increase over two years while the airline agreed only to nine
percent.
</P>
<P>
Details of Thursday's tentative agreement will not be released
until the pilots are briefed, according to the Air Canada Pilots
Association.
</P>
<P>
"It has been a long road, but I am delighted to have secured a
tentative agreement," said Jean-Marc Belanger, chairman of the
association.
</P>
<P>
"It's a good deal. It's a fair deal. But perhaps even more
important for the majority of our pilots, it's a deal that holds
real improvements in our working conditions and the rules we live
by," Belanger said.

NEW YORK, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The United States increased
its high-tech exports to China by 53 percent in the first half of
1998, the American Electronics Association (AEA) said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
China, where U.S. exports of computers, semiconductors and
consumer electronics grew by 497 million U.S. dollars to 1.43
billion dollars, was a notable exception in Asian markets, AEA
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
But exports to other Asian countries fell by 3.74 billion
dollars, 12 percent down from the same period in 1997, as a result
of economic crisis, with a decline of 64 percent to Indonesia, 37
percent to South Korea, 26 percent to Thailand and 14 percent to
Japan.
</P>

<P>
BANGKOK, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The 15,000-member World
Gastroenterology Congress will hold its next convention in 2002 in
Bangkok, it was announced late Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
Judges, representing some 75 countries, voted 53:22 in favor of
Thailand over Singapore as the venue.
</P>
<P>
Held every four years, the congress will be one of the biggest
medical conventions ever to be held here and will generate
employment along with an income of 1.5 billion baht (about 375
million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The event will convene at the Bangkok International Trade and
Exhibition Center.
</P>
<P>
Medical conventions are among the most sought after in the
meetings and conventions industry owing to the high purchasing
power of participants.
</P>
<P>
Tourism Authority of Thailand chairman Jurin Laksanavisit said:
"We thank the judges of the International Gastroenterology
Association for their support. We will do everything possible to
ensure that their convention is among the best ever."
</P>
<P>
He said the decision would lift morale in the Thai tourism
industry and prove that the industry has credibility even in this
time of crisis.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of gastroenterological associations from 32
countries came to Thailand on exploratory visits before the
decision was made. The Thai government and the private sector had
spent about 18.8 million bath (450,000 dollars) on preparatory
efforts.
</P>
<P>
The last gastroenterology congress was held in Vienna earlier
this month.

SHANGHAI, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Hongqiao Airport in
Shanghai, China's largest industrial center, resumed normal
operation early this morning after a Chinese passenger plane made
an emergency landing at 23:07 hours Thursday because of a
mechanical failure.
</P>
<P>
The first plane, a CA 176 plane from Air China, landed at the

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Develop Electronic Commerce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Thailand is launching an
electronic commerce pilot project, which aims to help Thailand
strengthen its position in global trade negotiations, Deputy Prime
Minister Supachai Panitchpakdi said.
</P>
<P>
The country needed to amend existing laws and introduce new
ones in order to make e-commerce a reality, Supachai, who is also
commerce minister, was quoted by Friday's Bangkok Post newspaper
as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Ministry has developed a central website --
www.thaiecommerce.net -- which is intended to function as a
central resource with links to the home pages of other businesses.
</P>
<P>
Participation on the site will be limited to Thai businesses
with established brand names or ISO international quality
certification, because the ministry wants to create a good image
for Thai products.
</P>
<P>
The main target export markets under the project are the United
States, the European Union, Japan, the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations and other Asian countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
According to Supachai, the project is part of the government's
attempt to prepare for liberalization of e-commerce worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Supachai said there were still obstacles in Thailand to develop
e-commerce, including limited investment in information technology
infrastructure, high service fees, and the reluctance of financial
institutions to support on-line money transactions.

<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Ecuador's banana exports fell
in the first eight months of this year, because of the Asian
financial crisis, official statistics showed Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Ecuador's total banana exports dropped 18.7 percent, from 143
million boxes to 117 million boxes, compared to the same period in
1997.
</P>
<P>
But the amount of exports to the China between January and June
of 1998 dropped 78 percent, from 35.8 million U.S. dollars to 7.9
million dollars over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
In South Korea, the volume fell 99 percent, from 3.3 million
dollars to less than 42,000 dollars, and in Japan, 18 percent
less, according to the National Banana Corporation.
</P>
<P>
Ecuador sent 400,000 tons of bananas to Asia last year, 10
percent of the fruit's total exports. However, the number will
reduce to 300,000 tons by the end of 1998, which means a
50-million-dollar loss to Ecuador, it said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in Russia, Ecuador dropped 20 percent in its banana
exports.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Calls For World Bank, IMF Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan President
Chandrika Kumaratunga, who is also chairperson of the South Asian
Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC), has called for
reforms of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund
(IMF), saying they are becoming less and less effective.
</P>
<P>
Meeting delegates from South Asian countries to the Second
SAARC Trade fair here Thursday in Colombo, Kumaratunga said the
two institutions are proving less effective in responding
satisfactorily to modern economic challenges, the official Daily
News reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
She pointed out that the world has changed drastically after
World War II.
</P>
<P>
Kumaratunga said that international organizations formed 50
years ago in a bipolar world are not effective enough to grapple
with the multifarious problems facing different regions today.
</P>
<P>
They are not seriously geared to face these challenges. She
urged the international community to evolve systems within the
United Nations which will effectively respond to economic
problems.
</P>
<P>
Kumaratunga stressed that the SAARC nations should become
economically stronger in order to stand on their own feet and
harmonize their views in world trade negotiations.
</P>
<P>
She said, "There is no alternative. We must present a common
view point at the negotiating table to obtain our due. Nothing is
given free. We should not beg any longer."
</P>
<P>
She said SAARC has still not begun to formulate plans to
counter the dominance of the developed world in global trade. It
is still grappling with some problems faced by globalization. A
stronger SAARC raising one voice would hopefully redress these
problems.
</P>
<P>
The SAARC countries with 500 million consumers were until
recently trading mostly with western countries, especially their
former colonialists, ignoring the vast potential of intra-regional
trade, said she, adding that "We are now beginning to explore the
possibilities of increased trade within the SAARC region."

<HEADLINE> Hungary Backs NATO's Action Plan Over Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Hungary fully supports the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization's military action plan aimed at
settling the Kosovo crisis, Foreign Ministry spokesman Horvath
Gabor said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He said the Serb security forces should immediately end their
operations against Kosovo residents, which, he said, "have so far
brought about serious humanitarian and political consequences."
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, he said, the Kosovo armed forces should also
halt their military actions.
</P>
<P>
He said Hungary shares NATO's view that the Kosovo crisis will
escalate unless the international community takes resolute actions.
</P>
<P>
NATO's action plan which was completed on Wednesday is such a
step aimed at stemming the situation in Kosovo from worsening,
Gabor said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that Hungary favors granting the Yugoslav
province broad autonomy on the basis of maintaining the
territorial integrity of Yugoslavia and its current border lines.
</P>
<P>
NATO announced Wednesday that it could send 50,000
peace-keeping troops into Kosovo if a ceasefire was agreed upon
between the conflicting sides.
</P>
<P>
However, U.S. Navy Adm. Joseph Lopez stressed that the figure
has not been fixed yet and that a diplomatic solution is still a
first choice.
</P>
<P>
Also on Wednesday, a NATO official in Brussels said the
alliance has drafted contingency plans for a range of military
options for Kosovo, including the use of troops to enforce any
ceasefire or peace settlement but will not act without
authorization from the United Nations.

<HEADLINE> Finance Official Calls for Higher Investment Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 11 (Xinhua) -- A Finance Ministry official
has called for higher investment growth during the the later half
year to attain the goal of eight percent growth for China's
economy.
</P>
<P>
"Given the weak export and consumption demand, it is essential
that investment grow 17 percent this year to push economic growth
up to eight percent," said Wang Jiachun, an expert with the
Ministry of Finance.
</P>
<P>
Predicting a turnaround in the national economy for the second
half year, Wang said the government still needs to further
increase investment to realize an eight percent economic growth
rate.
</P>
<P>
That translates to an investment growth of approximately 20
percent for the second half year, when averaged in with the less
than 14 percent growth during the January-June period, Wang
explained.
</P>
<P>
Wang added that China cannot count on help from the export
sector to aid economic growth this year, since the financial
situation in Asia may not improve for the near future.
</P>
<P>
"The ailing Japanese economy, and the more than 100 trillion
Japanese yen in bad loans, will continue to weaken the yen for a
long time to come, and as a result the economic and financial
situation in other Asian countries may even worsen. All these
factors will exert greater pressure on China's exports," he said.
</P>
<P>
As a major contributor to the national economy, exports made up
about two percent of last year's economic growth. This figure may
diminish to zero this year, according to Wang.
</P>
<P>
Another major force driving the national economy, consumption
demand, will see no marked increase during the later half year,
which makes high investment demand growth all that more urgent,
according to Wang.

<P>
JAKARTA, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's central bank has
reiterated that Indonesia would not copy Malaysia's move last week
to impose foreign exchange controls, the Jakarta Post reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Bank Indonesia Governor Sjahril Sabirin said Indonesia had
already had an experience with capital controls in the past and
believed them to be ineffective.
</P>
<P>
"We've already had that experience before and it didn't work
well," he told reporters following a hearing with the House of
Representatives on a new government-proposed banking bill.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia introduced a capital control system in the late 1960s
and early 1970s, a move that created a black market for foreign
currency and rampant currency smuggling.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah, which had been hovering over the 13,000 level to
the U.S. dollar for months, strengthened to about 10,800 last week
before slipping back to the 12,000 level this week in the wake of
widespread demonstrations against the government.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's central bank's
net international reserves increased 919 million U.S. dollars last
week, newspapers reports said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Bank Indonesia said in a statement that the reserves increased
to 14.436 billion dollars on September 7 from the previous week's
level of 13.517 billion dollars due to loan disbursements.
</P>
<P>
The level is far above the adjusted International Monetary Fund
target of 13.72 billion dollars, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
A disbursement of 1 billion dollars in loans from the Export
Import Bank of Japan was responsible for the rise, it said, adding
that the reserves would fall again.

<P>
BEIJING, September 11 (Xinhua) -- High temperatures have
hovered over the Chinese capital for the past week, causing some
problems for Beijingers.
</P>
<P>
Some people have begun using their air conditioners again after
turning them off nearly a month ago, and buses equipped with air
conditioning are again top choice of commuters.
</P>
<P>
Bicycle riders are dripping with sweat and some people are
fainting in the scorching heat.
</P>
<P>
The temperature remained over 30 degrees Celsius all last week,
with the high reaching 31.5 degrees on September 6.
</P>
<P>
According to the Beijing Municipal Meteorological Station, high
temperatures in September were seldom recorded in the past. The
cause of unusually hot weather is believed to be the combination
of strong continental hot air pressure over Beijing and a dearth
of cooler air. Clear weather is also a factor contributing to the
high temperature in the city.
</P>
<P>
Meteorologists predicts that high temperatures will continue
for another week, with highs exceeding 30 degrees Celsius.
</P>
<P>
Cooler air is expected to arrive by late September.

<P>
MEXICO CITY, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Latin American stocks
plunged Thursday, with Brazil, Argentina, Mexico and Chile the
hardest hit.
</P>
<P>
In Brazil, the Bovespa index of the Sao Paulo exchange dropped
14.5 percent by 3:00 p.m. (1800 GMT), and finished at 4761 points,
the lowest of the year.
</P>
<P>
Mexican stocks plunged as Mexico's central bank tried to defend
the peso by selling dollars on the open market. At the close, the
main stock index had slid 9.82 percent.
</P>
<P>
Mexico's central bank reportedly sold 100 million dollars in an
effort to shore up the peso Thursday. It was the fifth such
intervention this year.
</P>
<P>
Chilean stocks fell sharply also, with the IPSA index falling
7.38 percent by mid-afternoon. The decline brought the year's
losses on Chile's main exchange to 47.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Buenos Aires Merval stock index dropped 10.43 percent in
midday trading, and closed at 301.73 points.
</P>
<P>
The turbulent stock markets made foreign investors lose
confidence in the region. Some two billion dollars have been
reportedly pulled out of Brazil since Tuesday, bringing the total
capital flight since mid-August to 20 billion dollars.

HAVANA, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Cuba said on Thursday that the
process of foreign investment in the country continues despite
intensified United States blockade
</P>
<P>
Foreign Investment and Economic Collaboration Minister Ibrahim
Ferradaz told the local press that 10 agreements of promotion
and protection of foreign investments are being negotiated, while
33 others signed with 34 countries are already in force.
</P>
<P>
He said that the authorities are studying a new legislation for
investments in real estate, where eight foreign firms are already
operating or in the process of doing it, while 10 other new
projects are being discussed. .
</P>
<P>
He noted that the purpose of the anti-Cuban Helms-Burton Law
promoted by the U.S. to tighten the economic blockade on the
island has not been attained as there are now more than 340
economic associations with foreign capital in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
However, Ferradaz did not dismiss the effects of that U.S.
legislation, because, he said, it cannot be estimated how many
more associations there would be if there were no pressures

<TEXT>
<P>
MONTEVIDEO, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Trade between Uruguay and
Mercosur member countries totaled about 1.56 billion U.S. dollars
in the first half of this year, a 12.6 percent increase over the
same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The Uruguay's central bank said the Southern Common Market
(Mercosur) has become Uruguay's biggest trading partner, surpassing
the United States and the European Union countries.
</P>
<P>
The exports to Argentina, Brazil and Paraguay, the three other
Mercosur member countries, amounted to 800 million dollars out of
Uruguay's total 1.4 billion dollars of exports in the first six
months, while its imports were 763 million dollars from the three
countries.
</P>
<P>
Affected by the Asian financial crisis, Uruguay's exports to
the region fell 25.5 percent in January-June. To overcome the
adverse effect, Uruguay has expanded its trade with the Mercosur
to cut down its trade deficit.
</P>
<P>
Mercosur, established in 1991, aims at achieving the economic
integration of member states through a free flow of goods and
services between them, the establishment of a common external
tariff, the adoption of common commercial policy and the
coordination of macroeconomic and sectoral policies.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Regrets EU Flight Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The Yugoslavian government
Thursday expressed regret at the European Union's (EU) ban on
flights by Yugoslav airlines to EU airports, the official news
agency Tanjug reported.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslav government claimed the ban was "illegal and one-sided"
and said it was yet another discriminatory policy imposed by the
EU on Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The flight ban would not help settle the Kosovo crisis, but
would only serve to encourage separatist and terrorist forces,
Tanjug said.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav government would refrain from reciprocating,
but would honor accords with EU countries and civil regulations on
air transportation, to allow EU airlines into Yugoslavia, Tanjug
reported.
</P>
<P>
The government vowed to take all necessary steps to protect the
interest of Yugoslav air transport companies.
</P>
<P>
Most EU members banned Yugoslav airline flights to their
airports after the EU foreign ministers' decision in Salzburg,
Austria, last week to impose sanctions on Yugoslavia for its
crackdown on ethnic Albanian separatists in the province of
Kosovo.

<P>
HAVANA, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The Cuban government Thursday
said it would refuse any humanitarian aid from the United States
government despite a drought in the east of the country.
</P>
<P>
The announcement came after the United Nations requested 20.5
million U.S. dollars in food aid for 615,000 Cubans affected by
drought, which the U.S. State Department is considering.
</P>
<P>
Cuban Foreign Ministry spokesman Alejandro Gonzalez said that
the U.N. World Food Program had announced a 20-million dollar aid
package after five provinces in the eastern part of the island
were badly hit by drought.
</P>
<P>
He said humanitarian aid from the U.S. government would be
humiliating, hypocritical and unacceptable after an economic,
trade and financial blockade against Cuba for the past 40 years.
</P>
<P>
Cuba would accept aid from U.S. non-governmental organizations
and individuals to help overcome the situation, he said.
</P>

While firmly refusing the U.S. aid, Gonzalez expressed his

<HEADLINE> Smoke Trees in Beijing Blaze Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Visitors to Beijing can
expect to see beautiful " red leaves" at the Fragrant Hill Park
this year thanks to a campaign against seasonal pests in the past
year, "China Daily" reported today.
</P>
<P>
The park attracts domestic and overseas visitors each late
autumn with its charming blazing red leaves on the smoke trees
grown on the 79 ha of hilly lands. Seen from a distance, the hill
looks like it is shrouded by red clouds.
</P>
<P>
But last year, an invasion of Mushi, a mosquito-like insect
with an appetite for smoke tree leaves, left the forest withered,
its beauty gone. Mushi suck the sap from the leaves, shrivelling
them and leaving ugly spots instead of rich greens and reds. The
number of complaints from Fragrant Hills visitors grew.
</P>
<P>
To save the trees, the Beijing Garden Administration and
Fragrant Hills Park (BGAFHP) organized its staff members to kill the
insects. Two roads were built among smoke trees to allow workers
to reach the trees and spray insecticide.
</P>
<P>
Jie Jun, an official with the BGAFHP, attributed the success
of the campaign to a system of sampling 10 fields' pest
populations over the entire smoke tree forest.
</P>
<P>
"Putting of nutritional supplement bars at the roots of 450
comparatively weak smoke trees not only saved them but also ensured
their healthy growth."
</P>
<P>
"This year, we also began to regularly trim off twigs to
increase the sunshine among trees," he said.

HELSINKI, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Visiting French Prime
Minister Lionel Jospin and his Finnish counterpart Paavo Lipponen
Thursday called for a quick solution to Russia's political and
economic crises.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a joint press conference after their talks, the
Finnish prime minister reaffirmed Finland's readiness to provide
emergency food aid to Russia and called for a quick return to
normality of its situation.
</P>
<P>
Jospin said he hoped that Russia would have a government and
prime minister supported by the nation to deal with the current
crises.
</P>
<P>
France was also ready to give food aid to Russia if it asked
for, Jospin added.
</P>
<P>
During their talks, the two prime ministers also discussed
problems in the European Union, cooperation between the EU and
the Baltic region and ways to strengthen cooperation on
telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari also met Jospin
to discuss the Russian situation.
</P>
<P>
Ahtisaari reportedly mentioned again the Finnish proposal which
called for a summit meeting of the EU, Russia and the United
States in the second half of next year when Finland will be the
rotating EU president.
</P>
<P>
The French prime minister did not comment on the proposal. He
noted Russia had encountered more problems than other eastern
European countries on its transition from planned economy to
market economy.

<HEADLINE> Head of Italian Anti-State Group Arrested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Former head of the secret P2
Masonic lodge Licio Gelli was arrested Thursday after four months
on the run, Italian Interior Minister Giorgio Napolitano said.
</P>
<P>
Gelli, known as "the puppet master", was the most prominent
among 16 members of the P2 Masonic lodge who went on trial in
October 1992 on charges of espionage and conspiracy against the
state.
</P>
<P>
The defendants were acquitted after a 17-month trial, but Gelli
was sentenced in April 1994 to 12 years in prison on lesser
charges of attempting to pervert the course of justice, slandering
magistrates and procuring confidential documents.
</P>
<P>
He absconded in May this year while living under police
surveillance at home in his villa in Tuscany.
</P>
<P>
The 79-year-old Gelli, wearing a false beard and carrying
phoney Italian identity papers, was arrested in Cannes on the
French Riviera in a joint operation by Italian and French police.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference in Rome, Prime Minister Romano Prodi
hailed the arrest as "very important for Italy."
</P>
<P>
Gelli will be tried in France for using fake identification
card, after which he will be extradited to Italy. Sources in Italy
said Gelli would go to court in Rome in five days following his
extradition.
</P>
<P>
Gelli's sentence had been reduced to eight years on appeal but
he managed to avoid serving any time in prison by virtue of a
further reduction in his sentence.
</P>
<P>
Just before Gelli disappeared, the court of appeal issued a
warrant for Gelli's arrest on charge of fraudulent bankruptcy in
the collapse in 1982 of the Banco Ambrosiano.
</P>
<P>
Gelli joined Fascist Party when he was young. In 1963, he
joined the lodge and established the secret P2 Masonic, which
especially attracts powerful governmental executives as members to
help the lodge's criminal activities.

<HEADLINE> Austria Welcomes Nomination of Primakov </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Austria on Thursday welcomed
the nomination of Yevgeny Primakov as prime minister of Russia
as a move to return stability to the economically stricken country.
</P>
<P>
"Austria welcomes every step that can lead Russia to an early
realization of stability," Austrian Chancellor Viktor Klima said.
</P>
<P>
Russian President Boris Yeltsin nominated Acting
Foreign Minister Primakov for the premiership after the lower
house of parliament, the State Duma, twice rejected his first
choice, Acting Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin.
</P>
<P>
Klima said it was of upmost importance for Russia to establish
a government capable of acting and from this point of view,
Yeltsin's compromise was creditable.
</P>
<P>
He added that as soon as Russia had a government, a European
Union delegation would go to Moscow for talks on economic aid.
</P>
<P>
The delegation would consist of the EU foreign ministers of
Austria, Britain and Germany and Austrian Finance Minister and
chairman of the EU committee of finance ministers Rudolf
Edlinger. Austria now holds the rotating EU presidency.
</P>
<P>
Klima said Russia's troubles went beyond an economic crisis to
become a constitutional crisis and the state must find "a reform
road that can accompany social harmony".
</P>
<P>
Austrian Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schoessel also welcomed the
nomination of Primakov, noting that Primakov, for years, had
"built Russia's image" in the world and remained "a stable
element" in Russian policies.
</P>
<P>
Schoessel, also vice chancellor of Austria, stressed that
Russia needed a continuous and stable policy and Vienna would
support a Russian government that "continues to uphold democracy
and adheres to the reform path".

<P>
TIANJIN, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Tianjin, the largest
industrial port city in north China, has accelerated the pace of
investing abroad and attracting overseas funds in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Statistics through the end of last year show that Tianjin
enterprises had established 290 firms in Brazil, Singapore,
Germany and Mongolia, with total investments approaching 100
million US dollars. Forty of the firms are engaged in production
and an additional 130 operate in the trade sector. Another ten
firms will be established in various parts of the world during
1998, according to Pi Qiansheng, director of the Municipal
Economic and Trade Commission.
</P>
<P>
The Tianjin Economic Development Zone will join four Egyptian
companies and banks in a cooperative project to build an
experimental industrial zone at the southern tip of the Suez
Canal. The zone will cover 19.4 sq.km. and will be completed at a
cost of 70 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Cooperative ventures with foreign firms have proved highly
successful. For example, the Tianjin Tractor Plant invested one
million US dollars in 1995 to construct an assembly line in
Brazil. The company's tractors have hit the market in Brazil and
the plant plans to upgrade technologically to suit local
demand.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime Tianjin has invited overseas investors to
participate in high-tech development projects, restructuring of
state-owned firms and forming joint ventures in travel services
and consulting businesses.
</P>
<P>
According to Pi, the city is currently engaged in negotiations
on 40 foreign-funded projects which will involve estimated
investments of 1.5 billion US dollars.

<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Switzerland signed historic
accords with Italy on justice, immigration and police cooperation
here Thursday, moving closer to the Schengen system of
cross-border cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Swiss Justice Minister Arnold Koller, who signed the three
accords, noted that they were the first that his country had
stipulated with a neighbor. The accords mark the start of a shift
away from centuries of Swiss neutrality in which alliances were
shunned.
</P>
<P>
Koller said he viewed the agreements as "pilot treaties"in the
Alpine nation's new foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
Switzerland, which is not a member of the Schengen Accord, is
negotiating similar agreements with its other neighbors: France,
Germany and Austria.
</P>
<P>
Representing Italy were Interior Minister Giorgio Napolitano,
Justice Minister Giovanni Maria Flick and Foreign Minister Lamberto
Dini.
</P>
<P>
Napolitano said the immigration accord aimed to "regulate
efforts to combat illegal immigration and the criminal trafficking
of people that is often associated with it".
</P>
<P>
The justice accord provides for better collaboration between
the two countries' judiciaries, especially regarding requests for
evidence located in one country from prosecutors in the other.
</P>
<P>
The third accord established a framework for police cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Initially five European Union members signed an agreement in
the Luxembourg hamlet of Schengen in 1985, aiming to abolish all
border checks on goods and people by 1990. But because of a "lack
of preparation", the Schengen accord had not taken effect until
March 26, 1995.
</P>
<P>
Under the accord, travellers from EU countries can cross the
borders of any of the signatories without visas.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientists Cultivate Greenery on Sea Ooze </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Common soil plants like
flowers, grass and bushes have been successfully grown on ooze
dredge out of the sea bottom at a 25,000-sq-m experimental garden
in an economic development zone in this North China port city.
</P>
<P>
It is said to be the world's first piece of greenery produced
on saline soil.
</P>
<P>
In the early 1990s, local scientists started to experiment with
a technique to clean salt from sea ooze, using thin plastic tubes.
</P>
<P>
The technique will be used to extend the area of greenery to
two million sq m of saline soil in the zone, which is planned to
cover 33 sq km eventually.
</P>
<P>
Local people used to cover saline soil with cultivated soil in
an effort to plant trees. This kind of mixture, however, became
saline itself within two years.
</P>
<P>
With the new technique, local people have planted trees on
dredged sea ooze covering 20,000 sq m along the coastline, which
is mixed with coal ash and alkaline residue. So far, 90 percent of
the trees have survived, and the quality of soil is improving.

<HEADLINE> Central China Province Focuses on Counter-Flood Farming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Hubei Province, a grain
producer on China's Yangtze River, is considering its agricultural
production less likely to be severely hurt by the river's flood
season, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
"The persistent floods this summer have affected more than 2.54
million ha. of cultivated fields, and destroyed 4.86 million tons
of grain," Duan Wenjie, a provincial agricultural official.
</P>
<P>
A campaign has been launched to minimize agricultural losses in
flood-stricken area, Duan said.
</P>
<P>
By August 20, farmers had pumped water from 233,300 ha. of
fields, and planted 660,600 hectares of late rice and 218,000
ha. of autumn corn and vegetables in "reclaimed fields".
</P>
<P>
According to State Council directions, Hubei will have to
relocate thousands of people living on fields to a "safety belt",
but the farmland there could be still used if approached
scientifically, the official noted.
</P>
<P>
For example, Yanji Town in Ezhou City gave up planting rice
this year on its four ha of fields reclaimed from the river
bank. And the local farmers planted vegetable instead.

<HEADLINE> Campaign Launched to Protect Creditor's Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Courts in South China's
Guangdong Province are taking tougher actions to enforce civil
court orders.
</P>
<P>
The campaign is targeting so-called debt repudiators, people
and enterprises refusing to pay overdue court-ordered debts
despite having the economic ability to do so.
</P>
<P>
"There is absolutely no way for them to escape responsibility
for the debts," said Lu Botao, director of the Guangdong
Provincial Higher People's Court.
</P>
<P>
Initially, names of the repudiators are being published in the
local press in an attempt to bring the problem to the public's
attention.
</P>
<P>
In Foshan, the Intermediate People's Court Publicizes the list
on a large LED (Light-emitting display) bulletin board in downtown
that was once used for commercial advertisements.
</P>
<P>
If the repudiators continue to ignore the court, executors from
the courts may enforce compliance.
</P>
<P>
Local Media have hailed the courts' determination and have
given support to the campaign by publicizing debtors' lists during
the past two months. They described the campaign as "a campaign to
defend the law's honor and to protect legal rights of creditors."
</P>
<P>
Additional support came from the Supreme People's Court which
issued a document last Monday concerning how to deal with the
resistance to execution of laws.
</P>
<P>
"It empowers the local courts with greater authority and
provides practical measures for defending the Law's honor," said
Lu.
</P>
<P>
The tough actions have proven effective in Guangzhou, and
Zhanjiang, Shenzhen, Dongguan and Foshan cities in Guangdong.

WARSAW, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Polish President Aleksander
Kwasniewski said here Thursday that he hoped Russian President
Boris Yeltsin's new nominee for the premiership, Yevgeny Primakov,
would be approved by the State Duma.
</P>
<P>
At a joint press conference with visiting Peruvian President
Alberto Fujimori, Kwasniewski said he knew Primakov very well.
</P>
<P>
"Primakov is a realistic and responsible man and has the
capability to deal with the political crisis in Russia and form a
government capable of having State institutions to perform its
duties," he added.
</P>
<P>
Fujimori, who is on a four-day visit, is the first Peruvian
president to visit Poland since the two countries established

The Polish president said once Russia's political situation was
stable, Poland would be expected to assist Russia in reforming its
economic structure.
</P>
<P>
Primakov, Russia's Acting Foreign Minister, was nominated by
Yeltsin Thursday after his first choice Viktor Chernomyrdin was
rejected twice by the Duma and asked not to be nominated for a

<P>
WASHINGTON, September 10 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill
Clinton apologized to members of his cabinet in a meeting at the
White House on Thursday, urging them to focus on the daily
business of running the country.
</P>
<P>
"It was an extraordinary meeting. It was emotional," Energy
Secretary Bill Richardson told reporters after the meeting. "The
president had a strong message for all us and that was that we
should press ahead with the business of the country."
</P>
<P>
Richardson said, "I support him. He was hurting. He apologized
and we got to move on."
</P>
<P>
Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater, borrowing from the book
of Galatians, said he told Clinton that "in due season we shall
reap if we do not lose heart."
</P>
<P>
"This is a president who has not lost heart," Slater said.
"This is a Cabinet... that has not lost heart. And that will carry
us through this."
</P>
<P>
Clinton spoke to Senate Democrats earlier in the day, following
a meeting on Wednesday with top Democrats from the House of
Representatives, as he continued his efforts to make amends for
having an affair with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky
and misleading the American people about it.
</P>

"A lot of healing was done tonight. I think tonight was good; I
think it helped all of us," said Federal Emergency Management
Agency Director James Lee Witt, a longtime friend of Clinton's and
fellow Arkansan.

<HEADLINE> Delphi Values Aisa-Pacific Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Delphi Automotive Systems
plans to attach greater importance to the Asia-Pacific market in
the wake of its recently announced spin-off from General Motors
(GM) Corporation.
</P>
<P>
Delphi will operate as an independent automobile parts and
components supplier to automakers around the world, rather than
focusing mainly GM's traditional North American market.
</P>
<P>
William Ebbert, president of Delphi's Asia-Pacific Branch, said
here Thursday that the company's sales volume to automakers other
than GM will climb from 38 percent to 50 percent by the year 2002.
</P>
<P>
Earlier last month, GM and Delphi, a subsidiary of the parent
company, jointly announced that the latter will become a fully
independent publicly traded company in 1999. Delphi is expected to
offer 15-20 percent of its common stock in an initial public
offering during the first quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
Ebbert said that Delphi's sales volume in Asia-Pacific region
will grow to 3.4 billion U.S. dollar, or double the 1997
figure. The growth is expected to come largely from sales to other
automakers than GM joint venture plants in the region.
</P>
<P>
Delphi's market share for China will hover between 25-27
percent by the year 2002, up substantially from this year's 20
percent.
</P>
<P>
Marcus Chao, president of Delphi's China Operations, pointed
out that the spin-off from GM will be quite likely to mean that
Delphi will not only be a major supplier of automobile parts and
components for GM's Shanghai joint venture which will turn out its
first vehicles later this year, but will also market products to
all major automobile manufacturers in China, including
Shanghai-Volkswagen, the First Automotive Works, FAW-Volkswagen
and Dongfeng-Citreon.
</P>
<P>
Delphi has invested some 400,000 million U.S. dollars on 15
joint ventures in China. Chao said that Delphi plans to increase
its presence in China, and noted that the country's industrial
policies favor the development of parts and components, rather
than the introduction of new models of automobiles.

<HEADLINE> Wenger in Dark over Carlton Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger
said that he was shocked by the news that club is having talks
with media group Carlton Communications.
</P>
<P>
The Highbury board says discussions concern a "range of ways
in which the two companies might work together".
</P>
<P>
Carlton is also talking to Aston Villa - but it is not known
if any takeovers are on the agenda.
</P>
<P>
The moves comes after Manchester United accepted a 623m bid
from another broadcaster, BSkyB.
</P>
<P>
Wenger said none of the club's directors had contacted him
about the negotiations with Carlton.
</P>
<P>
The Frenchman, who earlier this week voiced his concerns about
giant media corporations taking over the Premiership's top clubs,
said "I can understand the worries of the fans.
</P>
<P>
"Their concern is that the people who own their club should
also love it. They don't want it to just become a business."
</P>
<P>
The former Monaco coach said: "It is the history of football
in England that club owners are in the game for things other than
business reasons, but the game is changing all the time."
</P>
<P>
Wenger, who last season guided Arsenal to their first Double
since 1971, said it would also be very difficult for media firms
to be objective in their dealings with the club they owned.
</P>
<P>
He said there had to be "separation" between the club and the
company that owned it but he gave a sign of hope from France.
</P>
<P>
The television company Canal Plus already owns Paris St
Germain but Wenger said: "When they cover the team's matches they
are more critical of them than any other team."

JAKARTA, September 11 (Xinhua) -- A total of 11 people were
killed and 38 others injured in two public buses which collided in
Indramayu district, 240 kilometers east of Jakarta, on Wednesday
night, national newspapers reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The collision occurred after the "Garuda Mas" which was coming
from Jakarta, attempted to overtake another vehicle, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
As the "Garuda Mas" driver steered the bus to the right, he
suddenly saw some of the bridge's pillars in front of him. And to
avoid them, he swerved into the lane reserved for vehicles going
in opposite direction.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the public bus "Ismo" was approaching from
the other direction and the inevitable happened: the two buses ran
into each other head on.
</P>
<P>
The impact pushed the "Ismo" off the bridge and into the river,
followed by the "Garuda Mas" which fell on "Ismo"'s top, the
report said.

<HEADLINE> Tyson Faces Tax Lien on His Mansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Mike Tyson faces 6.3
million U.S. dollars tax lien on his 61-room mansion in
Connecticut. The Internal Revenue Service placed the lien on the
Farmington estate last month.
</P>
<P>
Tyson signed a 33 million dollars agreement with Showtime last
month, the contract requires him to pay off the lien. Tyson's
payment from Showtime depend on the outcome of a September 19
hearing before boxing regulators in Nevada, where he is trying to
get his license back. He lost it last year and was fined 3
million dollars for biting Evander Holyfield's ears in a title
fight.
</P>
<P>
Under the Showtime contract, the 32-year-old Tyson must pay
off several debts, including taxes on his 1996 income as soon as
possible.
</P>
<P>
Tyson also owes the town of Farmington nearly 25,000 dollars
in property taxes. The mansion has been for sale for more than a
year with a 22 million price tag. Tyson's former agent Rory
Holloway bought the estate for the former heavyweight champion
for 2.7 million in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The town estimates the house - which has 24 full bathrooms, an
indoor swimming pool, a racquetball court, a basketball court and
a shooting range - is worth only about 4.3 million.
</P>
<P>
In addition to trying to get his boxing license back, Tyson
faces an October 2 hearing in Montgomery County on charges he
assaulted two men after a fender-bender involving a car driven by
his wife. The outcome of that case could affect his probation in
Indiana, where he spent three years in prison for rape.

<HEADLINE> Moya Advances to U.S. Open Semis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 10 (Xinhua) -- French Open champion Carlos
Moya of Spain needed just 90 minutes to beat Sweden's Magnus
Larsson 6-4, 6-3, 6-3 and advanced to the semifinals of the U.S.
Open tennis championships here today.
</P>
<P>
Moya faced just one break point the entire match and
controlled the battle from both the baseline and the net as he
became the first Spanish man to advance to the Open semifinals in
23 years.
</P>
<P>
He committed only 15 unforced errors and won 25-of-28 points
at the net. The 10th seed will meet the winner of tonight's
quarterfinal between unseeded players Mark Philippoussis of
Australia and Thomas Johansson of Sweden.
</P>
<P>
The 22-year-old Moya, last year's Australian Open runner-up,
was a little surprised that he won so easily.
</P>
<P>
"I was a little bit surprised, but I knew he had some problems
with his back, and these windy conditions was better for me," he
said. "I just tried to do my best. It was easier than I expected,
I have to say that."
</P>
<P>
In contrast, the big Swede struggled throughout the match with
41 unforced errors and seemed uncomfortable in the cold, windy
conditions.
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what happened out there," Larsson said. "He was
playing too good in these conditions. I had real problems with
the wind, as I usually have."
</P>
<P>
Moya closed out the match with his only ace of the day. He
advanced to the quarterfinals Monday night with a straight-set
victory over countryman Alex Corretja, but that is not indicative
of the hard road the Spaniard has had to travel.
</P>
<P>
Moya came back form two sets down and survived three match
points to take out American Michael Chang in the second round and
survived a fifth-set tiebreak with American Jan-Michael Gambill
in the third round.
</P>
<P>
Johansson and Philippoussis, who also have never faced each
other, both will be playing in their first U.S. Open
quarterfinal.

<HEADLINE> NBA Cancels Game for First Time Due to Labor Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The NBA lockout has caused
the first cancellation in league history as the league announced
today that a preseason game between the Miami Heat and Israeli
champion Maccabi Elite Tel Aviv scheduled for October 12 in Tel
Aviv, Israel will not be played due to the lack of progress in
reaching a new collective bargaining agreement.
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, there has been no progress in negotiations
with the Players Association," said NBA deputy commissioner Russ
Granik. "Since the lockout is still in effect, we are now forced
to start canceling events. We are disappointed that our labor
dispute has resulted in the cancellation of what could have been
an exciting international competition."
</P>
<P>
The game will be rescheduled for October 1999. The NBA is the
only major pro sports league that has not lost any regular season
games to a work stoppage.
</P>
<P>
The sides currently awaiting a grievance ruling from
arbitrator John Feerick. The NBA Players Association filed a
salary grievance hours before the owners imposed a lockout in
July 1.
</P>
<P>
The union claims NBA players have guaranteed contracts which
should allow them to be paid during the lockout. The NBA contends
its actions are entirely legal during a work stoppage.
</P>
<P>
The final briefs for the grievance hearing are due Wednesday,
and Feerick has 30 days after that to render a decision. Although
he is expected to rule before that, the start of the 1998-9
season is in serious jeopardy.

<HEADLINE> First Six Hall of Fame Players Named </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The first six players which
will be put into the new English Premier League Hall of Fame were
named on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The six players are Peter Schmeichel, Eric Cantona, Alan
Shearer, Les Ferdinand, Gianfranco Zola and Dennis Bergkamp.
</P>
<P>
The players were selected for their overall performance in
each of the first six seasons of the league, which began in the
1992-93 season.
</P>
<P>
Sir Geoff Hurst, the chairman of the 19-strong panel of
experts who selected the players said at the Hall of Fame's
launch: "One thing we looked for was excitement which got us up
out of our seats."
</P>
<P>
Questioned about the fact that only two English players were
selected, Shearer and Ferdinand, Sir Geoff said: "I don't think
we have produced enough top class English players recently, but
players like Michael Owen and Rio Ferdinand might be included if
you turn the clock forward six years."
</P>
<P>
The next six players will be inducted after a vote by fans but
the date of the next induction has not yet been fixed. The Hall
of Fame will open in London next spring.
</P>
<P>
The players were elected for their performances in the
following seasons:
</P>
<P>
1992-93 Peter Scheimchel (Manchester United, Denmark)
</P>
<P>
1993-94 Eric Cantona (Manchester United, France)

<HEADLINE> Dow Cut by 249 Points </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The Dow industrials fell as
much as 345 points Thursday as investors showed their anxiety
about the crises in Washington and the global economy.
</P>
<P>
Bargain hunters provided a late bounce. The Dow Jones
industrial average dropped 249.48 points to close at 7,615.54,
which is more than 1,700 points, or 18.4 percent, below the July
17 record of 9,337.97.
</P>
<P>
The drop, combined with Wednesday's 155-point loss, more than
wiped out the record 380 points that the Dow gained Tuesday amid
hopes the Federal Reserve may intervene in the battle against
economic distress spreading around the world.
</P>
<P>
It was the fifth time in just 10 sessions that the Dow has cut
more than 300 points in a day, including the 512-plunge on August
31.
</P>
<P>
In Russia, the ruble and stock market rebounded as a political
crisis neared resolution after President Boris Yeltsin decided to
nominate a compromise candidate for prime minister who is expected
to be approved in parliament.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indexes also tumbled Thursday, joining in yet
another global selloff in Brazil and Europe.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 fell 26.01 to 980.19, and the
technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index fell 39.22 to 1,585.33.
</P>
<P>
Decliners outpaced advancers by a 3-to-1 margin on the New York
Stock Exchange, where volume came to a blistering 875.73 million
shares, rising sharply from Wednesday's tally of 696.94 million.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE composite index fell 12.80 to 487.77, and the American
Stock Exchange composite index fell 7.21 to 606.23.
</P>
<P>
The worldwide rush out of stocks helped push up the market for
U.S. Treasury bonds. The bond rally brought the yield on 30-year
Treasury bills to another all-time low of 5.20 percent.

economic decline. He said right now Romania should speed up the
reform and the privatization process.

UNITED NATIONS, September 10 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan Thursday called on Cambodian leaders to resolve their

</P>

<HEADLINE> U.S. Positive on Nomination of Primakov as Russian PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The United States voiced
cautious optimism on Thursday over the nomination of Yevgeny
Primakov, the acting foreign minister, to become Russia's prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
The White House responded positively to President Boris
Yeltsin's nomination earlier on Thursday after the lower house of
parliament, the State Duma, twice rejected his first choice,
Viktor Chernomyrdin.
</P>
<P>
"If ratified by the Duma we would expect to have a good and
close working relationship with Prime Minister Primakov," White
House spokesman Mike McCurry told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"Obviously the United States knows and respects Foreign
Minister Primakov. We've worked closely with him," he said.
</P>
<P>
Also on Thursday, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
had a "very warm and friendly discussion" by phone, said State
Department spokesman James Rubin at a regular briefing.
</P>
<P>
"She (Albright) indicated she hadn't thought she would be
calling him to congratulate him on being named for such a post
short of being confirmed for such a post," Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
Albright and Primakov indicated "They intended to continue to
work as closely as possible together in the future and that they
would be seeing each other in New York at the General Assembly,"
the spokesman told reporters.
</P>
<P>
But he stressed, "Many questions remain to be answered before
we or the Russians themselves have a clear sense of where that
country is heading. Our views will depend on whether they will
keep Russia on the course of reform."
</P>
<P>
As foreign minister, Primakov, 68, was widely seen by the West
as a nationalist, working to restore some of the international
status Moscow lost after the collapse of the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
He has been criticized in the West for taking a less liberal
line on foreign relations, showing support for Iraq and other
regimes at odds with the West.
</P>
<P>
Primakov, a former Soviet foreign policy expert, is seen as a
technocrat, not ideologically linked to any political faction.
</P>
<P>
Opposition parties in Russia's parliament have voiced their
support for Primakov and his nomination is expected to be
confirmed as early as Friday, analysts say.

BUCHAREST, September 10 (Xinhua) -- Chief of the Hungarian
Army's General Staff Gen. Col. Ferenc Vegh Thursday ended his
two-day work visit in Romania, after making all necessary
preparations, together with his Romanian counterpart, for the
establishment of the joint Romanian-Hungarian battalion.

"The meeting further strengthened the military relations
between the two countries, and we have established again to

According to Ferenc Vegh, this year the two chiefs would meet

The two neighboring countries decided to make up the joint
battalion when their defense ministers met in the Hungarian city

soldiers -- 500 Romanians and 500 Hungarians. It will carry out
missions of peacekeeping and humanitarian aid in Europe.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council Thursday issued a presidential statement, condemning the
"heinous acts" of killing Iranian diplomats in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Hans Dahlgren, president of the 15-member Security Council,
said in a statement that "members of the Security Council condemn
these heinous acts and violations of international law."
</P>
<P>
The Security Council called for "an urgent investigation into
these crimes, so that perpetrators can be brought to justice," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council extended its welcome to on-going plans for
joint fact-finding missions which involve representatives from
Iran, Pakistan and the United Nations, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council called on the Taliban, the militant
Islamic Movement that controls most of Afghanistan, to cooperate
fully in ensuring the release and security of remaining diplomats
and other Iranian nationals missing in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council also expressed concern over renewed
tension in the region and reiterated the need for the Afghanistan
conflict to be settled in direct negotiations between Afghan
factions, according to the statement.
</P>
<P>
"The Security Council called on all concerned to exercise
maximum restraint in this situation," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council president told reporters that he had
received a phone call from the Iranian Foreign Ministry and a
letter from the Iranian U.N. Mission on the killing of Iranian
diplomats in the neighboring Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Iranian President Mohammad Khatami warned Wednesday that his
country would act "in whichever way we see fit" to resolve the
dispute with the Taliban faction.
</P>
<P>
Iran has maintained the buildup of some 70,000 troops and large
stock of military equipment in its border with Afghanistan.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Choice of Primakov, Major Concession </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 10 (Xinhua) -- By nominating Yevgeny Primakov
as prime minister, Russian President Boris Yeltsin made a major
concession under strong pressure from the opposition-dominated
State Duma.
</P>
<P>
The decision, announced Thursday, came after two days of
calculation following the rejection of the original nominee,
Viktor Chernomyrdin, in the Duma in the second balloting Monday.
</P>
<P>
The latest round of political standoff between Yeltsin and the
opposition erupted on August 23, when Yeltsin abruptly fired the
five-month-old cabinet of Sergei Kiriyenko and named Chernomyrdin
as premier the next day.
</P>
<P>
The second rejection of Chernomyrdin in the State Duma left
Yeltsin three alternatives. The first choice was to stick to
Chernomyrdin and brace for continued political stalemate with the
State Duma.
</P>
<P>
Soon after the second voting, the four major opposition
factions, the Communists, the People's Power, the Agrarians and
Yabloko, which command 254 of the 450 seats in the State Duma,
said they would continue to shoot down the candidacy if
Chernomyrdin was nominated for a third time, which means
Chernomyrdin stands no chance of getting confirmed.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, however, could still appoint Chernomyrdin by decree
and dissolve the State Duma and call early parliamentary
elections.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Yeltsin was also well aware that an
impeachment commission in the lower house of parliament was
considering the timetable of the impeachment process.
</P>
<P>
The opposition left had already indicated that the State Duma
would only consider Chernomyrdin's candidacy after a resolution
was reached on impeachment procedures against the president.

When the very existence of the State Duma is at stake, most
deputies would vote for the impeachment procedures. And once the
procedures start, the president would be no longer able to
dissolve the lower chamber.
</P>
<P>
The second option, to name Communist deputy Yury Maslyukov, a
former Soviet vice-premier, was no more enviable, because that
would be tantamount to "a government of popular trust" as proposed
by the Communists.
</P>
<P>
A government headed by Maslyukov would pit Yeltsin against both
the cabinet and an opposition-dominated State Duma, a scenario
acceptable to Yeltsin under no circumstances.
</P>
<P>
That left Yeltsin with the third choice -- to nominate Moscow
Mayor Yuri Luzhkov or Acting Foreign Minister Primakov, an
independent.
</P>
<P>
Primakov is seen as the best choice under current conditions
when Russia is riddled with political, economic and social crises.
</P>
<P>
Gennady Seleznyov, speaker of the State Duma, and leaders of
most opposition factions have reacted positively to the Primakov
nomination, which makes it very likely that the career diplomat
will get confirmed in a single balloting.
</P>
<P>
However, observers say, that does not mean an end to the
stalemate between Yeltsin and the State Duma, as new haggling will
emerge in appointment of cabinet members and political and
economic policies.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Welcomes Nomination of Primakov as Russian PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 10 (Xinhua) -- The United States voiced
cautious optimism on Thursday over the nomination of Yevgeny
Primakov, the acting foreign minister, to become Russia's prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
The White House responded positively to Russian President
Boris Yeltsin's nomination earlier on Thursday after the lower
house of parliament, the State Duma, twice rejected his first
choice, Viktor Chernomyrdin.
</P>
<P>
"If ratified by the Duma we would expect to have a good and
close working relationship with Prime Minister Primakov," White
House spokesman Mike McCurry told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"Obviously the United States knows and respects Foreign
Minister Primakov. We've worked closely with him," he said.
