<P>
Bangladesh in response to a request from the United Nations has
earlier committed to send troops to restore peace there. A total
of 780 army personnel, including four Staff Officers, have been
selected for the U.N. Assistance Mission in Sierra Leone operation.
</P>
<P>
The first contingent of 150 persons including officers was
carried by a U.N.-chartered aircraft. The rest will go within next
few days as per flight schedule, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh is among the first few countries that have been
sending troops to U.N. peacekeeping missions around the world, and
at the moment about 1,200 Bangladesh troops are stationed in eight
troubled spots.
</P>
<P>
About a dozen Bangladeshi army officers are already in that
troubled West African country as observers for the last nine
months, none of whom were taken hostage, the sources added.

<HEADLINE> China Temple Opened in Lumbini, Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The opening ceremony was inaugurated by Ismail Aymat, State
Councilor of the People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
Ismail said that the temple was built in the original style of
the Chinese Buddhist pagoda, and will further strengthen the good
relations between the two neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
"This temple is another monument of the friendship between
China and Nepal," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The temple will also help to facilitate world peace and
promote understandings among countries," he added.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the occasion, Nepali Prime Minister Girija Koirala
said the construction of the China temple and the statue of Lord
Buddha is a friendly gesture and manifestation of the goodwill of
the Chinese people to the Nepalese people.
</P>
<P>
"This gift will leave a never-to-be forgotten imprint on the
memory of the Nepalese people," he said.
</P>
<P>
The construction of China temple began in 1996 and covers an
area of nearly 3000 square meters. The six meter high Buddha at
the temple is said to be the tallest in Lumbini Complex.
</P>
<P>
A temple was already built by the government of Myanmar at the
25,600-square-meter complex, which was built under the initiation
of the United Nations Development Program to promote the
protection of world cultural heritages.
</P>
<P>
Temples and monasteries are also being constructed by Sri Lanka,
South Korea, Japan, Thailand, Vietnam, France, Germany and some
other countries.

<HEADLINE> Turkey to Expand Cooperation with Iran: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 28 (Xinhua) -- A senior Turkish trade official said
here Sunday that Ankara is to open a bright horizon for relations
with Tehran by removing trade barriers, the Islamic Republic News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Kursat Tuzmen, Turkish undersecretary for foreign trade, said
that Iran and Turkey should expand their trade, which has declined
sharply in recent years.
</P>
<P>
In his meeting with Iranian officials, Tuzmen also proposed the
formation of a joint council of traders between the two neighbors
as a way to promote bilateral trade.
</P>
<P>
The value of trade between Iran and Turkey was about 2.3 billion
U.S. dollars in 1985, but has sharply declined to the present level
of 600 million dollars, according to the official.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the two countries can complement each other's
industries, adding that Turkey can ease its gas and oil shortage
through Iranian supply while it can provide Iran with desired
goods.
</P>
<P>
Economic relations between Iran and Turkey have been fluctuating
over the past 20 years, and Iranian officials believe the two
countries can cooperate in the fields including car manufacturing,
production of durable goods, energy, and oil and gas.
</P>
<P>
Tuzmen, heading a 140-member trade delegation representing some
110 Turkish companies, also held talks with Iranian Minister of
Industries Gholamreza Shafei on expansion of bilateral economic,
industrial and trade ties.
</P>
<P>
The two sides cited production of vehicle parts, food industry
technology, construction materials, petrochemicals and steel as
potential areas of cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish delegation arrived here on Sunday with an aim of
expanding commercial ties and making joint ventures with Iran, IRNA
said.
</P>
<P>
Their visit was also believed meant to mend fences after

<HEADLINE> Former Iranian Speaker Appointed Advisor to Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Iran's paramount leader Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei on Sunday appointed former Majlis (parliament) Speaker Ali
Akbar Nateq Nouri as his personal advisor and member of the
powerful State Expediency Council (SEC).
</P>
<P>
In a decree, Khamenei praised Nouri's services as speaker for
two consecutive terms and hoped the nation would continue to
benefit from his services in the new post, the Islamic Republic
News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
As a leader of the conservative camp, Nouri quitted the February
parliamentary elections in which the reformist allies of President
Mohammad Khatami won a landslide victory.
</P>
<P>
He has started to work full time as head of Inspection Office of
the leader after he stepped down as speaker, IRNA said.
</P>
<P>
The new Majlis, dominated by reformists, officially started work
on Saturday, paving the way for cooperation between the legislative
body and the government in push forward reforms advocated by
Khatami.
</P>
<P>
Nouri, 57, once served as representative of late Iranian supreme
leader Ayatollah Musavi Khomeini. He was a parliament member,
interior minister from 1981-85 and Majlis speaker from 1992 on.
</P>
<P>
He suffered a humiliating defeat in the 1997 presidential
elections, in which his moderate rival Khatami won popular support
and elected president.

<HEADLINE> 2 Girls Die in Mine Explosion in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Two girls died and another seven
people injured when a mine went off on Sunday in south Lebanon,
local radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The mine exploded along the road near the region of Kafr Tibnnin
in the former Israeli occupied zone. Two girls, five and eight
years old, died on their way to treatment, becoming the first mine
victims since the Israeli withdrawal early Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The injured people, including four children, have been sent to
hospitals, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of Lebanese flocked to south Lebanon every day in the
past four days to see in person their liberated land. The lurking
mines pose serious threats to the Lebanese in the territory they
finally reclaimed after 22 years.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that Israel has laid thousands of mines in south
Lebanon. During his visit to Lebanon last week, U.N. Secretary
General's envoy Terje Road-Larsen promised to get mine location
maps from Israel in order to solve the mine problem.

<HEADLINE> Russia's Putin OKs Law on Ratification of Nuclear Test Ban Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Vladimir Putin on
Saturday signed the Federal Law on the Ratification of the
Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (CTBT).
</P>
<P>
This law was approved by the State Duma, the lower house of the
parliament, on April 21 and confirmed by the Federation Council,
the upper chamber, on May 17, 2000.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations General Assembly passed the treaty by a
overwhelming majority of 158 votes against three with five
abstentions on September 10, 1996. By April this year, 155
countries have signed the convention and 57 of them have approved
it.
</P>
<P>
Under the CTBT, signed in New York on September 24, 1996,
effective nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation will be
achieved by limiting the development and qualitative perfection of
nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it urges all countries to continue their efforts in
reducing nuclear arms at global level with the ultimate goal of
eliminating nuclear weapons on earth.
</P>
<P>
The treaty bans any test involving a nuclear blast.
</P>
<P>
It will come into force only after the last of its 155
participants, including the U.S., Russia, France, Britain, China,
India Pakistan and other nuke-potential states, hands its
ratification charter to the UN.
</P>
<P>
The United States, who has the world's largest and most
advanced nuclear arsenal, has not approved the CTBT. The U.S.
Senate rejected it in late 1999.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi arrived here Sunday afternoon for a brief visit to Syria,
days later than previously planned.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival at Damascus International Airport, Kharrazi
told reporters that he aimed to exchange views with Syrian
officials on the rapid developments in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
On the position of his country towards the Lebanese Islamic
resistance, Kharrazi said "We always stood by our brothers in Syria
and supported firmly the Lebanese resistance."
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese resistance will determine its destiny itself," he
added. Hezbollah, which spearheaded the resistance that drove out
Israeli troops, has been backed by both Iran and Syria.
</P>
<P>
Asked about if Iran would participate in the rehabilitation of
Lebanese liberated areas, Kharrazi said "We are interested in the
rehabilitation process in Lebanon." He underscored the necessity of
the participation of all Islamic nations in the rehabilitation of
what the Israeli occupation forces had sabotaged in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
"It is true that the Israel pulled out from south Lebanon but
the dangers are still there. We have to keep vigilant for the
Israeli designs," he warned.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian foreign minister and his Syrian counterpart are
scheduled to discuss the latest developments in the region with
emphasis on the Israeli pullout from south Lebanon as well as
issues of common concern.
</P>
<P>
Late last week Kharrazi visited Lebanon and inspected the
southern border areas, in the wake of the Israeli withdrawal by
early Wednesday which ended the 22-year occupation by Jewish
troops.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Center Party Agrees on Acting Chairman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Israel's Center Party headed by
the outgoing Transportation Minister Yitzhak Mordechai decided on
Sunday that the party's number two man, Tourism Minister Amnon
Lipkin-Shahak, will be the acting head in the interim period.
</P>
<P>
The party also demanded that the party retain the transportation
portfolio. Mordechai resigned earlier Sunday in the face of charges
that he sexually assaulted three women over the past years.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the party convened in the afternoon to discuss the
steps following Mordechai's resignation. If agreed upon, Shahak
will assume the post of transportation minister and transfer the
tourism portfolio to the party's number three man Dan Meridor, who
currently chairs the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Ehud Barak announced at the beginning of his
cabinet meeting that he had received Mordechai's letter of
resignation, which is to take effect in 48 hours. In the letter,
Mordechai said he was compelled to step down due to the
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
Israel's Attorney General Eliyakim Rubinstein decided on
Thursday to charge Mordechai, who heads the Center Party which has
six seats in the parliament, on three counts of sexual abuse.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai, once a candidate for the premiership, has insisted on
his innocence. If convicted, he could face up to seven years in
prison.
</P>
<P>
The scandal first surfaced in March when a 23-year-old female
employee in his office filed a police complaint. At least two more
women have gone to police to claim that they were also abused
sexually by Mordechai.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai, 55, served as defence minister in the government of
Benjamin Netanyahu. He formed the Center Party after being fired to
run for the premiership with Netanyahu and Barak.
</P>
<P>
But he dropped out out of the race on the eve of the ballot
after sensing he had no hope to win.

<HEADLINE> Women to Drive Taxis in Dubai for First Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Seven taxis driven by Arab women
in long skirts are going to hit the roads of Dubai, the United Arab
Emirates, on Thursday when the service begins, local media reported
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Dubai Transport Corporation (DTC) has decided to introduce
this service to cater to women passengers and their families who
feel more comfortable with a woman at the wheel.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time that women are allowed to provide this kind
of service in the Gulf Cooperation Council countries, which also
include Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar and Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
A DTC official was quoted as saying that the new service, which
will be available from 6 a.m to 10 p.m., will only be available to
people booking the taxis by phone, and not to those flagging them
down in the street.
</P>
<P>
The first women drivers, who are from the UAE, Egypt and Sudan,
said they will have to overcome social stereotypes and prejudices
in their choice of the new career.
</P>
<P>
The welfare of the newly-recruited women drivers will be looked
after by a woman inspector who has been authorized by Dubai Police
to have full powers of inspection, added the official.
</P>
<P>
If the project succeeds, a further 23 taxis driven by women will
soon be introduced by DTC. Local media said the women drivers are
all enthusiastic about their new job, asking "if women can be
pilots and fly, why not drive a taxi?"
</P>
<P>
It is known that woman-driving is strictly prohibited in some
GCC countries such as Saudi Arabia, said the UAE's official news
agency WAM.

withdrew from the Lebanese territory after 22 years of occupation.
</P>

<P>
CAIRO, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian police detained 15 suspected
members of the banned Muslim fundamentalist group, the Muslim
Brotherhood, in the past 10 days, security officials said on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Higher state security chief prosecutor Hisham Saraya has ordered
the detention of the suspects for 15 days pending investigations,
the officials said.
</P>
<P>
The detainees, six from Cairo and nine from the Suez Canal town
of Ismailia, were accused of belonging to an outlawed group,
distributing newsletters to university students, possessing books
written by the group's founder Hassan al-Banna and penetrating into
student and labor organizations.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 members of the Muslim Brotherhood have been
arrested since October 1999, dozens of whom since the beginning of
this month, in a growing government crackdown on the movement.
</P>
<P>
The Brotherhood, Egypt's largest Muslim fundamentalist group,
was banned in 1954 by the former president, Gamal Abdel Nasser, but
has enjoyed intermittent periods of official tolerance.

NAIROBI, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia's aircraft bombed a new
power plant in western Eritrea on Sunday and damaged the project
seriously, said a news release by Eritrean Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The power plant, funded under a loan agreement with
international financial institutions, was near completion, the

</P>
<P>
According to the news release, "Ethiopia launched a large-scale

Eritrea accused Ethiopian troops of moving into these areas
following Eritrea's redeployment on Thursday under the 7-point
proposal of the Organization of African Unity (OAU).
</P>
<P>
"This act is a flagrant violation of the OAU peace documents
endorsed at the Algiers Summit last July which prevent any one
from moving its troops to areas of redeployment," the foreign
ministry said in the news release.

The clash between the two Horn of Africa neighbors renewed on

<HEADLINE> COMESA Free Trade Area Will Enhance Investment: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 28 (Xinhua) -- The launch of the Free Trade Area
(FTA) by the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa
(COMESA) on October 31 this year will enhance private sector
investment in the region, said COMESA Secretary-General Erastus
Mwencha on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Mwencha made the remarks when officiating at a graduation
ceremony at Solusi University, 45 kilometers west of Zimbabwe's
second largest city Bulawayo, where 195 students from different
African countries were conferred with degrees in various
disciplines, the Zimbabwe News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
He was quoted as saying that private sector interest in the
east and southern African states is something which has been
lacking for a long time.
</P>
<P>
"With the launching of the Free Trade Areas in October this
year there should be enhanced private sector interest in the
region including foreign direct investment," he said.
</P>
<P>
The FTA is expected to facilitate the free movement of
production factors such as goods, services, labor and capital.
</P>
<P>
To help support the integration arrangement of the east and
southern African economies, COMESA has established a number of
institutions which include a trade and development bank, a court
of justice and a clearing institution, Mwencha said.
</P>
<P>
He said it is pleasing to note that COMESA is growing as its
membership now stands at 21 countries, with a combined gross
domestic product of 170 billion U.S. dollars and a total of 380
million people.

LAGOS, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Sierra Leone's rebel Revolutionary
United Front (RUF) has freed about 300 children who had been
abducted to fight the government, the News Agency of Nigeria
reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted U. N. Spokesman David Wimhurst as saying in

Lungi by catholic charity, Caritas.

According to Wimhurst, both the government forces and the
rebels used child soldiers in the eight-year civil war, which
ended by a peace accord last year but flared again just over three
weeks ago following the abduction of U.N. peacekeepers by the RUF
rebels.
</P>
<P>
Children have been forcibly recruited as porters, spies,
diamond miners and sex-slaves. They were also sent into combat,
often after being given alcohol and drugs to deaden their fear,

BEIRUT, May 28 (Xinhua) -- A Lebanese civilians was shot and
wounded by Israeli border guards on the Israeli side of the borders
Sunday morning, Lebanese radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Ali Bergawi, 21, was injured with a bullet in the leg at Al-
Jidar Attayeb border crossing, about 500 meters away from the Fatma
Gate crossing, through which the last Israeli troops hastily
streamed back into Israel on Wednesday to end their 22 years of
occupation in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Bergawi was then carried back and sent to a nearby hospital.
</P>
<P>
The gate has been closed by Hezbollah guerrillas with a
bulldozer holding Hezbollah flag, three cement blocks and a burned
car to prevent jubilant Lebanese youth from entering Israeli
territory and stone Israeli soldiers, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of Lebanese civilians flocked to the gate everyday to
celebrate the Israeli pullout. They shouted slogans, waved flags,
insulting Israeli border guards and hurling stones at the Israeli
side of the border.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Sunday, Israeli soldiers fired tear gas canisters at the
crowed and fired rounds into the air in an attempt to drive back
the excited protestors, who crossed 150 meters into Israeli
territory.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese government will adopt necessary measures to control
the flux of civilians to south Lebanon, the radio added.

BEIRUT, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Israeli fighter jets violated
Lebanese airspace midday Sunday for the first time since the Jewish
state withdrew its troops from south Lebanon last Wednesday,
Lebanese Radio said.
</P>
<P>
The warplanes broke the sound barrier in Beirut and some other
Lebanese areas, believed here as a response to the defiance of
Lebanese civilians at the border with Israel.

Hundreds of Lebanese flocked to the now defunct crossing of
Fatma Gate, through which the last Israeli troops streamed back, to

Dozens of Lebanese protestors even ventured into a few meters of
Israeli territory. Israeli soldiers fired into the air and threw
tear gas canisters into the crowd to drive them back into Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The soldiers then fired rubber-coated bullets, injuring a
Lebanese youth.

<HEADLINE> UK Top Bosses Get 30 Percent Pay Rises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 28 (Xinhua) - Bosses of Britain's biggest companies
saw their pay soar by 30 percent last year - six times the growth
in average earnings and more than 13 times the rate of inflation.
</P>
<P>
A media investigation published Sunday reveals that more than
half of all top directors earn more than 1 million pounds a year.
</P>
<P>
The research by Financial Mail shows that the margin between
the size of boardroom wage rises and the increases given to
employees is the widest since the Eighties.
</P>
<P>
On average, the chiefs of the 100 largest companies on the
stock market are picking up 1.2 million pounds a year in pay and
bonuses - nearly 5000 pounds every working day and 50 times what a
junior hospital doctor expects to earn.
</P>
<P>
The revelations about boardroom pay come as many large
companies are shedding jobs. Nearly half of all the companies in
the survey have cut staff in the past year.
</P>
<P>
It is believed the enormous increase in director's pay is
expected to strengthen the Government's determination to curb pay
and perks in the boardrooms.
</P>
<P>
John Monks, General Secretary of Trade Union Congress,said it
was now clear who were the "guilty culprits"awarding themselves
excessive pay rises as the Bank of England warned of the threat to
inflation and interest rates.
</P>
<P>
Greedy executives are bringing British business to the brink of
a crisis, warns a leading US management expert.
</P>
<P>
Boston-based consultant Allan Kennedy says the UK risks falling
victim of the American cult of "shareholder value", in which
senior managers are offered huge personal incentives to drive up
their company share price at all costs.

<HEADLINE> Freedom Union to Withdraw From Poland's Ruling Coalition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, May 28 (Xinhua) -- The Freedom Union (UW), the second
largest party in Poland's ruling coalition led by the Solidarity
Union, decided on Sunday afternoon to withdraw from the government,
Polish Press Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The move is likely to put an end to the two-and-a half-year-old
government led by Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek.
</P>
<P>
The UW's executive council voted to pull all its ministers out
of the government, saying the Buzek government is no longer able
to carry out vital economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
These ministers will remain in office in a caretaker capacity
until a new cabinet is formed, the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
UW leader, Finance Minister Leszek Balcerowicz, told the
executive council that he did not rule out the possibility that
his party might cooperate again with the Solidarity Union under a
new prime minister.
</P>
<P>
"We don't exclude the possibility of renewing the coalition,"
he said at the opening of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Deputies from the Solidarity bloc have on several occasions
voted against the government's own economic reforms, which are
considered crucial to prepare Poland for joining the European
Union.

<P>
Yao Yi, who got his bioengineering doctor's degree from
Washington University in the United States, finally decided to set
up a high-tech company in the zone after conducting an inspection
tour around China.
</P>
<P>
"China's western areas are a large undeveloped virgin soil
which offers more privileges in setting up businesses than areas
in eastern China," said 38-year-old Yao, a native of Fujian
Province in east China.
</P>
<P>
His company is focusing on developing an anti-tumor radiation
treatment planning system which uses lasers to locate cancer cells.
The product costing millions of yuan has been sold to the United
States and Germany.
</P>
<P>
Tang Xiaohai, who returned to China from the Japanese National
Cancer Center Hospital, has developed a series of new medicines in
cooperation with some researchers in Chengdu University of Science
and Technology.
</P>
<P>
Some of these medicines and technologies have filled gaps in
China's own medical field, including the activated carbon particle
suspension lymphatic tracer. Once the tracer is injected into
patients who have lymph, the area becomes black in a minute, thus
helping doctors to locate and remove the lymph.
</P>
<P>
So far, 46 returned overseas students have set up 33
enterprises in the Chengdu High-Tech Zone and 60 more are due to
be established.
</P>
<P>
Incomplete statistics showed that nearly 20,000 students from
Sichuan are currently studying overseas and some 4,000 of them
have returned to China.

<P>
CHONGQING, May 28 (Xinhua) -- China has attracted many students
studying abroad to come back and sponsor high-tech enterprises in
the southwest thanks to the country's strategy to develop its vast
western areas.
</P>
<P>
James Zhao, 32, has just returned from the United States. He
sponsored a 150,000-US-dollar high-tech firm in the Chengdu
Scientific and Technological Park in Sichuan Province.
</P>
<P>
An Internet security system developed by the company is
expected to be turned out later this year. The system will provide
advanced techniques to prevent hackers and high-tech crimes.
</P>
<P>
"This is the happiest time of my life," said Zhao, "I can use
my knowledge gained from abroad to serve my own country."
</P>
<P>
Zhao went to the United States for advanced studies in 1992
after graduating from Chongqing University. Zhao got a master's
degree from the US Michigan University and then worked at Merrill
Lynch as a deputy executive, with a yearly wage of over 100,000 US
dollars.
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to create my own business here despite the hardships
and inconveniences," said Zhao.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has worked out a series of preferential
policies to woo back students studying overseas. High-tech parks
and gardens designated for these students have mushroomed in many
provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities.
</P>
<P>
In January this year, Chengdu took the lead in China to set up
a park in the high-tech zone for people with master's and doctor's
degrees to do research projects.

<TEXT>
<P>
Since the democratic reform, the education development in Tibet
has prospered, said Danzim, a senior Tibet educational official.
Over the past 40 decades, the central government has made great
efforts to carry out a series of measures for improving ethnic
education in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 20 years, more than 20,000 Tibetan young people
have been sent to high schools and colleges and universities
nationwide to learn many professions and specialties, Danzim said,
and over 5,000 of these students have returned to Tibet to make
contributions to local social and economic construction.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, governments at all levels have set up many
schools for Tibetan students in rural and pasturing areas. The
autonomous region has also established many educational
foundations which grant stipends to poor pupils and scholarships
to outstanding students.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the autonomous region has implemented a thorough
illiteracy elimination drive, and to date about 80 percent of the
young and middle-aged people in eight Tibetan counties have become
literate.
</P>
<P>
Tibet now has more than 4,000 schools at all levels where 350,
000 students are receiving an education, and some 83.4 percent of
all school-age children in Tibet have attended schools.

<HEADLINE> China Accelerates Restructuring Of Grain Production: Premier (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji has
urged the nation to push ahead the restructuring of agriculture
and grain production.
</P>
<P>
He did this at the end of a national working conference on
grain production and distribution held recently in Beijing. He
said the government will not relinquish its control over
purchasing grain to protect farmers from being hurt by further
drops in grain prices.
</P>
<P>
Since grain prices are dropping and some state-owned grain
companies are reluctant to buy grain at protective prices, lifting
controls over purchasing grain will trigger a further slump in
prices and hurt farmers' interests and their enthusiasm to grow
grain, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Vice Premier Li Lanqing and Vice Premier Wen Jiabao
made speeches at the conference. Also present at the conference
was State Councilor Wu Yi.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that the government's current policy on reforming the
grain circulation sector has proven to be effective. However, Zhu
said that there are still some problems that need to be urgently
addressed. Some local governments failed to fully implement the
policies of buying grain at protective prices and paying more for
higher quality.

<TEXT>
<P>
State-owned grain companies in the localities either refused to
buy grain or paid lower prices for quality grain. The continuous
slump of grain prices has reduced the income of grain growers and
discouraged them from growing grain. Some major grain production
areas in China suffer from severe shortage of risk-relief funds
and storage space. Restructuring agriculture and grain production
has encountered many difficulties.
</P>
<P>
Zhu emphasized that it is a basic policy of the government to
pay protective prices for and place no restrictions on the amount
of surplus grain that farmers can sell.
</P>
<P>
He urged various government departments and localities to fully
implement the central government's policy on reforming grain
circulation.
</P>
<P>
He asked state-owned grain companies to keep buying grain
throughout the year and prohibit them from refusing to purchase
grain or paying lower than protective prices for quality grain. He
said that local governments should conduct special inspections and
seriously deal with local governments and state-own grain
companies that violate government policy.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has decided to allocate an additional
eight billion yuan to the risk-relief fund for grain growers this
year. It will build ten million tons of new grain storage capacity
this year and another ten million tons next year.

<P>
Zhu said that the major part of increased risk funds and
storage capacity will be allocated to main grain production areas
in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has drafted a list of grain varieties
that it will buy at protective prices. It now encourages
provincial government-authorized companies to buy grain on the
protective list directly from farmers. It also allows county
government-authorized companies to buy grain that are not on the
protective list directly from farmers.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government encourages farmers to sell unlimited
amount of grain they grow in rural markets. It allows state-owned
or private companies that are authorized by county or higher level
governments to buy and sell grain freely at rural markets. It
strictly prohibits unauthorized companies to buy grain.
</P>
<P>
The national working conference on grain production and
distribution asked state-owned grain companies to accelerate
reform so as to become fully independent and responsible for their
own profits and losses.
</P>
<P>
The conference also asked all localities to accelerate
restructuring grain production and regard it as a priority in
restructuring China's agriculture.
</P>
<P>
The conference reiterated that securing self-sufficiency of
grain and grain safety is a long-term strategy of China. It
emphasized that safeguarding grain production and maintaining
farmers' impetus to grow grain are key factors.
</P>
<P>
Localities will establish a system of farmland conservation
zones in accordance with the law and strengthen the development of
water conservation and farming technology.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Foreign Minister Visits Azerbaijan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem
left on Sunday for Baku on a one-day official visit as part of a
reinforced diplomatic drive in Eurasia.
</P>
<P>
A Foreign Ministry statement said earlier that Cem would hold
contacts with Azeri leaders to further develop what it termed the "
perfect" relations now existing between Turkey and Azerbaijan.
</P>
<P>
Issues of energy, education and culture and regional and
international questions of mutual concern will be taken up for
discussion during the visit, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
Under severe criticisms that the Foreign Ministry is too much
preoccupied with the European Union and has ignored Caucusus and
Central Asia, Cem stated last week that Eurasia has a "very, very
important" place in Turkish foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
At a lunch he hosted specially for ambassadors from the
Caucasian and Central Asian countries in Ankara, Cem stressed that
one of the two top priorities of Turkish foreign policy is to be a
pivotal player in Eurasian politics. The other priority, he said,
is Turkey's membership of the EU.
</P>
<P>
Cem declared that his meeting with the diplomatic envoys could
be regarded as a help for the "action plan of the Foreign
Ministry."
</P>
<P>
Cem told the ambassadors that he would first of all visit
Azerbaijan and then tour the Central Asian Turkic-speaking states
in June.
</P>
<P>
Turkey is associated with Azerbaijan in a 1,740-kilometer Baku-
Ceyhan pipeline deal, signed in Istanbul on the sidelines of the
summit of the Organization of Security and Cooperation in Europe
(OSCE) last November.
</P>
<P>
Speculation has recently been spread that the future of the oil
pipeline project and the cross-Caspian natural gas pipeline project
have become uncertain under the backdrop of a deal struck between
Russia and Turkmenistan over the sale of Turkmenistan natural gas
to Russia.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Nepal-Bhutan Talks on Refugees Inconclusive  by Zhuang Meijie, Song Dejun </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, May 28 (Xinhua) -- The ninth Nepal-Bhutan
ministerial-level talks, which were concluded in Thimpu, capital
of Bhutan, Thursday, failed to produce a much-anticipated
breakthrough in the decade-long Bhutanese refugees problem despite
some progress in the verification process.
</P>
<P>
Much hope was pinned on this meeting as the Nepali Foreign
Ministry had said it would be the beginning of the end of the
problem.
</P>
<P>
Besides, U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees Sadako Ogata said
after concluding her shuffle visit between Nepal and Bhutan on the
refugee problem that Bhutan was preparing to welcome the refugees.
</P>
<P>
However, the only headway the two sides made at the meeting was
an agreement to name a refugee verification team within 15 days
and start the verification process within two months.
</P>
<P>
"The talks were inconclusive, though both of us agreed to begin
verification of the refugees within a couple of months," said
Nepali Foreign Minister Chakra Prasad Bastola on his return from
Thimpu Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
Although both sides agreed to start the verification process in
the near future, they did not agree on any details relating to the
verification, such as the forming of the verification team and the
modality of the verification, over which the two sides had
disputes in the previous talks.
</P>
<P>
The Bhutanese side wanted "some more time" to respond to the
issues over which they had views different from those of the
Nepalese delegation and "they will call me in a week on the
formation of the verification team," according to Bastola.
</P>
<P>
Most important of all, the two sides did not agree on which
categories of refugees who will be repatriated after the
verification.
</P>
<P>
According to agreements reached between the two countries seven
years ago, the verification will divide the about 100,000
Bhutanese refugees living in eastern Nepal into four categories:
Bhutanese who were forcibly evicted, Bhutanese who emigrated, non-
Bhutanese and Bhutanese with criminal records.
</P>
<P>
The Bhutanese authority only agreed to take back those who fall
into the first category while the Nepalese government insisted on
repatriating those who are Bhutanese.
</P>
<P>
Statistics by a refugees organization showed that 99.83 percent
of the refugees are holding valid documents that prove they are
Bhutanese.
</P>
<P>
Bhutanese Citizenship Act-1985 stipulates that those who leave
Bhutan voluntarily will automatically forfeit their citizenship.
</P>
<P>
"If a Bhutanese is forcefully evicted from Bhutan, then he is a
refugee. But if they have left on their own accord and emigrated
from the country..., we cannot call them refugees," Bhutanese King
Jigme Singye Wangchuk was quoted by Kuensel magazine as saying
recently.
</P>
<P>
Nepal maintains, however, most refugees of category two left
Bhutan under compelling circumstances.
</P>
<P>
"Those who fled were under psychological terror, under pressure
from local administration, and intimidation was also there," said
former Foreign Minister Ram Sharan Mahat after the conclusion of
the eighth ministerial-level talks held last September in
Kathmandu.
</P>
<P>
The refugees, most of whom are Hindus of Nepali origin,began to
flee Buddhist Bhutan 10 years ago.

<HEADLINE> Three Russian Servicemen Killed in Rebel Attack in Grozny </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Three Russian servicemen were killed
and another two wounded in a rebel attack Saturday evening in
Grozny, capital of the breakaway republic of Chechnya, said the
Russian military on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
At 7.30 p.m. Moscow time (1530 GMT) Saturday, about 30 rebels
launched a sudden attack on a military vehicle carrying Russian
policemen in Grozny's Zavodskoy district near the bridge across
the Sunzha river, killing three policemen and wounding two,
Interfax quoted Alexander Stolyarov, Russian Acting Chief Military
Commandant in the North Caucasus, as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Russian policemen, who were returning from a checkpoint to
their base, had to rebuff the strong attack. After a fight of more
than 30 minutes, the rebels retreated, carrying away the bodies of
the dead and wounded and leaving several automatic rifles and
grenade-launchers at the site, Stolyarov said.
</P>
<P>
The two dead policemen were members of a Irkutsk special
police squad and the third was from the interior troops, he said.
</P>
<P>
At the same day, a patrol group of the Russian Stavropol
region's special police squad hit a mine in Grozny, one policeman
was seriously wounded and other six suffered minor injuries, said
the Russian military.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 24 hours, Russian planes also kept bombing rebel
formations in the Argun and Vedeno gorges as a counterattack.
</P>
<P>
Su-24 and Su-25 combat planes have flown 14 sorties, An-26 and
An-30 reconnaissance planes two and Mi-24, Mi-8 and Mi-26 armed
helicopter about 40 missions.
</P>
<P>
According to preliminary reports, four vehicles, one mobile
communication system, and three rebel strongholds have been
eliminated, and one armored vehicle and 43 servicemen were
evacuated from the combat zone.

<HEADLINE> China's Industrial Base Ready for High-Tech Listings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Eight high-tech companies from
northeast China's traditional heavy industrial base of Liaoning
Province today announced their intent of being listed on the
country's anticipated high-tech Growth Enterprise Market (GEM).
</P>
<P>
"The move will help shake up Liaoning's traditional image as a
lumbersome heavy industrial base," said Vice governor Chen
Zhenggao.
</P>
<P>
He said that a high-tech company must capitalize on the stock
market.
</P>
<P>
China has so far approved 20 high and new technological
companies to be listed on the high-tech stock market which is
expected to officially open this year.
</P>
<P>
Peng Ruchuan, a senior expert from the China Development
Division under the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, said that the high-
tech GEM will create an effective channel to finance small and
medium-sized high-tech companies in China.
</P>
<P>
The world's first high-tech stock, NASDAQ, was set up in 1971.
It has since proved effective in boosting the development of
venture capital and technology innovations in America. In recent
years, bourses in Britain, France and Germany have followed suit
by pushing forward the "second board" for high-tech companies.
</P>
<P>
Since the high-tech GEM started in November last year in the
Hong Kong Stock Exchange, a total of 25 companies have been listed,
accumulating 10.6 billion HK dollars.
</P>
<P>
"Being listed on a high-tech board has great potential for
small companies," said Zheng Fu, general manager of the Dandong
Sikai Electronics Development Co. Ltd.
</P>
<P>
With a registered capital of 10 million yuan (about 1.2 million
US dollars), his company would be too small to be qualified for
listing, as it is required by Chinese securities regulatory
authorities that the minimum capital for listed company on China's
stock exchange must be over 50 million yuan (about 6 million US
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Liaoning has opened six major high and new technological
development zones. There are over 300 high-tech enterprises in
these zones. Their industrial output value reached 11.9 billion
yuan (about 1.4 billion US dollars) in the first four months of
this year, up 41 percent from the same period last year.

<HEADLINE> Five Killed by Lightning In South China Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Twenty-five incidents of lightning
occurred in the first half of this month in Hainan Province in
south China, killing five people and injuring three, according to
the provincial lightning prevention center.
</P>
<P>
The strikes also killed four cattle and damaged four houses and
a number of electrical home appliances, causing 500,000 yuan in
direct economic losses.
</P>
<P>
Hainan is prone to bolts of lightening striking the ground. An
average of 40 to 50 people die every year, and direct economic
losses exceed 10 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
The center attributed the frequent occurrence of lightning in
Hainan to inadequate lightning proof facilities in some buildings.
An inspection showed that 80 percent of the province's lightning
conductors are not up to scratch.
</P>
<P>
Experts also warned that lightning can also be transmitted by
other means despite lightning rods.

<HEADLINE> All Tibetans Have Right and Opportunity to Receive Education (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Cering, a 56-year-old educator in
southwest China's Tibet Autonomous Region, said that all people in
the region have the right and opportunity to receive a
comprehensive education from primary school to postgraduate
studies.
</P>
<P>
Cering said that he has witnessed a total transformation of the
educational system in Tibet from the old to the new.
</P>
<P>
Before democratic reform in 1959, there were only three small
temples in Liuxiang Village on Lhaze County, Cering's hometown,
the old man recalled, saying that in those days all 400 villagers
were illiterate.
</P>
<P>
Now, the village has a primary school offering regular
elementary education for 600 children, and four Tibetans from the
village, including Cering, have received a higher education.
</P>
<P>
Young people of about 20 years of age in the village are now
all literate, and are playing a major role in local economic
development, Cering said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the educational department of the autonomous
regional government show that before 1951, Tibet had not a single
modern school, and only some 2,000 lamas and nobles had the
opportunity to attend training programs at a number of official or
private teaching centers.
</P>
<P>
About 97 percent of Tibetans were illiterate in the old days,
and 98 percent of the school-age children in Tibet had no chance
of attending school.

UN.
</P>
<P>
In talks with Namibian Foreign Minister Theo-Ben Gurirab, also

<HEADLINE> mee052808hke-- Israeli Deputy PM Resigns Over Sex Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Deputy Prime Minister and
Transport Minister Yitzhak Mordechai submitted his resignation on
Sunday in the face of charges that he sexually assaulted three
women over the past eight years.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Ehud Barak announced at the beginning of a
cabinet meeting that he had received Mordechai's letter of
resignation, which is to take effect in 48 hours. In the letter,
Mordechai said he was compelled to step down due to the
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
Israel's Attorney General decided on Thursday to charge
Mordechai, who heads the six-member Center Party in Barak's
coalition, on three counts of sexual assault. If convicted, he
could face up to seven years in prison.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai, a one-time candidate for premiership, has denied any
wrongdoings.
</P>
<P>
The scandal emerged in March when a female employee in his
office filed a police complaint.
</P>
<P>
Since then, at least two more women have gone to the police with
similar complaints. Other women have alleged in interviews that
Mordechai sexually abused them during their compulsory army service
some 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai, 55, served as defence minister in the government of
Benjamin Netanyahu before being fired for planning his own run for
the post of prime minister in the 1999 election.
</P>
<P>
Trailing badly in the polls before the vote, Mordechai pulled
out of the race on the eve of the ballot, a move believed to have
helped clinch Barak's victory.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the Center Party will convene Sunday afternoon to
discuss the situation following Mordechai's resignation. The
party's No. 2, Tourism Minister Amnon Lipkin-Shahak, is likely to
head the party until a new leader is selected.
</P>
<P>
Shahak has made it clear that his party will demand that Barak
place the transportation portfolio in the Center Party's hands.
Barak assumed the role of transport minister about six weeks ago
when Mordechai announced that he was taking a leave of absence
following the start of a police investigation into the allegations
against him.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Chief Concludes Visit to Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 28 (Xinhua) -- James Wolfensohn, president of the
World Bank, left Ankara on Sunday after concluding a five-day visit
to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Prior to his departure, Wolfensohn said at the airport that he
had very positive impressions during his visit, which he described
as "very fruitful," reported the Anatolia News Agency.
</P>
<P>
He grant Ankara a 750 million U.S. dollar Economic Reform Loan
(ERL) which is aimed at boosting Turkey's structure reform in the
sectors of energy, agriculture, social security, telecommunications
and privatization.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Wolfensohn placed particular emphasis on bank
rehabilitation and urged Ankara to act swiftly on the legislation
that will subject public banks to commercial codes and allow for
their privatization in the medium term.
</P>
<P>
World Bank has on many occasions made it clear that Turkey must
pass by June 30 the legislation which will allow the eventual
privatization of public banks so that the Financial Sector
Adjustment Loan (FSAL) of 1.75 billion dollars could be approved
this year.
</P>
<P>
Wolfensohn explained during his visit that the FSAL had so been
held back due to the delay in the passage of the legislation.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the World Bank boss expressed satisfaction about
the Turkish parliament's resolve over the government's structural
reform.
</P>
<P>
As an award, it appears, Wolfensohn offered Turkey 5 billion
dollars of loans in a period of three years, up from an earlier
proposed 3 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The new additional 2 billion dollars are expected to come in the
form of Country Assistance Strategy, through which the World Bank
will support special projects.

<HEADLINE> Philippine MILF Rebels Blamed for Recent Bombings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The 26 suspected bombers arrested by
the Philippine police are members of the Moro Islamic Liberation
Front(MILF) and they are responsible for a spate of bombings in
Manila recently, a senior official said here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference here, Director General of the
Philippine National Police Panfilo Lacson said the 26 suspects
were arrested by combined police an army intelligence operatives
in simultaneous raids on three MILF safe houses in Maharlika
Village,Taguig, Metro Manila, early Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
The arrest of the suspects bolstered suspicion that a series of
bombings that have rocked Manila in the past four weeks were the
handiwork of the MILF to destabilize the country, he said.
</P>
<P>
Lacson said the police will file murder charges and frustrated
murder charges against Hashim Salamat, MILF chairman, and Al Haj
Murad,MILF vice chair for military affairs.
</P>
<P>
The 15,000-strong MILF, which is fighting for an independent
Muslim state in Mindanao, has been engaged in a war with
government troops in the past month.
</P>
<P>
At the press conference, three of the 26 suspects were
presented to members of the media. They were singled out by three
witnesses who were also presented by Lacson to the media during
the press conference.
</P>
<P>
Lacson charged that the suspects carried out the bombings at
Glorietta Mall on May 17 and at SM Megamall in Mandaluyong City on
May 21. One was killed and scores of others were wounded in the
two bombing incidents.
</P>
<P>
Lacson said that during the raids, the police seized pistols,
ammunition and other materials that could be used to make bombs.
</P>
<P>
According to Lacson, one of the suspects was identified by a
Megamall security guard as the one who brought a plastic soft-
drink cup into Cinema 6 in the shopping mall moments before the
bomb exploded.
</P>
<P>
Two other witnesses identified the other two suspects as
responsible for the bombing at Glorietta Mall, he said.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Civil Servants to Undergo Training in Private Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 28 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government is planning
to launch an exchange program for selected senior civil servants
to serve for short or medium term in some reputable private
companies and multinational corporations, a leading newspaper The
Guardian said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted the government source as saying that the
program would be carried out as a new policy initiative to improve
on the achievements it recorded in its first year in office.
</P>
<P>
Minister for Civil Service Matters Alhaji Muhammed Bello Kirfi
said that the initiative would be heavily reliant on successful
private firms to uplift the work ethic and consequently managerial
skills of public officers.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the cooperation between the private sector and
public officers was thought out by President Olusegun Obasanjo
last year.
</P>
<P>
Kirfi said, under the presidential instruction, he worked out
the modalities of the program and submitted his report to the
president early this year.
</P>
<P>
"It is interesting that it will form a part of the
administration's cardinal actions in its second year in office,"
he added, yet refusing to divulge the details of his submission.
</P>
<P>
Similarly, private companies will send their staff to
understudy ministries or extra-ministerial departments whose
activities have some bearings on their operations with the aim of
inculcating time-tested, profit oriented skills into the
management of the public outfits.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Hopes for Economic Cooperation With Germany </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Iraq hopes to open up new prospects
of cooperation with Germany in the field of oil industry, Iraqi Oil
Minister Amir Muhammad Rashid said on Sunday during his meeting
with a visiting German delegation.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Rashid said Iraq is keen to cooperate with
German firms to improve Iraq's oil industry, which has become
dilapidated due to the decade-long United Nations sanctions, the
official Iraqi News Agency (INA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Rashid also explained to the German delegation about the huge
damage to Iraq's oil sector by the 1991 Gulf War, the ongoing U.N.
sanctions and the almost-daily air attacks by the United States and
Britain over northern and southern Iraq, the INA said.
</P>
<P>
Besides the oil minister, Iraqi Irrigation Minister Mahmoud
Diyab Al-Ahmad also met the German delegation on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The minister said Iraq is willing to resume relations and
cooperation with Germany, and accused the U.S. and British
delegates at the U.N. Sanctions Committee of obstructing contracts
Iraq signed with foreign countries to import food, medicine and
other humanitarian supplies.
</P>
<P>
The German delegation voiced readiness to provide Iraq with
necessary equipment and spare parts in a bid to open a new chapter
of friendship and cooperation with Iraq, the INA said.
</P>
<P>
While meeting the German delegation on Saturday, Iraqi Trade
Minister Mohammad Mehdi Salah said trade ties between Iraq and
Germany "will witness important and big steps" during the
forthcoming period.
</P>
<P>
The 60-member German delegation, including representatives of
major German oil, industrial and trade companies, arrived in the
Iraqi capital Baghdad on Friday to probe ways of enhancing economic
cooperation with Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Forces Withdraw Totally From South Lebanon: Barak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 28 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli troops have completely
pulled out from south Lebanon after withdrawing from two outposts
in the Shebaa Farms area on Saturday, Prime Minister Ehud Barak
told the cabinet on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"The Israeli troops pulled out from two outposts and a small
strip of land of the Shebaa Farms area Saturday, thus completing
the total withdrawal from south Lebanon under the United Nations
Security Council Resolution 425," Barak said.
</P>
<P>
Barak told the ministers that the U.N. has ruled that the Shebaa
Farms, on the western foothills of the Mount Hermon, is not the
Lebanese territory and there is no need for Israel to withdraw
totally from the area.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. ruled on Tuesday that the Shebaa Farms, which Israel
occupied during the 1967 Middle War, is part of the Golan Heights
of Syria, and there is no need for Israel to hand over the area to
Lebanon during the troop withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
But Lebanese resistance group Hezbollah, or Party of God, vowed
to fight until Israel transfers this area to Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Israeli forces pulled back to three or four
kilometers down from some outposts.
</P>
<P>
Israel completed its troop withdrawal from south Lebanon on
Wednesday, ending its 22 years of occupation.
</P>
<P>
In the absence of Israeli troops, Hezbollah and other guerrillas
have moved in, taking control of south lebanon as well as the
weapons and equipment abandoned by the pro-Israeli South Lebanon
Army (SLA), whose sudden collapse earlier this week led to an
accelerated Israel's withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Middle East envoy Terje Larsen said on Friday that he hoped
the Lebanese army would deploy in the area vacated by Israel once
the U.N. formally declared that Israel had honored Resolution 425
calling for its complete withdrawal from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Larsen is scheduled to arrived here later Sunday from Beirut to
discuss with Barak on the U.N. rule in south Lebanon after Israel's
withdrawal.

<HEADLINE> 23 Wounded in Bomb Blast in Medan, Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 28 (Xinhua) -- A home-made bomb exploded during
Sunday Mass in a church in Medan, capital of Indonesia's North
Sumatera, on Sunday, wounding at least 23 persons.
</P>
<P>
According to reports reaching here, three hours later, a
similar bomb was removed from the city's largest church and
detonated by police.
</P>
<P>
A short time later, a third device was found outside a church
opposite Medan's largest shopping center.
</P>
<P>
The reports quoted North Sumatera police chief Brig. Gen.
Soetanto as saying the bombs appeared to be professionally made.
</P>
<P>
However, the police have yet to determine who was responsible
for the planting of the bombs.
</P>
<P>
Medan, about 1,300 kilometers northwest of Jakarta, has one of
the largest Christian communities in this predominantly Muslim
country.
</P>
<P>
Soetanto warned that the incidents were an attempt to stir up
communal violence similar to that in Ambon, capital of Maluku.
</P>
<P>
"This is an attempt to provoke riots in the city of Medan like
what happened in Ambon," he said,
</P>
<P>
Maluku has witnessed a year-long ethnic bloodshed between
Christians and Muslims and more than 1,300 civilians have been
killed.

<HEADLINE> Cambodian PM Returns From Paris Donor Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen
returned here Sunday from the Paris donor meeting, bringing with
him aid promises from major donor nations.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen was accompanied by Foreign Minister Hor Namhong,
Finance Minister Keat Chhon, Minister of the Council of Ministers
Sok An and other senior government officials.
</P>
<P>
At the fourth Consultative Group (CG) meeting held in Paris on
May 24-26, the donor countries pledged 548 million U.S. dollars in
aid this year to Cambodia, exceeding Cambodia's expectations, but
linked the aid to continued implementation of reforms.
</P>
<P>
"This is a satisfactory result for Cambodia, and a success made
by the royal government," Sok An told a news briefing at the
airport. Cambodia was seeking 500 million U.S. dollars in aid for
this year out of a total of 1.5 billion dollars for the next three
years.
</P>
<P>
"But we must continue to work hard to implement various reforms
and eliminate corruption," he added.
</P>
<P>
In Paris, the Cambodian government presented its report on what
has been achieved in the reform process since the formation of the
second coalition government in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Donor nations affirmed the achievements Cambodia has scored in
its reform efforts, especially in its fight against illegal
logging and in democracy, but the donor countries also urged
Cambodia to speed up the reforms of justice, administration, land
and demobilization.
</P>
<P>
From 1992-98, Cambodia received 2.7 billion U.S. dollars from
donors, according to an October report by Finance Minister Keat
Chhon.
</P>
<P>
A total of 16 donor countries and seven international finance
organizations attended the three-day meeting hosted by the World
Bank.
</P>
<P>
At the last CG meeting held in February 1999 in Tokyo, Cambodia
got 470 million dollars in aid, exceeding Cambodia's request for
450 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
In return, Hun Sen promised to undertake such reform efforts as
downsizing the armed forces and cracking down on illegal logging
and corruption. He also agreed to allow donor nations to check on
the progress of reforms every three months.
</P>
<P>
The next donor conference for Cambodia will be held in Tokyo
next year. It is said that the annual CG meeting in future could
be held between Paris, Tokyo and Cambodia.

 Aventis Eyes China Market
</P>
<P>
Germany-based Aventis Pharma AG, newly-established through the
merger of pharmaceutical giants Rhone-Poulenc Rorer and Hoechst
Marion Roussel, said it will continue to invest in China by
focusing on medical research and innovation.
</P>
<P>
Aventis said it also plans to support medical information
services and production management, and will bring into China some
of its most innovative medicines, developed through a total
funding of 2.4 billion euros (2.3 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Two new products, Campto for treating colorectal cancer, and
Amaryl, for diabetes, are expected to be sold in China this year.
</P>
<P>
In 1990, Aventis' two predecessor companies separately
established joint ventures in Beijing and Hebei Province. But with
the merger late last year, Aventis decided to move its China
headquarters to Shanghai. In addition, Aventis now operates 10
sales branches and has 500 employees around the country.
</P>
<P>

Health Publishing House.
</P>
<P>
The book, now available in Beijing and Shanghai, not only
covers all kinds of human diseases, but also provides health
information about the male, the female and the child, as well as
knowledge about medicine. It can be used by ordinary readers as a
reference for daily health care.
</P>
<P>
The aim of publishing the Chinese version was to spread medical
knowledge among the Chinese people while increasing their
awareness of the importance of health promotion, according to MSD
China.
</P>
<P>

China's pharmaceutical companies by the year 2003.
</P>
<P>

Harbin to Build Asia's Biggest TCM Powder Injection Plant
</P>
<P>
Harbin Pharmaceutical Group, China's main traditional Chinese

into the biggest TCM powder injection producing base in Asia.
</P>

workshop in the Second Harbin TCM Factory into a modernized one
compliant with Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) standards.
</P>
<P>
Annual capacity of powder injections in the factory will reach
150 million, the biggest in Asia, after the ongoing second-phase
project is completed by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>

which use boiled herbal compounds, is more convenient and
effective for users.
</P>
<P>

famous for its recently-developed powder injection for influenza
and colds, Shuang Huang Lian, which has created 180 million yuan (

<HEADLINE> Australians March in Support of Reconciliation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of thousands of
Australians walked across the Sydney Harbor Bridge Sunday in
support of national reconciliation in the country.
</P>
<P>
The march, organized by the Council of Aboriginals and Torre
Strait Islanders (ATSIC), was aimed at reaching reconciliation
between the Aboriginals and white settlers.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Associated Press quoted ATSIC Chairman Geoff
Clark as saying he had received unofficial estimates that up to
one million people had crossed the bridge.
</P>
<P>
Police said walking on the bridge had been expected to cease at
noon, but there were still thousands of people lining up to show
their support. The deadline was being reviewed continually and the
bridge would not be reopened to traffic at 03:00 pm as scheduled,
they said.
</P>
<P>
In the past ten years, Australian Aboriginals and their white
supporters have been fighting for an official apology for all
injustice in the history against them.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister John Howard did not take part in the walk while
the federal government was represented by two ministers --
Aboriginal Affairs Minister John Herron and Reconciliation
Minister Philip Ruddock. Opposition leader Kim Beazley and New
South Wales state Premier Bob Carr were among the first to make
the trek.
</P>
<P>
Many of marchers were dressed in the traditional Aboriginal
colors of black, red and yellow. The skyline was also littered
with balloons in the traditional Aboriginal colors.
</P>
<P>
A Police Operation Commander said the crowds gathered early at
the northern approaches to the bridge and began the walk at 08:00
am as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
"Despite chilly conditions, tens of thousands began making
their way across the bridge - many in family groups," he said.
</P>
<P>
The federal government led by Howard was reluctant to say sorry
on behalf of the nation at Corroboree 2000 on Saturday at Sydney
Opera House. He was heckled and booed when he delivered his 10-
minute speech.
</P>
<P>
ATSIC Commissioner for Sydney Perkins said Howard was going to
lose his prime ministership at the next election.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said Australia's image
overseas would not be damaged by scenes at Corroboree 2000. He
said people around the world generally understood that where there
were indigenous and settler communities there would always be
difficult issues accommodating the different interests to work
through.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Specter of Inflationary Pressure Looms in India By Xiong Changyi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 28 (Xinhua) -- With the annual inflation rate,
based on the official Wholesale Price Index (WPI) crossing the six
percent to hit a 74-week high, specter of inflationary pressure
looms heavily in India.
</P>
<P>
According to the Reserve Bank of India, the annual inflation
rate rose sharply to 6.38 percent for the week ended on May 13
from 3.18 percent recorded a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Economists said fears have resurfaced over the return of
inflationary pressure in the economy and more of a worry is the
pace at which the inflation rate has risen.
</P>
<P>
The average inflation rate was barely three percent for the
1999-2000 fiscal year, the lowest in the last 20 years. At the end
of the previous fiscal year, the annual inflation rate stood at 3.
74 percent, but in just five weeks, it has shot up to the current
level of 6.38 percent.
</P>
<P>
Experts of the Finance Ministry say the current rise in the
inflation rate is due almost entirely to the energy group, which
has pushed up inflation by two percentage points.
</P>
<P>
The steep increase in prices of petroleum products has been
instituted by the government as a result of the renewed firming of
crude oil prices in international markets.
</P>
<P>
Some economists and policy-makers maintain that the present
situation is no cause for alarm, saying that the core group of
items in the WPI, mainly comprising manufactured products and
primary articles which generally fuel inflationary expectations,
are still under control.
</P>
<P>
In fact, several manufactured items have actually seen their
prices drop on a point-to-point basis.
</P>
<P>
However, others feel that even if the current level of
inflation does not push up inflationary expectations, there is a
distinct possibility of it not only leading to higher interest
rates, but also eroding the rupee, which recently hit a record low.

<HEADLINE> China Speeds up Railway Construction in Northwest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, May 28 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government has decided
to build at least six railway lines in underdeveloped northwest
China in the coming five years.
</P>
<P>
This will be the third surge of railway construction in the
region in 50 years. The previous two were in the late 1950s and
early 1960s, and in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
New roads on the agenda will be a double-track rail linking
Baoji in Shaanxi Province with Lanzhou, capital of Gansu Province;
a rail between Xi'an, capital of Shaanxi, and Hefei, capital of
Anhui Province; a rail between Northern Shenmu and northern Yan'an;
and an international rail.
</P>
<P>
The double-track railway between Baoji and Lanzhou will cost 10
billion yuan. When the road opens to traffic, travel time between
the two cities will be cut from present nine hours to five and a
half hours.
</P>
<P>
The 955-km-long Xi'an-Hefei railway is the first east-west road
in the region. The estimated investment is 23 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
In addition, part of the railway section linking Qinghai with
Tibet has been electrified to facilitate China's massive efforts
to raise the speed of trains across the country to meet the needs
of the national economy and to sharpen the competitive edge of
railways on the whole transport market.
</P>
<P>
At present, there are 12,000 km of rails in northwest China,
accounting for 17 percent of the country's total length,
considered the lowest density of rail lines in the country.

<P>
JERUSALEM, May 28 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading Israeli newspapers on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- The United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) is in
close contact with Lebanese and Israeli Defense Forces (IDF)
authorities in effort to maintain calm on both sides of the border,
following several incidents over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
U.N. sources said on Saturday that the IDF pulled out of two
southeastern outposts before U.N. teams finalizes the Lebanese-
Israeli frontier.
</P>
<P>
UNIFIL has extended its patrols in the area that had been
vacated by the Israeli army. But it is not deploying the troops on
a permanent basis until Israel's withdrawal has been officially
verified.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Lebanese will temper its position on the Shebaa border issue,
thus paving the way for an expanded presence of the UNIFL in south
Lebanon, according to U.N. sources.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. is expected to confirm this week that Israel has
fulfilled its obligations in compliance with Security Council
Resolution 425 by withdrawing to the international border.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has accepted Israel's position that Shebaa area was
part of the Golan Heights captured from Syria during the 1967 war
and is thus unrelated to the implementation of Resolution 425.
Lebanon has been demanding that Israel completely withdraw from
Shebaa.
</P>
<P>
Israel has evacuated an outpost near Shebaa, a move claimed by
the Israeli army as based on tactical considerations.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli President Ezer Weizman has indicated that he will
resign from his post by July 10 or 11 at the latest. He is to meet
Prime Minister Ehud Barak on Sunday at the President's residence.

<P>
Knesset (Parliament) Speaker Avraham Burg revealed that the
Knesset would select the new president in a secret vote on August
1. Burg will serve as acting-president until a new president is
elected in accordance with the law.
</P>
<P>
Weizman decided to resign after Attorney General Elyakim
Rubinstein and State Prosecutor issued a report criticizing the
president's behavior in accepting more than 300,000 U.S. dollars
from two businessmen while serving as a Knesset member and
minister.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- The IDF and Shin Bet security service will start interviewing
South Lebanon Army (SLA) men who arrived in Israel after the SLA
collapsed last week. The objective is to assess how many will
immigrate and how many will stay in Israel, as well as to search
for possible Hezbollah agent that may have sneaked into Israel.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Ruling Party Backs Zimbabwe Land Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 28 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's ruling African
National Congress (ANC) came out on in support of Zimbabwe's
ruling party by strongly criticizing British government over the
country's land crisis after a meeting between the two parties in
Johannesburg on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The ANC secretary general Kgalema Motlanthe said: "The ANC does
not accept any conditions put on funds (for land reform) by the
British government."
</P>
<P>
The British government should not attach a list of instructions
to funding, Motlanthe said: "It is filibustering aimed at
compounding an already difficult situation ... we believe that is
their intention," he said.
</P>
<P>
Motlanthe denied that the Zimbabwe African National
Union-Patriot Front (Zanu- pf) government was using the land issue
as an opportunistic political weapon to offset the consequences of
a deteriorating economic and political situation.
</P>
<P>
Head of the Zimbabwe delegation attending the meeting, Zanu-PF
national chairman and Minister of Local Government and Housing,
John Nkomo, said if the British government did not deliver funds
to pay farmers for their land, the government would go ahead with
its planned takeovers but he could not say whether the farmers
would be issued notices of eviction before or after the upcoming
June election.
</P>
<P>
"But the exercise is on ... we're developing an accelerated
land reform and redistribution program," said Nkomo.
</P>
<P>
Nkomo said the British had reneged on their promises of funding
land reform made at the 1980 Lancaster House agreement and again
at the 1998 Harare land conference.
</P>
<P>
He said the election would go ahead next month "as provided for
by the laws of Zimbabwe" and that meanwhile efforts were being
made to quell the political violence spreading in the country.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the about 86,000 whites with dual Zimbabwean and
British citizenship, Nkomo said they would not be excluded from
the election process as they could register and vote as permanent
residents. But they could not vote as Zimbabwean citizens as they
still had British citizenship, which was in contravention of the
country's laws.

<P>
NAIROBI, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Food prices have shot up
dramatically across Kenya as the prolonged drought persists,
fueling fears of severe shortages ahead.
</P>
<P>
In the worst-hit areas by the drought in the east African
country, market prices of grain are soaring by 200 percent over
last month while price increases for other commodities are not
high, the Sunday Standard newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
A countrywide survey by the paper revealed that worrying levels
of food supply as speculators take advantage of the situation.
</P>
<P>
In most areas of Kenya, the prices of maize, beans and potatoes
rose by more than 50 percent due to the failure of long rains
from March to May, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan president Daniel arap Moi appealed to the international
community on Wednesday for urgent assistance, citing that 23
million Kenyans, 80 percent of the country's population, were
likely to starve following the lack of rains in the current
planting season.
</P>
<P>
Water rationing will start next week in Kenya's capital Nairobi
and power rationing has been imposed since last September due to
low water levels at dams and reservoirs.

<HEADLINE> Israeli President to Resign in 6 Weeks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Israeli President Ezer Weizman
plans to resign by July 11, three years before his tenure expires,
Presidential Director-General Arye Shumer informed Knesset
(parliament) Speaker Avraham Burg Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
Elections for a new president are scheduled to be held on July
30 or August 1, before the Knesset takes its summer recess, which
begins August 4, Burg's office announced Saturday night, reported
Israel Radio on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Weizman, 76, announced his resignation plan after Attorney-
General Elyakim Rubinstein's decision Wednesday not to press
criminal charges against him, while chided him for ethical
violations.
</P>
<P>
Rubinstein said in his decision that the president had behaved
in an improper manner by accepting more than 30,000 U.S. dollars as
gifts while serving as Knesset member and minister 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Rubinstein also said he was closing the investigation against
Weizman because the statute of limitations on bribery charges had
run out.
</P>
<P>
Weizman's decision came at Burg's urging, after Burg explained
on Friday to Shumer that Knesset members were liable this week to
start impeachment proceedings against Weizman, which would cause a
disgrace to the country and the presidency.
</P>
<P>
Weizman informed Prime Minister Ehud Barak on Friday that his
was going to resign in December. But his plan met with opposition
in the Knesset and some Knesset members called for his speedy
resignation.
</P>
<P>
Weizman is going to further discuss this matter with Barak on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The two leading presidential candidates are Regional Cooperation
Minister Shimon Peres for One Israel party and Knesset member Moshe
Katsav for the Likud.
</P>
<P>
The Likud is to convene a meeting on Monday to choose Katsav as
its candidate.
</P>
<P>
Peres, whom Israel Radio reported was supported by Barak, would
not comment on Weizman's planned departure or his candidacy until
it becomes official, Peres's office said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Burg, who is deputy president, will serve as acting president in
the interim period.
</P>
<P>
Burg spoke with Weizman, Peres and Katsav Saturday night about
the expected proceedings.

WASHINGTON, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Los Angeles Lakers reserve guard
Brian Shaw was suspended one game by the NBA on Saturday and will
have to sit out Sunday's Game 4 of the Western Conference finals
in Portland.
</P>
<P>
Shaw was punished for for coming off the bench during an
altercation in Los Angeles' 93-91 Game 3 victory over the Trail
Blazers.
</P>
<P>
The incident occurred with 7 1/2 minutes left and the Lakers
leading 83-74. As the Trail Blazers called for a timeout, Los
Angeles forward Rick Fox and Portland forward Scottie Pippen began
arguing and shoving each other in front of the scorers' table.
</P>
<P>
Shaw left the Lakers' bench to get involved, which warrants an
automatic one-game suspension.
</P>
<P>
The veteran guard is playing his 11th NBA season and first with
the Lakers. He averaged 4.1 points, 2.9 rebounds and 2.7 assists
in 74 games. In the playoffs, he has averaged 5.9 points, 2.2

<HEADLINE> China to See More Small Liners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 28 (Xinhua) -- The restructuring of China's civil
aviation industry has created golden opportunities for the MA60,
the country's new feeder liner designed to seat 60 people, today's
China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
The newspapers' Business Weekly said that the overall losses
suffered by China's civil aviation enterprises has caused many of
them to consider buying feeder liners.
</P>
<P>
It quoted Chen Jin, a division chief of China Aviation Industry
Corporation I, as saying that the 60-plus Yun-7 passenger planes
flying for domestic airlines will soon reach their lifespan.
</P>
<P>
This would be an opportunity for the MA 60, a propeller-driven
plane of 24 meters long and 8 meters high, to secure a certain
market share, said Chen.
</P>
<P>
Insiders predicted that more than 400 of the aircraft will be
needed in China in the next two decades.
</P>
<P>
Sichuan Airlines and China Northern Airlines have already
signed agreements with the Xi'an Aircraft Industry Group, the
manufacturer under Chen's company, to buy eight MA60s. Other
companies such as Guizhou Airlines and Chang'an Airlines have also
shown the intention of buying.
</P>
<P>
"We expect to sell 50 MA60s to domestic airlines in the coming
five years," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
"Prospects for the export of MA60s are rosy so long as we
obtain licenses from civil aviation authorities in foreign
countries," he noted.

<HEADLINE> China's Phone Makers Gird for Fight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 28 (Xinhua) -- China's mobile phone makers are
having a tough time with foreign phone producers controlling 96
percent of the Chinese market.
</P>
<P>
But Chinese producers are reluctant to give up on the rapidly
growing and potentially huge domestic market.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics indicate China had 43 million cellular
phone users last year, with 20 million to 30 million more expected
to join them this year.
</P>
<P>
The telecom authority is gearing up to strengthen its weak
cellular phone making industry. The Ministry of Information
Industry last year approved the applications of nine companies
eager to produce cellular phones.
</P>
<P>
The firms included manufacturers of electronic household
appliances and suppliers of telecommunications equipment.
</P>
<P>
The government reportedly wants domestic producers to win at
least 10 percent of the market this year and push for 20 percent
share in 2001.
</P>
<P>
Domestic producers seem excited, but hesitant about pursuing a
total sales of 5 billion to 7.5 billion yuan (602 million US
dollars to 903 million US dollars).

<P>
YANGON, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar and Vietnam Sunday exchanged
messages of congratulation on the 25th anniversary of the
establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
In a message to his Vietnamese counterpart, Senior-General Than
Shwe, chairman of the Myanmar State Peace and Development Council,
said the successive leaders of both countries have consistently
endeavored to maintain and promote the traditional ties between
the two countries, adding that there has been significant progress
in their bilateral relations over the recent years with the
formation of a joint commission.
</P>
<P>
Than Shwe said he firmly believes that the existing bonds of
friendship, mutual understanding and cooperation between the two
countries and peoples will continue to be strengthened in the
years to come.
</P>
<P>
In a message to his Myanmar counterpart Than Shwe, Vietnamese
President Tran Duc Luong said the establishment of diplomatic ties
has opened up a new chapter in the history of their bilateral
relations, adding that he believes such relations will be
unceasingly and further consolidated and developed in the coming
millennium.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Than Shwe, who is also prime minister of Myanmar,
exchanged similar messages with his Vietnamese counterpart Phan

bilateral mechanism -- the Myanmar-Vietnam Joint Commission for
Bilateral Cooperation. It is instrumental in enhancing fruitful
cooperation in various fields for mutual benefit, they said.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers of the two countries also exchanged
messages.
</P>

Since Myanmar and Vietnam established diplomatic ties on May 28,
1975, much progress has been made in the development of bilateral
relations. During a recent visit to Myanmar by Vietnamese Prime
Minister Phan Van Khai, the two countries signed three agreements
on avoidance of double taxation and prevention of fiscal evasion
with respect to taxes on income, cultural cooperation and
promotion and reciprocal protection of investment.

billion yuan this year, an increase of 22 percent over last year.
</P>
<P>

Province, donated 13,000 yuan to a mother whose 17-year-old son
was killed by a falling piece of iron from a building under

</P>
<P>
The mother will use the money to build a non-profit billboard

</P>
<P>
The article says that the much-anticipated May 20 speech by the

only what Taiwan would not do but nothing about what it would do
to improve the cross-Straits relations, the article says.

anticipation of the country's entry to the World Trade
Organization this year.
</P>

-- China's silver demand will increase by 30 percent to nearly
1,600 tons this year, predicted Zhang Changjie, president of the
Shanghai Huatong Nonferrous Metal Wholesale Market.
</P>
<P>
Zhang attributed the increase largely to the country's silver
market deregulation that began at the end of last year.

<HEADLINE> China's Agro-Exporters Overcoming Foreign Quarantine Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 28 (Xinhua) -- China's Exit-Entry Inspection and
Quarantine Bureau (SEEIQB) is seeking effective ways to help the
country's farm produce exporters overcome abnormal barriers
erected by foreign quarantine authorities, according to today's
China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The newspapers' Business Weekly quoted Yao Wenguo, a senior
SEEIQB expert as saying that foreign customs authorities often use
animal and plant quarantines as a technical barrier in trade to
block imports of China-made farm products.
</P>
<P>
Yao was the former deputy director-general of the State Bureau
of Animal and Plant Quarantine which was merged into the SEEIQB a
year ago.
</P>
<P>
He said that the bureau has announced major measures in effort
to boost the country's agro-exports in anticipation of China's
entry to the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
Under the measures, the bureau will improve consulting services
for Chinese companies so that they can keep informed about the
latest quarantine standards required by foreign countries for farm
produce sold to foreign markets.
</P>
<P>
It will provide technical support for agribusinesses to
safeguard the quality of export-oriented products. Meanwhile,
inspection and quarantine experts are expected to cooperate with
agricultural officials to import high quality seeds and fine-bred
livestock, Yao said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the bureau will focus its latest effort on paving
ways for the exports of cotton and garlic.
</P>
<P>
In order to ensure the sound development of China's traditional
overseas markets, such as Russia, Japan, Hong Kong and Macao,
quarantine officials will tighten their control over the quality
of seafood, fresh and live agricultural products.

MADRID, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Espanyol celebrated their victory in
the Spanish Cup by beating Atletico Madrid 2-1 in Valencia on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Barcelona-based side scored just two minutes after the
beginning with one of the cheekiest goals seen in Spain all season.
</P>
<P>
Atletico goalkeeper Toni Jimenez saved a shot by Toni Velamazan
and was bouncing the ball in front of him. However, Raul Tamudo
nipped in unseen, headed the ball away from Jimenez and beat his
former team mate in a sprint across the face of the goal, turning
the ball in from an narrow angle out on the left.
</P>
<P>
Sergio Gonzalez got Espanyol's second goal five minutes from
time to ensure the club won its first honour for 60 years.
</P>
<P>
Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink pulled one back for Atletico a minute
into injury time, but Espanyol were not to be denied.
</P>
<P>
Saturday's was the last ignominy in an embarrassing season that
will see Atletico relegated to the second division for the first
time since 1934.
</P>
<P>
Atletico had advanced to the final after FC Barcelona was
expelled for refusing to play the semi-final second-leg match
against the Madrid team.

<HEADLINE> China's Silver Dealers Expect Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Demand for silver in China should
be strong enough to lead an industry recovery this year, reported
today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The Business Weekly of the newspaper quoted Zhang Changjie,
president of the Shanghai Huatong Non-ferrous Metal Wholesale
Market, as predicting that silver demand will increase by 30
percent to nearly 1,600 tons this year.
</P>
<P>
Zhang attributed the increase largely to the country's silver
market deregulation that began at the end of last year, when the
Central Government relaxed its decades-old control on the silver
market and designated Zhang's wholesale market as the country's
sole silver exchange.
</P>
<P>
The People's Bank of China, the central bank, has ceased to
purchase silver. Silver producers and consumers are permitted to
make deals directly.
</P>
<P>
The relaxation of control is expected to stimulate demand for
the metal that had been used as cash by the Chinese through
generations, said Zhang.
</P>
<P>
The exchange has handled more than 400 tons of silver trading
valued at 600 million yuan (72.29 million US dollars) during the
half-year-old pilot operation.
</P>
<P>
"With improvements in the public's living standards, people
will need more silver jewelry, dishware and decorations," he said.
</P>
<P>
Silver demand will also surge in industrial production and
other new areas thanks to scientific and technological advancement,
he added.
</P>
<P>
More than 80 percent of silver consumed in China is used in
photoactive materials or in the chemical and electronic sectors.
</P>
<P>
"The increase in silver demand will contribute significantly to
alleviating a silver surplus on the domestic market," Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
China has reported an annual silver surplus of more than 500
tons from the beginning of the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that silver exports have great potential because the
world market supply is short by 9,000 tons a year.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation, the silver export quota for this year is 280 tons.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 27 (Xinhua) -- The New York Knicks overcame
injuries to their two big men on Saturday, taking a 98-95 victory
over the Indiana Pacers in the NBA Eastern Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
Facing a decisive situation after dropping the first two games
of the best-of-seven series at Indiana, the Knicks took the court
without star center Patrick Ewing, who is sidelined by a foot
injury. Marcus Camby, expected to pick up the slack in Ewing's
absence, went out injured early in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
With the big men gone, the smaller guys as New York guards
Latrell Sprewell, who had 32 points, 18 in the second half, and
Allan Houston, 28 points, took charge of the offense over the game.
</P>
<P>
Knicks' point guard Charlie Ward also contributed 14 points and
nine assists.
</P>
<P>
Pacers 2.23 meters center Rik Smits scored 21 points in the
first half, but Houston had 15 of his points in the first half to
keep his team close and Indiana managed only a 47-47 tie at
intermission. The Pacers fell behind by double digits with an
awful stretch late in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
Smits was limited by Knicks' center Chris Dudley and forward
Kurt Thomas to four points in the second half, and Pacers
sharpshooter Reggie Miller had 19 points but just two in the
fourth quarter, when he could have helped put his team within one
win of their first NBA Finals appearance.
</P>
<P>
Indiana's Jalen Rose scored 22 of his 26 points in the fourth .
</P>
<P>
Both Ewing and Camby could be available for Game 4 on Monday if
their injuries improve.

<HEADLINE> England Draws Brazil in Soccer Friendly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 27 (Xinhua) -- England played to a 1-1 draw against
Brazil in a soccer friendly match at the Wembley Stadum here on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Brazil largely dominated the field but never outplayed the home
side who went ahead after 39 minutes when Liverpool's Michael Owen
scored with an angled right-foot shot into the far corner of the
net which gave Brazilian goalkeeper Dida no chance.
</P>
<P>
It was Owen's sixth international goal in his 19th England
appearance.
</P>
<P>
Brazil pulled level 10 seconds before the end of the first half
after winning a corner on the right. Rivaldo found Franca at the
far post and the Sao Paolo striker, the target for a number of top
European teams, found the narrowest of gaps between Gary Neville
and the post to make it 1-1.
</P>
<P>
Brazil were content to play possession football for most of the
second half in which goal chances were scarce for both teams.
</P>
<P>
Substitute Roberto Carlos went closest with a fiercely struck
long-range free-kick that was just wide of David Seaman's goal.

<P>
ROME, May 27 (Xinhua) -- Spain's Jose Luis Rubiera took the
victory in the Dolomites as Italian Francesco Casagrande remained
the lead in Giro d'Italia cycling race on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
With a strong finish, Rubiera beat Italian Gilberto Simoni
after the 186-km 13th stage from Feltre to Selva Gardena, an route
over three mountain passes.
</P>
<P>
Casagrande was beaten in an uphill sprint for third place by
compatriot Stefano Garzelli but his four-second lead was boosted
to 18.
</P>
<P>
Wladimir Belli of Italy, who had been Casagrande's closest
challenger, dropped to third overall, more than a minute adrift.
</P>
<P>
Former Giro winner Marco Pantani's comeback after almost a year
without competition was exposed even more in this mountainous
stage. He finished 17 minutes 32 seconds behind Rubiera.
</P>
<P>
But Pantani's teammate Garzelli finished the day as the new
threat to Casagrande.

<HEADLINE> Italian Police Catches Greek Smuggling Ship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, May 28 (Xinhua) -- A crack unit of Italian finance police
boarded a Greek cigarette smuggling ship off the coast near
Italian southern city of Naples Sunday, confiscating over 5 tons
of cigarettes worth hundreds of thousands of dollars.
</P>
<P>
Italian news agency Ansa reported that the main smuggling
routes to Italy are now shifting from the highly protected
southeastern coast of Puglia to southwestern coast of Calabria and
Campania.
</P>
<P>
The main port of call for cigarette smuggling into Italy by sea
used to be Naples and the nearby coasts, but when police pressure
built up in the 1970s the trafficking shifted to the narrow
stretch of sea between the Balkans and Puglia and the traffickers
started running their cargoes here by land.
</P>
<P>
Now that Puglia is tightly controlled to halt various kinds of
smuggling - drugs, arms and illegal immigrants as well as
cigarettes -the action has shifted back to the Tyrrhenian sea.
</P>
<P>
The operation led to the arrest of 20 Ukrainians found on board
the ship named "Snow White". The four trucks and crew waiting for
the ship on shore managed to escape.

LONDON, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Britain on Sunday urged Fijian
President Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara to seek a peaceful and
constitutional resolution to the crisis in the South Pacific

in which Fiji's Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhry and about 30
others are currently held as captive by coup leader George Speight.

Sunday when a mob supporting Speight surged through Suva, capital
of Fiji, a former British colony.

"I am today sending a message to President Mara reinforcing our

and for the safe release of the hostages," Cook said in a

"I have appealed to the president not to yield to armed force
and to uphold the rule of law. I also repeated to the president my

CAIRO, May 28 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs from
the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
DAMASCUS -- Syria, for the first time since establishing its
Free Trade Zones (FTZ), has issued a regulation allowing the
setting up of branches for private banks in these FTZs.
</P>
<P>
The new law is valid only in the FTZs while absolutely ruling
out the possibility of establishing private banks in the rest of
the country at the present time.
</P>
<P>
Such branches will only serve the nearly 350 investors at these
FTZs, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egyptian medicine and pharmaceutical industry accounts
for 60 percent of this sector in the whole Arab world.
</P>
<P>
A study issued by the Egyptian Exports Promotion Centre (EEPC)
said medicines produced in other Arab countries cover the remaining
40 percent of Arabic market demand.
</P>
<P>
The study attributed the growth in pharmaceutical industry in
the region to the increase in remedy consumption per capita in the
Arab world due to the relatively improved living standard of the
Arab citizens.
</P>
<P>
In 1975, an Arab citizen spent 5.6 U.S dollars on medicine
purchase, but the figure has rised to 12 U.S dollars now.
</P>
<P>
RIYADH -- Industrial investments within the six Gulf Co-
operation Council (GCC) nations reached 80 billion U.S dollars in
l999 against 29 billion dollars in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Annual accumulated growth rate of this sector during that period
hit 11 percent which led to an increase in the number of non-oil
manufacturing industry facilities to 7400 premises housing as many
personnel as 567,000.
</P>
<P>
Such developments helped boost the combined output of the
manufacturing industries in the GCC countries to 23 billion U.S
dollars last year and step up the share of manufacturing industry
in the GCC's
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egyptian Prime Minister Atef Obeid said on Sunday that
20 percent of the shares of Egypt Telecom will be offered for sale
at the stock exchange in October.
</P>
<P>
The company's assets have been estimated at 24-25 billion
Egyptian pounds (6.96-7.25 billion U.S. dollars), Obeid said during
a meeting with a delegation of the German Industry and Trade
Chamber.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government will also partially privatize some oil
products distribution companies, oil refineries and a number of
public business companies of cement, fertilizers, chemicals and
paper in the second half of this year.

<HEADLINE> NATO May Consider Russia's Membership Within 20 Years: NATO Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 28 (Xinhua) -- NATO Secretary General George
Robertson said Sunday that he does not rule out the possibility
that Russia's accession to the alliance may be considered within
the next two decades.
</P>
<P>
However, the issue is not on the agenda of the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization yet, he told the Russia's RTR television
station in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
Robertson recalled that earlier this year when Russian
President Vladimir Putin was asked about the chances of Russia
joining NATO, Putin replied: "I don't see why not." Robertson said
he could give the same answer to the same question.
</P>
<P>
He declined to comment on Kremlin aide Sergei Yastrzhembsky's
statement that Russia may deliver preventive strikes on militant
bases in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The matter is outside the competence of NATO, Robertson said.
Still, in any case there must be some way out of the situation so
that force would not have to be used, he stressed.

<HEADLINE> WHO Urges to Curb Tobacco Tide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 28 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization (WHO)
has urged the entertainment, film and sports industries to help
buck the tobacco tide that currently claims about 3.5 million
lives globally each year and is expected to cause 10 million
deaths by the year 2030.
</P>
<P>
The appeal is contained in a message made public here on Sunday
by Director-General Groharlem Brundtland to the world over this
year's "World No Tobacco Day", which will be observed on May 31
under the theme "Tobacco Kills. Don't Be Duped".
</P>
<P>
WHO's decision to focus on the entertainment, film and sports
industries this year was a carefully thought-out one because
tobacco industry strikes where people least suspect it to be,
Brundtland said.
</P>
<P>
"Tobacco is a communicated disease -- communicated through
advertising and promotions with multi-billion dollars by the
tobacco industry," she said, adding that about 11,000 people die
every day due to tobacco-related diseases.
</P>
<P>
"Tobacco advertising featuring prominent sports and
entertainment figures project and reinforce the image of tobacco
as glamorous, fun, healthy, sophisticated and wealthy," she said.
</P>
<P>
She noted that such advertisements include "talk to us from our
streets, films, radio, television sets and sports events".
</P>
<P>
Everywhere there is something or someone telling you to smoke,
she said.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan President Pledges to Resolve Congo Conflict by Peaceful Means </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
has said that all the parties to the Lusaka cease-fire agreement
signed Last July have demonstrated their will to resolve the
conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) by
peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Ugandan Parliament at the International
Conference Center in the capital Kampala Sunday afternoon,
Museveni said that Uganda has from the beginning played a key
role in the formulation and subsequent negotiations for the
Lusaka agreement.
</P>
<P>
He said that a unilateral withdrawal by Uganda would be most
unwise because it would create chaos in the arrangements for
withdrawal of all the outside forces.
</P>
<P>
It would betray the trust the Congolese allies have in Uganda
and would not be in the spirit of the Lusaka accord, he added.
</P>
<P>
Lusaka accord has united all the forces in the DRC into one
plan of action which has provided for an orderly withdrawal of
all foreign forces, said Museveni.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the recent clashes between Ugandan and Rwandan
troops in Kisangani, the president said the leaders of the two
countries have agreed that such incidents must not happen again
and the two armies are working together to implement the decision
taken by the leaders to withdraw all forces from Kisangani.
</P>
<P>
He said the U.N. forces will exercise neutral control over the
 demilitarized zone after the troop withdrawal from the Kisangani
City.
</P>
<P>
The president has also urged officials of the two countries not
to make inflammatory statements in the press which can only serve
to cause tension between the two neighboring countries.

<HEADLINE> Uganda's Involvement in Congo Is for Security, President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
has said that the task undertaken by Uganda in the Democratic
Republic of the Congo (DRC) is enormous but crucial to Africa's
future as well as for security in Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Museveni made the remarks when addressing Ugandan Parliament at
the International Conference Center Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Uganda has no option but to act in self-defence to pursue the
bandits who were causing insecurity and destroy their bases in
the DRC, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Uganda People's Defence Forces (UPDF) has made a lot of
progress in reducing the menace caused by the bandits, said the
president, referring to the overrunning of the headquarters,
destruction of 15 camps and capturing of the leaders of the rebel
Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
He said the reasons why Uganda got militarily involved in the
DRC included "denying the Sudanese government opportunity to
destabilize Uganda through eastern DRC, denying Ugandan
dissidents such as the ADF habitation and preventing them from
terrorizing the region".
</P>
<P>
Uganda's military involvement in the DRC was also to ensure
that the administrative instability arising from rebel and
government clashes in eastern DRC do not destabilize Uganda and
to protect Uganda's territorial integrity against attacks by
kabila's forces, he said.
</P>
<P>
The president said the current crisis in the DRC was triggered
by the 1994 genocide in Rwanda and the forging of alliances
between the Congolese governments and the Sudanese government
against Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Uganda has its troops stationed in the eastern DRC, and went
into clashes with Rwandan armies on May 5 and 8 in Kisangani, a
northeast city of the DRC.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Museveni denied allegations that Uganda is in the
DRC to loot Congo's natural resources, saying that UPDF is under
strict orders not to engage in any economic activities on DRC
territory.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan government has welcomed a proposal that U.N. should
investigate and establish, once and for all, who is illegally
exploiting the natural resources of the DRC, he said.

<HEADLINE> WHO Warns Danger of Tobacco Use </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 28 (Xinhua) -- As the world prepares to observe this
year's " World No Tobacco Day" on May 31, the World Health
Organization (WHO) has warned the public about the dangers
associated with tobacco use.
</P>
<P>
The News Agency of Nigeria Sunday quoted a document issued by
WHO in Lagos as saying that this year's "World No Tobacco Day"
would be observed under the theme "Tobacco Kills. Don't Be Duped".
</P>
<P>
According to WHO, there are about 1.2 billion smokers worldwide
and 3.5 million lives are lost to tobacco use every year.
</P>
<P>
The organization estimated that the annual deaths from
tobacco-related diseases would have reached more than 10 million
worldwide by the year 2030.
</P>
<P>
Tobacco is used in different forms worldwide, but the commonest
forms are ordinary cigarettes, cigar, snuff tobacco, chewed
tobacco, pellets of tobacco soaked between the lip and the gum and
rolled tobacco which is used especially in rural areas in Africa,
the world organization said in the document.
</P>
<P>
What makes things worse is that youths, especially those in
rural areas, have cultivated the habit of smoking rolled tobacco
(tobacco rolled in the leaves of plants or ordinary paper) if they
cannot afford to smoke ordinary cigarettes, the document said.
</P>
<P>
The document noted that in whatever form, tobacco contains an
active ingredient called nicotine which, during tobacco use, is
absorbed into the user's mucous membrane from where it penetrates
the bloodstream and circulates through the entire body.
</P>
<P>
"Sooner or later, the tobacco smoker or snuffer gets addicted
to tobacco and develops a craving for it, even if he or she wants
to quit the habit," it said.
</P>
<P>
Studies have shown that the use of rolled tobacco places the
smoker at a great risk of contracting cancer of the tongue, mouth
or throat.

<P>
LAGOS, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo
has called upon African leaders to make their concerted efforts to
stop the deteriorating situation in the war-torn Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo made the appeal at his opening speech at the silver
Jubilee summit of the Economic Community of West African States
(ECOWAS) Sunday in the capital Abuja.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo said the sub-region "can begin to look forward to
becoming a crisis-free region in Africa" despite the recent
setback in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Sierra Leone's rebel Revolutionary United Front has renewed
hostility in violation of the 1999 Lome peace accord following the
early May abduction of the United Nations peacekeepers by the
rebel fighters.
</P>
<P>
After the opening ceremony, the ECOWAS leaders then went into a
closed session to tackle appropriate military response to the
situation in the crisis-torn west African county.
</P>
<P>
At a ECOWAS mini-summit in Abuja early this month, the
organization was planning to send back its intervention force,
known as ECOMOG, to Sierra Leone to help the United Nations
peacekeeping forces restore and maintain the stability in that
country.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian President Calls to Accelerate Regional Integration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo
Sunday called for total commitment and dedication at the highest
political levels to accelerate regional integration to stem
marginalization of the African continent.
</P>
<P>
The president made the appeal in his opening speech at the
silver Jubilee summit of the Economic Community of West African
States (ECOWAS) in the capital Abuja.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo recommended the creation of "an effective regional
consultative framework on economic reforms" to address specific
issues pertaining to integration of markets and in particular,
trade liberalization.
</P>
<P>
The 16-member ECOWAS was set up on May 28, 1975 with the major
aim, among others, to foster sub-regional economic integration.
</P>
<P>
The sub-regional share of world trade would be increased as an
enlarged community as against 16 fragmented economies, Obasanjo
said, adding that regional integration will help the sub-region
attain the 7 percent growth rate considered necessary to reduce
the level of poverty by half over the next 15 years.
</P>
<P>
Describing commerce as the engine of integration, the president
stressed the need or greater involvement of the private sector, to
enable the state to "concern itself with the role of producing
enabling environment for industry and commerce to thrive".
</P>
<P>
He also noted that the community's relationship with
development partners "needs to be re-focused with a view to
increasing access to their markets and support to make our
products competitive and secure increased inflow of foreign
capital and reduction of our debts in order to free our resources
for more productive economic activities".

<HEADLINE> OAU Demands Unconditional Release of All U.N. Peacekeepers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, May 28 (Xinhua) -- Secretary-General of the Organization
of African Unity Salim Ahmed Salim has called for "total and
unconditional release" of all hostages still being held by Sierra
Leone's rebel Revolutionary United Front (RUF) led by Foday
Sankoh.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony of the jubilee summit of the
Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) in Nigeria's
capital Abuja, Salim said his Addis Ababa-based continental body
would continue to work with ECOWAS and the international community
to restore peace to the troubled west African country.
</P>
<P>
The RUF rebel fighters violated the 1999 Lome Peace Accord,
which Sankoh signed with the government led by President Ahmad
Tejan Kabbah, and renewed hostilities in Sierra Leone where they
held about 500 U.N. peacekeepers as hostage in early May.
</P>
<P>
Under the strong pressure of the international community and
the counter- fight by the government forces, the rebels have
released in batches some 400 U.N. peacekeepers so far. However,
there are still hundreds of U.N. peacekeepers in their hands.
</P>
<P>
The blue-bereted U.N. troops, known as UNAMSIL, were deployed
to Sierra Leone in April to supervise the disarmament and
demobilization of combatants following the departure of the
sub-regional peace monitoring force, known as ECOMOG, under the
Lome Peace Accord.
</P>
<P>
Also speaking at the summit, Oluyemi Adeniji, U.N. special
envoy to Sierra Leone, stressed that negotiations to bring the
Lome accord back on track must resume after the release of all the
hostages.
