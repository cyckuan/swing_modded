YOUNG, OLD RECALL BIG WILT
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Jon Harris wore a Kobe Bryant jersey. Hassan
Shamir had the familiar No. 23 of a guy named Jordan. They braved
the heat for some one-on-one at Reseda Recreational Park, unaware
one of the basketball's giants, literally and figuratively, died a
few hours before.
</P>
<P>
   Wilt Chamberlain, who won two NBA championships, including one
with the Lakers, was found dead at his Bel-Air home Tuesday. He was
63.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, neither of the teen-age cagers knew much about
Chamberlain, though they were acutely aware of his standing as one
of the few athletes who shaped a sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was always on the highlights,'' Harris, 16, said. ``I
remember every time they showed him he was wearing a headband. I
know he played for the Lakers and they won a championship.''
</P>
<P>
   On basketball courts across the San Fernando Valley _ whether in
Reseda or Encino or Northridge or Woodland Hills _ most of the
players knew of Chamberlain, of his star magnitude, of his prowess,
and his now infamous proclamation of having slept with thousands of
women.
</P>
<P>
   However, the generation that monopolizes the playing time at
area courts know more about Jordan and Larry Bird and Magic
Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   The Wilt particulars are lost on the younger generations who
were either not born or too young to remember Chamberlain, who
concluded his career in 1973. Leave that to some of the elders,
like Zacharia Cambridge.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the strongest man I've ever seen play,'' said
Cambridge, 65, a longtime Lakers fan. ``I hear this talk about (the
Lakers' Shaquille O'Neal), but Wilt was pure strength. They had to
change the game because of him. Him and Bill Russell. I'll tell
you, there was nothing like those two.
</P>
<P>
   ``These players today, all those guys, they couldn't play with
either of those guys. Not for my money.''
</P>
<P>
   Sal Magliotti, 73, of Calabassas said he lived in suburban
Philadelphia when Chamberlain was playing for the Philadelphia
Warriors. Magliotti, ironically, grew up a Boston Celtics fan and
said he would take Russell over Chamberlain in the inevitable
``who's better'' argument but gave Chamberlain his due.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were times teams couldn't stop him,'' Magliotti said
while sitting on a bench at Balboa Sports Complex park. ``He was a
physical specimen. I can't believe (he died). Teams would
double-team him. Sometimes triple-team him. They did it all the
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``You knew, from the first time I saw him ... you knew he was
going to be great. Magic Johnson, Larry Bird, Michael Jordan? I
think it was Russell and Chamberlain that really got (the NBA)
going.''
</P>
<P>
   As word of Chamberlain's passing spread throughout the Valley,
the feeling was of disbelief and shock.
</P>
<P>
   Chamberlain, who played with four NBA teams and set a record in
averaging an 50.4 points and 25.7 rebounds a game during the
1961-62 season, was always regarded as one of the most
well-conditioned athletes in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Even as he advanced into his 50s, debate raged as to whether
Chamberlain, given a few weeks to work himself into better shape,
could play in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the younger kids see Michael Jordan, what he's done
to elevate the game,'' Leonard Symorsky said. ``Wilt Chamberlain
did the same thing when he was playing.''

CYBERTALK PRODUCER WANTS YOU TO BE A STAR
</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ron Diorio has all the tools to make ``you'' a cybersports radio
celebrity.
</P>
<P>
   From his home in New York, Diorio has been making cybertalk-show
stars out of Internet-savvy sports junkies for the past year on his
site, the Sports News Network (www.sportsnewsnetwork.com).
</P>
<P>
   His site is a portal for real-audio talk shows created by
everyday sports fans who talk about or interview sports figures on
subjects ranging from college football rankings to general sports
news.
</P>
<P>
   It's one of the pioneering steps toward practical use of
broadband technology, which Diorio recognizes as the next big step
for multimedia capabilities on the 'Net.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really believe that the next set of celebrities is coming
from the Internet,'' said Diorio, who evaluates cybertalk
candidates before granting them a show. ``I haven't found the next
Merv Griffin, but ...''
</P>
<P>
   Diorio has found Daryl Fein, who talks about college athletics
and professional baseball on the ``Fein Line.'' Fein brings the
kind of attitude that Diorio wants in his shows. Diorio doesn't
want radio shock talk, but a blend of information mixed with
personality.
</P>
<P>
   Said Fein: ``I like to present my work as I would like to hear
it if I were listening _ nothing too drawn out and too formal _ but
like you'd hear while sitting on a bar stool with the guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Another believer is Steve Kyler, who operates BskBall's
Hoopsworld (www.bskball.com), a fan-based site about the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the style of information that we present as a group,''
Kyler said. ``I think we represent the next generation of sports
commentary.''
</P>
<P>
   Diorio said he wants his cybercasters to already have a
following. That is why he approached Ross Fleege, whose site, The
Frozen Tundra (www.thefrozentundra.com), is one of the more popular
stops for Green Bay Packers fans.
</P>
<P>
   Fleege said the bigger companies, such as ESPN.com and CBS
SportsLine, have the resources to dominate sports information on
the Internet. Diorio's site gives the smaller companies a chance to
be heard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Online radio is the next big thing on the Internet, and I
think Sports News Network does a good job of capitalizing on the
potential of real-audio technology,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Diorio has all the hardware to make this concept work. It's not
been profitable, so far, but Diorio said he hopes to ride the
momentum to bigger things with broadband applications with this
niche.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying I'm ESPN,'' he said. ``On my site, you can just
hear different points of view. Our guys may not necessarily be Jim
Rome, just someone who's really knowledgeable about sports.''
</P>
<P>
   Diorio, a New York University film-school dropout, dabbled with
audio distribution in radio in 1995, but soon found the Internet to
be the best outlet for his work.
</P>
<P>
   Diorio, who also produces audio projects about medical and law
topics, said he's finding ``tons of creative people all waiting to
be heard.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe someone out of this group becomes a big star _ that's
great,'' he said. ``The site's success is not about me, but more
about people who put their effort into it.''

A WASTED OPPORTUNITY SENDS THE WRONG MESSAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The No. 1 question entering the National League
Championship Series was how the New York Mets could possibly beat
Atlanta after the Braves had manhandled them during the season;
worse, in the last three weeks. In trying to answer that question
objectively, members of the Braves looked at other factors.
</P>
<P>
   ``In these types of games, it's about execution, the least
amount of mistakes,'' Don Baylor, the Braves' hitting coach, said.
``The mistakes you make during the season, missing the cutoff man,
being thrown out at home, are magnified now.''
</P>
<P>
   Ozzie Guillen, a veteran utility infielder, said he didn't
expect pitching to decide the outcome because both teams could
pitch. ``Whoever puts the bunt better, whoever moves the guy over
better or plays better defense is going to be the winner,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In the third inning of Tuesday night's Game 1, the Mets had
Roger Cedeno at third base with no one out. The Braves had scored a
run in the first inning after only two batters, but now the Mets
had the perfect opportunity to match the Braves' run.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Maddux, the pre-eminent pitcher of the 90s working for the
pre-eminent team of the 90s, had easily retired the first six Mets
batters, needing only 21 pitches to breeze through them. But when
Cedeno led off the third inning, he drilled a line drive into the
gap in left-center field and scooted to second for a double. But
when the throw back to the infield from Gerald Williams, the left
fielder, skipped past third base, Cedeno hurriedly took the extra
base.
</P>
<P>
   Runner at third, no one out. Except for a ball hit into the
stands, this was the best opportunity the Mets could ask for to tie
the game.
</P>
<P>
   Rey Ordonez was the batter who had the first chance to make it
1-1. The shortstop, however, swung mightily at a Maddux pitch and
beat the ball into the ground. It was the type of ball that usually
rolls foul, so Ordonez strayed only a few feet up the first-base
line. The ball did not go foul; instead, it spun slowly a few feet
up the third-base line. It veered slightly, from the right side of
the chalky foul line to the left, but it stayed on the chalk.
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Perez, the catcher, did not give the ball a chance to veer
any more to the left. He pounced on it, took a quick glance toward
third to make sure Cedeno wasn't going anywhere and fired to first,
easily beating the stationary Ordonez. Perez then motioned to Ryan
Klesko, the first baseman, to watch Cedeno to make sure he was not
planning a belated and sneaky charge to the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Masato Yoshii was the next candidate to produce the tying run.
As pitchers go, Yoshii had executed his share of sacrifice bunts
during the season. His six ranked third among the Mets' pitchers.
So it didn't seem as if it would be an impossible task for him to
put the ball on the ground when Bruce Benedict, the substitute
third-base coach, flashed the sign for a suicide squeeze.
</P>
<P>
   With two balls and no strikes, Maddux went into his motion and
delivered the pitch. Cedeno scampered down the line. Yoshii turned
in the batter's box to get into position to bunt. The ball arrived
at the plate. Yoshii bunted at it. Oops. Bat did not meet ball.
Ball eluded bat and went instead into Perez's glove. Oops. Cedeno
was caught naked on the baseline.
</P>
<P>
   Perez ran at Cedeno, and the runner retreated to third. But
Cedeno was in no man's land, certainly where no base runner should
be with one out in a 1-0 game, and Perez tagged him for the second
out. Suddenly, a promising rally was not so promising. Yoshii
slapped a bouncer to Maddux at the mound, the pitcher flipped to
first and, just like that, with no batted ball traveling more than
57 feet, the Mets had lost the opportunity to pull even with the
Braves.
</P>
<P>
   They would eventually do that, scoring a run in the fourth
inning after Edgardo Alfonzo cracked a double that was not wasted.
But when Maddux, or any of the Braves' starters, for that matter,
is pitching, no team can afford to squander the kind of gift the
errant throw on Cedeno's double gave the Mets. It was almost gift
wrapped; only the bow was missing. But the Mets couldn't tie the
bow _ or the game.
</P>
<P>
   They went on to lose it, 4-2, leaving them wondering whether
they really had the ingredients necessary to beat the Braves.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been fortunate to beat them,'' Tom Glavine, Maddux's
fellow starter, said before the game. ``We found ways to win close
games. I anticipate a lot of close games and whoever figures out
how to win will win.''
</P>
<P>
   However either team won, Brian Jordan had said, the first game
was critical. ``You definitely want to send a message the first
game,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets didn't like the loss; they didn't like the message.
According to Baylor, a veteran of post-season appearances as a
player, they won't like what could come either.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the season,'' the coach said, ``you can get over a
defeat pretty quickly and go on to the next day. In a series like
this, it just grabs you and hangs onto you more than 24 hours
sometimes. Plus you can ride out a victory a lot longer if you do
well. The next day you believe things are going to happen for
you.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets may start believing, too _ believing that they can't
beat the Braves.

3 BIG BROKERAGE FIRMS' EARNINGS BEAT EXPECTATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By PATRICK McGEEHAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Three big securities firms reported
better-than-expected third-quarter earnings Tuesday, reflecting a
strong rebound from a disastrous comparable quarter last year but a
decline from a strong first half.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. reported the most remarkable turnaround from
a year ago, when it recorded a quarterly loss of $163 million,
after taking an after-tax charge of $288 million to restructure its
bond businesses. Despite a slight decline in its biggest source of
revenue, trading commissions, Merrill had its most profitable third
quarter, earning $572 million, or $1.34 a diluted share.
</P>
<P>
   Paine Webber Group, another firm with a national network of
brokers who sell stocks and bonds to individual investors, reported
a 67 percent increase in net income to $138.2 million, or 86 cents
a share. Paine Webber also said it was pleased with response to a
brokerage account it was introducing to compete with a new offering
from Merrill Lynch that allows customers to make unlimited trades
for a pre-set annual fee.
</P>
<P>
   A third firm, Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette Inc., weathered a
rocky market for the junk bonds it underwrites and trades to post
net income of $122.2 million, or 85 cents a share. That total,
depressed by heavy advertising spending for the firm's DLJdirect
electronic-brokerage service, nearly quadrupled the $25.7 million
the firm earned a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   In each case, the results were several cents a share more than
analysts had forecast. Investors reacted most favorably to
Donaldson, Lufkin's results, pushing its stock up $2.1875 a share,
to $42.50. Merrill's shares were down 75 cents at $67, and Paine
Webber slipped 68.75 cents, to $35, partly reflecting a broad
decline in the overall market.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in what's feared to be a transitional stage for the
full-service brokerage business,'' said Guy Moszkowski, an analyst
at Citigroup's Salomon Smith Barney unit. The industry is grappling
with Internet-based competitors, he said, and investors will remain
wary of brokerage stocks until they get a better sense of how the
competition will affect their earnings.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, investors are watching for the impact of the
firms' shift to letting customers pay annual fees for brokerage
services instead of commissions on every transaction.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Merrill rolled out a new account this summer that, for a minimum
fee of $1,500 a year, allows customers to make as many trades of
stocks, bonds and mutual funds as they want, either online or
through a broker. That move was a response to the growing
popularity of low-cost, electronic trading offered by younger
companies like Charles Schwab and Etrade Group.
</P>
<P>
   Some investors think Merrill has priced its new account too
aggressively and fear that the firm's return on customers' assets
will continue to decline. ``My reading of it is they're going to
execute a Schwab-killer strategy,'' said Steve Galbraith, an
analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Paine Webber chief executive Donald Marron on Tuesday emphasized
that the firm's 7,500 brokers have more ``flexibility'' in setting
the fees that different customers will pay for its brand-new
account, which it calls Insight One. Marron said Paine Webber kept
slightly less than $1 of every $100 of customer assets invested
with it and that he does not expect the firm's cut, which has
declined steadily over the years, to drop significantly because of
the new account structure.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill chief financial officer E. Stanley O'Neal said the firm
was pleasantly surprised by the effect the change had had so far on
its overall return on assets. But he added that the cost of
compensating brokers for switching their clients to lower-priced
accounts was the primary reason that Merrill's compensation costs
rose in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   For most Wall Street firms, the cost of paying employees moves
up and down in line with revenue. But Merrill's compensation
expenses edged up last quarter, while its net revenue _ total
revenue minus interest expense _ declined 3.2 percent, to $5.27
billion. Moszkowski estimated that much of that difference could
comprise one-time payments of $50 million or more to its 14,000
brokers, who stand to earn less from the new fee-based accounts.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal said he expected Merrill's ratio of compensation costs to
net revenue to move back toward 50 percent from 52 percent last
quarter. But, he said, Merrill's marketing costs will rise sharply
starting this quarter as it funds an ad blitz.
</P>
<P>
   On the investment-banking side of its business, Merrill had ``a
solid quarter, despite the difficult environment,'' O'Neal said.
During a volatile market for certain types of bonds late in the
quarter, the firm fared much better than it had last year when a
default by the Russian government roiled financial markets around
the world and caught Merrill holding a huge inventory of risky
bonds. Merrill also had strong gains in revenue from underwriting
stocks and bonds and from advising on mergers and acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   At Paine Webber, investment-banking revenue was up 12 percent
from a year earlier to $134.2 million, but was flat for the first
nine months of 1999. The firm's total revenue increased just 3
percent, to $1.86 billion, from $1.8 billion in the third quarter
of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Like Paine Webber, Donaldson, Lufkin said its third quarter was
so much stronger this year that it had already earned more in 1999
than in any full year. The biggest gains came from underwriting and
fees for advising companies on mergers. Overall, Donaldson,
Lufkin's revenue jumped 59 percent, to $1.7 billion, from $1.07
billion a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   In the junk-bond business, Donaldson, Lufkin's market share
jumped to 25 percent in the quarter and 20 percent for the year in
a market that has been upset by rising rates. &QL;

EDITORIAL: DANGEROUS COUP IN PAKISTAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, Oct. 13:
</P>
<P>
   The military coup in Pakistan is cause for alarm in South Asia
and the rest of the world. A nation newly armed with nuclear
weapons, and with a volatile history of wars and internal
upheavals, has been seized by generals who may be inclined to favor
a more confrontational approach with India. Suddenly, after fitful
steps toward India-Pakistan rapprochement, the subcontinent is once
again one of the most dangerous places on earth. Gen. Pervez
Musharraf, the army chief of staff who ``dismissed'' Prime Minister
Nawaz Sharif, acted only after Sharif tried to oust him earlier in
the day. But the United States and other nations must demand that
the generals ensure Sharif's safety, restore him to power and
respect Pakistani liberties.
</P>
<P>
   Coups have been a sadly regular feature of Pakistan's history.
But in the 11 years since the death of the last coup plotter, Gen.
Mohammad Zia ul-Haq, the country has stumbled through a succession
of civilian governments controlled by either Sharif or his main
rival, Benazir Bhutto.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the military has always lurked in the background as a
power, and civilian Pakistani leaders have understood that there
were limits on how much they could challenge the top generals.
Sharif may have forgotten that lesson when he tried to oust
Musharraf. He had also angered the democratic opposition in
Pakistan by his consolidation of power and trampling on the rights
of others. But such excesses cannot excuse the military's action.
</P>
<P>
   The train of events leading up to the coup may never be
completely known. But it can almost certainly be traced to the
military's ill-advised decision last spring to send soldiers and
militants into Indian territory to take up positions in the
mountains of the disputed region of Kashmir. Indian artillery and
air attacks pushed the invaders back, and the United States
intervened to get Sharif to agree to their withdrawal. Pakistan's
generals were angry at the retreat, even though Sharif got a
commitment from President Clinton to take more of an interest in
the Kashmir conflict. Word spread in Pakistan that Sharif had sold
out his nation.
</P>
<P>
   The discontent with Sharif has led to rumors of a coup in the
last few weeks, but the generals acted only after the prime
minister tried to oust his chief of staff. Clinton administration
officials are suggesting that they tried to warn Sharif not to
overplay his hand, but that the advice was rejected. The United
States does not have much leverage with which to press Pakistan to
return to civilian government. Economic and military relations were
already frozen after Pakistan exploded a nuclear bomb last year,
although a few sanctions were eased by the World Bank and
International Monetary Fund when Sharif took steps to defuse
tensions with India.
</P>
<P>
   Because of Pakistan's history as a ``front-line state'' against
the former Soviet Union, the United States has maintained
relationships with Pakistani generals. Washington must now work
with two other important Pakistani allies, China and Saudi Arabia,
to see that the generals do not even consider trying to solve their
problems with India by military force. They must be made to
understand that the only way Pakistan can win international support
for its conflicts with India is by adhering to its civilian
tradition. In India, Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee has won

FIGHT IS PROMISED OVER GM PLAN TO BUY DEALERSHIPS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ The president of the National Automobile Dealers
Association, one of the nation's wealthiest and most powerful
business lobbying groups, on Tuesday bitterly criticized General
Motors Corp. for its plan to buy 5 percent to 10 percent of its
dealerships and operate them itself. He hinted that dealers might
try to use their political influence to stop the company.
</P>
<P>
   The criticism set the stage not only for a fight over how
automobiles are sold in the United States but also over the
development of electronic commerce and the Internet. GM and other
automakers have been trying to market vehicles over the Internet,
but dealers have been blocking many of those initiatives, using
state franchise laws that require that all vehicles be sold through
dealerships.
</P>
<P>
   GM could get around those laws by owning dealerships. The
company's policies are important because of GM's size. Optimistic
predictions of sales to consumers over the Internet by all
industries run as high as $100 billion in 2003; GM alone already
sells that much in automobiles each year in North America, so
Internet commerce could grow much faster if it included direct
sales to consumers by automakers.
</P>
<P>
   James Willingham, the president of the dealers association, said
he and other dealers planned to meet Wednesday with GM chairman and
chief executive John Smith to ask him to abandon or significantly
modify the plan to buy dealerships, which was announced Sept. 28.
``It's an unprecedented attack on the dealer franchise system,''
Willingham said in a speech at an Automotive Press Association
luncheon in Detroit on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   If Smith refuses to back down, the nation's auto dealers will
consider several possible responses, including an attempt to win
state or federal legislation blocking GM's plans, Willingham said.
He noted that there was an average of 52 new-car dealers in the
district of each United States representative.``Some dealers went
to school with that guy,'' he added, ``or worked on his campaign,
so we have some grass-roots clout and we're going to use it.''
</P>
<P>
   GM spokesman Terry Sullivan declined to respond to the specifics
of Willingham's remarks but noted that the automaker planned to buy
only a minority of its dealerships. ``We're indicating 5 to 10
percent _ that means another 90 percent out there'' will remain
independent, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But GM has also said that it is most interested in buying large
dealerships in the nation's 130 largest metropolitan areas over the
next decade. Because a fifth of the nation's dealerships account
for four-fifths of the vehicles sold, GM could end up selling a
huge number of vehicles itself. GM has about 7,700 dealerships in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Dealers have traditionally beaten automakers in political
showdowns because of the dealers' presence in every congressional
district, and in practically every state lawmaker's district, too.
</P>
<P>
   Ford has experimented with buying stakes in dealerships in five
midsize cities, starting in Tulsa, Okla., late last year. Dealers
have already responded by persuading state legislatures in Texas,
Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Georgia, North Carolina and Montana to
pass legislation this year tightening state laws against
automakers' ownership of dealerships. GM officials have not
disclosed how, if at all, they plan to get around these laws.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ford decided in late September to temporarily halt dealership
acquisitions while reviewing its strategy. Willingham said Tuesday
that Ford's approach bothered him less than GM's because Ford is
taking minority stakes in dealerships, leaving dealers in control,
while GM plans to buy them outright.
</P>
<P>
   GM and Ford have insisted that they will not favor factory-owned
dealerships, but Willingham questioned whether impartial treatment
was possible. ``If there are two babies crying, one of them is
yours, which are you going to pick up?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler AG and foreign automakers are trying a different
strategy of working more closely with their dealers. Many dealers
these days have franchises from several automakers and can steer
customers to favored brands, making it difficult for automakers to
change dealership policies.
</P>
<P>
   Willingham, a Buick dealer in California for 39 years and the
owner of dealerships that sell seven other brands of automobiles,
said that with auto sales at their highest level ever in the 1999
model year, the current dealership system must be working. Citing a
recent survey paid for by dealers that showed high customer
satisfaction with dealerships, he said that, ``We're kind of
asking, if it ain't broke, why mess with it?''  &QL;

WILT WOULD HAVE LOVED ALL THE ATTENTION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LeBRETON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Wilt Chamberlain was a giant of a man whose ego, libido and
footprint on the NBA could not be measured.
</P>
<P>
   According to Chamberlain, there might have been 20,000 women,
but only one Wilt.
</P>
<P>
   He died Tuesday in Bel Air, Calif., at age 63 from what
authorities speculate was an apparent heart attack. The feeling
here is that it would have pleased Wilt that today his picture is
in all the papers.
</P>
<P>
   I interviewed him once, too long ago to remember exactly when.
Actually I stood there in a group, tucked in a hallway just off the
basketball floor at the Great Western Forum, and I scribbled while
Chamberlain spoke.
</P>
<P>
   As I recall, Wilt was pontificating about his favorite subject _
namely, that he was the best basketball player alive. Even though
he was in his 40s and had retired probably 10 years prior.
</P>
<P>
   But in some ways, he was right. Coming out of the University of
Kansas, Chamberlain had singlehandedly pushed the NBA into a new
generation by being both undeniably tall and richly athletic. He
could run and he could jump. He supposedly taught himself tennis
and became the darling of the Hollywood doubles scene. He took up
volleyball and became one of the country's best.
</P>
<P>
   Pro basketball was different in the 1960s, when the Chamberlain
legend first grew larger than life. The 24-second clock had
unleashed a nightly assault on the basket. The notion of somebody
averaging 50 points per night, as Wilt did in 1961-62, seems a tall
tale in this day of hip-check defenses and eight 7-footers crashing
the boards.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, the feat was yawned at. Chamberlain's numbers were so
prolific, they trivialized themselves. I have no memory of even his
extraordinary 100-point game on March 2, 1962 making the front page
of my hometown's sports section.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's what puffed up Wilt Chamberlain, prompted him to
write about his sexual exploits and regularly try to keep the
modern NBA in its place. Maybe he was simply trying to protect his
own legend, as if all of the points and all of the rebounds had
been deemed frivolous by their volume.
</P>
<P>
   He was wrong, of course. As time grew, so did the basketball
legend of Wilt Chamberlain.
</P>
<P>
   He left Kansas one year early and in that one grand tour, Wilt
became the most gifted Harlem Globetrotter who ever played. Long
before Michael Jordan brought his dominating personal style to the
game, Wilt took the NBA firmly by the neck. In a game against the
Boston Celtics in 1960, Chamberlain pulled down 55 rebounds. Seven
seasons later, presumably just because he wanted to, Wilt led the
league in assists.
</P>
<P>
   Denver coach Dan Issel said Tuesday, ``As I grew up, Wilt the
Stilt was the player _ just the things he was able to do. I guess
one year they told him he couldn't make as much money as he wanted
because he couldn't pass the ball, so he went out and led the
league in assists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Watching Wilt, you always kind of got the idea he was just
playing with people. That he was on cruise control and still 10
times better than anybody else that was playing at that time.''
</P>
<P>
   It bothered Chamberlain, it was widely written, that though he
won two NBA championships, he carried the label of The Guy Who
Couldn't Beat Bill Russell. In truth, they were two distinct types
of players _ Russell being the ultimate team player on the ultimate
team, and Chamberlain forced to shoulder his teams' loads.
</P>
<P>
   In today's game, Wilt would have been the wealthiest player in
the game. Russell would be paid like Scottie Pippen.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Chamberlain ever seemed to hurt for money. He benefited
richly by playing for the Lakers as they burst into trendy
prominence in Los Angeles. Hollywood stars embraced him. Wilt
became a regular at the Playboy mansion.
</P>
<P>
   In the course of his memoirs, his autobiography ``A View From
Above,'' Wilt ventured the opinion that he had had sex with 20,000
different women. As usual, Chamberlain's numbers betrayed him. The
remark became a running TV joke. On the David Letterman show, the
gag one night involved a makeshift ``Wilt-O-Meter'' that resembled
a running odometer.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, it was hard to take Chamberlain seriously about a
lot of things. His life, as well as his career, seemed almost too
large.
</P>
<P>
   Today, no doubt, some will remember him in print as perhaps the
greatest NBA player ever, which he probably was (forgive me,
Michael Jordan). Most of all, Wilt's picture is back in all the
papers.
</P>
<P>
   He would have liked that.

ADVERTISING: AT ANNUAL MEETING, BIG MARKETERS FOCUS ON E-BUSINESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By STUART ELLIOTT   C.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMELIA ISLAND, Fla. _ Begging your pardon, Irving Berlin. The
contention of the closing general session of the 1999 annual
conference of the Association of National Advertisers was that
there's no business like e-business.
</P>
<P>
   E-business _ as in electronic commerce, interactive advertising,
electronic retailing, the new media and online marketing _ was the
sole focus of the concluding session of the conference Tuesday at
the Ritz-Carlton Hotel here. The session, lasting more than three
and a half hours, was notable for two reasons.
</P>
<P>
   One was that, according to those attending who work for
interactive advertising agencies, the audience of large national
advertisers seemed completely comfortable with the technical
terminology that the speakers used, everything from ``streaming
media'' and ``channel conflict'' to ``data mining'' and
``first-mover advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   The second was that the session included no sponsored segments,
unlike the general sessions Sunday and Monday. The sponsorships,
bought by the Conde Nast Publications unit of Advance Publications,
and five national radio networks, drew complaints from many
attendees for huckster-like sales pitches from the stage.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the media sponsorships _ unique among ad industry
annual conferences _ were the inspiration for jokes during an
awards dinner Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here we are, sponsors,'' said Myer Berlow, president for
interactive marketing at America Online Inc., whose company
co-sponsored the awards with the trade publication Advertising Age,
``and we don't have a commercial.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was great to hear Rush Limbaugh talk about something he
knew about,'' Berlow continued, referring to the talk show host's
speech during the presentation sponsored by the radio networks,
``his rate card.''
</P>
<P>
   How e-business rates with advertisers proved to be compelling
content at the closing general session, which had as its moderator
a newly minted ``e-trepreneur'': Lou Dobbs, the former CNN business
news anchor who is chairman and chief executive of a fledgling Web
site company, Space.com.
</P>
<P>
   Dobbs should not worry about his enterprise, according to the
opening speaker, Robert Herbold, executive vice president and chief
operating officer of Microsoft Corp., because ``aggressive
newcomers have created the buzz'' in e-business while ``incumbency
has never been worth less.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason, Herbold said, is that the goal of many new
e-commerce sites is ``to `clean up the value chain' and get it
direct from the source to the consumer.'' He cited Proflowers.com,
which ships products to customers not from florist shops but from
growers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Web is a distribution system, a medium and a
marketplace,'' Herbold said, adding that Internet advertising will
``become absolutely gargantuan'' and far more creative than it is
now.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, he suggested that marketers selling packaged-goods
products of ``low interest'' to consumers could ``revisit the
marketing of the '40s and '50s when brands were sponsors of
something important to people'' and ``become sponsors of Web sites
with information of value.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Beindorf, chief operating officer of Planetrx.com, an
online drugstore, offered rules to ``contend with the `futurity' of
what is already happening today'' in E-business.
</P>
<P>
   While ``brands continue to matter,'' Beindorf said, ``you will
have to move much faster'' to ``put a stake in the ground and
create a positioning'' that will differentiate brands from one
another in the minds of computer users, a benefit he described as
the ``first-mover advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   The ability to measure sales more quickly and more precisely
with online advertising means that ``marketers will become
accountable for expenditures and results,'' Beindorf said, ``maybe
for the first time.''
</P>
<P>
   Accountability was the subject of a panel on channel conflict,
though not the kind facing viewers torn between watching ``Will and
Grace'' or ``Dharma and Greg.'' Rather, the term refers to the
problems confronted by marketers whose products can be sold online
as well as by brick-and-mortar retailers, who may resent the
powerful new competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``For 95 percent of our products, it doesn't make sense'' to
sell ``directly to the consumer,'' Vivienne Bechtold, interactive
marketing director at the Procter &AMP; Gamble Co., said. ``But certain
products that go to specific targets, like Pampers Preemie and
coffees, there's an opportunity to sell them maybe more effectively
online, maybe through a retailer.''
</P>
<P>
   P&AMP;G is planning to start a Web site, Reflect.com, that will sell
customized beauty products directly to consumers. ``We'll be using
online media and offline media to drive online awareness'' of the
site, Ms. Bechtold said.
</P>
<P>
   At First Union Corp., which signed the millionth user of its
financial Web site Oct. 1, ``we're getting away from the
mass-marketing mindset of `one size fits all,''' said James
Garrity, senior vice president for marketing. Instead, he said, the
company is embracing ``tailored solutions differentiating consumers
based on who are our most loyal, profitable customers.''
</P>
<P>
   And Ford Motor Co. is grappling with the ``huge impact'' of
``disintermediaries,'' independent Web sites that act as sales
channels for new and used vehicles, according to David Ropes,
Ford's director for corporate advertising and integrated marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Ford is ``spending $20 million in retraining our dealers,'' he
said, ``getting connected not only through their own Web sites but
through the main company site.'' By the end of the year, he added,
85 percent of Ford's dealers will be online.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   There was also business without an ``e'' prefix at the
conference.
</P>
<P>
   The advertiser association formally mothballed a much-disputed
proposal, made at the annual conference last year, to invite
advertising agencies to join as members. The proposal drew
castigation from officials of the agency trade group, the American
Association of Advertising Agencies.
</P>
<P>
   John Sarsen, president and chief executive of the advertiser
association, and O. Burtch Drake, president and chief executive of
the agency association, said separately that officials of both
groups would meet sometime early next year to discuss cooperation
on two long-divisive issues: How marketers review advertising
accounts and the ways marketers compensate their agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone's happy with that,'' Drake said.
</P>
<P>
   And attendees breathed a loud sigh of relief as the conference,
which began Saturday afternoon, ended last night. When the
advertiser association held its annual conference here in October
1996, a rare Florida northeaster washed out all outdoor activities,
confining attendees inside. This time, by contrast, the weather was
as sunny as, well, the outlook for e-business.  &QL;

<HEADLINE>
EDITORIAL: HOLDING UP THE GUN MAKERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, Oct. 13:
</P>
<P>
   It is too early to say whether the settlement talks between
leading gun manufacturers and the cities that are suing them will
be an important turning point in the battle to improve gun safety
and stem the flow of weapons to juveniles and criminals. What seems
obvious, however, is that it was not sudden pangs of conscience
that led companies like Smith &AMP; Wesson, Colt's Manufacturing, Glock
and Beretta to decide to pursue these negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, their new willingness to talk stems in large measure
from lawsuits that seek to hold the manufacturers liable for
negligent marketing practices that allow guns to fall into the
wrong hands, and for making their products ``unreasonably
dangerous'' by failing to incorporate safety devices to prevent the
weapons' unauthorized use. Some of these cases are now reaching the
discovery phase, when the plaintiffs may well uncover damaging
corporate documents of the kind that played such a critical role in
the tobacco litigation.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, a California appeals court has recently reinstated
a lawsuit against the maker of semiautomatic pistols used to kill
eight people in 1993. This was the first ruling by an appeals court
to allow a gun maker to be held responsible for a criminal
shooting. The attorneys general of New York, Eliot Spitzer, and
Connecticut, Richard Blumenthal, gave the companies another
incentive to talk by threatening to file the first state lawsuits
against them.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, pressure from the gun lawsuits may well have been a
factor in a recent decision by Colt's, the producer of the storied
Colt .45, to sharply cut back its consumer-handgun business. The
company has tried to downplay the significance of the move. But
according to a senior company executive quoted in The New York
Times on Monday, the 144-year-old company _ already in some
financial trouble _ had found it increasingly difficult to finance
its operations because lenders were afraid that the lawsuits could
produce crippling judgments, impairing Colt's ability to repay.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiations center on demands submitted to the gun makers
by Los Angeles City Attorney Jim Hahn. . His proposals would bring
useful, common-sense changes to the gun trade that Congress refuses
to entertain, much less approve. He and his colleagues want every
gun personalized so that only its owner can fire it _ a technology
that Colt's has helped advance. He also wants the companies to
supply only those retailers who agree to limit customers to one
handgun purchase a month, to stop selling handguns at gun shows and
on the Internet and to halt advertisements asserting that handguns
enhance home safety.
</P>
<P>
   The companies that make most of the cheap handguns used by
criminals are not attending the talks. As Spitzer notes, however,
nothing forecloses state and municipal litigation against these
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Even with a settlement between the cities and the gun companies,
Congress would still need to pass a sensible system of gun
registration and licensing.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, it is too early to say if the gun makers are
negotiating in good faith or merely stalling for time. But Spitzer
and his colleagues need to keep in mind that they are in a strong
position. With tough bargaining, they could force the gun makers to
adopt safety measures they and the National Rifle Association have
long resisted.

ROGERS BATTLING THROUGH POSTSEASON WOES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The postseason struggles of New York Mets left-hander
Kenny Rogers remain unexplained.
</P>
<P>
   Theories abound, but none should question the pitcher's
intestinal fortitude, Mets manager Bobby Valentine said Tuesday
before Game 1 of this National League Championship Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``His makeup is fine. What he needs is his pitches,'' said
Valentine, who plans to start Rogers against the Braves this
afternoon in Game 2 at Turner Field in Atlanta. ``I think he'll
have his pitches.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogers must or can expect to hear more questions regarding his
inability to perform during October.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to prepare the same way,'' said Rogers, who is 0-1
with an 11.92 earned-run average for his five postseason
appearances. ``Like I said, I'm going to take this game just like
it's a regular-season game because that's the way I think I'll be
most successful.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you get caught up in all of the other distractions and the
magnitude of it, it will take your focus away from what you want to
do out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogers took the loss during the Mets' lone blemish in their
best-of-five Division Series against the Arizona Diamondbacks.
Rogers surrendered four runs on five hits and two walks during the
Mets' 7-1 loss in Game 2 before being replaced by right-hander Pat
Mahomes after 41/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers, though, is not alone in his pursuit of postseason
excellence. Yankees right-hander Roger Clemens and Braves
right-hander Greg Maddux have endured similar questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to know that guys of that caliber can go out there
and struggle once in awhile, too,'' Rogers said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Rogers could carry a slight edge to the mound for this
afternoon's start. Rogers, whom the Mets acquired July 23 from the
Athletics, did not pitch against the Braves this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he makes his pitches, it will be a definite advantage,''
Valentine said. ``There might be an at-bat or two that he gets away
with because they don't know how sharp his breaking ball is or
don't realize he pitches inside or what kind of sink he has on his
fastball or changeup.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope it's a distinct advantage,'' Rogers said. ``I'll take
any advantage I can get, but good hitters are going to hit good
pitches sometimes. So, you have to just keep continually making
good pitches against their hitters.'' nn

MERCKER GETS GAME 1 START FOR BOSTON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Left-hander Kent Mercker, who pitched only 1 2/3
innings against the Cleveland Indians in Game 4 of the Division
Series on Sunday, was named by Red Sox manager Jimy Williams as the
starting pitcher for Game 1. Orlando Hernandez will pitch for the
Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Mercker, who missed two weeks in September with a strained
ribcage, allowed two runs on three hits and three walks Sunday
before being yanked.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just felt he was the right one to start this particular
game,'' Williams said. ``Maybe \RSunday\S was more of a side
session for him. His command wasn't what it should be. Hopefully,
he'll locate the ball better and get out in front of hitters
better.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox's choices were limited. Bret Saberhagen and Pedro
Martinez both pitched Monday, and Ramon Martinez, who will start
Game 2, went 52/3 innings Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Knuckleballer Tim Wakefield was considered another candidate,
but both he and John Wasdin were dropped from the roster for Pat
Rapp and Bryce Florie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I get the start by default,'' Mercker said. ``I'm
looking forward to it. But I don't think Jimy did it out of
necessity because nobody else could pitch. I think he has
confidence in me.''
Clemens vs. Martinez Both managers announced their rotations for
the first four games of the series. Boston's Ramon Martinez will
face David Cone in Game 2, but the big matchup everybody is looking
forward to is Game 3 between Pedro Martinez for the Red Sox and
Roger Clemens for the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens pitched with the Red Sox from 1984-96 before leaving as
a free agent. He won three of his five Cy Young Awards while with
the Red Sox. Martinez won the National League Cy Young Award in
1997 while with Montreal, and a record of 23-4 with a 2.40 ERA
makes him a lock to win it this year in the AL.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a lot of fun,'' Yankees manager Joe Torre
said. ``Obviously, what Roger has meant to that organization and
that ballpark for a number of years and of course what Pedro has
done this year, it ought to be interesting.'' Hunter family honored
Helen Hunter, widow of Hall of Fame pitcher Jim ``Catfish'' Hunter,
and his children Todd, Paul and Kim Hunter-Layne, are scheduled to
throw out the ceremonial first pitch for Game 1 tonight. This is
the family's first appearance since Hunter died of amyotrophic
lateral sclerosis (Lou Gehrig's disease) on Sept. 9. Davis on
Martinez Red Sox ace Pedro Martinez is considered the best pitcher
in baseball, but Yankees designated hitter Chili Davis isn't
exactly in awe of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't get impressed with much,'' Davis said. ``I give my
respect to Pedro, but I'm not impressed. I faced guys like Nolan
\RRyan\S and Dwight \RGooden\S in their prime, and they were just
as good.'' O'Neill expected to play Yankees right fielder Paul
O'Neill said he expects to play tonight even though he's suffering
from a broken rib in his right side.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's better today obviously than it was a few days ago,''
O'Neill said after the Yankees' workout yesterday. ``I went through
everything today, and I'm looking forward to playing. Unless I wake
up and have a big setback, then everything is a go at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill injured himself running into a wall at Tropicana Field
in Tampa Bay, Fla., on the final Saturday of the season. He played
in the first two games against the Rangers but sat out Game 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm worried about how I feel, instead of playing, then I
shouldn't be out there,'' O'Neill said. ``Right now I went out,
went through everything and felt pretty good.''

METS' PIAZZA SET FOR RETURN

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Mets regained the services of catcher Mike Piazza
for Game 1 of the National League Championship Series.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Bobby Valentine learned before noon that Piazza's
swollen left thumb would not prevent his catcher from playing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was even a little better than it was \RMonday\S, and
\RMonday\S was good enough to play,'' Valentine said.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza did not play during the Mets' final two victories against
the Diamondbacks in the Division Series. Piazza's replacement, Todd
Pratt, hit the 10th-inning, game-winning home run in Game 4 that
eliminated the Diamondbacks. Weiss in, Hernandez out Braves
shortstop Jose Hernandez struggled offensively against the Astros
during the Division Series, so manager Bobby Cox turned to veteran
Walt Weiss for Game 1 of the NLCS.
</P>
<P>
   Weiss emerged as one of the heroes of the Division Series with
his diving stop of Tony Eusebio's 10th-inning ground ball in Game
3. That helped the Braves escape a bases-loaded jam unscathed, and
Atlanta went on to win that contest, 5-3, in 12 innings. Weiss also
appears more comfortable at the plate through his work with hitting
coach Don Baylor.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looked good down in Houston when he came in, and Don's got
him swinging a lot better right now,'' Cox said. ``He's a great
defensive shortstop, and I thought I'd go that way for tonight's
game anyway.'' Baylor, Cubs meet The Cubs interviewed Baylor for
their vacant managerial position Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Baylor met with Cubs general manager Ed Lynch and president Andy
MacPhail for three hours after the Braves' workout. Baylor
interviewed with the Angels three weeks ago, but that was before
the resignation of general manager Bill Bavasi.
</P>
<P>
   The Brewers have also contacted Baylor, but he has not been
interviewed for their managerial opening. Cox takes high road Bobby
Valentine suggested this week that the Mets do not receive the
proper respect from the Braves. Bobby Cox, though, attempted to
downplay the animosity between the two ballclubs.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got a real classy ballclub over there,'' Cox said. ``I
like a lot of their guys. There's always a few players in the
league that you would rather not have on your team, but I couldn't
name you one on that team.'' Cox wants best-of-seven It would mean
the reduction of the regular season's 162-game schedule, but Cox
prefers that the Division Series be expanded to a best-of-seven
format like the LCS and World Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't think you play all year long to get knocked out
in three games,'' Cox said. ``It's not quite fair \Rto someone\S
like Texas.'' He said it ``Well, speaking from experience ... I
haven't had any, so I'm not sure.''

SPORTS COLUMN: METS STILL CAN'T GET IT RIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ They were caught in an apparently fatal tail spin only
three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   They were shunted by Major League Baseball to the late, late
show to satisfy an arriviste franchise out west.
</P>
<P>
   They have been denigrated by their manager as not among the
brightest of humankind.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Bizarre If Not Amazing Mets have returned to where the
craziness all began, but with the same depressing results for the
New Yorkers. On Tuesday night, Greg Maddux and the bullpen stopped
the Mets, 4-2, in the first game of the National League
championship series.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets were back in Turner Field, insisting that they are not
the same becalmed outfit that lost three straight to the Braves
here, then three straight in Philadelphia, then two of three to the
Braves in New York. Some of the Mets have acted as if those numbers
were invented, but in fact they actually happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``They play great against us in their own stadium,'' said
Edgardo Alfonzo of the Mets. ``It's tough after a loss, but
tomorrow's another day.''
</P>
<P>
   Another day, and a 4 p.m. game at that. The Mets did not get
respect from baseball, which put their first two games on at 11
p.m., beyond the reach of younger fans. Commissioner Bud Selig
confided on Tuesday night that his very own wife, Sue Selig,
criticized the decision to play so late. With any luck, the Commish
will remember it next year.
</P>
<P>
   For all that, baseball has lucked out again, with East Coast
teams, four storied franchises with great angles no matter who
wins. Atlanta-Boston? There are old curmudgeons up in Boston who
haven't gone to a game since the Braves left town. They would go
out and cheer Chipper Jones as if he were Bob Elliott reincarnated.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Mets, so much has happened to them since their slump
that it almost seems like another age. The manager has had his mood
swings _ often within seconds of each other _ from fatalistic to
antagonistic to grandiose. The players have failed in the clutch
and performed in the clutch. And still, the Mets are with us.
</P>
<P>
   Did the Braves' superiority have any carryover in this series?
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, I hope none of that comes into play,'' Bobby
Valentine said on Tuesday night. ``But it's probably some factor
there that you have to factor in. I heard Joe Torre said, `You're
supposed to rip up what happened in the past once you get to these
playoffs.' I like that statement a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   There was also the baseball fact of life that good pitching
stops good hitting, as proven by the way Pedro Martinez of Boston
shut down the slugging Indians when he materialized in the middle
of another slugfest in the deciding American League game Monday
night.
</P>
<P>
   At the risk of sounding like Mr. McGuire in the movie ``The
Graduate,'' who pompously intoned that the future lay in plastics,
one could solemnly state that the future of any given playoff
series lies in pitching. The high level of
Maddux-Millwood-Glavine-Smoltz could shut down a hot streak in a
hurry.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly Maddux boggled the Mets for seven innings and also
fielded his position. A cheerfully bland sort, he was asked if this
victory gave the Braves a huge psychological advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nah,'' he said. ``It's a seven-game series.''
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the Braves said the same thing. They sounded
respectful of the Mets, even though Valentine has had it both ways,
saying the Braves do not respect the Mets, then noting that the
Braves have no need to respect the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   This is essentially silly business because ``respect'' is really
something out of the contact sports, the kind of thing Pat Riley or
Bill Parcells would tell their troops to inspire them to throw
their bodies around.
</P>
<P>
   The players are all in the same union, and it shows. The hang
around the batting cage and chat with each other _ and why not?
They could be changing sides, voluntarily, in the next year or two,
so why antagonize a future teammate or a current lodge member?
</P>
<P>
   Valentine's acerbic comments may reflect the tensions he
generates. Other players and managers tend to get huffy when he is
mentioned, so he broadens it into a general condition.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a joke, a joke, the lack-of-respect angle,'' Bobby Cox,
the Braves' manager, said Monday. ``I don't know where that came
from. They've got our respect. They have a lot of good players on
that team and they're good guys. I like them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets have survived their low moments. But here they are,
still trying to win back some of the perceived loss of respect,
external or maybe even internal.

EDITORIAL: THE 6 BILLION MARK 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, Oct. 13:
</P>
<P>
   The world's population reached 6 billion this week, by United
Nations estimates. The news is daunting, given that the figure has
doubled since 1960. Yet 6 billion actually represents significant
progress made in the past 30 years in reducing birth rates,
improving health care and giving women greater access to education
and economic opportunities. Without such modernization, population
growth would have been higher than it is now.
</P>
<P>
   In a single generation, fertility rates have declined in
virtually every nation. Industrialized countries have seen
birthrates fall from 2.8 children per woman in the 1950s to roughly
1.6 today. In the developing world, birthrates have dropped from
6.2 children per woman to slightly less than 3. Over the next
several decades the world's population will continue to grow, but
more slowly, reaching 8.9 billion in 2050, and stabilizing at about
10 billion in 2200.
</P>
<P>
   This scenario is a far cry from the dire predictions about the
population explosion commonly made in the 1960s. Even so,
population growth will occur mostly in the poorest nations that are
least prepared to deal with worsening population pressures on the
environment, water supply, food production and social
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   One of the great lessons learned in the past three decades is
that controlling population growth is inextricably tied to
development strategies that improve gender equity, expand education
for women, increase access to reproductive health care and give
women more economic power. All these factors help enable women to
choose to have smaller, healthier families.
</P>
<P>
   The 1994 International Conference on Population and Development
in Cairo set a broad agenda focused on these objectives, which were
agreed to by 179 countries. Many nations are now trying to put
these population development goals into practice. But financial
support from the industrialized nations has been lacking.
</P>
<P>
   The Cairo Conference estimated that $17 billion would be needed
annually for population and health activities, with about
two-thirds coming from the developing countries themselves and
one-third from international donors. But total funding from
international donors in 1997 was less than $2 billion, far short of
the goal. The United States remains the leading donor in family
planning programs, but its support has been declining in recent
years. Anti-abortion rhetoric continues to be used in Congress to
limit aid for international family planning programs.
</P>
<P>
   The challenges facing developing nations are enormous. Even now,
nearly 600,000 women die annually during pregnancy, more than 350
million women do not have access to a range of effective
contraceptive methods, and 600 million women cannot read or write.
These conditions remain big obstacles in achieving population
stabilization. Unless international funding increases, the next
billion people may be consigned to lives of privation in countries
where resources are already stretched to the limit.

WILT, KAREEM RIVALRY STRAINED OVER TIME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By VINCENT BONSIGNORE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It was an odd relationship _ filled with times of
great friendship and also long periods of animosity.
</P>
<P>
   The strange bond between Wilt Chamberlain and Kareem
Abdul-Jabbar is, and always will be, hard to understand, surpassing
in puzzlement the fragile relationship between Chamberlain and Bill
Russell.
</P>
<P>
   After all, Russell and Chamberlain were contemporaries, rivals
who consistently played against each other in the NBA Finals. It
was inevitable their bond would be strained.
</P>
<P>
   The Chamberlain-and-Abdul-Jabbar feud was more confusing. They
played against each other only four years. In addition, it was
Chamberlain, then an NBA superstar, who befriended Abdul-Jabbar
when he was a high school star in New York City. For a time, he was
Kareem's mentor.
</P>
<P>
   The animosity came mostly from Chamberlain, who spent a lot of
time sniping at Abdul-Jabbar in the press once Kareem turned
professional.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, long after Chamberlain retired, he belittled
Abdul-Jabbar's rebounding, and even urged him to retire a few
times. He summed up those feelings in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel sorry for Kareem,'' Chamberlain said. ``One thing for
sure _ he was blessed with a magnificent body and magnificent
talent. Not to say he loafed, but he never pushed himself to the
limit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not here to chastise Kareem. He was the greatest offensive
force I ever faced on the basketball court _ by far. The only time
I ever saw him push himself was against me.''
</P>
<P>
   During his career, Abdul-Jabbar stayed above the fray. But he
did respond in his post-career book, ``My Turn,'' published in
1990.
</P>
<P>
   In a segment sub-titled ``An Open Letter to Wilt Chumberlame,''
Abdul-Jabbar lashed out at the man he once idolized.
</P>
<P>
   He ended the letter by writing: ``So, now that I have left, one
thing will be part of my legacy: People will remember that I worked
with my teammates and helped us win. You will be remembered as a
whining crybaby and a quitter, stats and all.''
</P>
<P>
   Abdul-Jabbar later said he wrote the letter against the wishes
of the book's publisher.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the one who wanted to do it,'' Abdul-Jabbar said. ``As a
matter of fact, Mignon (McCarthy, the co-author) said, `Don't do
it, don't do it, it's like getting into a mud-slinging contest.' I
told her I was already covered with mud....
</P>
<P>
   ``Wilt had his say for a long time, and I've never really
responded to it, never told my side of it. I just figured I'd have
some fun with it.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Abdul-Jabbar released this statement: ``Wilt was one
of the greatest players ever, and we will never see another one
like him.''

BEFORE TODAY'S STARS, CHAMBERLAIN LED THE WAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The only thing small about Wilt Chamberlain was
the audience he reached. Because he came into his own long before
cable-TV sports came of age, there actually are people who call
themselves rabid NBA fans who will tell you with a straight face
that Kareem Abdul Jabbar or Patrick Ewing or _ God forbid _
Shaquille O'Neal redefined the center position.
</P>
<P>
   These people ought to be convicted of blasphemy and sentenced to
13 months of studying grainy basketball films from the 1960s and
early 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   It's a shame the image of the silky 7-foot-1 Chamberlain
blocking a shot or leading the fast break or finger-rolling the
ball into the basket isn't as easily retrieved from the mind's
archives as Michael Jordan's wagging tongue or fadeaway jumper.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, Chamberlain, who was found dead in his Bel-Air
home Tuesday, revolutionized the game as surely as did Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of his death at age 63 is sadly ironic, coming the
day before the Los Angeles Lakers were to open their exhibition
season and unveil the same triangle offense that showcased
Chamberlain's array of skills and cemented his legacy.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the posies and platitudes stands O'Neal, who is in the
best position to honor Chamberlain's memory. The 7-foot-1 center
can pay homage to the Hall of Famer by losing himself in the
triangle offense and leading his team to the NBA title this season,
his eighth in the league, same as Chamberlain.
</P>
<P>
   After all, imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.
</P>
<P>
   Chamberlain, who played the final five years of his career in
L.A., and Celtics center Bill Russell were the Magic Johnson and
Larry Bird of their day. Their rivalry was the thrust that elevated
not only their individual games but lifted the league into a
different stratosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Russell and Chamberlain challenged the casting of the center as
a sort of human glacier, in the middle of the action but not
central to it.
</P>
<P>
   They weren't plodding, they weren't loggerheads, they didn't
move as though they had escaped from Baron von Frankenstein's
laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   In one game, Chamberlain used his 50-inch vertical leap to block
the first 10 shots taken by Walt Bellamy, himself no slouch. In
another he scored 100 points, a total most teams in the league
today can't muster.
</P>
<P>
   Chamberlain averaged 50.4 points his third year in the league
and led the league in assists in his ninth, averaging 8.6 a game.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1959 and 1973, he won 11 rebounding titles. In five of
those seasons, he also captured the scoring title, a double-double
nobody has done since.
</P>
<P>
   Chamberlain was as multi-faceted as a diamond. His value
extended well beyond scoring, though those 118 games of 50-or-more
points had a way of blinding people.
</P>
<P>
   In 1966-67, Philadelphia coach Alex Hannum _ a college teammate
of Tex Winter's at USC _ installed a triple-post offense he had
borrowed from Trojans coach Sam Barry. It wasn't easy but Hannum
managed to convince Chamberlain his rebounding and passing _ even
more than his prodigious scoring _ were paramount to the system's
success.
</P>
<P>
   Chamberlain, tired of getting beaten up by the critics who
derided him as a big basketball player but not a great one, placed
his ego in Hannum's hands. He didn't lead the NBA in scoring that
season but finished tops in the league in rebounding and shooting
percentage and was third in assists.
</P>
<P>
   More significantly, Philadelphia finished second to none. Where
there was Wilt there was a way; Philadelphia defeated San Francisco
in six games in the NBA Finals and Chamberlain shed the loser label
that, he later wrote, had ``stuck on me like some big, ugly scar
from an operation I never had.''
</P>
<P>
   Chamberlain again subjugated his scoring for the good of the
team in 1971-72. Bill Sharman, the Lakers' coach, also had been
weaned on basketball, Sam Barry style, and so it was Chamberlain
concentrated on his rebounding and passing and left the scoring
largely to guards Gail Goodrich and Jerry West.
</P>
<P>
   Goodrich led the Lakers in scoring that season, averaging 25.9
points. Chamberlain averaged 19.2 rebounds and 14.8 points.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-seven years later Chamberlain is gone. But there's no
reason his example can't live on.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers have two proven scorers in Kobe Bryant and Glen Rice.
They've got a big man with more scoring titles than NBA
championship rings.
</P>
<P>
   If O'Neal commits to passing, rebounding and shot-blocking it
could be yesterday once more. And wouldn't that be a eulogy worth
waiting for?

<P>
   Tommy Heinsohn remembered when he purposely threw a basketball
off the backboard because he was convinced Wilt Chamberlain would
block his shot.
</P>
<P>
   Willis Reed was happy to have been outscored by Chamberlain by
56-32 in their first encounter.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would have doubled my points if he made his free throws,''
Reed joked.
</P>
<P>
   Red Auerbach called him ``a giant of giants,'' and affectionatly
remembered their first meeting. ``He was an 18-year-old bellhop at
the Kutsher's Country Club in Monticello, N.Y.,'' the Celtics'
patriarch said. ``You could tell even then he was headed toward 7
feet tall and greatness.''
</P>
<P>
   The day Chamberlain died at his Bel Air, Calif., home at age 63,
the people who played with and against the game's most indomitable
center remembered him.
</P>
<P>
   Heinsohn, the former Celtic who played and coached against
Chamberlain, last saw him in May during a tribute to Bill Russell
in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went out till 3 in the morning and told war stories,''
Heinsohn said. ``I told him that he took a handful of my jersey and
ripped it out his rookie year.''
</P>
<P>
   Heinsohn added: ``Wilt brought two things to the NBA. First of
all, because of Wilt Chamberlain, people started thinking of
basketball players as the world's greatest athletes. Before him,
you supposedly played the game because you were tall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Also, he was such a dominating individual. And yet, he showed
basketball was a team sport, that the talent around you meant more.
He helped create the Boston Celtics. In turn those two elements
helped create the NBA.''
</P>
<P>
   Billy Cunningham, a teammate of Chamberlain's for three seasons
in Philadelphia, was stunned by the news. Cunningham was not there
for Chamberlain's 100-point game against the Knicks, but said: ``I
played with several guys who were there. Everybody denied that they
played him that night or they'd say, `I only had to guard him for a
minute.' I'd always ask them, `Then who in the hell did he score
all those points on?' It was a running joke in the league.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell you how many charities he's helped in his life,''
Cunningham said. ``He's a very caring person, especially when he
was away from the camera.''
</P>
<P>
   Concerning his reputation in the league, Cunningham added: ``He
was Goliath. He was the bad guy. No matter what he did, what he
achieved, they always booed him. That was just what Wilt had to
deal with. Some of that was because he was the first athlete that I
can remember who was outspoken about issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would say, `The guy can't play,' after a game. Say it like
it is. At the time, the public was not ready to deal with that kind
of honesty. I'm sure that fed into the persona people had about
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Jerry West, the Lakers' president who was a teammate of
Chamberlain's and won the 1972 championship in Los Angeles with the
big center, said: ``Wilt would sometimes say to me, `I can never
understand why they always boo me and they always cheer you. I told
him, `No one roots for Goliath.' We always laughed about that.''
</P>
<P>
   West added: ``His ability to come into a situation, look at the
people around him and try to make us a better team always amazed me
at the point in his career. He wanted to win. When I first started,
he helped make me a better player. We seemed to have a real good
feel together. He was one of those fabulous players that kind of
defined sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``I listen to players now and then, saying he couldn't play
today. `Sure, sure,' I always tell them. Let me tell you, they
wouldn't want to play against him.''
</P>
<P>
   As one of Chamberlain's greatest rivals, the Knicks had many
fond memories of the Big Dipper.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just remember he was dominating, a scoring machine,
unstoppable,'' Walt Frazier, the Knicks' Hall of Famer, said. ``The
guy looked indestructible. He was such a physical specimen, I never
thought something like this would happen to him at 63.
</P>
<P>
   ``His legacy is comical. When you read about his records, it
makes you laugh. He has records that are just remarkable. I don't
care if he was 10 feet tall, the things that he did. I think the
season he averaged 50, he averaged almost 30 rebounds, something
incredible like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Reed, another Knick Hall of Famer and currently the Nets'
57-year-old senior vice president, said: ``Going from offense to
defense, he would always run back and stand right in front of the
basket, so you weren't going to get any layups. That was out. I
used to score against him by playing outside. I wouldn't go in. I
used to try to go in and get cute and he would block all of that
stuff. He was a tremendous athlete.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the Russell-Chamberlain rivalry, Reed added: ``Bill used to
tell me that when he used to play Wilt, they'd get in town the
night before and he would always call him up and take him out to
dinner and be real nice to him so he'd feel sorry for him the next
night. Over my first couple of years in the league, they called me
`Rookie.' I called them Mr. Chamberlain and Mr. Russell. They were
the league. Those two guys were the two standout players.''
</P>
<P>
   The news of his death caught many in the game by surprise,
especially the people that had recently spent time with
Chamberlain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't believe it because they had a tribute to Russell in
June in Boston,'' Reed said. ``I was there and Wilt was there and I
had a chance to talk with him. I saw him then and in Cleveland when
they had the NBA 50. His knees were bothering him a bit, but other
than that he looked great.''
</P>
<P>
   Lenny Wilkens, the Atlanta Hawks' coach, said: ``It's a huge
loss because he was one of the great ambassadors for the NBA. He
was a very congenial guy. He had a great sense of humor.
</P>
<P>
   ``He used to love to run in New York. He had an apartment up
there and he used to run through Central Park with two dobermans
and we used to always joke that no one's going to try to rob him in
Central Park.''
</P>
<P>
   Don Casey, the Nets' coach, added: ``His persona in the league
was something that maybe some of us didn't understand in the
beginning. When he held out for money because he felt he was
underpaid, he probably knew more than most of us that the game was
a big entertainment business.''
</P>
<P>
   NBA commissioner David Stern said in a prepared statement:
``We've lost a giant of man in every sense of the word. The shadow
of accomplishment he cast over our game is unlikely ever to be
matched. We're gratified that in the last few years, the NBA family
has had the opportunity to tell him how much his contributions have
meant to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham added: ``I heard the news while I was driving down
the street and had to pull over. I couldn't drive the car for a
minute. I don't look at it as losing a basketball player. I look at
it as the loss of a friend.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember '67, my first season,'' Frazier said. ``I saw this
guy. He did everything, blocked shots, led the league in assists,
and he wasn't even scoring a lot, but he was doing all the
accessory things to make them a formidable team.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd just stare at him, and call him Chamberlain. If he spoke
to you, it was like, `Oh man.' You'd tell your buddies, `Hey, Wilt
knew my name.' '' &QL;

WILT CHAMBERLAIN: GIANT CONTRADICTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ To the generation of basketball fans who have grown up
since Wilt Chamberlain retired: You have no idea.
</P>
<P>
   Not just about the the enormity of the man, who was then dwarfed
by his staggering accomplishments. But about the contradictions.
</P>
<P>
   The only player to lead the NBA in scoring, rebounds and assists
could not execute consistently a basketball action often mastered
by 12-year-olds: The free throw.
</P>
<P>
   When the nation in 1968 was shaken by a civil rights movement
seeking long-denied justice, Chamberlain, who along with Muhammad
Ali may have been the world's most prominent black athletes,
endorsed Richard Nixon for president.
</P>
<P>
   The man who once averaged 48.5 minutes in a season for a
48-minute game (he played overtimes too) was sometimes criticized
for lacking competitive heart.
</P>
<P>
   For a player who remade basketball for all future big men, who
forced the rules writers to rejigger the game, who was the
7-foot-1, 275-pound acme of basketball's majestic power, his most
frequent contact with the game in his retirement was as a spectator
at Los Angeles Clippers' contests, where he was a pal of the club's
vile owner, Donald Sterling.
</P>
<P>
   For all his imagery as an invincible titan, he was probably too
soft, fearful of his power to injure. Said longtime rival and
friend Bill Russell of Chamberlain's famous 1970 Finals showdown
with gimpy-legged Willis Reed, who led the Knicks to victory over
the Lakers partly because Chamberlain seemed to back off:
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm the one playing Willis when he comes out limping, it
would only have emphasized my goal to beat them that much worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the behemoth Lothario who claimed to have bedded 20,000
women died Tuesday at home in bed, alone, never married.
</P>
<P>
   A man bigger than nearly all men and nearly all description,
Chamberlain's contradictions make him that much richer a character,
and so much more than a great ballplayer.
</P>
<P>
   Yet his ballplaying greatness has somehow been warped, not only
with time but through the green filter of Russell, his nemesis,
rival and friend whose unmatched career seemed fated to compromise
the game's most powerful, agile giant.
</P>
<P>
   As the pair locked up in a goateed grind in the low post
throughout the 1960s, it was Russell's Celtics who almost always
were superior to Chamberlain's Warriors, 76ers and Lakers teams.
Watching the NBA evolve on fuzzy black-and-white TVs, it seemed
that every winter Sunday was incomplete without at least a few
minutes spent watching Russell barely outmaneuver his formidable
adversary.
</P>
<P>
   Sports theater was rarely better. To witness two such skilled,
intelligent, dramatic rivals directly pitted against each other for
most of a decade was a national privilege, made all the more rare
by sports' failure to produce its like again.
</P>
<P>
   Russell's teams won 11 championships in 13 years, and he was
recently selected Sports Illustrated's greatest team player of all
time. Chamberlain's Philadelphia team of 1966-67 and his Laker team
of 1971-72 won titles, but it was never enough, even though those
teams may have been the best in league history.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all judged by the championships we win,'' said forlorn
Laker president Jerry West Tuesday, talking about his former
teammate and fellow 40-year hoop icon. ``Unfortunately, he only won
two.''
</P>
<P>
   Only won two.
</P>
<P>
   Think about that. Consider how many NBA greats, particularly in
the Michael Jordan era, never won a single one. But Chamberlain
seems forever consigned to secondary status because his foil had so
many more.
</P>
<P>
   The heat of their battle long since faded to cold embers,
Russell articulated, during the NBA All-Star game in 1997 that
featured the selection of its 50 greatest players, the truth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody seems to appreciate what an incredible player Wilt
was,'' he said. ``He was the best player of all time because he
dominated the floor like nobody else ever could. To be that big and
athletic was special.''
</P>
<P>
   That may be blasphemous in the recently concluded era of Jordan.
Comparisons between eras are always murky, as well as comparisons
between different positions. But there is one fact that usually
escapes consideration in the argument.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA of Chamberlain's time had about 100 players. The NBA
when Jordan dominated swelled to more than 300, meaning he came up
against nowhere near the caliber of competition Chamberlain took on
every night. Whether it was Russell or Reed, or Nate Thurmond, Walt
Bellamy or Wes Unseld, Chamberlain almost always ran into a quality
foe.
</P>
<P>
   He crushed 'em all.
</P>
<P>
   Forget the freakish, 100-point game. Those 50-point, 28-rebound
games that he (begin italic) averaged (end italic) didn't come
against Jim McIlvaine or Greg Ostertag. While 30 years of gene-pool
splashings may have improved the caliber of the average NBA
athlete, 30 years of expansion have spread those athletes around
much more broadly.
</P>
<P>
   Chamberlain in his prime today would be even more dominant than
in his day, because of the flatness of the surrounding territory.
And owing to growth of the NBA's popularity and the increase in
media coverage, his blunt, sometimes reckless personality would be
even more immense.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine a Dennis Rodman with brains, sophistication and
multidimensional talent.
</P>
<P>
   In his 1983 biography ``Giant Steps,'' Kareem Abdul-Jabbar wrote
about his hero worship as a kid of Chamberlain, his brief playing
rivalry as their careers crossed in the early 1970s, and of his
later contempt for his personal politics.
</P>
<P>
   But the game's giants eventually patched things up. And although
the book is filled with Abdul-Jabbar's belief of his superiority
over Chamberlain, he knew that in psychological as well as physical
stature, there was no one in the public mind quite like
Chamberlain.
</P>
<P>
   Abdul-Jabbar wrote: ``In airplanes and subways, on movie lines
or in the street, all big black guys were asked not, `Are you Bill
Russell?' but `Are you Wilt?' ''
</P>
<P>
   In his greatness, his contradictions and his foibles,
Chamberlain was a magnificent American original _ outsized, all
ways.

IN SHIFT, PHILIP MORRIS ACKNOWLEDGES EVIDENCE THAT SMOKING CAUSES
DISEASE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs to change Wednesday to Tuesday in 3rd graf)   (bl)  
 By BARRY MEIER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Philip Morris Cos. is acknowledging that scientific evidence
shows that smoking causes lung cancer and other deadly diseases,
after decades of disputing the findings of the U.S. surgeon general
and other medical authorities.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years Philip Morris, the nation's largest cigarette
maker, has moved closer to prevailing scientific opinions about the
health risks of smoking, as it has faced increasing pressure from
smoking-related lawsuits, regulators and Congress.
</P>
<P>
   But on a new Internet site it unveiled Tuesday as part of a $100
million corporate image campaign, the company unequivocally states
there is an ``overwhelming medical and scientific consensus that
cigarette smoking causes'' diseases including lung cancer,
emphysema and heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   It also states that smoking ``is addictive as that term is most
commonly used today.''
</P>
<P>
   Philip Morris' move is part of a trend among tobacco producers
to try to put health-related issues behind them, after agreeing in
the last two years to pay $246 billion to settle lawsuits brought
by states seeking to recover their Medicaid costs for treating ill
smokers.
</P>
<P>
   By making more disclosures about smoking risks, producers also
want to make it harder for those who start smoking now to sue by
claiming they were unaware of the dangers.
</P>
<P>
   Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco Co. created a Web site with
information on health issues last year, and R.J. Reynolds Tobacco
Co. is in the process of doing so.
</P>
<P>
   Several anti-smoking advocates who were read the new statements
by Philip Morris said they were a marked shift for the company,
particularly in the area of smoking and health. Previously, the
company had contended, for example, that smoking was a ``risk
factor'' or a ``causal factor'' in diseases like lung cancer, not
that it caused the diseases.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a profound change,'' said Dr. David Kessler, the former
head of the Food and Drug Administration, who launched a federal
effort to regulate tobacco, in response to the company's
statements. ``It really sets a new stage for regulation and
legislation.''
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Myers, a lawyer with the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids,
an advocacy group in Washington, agreed but added that Philip
Morris still had not taken the final step.
</P>
<P>
   ``The acknowledgments seem to be an abandonment once and for all
of the campaign of sowing doubts in the minds of consumers,'' said
Myers. ``But it falls a critical step short because it doesn't say
whether Philip Morris agrees with these conclusions.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Philip Morris chairman Geoffrey Bible testified
before a Senate committee that the company acknowledged that
substantial evidence supported the ``judgment that smoking plays a
causal role'' in diseases like lung cancer. Bible also testified
that the company recognized that ``under some definitions,
cigarette smoking is addictive.''
</P>
<P>
   Bible declined Tuesday to be interviewed. But responding to
Myers' comments, Steven Parrish, a senior vice president at Philip
Morris, said that Philip Morris was ``not going to dispute that
smoking causes cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, however, that the company would still require any
plaintiff in a lawsuit to prove that their disease was caused by
smoking rather than any other factor.
</P>
<P>
   Parrish added that the change in Philip Morris' position was not
the result of any new scientific findings. He said it had come
because the company had decided to take a less combative and
defensive position.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why Philip Morris had not changed its stance earlier, he
said ``that is all water under the bridge.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The company's new Internet site (www.philipmorris.com) is one
part of the Philip Morris campaign intended to reshape its
corporate image. Company officials said they will spend some $100
million annually on the effort, which will include television
advertisements emphasizing the company's charitable activities.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the campaign, Philip Morris will also downplay its
role as a cigarette producer. For example, while the company Web
site will contain the logos of two of its major divisions, Kraft
Foods and Miller Brewing, it does not show the distinctive logo of
the Philip Morris tobacco division or the red-and-white chevron of
its leading brand, Marlboro.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Parrish also said that another major goal of the campaign would
be to redirect the often-acrimonious debate about smoking into a
constructive one. ``This is a serious and good faith effort on our
part to try to engage in a dialogue,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco revised its Internet site
to reflect its stance on smoking and health issues. On it the
company states it ``believes that it is appropriate for the public
health community to conclude and warn the public that cigarette
smoking causes certain diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Tommy Payne, an official of R.J. Reynolds, said that producer
was also creating an Internet site that will speak ``more directly
and candidly'' about the issues of smoking and health. Payne said
he believed the industry effort followed a recently settled round
of lawsuits between cigarette makers and state attorneys general
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   In those lawsuits, the states argued that cigarette makers
should reimburse them for the cost of smoking-related health care
costs because they had misled the public by vigorously disputing
government findings about smoking and disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a new phase from a manufacturer's standpoint of how
you talk about the issues surrounding cigarettes,'' said Payne.
</P>
<P>
   As part of an earlier agreement between tobacco companies and
state officials that collapsed in Congress last year, cigarette
companies would have agreed not to have disputed public health
findings about links between smoking and disease.
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco producers, however, still face numerous legal problems.
In September, the federal government filed a major lawsuit that
charges cigarette makers with fraud and seeks to recover billions
in health care expenses. Two smokers also recently won separate
multimillion dollar judgment against Philip Morris, though the
company has appealed the verdicts.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Kessler, the former FDA commissioner, said he believed
that the recent steps by Philip Morris were important in that they
might give cigarette makers an opportunity to act on decisions they
might have made decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tobacco industry could have gone down this road in 1964
but decided instead to engage in a campaign of fraud and deception
that it is now paying for,'' he said.

<P>
   In 1972, Chamberlain helped the Lakers win their first
championship since moving to Los Angeles 12 years earlier from
Minneapolis, when he scored 24 points with a sprained wrist in the
decisive Game 5 against the New York Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   Even 18 years after his retirement, Chamberlain said he could
still play in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a hard thing to fathom,'' he said in a 1991
interview. ``I know what I'm capable of doing. It wouldn't be what
I was doing in the '60s, but I could go out and get 10, 11 rebounds
today. Those are league-leading numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd love to be playing today to get some of that money,'' said
Chamberlain, who earned $450,000 in his final season, 1972-1973.
``They couldn't afford me today. I helped make the league what it
is. I brought in a lot of fans.''
</P>
<P>
   His sister saw another side of him, she said Tuesday, eyes
rimmed in red and holding hands with her husband, Elzie, and
brothers Oliver and Wilbert.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was always one of our favorite, favorite people,'' Barbara
Lewis said. ``He was a truly family-oriented person, but he was a
private person. He liked to crack a good joke, though.''
</P>
<P>
   He showed an example of his offbeat sense of humor in his
autobiography. He wrote that after he died, he wanted to be
cremated and placed in a jar inscribed: ``I bet you wonder how all
of me got into this little jar. Well, the same way I got into those
little cars when I was alive. Where there's a Wilt, there's a
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg said he and Chamberlain's family ask that fans and
friends alike pray for the fallen star.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thanks to all the millions and millions of fans Wilt had all
over the world,'' he said. ``He's been a famous athlete since high
school. He has so many fans and so many friends -- to this day he
receives fan mail by the hundreds every month.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a giant among giants,'' Goldberg said, ``and let's hope
he rests in peace now.''
</P>
<P>
   Chamberlain's longtime groundskeeper saw him in the bedroom of
his hilltop home about 10 a.m., and thought he was dozing, Los
Angeles police Cmdr. David Kalish said. When he saw Chamberlain
still hadn't moved at 12:30 p.m., groundskeeper Joe Mendoza
checked, found he wasn't breathing and called 911.
</P>
<P>
   Paramedics arrived and pronounced Chamberlain dead at 12:41
p.m., Kalish said. He said the cause of death was natural. An
autopsy is pending.
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg said Chamberlain had experienced heart problems off and
on.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, his sister, said she last spoke to Chamberlain on
Saturday, and said he was complaining of extreme pain from surgery
Thursday to remove two teeth knocked back in his playing days. She
said he was on medication and had lost several pounds during the
ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was just not doing too well,'' she said, adding that he
rarely complained.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992 he was hospitalized after experiencing an abnormal heart
rhythm during a Lakers game at the Forum. The following day his
doctor said Chamberlain still had the slight arrhythmia, but was in
excellent condition at Centinela Hospital Medical Center in
Inglewood.

NBA ICON FOUND AT HIS BEL-AIR HOME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Wilt Chamberlain, who dominated basketball for the
Los Angeles Lakers and other teams through his size, agility and
demeanor, was found dead Tuesday at his home in Bel-Air. He was 63.
</P>
<P>
   Chamberlain, hospitalized with an irregular heart beat in 1992,
apparently died of a heart attack, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Known as ``Wilt the Stilt'' and ``The Big Dipper,'' the
7-foot-1, 275-pound center moved the game into a new era with
overpowering offensive skills that included the first monster
dunks, and which eventually convinced the league to widen the
free-throw lane to keep him farther from the basket.
</P>
<P>
   Scoring a record 100 points in a single game, Chamberlain's size
and speed set the standard for power centers, a role now held by
7-1, 315-pound Shaquille O'Neal of the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   Lakers executive vice president Jerry West said Chamberlain
created a new era in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we acquired Wilt, he rejuvenated my enthusiasm for
playing the game, and was one of the people who helped all of us
achieve our dream of winning an NBA championship,'' West said.
``I'm sure that basketball fans from all over the world are
saddened by the passing of this truly great icon.''
</P>
<P>
   Chamberlain generated adulation for his astonishing exploits and
criticism for his bravado, whether he was mulling a comeback long
after his 1973 retirement from the NBA, or boasting of his sexual
exploits.
</P>
<P>
   But his prowess on the court gave him grounds to boast.
</P>
<P>
   Chamberlain scored 31,419 points while playing in the National
Basketball Association, a record that stood until longtime rival
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar broke it in 1984. Chamberlain never fouled out
in his 1,205 regular-season and playoff games, and he still holds
the record for career rebounds with 23,924.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wilt was one of the greatest ever, and we will never see
another one like him,'' Abdul-Jabbar said.
</P>
<P>
   Chamberlain helped win two NBA championships -- including the
first for the Lakers in Los Angeles -- and earned four Most
Valuable Player awards.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, however, the outspoken Chamberlain made news
again when he claimed in his 1991 autobiography, ``A View From
Above,'' that he'd had sex with 20,000 women.
</P>
<P>
   The sensational statement only added to the hype that followed
Chamberlain through his life. But family and friends said that
Chamberlain was a modest, thoughtful man.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was one of the brightest, most intelligent guys I've ever
known,'' said Chamberlain's attorney and friend for 40 years,
Seymour Goldberg of Marina del Rey.
</P>
<P>
   He called the star ``a giant among giants.''
</P>
<P>
   Chamberlain had recently taken up the saxophone, was writing a
screenplay about his life and enjoyed late-night philosophy
discussions. ``He was really a man for all seasons,'' Goldberg
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Philadelphia native began his basketball career at Overbrook
High School, where at 6 feet, 11 inches he already loomed large
over his teen-age opponents.
</P>
<P>
   After playing two years at the University of Kansas and one for
the Harlem Globetrotters in 1958, he joined the NBA's Philadelphia
Warriors in 1959, and moved with the team when it relocated to San
Francisco in 1962.
</P>
<P>
   He returned to Philadelphia in 1964 when he was traded to the
76ers, then came to Los Angeles in 1968 in a blockbuster trade to
the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   Chamberlain also won MVP awards from 1966 through 1968, led the
league in scoring for seven straight seasons and in rebounding for
14.
</P>
<P>
   When asked Tuesday if Chamberlain was the greatest player ever,
Goldberg replied: ``He thought so, and I thought so, so that's two
of us.''
</P>
<P>
   But after the quip, he remarked that Chamberlain was offended by
attempts to compare players of different eras. And though he didn't
elaborate, Goldberg added that Chamberlain ``wasn't very happy with
the way he thought the league was going.''
</P>
<P>
   The big man's play at the University of Kansas and his NBA
career that spanned 1959-1973 were marked by opponents' extreme
attempts to contain him, including double-, triple- and even
quadruple-teaming him. His frustration with opponents and referees
made him consider quitting the NBA after his rookie year.
</P>
<P>
   He played a summer with the Harlem Globetrotters, but
reconsidered and returned to the Warriors that winter.
</P>
<P>
   Born Aug. 21, 1936, Wilton Norman Chamberlain was not only one
of the greatest NBA players of all time, but earlier this year,
ESPN named him one of the 20 greatest athletes of the 20th century.
In spite of his obvious talents, however, others labeled him
arrogant and selfish.
</P>
<P>
   To prove their respective points, critics of his ethic and
worshippers of his talent often cite the same game -- March, 2,
1962, when Chamberlain became the only player in NBA history to
score 100 points in a single contest.
</P>
<P>
   During that extraordinary display, Chamberlain and his
Philadelphia Warriors teammates beat the New York Knicks 169-147
before a crowd of only about 4,000 in Hershey, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   But Chamberlain was a sensation long before that game.
</P>
<P>
   In only his first year, he exploded onto the league, setting
all-time single-season records for points scored, rebounds and
points-per-game average, as well as five other marks. He naturally
won the league's Rookie of the Year and Most Valuable Player
awards.

METS' PIAZZA SET FOR RETURN

<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Mets regained the services of catcher Mike Piazza
for Game 1 of the National League Championship Series.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Bobby Valentine learned before noon that Piazza's
swollen left thumb would not prevent his catcher from playing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was even a little better than it was \RMonday\S, and
\RMonday\S was good enough to play,'' Valentine said.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza did not play during the Mets' final two victories against
the Diamondbacks in the Division Series. Piazza's replacement, Todd
Pratt, hit the 10th-inning, game-winning home run in Game 4 that
eliminated the Diamondbacks. Weiss in, Hernandez out Braves
shortstop Jose Hernandez struggled offensively against the Astros
during the Division Series, so manager Bobby Cox turned to veteran
Walt Weiss for Game 1 of the NLCS.
</P>
<P>
   Weiss emerged as one of the heroes of the Division Series with
his diving stop of Tony Eusebio's 10th-inning ground ball in Game
3. That helped the Braves escape a bases-loaded jam unscathed, and
Atlanta went on to win that contest, 5-3, in 12 innings. Weiss also
appears more comfortable at the plate through his work with hitting
coach Don Baylor.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looked good down in Houston when he came in, and Don's got
him swinging a lot better right now,'' Cox said. ``He's a great
defensive shortstop, and I thought I'd go that way for tonight's
game anyway.'' Baylor, Cubs meet The Cubs interviewed Baylor for
their vacant managerial position Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Baylor met with Cubs general manager Ed Lynch and president Andy
MacPhail for three hours after the Braves' workout. Baylor
interviewed with the Angels three weeks ago, but that was before
the resignation of general manager Bill Bavasi.
</P>
<P>
   The Brewers have also contacted Baylor, but he has not been
interviewed for their managerial opening. Cox takes high road Bobby
Valentine suggested this week that the Mets do not receive the
proper respect from the Braves. Bobby Cox, though, attempted to
downplay the animosity between the two ballclubs.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got a real classy ballclub over there,'' Cox said. ``I
like a lot of their guys. There's always a few players in the
league that you would rather not have on your team, but I couldn't
name you one on that team.'' Cox wants best-of-seven It would mean
the reduction of the regular season's 162-game schedule, but Cox
prefers that the Division Series be expanded to a best-of-seven
format like the LCS and World Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't think you play all year long to get knocked out
in three games,'' Cox said. ``It's not quite fair \Rto someone\S
like Texas.'' He said it ``Well, speaking from experience ... I
haven't had any, so I'm not sure.''

STARS' NEEDS ARE FILLED WITH CONTRACT EXTENSIONS

<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ |When the Stars signed center Joe Nieuwendyk and
goalie Ed Belfour this month, they signed two of their three
players scheduled to become unrestricted free agents next summer.
</P>
<P>
   They also pretty much took themselves out of the free-agent
market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really, what this does is we've signed our free agents for
next summer,'' Stars assistant general manager Doug Armstrong said.
``We won't, more than likely, be in that market because there is
not a need. We have our core center icemen, wingers, goalie and
defensemen taken care of.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say that Armstrong gets the summer off.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars have a number of restricted free agents' contracts
coming up this summer, including wingers Jere Lehtinen, Jamie
Langenbrunner and Blake Sloan and defenseman Sergei Zubov. On the
rise The Stars have one of the best top lines in the NHL in Mike
Modano, Jere Lehtinen and Brett Hull. Tonight, they face a line of
Owen Nolan, Vincent Damphousse and Jeff Friesen for San Jose that's
angling to get put in that category.
</P>
<P>
   They have combined for 10 goals and 13 assists in their first
five games, and the Stars realize slowing them down is going to be
tough.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're so fast. You just got to keep them to the outside and
not give them the middle of the ice,'' Stars defenseman Richard
Matvichuk said. ``Obviously, you have to be physical when you can
with that line.'' Expecting more from Modano Stars coach Ken
Hitchcock said he expects center Mike Modano to come back stronger
than ever from the injuries, both physical and mental, he
suffered.MDNM/ in an Oct. 2 game against Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   He also expects him to come back smarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you could call it a wake-up call, I think the wake up for
Mike is teams are going to take advantage of anybody on our team
that puts themselves in a vulnerable position,'' Hitchcock said.
``I think the hardest part will be moving onto that area of the ice
again. I think during warmups someone is going to have to smack him
into that area of the ice.'' Marshall to play
</P>
<P>
   Stars winger Grant Marshall (groin) said he felt better and
would play tonight.

LONGTIME RIVALS ADD ALCS TWIST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Baseball has only three rivalries of enduring
significance.
</P>
<P>
   There is the Los Angeles Dodgers and the San Francisco Giants, a
rivalry born in New York and kept alive with their joint move to
California in 1958. There is the Chicago Cubs and St. Louis
Cardinals, a heated Midwest affair brought back to life by Sammy
Sosa and Mark McGwire in their chase for the home run record.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the New York Yankees and the Boston Red Sox, as
fierce a rivalry as found in any sport. Their fates have been tied
together since the Red Sox sold Babe Ruth to the Yankees in 1919.
The teams take center stage again tonight when they meet at Yankee
Stadium for Game 1 of the American League Championship Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question it's going to be something special,''
Yankees manager Joe Torre said. ``As far as playing them, there's
no speech I could make that could get them excited more than
knowing they are going to Fenway Park and the Red Sox are coming
here.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees are coming off a three-game sweep of the Rangers in
the Division Series in which their pitchers held one of the best
offenses in baseball to one run in three games. The Red Sox, after
losing the first two games of their series to the Cleveland
Indians, advanced by rallying to win the final three games. They
did so with an offense that scored 44 runs in those three games,
finishing the job with a 12-8 victory in Game 5 on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``You savor the moment when you accomplish something like
that,'' Red Sox manager Jimy Williams said. ``We felt our team did.
But we know we have a hard task ahead of us here with this
ballclub. We are trying our best to prepare for it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees have dominated the rivalry from the moment Red Sox
owner Harry Frazee sold Ruth to the Yankees for $100,000 plus a
$300,000 loan. The Yankees have won 35 pennants and 24 World Series
since, while the Red Sox have won only four pennants. They haven't
won a World Series since 1918, when Ruth was the best left-handed
pitcher in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   The two years remembered most in the rivalry are 1949, when the
Yankees beat the Red Sox on the final two days of the season to win
the pennant by one game, and 1978, when New York prevailed in the
one-game East Division playoff on Bucky Dent's famous three-run
homer off Mike Torrez.
</P>
<P>
   The wild-card format, introduced in 1994, allows the two teams
to meet in postseason for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're a student of history, you have to be excited,''
Yankees pitcher David Cone said. ``It's great for baseball and it's
great for New England. It's a tremendous opportunity for Boston
fans; they've been waiting for this a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   What makes the Red Sox-Yankees rivalry particularly intense is
the cities are only 200 miles apart and both teams are usually
well-represented in the stands no matter if it is at Fenway Park or
Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're really going to see the excitement in the stands,''
Yankees designated hitter Darryl Strawberry said. ``Obviously, we
have to play the game on the field; but you go up to Boston, their
fans and the New York fans are always at each other's throats.''
</P>
<P>
   Tradition and a regular-season record of 98-64, best in the
American League, would seem to make the Yankees the favorites. They
have a deep pitching staff _ well-rested after the sweep of the
Rangers while the Red Sox are scrambling to set their pitching
staff after the grueling five-game series against the Indians.
</P>
<P>
   But the Red Sox took eight of 12 from the Yankees during the
regular season, including a three-game sweep Sept. 10-12 at Yankee
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have 25 guys who play hard and leave it out on the field,''
said Red Sox pitcher Kent Mercker, who is starting tonight. ``Being
an underdog is not a bad situation for us. When everybody expects
you to lose, it can be a source of motivation trying to prove them
wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest question for the Red Sox is if they have anything
left after their emotional victory over Indians.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not tired,'' Williams declared.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure the Yankees think we're emotionally spent,'' Red Sox
right fielder Trot Nixon said. ``No way. We're a bunch of battlers.
There's nothing but gamers in here.''

COX, BRAVES PLAY A WINNING HUNCH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Bobby Cox played a hunch in Game 1 of this National
League Championship Series.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves' playoff-tested manager inserted a 35-year-old
reserve into his lineup at shortstop, and that would be the
catalyst that propelled Atlanta to a 4-2 victory over the New York
Mets on Tuesday night at Turner Field.
</P>
<P>
   Walt Weiss, who served primarily as a reserve after Atlanta
acquired shortstop Jose Hernandez from the Chicago Cubs on July 31,
ignited the Braves' offense. Weiss went 3-for-4 with a run-scoring,
eighth-inning single, but it was his fifth-inning double that
allowed him to score what proved to be the game-winning run.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was kind of a storybook performance for Walt,'' said Cox,
who decided to start Weiss for his defensive skills with
right-hander Greg Maddux on the mound. ``He didn't have a whole lot
plays in the field, but we all know he can catch the ball. It was
just a terrific performance. He's only played sporadically for the
last month and a half, but this came at a good time.''
</P>
<P>
   Cox wanted Weiss in the lineup because of the number of ground
balls Maddux induces with his sinking, two-seam fastball. Maddux,
who surrendered only one run during his seven-inning appearance for
the victory, induced 12 ground-ball outs.
</P>
<P>
   Weiss' value, though, came at the plate after the Mets tied the
game with a fourth-inning run on a groundout by catcher Mike
Piazza. Weiss led off the fifth inning with a double against
right-hander Masato Yoshii and advanced to third on Maddux's
sacrifice bunt. Weiss scored on the ensuing single by left fielder
Gerald Williams, and the Braves never looked back after taking a
2-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gerald Williams is the guy who really got the club moving,''
Cox said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Maddux continued to mow down the Mets in typical
fashion. Maddux, who entered this contest 8-2 with a 2.28
earned-run average his career against the Mets, needed only 86
pitches to complete seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, he's Greg Maddux,'' Mets manager Bobby Valentine said.
``He doesn't have all those trophies because he's lucky. He's a
terrific pitcher, and he made good pitches when he had to. He
worked both sides of the plate, threw some curveballs early in the
game and did a good job. He did a very good job.''
</P>
<P>
   Yoshii took the loss, but the right-hander almost matched Maddux
inning for inning before departing during the fifth after spraining
his ankle while fielding Maddux's sacrifice bunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought Yoshii pitched his butt off,'' Valentine said.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves got an insurance run with the sixth-inning home run
by catcher Eddie Perez, who hit only seven during the regular
season after replacing the injured Javier Lopez as the starter.
</P>
<P>
   Braves closer John Rocker allowed an unearned run in the ninth
inning after a two-out error by third baseman Chipper Jones, but
the left-hander recorded the final four outs for the save.
</P>
<P>
   The victory marked the Braves' 10th this season in 13 games
against the Mets, who must win Wednesday afternoon or return to
Shea Stadium in New York trailing this best-of-seven series, 2-0.
The winner of Game 1 has won every NLCS since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always better to win the first game,'' Cox said. ``I'd
rather win it than lose it. That's for sure.'' nn

COWBOYS' IRVIN WANTS FAST RETURN TO THE FIELD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RAY BUCK 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Those mind-racing fears normally associated with
spinal injuries had subsided by the time injured Cowboys wide
receiver Michael Irvin spoke with coach Chan Gailey on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's ready to play. He wants to play,'' Gailey said yesterday.
``One of the first questions I got from him was, `What kind of
coverage did \RPhiladelphia\S play the rest of the game?'''
</P>
<P>
   Irvin could be out as many as six to eight weeks, which is more
a reality check, one source says, than it is a medical opinion at
this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was in really good spirits,'' said Gailey, who found some
personal relief in Irvin's upbeat nature less than two days after
his big scare.
</P>
<P>
   So Irvin already is itching to play; he's eager to get back on
the field, and he is curious to see how opposing defenses choose to
play in the meantime against Raghib ``Rocket'' Ismail and the other
Cowboys receivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody who knows Michaels knows that's him,'' Gailey said,
referring to Irvin's desire to get back. In fact, Gailey wants
Irvin to stay as close to the team as possible, even travel with
the Cowboys if he can.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Andrew Dossett, who has treated Daryl Johnston's neck
injuries since administering 1997 surgery, is scheduled to examine
Irvin today to determine what procedures, if any, need to be done,
and possibly how long he will be out.
</P>
<P>
   Johnston, who learned Sept. 14 that his season was over, has
spent the past month working as something of a coach with Tim
Lester and Robert Thomas at the fullback position. But Gailey said
that Irvin won't be expected to assume a similar role with the
receivers.
</P>
<P>
   Said Gailey: ``D.J. has the mind-set that he isn't going to play
this year, so he wants to know, `How can I help?' Michael's
mind-set is, `How fast can I get back?' I think they are different
mind-sets, totally.''
</P>
<P>
   Surgery for Irvin has not been entertained or ruled out because
the diagnosis is in the early stages, Cowboys trainer Jim Maurer
said. There also still is swelling and fluid in the spinal region
three vertebrae down from the skull.
</P>
<P>
   Irvin's place will be taken by veteran Ernie Mills and rookie
Wane McGarity, who are expected to split time although not
necessarily 50-50. McGarity was inactive the past two games because
of his limited contributions to special teams once Deion Sanders
came back to return punts.
</P>
<P>
   McGarity, who is looking for his first NFL regular-season catch
after having two drops in the Atlanta game Sept. 20, admittedly has
been ``frustrated'' by being inactive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't want a guy who wouldn't get frustrated by not
playing,'' said Gailey, who went to McGarity and advised him on
Friday before each of the past two games that he would not be
activated on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   McGarity watched the Cowboys' upset loss to the Eagles on TV
from his home in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey recalled McGarity's reactions each time he has told him
that he wouldn't be suiting up, that he was still on the 53-man
roster but not the game-day 45-man roster.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first game \Rvs. Arizona\S, he nodded his head but he
didn't know what it meant,'' Gailey said. ``Then last week \Rvs.
Philadelphia\S, he said, `Explain this to me,' so we went through
the whole scenario again.''
</P>
<P>
   Mills, who has eight receptions for 81 yards and no touchdowns
this season, is coming off a game in which he had as many drops as
catches _ two.
</P>
<P>
   Gailey has no plan sign an experienced receiver. He would rather
set up auditions for the young receivers, McGarity, Jeff Ogden,
Jason Tucker and Chris Brazzell.
</P>
<P>
   ``First, we want to see how it goes with Michael \Rrecovery and
rehab\N,'' Gailey said. ``Another thing we're taking into
consideration is that we want to see how well these young guys can
perform, and if they can reach expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   And how quickly they can do it. \Nsubheds:Briefly. Left tackle
Flozell Adams' play Sunday in his fourth career NFL start at left
tackle earned praise yesterday from Gailey, who said, ``Flo played
very well this past week. I don't use this word often, but I
thought he was especially dominant with his run-blocking. We're
very pleased with his progress in becoming a solid left tackle for
us for a very long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Cornerback-punt returner Deion Sanders is ``real close ... 90
percent or above'' in getting back to where he was before his toe
injury in November, Gailey said. Sanders will make his third start
of the season, but his first prime-time appearance, when the
Cowboys face the New York Giants at the Meadowlands on Monday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Cornerback Kevin Smith came out of Sunday's game with a tight
hamstring. It was Smith's first game action since Aug. 9. His back
(a bulging disk that sidelined him eight weeks) held up fine,
Cowboys trainer Jim Maurer said.
</P>
<P>
   Right guard Everett McIver (strained right hamstring) said he
hopes to resume practice full-go this week. If both McIver and
center Mark Stepnoski (lower back contusion) can start Monday night
against the Giants, it will mark the first time since the Sept. 12
season opener that the Cowboys have their starting offensive line
on the field together.

CHEEVER BELIEVES FAITH IN INFINITI WILL PAY OFF SOON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Eddie Cheever Jr. will attempt to engineer
Indy Racing League history for a second time this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Cheever is the only driver scheduled to compete with the Nissan
Infiniti Indy V-8 during the season-ending Mall.com 500-kilometer
race at Texas Motor Speedway on Sunday. Since the IRL introduced
its normally aspirated, 4.0-liter engine program in January 1997,
Oldsmobile Aurora V-8-powered cars have run the table. Auroras have
captured 28 poles, set 28 fastest laps of the race and scored 28
victories.
</P>
<P>
   Cheever was a three-time winner with the Aurora when he switched
to the Infiniti two races into the 1999 schedule, and after a
victory in the season opener at Orlando, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were the first to win with the Olds engine,'' said Cheever,
who captured the 1997 season opener, also at Walt Disney World
Speedway in Orlando. ``I have gambled our whole company on
Infiniti's ability to deliver a winning package. I will win with
this engine, soon.''
</P>
<P>
   The IRL cars have three hours of practice scheduled in two
sessions on Friday afternoon. Qualifying is set for noon Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Cheever's best qualifying effort this season was the fifth-place
run he made at TMS in June, when he hot-lapped the 1.5-mile
quad-oval at 213.430 mph. Cheever also led 13 laps at TMS before an
electrical problem relegated him to a 16th-place finish.
</P>
<P>
   But the Infiniti program has made noticeable performance gains
this summer. Cheever led twice for 32 laps in the most recent IRL
race at Las Vegas Motor Speedway on Sept. 26.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've done a lot of work to catch up with the GM package,''
Cheever said. ``The biggest change is we'll have the new 3.5-liter
configuration next year, and a good 60 percent of Infiniti's effort
over the last four months has been to that 3.5-liter engine.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheever's three victories with the Olds include the 1998
Indianapolis 500. But even claiming that jewel did not dissuade his
decision to switch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe in gambling,'' said Cheever, owner/driver of the No.
51 The Children's Beverage Group Dallara. ``As a team owner, I have
to look at what we're doing two or three years from now. The fact
we have not won since Orlando is not Infiniti's fault. I do believe
it is going to be the engine of 2000.'' \Nsubheds:Paul entered at
TMS John Paul Jr., winner of the IRL race at TMS last September,
will return to the series for the season-ending Mall.com 500.
</P>
<P>
   Paul will drive the No. 30 Big Daddy's BBQ Beef Jerky G
Force/Aurora fielded by McCormack Motorsports. Paul competed in the
first two races of the season with Jonathan Byrd-Cunningham Racing.
But the team suspended operations after being involved in the
tragedy-marred event at Lowe's Motor Speedway in Concord, N.C., on
May 1. \Nsubheds:Cup schedule released The flip-flopping of spring
race weekends between Bristol (Tenn.) Motor Speedway and Texas
Motor Speedway is the lone significant change in the 2000 NASCAR
Winston Cup schedule.
</P>
<P>
   The Cup series will compete on the half-mile, high-banked
Bristol track on March 26 and then head to TMS on April 2. The Cup
series ran in Fort Worth on March 28 this year, on a damp weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The 2000 schedule again will feature 34 races, beginning with
the Daytona 500 on Feb. 20. The schedule, which again includes road
races at Sears Point Raceway in Sonoma, Calif., and at Watkins Glen
(N.Y.) International, will conclude at Atlanta Motor Speedway on
Nov. 19.

WAC ATHLETIC DIRECTORS READY TO DEBATE EXPANSION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WHIT CANNING 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Western Athletic Conference commissioner Karl Benson
has read all the news reports, seen the film clips, even conducted
a teleconference. He remains puzzled on one point, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it's not important,'' he said, ``but I haven't actually
received any notification from TCU that they are leaving. I mean,
it's not a big deal; just thought I'd mention it.''
</P>
<P>
   Assuming the news reports are not an elaborate hoax, WAC
athletic directors will begin discussing expansion scenarios
Wednesday. Benson said he hopes to ``get a feel for their thinking,
and convey that to the presidents when they meet Sunday. It might
be nine schools, 10 or 12, or nothing. I personally feel that a
12-team league with two divisions is the best model, but I
understand the concerns about adding that many schools.''
</P>
<P>
   As for TCU's departure, Rice AD Bobby May said, ``I hate to lose
a conference member, and old Southwest Conference compadre. But
they're doing what they feel is best for them, and I can't fault
them for that. More than anything else, we lose a long relationship
with that school, and that's sad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to think that they'll be better off. Now it's our job
to do all we can to prove that they made the wrong decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Tulsa AD Judy MacLeod said, ``I'm disappointed that TCU is
leaving ... but I'm ecstatic that SMU is staying. I was really
afraid they would both go, and we would be cut off from the Dallas
area completely.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having that connection is very important to us and our fans,
and I'm glad it's not just us and Rice left over here in this
region.''
</P>
<P>
   Hawaii basketball coach Riley Wallace said, ``I don't really
feel that we lost a lot. Dallas is a good city, and SMU is a great
school with a program that's coming up. I would like to see us have
some stability, though.''
</P>
<P>
   Benson said he felt that under the circumstances, the WAC came
out lucky.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we caught a break,'' he said. ``I wouldn't feel that
way if we had lost both of them, but I'm certainly happy with the
one that's left in the WAC.
</P>
<P>
   ``SMU delivers Dallas, and I don't know that TCU necessarily
does. SMU is connected politically and media-wise to Dallas, and
that's important. I checked that out before I took this job, and I
was told that TCU alone cannot deliver it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, we need to convince the marketplace that we are a
valuable product regardless of whether one team leaves or not. As
for SMU going through a `healing process,' as has been suggested, I
think it will be brief, because president (Gerald) Turner and
(athletic director) Jim Copeland have gone out of their way to make
sure they didn't lose the respect of their peers.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Copeland attended the day's meeting, TCU was
represented by associate AD Jack Hesselbrock, prompting a question
to Benson about whether the presence of TCU AD Eric Hyman would
have caused added strain in the room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't answer that,'' Benson said, ``but I think Jim Copeland
would have been here today even if they were leaving.'' nn

AS LAME DUCK, TCU MIGHT FEEL WAC BACKLASH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DARRIN SCHEID 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ The timing of Monday's announcement that TCU
would join Conference USA in the 2001-2002 academic year was both
good and bad, Horned Frogs football coach Dennis Franchione said.
</P>
<P>
   Franchione preferred that TCU players hear it from coaches.
Instead, the players read about it in newspapers and watched it on
television. There was no practice Monday, and Franchione said it
would have been too difficult to round up that many people. He
discussed it with the team for the first time yesterday. He told
them life might not be fun as a lame-duck member of the Western
Athletic Conference for the rest of this season and next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The juniors and the seniors probably don't have much interest
because it won't affect them,'' Franchione said. ``But they need to
understand that as big as the bull's eye was on us, it might have
got a little bigger, if that's possible. It's something we'll deal
with. Some people might use this for motivation, I suppose.''
</P>
<P>
   The timing was good, however, because of Saturday's 6:05 p.m.
game against Tulsa (1-4, 0-2 in the WAC) at Amon Carter Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Frogs (2-3, 1-1) will have 75-100 potential recruits at the
game.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt, a move from the WAC to Conference USA will come up in
the sales pitch. The WAC has a tie with one bowl game next season,
and C-USA has contracts with three bowls. The WAC's television
contract guarantees seven football broadcasts, compared with the
current C-USA contract of 25 TV games per season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids want to know about television and bowls,'' Franchione
said. ``Conference USA has a nice, well-thought-out package that
I'm sure will grow. There is also some name identity. Conference
USA just seems to be doing a great job of creating a very good
image of itself.'' \Nsubheds:Not a bad week TCU junior running back
LaDainian Tomlinson said it's turning out to be a pretty good week
for the Frogs. Tomlinson's 300-yard performance Saturday made him
the leading rusher in NCAA Division I-A with an average of 176.4
yards per game. Two days later, TCU is invited to join a new
conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all recognition for TCU, so it's all a good thing,''
Tomlinson said. ``It is kind of weird to look in the stats and see
my name up there. It's a tribute to everybody. Now, we have to keep
it going.''
</P>
<P>
   Before this season, Tomlinson's two best rushing days came
against Tulsa. He ran for 165 yards against the Golden Hurricane in
1998. He rushed for 180 yards and two touchdowns against Tulsa in
1997. \Nsubheds:Plays for Batteaux Dennis Franchione said the
coaching staff is thinking of ways to get senior quarterback
Patrick Batteaux more playing time, which might result in some
plays at wide receiver. It will not happen Saturday against Tulsa,
however.
</P>
<P>
   But in two weeks, when the Frogs play Rice, they could have
starting freshman quarterback Casey Printers and Batteaux in the
game at the same time. Batteaux, who is recovering from a ligament
injury in his left hand, would remain the team's backup
quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still need him at quarterback, but I know he wants to be in
the game,'' Franchione said. ``He's always played, and even though
he would never complain about his current situation, I know this is
hard for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Batteaux entered Saturday's 42-0 victory against San Jose State
in the third quarter at quarterback.

NIEUWENDYK SIGNS CONTRACT EXTENSION; CHAMBERS SIDELINED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Stars playmaker Joe Nieuwendyk wasn't born in
Texas, but he got here as fast as he could.
</P>
<P>
   Now, four years after getting traded from Calgary, he's staying.
Nieuwendyk, last season's Stanley Cup most valuable player, signed
a three-year, $15 million contract extension that ensures he will
be in a Stars uniform through the 2002-2003, likely the end of his
career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I see myself playing too many years behind it
but you never know,'' Nieuwendyk said. ``I have a little time to
worry about that. I just think the team is committed too, to having
a good team here. I think I'd be crazy not to be a part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars were in need of some good news Tuesday after
arthroscopic surgery on defenseman Shawn Chambers brought bad news.
What started out as exploratory surgery on his right knee turned
into surgery to remove pieces of cartilage and repair cartilage in
the socket which had been worn thin.
</P>
<P>
   He will be on crutches for six weeks, begin rehabbing after that
and will be out until at least mid-January. Until then, the Stars
will rely on Brad Lukowich and Alan Letang to absorb Chambers'
20-plus minutes a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shawn's injury, probably for the team out of what could've
transpired, is a worst-case scenario,'' Stars coach Ken Hitchcock
said. ``From our standpoint, we've got to look at this as a real
opportunity for the younger guys. It is going to give us an
opportunity to have a long-term look at Lukowich and Letang.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as the Stars get Mike Modano (concussion) and Darryl Sydor
(fractured left eye socket) back from injured reserve for Wednesday
night's game against San Jose at Reunion Arena, Chambers goes out.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Hitchcock has shuffled his usually staid
defensive pairs to compensate. Last year, the Stars' defense
remained as unchanged as CBC hockey commentator Don Cherry's
wardrobe remains bright.
</P>
<P>
   He has Sydor playing with Jamie Pushor, a chance to get him
extended playing time. Sydor's usual partner, Sergei Zubov, has
been paired with Derian Hatcher, turning that into a shutdown
tandem with skill. Richard Matvichuk will be playing with Lukowich
and Letang.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't see us playing in three groups of two,''
Hitchcock said. ``I see us with six defensemen. I don't see us as
definitive this year as we were last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatcher and Matvichuk were like an old married couple, always
together as the No. 1 defensive pair. Likewise for Zubov and Sydor.
Only they were the skilled pair.
</P>
<P>
   ``It changes for Zubov because he takes additional minutes in a
defensive role, but I think he's ready for that challenge,''
Hitchcock said. ``It changes for Syd because he is going to have to
kill more penalties than he did.''
</P>
<P>
   While adjustment was the short-term theme around StarCenter
Tuesday, stability was the long-term theme. With Nieuwendyk's
extension, the Stars now have the core of the team that won the
Stanley Cup tied up for the next three years.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars already had Sydor (three years), Matvichuk (four
years), Hatcher (four years), Modano (five years) and goalie Ed
Belfour (three years) locked up in long-term deals.
</P>
<P>
   Belfour signed a two-year, $11.5 million extension on Oct. 1,
and at that time contract talks with Nieuwendyk looked to be tabled
until next spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a chance to sit down one more time and Joe said he'd
like to work something out,'' Stars assistant general manager Doug
Armstrong said. ``So we went back to work and over the last week on
the last road trip we had a chance to spend some time together to
work on an extension that keeps the core of our team in so next
year we won't lose any players to free agency.''
</P>
<P>
   Nieuwendyk acted as his own agent, negotiating his contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't call myself Arliss,'' Nieuwendyk said, referring to
a fictional sports agent on the HBO show Arli$$.
</P>
<P>
   Just a Texan. nn

AGGIES' OFFENSIVE LINE, RUN DEFENSE WORRY SLOCUM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLLEGE STATION, Texas _ Texas A&AMP;M coach R.C. Slocum offered
some sobering words yesterday to fans who consider the 13th-ranked
Aggies back on the inside track toward a third consecutive Big 12
South Division title after a 45-13 rout of Baylor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still not a championship-caliber team,'' Slocum said.
``We've got a couple of areas we need to shore up if we're going to
stay in the race.''
</P>
<P>
   Heading the list of concerns as A&AMP;M (4-1, 1-1) prepares for
Saturday's 11:30 a.m. meeting with Kansas (2-4, 0-2) at Kyle Field
is his offensive line. Andy Vincent, the Aggies' starting right
tackle, suffered a concussion against Baylor and is not expected to
play against Kansas. Michael Mahan, a redshirt freshman who has
started the past two games at left tackle, worked at right tackle
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Tango McCauley, slowed the past two weeks because of a sprained
ankle, is expected to make his first start at left tackle against
Kansas. But McCauley, a converted defensive lineman, has been slow
in responding to treatment. If McCauley can't play, Slocum said he
is unsure where he would turn for a replacement.
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;M's tackle ranks were depleted when starter Shea Holder
suffered a season-ending knee injury Sept. 25 against Southern
Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   Slocum said he also wonders about a run defense that ranks sixth
in the nation (67.8 yards per game) but ``hasn't really been
tested'' except during a 21-19 loss to Texas Tech, when Red Raiders
fullback Sammy Morris rolled for 170 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Each of Kansas' top three tailbacks averages at least 4.6 yards
per carry, with Mitch Bowles coming off a career-high 101 yards
against Kansas State and starter David Winbush (55 carries, 255
yards) slated to return to the lineup after missing last week with
knee and ankle ailments.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the prospect of playing without tailback Dante Hall
(back) and fullback D'Andre Hardeman (groin) against the Jayhawks,
Slocum said he is encouraged by A&AMP;M's depth at running back.
Reserve tailbacks Eric Bernard and Joe Weber combined to rush for
131 yards and two touchdowns against Baylor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got more depth this year,'' Slocum said. ``If we get
down to two available backs, we still have capable people.''
\Nsubheds:Warren's cast removed Defensive end Ty Warren, one of the
most celebrated members of A&AMP;M's 1999 freshman class, had a cast
removed yesterday that protected a broken left thumb. Warren
(6-foot-4, 277 pounds) suffered the injury Aug. 18 and has seen
limited playing time. He has yet to record a tackle.
</P>
<P>
   Slocum said that should change now that Warren can use both
hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look forward to getting him on the field,'' Slocum said. ``I
think he would've helped before now if not for that injury.''
\Nsubheds:On the sideline Outside linebacker Jason Glenn, limping
yesterday because of a sprained ankle, said he ``definitely'' will
play against Kansas. Slocum disagreed, saying, ``We can't afford
... to risk losing him for another two weeks if he reinjures
himself because he's not 100 percent.'' Glenn leads A&AMP;M in tackles
for losses (nine for minus-39 yards).

MAVERICKS TO HONOR BLACKMAN BY RETIRING NO. 22 JERSEY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DWAIN PRICE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Three years after he retired from basketball, Rolando
Blackman will receive an honored place in the Mavericks'
organization.
</P>
<P>
   In a show of family unity, the Mavericks plan to retire
Blackman's No. 22 jersey during halftime of the team's March 11
home game against the Phoenix Suns.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tremendous, great feeling for me,'' Blackman said
Tuesday. ``I'm very happy and very proud, and it'll be a special
day.''
</P>
<P>
   The only other jersey the Mavericks have retired in the team's
19-year history is Brad Davis' No. 15. Davis is ecstatic about his
jersey hanging in the Reunion Arena rafters with Blackman's.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was getting lonely up there,'' Davis said. ``It's good for
Ro, and I'm glad to see it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was really a professional _ the way he practiced and the
way he played. He practiced hard, he played hard, he played hurt,
and he always seemed to make big shots when we needed them.''
</P>
<P>
   Mavericks president and CEO Terdema Ussery notified Blackman
about the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rolando's one of the greatest players to ever play for the
Mavericks franchise,'' Ussery said. ``And he, just as importantly,
conducted himself on and off the court in a way that made everybody
in this city proud.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time to honor him and to show him how much we appreciate
what he did for the organization, and what he continues to do in
terms of how he represents the Mavericks and the city of Dallas in
his business pursuits.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if plans are in the works to retire the jerseys of two
other prominent players who also helped lay the foundation for this
franchise, Derek Harper and Mark Aguirre, Ussery said: ``One at a
time. This is about Ro, and that's what we're focused on right now,
just trying to make sure that he has a day and a night to
remember.''
</P>
<P>
   Blackman, 40, played for the Mavericks from 1981-92, averaging
19.2 points and shooting 49.7 percent from the field. The 6-foot-6
shooting guard was selected to All-Star teams in 1985-87 and 1990
and played in all 48 of the Mavericks' playoff games.
</P>
<P>
   When Blackman was the ninth pick of the 1981 draft from Kansas
State, he said he only had one mission on his mind at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just trying to beat out Elston Turner to get a chance to
get some playing time,'' Blackman said. ``Then, all of a sudden, my
career blossomed, and I became one of the best.''
</P>
<P>
   After playing 11 years with the Mavericks, Blackman was traded
to the New York Knicks on June 24, 1992, for a first-round draft
pick. He played two years for the Knicks _ they lost to Houston in
the 1994 NBA Finals _ and finished his pro career in 1996 after
playing one season in Athens, Greece, and one year in Milan, Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Mavericks forward Cedric Ceballos said Blackman should have had
his jersey retired ``a long time ago.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a history buff, and Rolando was always a calm, clutch
player,'' Ceballos said. ``I think it's a good move by the
organization to honor such a great player.''
</P>
<P>
   A Brooklyn native, Blackman and the Mavericks were one game away
from reaching the 1988 NBA Finals. They lost a seven-game series to
the Los Angeles Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   Blackman, who lives in Frisco, is a college-basketball analyst
for ESPN. He also has a video voice and data company and works with
Aguirre on a website called lifecast.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a fantastic career,'' Blackman said. ``But this
retirement ceremony should be a glowing situation not only for me
but also for all of the people who helped me become the person that
I am today.'' STRONG DEBUT FOR WALKER
</P>
<P>
   Did anyone catch Samaki Walker's opening act for the San Antonio
Spurs over the weekend? Mavericks coach/general manager Don Nelson
heard about it. So did many players and front-office employees.
</P>
<P>
   Walker, who spent a lion's share of last season in Nelson's
doghouse after turning down the team's four-year, $20 million
contract extension, scored the winning basket as the Spurs opened
preseason play with a 98-97 victory at Philadelphia. In victory,
Walker was phenomenal.
</P>
<P>
   The third-year power forward converted 7-of-12 shots, made
9-of-9 free throws, grabbed seven rebounds, recorded two blocks and
scored 23 points off the bench. Nelson didn't sound surprised.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect him to do well,'' he said. ``He's a good player.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did try to keep him here. We offered more money than (the
Spurs) did. He wanted to move.''
</P>
<P>
   Spurs coach Gregg Popovich is more than happy to have Walker as
a part of his team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since Walker has come to camp, we've made him an outside guy
instead of an inside guy,'' Popovich said. ``It just seemed
apparent that he's real comfortable facing the basket.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that we're right. It looks like we might be.'' WILLIAMS
GETS INJECTION
</P>
<P>
   Backup center John ``Hot Rod'' Williams received the first of
three weekly steroid injections of Epidual on Tuesday, and will
likely start the regular season on the injured list.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who has yet to practice this season because of chronic
back spasms, will not be available for any basketball activities
for at least three weeks. The season opener is Nov. 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little bit of a setback for him,'' Don Nelson said.
``But there's nothing we can do about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams is being treated by Dr. Andrew Dossett, a back and
spine specialist who also works with Cowboys and Rangers players.

IRVIN'S FIRE WILL BE MISSED AS MUCH AS HIS OUTPUT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There has never been a shortage of opinions on Cowboys receiver
Michael Irvin.
</P>
<P>
   More proof came during ugly proceedings Sunday at Veterans
Stadium. As Irvin lay motionless on the turf with head and neck
trauma after being hit by Eagles safety Tim Mauck, Eagles fans
cheered, while Eagles players waved their hands to quiet the crowd
in a show of respect for a worthy adversary.
</P>
<P>
   Irvin escaped serious injury. But it is uncertain when he will
play again.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys, who quietly believe Irvin's absence could be six to
eight weeks, must find a way to play on without him.
</P>
<P>
   It won't be an easy task, no matter the opinion of him.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, Irvin put the ``c'' in controversial and has been equally
glorified and despised for much of his 11-year career.
</P>
<P>
   His trash-talking, showboating style made him a villain on the
field long before his off-field troubles turned him into the NFL's
marquee bad boy.
</P>
<P>
   His playmaking output, which has him ranked among the top 10
receivers in NFL history to go along with three Super Bowl titles,
has him poised as a shoo-in for the Pro Football Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   One thing that both his apologists and detractors can agree on
is that the fiery Irvin has also always been a consummate warrior.
He has long been the heart and soul of Cowboys, who fed off his
boundless energy during the Super Bowl title seasons in 1992, 1993
and 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Never considered the most talented player, Irvin is a superstar
player because of his unparalleled intensity, competitiveness and
work ethic. Irvin, 33, has not missed a game due to injury since
1990, when he missed the first four recovering from knee surgery.
</P>
<P>
   That's 139 straight, excluding the five he missed in 1996 for
violating the NFL's substance-abuse policy.
</P>
<P>
   That same work ethic is the reason many believe Irvin will be
back as good as ever before the season is over and maybe before the
doctors anticipate. Irvin, who openly talked about the Super Bowl
last week, is real excited about what the Cowboys can do this
season and will likely ``break his neck'' to get back on the field.
</P>
<P>
   In the interim, the Cowboys, who are considering not re-signing
Irvin next season because of his age and declining output, will get
a free glimpse of life without Irvin's continual chatter on the
field and the locker room.
</P>
<P>
   The view didn't look so good in the final three quarters Sunday.
As more than not having someone to step up and make a play
offensively, the Cowboys also lacked emotion.
</P>
<P>
   Say what you will about Irvin's finger-pointing, body-shaking
maneuvers, they often charged his teammates into a frenzy and
spurred scoring drives. Cowboys coach Chan Gailey's play-calling,
Raghib Ismail's speed and Troy Aikman's leadership all had the
impact of a funeral procession against the Eagles.
</P>
<P>
   Backup receivers Ernie Mills and Wane McGarity have been charged
with trying to pick up Irvin's on-field production in the interim.
But the facts are if somebody doesn't replace his act-a-fool
passion, he will return just in time for another burial _ the
Cowboys' season.
INSIDE THE LOCKER ROOM
</P>
<P>
   There has been some talk about the Cowboys' signing a veteran
receiver to replace Irvin. But there's just one problem. Any
receiver that could help the Cowboys is already on somebody's
roster. There is a reason guys are unemployed five weeks into the
season. But for you hard-headed folks, here is a short list of
available choices _ unemployed, flawed veterans Michael Jackson,
Randal Hill and Alvin Harper.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is problem two _ Chan Gailey's intricate offense. Any
newcomer would be hardpressed to learn the offense well enough to
become a factor at this point in the season. Very little teaching
is done during the season. Teams work on plays and game plans.
Taking time away to catch one person up to speed retards the
offensive process for the team as a whole.
YARDSTICKS: HOW FAR DO THE COWBOYS HAVE TO GO?
PASSING DOWN
</P>
<P>
   With seven interceptions through four games, the Cowboys are on
pace for 28, which would be their highest total in 13 years. The
Cowboys mustered just 21 pickoffs the past two years combined,
including a paltry seven in 1997.
IN THE `RED' ZONE
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys' offense is tied for first in the NFL in red-zone
touchdown efficiency. They have nine touchdowns and one field goal
on 12 trips inside their opponent's 20-yard line. The problem is
that they are 20th in number of trips in the red zone. They were
there just once against the Eagles.
FOURTH DOWN
</P>
<P>
   Last season the Cowboys' special teams units were among the
league's elite _ ranking first in kickoff coverage, third in punt
coverage, fourth in punt-return average and 12th in kickoff return
average. So far in 1999, they are third, 25th, 19th and 14th in the
same categories, respectively. nn

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ There was a prominent skid mark on the third-base line
of Turner Field, a glaring reminder in full view of the New York
Mets' dugout of their stumbles on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   General Manager Steve Phillips tested an analogy the other day,
suggesting that the last time the Mets had faced the Braves, they
were sliding down a slippery slope and now, reinvigorated by their
rush into the National League Championship Series, they were
climbing the mountain wearing spiked boots. But when Roger Cedeno
sprayed white chalk on the infield grass in his frantic attempt to
get back to third base after Masato Yoshii failed to squeeze him
home in the third inning, it was clear that the crampons were
failing.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets, in a renewal of the late-season failure to get timely
hits that nearly doomed their bid to make the playoffs, lost their
grip on a closely played game and lost 4-2 to the Braves to drop
the first opener of their four-of-seven-game League Championship
Series.
</P>
<P>
   If the third-base line was too oblique a symbol for the Mets'
continuing woes against the Braves, who dominated them in their
regular-season series, then the sight of Melvin Mora, standing on
third base while the Braves reliever John Rocker, who got the save,
zipped fastball after fastball by John Olerud to end an
eighth-inning threat, and Rey Ordonez grounding out to end a
ninth-inning rally that had already scored one run were more
direct.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets, who were sent into a nearly fatal funk by Braves
pitching just three weeks ago _ Rocker saved all three of those
games, too _ had provided entertaining theater in getting back to
Atlanta. But from the looks of this game, they hadn't gained much
ground on the decade's premier National League team. This loss,
which sends the Mets into a hole with Kevin Millwood starting
Wednesday for the Braves, was, despite the drama of the last 10
days, eerily similar to the five late-season losses to Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the good news,'' Manager Bobby Valentine said. ``You
can only have so many of these in a year. I think we're going to be
able to play these games and play for the break.''
</P>
<P>
   But these kinds of games against the Braves are mounting, and
now, with a World Series slot on the line, there is little time for
the Mets to wait for a break. A few of the daunting figures: Rickey
Henderson, 0 for 4; Mike Piazza, his timing off a bit from the two
games he missed with a swollen thumb, 0 for 4; Robin Ventura, who
hit just .174 against the Braves in the final six games, 0 for 3,
with a strikeout looking for the second out in the ninth inning;
Darryl Hamilton, 0 for 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``He does not have all those trophies because he's lucky,''
Valentine said of Greg Maddux, who held the Mets to one run on five
hits in seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   The bad omens started to pile up for the Mets before the first
inning ended. Maddux, whom the Mets had somehow managed to hammer
for their only victory of their six games against the Braves in the
last 10 days of the season, retired the side in the first inning on
just nine pitches.
</P>
<P>
   The next chilling sign came in the form of Orel Hershiser, the
starter sent to the bullpen for long relief in the playoffs,
already warming up after Masato Yoshii had faced just three
batters.
</P>
<P>
   Yoshii had none of the control early in the game that had made
him the Mets' most consistent starter since August, and Gerald
Williams smacked Yoshii's first pitch of the game up the middle for
a single. Williams stole second and scored when Bret Boone reached
up to slug a full-count, shoulder-high pitch for a chopper up the
middle to give the Braves a 1-0 lead, which looms when Maddux is on
the mound.
</P>
<P>
   But in the top of the third came the strongest signal yet that
the pixie dust that had glistened on the Mets for the last 10 days
had worn off a bit.
</P>
<P>
   Cedeno doubled to lead off the inning, the first hit the Mets
got off Maddux. Cedeno's shot went into left field and Williams,
the left fielder, threw the ball in to second baseman Boone, the
cut-off man. But Boone had to travel 30 feet to even get close to
the ball, which he missed. As the ball rolled away, Cedeno went to
third base on the error.
</P>
<P>
   Then came a fiasco that, should the Mets not advance, may go
down as one of the crucial lost chances of this series. Ordonez
topped a pitch that rolled along the third-base line. He stood
still watching it. But the Braves' catcher, Eddie Perez, astutely
picked up the ball, which had remained fair, and threw to first
base, getting Ordonez out without even having to check third to
make sure Cedeno was not moving.
</P>
<P>
   Worse was what came next. On a 2-0 count, Yoshii had received
the sign to bunt, to start a suicide squeeze to bring Cedeno home.
But Yoshii missed the ball entirely and Cedeno was caught in
no-man's land, already more than halfway home. Perez ran him down,
and the mark Cedeno made was symbolic of the Mets' mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   ''At the time it was a really big play,'' Valentine said. ``We
had a chance to tie it up, and we missed the squeeze.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets finally scored in the fourth inning to tie the game
when Edgardo Alfonzo smashed a double into left-center and later
came home on a Piazza groundout. But Yoshii, who had allowed just
one base runner since the first inning, encountered trouble again
in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Walt Weiss, whom Atlanta Manager Bobby Cox had put into the
lineup at shortstop because of the defensive skill that may have
saved the Braves' season during the division series against
Houston, smacked a leadoff double into right field, one of his
three hits. Maddux bunted back to the mound to move Weiss to third,
but Yoshii came off awkwardly and turned his left ankle before
throwing Maddux out.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets' trainer, Fred Hina, and Valentine came out to check on
Yoshii, and in his warm-up pitches, he seemed to hop a little on
the left foot. But he remained in the game to face Williams. It was
a bad decision.
</P>
<P>
   Jumping on Yoshii's first pitch again, Williams hit a single to
left field. Henderson overran the ball and, while Weiss scored to
give the Braves a 2-1 lead, Williams went to second base. But the
Braves again failed to batter the Mets. Cedeno made a
full-extension diving catch of a Boone fly ball for the second out
and, after Chipper Jones was intentionally walked and after Yoshii
was removed for Pat Mahomes, Jordan flied out to end the inning.
Yoshii, bothered by his ankle, had been chased after allowing the
Braves two runs in four and two-thirds innings
</P>
<P>
   The Braves' failure to pile up runs might have had more impact
on the game if the Mets could have made something of their at-bats.
In addition to the suicide-squeeze debacle, the Mets stranded
runners in scoring position in the fourth, sixth and eighth
innings. The Braves added two more runs, one on a home run by
Perez. By the time the Mets failed to add more than just one run in
the ninth _ Hamilton came in on Todd Pratt's pinch-hit single _ it
felt as if the Braves had beaten the Mets more thoroughly than the
score indicated and pushed the recent upstart just a bit farther
down the hill.

WILT'S LEGACY ASSURED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Wilt Chamberlain played his last official game of basketball in
1973. But every time I saw him, I wondered why he ever retired.
</P>
<P>
   He quit the game at 37 after 14 NBA seasons, which seems
premature by today's standards. After dragging the likes of Clyde
Lovellette, Tommy Heinsohn, Walt Bellamy, Nate Thurmond and Bill
Russell up and down the court for 14 seasons, he certainly deserved
a rest.
</P>
<P>
   But this man was never out of shape. In the '70s and '80s, he
was a regular on the local track and volleyball scene. On one
particular Saturday, after watching a UCLA dual meet at Drake
Stadium, Chamberlain, a high jumper at Kansas, went down to the
field to talk to some of the jumpers.
</P>
<P>
   With maybe a dozen people still in the facility, most of them
athletes or writers, Wilt, shoeless, loped up to the high jump bar
and, using the old split jumping style, cleared a height estimated
at seven feet. He was around 45 at the time.
</P>
<P>
   A few years later, he showed up on a sports talk show and said
with aplomb that he could still play in the NBA. He was in his 50s
by now. Some critics scoffed, but only those who harped on the
drain of an 82-game schedule.
</P>
<P>
   In a one-on-one situation, no one doubted he could handle the
modern NBA post man. I certainly didn't. Neither did Jerry West.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trust me,'' said Lakers General Manager Jerry West, ``today's
players wouldn't want to play him.''
</P>
<P>
   No one ever handled Chamberlain during his 14-year NBA career,
with the obvious exception of his nemesis, Boston's Bill Russell.
And even then, it wasn't a matter of Russell handling Chamberlain
as much as containing him and having the good fortune to play on
superior teams.
</P>
<P>
   During the NBA's 50th anniversary party two years ago, Russell
chuckled at those who said he got the better of Chamberlain because
he won ten titles compared to Chamberlain's two. Russell won the
titles, but Chamberlain always attended. His teams made it to the
finals or conference finals in 12 of 14 seasons, and he lost a Game
7 to the Celtics by four points or less four times.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Celtics were the greatest franchise of all time,'' Russell
said. ``But each time we played for the title, Wilt always stood in
my way. I took great pride in my defense, yet he had so many great
games against me. I remember a game when someone congratulated me
for holding Wilt to 55 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wilt was a very intelligent player. I could not play him the
same waymes in a row, and there were a lot of guys I never
ever had to change the way I played. There are things Wilt did that
no one will ever come close to doing -- 100 points in a game, 55
rebounds in a game, averaging 27 rebounds and 50 points a game for
a full season.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the many NBA records Chamberlain still holds is the 55
rebounds he posted in one game. Considering the opponent that
night, Russell and the Celtics, it might be a more meaningful
record than his 100-point game against the Knicks in 1962.
</P>
<P>
   Chamberlain led the league in scoring his first seven seasons,
with a low of 33.5 (1966) and a high of 50.4 (1962), and in
rebounding 11 of 14 seasons. This was during an era of the NBA when
every team had a center with guile, strength or both.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-six years after retiring, Chamberlain still holds NBA
records for career rebounds (23,924), highest single game shooting
percentage (100 percent, done three times in 1967), fewest
disqualifications (he did not foul out once in 1,045 games) and
most games with 50 or more points (118).
</P>
<P>
   He undoubtedly would hold the record for blocked shots, too, if
the league had taken the time to keep the stats during his career.
There were also subtle shifts in league rules (lane, goaltending)
that were a direct result of Chamberlain's presence.
</P>
<P>
   But fitting his reputation as a renaissance man off the court,
Chamberlain showed great diversity on it. After leading the league
in scoring seven straight seasons, Chamberlain changed his game
with the Philadelphia 76ers and won three straight MVP awards.
</P>
<P>
   He turned his attention to setting up others rather than just
scoring. In 1967, he averaged 7.8 assists a game and led the 76ers
to the NBA title. In '68, he led the league in assists (702, 8.6 a
game).
</P>
<P>
   And when he came to the Lakers for the 1968-69 season, he
subjugated his game even further in deference to West, Baylor and
Gail Goodrich. Defense became his forte; in the last two seasons of
his career, he was named to the league's all-defense team.
</P>
<P>
   As gawdy as his statistics were with Philadelphia and San
Francisco, his first four seasons with the Lakers might have been
his most rewarding.
</P>
<P>
   In 1969, he lifted the Lakers to the finals against the Celtics,
only losing Game 7 by two points because Lakers coach Bill van
Breda Kolff inexplicably kept Chamberlain on the bench down the
stretch.
</P>
<P>
   The 1970 season is remembered for Willis Reed's Game 7 miracle
in the Knicks finals win over the Lakers. What's forgotten is that
Chamberlain missed all but 12 games of the regular season with a
knee ligament injury, and he was not at top shape during the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   In 1971, Chamberlain personally carried the Lakers to the NBA
finals when injuries sidelined West and Baylor for the playoffs. In
the finals, Milwaukee and a young center named Kareem Abdul-Jabbar
beat Wilt and the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1972, Chamberlain and the Lakers had the greatest season
in NBA history a 69-13 record, the best in league history (since
broken by Michael Jordan's 1996 Bulls at 72-10); a 33-game winning
streak that still stands as the longest winning streak in pro
sports; revenge against Kareem's Bucks in the Western Conference
finals; and a NBA title in five games over the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   Chamberlain still holds more than a dozen Laker records. Most
notably, he had 30 or more rebounds in 14 games with the Lakers.
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar had 30 or more rebounds just twice. Shaquille
O'Neal is still looking for his first.

ELGIN BAYLOR RECALLS CHAMBERLAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. _ Elgin Baylor, one of the mightiest ``Davids''
in NBA history, stockpiled plenty of perspective while literally
looking up to Wilt Chamberlain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wilt would say he always felt like Goliath,'' Baylor said of
his friend, foe and former teammate, who died Tuesday. ``He was the
big guy everybody wanted to see lose. But he did a lot for the game
of basketball. He brought attention to what a big guy could do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody in the league could guard him.''
</P>
<P>
   Baylor, the Clippers' vice president of basketball operations,
was in San Jose for the team's exhibition opener vs. the Golden
State Warriors when he was told of Chamberlain's passing. Despite
knowledge that Chamberlain's health had been fading in recent
months, Baylor said the news was a shock.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wilt and I have been real close,'' he said of the Hall-of-Fame
center, who joined Baylor and Jerry West as a Laker, thanks to a
1968 trade that was expected to change the NBA's balance of power.
``He always traveled a lot, be we stayed in touch on the phone.''
</P>
<P>
   And although the miles on Baylor's knees prevented them from
sharing the on-court glory of 1972, he and Chamberlain had their
moments.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were always good friends,'' said Baylor, referring to the
days when Chamberlain mangled the record books while playing in San
Francisco and Philadelphia. ``People didn't understand black
culture back then. We were always getting debates. There always was
a lot of trashing talking back and forth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd say what we were going to do to each other out on the
court, but it was as friends.''
</P>
<P>
   When Chamberlain became his teammate, there was plenty of talk
about the Lakers trashing the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was great,'' Baylor said, ``because I figured now
we probably could win a championship.''
</P>
<P>
   But by the time Chamberlain and West led the Lakers to the title
in 1973, Baylor had retired earlier that season.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had been in our prime,'' Baylor, ``we would have won a
lot of championships.''
</P>
<P>
   Chamberlain, who left the sport with two championship rings, is
a virtual despot of the league record book.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was such a fantastic athlete,'' Baylor said of the man who
- while a track athlete at Kansas University - won the shot put,
high jump and anchored the first-place mile relay time in the Big
Eight Championships, ``that people might have taken him for granted
a little bit. He scored at will.
</P>
<P>
   ``People didn't have a greater appreciation for what he did
until later.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't take that long for Chamberlain to develop a sense for
what he could do as an athlete. There was a much-discussed fight
with Muhammad Ali that never happened and a beach volleyball fling
that did. In between, Chamberlain did everything in grand style.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's basketball that turned Chamberlain into an enduring
giant.
</P>
<P>
   ``He believed he could do anything he tried,'' Baylor said. ``On
the basketball court, he did.''

PASSING OF A GENTLE GIANT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Wilt Chamberlain's physical prowess made him
an unstoppable force between the baselines. Ironically, it also was
the source of some of his greatest emotional pain off the court
during and after his 14-year NBA career.
</P>
<P>
   Those who knew Chamberlain remember a gentle giant _ a Goliath,
with an ego to match _ but with an equally big heart that made him
vulnerable and sensitive to fans' negative perceptions of him.
</P>
<P>
   Chamberlain, who died of an apparent heart attack at age 63, was
the first of his kind, a 7-foot-1 athlete who simply dominated
opponents from 1959-73. Chamberlain's immense size evoked both fear
and admiration. He longed to be accepted and cheered, but as
longtime Lakers assistant coach Bill Bertka recalls, ``He was
always perceived as a villain.''
</P>
<P>
   ``His (biography) was called, `Goliath.' Nobody loves Goliath,''
noted Bertka, who was a Lakers scout when Chamberlain arrived in
1968. ``You had this perception that he was sometimes
unapproachable. But after he had a severe knee injury (in the
1970-71 season), he came back, and he didn't feel useful, didn't
feel as dominant. But for the first time in his life as an athlete,
he felt loved in Los Angeles by the fans.... He said, `I never
experienced that, and I really did feel excited and loved and it
stimulated me.' If there's any memory of Wilt now, that is it.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a picture few would imagine of the larger-than-life
Chamberlain. But it was a theme repeated many times Tuesday in the
wake of his death.
</P>
<P>
   Chamberlain was always stung by criticism that he wasn't as
great as Bill Russell, who won 11 championships to his two. But he
was also hurt by fans' fear of him, even by innocent jokes along
the lines of ``How's the weather up there?'' Friends said it made
him feel different, isolated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's probably the thing that most touched me,'' said
former teammate and Lakers executive Jerry West. ``He had this
bluster about him, and on the inside he was a soft guy. There were
times when we'd be on the road and he didn't have anyone to have
dinner with. And we'd have dinner in the (hotel) room together. And
we talked about a lot of things other than basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did have a soft side and he was really perplexed that
people would get on him and maybe boo him. He couldn't figure that
out because he thought he was a good guy.... I think that made him
stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   Since his retirement in 1973, Chamberlain was a reclusive
figure, surfacing only occasionally for a Lakers event _ the
reunion of the '72 championship team in 1992 (on Hearn's urging)
and the retirement of teammate Gail Goodrich's jersey number in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, Chamberlain has mostly kept a low profile, even
speaking only rarely to old friends like Bertka, West and longtime
Lakers broadcaster Chick Hearn.
</P>
<P>
   Hearn, who shops at the same Encino grocery store frequented by
Chamberlain, last saw him 12 days ago and said he ``looked fine. He
always looked fine.'' Chamberlain had continued to play volleyball,
his second sports love, and work out regularly.
</P>
<P>
   But West revealed Chamberlain had heart problems and was in need
of hip-replacement surgery, and former Lakers trainer Frank O'Neill
said Chamberlain had recently been under a cardiologist's care.
</P>
<P>
   Yet no one was prepared for the news that came Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really a sad day,'' said former teammate Tommy Hawkins,
``because you're talking about one of the incredible giants of not
only professional basketball, but sports.''
</P>
<P>
   Chamberlain was a genuine superstar in professional sports, but
he joined a Lakers team already anchored by West and Elgin Baylor.
When coach Bill Sharman convinced him to sacrifice scoring to
provide more defense and rebounding, the Lakers became champions in
1972.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a tough pill for him to swallow, but he did swallow
it,'' Hearn said. ``I found him to be not only a big man physically
but a big man as a friend.... He loved his mom, called her every
day and did all the things a good son does. I liked the man very
much.''
</P>
<P>
   So did O'Neill, the Lakers' trainer, who first met Chamberlain
in 1958. O'Neill recalls an incident when his son, Michael, was in
the Forum parking lot with a wad of certificates for free
basketball shoes, courtesy of the Lakers, that he planned to give
to friends. He was about to be mugged when Chamberlain walked up.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came over and said, `Hey ``Frank Jr.'' what's going on?'
When he spoke to him, all those guys scattered. My son felt those
guys were going to jump him and Wilt sensed it,'' O'Neill recalled.
``In a lot of different ways, he was a kind and caring individual.
A lot of people didn't know that.''

WILT'S LEGACY REMAINS WITH US
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE DILBECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ There had never been anyone like him, and most
would argue, there never has been since.
</P>
<P>
   Before Wilt Chamberlain ever stepped on an NBA floor, the
basketball world knew who he was. By the time he left it, the whole
world did.
</P>
<P>
   He was arguably the NBA's first larger-than-life figure, a giant
in the game both literally and figuratively. He was less loved,
than admired, or maybe feared; less envied that respected.
</P>
<P>
   Chamberlain brought something to basketball it had never seen
before: a dominating 7-foot-1 center who was athletic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The centers up until that time may have been big and brawny,
but they didn't have the finesse, the mobility, the speed, the
jumping ability, the array of shots,'' said former NBA star Tommy
Hawkins, now the Dodgers vice president of communications. ``Wilt
brought basketball out of the stone ages into what we consider the
modern game. Wilt was the prime mover in making basketball
showtime, with running flashy dunks, and finger rolls and fade-away
jump shots off the backboard.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did all of these things with such grace that had never been
seen from a center before.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Chamberlain was more than just a special force on the floor.
He was complex, egotistical, intelligent, opinionated. He could
speak several languages. He loved to travel the world. He once
claimed in a book to have slept with 20,000 women.
</P>
<P>
   He looked menacing with that incredible physical presence alone,
but then there was that serious look, that goatee, the aggressive
way he played the game. There was almost something threatening
about him, a man who appeared he could do almost whatever he
wished.
</P>
<P>
   Yet sportswriters who covered him called him fair, kind, honest.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the kind of guy who, if you wrote something he didn't
like, he'd call you up and discuss it with you,'' said John Hall, a
former columnist at the Los Angeles Times and Orange County
Register. ``But he did it in a very frank and fair way. There was a
big fued between Wilt and coach (Bill) van Brenda Kolff. I loved
van Brenda Kolff and always took his side. But Wilt never seemed to
really resent that, except he had a different opinion and he would
call you up and let you know, which I found refreshing.''
</P>
<P>
   When Chamberlain died Tuesday at age 63 of an apparent heart
attack in his Bel-Air home famous for a stream running through it,
Hall was stunned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he would be the last guy on Earth,'' Hall said.
``(He was) just an awesome force. He was a legend before there were
legends.''
</P>
<P>
   Chamberlain was already a basketball legend in Philadelphia at
Overbrook High School. By the time he went to Kansas, the sports
world was paying close attention. Athletes don't normally come in
7-foot-1, 275-pound frames. And he was an athlete.
</P>
<P>
   He loved track and field. He was a force at volleyball. He once
wanted to fight Ali.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he would have whupped Ali, I really do,'' said former
Los Angeles Herald-Examiner sports editor Bud Furillo, now a sports
talk host at KXPS in Palm Springs. ``Wilt was the strongest man
ever.''
</P>
<P>
   The first time Hawkins ever met Chamberlain wasn't in a
basketball game, but while a junior high jumper at Notre Dame at a
track meet. Chamberlain was a high jumper for Kansas. A 7-1 high
jumper.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first meeting against Chamberlain was in the high jump pit
at the Milwaukee Relays,'' Hawkins said. ``I'll never forget that.
I think he won that year with a leap of 6-7.''
</P>
<P>
   Hawkins would later play against him in the NBA, and with him
when Chamberlain first came to the Lakers in 1968. Hawkins said it
wasn't just the public or the media that was fascinated by
Chamberlain, but the other players.
</P>
<P>
   ``You almost looked at Wilt in terms of a certain
invincibility,'' Hawkins said. ``People thought of him as ageless,
and he thought of himself that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Chamberlain played one year with the Harlem Globetrotters before
signing with Philadelphia Warriors in the 1959 season. Hall said
that year the Warriors played an exhibition game at the new Sports
Arena and it sold out. The next year, the Lakers moved in.
</P>
<P>
   ``He brought basketball into L.A,'' Hall said.
</P>
<P>
   On the court, he was almost unstoppable. His records defy
description: a record 23,924 rebounds, a 50.4 season scoring
average in 1961-62, a record 100 points in a game, nine times
leading the league in field goal percentage, seven times in scoring
and once in assists, a four-time NBA MVP.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was just one of those fabulous players who kind of defined
sports,'' said Lakers executive vice president Jerry West, a former
teammate.
</P>
<P>
   Wherever he went, Chamberlain was a willing magnet. In an era
before television showed continuous basketball highlights and
created almost instant sensations, Chamberlain was a man and player
ahead of his time. The spotlight seemed always on him, and although
he could seem aloof, it was usually welcomed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wilt was never one to run and hide,'' Hawkins said. ``He loved
walking out there and all of the attention he got. He was Pied
Piper of life. Everywhere he went, he had people following him or
he drew a crowd. He never said he resented it. From the look on his
face, he loved it. He ate it up.''
</P>
<P>
   The attention also came from the ladies, and also usually
welcomed. His claim of having slept with 20,000 women brought
plenty of chortles but, however exaggerated, there was no doubt he
took advantage of his notoriety.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's put it this way, I think there were a lot of people very
curious about Wilt,'' Hawkins said. ``And I think Wilt was probably
the recipient of a lot of curiosity action.''
</P>
<P>
   But his enduring legacy will be what he brought to the game of
basketball, his classic duels with Bill Russell, how his impact
changed the game forever. There were other stars before
Chamberlain, but he may have been its first megastar, an incredible
physical specimen on the floor and something of an enigma off it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was such a fantastic athlete, people might have taken him
for granted,'' said Elgin Baylor, a former Lakers teammate and now
a Clippers vice president. ``People didn't have a great
appreciation for what he did until later.
</P>
<P>
   ``He scored at will. He believed he could do anything he tried.
And on the basketball court, he did.''
</P>
<P>
   Like no one before him, like no one since.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes right down to it, with all the Michael Jordan
stuff, Wilt is still the single most dominant player to play the
game,'' Hall said. ``The tremendous romance with the game started
with him, not Michael Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't the most popular guy in the world. He was the first
true Goliath. And nobody likes the giant. Everybody is out to beat
the giant.
</P>
<P>
   ``But right to the end, from start to finish, he was a great
story.'' &UR; !dlim!!end! &LR;  &QL;

THE NIGHT HE HIT 100
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By VINCENT BONSIGNORE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ There are no television highlights to look at, and
only 4,000 fans were said to have been in the arena that night 37
years ago when Wilt Chamberlain scored 100 points in one game.
</P>
<P>
   Chamberlain, who died Tuesday of an apparent heart attack at 63,
was playing for the Philadelphia Warriors. The date was March 2,
1962. The opponent was the New York Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   Amazingly, the single most dominant performance in basketball
history didn't take place in either city.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it happened in Hershey, Pa., home of the famous
chocolate bar and an overwhelmingly Amish area.
</P>
<P>
   Given the lack of coverage, the unlikely site, and the fact
that, to this day, there are disputes over how Chamberlain scored
the basket to give him 100 points, some people consider it all a
hoax.
</P>
<P>
   That's how unbelievable Chamberlain's 100-point game was.
</P>
<P>
   ``What people don't know,'' Chamberlain said in 1997, ``is that
for the six or seven games right before the 100-point game, I was
averaging over 70 points. Some people said it was inevitable that
I'd score 100.''
</P>
<P>
   Chamberlain averaged 50.4 points that year, and more than 25
rebounds while averaging 48.5 minutes per game. He played all but
eight minutes of every game the entire season.
</P>
<P>
   ``During that time he was just that much better than everybody
else,'' said Cleve Buckner, a rookie forward with the Knicks that
year. Buckner, 61, is a former basketball coach at Blair High in
Pasadena. ``The whole league knew he was going to score that (many
points) some night.''
</P>
<P>
   Chamberlain thought he scored the final basket on a dunk.
Darrall Imhoff, who was guarding him, says it was on a finger roll.
</P>
<P>
   Some players remembered the game ending moments after
Chamberlain scored the last basket, when fans stormed the court
with about 50 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   Nonsense, recalled Imoff. Joe Rulick came in for Wilt and
finished the game.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Chamberlain tried an arcade shooting game
and beat the record score on the machine by almost 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps that was an omen,'' Chamberlain said.
</P>
<P>
   It helped that New York was without starting center Phil Jordan,
who was ill. In his place was the 6-10, 225-pound Imhoff, who was
20 pounds heavier than Jordan but still much smaller than the 7-1,
275-pound Chamberlain.
</P>
<P>
   Chamberlain had 23 points in the first quarter, and was 9 of 9
from the free-throw line. His career free-throw percentage was 51.1
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was all mental,'' Chamberlain said. ``Free throws were the
most embarrassing and frustrating part of my career. In practice
I'd make them, in the game....''
</P>
<P>
   By the half, Chamberlain had 41 points, which was normal for him
that season. At that point, he was 13 of 14 from the line.
</P>
<P>
   The league-scoring record at the time was 78 _ held by
Chamberlain from earlier that season _ but that was in a triple
overtime game against the Lakers. Chamberlain also had the
regulation mark, 73, set two months earlier.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the third quarter in Hershey, Chamberlain had 69,
including 21 of 22 from the foul line.
</P>
<P>
   ``After he got it going, and they were feeding him, you knew is
was going to be hard to stop him,'' Buckner said. ``We were doing
everything _ double-teaming, triple-teaming, five men on him. He
was just hot that night, he made everything. That game he made all
his free throws. He only missed four.''
</P>
<P>
   Buckner also enjoyed a big night, scoring 33 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just one of those nights,'' Buckner said. ``Bad night
to pick for my high game.''
</P>
<P>
   Not if you were Wilt Chamberlain.

time for George W. Bush to show Pat Buchanan the door.

<P>
   VECSEY-COLUMN (Atlanta) _ Sports of The Times column on the
Mets-Braves game. By George Vecsey.
</P>
<P>
   BBN-BRAVES-MILLWOOD (Atlanta) _ Kevin Millwood is the least
heralded member of Atlanta's Big Four starting staff, primarily
because Greg Maddux, Tom Glavine and John Smoltz have been shutting
down the rest of the National League for so long. But right now,
Millwood might be the best pitcher Atlanta has. And he'll get the
nod in Game 2 on Wednesday afternoon. By Clifton Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ARATON-COLUMN (Undated) _ On the Yankees and Red Sox, who begin
their league championship series on Wednesday night. Boston won the
first World Series in this century and now, appropriately, they can
win the last one, exorcising every ghost that has accumulated
around this famously frustrated franchise. By Harvey Araton.
</P>
<P>
   BBA-REDSOX-O'LEARY (Undated) _ On Troy O'Leary, the Red Sox
outfielder who drove in seven runs with two homers in Boston's Game
5 victory over Cleveland on Monday night. By Steve Popper.
</P>
<P>
   BBA-MATCHUPS (Undated) _ Sizing up the Yankees-Red Sox series.

   WINE-YATTARNA (Nuriootpa, Australia) _ The project lasted more
than six years, and it cost at least $1 million. But it produced a
fitting white stable mate for Grange, Australia's superstar red
wine. The newcomer is called Yattarna, after an Aboriginal word
meaning ``little by little,'' and it has added new luster to the
already sterling reputation of South Australia as a world-class
producer of premium wines. (Eds: First in an En Route series.) By
R.W. Apple Jr.
</P>
<P>
   OLD-COOKBOOKS (Undated) _ Cookbooks pose an unusual problem:
Their true value can only be determined over time. I rarely refer
to cookbooks that have been published in the last couple of years.
And an informal survey of experienced home cooks, food writers,
cookbook editors and authors and bookstore owners and buyers
indicated that my experience is anything but unique. By Mark
Bittman.
</P>
<P>
   FULLY-COMMITTED (New York) _ ``Fully Committed,'' a one-man
play, has touched a nerve. Packed houses suggest that there are few
dishes tastier, for present-day New Yorkers, than the stew of
pretension, duplicity, avarice and cruelty bubbling under the lid
of a four-star Manhattan restaurant, and few spectacles funnier
than seeing themselves in hot, panting pursuit of a reservation.
Critic's Notebook by William Grimes.

vine: grape leaves. By Melissa Clark. With recipes.

sandwich: spicy grilled Cheddar. By Amy Scherber with Dorie
Greenspan.

   SIMPLE-COOKING (Undated) _ The column: Cambodianesque shrimp in
lime juice. By Mark Bittman.

   WINETALK (Undated) _ The weekly wine column: Osar, a new wine
being released in Europe now and in the U.S. this fall: an Amarone
from the Veneto region of Italy that is made with an ancient grape
called oselata. By Frank J. Prial.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DALE ROBERTSON  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
ATLANTA _ Through early May, he was more bowwow than his normal
wow. Through early May, Greg Maddux deserved to answer to
``Doggie.''
<TEXT>
<P>
   Suddenly, the best pitcher of the decade was all bark and no
bite.
</P>
<P>
   People blamed, or credited, the umpires. They said Maddux
finally was being made to throw the ball over the plate for strikes
to be called. Given how he always had ``shaded'' the corners, or at
least been given the benefit of the doubt regarding same, it was
feared in Atlanta the Maddux magic had been exposed. The master
illusionist, whose 88-mph fastball could tie a batter in knots, was
a mortal after all.
</P>
<P>
   On May 4, when the Cardinals hammered him for a worst-ever eight
earned runs, his ERA was well above 5.00 and his opponents' batting
average surpassed .350, unprecedented in the '90s. Everybody here
was worried sick. He had to be hurt _ or washed up.
</P>
<P>
   He issued denials on both counts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's execution,'' he said. ``That's it, nothing else. I'm just
getting hit. I'm making 20 mistakes a game, instead of 10 to 15.
But I feel fine. Really.''
</P>
<P>
   Maddux persevered. His reservoir of confidence gave him more
resilience than ordinary arms possess. Although the umps stayed
tough on him, keeping the strike zone straight and narrow, he
adapted.
</P>
<P>
   By season's end, he had won 19 games and his ERA was down to
3.57, a more-than-respectable number for 99 percent of the pitchers
in the majors today. He wouldn't beat the Astros in the Division
Series opener last week, but seven subsequent days of rest _ he
pitched to one additional Astros batter, walking Craig Biggio, in
relief in Game 3 _ left Maddux ready for the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   Who, it seems, weren't quite ready for Maddux despite having
rocked him pretty good in their most recent encounter.
</P>
<P>
   This was only the Mets' fifth playoff game of the '90s. It was
his 20th. Different season, October.
</P>
<P>
   The Greg Maddux who gave up but five hits and one run over seven
throwback innings Tuesday night was pretty darn close to the same
Greg Maddux who went 126-49 with a 2.05 ERA over 1,636 innings from
late in the 1991 season through mid-August last year, a
historically remarkable span that included his winning an
unprecedented four Cy Young Awards successively.
</P>
<P>
   Maddux's mastery of the Mets, easily the most significant aspect
of Atlanta's 4-2 National League Championship Series-opening
victory, was a beautiful thing to observe. Unless you were a Met.
He left the Amazins amazed.
</P>
<P>
   A pity so many Atlantans missed it. The paid gate of 44,172 was
about 6,000 shy of a sellout. Maddux and his teammates clearly have
spoiled the locals by making the NLCS a virtual extension of their
regular season since '91. Why fork over $45 for the ``cheap''
seats, which were $11 for the first round, when the Braves go this
far every year?
</P>
<P>
   Maddux, that's why. Wouldn't you pay $45 to watch Monet or
Picasso paint? Genius is always worth the price of admission.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't own all those trophies because he's lucky,'' Mets
manager Bobby Valentine said. ``He made good pitches when he had
to. He did a good job, a very good job.''
</P>
<P>
   Among modern pitchers, only lefthander Sandy Koufax owns
statistics that arguably surpass Maddux's. Among righthanders, it's
universally agreed you have to go back to the early part of the
century, to Walter Johnson, to find an equal. Maddux made himself
such an anomaly in our gopher-ball age that his travails in May _
he went 0-3 with a 6.10 ERA _ were downright shocking.
</P>
<P>
   He was roughed up for 10 or more hits in five consecutive starts
after not giving up that many even back-to-back over 351 outings.
His 37 runs allowed in his first nine starts were only two fewer
than he yielded in 28 starts in 1995, his fourth Cy Young season.
</P>
<P>
   He looked 33 going on 43. But then, just like that, he righted
himself. Buoyed by a stretch of 20 scoreless innings in late June
through early July, he finished by going 14-5 with a 2.86 ERA.
Still, his 258 hits allowed were the most of his 13-year career and
marked the first time he has given up more than one per inning
since 1990, when he called Wrigley Field home.
</P>
<P>
   Maddux has nothing left to prove, but he might feel the need to
prove it anyway. His oft-desultory performances in the NLCS (3-6,
3.96 before Tuesday) never have measured up to his remarkable
regular-season successes, but he appears to be nicely on track to
change that.
</P>
<P>
   Although, honestly, he hopes his next start will come in the
World Series, where he has posted a 1.99 ERA. Now, because of him,
the Braves find themselves one-fourth of the way there after a
disappointing two-year absence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maddux really had a great night,'' his skipper, Bobby Cox,
said. ``If Chipper (Jones) doesn't bobble the ball (in the fourth)
when (Mike) Piazza broke his bat on that ground ball, he doesn't
give up any runs. It's always good to get the first game.''
</P>
<P>
   Doggie got it, all right. The canine has his canines back.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CARLTON THOMPSON  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
ATLANTA _ It was a fairly telling sign when he retired the first
six batters he faced. The fact he was massaging the corners of the
plate with ease was another tip-off. But when he blindly stabbed a
hard-hit liner up the middle, it was pretty clear.
<TEXT>
<P>
   This was Greg Maddux's night, and there wasn't much the New York
Mets could do about it.
</P>
<P>
   Maddux pitched seven strong innings and made contributions in
the field and at the plate to lead the Atlanta Braves to a 4-2
victory in Game 1 of the National League Championship Series on
Tuesday night at Turner Field.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't have all of those trophies because he's lucky,''
Mets manager Bobby Valentine said of the Braves' four-time Cy Young
Award winner. ``He's a terrific pitcher.''
</P>
<P>
   Maddux allowed only six baserunners, made a few nice plays in
the field and perfectly executed a sacrifice bunt that led to a
run. The Mets finished with just six hits in the game _ five off
Maddux, who threw 65 percent of his pitches for strikes.
</P>
<P>
   It was a typical performance for Maddux, who is 3-1 with a 1.18
ERA in the first game of playoff series during his career.
Lefthanded reliever Mike Remlinger pitched two-thirds of a
scoreless inning, and closer John Rocker finished the game,
notching his second save of the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams spent the days leading to Tuesday trying to downplay
how the Braves manhandled the Mets during the regular season,
winning nine of 12 games. Obviously, it's not a coincidence.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves, who haven't reached the World Series since 1996,
have history on their side. The Game 1 winner of the NLCS has
advanced to the World Series 19 out of 29 times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Looking back, the Padres won the first game last year, and
they won (the NLCS),'' Braves catcher Eddie Perez said. ``Two years
ago, the Marlins won the first game, and they won everything.
Winning the first game is important. We've got our best pitcher
going tomorrow, so we'll see what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   The best-of-seven series resumes this afternoon at 3:09 p.m.
Kevin Millwood, who pitched a one-hitter against the Astros in the
Division Series, will start for the Braves. Lefthander Kenny Rogers
gets the nod for New York.
</P>
<P>
   One of the main reasons the Mets struggled to beat the Braves
during the regular season is because they couldn't contain Chipper
Jones. On Tuesday, they found their best option was simply to avoid
him. Jones walked three times, and his lineup protection _ Brian
Jordan and Ryan Klesko _ was a combined 0-for-7.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves dug a little deeper for their offense, all the way to
the seventh and eighth spots in their order, where Perez and Walt
Weiss did most of the damage. Leadoff hitter Gerald Williams also
proved to be a problem for the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   The unlikely trio combined for seven of the Braves' eight hits
and three of the four RBIs and runs scored.
</P>
<P>
   Mets starter Masato Yoshii pitched admirably for 4 innings, but
he was pitching on borrowed time after he sprained his left ankle
fielding a bunt in the fifth inning. Yoshii, who won his final five
decisions of the regular season, allowed two runs on five hits and
a pair of walks.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Yoshii) pitched his butt off,'' Valentine said. ``He made
super pitches and pitched out of jams. He was matching Greg inning
for inning.''
</P>
<P>
   As he did so often during the second half of the season,
Williams ignited the Braves' offense with a leadoff single in the
first. He stole second and scored on Bret Boone's base hit up the
middle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just trying to set an offensive rhythm for my
teammates,'' said Williams, who was 2-for-5 with an RBI and a run.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets tied the score in the fourth on Mike Piazza's
broken-bat groundout, which scored Edgardo Alfonzo from third. The
Braves took the lead for good on Williams' RBI single in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Yoshii faced three batters after injuring his ankle but
eventually was replaced by righthanded reliever Pat Mahomes, who
served up a solo homer to Perez in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a hanging slider, and I hit it pretty good,'' said
Perez, who became the Braves' primary catcher after Javy Lopez's
season-ending injury. ``I hit it with the good part of the bat. I
knew it was gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Weiss' RBI single gave the Braves an insurance run in the
eighth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was kind of a storybook night for Weiss,'' said Braves
manager Bobby Cox, who has managed in more League Championship
Series (nine) than any manager in major-league history. ``He only
played sporadically during the regular season, but he had a big
night tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Weiss, who lost his starting job when the Braves acquired Jose
Hernandez from the Cubs at the trading deadline, was a surprise
starter Tuesday. Asked if Weiss would be in the starting lineup
today, Cox said: ``I'll make out the lineup tomorrow; I'm not going
to make it out tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets didn't go down without a fight. Pinch hitter Todd
Pratt's RBI single tightened the score in the ninth, and the Mets
had the potential tying run at the plate with an out remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker won a hard-fought battle with light-hitting shortstop Rey
Ordonez, who ended the game with a ground ball to Jones.
Coincidentally, it was Jones' error that prolonged the inning for
Pratt's clutch single.
</P>
<P>
   ``We battled them to the last out,'' Valentine said.

 By MICHAEL MURPHY  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
Like most everyone else, members of the Rockets were shocked to
learn Hall of Famer Wilt Chamberlain, considered by many to be the
greatest NBA player ever, had died Tuesday.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Chamberlain died of an apparent heart attack at his home in Bel
Air, Calif., at the age of 63, stunning many in the basketball
community.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a sad thing for me,'' said the Rockets' Charles
Barkley. ``I got to know him a little bit when I was with
Philadelphia, and he was always good to me. I was in awe of him
because of how physically big he was. Wilt was just one of those
bigger-than-life personalities.''
</P>
<P>
   Everything about Chamberlain was large _ his stature, his
talent, his reputation, his accomplishments and his ego.
</P>
<P>
   But his numbers ultimately will define the 7-1, 285-pound
Chamberlain, and most of those numbers can still be found in the
NBA record book.
</P>
<P>
   The records are staggering _ most points in a game, 100; highest
single-season scoring average, 50.4; most points in a season,
4,029; highest single-season rebound average, 27.2; most rebounds
in a single game, 55; most games with 50 or more points, 118.
</P>
<P>
   The list goes on and on.
</P>
<P>
   Larger-than-life numbers for a larger-than-life personality.
Most exhibit greatness in flashes, a single game or a stretch of
great play; Chamberlain exhibited a mind-numbing level of greatness
throughout his career.
</P>
<P>
   His talent was so overwhelming, the name ``Wilt Chamberlain''
soon became synonymous with big men, as a skinny youth from Lagos,
Nigeria, soon learned when he started playing the game of
basketball in America.
</P>
<P>
   ``I first heard of Wilt Chamberlain when I came here from
Nigeria,'' said Rockets center Hakeem Olajuwon. ``Just that name _
Wilt Chamberlain. It was very distinctive. And that number _ 13
(Chamberlain's jersey number). It was also very distinctive. And
his accomplishments are distinctive, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see those numbers, and if somebody were just telling you
about it, if it wasn't part of history, you would deny it. You
would not think it is possible for someone to do what he did. To
score 50 points per game for a whole season? To score 100 in a
game? And 55 rebounds in a game? That's impossible. I cannot
imagine such things. If it was possible, I would just like to watch
the game and see how it happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``These things will never happen again, and that is what defines
his greatness. The standard has been set and will never be
equaled.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed.
</P>
<P>
   Chamberlain dominated almost everything he tackled, be it a
basketball game or a debate. But mostly he dominated basketball.
Chamberlain led the 1966-67 Philadelphia 76ers to a 68-13
regular-season record, going on to capture the NBA title, the first
for Chamberlain.
</P>
<P>
   He later did those Sixers one better, leading the 1971-72 Lakers
to a 69-13 regular-season record, going on to beat the New York
Knicks for his second NBA title.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other than Michael Jordan, Wilt was the greatest player who
ever lived,'' Barkley said. ``Just look at the numbers and the
things he did during his career that will never be equaled. I don't
think we really have an appreciation for what he accomplished,
because people never really got to see him play.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we judge great accomplishments by what won't be done
again, and Wilt did a lot of things that won't ever be done again.
He scored 100 points in a game, he averaged 50 points for a season,
he got 55 rebounds in a game _ these things are unfathomable.''
</P>
<P>
   Before his retirement in 1973, Chamberlain would win seven
straight scoring titles, 11 rebounding crowns and four Most
Valuable Player awards along with his two titles.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, Wilt Chamberlain was one of the greatest basketball
players of all time,'' said former Rocket Elvin Hayes. ``He did
whatever he wanted, whenever he wanted on the court. If you said,
`Wilt, you can't lead the league in scoring,' he'd go out and do
it. And if you said, `Wilt, you can't lead the league in assists,'
he'd go out and do that, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the type of player who could do whatever he wanted to
on the court. That's why this (his death) is so shocking. He was
always so strong and healthy-looking. When you talk about great
basketball, some people still think of Wilt Chamberlain and Bill
Russell, and I don't know if that will ever change.''

 By JOSEPH DUARTE  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
NEW YORK _ As baseball lore goes, the Boston Red Sox have
supposedly been cursed for the last 80 or so years.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But they have a chance to bury the past, beginning tonight when
the Red Sox and Yankees resume their storied rivalry in Game 1 of
the American League Championship Series at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``You couldn't have a better scenario to close out the
millennium than the Red Sox against the Yankees for the pennant,''
said New York's Jim Leyritz, who has also played for Boston during
his career.
</P>
<P>
   Boston hasn't won a World Series title since 1918. In 1920, the
Red Sox sold star pitcher/outfielder Babe Ruth _ who would only
turn out to be the greatest player ever _ to the Yankees for a
reported $100,000. Is there really a Curse of the Bambino? Well, 24
Yankees World Series titles later, the Red Sox are still reminded
of the mistake that has arguably left them baseball's most haunted
team.
</P>
<P>
   The most punishing occurrence of the last 15 years came in 1986.
The Red Sox shocked the Mets by winning the first two games of the
World Series at Shea Stadium and were one victory away from
clinching the title. But despite Boston's holding a two-run lead in
the 10th inning of Game 6, the Mets rallied and won when Mookie
Wilson poked a slow roller through the legs of Bill Buckner at
first base for an improbable 6-5 victory. The Mets won the seventh
and deciding game.
</P>
<P>
   In 1978, the Yankees overcame a 14-game Red Sox lead in July and
forced a one-game playoff at Fenway Park for the AL East title.
Bucky Dent hit a three-run homer over the Green Monster in left
field to secure the victory for the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no greater rivalry in the '70s,'' said Yankees bench
coach Don Zimmer, who once managed the Red Sox. ``Those players
hated each other. I don't think that's the feeling of today.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter that they are playing their most traditional rival for
the right to go to the World Series, the Red Sox are savoring what
has already been some surprising postseason success. Having reached
the playoffs as the AL wild-card team, Boston completed a stunning
turnaround Monday with a 12-8 victory over Cleveland, becoming the
fifth team ever to rally from an 0-2 deficit to win a best-of-five
series.
</P>
<P>
   Boston won the final three games of its Division Series with the
Indians by scores of 9-3, 23-7 and 12-8.
</P>
<P>
   ``They ought to be playing the Jets or somebody, the way they're
scoring,'' Yankees outfielder Paul O'Neill said.
</P>
<P>
   New York, however, is a clear favorite to win its third AL
pennant in four seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a source of motivation to try to prove everybody wrong.
It is obvious we are an underdog,'' said Red Sox pitcher Kent
Mercker, who will start Game 1 of the ALCS against New York's
Orlando Hernandez. ``We were an underdog against Cleveland.''
</P>
<P>
   Yankees manager Joe Torre doesn't think his club will need any
extra motivation as its biggest rivalry goes to the postseason
stage for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no speech that I could make that could get them
excited more than knowing they are going to Fenway Park and that
the Red Sox are coming here,'' Torre said. ``It has been a rivalry
back before me and before them. But I think even if they don't know
the ancient history that has these two clubs involved, I think they
have seen Bucky Dent's home run on that scoreboard more than they
wanted to, especially with my bench coach being the manager of the
Red Sox at the time. There is no question that you feel that this
is going to be something special.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   The world's biggest-selling weedkiller, the chemical glyphosate,
is facing a European ban after a confidential European Union report
showed that it also kills beneficial insects and spiders.
</P>
<P>
   A ban would be a blow to the U.S. group Monsanto, which produces
most of the world's supply, usually under the name ``Roundup.'' It
is central to the group's production of genetically engineered
seeds, as Roundup-ready seeds are able to withstand the weedkiller.
</P>
<P>
   Research at Orebro Hospital in Sweden also suggests a higher
risk of a cancer called non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in those exposed to
glyphosate.
</P>
<P>
   It has been revealed that a confidential EU report says
glyphosate should not be approved for use in Europe. EU advisers
believe more research is needed.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment each European state can decide which weedkillers
it approves, and all have approved glyphosate. But with EU
harmonization on pesticide and herbicide expected in the next two
years, advisers have begun evaluating which should be prohibited.
</P>
<P>
   The report, one of several that will form the basis of
harmonization, reviewed evidence and concluded that after
glyphosate is used on crops, ``harmful effects'' on arthropods
``cannot be excluded.'' It says the chemical should not be included
on a list of approved substances pending more study.
</P>
<P>
   David Buffin of the Pesticides Trust, which campaigns against
pesticide use, said glyphosate presented a high risk to certain
insects and spiders considered beneficial because they kill harmful
crop pests.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you are knocking off the beneficials, it may result in an
increase in the insect pests and you have to go in with a fairly
invasive insecticide,'' said Buffin.
</P>
<P>
   Monsanto said it would be ``improper'' to comment, but the
company said that the World Health Organization had said glyphosate
was not carcinogenic. &QL;

OFFENSE DOESN'T SHIRK BLAME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC coach Paul Hackett said he didn't mind that
some defensive players began to subtly criticize the offense
following its abysmal performance against Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's frustration. I don't think it's bad to get that out,''
Hackett said. ``If you don't put a loss like that behind you, a
closely fought game, it can do more damage than you realize.''
</P>
<P>
   The defense-vs.-offense issue is not likely to turn into a
conflict this early in the season, because the offense pretty much
agrees with the defense's assessment that it needs to get its act
together.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I played defense, I'd be very frustrated,'' wide receiver
Kareem Kelly said. ``We've got to turn this thing around. Right
now, we're the weak link of the team. When we get in the games, we
don't execute.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to point any fingers. I can't block for the line.
I can't throw for the quarterback. I can just worry about catching
the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more troubling for Hackett is that as USC approaches its
sixth game, it still seems in search of an identity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hoped by midseason, we would have come together and jelled,
but I haven't seen it,'' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   Back to linebacker: Sophomore Darryl Knight's experiment at
tight end has ended. This week, he moved back to his original
position of strongside linebacker. Freshman Aaron Graham has moved
back to middle linebacker after playing at strongside the first
five games.
</P>
<P>
   MacKenzie update: After Tuesday's story in the Daily News that
tailback Malaefou MacKenzie did not go to Arizona because of a team
rules violation, Hackett said there was a miscommunication between
the coaches and MacKenzie, and he left the tailback home to rest
his injured hamstring.
</P>
<P>
   Sources said MacKenzie was left home because he did not suit up
for Oregon State game, when he knew he would be held out.
</P>
<P>
   Line shuffle: With Jason Grain out with a knee injury, Zach
Wilson will start at right guard. Eric Denmon, who was out two
games with sore knees, will start at center against Notre Dame.
Hackett said he would probably start Faasea Mailo at left guard as
Donta Kendrick continues to recover from a sprained ankle.
</P>
<P>
   Fullback Chad Pierson, who has been out since the Hawaii game
with a sprained ankle, is expected to play.
</P>
<P>
   Play-calling progresses: Offensive coordinator Hue Jackson
called the plays against Arizona, although Hackett took over for
the Trojans' final series.
</P>
<P>
   Pants problem: Right before kickoff against Arizona, defensive
line coach Ed Orgeron went to sit down on the team bench and split
his pants.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking, `What do I do?''' Orgeron said.
</P>
<P>
   A USC trainer provided a solution by giving Orgeron a towel
which he wore around his waist during the game.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford game time: USC's game with Stanford on Oct. 23 at the
Coliseum will be at 12:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   It's official: The Butkus Award formally added linebacker Zeke
Moreno to its list of candidates.

<P>
   There is an abiding paradox about the politics of the United
States. It repeatedly berates other countries that fail to behave
as the U.S. thinks they should.
</P>
<P>
   And yet America repeatedly is reluctant to do as it would be
done by. It urges other countries to behave well, but reserves for
itself the right to behave badly.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Senate is to vote today (Tuesday) on the Comprehensive
Test Ban Treaty, which would ban all nuclear testing worldwide in
order to bring nuclear proliferation under control. President Bill
Clinton has signed up for it, but Congress is unsure.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition among Republicans is so strong that, if the vote
were to go ahead today, the treaty would almost certainly be
rejected. The issue could then not come up for a new vote until
2001, so the best hope for those in favor is that today's vote will
be postponed until the Republicans see sense.
</P>
<P>
   The arguments against the treaty are similar to those of the gun
lobby: good guys must be well armed, to fight off the well-armed
bad guys. Republicans fear that the test ban treaty would leave
America with one hand tied behind its back.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, the U.S. will remain well protected by its nuclear
umbrella even after ratification of the treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Testing is in any case more valuable for those who are
struggling to get on to the bottom rung of the nuclear ladder, than
it is for those who are already at the top.
</P>
<P>
   But the opponents of the treaty remain unmoved. A joint appeal
by European leaders Tony Blair, Jacques Chirac and Gerhard Schroder
in The New York Times last week had little effect. Opponents insist
that America must be ready for anything _ including more testing,
if need be.
</P>
<P>
   There is a disturbing autism about the attitude of the
naysayers, which fails to understand the stark message sent by
America's defiant non-cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   America has played a valuable role in influencing two important
non-signers, India and Pakistan, to modify their stance. In recent
months, both those countries seemed ready to sign up for the
treaty.
</P>
<P>
   China, too, had pledged to join the signatories, but now appears
to be backing away. Russia refuses to ratify until America does so.
</P>
<P>
   The delays in ratification have already had a dangerous knock-on
effect in Russia, in that the bruised Moscow military looks likely
to abandon any nuclear commitments not yet nailed down in treaties.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate rebels in Washington argue that they are making the
world a safer place. They are not. They are making it unimaginably
dangerous. &QL;

   DAVIS, CALIF. _ Things have been pretty weird around the city of
Davis ever since the local branch of the University of California
developed square tomatoes back in the 1980s. (The round ones, they
said, wasted too much space in the packing boxes).
</P>
<P>
   And lately, things have just been getting weirder. Owls have
been cited by police for noise pollution, while toads are lavished
with every kindness, notably being offered the benefits of a
custom-built tunnel to take them safely across the six-lane freeway
that cuts through the city.
</P>
<P>
   Late-night partying is frowned upon, even in student
neighborhoods; nightbirds are encouraged instead to look up into
the sky with the help of specially modified street lights that
prevent glare from interfering with the view of the stars.
</P>
<P>
   Smokers are looked down upon with a disdain usually reserved for
common criminals, while ruts and potholes are viewed by the mayor
as rather quaint. She has lobbied, so far unsuccessfully, for them
to go unrepaired to add texture to Davis's ``historic'' downtown.
</P>
<P>
   And that is not to mention some of the curious ideas still on
the drawing board. Like planting fruit trees along select downtown
streets so that the poor and the hungry would always have something
to eat. Or building a new police headquarters out of straw.
</P>
<P>
   A Midwestern newspaper once called Davis ``the weirdness center
of the world,'' but residents bristle somewhat at that definition.
Generally, the word they prefer is quirky.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quirky'' is how the city is sold to students attending UC
Davis, one of the prime agricultural research centers in the world,
who might otherwise think twice about spending the prime of their
youth stuck in California's dusty Central Valley.
</P>
<P>
   But even ``quirky'' sounds too dismissive to the ears of Mayor
Julie Partansky, originator of many of the city's stranger
ordinances and bylaws, and a true believer in the values of
environmentalism, manageable growth and general wonder at the power
of the universe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Davis should be known as a progressive, intellectual
and caring community,'' she told students at the start of the new
academic year last month. ``Does having a strong smoking ordinance
make us quirky? Does having a toad tunnel so that toads can live
make us quirky? I think it's thoughtful.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Partansky, who is 52, herself graduated from UC Davis in
1970 and never left. Having been active in Green Party politics,
she was elected to the city council in 1992 and immediately began
lobbying for her most celebrated achievement, the toad tunnel.
</P>
<P>
   It was completed a couple of years ago along with a hotel and
brew pub for the little creatures to look forward to once they have
crossed Interstate 80.
</P>
<P>
   The toads, it must be said, have not shown a great deal of
interest, and continue to get squished above ground at pretty much
the same rate as before. That's gratitude for you.
</P>
<P>
   Undeterred, Councilwoman Partansky _ she became mayor just last
year _ continued her crusade to keep shopping malls and chain
stores out of Davis, along with skateboards and smokers.
</P>
<P>
   Even by California's draconian standards, Davis is tough on
tobacco, imposing a smoking ban both inside and within 20 feet of
shops, bars, restaurants and office buildings.
</P>
<P>
   But that is nothing compared with the city's attitude to noise.
Five years ago, a woman was fined for snoring too loudly and
disturbing her neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Other offenders have since included owners of barking dogs,
fraternity boys out on the town and, last month, the proprietors of
a tree house used by local owls for late-night hooting sessions.
</P>
<P>
   A ban on gas-powered leaf blowers is in the offing, as is
after-hours scratching on university blackboards.
</P>
<P>
   It's not all thou-shalt-nots, however. Davis has commissioned
some funky sculpture, including a pair of joggers sitting in front
of the police station, and a man with eyes in his buttocks who
greets customers at an ice-cream parlor.
</P>
<P>
   Davis is justly proud of its broad array of cafes, cheap
eateries, bookshops and offbeat curiosity shops, which beat just
about anything else in the Central Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Partansky has also encouraged skaters and cyclists,
introducing special traffic lights for two-wheelers that clear the
roadways and effectively put them on an equal footing with cars.
</P>
<P>
   For her next trick, she has come up with a very British idea.
</P>
<P>
   Believing the U.S. system of four-way stop signs to be confusing
and dangerous, she wants to be the first person to introduce the
New World to the wonderful world of roundabouts. Now that's quirky
for you. &QL;

   The use of baby walkers impairs infants' physical and
intellectual development, new research shows.
</P>
<P>
   Those who are ``exercised'' in baby walkers are slower to sit
upright and crawl. They also achieve lower results on early tests
of mental and physical development when compared with other
infants.
</P>
<P>
   In Britain, it is estimated that 325,000 children _ about 50
percent of all those aged six to 18 months _ use baby walkers.
Walkers were introduced 25 years ago but have become more popular
in the Nineties.
</P>
<P>
   The devices give children who cannot crawl or walk the ability
to move around the house while sitting down with their feet in
contact with the floor. The walkers have wheels and the newer ones
have larger trays than the traditional style, which allow more room
for toys and play things.
</P>
<P>
   But research now shows that the trays restrict infants' view of
their moving legs, depriving them of visual feedback that would
help them learn how their bodies move through space.
</P>
<P>
   Walkers also prevent infants from exploring and grabbing at
things around them, which is critical to their early mental
development.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers from the State University of New York who have
published their research in the latest issue of the Journal of
Developmental and Behavioral Pediatrics, studied the early mental
and physical development of 109 infants.
</P>
<P>
   Around half had never used a walker, a third used the
newer-style walkers and the remainder used older-style walkers that
allowed infants to see their moving feet and grab at objects.
</P>
<P>
   The infants were first tested at six, nine or 12 months of age,
and again three months later, using a standard measure of physical
and mental development. Parents provided information on when the
infants achieved developmental milestones, such as crawling.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers found the newer-style walkers were the worst for
babies. On average the babies sat upright, crawled, and walked more
than five weeks later than infants who had never used one, and
three weeks later than those who had older models.
</P>
<P>
   ``Newer-style walkers lead to greater delays in physical and
mental development,'' said Dr. Roger Burton, the coauthor of the
study.
</P>
<P>
   The infants who used the newer-style walkers also had the lowest
scores on physical and mental development, scoring 12 percent worse
on mental and motor skill tests than those who had never used one.
</P>
<P>
   Those with the old-style scored 5 percent lower than those who
have never used one.
</P>
<P>
   Previous research has shown half the children who use baby
walkers are injured every year, with 4,000 babies being taken to
hospital after falling down stairs or into fires and heaters.
Others suffer head injuries when the walkers topple over. The
injuries range from concussion to broken limbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the danger factor is considered in conjunction with the
developmental data presented by our study, the risks seem to
outweigh any possible benefits of early walker exposure,'' Dr.
Burton said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Denise Kendrick from Nottingham University Medical School,
who has conducted research into baby walkers, said they should be
banned.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no evidence they help in teaching a child to walk or
in children's development,'' she said. ``Baby walkers are unsafe.
They seem to fulfill the needs of parents by keeping their children
occupied rather than offering any benefit for the child.'' &QL;

<P>
   Like a virus, the NATO bug is spreading.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the spring, we were treated to ``precision'' bombing
of ``military targets'' and to ``collateral damage,'' whose victims
were ``tragic,'' as the Alliance bombarded bridges, roadways and
power stations in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Then, within weeks, Israel caught the contagion. It bombed
bridges and roadways in Lebanon and destroyed two electricity
stations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Precision'' bombing, it said, ``military'' targets because the
Lebanese would not stop ``terrorists'' attacking Israel's
occupation troops in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   The ``collateral damage'' (11 dead, including three firemen and
a young couple driving south of Beirut) was to be regretted.
</P>
<P>
   In Iraq _ where the Anglo-American war has been going on since
December _ the air bombardments have increased. Low-level press
briefings regularly announce ``precision'' strikes against military
targets in ``response'' to Iraqi challenges of the no-fly zone.
</P>
<P>
   No matter that the ``response'' often comes two days later,
against targets miles away from the antiaircraft battery that may
have fired at American planes.
</P>
<P>
   No matter that some 127 Iraqi civilians have now been killed in
these raids.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the U.S. Air Force called them ``collateral damage.''
</P>
<P>
   And now it's the Russians who are NATO's copycats, bombing
Chechnya with ``precision,'' seeking only ``military targets'' and
``the total elimination of terrorist bases'' _ the same hopeless
aim of Israel's regular onslaughts against Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, the war is going wrong. Russians are dying,
civilians are dying, apparently by the hundred. There is some
``collateral damage,'' the Russians now admit. A ``tragedy,'' said
a Russian minister.
</P>
<P>
   Why, there's even a charred bus _ its Chechen passengers blasted
to bits by a Russian tank shell _ to parallel that other, awful bus
on the bridge at Luzane in Kosovo, its Serb and Albanian passengers
incinerated by a cruise missile.
</P>
<P>
   There are action-replays of Russian gun footage for the benefit
of television viewers. Only now are reporters getting into Chechnya
to see the truth.
</P>
<P>
   And, be sure, it's only a matter of time before Russian defense
ministry officials are abusing those journalists the same way
NATO's flacks attacked those reporters who revealed NATO's bloody
ineptitude in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   How can you blame the Israelis for ``defending'' themselves in
Lebanon, an Israeli journalist asked after his country's strike
against power stations and roadway bridges _ which followed the
Israeli wounding of a Lebanese civilian and a subsequent Hezbollah
rocket attack across the Lebanese border. ``After all, look what
NATO did.'' Quite so.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's population is as outraged at the bombings of civilian
apartment blocks in Moscow as NATO countries were at the Serb
atrocities against Kosovo Albanians. But just as NATO's bombing
campaign provoked the worst Serb atrocities _ and a humanitarian
disaster _ so Russia is now provoking a humanitarian catastrophe in
its crusade against ``Islamic terror.''
</P>
<P>
   Islamic terror. The words are carefully chosen, for what
American would object to a war against ``Islamic terror?'' What
Israeli would object to such a campaign?
</P>
<P>
   It all seems so familiar. Since NATO/Israel/Russia/the
Anglo-American air force in the Gulf never _ ever _ intend to kill
civilians, their deaths are always to be blamed upon Milosevic/the
Hezbollah/``Islamic'' rebels or Saddam.
</P>
<P>
   When you're in the air force, it's good to have clean hands. &QL;

PASSING OF A GENTLE GIANT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Fixing fourth graph, changing season of injury) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Wilt Chamberlain's physical prowess made him
an unstoppable force between the baselines. Ironically, it also was
the source of some of his greatest emotional pain off the court
during and after his 14-year NBA career.
</P>
<P>
   Those who knew Chamberlain remember a gentle giant _ a Goliath,
with an ego to match _ but with an equally big heart that made him
vulnerable and sensitive to fans' negative perceptions of him.
</P>
<P>
   Chamberlain, who died of an apparent heart attack at age 63, was
the first of his kind, a 7-foot-1 athlete who simply dominated
opponents from 1959-73. Chamberlain's immense size evoked both fear
and admiration. He longed to be accepted and cheered, but as
longtime Lakers assistant coach Bill Bertka recalls, ``He was
always perceived as a villain.''
</P>
<P>
   ``His (biography) was called, `Goliath.' Nobody loves Goliath,''
noted Bertka, who was a Lakers scout when Chamberlain arrived in
1968. ``You had this perception that he was sometimes
unapproachable. But after he had a severe knee injury (in the
1969-70 season), he came back, and he didn't feel useful, didn't
feel as dominant. But for the first time in his life as an athlete,
he felt loved in Los Angeles by the fans.... He said, `I never
experienced that, and I really did feel excited and loved and it
stimulated me.' If there's any memory of Wilt now, that is it.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a picture few would imagine of the larger-than-life
Chamberlain. But it was a theme repeated many times Tuesday in the
wake of his death.
</P>
<P>
   Chamberlain was always stung by criticism that he wasn't as
great as Bill Russell, who won 11 championships to his two. But he
was also hurt by fans' fear of him, even by innocent jokes along
the lines of ``How's the weather up there?'' Friends said it made
him feel different, isolated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's probably the thing that most touched me,'' said
former teammate and Lakers executive Jerry West. ``He had this
bluster about him, and on the inside he was a soft guy. There were
times when we'd be on the road and he didn't have anyone to have
dinner with. And we'd have dinner in the (hotel) room together. And
we talked about a lot of things other than basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did have a soft side and he was really perplexed that
people would get on him and maybe boo him. He couldn't figure that
out because he thought he was a good guy.... I think that made him
stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   Since his retirement in 1973, Chamberlain was a reclusive
figure, surfacing only occasionally for a Lakers event _ the
reunion of the '72 championship team in 1992 (on Hearn's urging)
and the retirement of teammate Gail Goodrich's jersey number in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, Chamberlain has mostly kept a low profile, even
speaking only rarely to old friends like Bertka, West and longtime
Lakers broadcaster Chick Hearn.
</P>
<P>
   Hearn, who shops at the same Encino grocery store frequented by
Chamberlain, last saw him 12 days ago and said he ``looked fine. He
always looked fine.'' Chamberlain had continued to play volleyball,
his second sports love, and work out regularly.
</P>
<P>
   But West revealed Chamberlain had heart problems and was in need
of hip-replacement surgery, and former Lakers trainer Frank O'Neill
said Chamberlain had recently been under a cardiologist's care.
</P>
<P>
   Yet no one was prepared for the news that came Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really a sad day,'' said former teammate Tommy Hawkins,
``because you're talking about one of the incredible giants of not
only professional basketball, but sports.''
</P>
<P>
   Chamberlain was a genuine superstar in professional sports, but
he joined a Lakers team already anchored by West and Elgin Baylor.
When coach Bill Sharman convinced him to sacrifice scoring to
provide more defense and rebounding, the Lakers became champions in
1972.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a tough pill for him to swallow, but he did swallow
it,'' Hearn said. ``I found him to be not only a big man physically
but a big man as a friend.... He loved his mom, called her every
day and did all the things a good son does. I liked the man very
much.''
</P>
<P>
   So did O'Neill, the Lakers' trainer, who first met Chamberlain
in 1958. O'Neill recalls an incident when his son, Michael, was in
the Forum parking lot with a wad of certificates for free
basketball shoes, courtesy of the Lakers, that he planned to give
to friends. He was about to be mugged when Chamberlain walked up.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came over and said, `Hey ``Frank Jr.'' what's going on?'
When he spoke to him, all those guys scattered. My son felt those
guys were going to jump him and Wilt sensed it,'' O'Neill recalled.
``In a lot of different ways, he was a kind and caring individual.
A lot of people didn't know that.''

WILT'S LEGACY REMAINS WITH US
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Fixing 10th graph, correcting spelling of van Breda Kolff) 
By STEVE DILBECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ There had never been anyone like him, and most
would argue, there never has been since.
</P>
<P>
   Before Wilt Chamberlain ever stepped on an NBA floor, the
basketball world knew who he was. By the time he left it, the whole
world did.
</P>
<P>
   He was arguably the NBA's first larger-than-life figure, a giant
in the game both literally and figuratively. He was less loved,
than admired, or maybe feared; less envied that respected.
</P>
<P>
   Chamberlain brought something to basketball it had never seen
before: a dominating 7-foot-1 center who was athletic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The centers up until that time may have been big and brawny,
but they didn't have the finesse, the mobility, the speed, the
jumping ability, the array of shots,'' said former NBA star Tommy
Hawkins, now the Dodgers vice president of communications. ``Wilt
brought basketball out of the stone ages into what we consider the
modern game. Wilt was the prime mover in making basketball
showtime, with running flashy dunks, and finger rolls and fade-away
jump shots off the backboard.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did all of these things with such grace that had never been
seen from a center before.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Chamberlain was more than just a special force on the floor.
He was complex, egotistical, intelligent, opinionated. He could
speak several languages. He loved to travel the world. He once
claimed in a book to have slept with 20,000 women.
</P>
<P>
   He looked menacing with that incredible physical presence alone,
but then there was that serious look, that goatee, the aggressive
way he played the game. There was almost something threatening
about him, a man who appeared he could do almost whatever he
wished.
</P>
<P>
   Yet sportswriters who covered him called him fair, kind, honest.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the kind of guy who, if you wrote something he didn't
like, he'd call you up and discuss it with you,'' said John Hall, a
former columnist at the Los Angeles Times and Orange County
Register. ``But he did it in a very frank and fair way. There was a
big fued between Wilt and coach (Bill) van Breda Kolff. I loved van
Breda Kolff and always took his side. But Wilt never seemed to
really resent that, except he had a different opinion and he would
call you up and let you know, which I found refreshing.''
</P>
<P>
   When Chamberlain died Tuesday at age 63 of an apparent heart
attack in his Bel-Air home famous for a stream running through it,
Hall was stunned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he would be the last guy on Earth,'' Hall said.
``(He was) just an awesome force. He was a legend before there were
legends.''
</P>
<P>
   Chamberlain was already a basketball legend in Philadelphia at
Overbrook High School. By the time he went to Kansas, the sports
world was paying close attention. Athletes don't normally come in
7-foot-1, 275-pound frames. And he was an athlete.
</P>
<P>
   He loved track and field. He was a force at volleyball. He once
wanted to fight Ali.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he would have whupped Ali, I really do,'' said former
Los Angeles Herald-Examiner sports editor Bud Furillo, now a sports
talk host at KXPS in Palm Springs. ``Wilt was the strongest man
ever.''
</P>
<P>
   The first time Hawkins ever met Chamberlain wasn't in a
basketball game, but while a junior high jumper at Notre Dame at a
track meet. Chamberlain was a high jumper for Kansas. A 7-1 high
jumper.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first meeting against Chamberlain was in the high jump pit
at the Milwaukee Relays,'' Hawkins said. ``I'll never forget that.
I think he won that year with a leap of 6-7.''
</P>
<P>
   Hawkins would later play against him in the NBA, and with him
when Chamberlain first came to the Lakers in 1968. Hawkins said it
wasn't just the public or the media that was fascinated by
Chamberlain, but the other players.
</P>
<P>
   ``You almost looked at Wilt in terms of a certain
invincibility,'' Hawkins said. ``People thought of him as ageless,
and he thought of himself that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Chamberlain played one year with the Harlem Globetrotters before
signing with Philadelphia Warriors in the 1959 season. Hall said
that year the Warriors played an exhibition game at the new Sports
Arena and it sold out. The next year, the Lakers moved in.
</P>
<P>
   ``He brought basketball into L.A,'' Hall said.
</P>
<P>
   On the court, he was almost unstoppable. His records defy
description: a record 23,924 rebounds, a 50.4 season scoring
average in 1961-62, a record 100 points in a game, nine times
leading the league in field goal percentage, seven times in scoring
and once in assists, a four-time NBA MVP.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was just one of those fabulous players who kind of defined
sports,'' said Lakers executive vice president Jerry West, a former
teammate.
</P>
<P>
   Wherever he went, Chamberlain was a willing magnet. In an era
before television showed continuous basketball highlights and
created almost instant sensations, Chamberlain was a man and player
ahead of his time. The spotlight seemed always on him, and although
he could seem aloof, it was usually welcomed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wilt was never one to run and hide,'' Hawkins said. ``He loved
walking out there and all of the attention he got. He was Pied
Piper of life. Everywhere he went, he had people following him or
he drew a crowd. He never said he resented it. From the look on his
face, he loved it. He ate it up.''
</P>
<P>
   The attention also came from the ladies, and also usually
welcomed. His claim of having slept with 20,000 women brought
plenty of chortles but, however exaggerated, there was no doubt he
took advantage of his notoriety.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's put it this way, I think there were a lot of people very
curious about Wilt,'' Hawkins said. ``And I think Wilt was probably
the recipient of a lot of curiosity action.''
</P>
<P>
   But his enduring legacy will be what he brought to the game of
basketball, his classic duels with Bill Russell, how his impact
changed the game forever. There were other stars before
Chamberlain, but he may have been its first megastar, an incredible
physical specimen on the floor and something of an enigma off it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was such a fantastic athlete, people might have taken him
for granted,'' said Elgin Baylor, a former Lakers teammate and now
a Clippers vice president. ``People didn't have a great
appreciation for what he did until later.
</P>
<P>
   ``He scored at will. He believed he could do anything he tried.
And on the basketball court, he did.''
</P>
<P>
   Like no one before him, like no one since.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes right down to it, with all the Michael Jordan
stuff, Wilt is still the single most dominant player to play the
game,'' Hall said. ``The tremendous romance with the game started
with him, not Michael Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't the most popular guy in the world. He was the first
true Goliath. And nobody likes the giant. Everybody is out to beat
the giant.
</P>
<P>
   ``But right to the end, from start to finish, he was a great
story.''

 REP. PELOSI AIMS TO BECOME TOP WOMAN IN THE HOUSE  &HT;     By MARC SANDALOW 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Convinced that Democrats are on the verge of
winning control of the House of Representatives, San Francisco Rep.
Nancy Pelosi is aggressively pursuing a post that would make her
the most powerful woman in the history of the House.
</P>
<P>
   Pelosi, who has represented San Francisco since 1987, has her
sights set on the job of majority whip, the third-highest post in
the House after speaker and majority leader.
</P>
<P>
   If successful, Pelosi will reach a leadership level never before
attained by a woman in Congress and will be on a trajectory that
many believe could someday lead to being speaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``The time has come. The opportunity is there,'' Pelosi said
during an hourlong conversation in her Capitol Hill office. ``I
have been a slugger and a fighter and an advocate. ... Being in
leadership strengthens your hand in every issue you are involved
with.''
</P>
<P>
   Pelosi has been a party stalwart since 1977, when she was
Northern California chair of the state Democratic Party. As a
member of the House, she has championed causes ranging from
increasing AIDS funds and human rights in China to turning the
Presidio from an Army base into a national park.
</P>
<P>
   In scores of dinners, conversations and written exchanges over
the past few months, the 59-year-old Baltimore native has made a
vigorous appeal to her Democratic colleagues, touting her decades
of service to the party, her fund-raising prowess and her belief
that California must be represented at the highest levels.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats traditionally choose their leaders in the weeks
following the general election. Two other Democrats _ Steny Hoyer,
D-Md., and John Lewis, D-Ga. _ have indicated their intention to
seek the post. With election day still more than a year away,
Pelosi's aggressive campaign has prompted complaints that internal
fighting among Democrats might distract them from their larger goal
of retaking the House.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the early campaign seems to be paying dividends
for Pelosi _ apparently freezing the field at three and propelling
her to the head of the pack. So far, Pelosi said she has spoken to
about two-thirds of the 211 Democrats in the Congress. Although she
would not disclose how many had  &LR; promised to support her, she was
extraordinarily upbeat about her chances of winning, a view
supported by numerous independent observers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think anyone would agree that I am far and away the
front-runner,'' Pelosi said. ``If the vote were taken today for
whip, I would win.''
</P>
<P>
   Pelosi's political roots run deep. Her father, Thomas
D'Alesandro Jr., was a House member for the first six years of her
life, representing the city of Baltimore, where he would later
become mayor.
</P>
<P>
   Although her voting record places her on the party's liberal
edge, she has spent considerable time helping Democrats of all
political stripes raise money and win elections. In the last
campaign, Pelosi distributed more than $300,000 _ mostly raised in
the Bay Area _ to help fellow Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Northern California has been without a voice in the House
leadership since last year's retirement of Rep. Vic Fazio,
D-Sacramento, who served as chairman of the democratic caucus, the
party's No. 4 post. In 1976, San Francisco Rep. Phil Burton came
within a vote of becoming House Majority Leader, but was topped by
Texas' Jim Wright, who went on to become speaker.
</P>
<P>
   Pelosi's push is contingent on Democrats winning a majority of
the House in the 2000 election. Were that to happen, Minority
Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., would likely be elected speaker,
Minority Whip David Bonior, D-Mich., would presumedly move up to
majority leader, and the position of whip would be up for grabs.
</P>
<P>
   To boost the chance that Democrats regain control of the House,
Pelosi has created a new political action committee she calls ``PAC
to the Future,'' which will distribute money in key races next
year.
</P>
<P>
   The whip's official duty is to count and deliver votes, the name
drawn from the image of using a whip to keep members in line. Over
the years, the position has evolved into a high profile platform,
used as a bully pulpit by occupants ranging from Newt Gingrich, the
retired Georgia Republican, to Tom DeLay, R-Texas, who currently
occupies the post.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a tremendously powerful position,'' said Jack Pitney, a
professor of government at the Claremont McKenna School of
Government in Los Angeles, and the author of several books on
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Pitney said it would be a ``a great advantage'' for her San
Francisco constituents. ``A member can use it as leverage. Nobody
will ignore her phone calls.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My voice would be amplified,'' Pelosi quickly acknowledges.
``You are more than a member. Anything you are interested in
becomes more important. Anything you say is important. ... You help
establish the priorities for the caucus. Your hand is greatly
strengthened.''
</P>
<P>
   Leadership posts are so limited that openings are typically the
subject of intense power struggles.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to take the opportunity when it opens,'' Pitney said.
``The stars align just right only once in many years.''
</P>
<P>
   Pelosi's pitch begins with lending a geographical balance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is, in my view, almost unthinkable that California would
not have somebody in top leadership of the Congress,'' said Pelosi,
who said she never considered the move until Fazio retired.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go home (to California) every week, and I come back here and
it's like going into a time warp,'' Pelosi said. ``We're pioneers.
It's that whole entrepreneurial spirit that is needed (in
Washington).''
</P>
<P>
   Pelosi said she is not pushing her status as the only woman in
the race, but she hears a lot about it from people around the
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is a real asset to say to people in our country,
whether they are men or women, that when the Democrats win, a woman
will be one of the top leaders of the party.''
</P>
<P>
   Each of Pelosi's competitors has his own niche.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, who represents Atlanta, is a civil rights legend, bearing
scars from beatings he suffered during protests including the famed
march alongside Martin Luther King, Jr., from Selma to Montgomery
in 1965.
</P>
<P>
   His voting record, like Pelosi's, is among the most liberal in
the House. Lewis touts his long record of social activism, his
impeccable reputation for integrity, his good relations with
liberals and conservatives alike, and the need for a minority face
among the party's leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``The leadership should be a reflection of the makeup and the
Democratic Party and the country,'' Lewis said in an interview.
``Right now, the ... leadership is all white.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoyer, whose Maryland district stretches from the Washington
suburbs to Chesapeake Bay, served as chairman of the Democratic
Caucus _ the House's fourth-highest position _ and has long been
regarded as a rising star within the party. Hoyer was defeated by
Bonior in a race for whip in 1991. Hoyer's voting record is not as
liberal as Pelosi or Lewis, making him more appealing to some of
the party's more conservative members.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever prevails will immediately be thought of as a potential
future speaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you are whip, you have a clear shot at being
speaker,'' said Rep. Bob Matsui, D-Sacramento, who along with most
of the 28 Democrats from the state is in Pelosi's camp.
</P>
<P>
   Pelosi said she would never challenge Gephardt or Bonior, for
whom she has ``complete respect.''
</P>
<P>
   But were an opening for speaker available down the road, Pelosi
sees no reason to impose limits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't rule it out,'' she said.

A VEGETARIAN NEW YEAR'S?
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  SAN FRANCISCO _ Surf 'n' turf meets Y2K.
<P>
   As you prepare for the new millennium, fellow survivalists,
along with flashlights and water and ammo, better stock up on filet
mignon and lobster.
</P>
<P>
   In the past month, the wholesale price-per-pound of filet mignon
has jumped from $7 to $11.40, and Australian lobster tail has leapt
from $18.50 to $30. Leapin' lobsters!
</P>
<P>
   The leading theory: Giant Las Vegas casinos and many large
hotels are stockpiling the best eats for their Millennium New
Year's high-roller megabashes, driving filet mignon and lobster
prices up.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to blame them. Let's say you're signed on for the Mark
Hopkins Hotel's top New Year's package _ $16,100 for three nights
in a Garden Suite. You're probably expecting more than a Happy Meal
and fish stix.
</P>
<P>
   The rising prices probably aren't due to a shortage of cattle,
since other meat prices aren't skyrocketing. But there are only two
filets per animal and apparently they're being squirreled away in
hotel freezers for the big event.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, many restaurants are either raising prices or taking
lobster and filet mignon off their menus.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, some places refuse to be cowed, so to speak. At
John's Grill in San Francisco, the menu is set and they won't drop
the top stuff or jack up the prices.
</P>
<P>
   You get new-millennium meat at old-millennium prices.
</P>
<P>
   USE A HAMMOCK, go to jail?
</P>
<P>
   That almost became the law in Richmond last night, when the City
Council met to consider adopting the most sweeping anti-homeless
law in the Bay Area. In the face of strong arguments from homeless
advocates, the council tabled the issue for further study.
</P>
<P>
   It's called a no-camping ordinance, but it's not aimed at Boy
Scouts. The proposed law says that from 10 p.m. to 6:30 a.m., you
can't sleep in cars or motorhomes, or under overpasses.
</P>
<P>
   Also illegal: Sleeping overnight in a hammock. Apparently the
City Council wants to protect citizens from the danger of falling
coconuts.
</P>
<P>
   It's OK to be homeless in Richmond, as long as you don't sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Richmond is the city that turned down the free use of a large
building as a temporary homeless shelter because (one reason) it
didn't meet city seismic building codes, although the city doesn't
have seismic building codes.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed ordinance, which calls for jail time or fines of up
to $2,000, is backed by Richmond Mayor Rosemary Corbin. So
naturally opponents of the measure are calling it Rosemary's Baby.
</P>
<P>
   HOW BADLY do you want tickets for Opening Day of the Giants' new
ballpark next April?
</P>
<P>
   The Giants' ticket people tell me the demand is huge, and some
fans are already phoning with personal pleas. One man has a family
history of dads taking sons to Giants' openers at the Polo Grounds,
Seals Stadium and Candlestick and wants to keep the tradition
alive.
</P>
<P>
   So far, no dying-wish-type requests, but it's early.
</P>
<P>
   Tom McDonald, head of ticket sales, says the Giants could
probably sell out 41,000-seat Pac Bell Park four times for opening
day, and wouldn't that be comfy? All 81 home games might be
sellouts.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants aren't soliciting hardship stories for Opening Day
tix, and if you do have a heart-rending plea to lay on 'em, be
aware that they've heard a lot and the bar is high.
</P>
<P>
   NATURE NEWZ: It has been reported here that birds around the Bay
Area are learning to mimic the sounds of car alarms and cell
phones. Well, the birds continue to assimilate themselves into
modern civilization.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday a crowd of people gathered on Treasure Island to watch
the Blue Angels fly. During the program, a squadron of about 100
ducks appeared in the sky above the island, honking up a storm and
performing, for three or four minutes, a series of precision flying
stunts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cheered 'em,'' says Jan Faulkner.
</P>
<P>
   P-P-PLAY B-B-BALL: Game 7 of the World Series, if it's needed,
is scheduled for Halloween. If there's a rainout, we could be
watching baseball into November.
</P>
<P>
   Boys of Summer, indeed.
</P>
<P>
   CELL-U-LITES, the users of cell phones, aren't necessarily bad
people, despite what you may have read in this column.
</P>
<P>
   But can they control their habit, or do they need help? Mark
McGuire in Redwood City says he's noticing a lot of Peninsula cops
cruising in patrol cars, yakking on cells.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are the police radio systems so archaic that they have to use
cell phones?'' McGuire wonders. ``Are they calling their brokers?
Are they bored?''
</P>
<P>
   This could be one of the more visible manifestations of a
growing problem: Employees cell-phoning on company time. I saw a
garbage-truck driver the other day, parked, talking on a cell. On a
legit break, maybe. But maybe talking trash when he's supposed to
be collecting it.
</P>
<P>
   A small San Francisco ad agency named Red Ball Tiger has fired a
volley in the cell wars. Cell phone use is prohibited on company
grounds by any agency employee or visitor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has just gotten out of hand,'' says Greg Wilson, agency
founder.
</P>
<P>
   The rule at Red Ball: Check your phone at the front door. In a
pinch, employees and clients are allowed to step outside for a cell
break, so workers inside are not exposed to secondhand chit-chat.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rule was tough at first on our clients,'' says managing
director Bob Ravaiso, ``but then an amazing thing started to
happen. You would see them relax and calm down as it would sink in
that they were no longer tethered to that damn phone. Meetings
became more productive.''
</P>
<P>
   Some try to sneak cell calls in the rest rooms, but if caught,
they face loss of vacation time.

 &HT;    EUROPEAN TECH SECTOR VIBRANT, BUT HAMPERED BY HABIT AND RULES
 &HT;    720&AMP;add. Moving in (i) international and (f) financial
categories for release Sunday, Oct. 17.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MUNICH, Germany _ In the 45 years since Allied bombers and
Soviet artillery flattened its sprawling Berlin complex, Siemens AG
has emerged as a global electronics powerhouse, behind only General
Electric and IBM in overall revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Led by Siemens and Finland's Nokia, the high-tech sector of the
European economy is showing that is ready to compete with _ and in
some cases surpass _ its American rivals. But analysts say the
surge is being held back by excessive regulation, chronic high
unemployment and reluctance to abandon outdated business practices.
</P>
<P>
   Siemens executives have aggressively courted customers abroad,
to the point that 70 per cent of its business is international. The
company's stock has doubled in value since last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``After 152 years in business, we're in the process of
drastically changing our corporate culture,'' said Karl-Hermann
Baumann, who chairs Siemens' supervisory board. ``We're becoming a
lot less bureaucratic and a lot more entrepreneurial. And we're
focusing our core business increasingly on information and
communications technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Often powered by Siemens switches, Europe's 320 million people
are fast being wired up for the next millennium. Nearly a dozen
firms are laying fiber-optic networks from the Atlantic to the
Urals to offer a broader communications backbone for the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   These new networks have already had an impact on the European
market. The cost of a 10-year lease on a jumbo 155-megabit data
circuit between London and Paris has fallen from $12 million two
years ago to $2 million today.
</P>
<P>
   The new competitive wave has led in turn to declining
long-distance charges. In Germany, they have fallen to less than 10
cents a minute, comparable to the prevailing rates in the United
States. Wired customers are increasingly using price rankings
posted on the Internet to find the cheapest providers. And TV sets
in German hotel rooms now widely offer metered Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Americans are 10 years behind us in mobile technology,''
declared Erkki Liikanen(cq), the commissioner of the 15-nation
European Union (EU) who is responsible for competitiveness,
innovation and the information society.
</P>
<P>
   However, Liikanen, a Finn, acknowledged in an interview at the
EU's Brussels headquarters that ``we're behind in software and on
the Internet because our entrepreneurial environment is much more
restricted and our capacity to create small enterprises is more
limited.''
</P>
<P>
   Typically, he said, it takes 11 weeks in Europe for a start-up
firm, where much of high-tech growth is occurring, to open its
doors for business, compared with a week and a half in North
America.
</P>
<P>
   The mixed picture drawn by Liikanen's analysis is borne out in a
recent market survey of more than 2,000 top European companies and
500 local government units commissioned by Cisco Systems Inc., the
computer network equipment maker, and Oracle Corp. Both U.S. firms
are both striving to expand their European sales.
</P>
<P>
   Among the findings:
</P>
<P>
   _ In contrast to the U.S. scene, fully two-fifths of top
European companies do not believe it will be necessary for them to
do business over the Internet within the next two years.
</P>
<P>
   _ Some 55 percent of their key employees lack access to E-mail,
and 60 percent do not have access to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   _ More than 30 percent of top-level executives have never had a
technology briefing at their companies, and nearly 30 percent say
they never intend to have one.
</P>
<P>
   Britain and the Scandinavian lands were among the most advanced
in adapting to the Internet, with Germany also doing well, while
France, Belgium and Italy were behind. Italian firms, however,
showed the fastest growth of the 10 nations in the survey.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the advantages of a single market _ and, for 11 EU
members, a single currency _ e-commerce across European frontiers
still lags well behind the U.S. pace. One reason is that most
European telecommunications firms charge their customers by the
minute, thereby cutting incentives for leisurely Internet trolling.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're missing a wonderful opportunity to make the single
market a reality,'' said Diana Wallis, a British member of the
European Parliament. ``Things are not moving fast enough.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Despite America' pre-eminence in much of the high-tech world,
Europe appears primed to retain its lead in mobile phone systems
for many years to come.
</P>
<P>
   A critical reason: In the early 1980s, the EU set a common
standard for all its members, known as the Global System for Mobile
Communications or GSM. Today, GSM is used in 118 countries, serving
more than 150 million subscribers, some 40 percent of all mobile
users. Notably absent from the consortium: The United States, which
still adheres to four different standards, including GSM, and
Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Finland's Nokia passed Motorola to emerge as the
world's biggest manufacturer of mobile phones, producing 41 million
of 163 million phones sold around the world.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Finland became the first country to license third-wave
operators, who offer mobile subscribers an express connection to
the Internet as well as digital high-quality secure voice lines.
Germany, Britain, Austria and the Netherlands are also preparing to
award licenses. Even with their slower second-generation
Internet-capable phones, Europeans now transmit as many as one
billion brief data messages each month.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, in Europe, unlike in North America, every mobile
number has a different area code from landline numbers, thereby
making it easier for people to know where their call is being
routed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all starting to come together,'' said Baumann, the
Siemens chairman, as he stowed his tiny company-made phone and
invited his guests to lunch. ``And one reason it's working is
because we're offering our people lifetime employability instead of
lifetime employment.''

 &HT;    EUROPEAN TECH SECTOR VIBRANT, BUT HAMPERED BY HABIT AND RULES
 &HT;    720&AMP;add. Moving in (i) international and (f) financial
categories for release Sunday, Oct. 17.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS

<TEXT>
<P>
   MUNICH, Germany _ In the 45 years since Allied bombers and
Soviet artillery flattened its sprawling Berlin complex, Siemens AG
has emerged as a global electronics powerhouse, behind only General
Electric and IBM in overall revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Led by Siemens and Finland's Nokia, the high-tech sector of the
European economy is showing that is ready to compete with _ and in
some cases surpass _ its American rivals. But analysts say the
surge is being held back by excessive regulation, chronic high
unemployment and reluctance to abandon outdated business practices.
</P>
<P>
   Siemens executives have aggressively courted customers abroad,
to the point that 70 per cent of its business is international. The
company's stock has doubled in value since last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``After 152 years in business, we're in the process of
drastically changing our corporate culture,'' said Karl-Hermann
Baumann, who chairs Siemens' supervisory board. ``We're becoming a
lot less bureaucratic and a lot more entrepreneurial. And we're
focusing our core business increasingly on information and
communications technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Often powered by Siemens switches, Europe's 320 million people
are fast being wired up for the next millennium. Nearly a dozen
firms are laying fiber-optic networks from the Atlantic to the
Urals to offer a broader communications backbone for the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   These new networks have already had an impact on the European
market. The cost of a 10-year lease on a jumbo 155-megabit data
circuit between London and Paris has fallen from $12 million two
years ago to $2 million today.
</P>
<P>
   The new competitive wave has led in turn to declining
long-distance charges. In Germany, they have fallen to less than 10
cents a minute, comparable to the prevailing rates in the United
States. Wired customers are increasingly using price rankings
posted on the Internet to find the cheapest providers. And TV sets
in German hotel rooms now widely offer metered Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Americans are 10 years behind us in mobile technology,''
declared Erkki Liikanen(cq), the commissioner of the 15-nation
European Union (EU) who is responsible for competitiveness,
innovation and the information society.
</P>
<P>
   However, Liikanen, a Finn, acknowledged in an interview at the
EU's Brussels headquarters that ``we're behind in software and on
the Internet because our entrepreneurial environment is much more
restricted and our capacity to create small enterprises is more
limited.''
</P>
<P>
   Typically, he said, it takes 11 weeks in Europe for a start-up
firm, where much of high-tech growth is occurring, to open its
doors for business, compared with a week and a half in North
America.
</P>
<P>
   The mixed picture drawn by Liikanen's analysis is borne out in a
recent market survey of more than 2,000 top European companies and
500 local government units commissioned by Cisco Systems Inc., the
computer network equipment maker, and Oracle Corp. Both U.S. firms
are both striving to expand their European sales.
</P>
<P>
   Among the findings:
</P>
<P>
   _ In contrast to the U.S. scene, fully two-fifths of top
European companies do not believe it will be necessary for them to
do business over the Internet within the next two years.
</P>
<P>
   _ Some 55 percent of their key employees lack access to E-mail,
and 60 percent do not have access to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   _ More than 30 percent of top-level executives have never had a
technology briefing at their companies, and nearly 30 percent say
they never intend to have one.
</P>
<P>
   Britain and the Scandinavian lands were among the most advanced
in adapting to the Internet, with Germany also doing well, while
France, Belgium and Italy were behind. Italian firms, however,
showed the fastest growth of the 10 nations in the survey.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the advantages of a single market _ and, for 11 EU
members, a single currency _ e-commerce across European frontiers
still lags well behind the U.S. pace. One reason is that most
European telecommunications firms charge their customers by the
minute, thereby cutting incentives for leisurely Internet trolling.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're missing a wonderful opportunity to make the single
market a reality,'' said Diana Wallis, a British member of the
European Parliament. ``Things are not moving fast enough.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Despite America' pre-eminence in much of the high-tech world,
Europe appears primed to retain its lead in mobile phone systems
for many years to come.
</P>
<P>
   A critical reason: In the early 1980s, the EU set a common
standard for all its members, known as the Global System for Mobile
Communications or GSM. Today, GSM is used in 118 countries, serving
more than 150 million subscribers, some 40 percent of all mobile
users. Notably absent from the consortium: The United States, which
still adheres to four different standards, including GSM, and
Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Finland's Nokia passed Motorola to emerge as the
world's biggest manufacturer of mobile phones, producing 41 million
of 163 million phones sold around the world.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Finland became the first country to license third-wave
operators, who offer mobile subscribers an express connection to
the Internet as well as digital high-quality secure voice lines.
Germany, Britain, Austria and the Netherlands are also preparing to
award licenses. Even with their slower second-generation
Internet-capable phones, Europeans now transmit as many as one
billion brief data messages each month.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, in Europe, unlike in North America, every mobile
number has a different area code from landline numbers, thereby
making it easier for people to know where their call is being
routed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all starting to come together,'' said Baumann, the
Siemens chairman, as he stowed his tiny company-made phone and
invited his guests to lunch. ``And one reason it's working is
because we're offering our people lifetime employability instead of
lifetime employment.''

<P>
   OK, so it doesn't look much like a love nest. No candles, no
Persian rugs, not one Barry White CD: just a drab hospital room
equipped with a Barcalounger.
</P>
<P>
   But romance _ or at least its offspring, arousal _ is what it's
all about here at the Women's Sexual Health Clinic at the Boston
University School of Medicine. This room is a testing ground for
new generations of drugs to treat women who have lost their zest
for sex _ and therefore, suggest researchers at the center, for
life.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, the drug being tested is the one already proven
wildly successful for men: Viagra. The preliminary results of this
ongoing study reveal that Viagra significantly improves sexual
response in some women.
</P>
<P>
   Clinic director Jennifer Berman and a handful of other
researchers across the country are trying to answer a question that
has puzzled humanity since Ovid first suggested onions were
aphrodisiacs: What causes passion? And _ more important to the
pharmaceutical companies investing billions in search of the answer
_ can it be bottled?
</P>
<P>
   The introduction of Pfizer's Viagra last year ushered in a
season of sexual reawakening for millions of men. If clinical
trials are successful, Viagra will eventually be made available for
women, although Pfizer has yet to announce marketing plans. In the
meantime, numerous new drugs for enhancing sexual function _ for
both men and women _ are in the pipeline.
</P>
<P>
   The competition must come up with drugs that do what Viagra does
_ increase blood flow to sex organs _ but do it better. Or they
must come up with a blockbuster pharmaceutical that does what
Viagra definitely doesn't do _ create a desire for sex, not just
the ability to have it if you already want it.
</P>
<P>
   The story of scientific progress is often the story of
serendipity, and that is certainly true with the new breed of
designer sex drugs in the works. Just as sildenafil, the active
ingredient in Viagra, began its life as a treatment for angina, so
several of the new sex drugs originally had another use entirely _
until some smart person figured out that those frequent erections
being reported by test subjects weren't just the result of youth
and good health.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the new treatments being tested are, like Viagra,
vasodilators. All strive for essentially the same end result of
increasing blood flow in the genitals. And it is thought that these
vessel dilators work in clitoral tissue just as they do in penile
tissue.
</P>
<P>
   A female version of Zonagen's Vasomax, which is trying to outdo
Viagra, is in the works. Testing of Vasofem, which may be
formulated as a vaginal suppository rather than a pill, began last
December.
</P>
<P>
   Apomorphine, another blood-vessel dilator, has been used for
years to treat tremor-causing Parkinson's disease. It turned out
that many male Parkinson's patients experienced an unexpected side
effect: improved erections. Tests on women began in July.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States 43 percent of women experience some form of
sexual dysfunction, according to a 1999 survey from the University
of Chicago, but they don't all have problems with their blood
vessels. Some have problems with their libidos. They'd rather be
doing something altogether different.
</P>
<P>
   Vasodilators like Viagra may restore physical function, but they
cannot give a woman a sex drive. That seems to be the job of
hormones. Specifically, the hormone we associate with the male sex
drive: testosterone.
</P>
<P>
   Estratest, a pill from Solvay Pharmaceuticals that combines
estrogen and a testosterone derivative, has been on the market for
more than 30 years as an alternative to standard estrogen therapy.
But along with a decrease in hot flashes, many patients were
reporting an increase in energy and sexual enjoyment. The people at
Solvay knew a good thing when they saw it.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most startling area of hormone research involves
work on PT-14, a peptide molecule derivative of a
melanocyte-stimulating hormone that's being investigated by Palatin
Technologies. In a study completed in May, PT-14 was given to 10
men with erectile dysfunction and helped nine of them. If
additional trials go well for men, testing on women should begin in
about two years.
</P>
<P>
   Vasodilators require sexual desire to create an erection or
vaginal lubrication; testosterone seems to create sexual desire. A
guy on PT-14 can be thinking about his income tax returns and still
achieve a level of tumescence that a character in a gothic romance
novel would be proud of.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that we might soon have an arsenal of pharmaceuticals
available to treat sexual dysfunction begs a question: Do we need
to medicalize yet another fact of nature, that some people don't
have as strong a sex drive as others?
</P>
<P>
   Are we using medicine to shrink diversity in the range of human
behavior? And what will we lose if everyone's alike? If Henry James
had had a vigorous sex drive, would he have only written greeting
cards?
</P>
<P>
   Certainly there is ambivalence among researchers about using
medicine for social engineering.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's something that can be done to enhance a woman's
possibility for reaching her full sexual potential, I'm all for
it,'' says sex therapist Laura Berman, who runs the Women's Sexual
Health Clinic at Boston University with her sister Jennifer. ``That
said, with drugs for sexual dysfunction, women can use them as
Band-Aids and not resolve real issues in their lives _ like abusive
relationships or body-image problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Berman also sees a risk: that men and women _ but especially
women _ may begin to have unrealistic expectations of their own
sexuality.
</P>
<P>
   Other health specialists fervently disagree.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't about medicalizing _ it's about improving our
understanding of sexuality, particularly how men's and women's
sexuality differ,'' says Marianne Legato, director of the
Partnership for Women's Health at Columbia University in New York.
``We're on a quest for real information about female sexuality. For
the most part, sexuality has only been studied in men.''
</P>
<P>
   Carol Gruwell, a 43-year-old mother from Springfield, Ill., who
found that Estratest restored her libido after the removal of her
uterus and ovaries, says, ``A man gets Viagra and the news is all
over the world. But women have to fight tooth and nail for this
stuff. It aggravates me.''

 By JOSEPH D'AGNESE  
 c.1999 Discover magazine  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   A handgun is remarkably simple to operate. You pick it up, point
it and squeeze the trigger. The gun does the rest of the job. The
hammer cocks and then crashes down on the firing pin, sparking a
tiny gunpowder explosion that expels the bullet from its cartridge.
</P>
<P>
   From a technological standpoint, the process is child's play.
That's the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Children frequently handle guns, with deadly results. According
to the National Safety Council, 220 kids under the age of 14 died
in 1997 as a result of playing with guns.
</P>
<P>
   For other kids, the game of point and shoot has become an outlet
for personal rage. Ever since the shooting massacre at Columbine
High in Littleton, Colo., last spring left 14 students and one
teacher dead, many national and state legislators have confronted
gunmakers with a challenge: In a safety-conscious culture rife with
air bags and childproof medicine bottles, why can't someone design
a gun that kids can't operate?
</P>
<P>
   Congress is pressuring manufacturers to create safer guns,
childproof guns _ smart guns that fire only when an authorized user
pulls the trigger.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine: A criminal grabs a cop's gun. A child finds Daddy's
weapon in the bedroom. Neither can shoot because they don't have
the specially designed ring, bracelet or pin that electronically or
magnetically unlocks the firearm.
</P>
<P>
   Another weapon, seemingly lifted from the works of Ian Fleming,
won't fire unless the microchip sensor recognizes the user's
fingerprints.
</P>
<P>
   Such guns are not a futuristic fantasy. Make no mistake: The
technology is very much here and now and no more complicated than
popping open the garage door with a remote device.
</P>
<P>
   All engineers have to do is shrink the necessary circuitry to
fit into a gun _ and keep it working flawlessly. That's the tough
job.
</P>
<P>
   To understand why, consider dropping your cell phone or
electronic notebook out the window.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about a laptop inside of your firearm,'' says
Jonathan Mossberg, vice president of 0.F. Mossberg &AMP; Sons, the
world's largest maker of pump-action shotguns.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you know firearms, there's an amazing amount of stresses
that go on when you pull a trigger,'' explains Mossberg, who is
developing a smart shotgun. ``It's like hitting something with a
sledgehammer every time you fire it.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides the percussion, there's also smoke, heat and accumulated
residue of gun oil and gunpowder. Altogether, a gun is a most
inhospitable home for a silicon chip.
</P>
<P>
   But engineers are working around the problem. They're tucking
critical processors into insulated gun grips, away from the line of
fire.
</P>

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   A handgun is remarkably simple to operate. You pick it up, point
it and squeeze the trigger. The gun does the rest of the job. The
hammer cocks and then crashes down on the firing pin, sparking a
tiny gunpowder explosion that expels the bullet from its cartridge.
</P>
<P>
   From a technological standpoint, the process is child's play.
That's the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Children frequently handle guns, with deadly results. According
to the National Safety Council, 220 kids under the age of 14 died
in 1997 as a result of playing with guns.
</P>
<P>
   For other kids, the game of point and shoot has become an outlet
for personal rage. Ever since the shooting massacre at Columbine
High in Littleton, Colo., last spring left 14 students and one
teacher dead, many national and state legislators have confronted
gunmakers with a challenge: In a safety-conscious culture rife with
air bags and childproof medicine bottles, why can't someone design
a gun that kids can't operate?
</P>
<P>
   Congress is pressuring manufacturers to create safer guns,
childproof guns _ smart guns that fire only when an authorized user
pulls the trigger.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine: A criminal grabs a cop's gun. A child finds Daddy's
weapon in the bedroom. Neither can shoot because they don't have
the specially designed ring, bracelet or pin that electronically or
magnetically unlocks the firearm.
</P>
<P>
   Another weapon, seemingly lifted from the works of Ian Fleming,
won't fire unless the microchip sensor recognizes the user's
fingerprints.
</P>
<P>
   Such guns are not a futuristic fantasy. Make no mistake: The
technology is very much here and now and no more complicated than
popping open the garage door with a remote device.
</P>
<P>
   All engineers have to do is shrink the necessary circuitry to
fit into a gun _ and keep it working flawlessly. That's the tough
job.
</P>
<P>
   To understand why, consider dropping your cell phone or
electronic notebook out the window.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about a laptop inside of your firearm,'' says
Jonathan Mossberg, vice president of 0.F. Mossberg &AMP; Sons, the
world's largest maker of pump-action shotguns.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you know firearms, there's an amazing amount of stresses
that go on when you pull a trigger,'' explains Mossberg, who is
developing a smart shotgun. ``It's like hitting something with a
sledgehammer every time you fire it.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides the percussion, there's also smoke, heat and accumulated
residue of gun oil and gunpowder. Altogether, a gun is a most
inhospitable home for a silicon chip.
</P>
<P>
   But engineers are working around the problem. They're tucking
critical processors into insulated gun grips, away from the line of
fire.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of a semiautomatic pistol, that space normally
houses a magazine clip full of bullets. So the chips must be
miniaturized to fit under a gun grip's thin decorative plate _ and
still be cost-effective.
</P>
<P>
   As for power, one maker experimented with NiCad rechargeable
batteries but switched to 10-year lithiums, figuring customers
would balk charging their guns like electric shavers. No wonder one
engineer grumbles, ``Building a smart gun is a bitch.''

   ``I love food,'' Matt Damon says. ``Everything bad _ I love
pizza, beer, chocolate and spaghetti.''
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like a case for Carrie Latt Wiatt, nutritionist to the
stars.
</P>
<P>
   Wiatt, the founder of Diet Designs, is Hollywood's most
high-profile calorie counter. Her custom-made meals have been
delivered to Jennifer Aniston, Julia Roberts, Dennis Quaid, Neve
Campbell, Reese Witherspoon, James Cameron, Danny DeVito and dozens
of other Hollywood types who've needed help staying svelte between
movies.
</P>
<P>
   When Alicia Silverstone couldn't get into her catsuit for the
last ``Batman'' extravaganza, Wiatt was the one director Joel
Schumacher called on for help.
</P>
<P>
   But Wiatt's most recent coup was adding Damon to her list of
dieters. Last year, the actor packed on the pounds as he waited to
begin shooting ``The Talented Mr. Ripley.''
</P>
<P>
   Wiatt, who usually works out of an immaculate headquarters in
Culver City (complete with a stainless-steel kitchen and a staff of
nine), helped him slim down in time for the shoot. But he worried
about how he'd fare on the movie's set in Rome, surrounded by all
that pizza and pasta.
</P>
<P>
   So she hopped on a plane to Italy, toting a supply of what she
describes as Damon's ``fun food'': his favorite turkey jerky.
</P>
<P>
   Upon arrival, Wiatt instructed Italian chefs to expand their
repertoire with her low-fat meals for Damon, including creamy
polenta lasagna, crab cakes and chicken with Marbella sauce. She
also plowed her way through the city's fashionable restaurants,
where, she says, she taught Damon that he could lose weight without
being afraid of food.
</P>
<P>
   ``He could have the thin-crust pizza, but only two or three
inches,'' says the earnest but glamorous Wiatt, 41. ``Pasta, but
two or three ounces at a time. He didn't think he could eat pasta,
and all of a sudden he could.''
</P>
<P>
   Though most people would wince at the prospect of a three-inch
slice of pizza _ why even bother? _ Damon pronounces himself happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carrie helped me get through the movie,'' he says. ``I'm not a
person who diets well. She gave me food that I actually liked, and
I didn't feel like I was depriving myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is exactly Wiatt's goal. As part of her mission to teach
America that less is more, she has written a book called ``Portion
Savvy'' (Pocket Books: $24), illustrated with cardboard pop-outs of
little chicken breasts, scoops of rice, undersized apples and
minimuffins.
</P>
<P>
   Wiatt is horrified by the national obsession with super-jumbo
plates of fries, overflowing boxes of buttered popcorn, eight-ounce
bagels and 60-ounce soft drinks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where do they get the idea that we need this kind of food?''
she says. ``It's ridiculous. It's obscene.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from her skill at preparing restaurant-quality,
nutritionally balanced food in moderate but satisfying portions,
Wiatt's secret lies in tailoring her 1,000- to 2,000-calorie daily
menus to suit individual tastes.
</P>
<P>
   (An editor at W magazine who tried her food for two weeks lost
six pounds completely painlessly on a 1,600-calories-a-day regime.)
</P>
<P>
   Everything is fresh; she even refuses to go mass-market because
she doesn't want to freeze her food. And she takes into account the
dieter's sweet tooth, providing lemon bars, butterscotch chip
brownies and dainty servings of tiramisu, mousse and chocolate chip
meringues.
</P>
<P>
   Flashing the frequent smile of a true believer, Wiatt describes
herself as ``part therapist, part scientist, part motivator.''
</P>
<P>
   She schedules regular appointments with clients, asking probing
questions about eating habits, medical problems and food
preferences. Then she finishes with a weigh-in on the unforgiving
scale that looms in a corner of her otherwise cheery office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Food is so intimate, and sometimes people make it their
intimate friend and get too close,'' Wiatt moans. ``Aaargh! Think
of how we're codependent in certain relationships. They don't work.
They're dysfunctional. And why would food be any different? I can
get people to think about establishing a healthier relationship,
establishing boundaries. ''
</P>
<P>
   For people who can't stay away from their refrigerators, it
helps to have breakfast, lunch and dinner prepackaged and
delivered, because there's no need to think about eating until it's
time to open one of Wiatt's boxes.
</P>
<P>
   The meals are never predictable: There's sea bass with tamarind
sauce and couscous; corn cakes with black-bean salsa; artichoke
pizza with goat cheese. Wiatt's list goes on and on, her menu
changing to incorporate seasonal foods.
</P>
<P>
   Local clients pay $200 for the first consultation and four
follow-up visits, plus $230 a week for 15 meals. (The meals can be
shipped to some other cities at an additional charge.)
</P>
<P>
   But price is not an object for most of Wiatt's clients, who also
appreciate her cheerleader sunniness (``Oh, you're so cute,'' she
says when she's complimented on the food).
</P>
<P>
   Wiatt, who received her master's degree in nutrition from
California State University at Northridge, began her business in
her home kitchen about 15 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   At first she was cooking for friends of her parents in the San
Fernando Valley, but she'd already pick handful of
show-business clients _ including her now best buddy Sela Ward _ by
the time Ward's agent recommended her to her future husband, ICM
agent Jim Wiatt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I committed the cardinal sin _ I married my client,'' she says
with her great guffawing laugh. ``I said, `Wait a minute. I can't
date you. You're my client.' He said, `Well, I'll fire you, then.'
So he married me instead.''
</P>
<P>
   The wedding was in 1992, and the divorce came two years later,
by which time Wiatt's business had skyrocketed, fueled by her new
husband's connections.
</P>
<P>
   ``You meet people for reasons; I believe that,'' she says,
adding that, Hollywood being Hollywood, she feels ``blessed'' to
have kept most of her clients after the split.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if someone said, `Don't go to her,' people respected and
knew that I was doing a good job.'' She reflects for a minute. ``It
was an important time in my life. He was my husband. He wasn't just
an agent who introduced me to people. Would I go back and marry
someone else in the business? Not a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   In a way, however, Wiatt has gone into ``the business'' herself.
In her syndicated TV show, ``Living Better with Carrie Wiatt,'' she
visits farmers' markets and yoga classes, dispenses health and home
advice and comes across as a high-energy, low-fat Martha Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   Wiatt's own increasing celebrity has made her more aware of the
pressures that her clients have to endure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actors in the past have done some real extreme dieting and
used some very dangerous methods,'' she says. ``Everything from
diet pills in the '70s to ... I don't want to say this, but who
knows who snorted coke?''
</P>
<P>
   Wiatt also worries about ultra-thin actresses being judged too
harshly by the press.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not anorexic,'' she says. ``You'd know. Their teeth
would be gray. They'd be in the hospital. I've seen bulimics and
anorexics and they're not. I think women are becoming much more
focused on being fit and having a positive body image.''
</P>
<P>
   As a nutritionist, Wiatt's goal is to teach people her methods,
then set them free. But as much as she believes in herself, she
stops short of fanaticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are ways to cheat within the structure,'' she says.
``For me, life without chocolate would not be worth living.'' &QL;

In her syndicated TV show, ``Living Better with Carrie Wiatt,'' she
visits farmers' markets and yoga classes, dispenses health and home
advice and comes across as a high-energy, low-fat Martha Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   Wiatt's own increasing celebrity has made her more aware of the
pressures that her clients have to endure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actors in the past have done some real extreme dieting and
used some very dangerous methods,'' she says. ``Everything from
diet pills in the '70s to ... I don't want to say this, but who
knows who snorted coke?''
</P>
<P>
   Wiatt also worries about ultra-thin actresses being judged too
harshly by the press.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not anorexic,'' she says. ``You'd know. Their teeth
would be gray. They'd be in the hospital. I've seen bulimics and
anorexics and they're not. I think women are becoming much more
focused on being fit and having a positive body image.''
</P>
<P>
   As a nutritionist, Wiatt's goal is to teach people her methods,
then set them free. But as much as she believes in herself, she
stops short of fanaticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are ways to cheat within the structure,'' she says.
``For me, life without chocolate would not be worth living.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Concert renews the soul
 &HT;    By Mary McCarty
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ The old man and the old woman were in their 90s,
married 70 years. She had Alzheimer's; he was still full of verve.
And devotion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I married a beauty,'' he said. ``And she's still the most
beautiful woman in the world.'' As he leaned over to kiss her, you
could see what he meant. You could envision the young woman he
married, and see the beauty still etched in her face.
</P>
<P>
   This scene from a decade ago came back to me, oddly enough, at a
Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band concert in Chicago last
week. It was one of the closing numbers, when the band took turns
at the mike, a round robin of voices singing the verses to the
ballad If I Should Fall Behind.
</P>
<P>
   I'd always thought of the song as a hymn to enduring love:
</P>
<P>
   We said we'd walk together, baby, come what may
</P>
<P>
   That come the twilight should we lose our way
</P>
<P>
   If as we're walking a hand should slip free
</P>
<P>
   I'll wait for you
</P>
<P>
   And if I should fall behind
</P>
<P>
   Wait for me.
</P>
<P>
   I'd always thought the song was strictly about romantic love.
But it's part of the peculiar magic of a live performance that you
can see a song in a different light. Together again for the first
time in more than 10 years, this band sang the song in a way that
made you think about friendship. About all the times you fall
behind, and all the people who reach out a hand.
</P>
<P>
   They played it as an encore, side by side with a turbocharged
version of Born to Run. I smiled at the juxtaposition.
</P>
<P>
   When we are young, we sing about being born to run and born to
be wild and bad to the bone and born to be bad. We think about
charging forward, not falling behind.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not only in old age that we need a hand up.
</P>
<P>
   I thought of the friend in grade school who accepted me even
though I was afflicted with braces, nerdy glasses and excessive
piety.
</P>
<P>
   I thought of the high school religion teacher who didn't judge
my rebellion, but encouraged me to question.
</P>
<P>
   I thought of the friend who baked a lasagne and offered to
babysit when I was a new mother at the end of my rope.
</P>
<P>
   I thought of all the times I suffer a morning meltdown, and my
husband takes the punishment, bites his lip and packs the kid's
lunch.
</P>
<P>
   All those faces came before me as the familiar faces of the E
Street Band took turns at the mike. Patti Scialfa sang in her
strangely lyrical Minnie Mouse voice; Steve Van Zandt seemed moved,
even awed, to be back with this band, before these fans. The total
was greater than the sum of its parts _ the suggestion that,
through all the years and distance and difficulties, this band
would stand by each other, old friends:
</P>
<P>
   Should we lose each other in the shadow of the evening trees
</P>
<P>
   I'll wait for you
</P>
<P>
   And should I fall behind
</P>
<P>
   Wait for me.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, when I struggled for a column topic, a friend tried,
for roughly the thousandth time, to give me a hand up. ``Write
about Bruce, how you and Jim chased him around the Midwest,'' she
suggested. ``How we hang onto our youth through the music that we
grew up with.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a good idea, but it isn't nostalgia that keeps drawing me
back to this band. It's not merely music to reminisce by, but music
to grow up with.
</P>
<P>
   And to remind us, should we fall behind, of all the people
standing by to lend a hand.
</P>
<P>
   Old friends.
</P>

 &HT;    Big Guy vs. Little Guy
 &HT;    By Emily J. Minor
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The highlight of the week came on a
Wednesday when my husband rushed, not strolled, in the front door
pronouncing. ``Honey, I found cereal!'' The 8-year-old and I danced
in the kitchen. Then we sat down to spread the last of the peanut
butter on the last of the Pepperidge Farm Toasting bread and pour
the last of the milk over our new breakfast cereal .
</P>
<P>
   Trix. Not my first choice, but I'll take it. At this point, I'll
take anything.
</P>
<P>
   I know. What kind of woman am I to give my family multicolored
fruit-shaped puffs for dinner? But _ hello out there! _ that is not
the point. The point is this:
</P>
<P>
   For one week, my family did not set foot in one nationally owned
corporate mega-chain conglomerate superstore. No Eckerds. No Home
Depot. No Texaco gas.
</P>
<P>
   Allow me to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   No Blockbuster.
</P>
<P>
   No Hallmark.
</P>
<P>
   No Publix.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why?'' asked some guy I work with.
</P>
<P>
   Seven days later, I'm not so sure myself.
</P>
<P>
   The little guy. That's who Denny Grady likes to buy from. Grady
is director of the Chamber of Commerce of the Palm Beaches, and he
tries to shop at locally-owned stores. Not just to be politically
correct. That's part of it. It would be bad form to see your local
chamber guy dropping big bucks at the Big K. After all, what kind
of commerce is that promoting?
</P>
<P>
   But Grady likes the intimacy of the small stores. The clerks
know his name. If he wants his shirts folded, they'll fold them. If
he wants them on hangers, they'll do that, too. They smile. They
take his check without looking at his driver license. They trust
him.
</P>
<P>
   And he trusts them.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll say, 'Dennis, you can always get it cheaper someplace
else, but I won't sell you anything bad. I'm going to take care of
you,' '' Grady says. And he likes that.
</P>
<P>
   That's what I wanted to experience for a week. Sure, the clerk
at Publix knows who I am. Sometimes. The guy at the gas station
smiles. Sometimes. But I wanted to buy from those whose blood,
sweat and tears make their business.
</P>
<P>
   According to David Morris, vice president of the Institute for
Local Self-Reliance in Minneapolis, the demise of small business is
scary. Consider:
</P>
<P>
   _ Community pharmacies have been closing their doors at a rate
of about 1,000 per year for the past five years.
</P>
<P>
   _ In 1972, independent bookstores sold 58 percent of the
nation's books. Today, it's down to 17 percent.
</P>
<P>
   _ Almost 5 percent of the nation's retail spending belongs to
just one company: Sam Walton's Wal-Mart.
</P>
<P>
   This gives me strength as the week progresses, and we run out of
paper towels, waffle fries, frozen chicken nuggets, Shredded Wheat
cereal, Goody barrettes and Clorox.
</P>
<P>
   I'm a small-town girl. When I was growing up, I bought my dolls
from Kurtz Five &AMP; Dime in Columbiana, Ohio. My dad bought his
cigarettes at Ryan's Newsstand, and my mom bought her Wedgwood blue
paint at Keller's Hardware. We got our ice-cream cones from Ray
Candle at the Dairy Queen and bought our Ford automobiles from John
Koch's dad. We supported local business, mainly because we had no
choice.
</P>
<P>
   But today, we've got choices. Lots of them.
</P>
<P>
   If I wanted to, I could get my eyeglasses, my insulin and my Red
Delicious apples from the very same store. I could put pool toys in
my shopping cart, then a New York Times bestseller and then my
meat. And I could do all this at 3 a.m. if I wanted to.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Oct. 4., my husband and I sat at the breakfast table
with our very shopping-savvy son to explain that for one week, we
would go only into stores owned by a local person.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't go to Publix,'' I told him.
</P>
<P>
   He raised his eyebrows slightly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Or Walgreens.''
</P>
<P>
   He ate another spoonful of Shredded Wheat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Or Blockbuster, which means no Nintendo games.''
</P>
<P>
   He fainted on the floor in his best impression yet of a young
boy whose life has been ruined by his newspaper-columnist mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'll just sleep all week and save my energy since we
won't have any food,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   I told him that was fine but to be sure and dream about the
Little Guy.
</P>
<P>
   By Tuesday, I realized I'd made a huge mistake.
</P>
<P>
   I hadn't planned this right at all. I should have gone to some
place like Costco, the giant of mega-chain superstores, the night
before this started. I should have stocked up, because by Day Two
we needed apples, bread, milk, breakfast waffles and a birthday
card for Uncle Phil. Suddenly, I had an overwhelming urge to
surround myself in the white light of Bed, Bath &AMP; Beyond.
</P>
<P>
   Surely, I needed new cotton sheets? No dice.
</P>
<P>
   I got out the Yellow Pages and looked under Grocers, an
interesting exercise in social responsibility. All the little
markets near me are on streets I wrote about when I covered crime
10 years ago. I threw my liberal leanings out the window and opted
for yuppie. Jerry and Joe's Marketplace in Palm Beach Gardens. Easy
to get to. And they sell fresh flowers, too.
</P>
<P>
   I spent $71.52 at Jerry and Joe's in 24 minutes. This is the
kind of place people flock to for star fruit, designer coffee and
strawberries off season. This is not the kind of place you buy
juice boxes, Oreo cookies and Ragu spaghetti sauce.
</P>
<P>
   I went crazy. After all, I'd been deprived of all buying
pleasure for practically 48 hours. I bought apples, milk, pasta,
spaghetti sauce. I bought fresh juice and good bread. I bought
bruschetta topping, and I'm not even sure why. Isn't bruschetta
simply stale bread?
</P>
<P>
   But there were some comfort items missing from my grocery bags,
which I lugged to my truck by myself. No mosquito coils. No frozen
waffles. No Popsicles. No Maybelline lipstick. No decent breakfast
cereal. And the milk is that stuff that's ultra-pasteurized. It
doesn't go bad until the year 2001 or thereabouts.
</P>
<P>
   But here's the best part. I paid $10.09 for a jar of spaghetti
sauce. That is not a typo. It's from Rao's, a famous restaurant in
New York City. ``It's pricey,'' owner Jerry Scalisi acknowledged.
``But it's good.''
</P>
<P>
   I wouldn't know. I'm afraid to open the jar, let alone eat it.
What could be in it, for crying out loud? Streisand tickets for New
Year's Eve?
</P>
<P>
   We lasted seven days, but we were not total purists. We watched
cable television. We got our videos from a small store that isn't
owned by a corporation but is owned by some guy who lives out of
state. We bought our gas from a locally owned Chevron franchise. We
made a birthday card on the computer, but we used a Microsoft
program. You can't get any more Big Guy than that.
</P>
<P>
   But we went in little markets run by husbands and wives. We
ordered our takeout from the local pizzeria. We avoided 7-Eleven
and Blockbuster and Walgreens. We went for seven days without a
Nintendo 64 game. And, all the while, we taught a certain
8-year-old a valuable lesson: Trix cereal is really gross, even
when you wash it down with yuppie milk.

 &HT;    Couple plan to make farm refuge for the mentally ill
 &HT;    By Tom Beyerlein
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TROTWOOD, Ohio _ Margaret Gerkin has been an outspoken advocate
for the mentally ill since her son was diagnosed with paranoid
schizophrenia 13 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Now she's taking her activism to another level: She and her
husband, Jim, have ``hocked everything we own'' to purchase an
1860s farmhouse on 40 acres, and plan to use it for a special kind
of group home for the severely mentally ill and handicapped.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just heaven,'' Gerkin, 68, said of the place she calls
St. Dymphna's Farm, named for the Catholic patron saint of the
mentally ill. ``It's not going to be so much group home as
family.''
</P>
<P>
   Gerkin said the farm, on Basore Road near Hara Arena, will
provide what many formerly institutionalized mental patients need
most: a ``controlled'' but ``comfortable and loving environment.''
She said the residents will be closely supervised by trained
workers and required to take any prescribed psychotropic
medication.
</P>
<P>
   She plans to set up a trust fund so the farm can continue its
work after the she and her husband die.
</P>
<P>
   Gerkin hopes to launch the project with two residents in
December and work up to the eight allowed in the existing
3,500-square-foot house, but envisions eventually adding buildings
and housing about 50. The Gerkins are still in the process of
getting a group home license from the state. Their Community
Educational Resources for the Mentally Retarded and the Mentally
Ill has already gotten non-profit status from the Internal Revenue
Service. They mortgaged their Trotwood home to help buy the
$240,000 farm.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Hibbs, a spokesman for the Ohio Department of Mental Health,
said Gerkin shouldn't have any problems with state approval, even
for an expanded 50-patient facility, as long as the farm meets
health standards and has adequate staff.
</P>
<P>
   Trotwood's zoning code requires Gerkin to get a conditional use
permit from the Board of Zoning Appeals, said planning and zoning
administrator Steve Olmsted. But he said he'll check with
Trotwood's law director to make sure the rule doesn't conflict with
anti-discrimination laws. ``We don't want to be too restrictive or
discriminate or do anything that wouldn't stand up to a
challenge,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Trotwood planning and zoning Director Michael Lucking said
neighbors of the farm probably aren't yet aware of Gerkin's plan,
but ``to be honest with you, I can't imagine they would be real
thrilled about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gerkin said she'll plant trees as a buffer between the farm and
some adjacent homes, and the 40 acres will buffer the farm from
most of the nearby neighbors. ``We're not going to be in anybody's
face,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be a very controlled situation,'' Gerkin
said. ``They're not going to be out wandering the streets, they're
not even going to be able to walk the grounds without supervision.
I hate to use the word 'control,' but at the same time, there has
to be control in just about everything in life.''
</P>
<P>
   Residents would be referred to the farm by Eastway and Places
Inc., local gatekeepers for mental health services. The Gerkins
hope their non-profit group will be able to tap federal sources for
funding.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some people, this (farm) is going to be a dream come true,
an ideal setting,'' said Joseph Szoke, executive director of the
local mental health board. ``It's one more piece of this mosaic (of
housing opportunities) we need to have. And, God love her, she's
doing it on her own with no federal help or anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Charlotte Miller, a board member of Advocates for the Mentally
Ill, said the Gerkins are taking on a task that should be the
responsibility of the Ohio Department of Mental Health.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's trying to do what the state should have done out at Twin
Valley (Psychiatric System, formerly Dayton Mental Health
Center),'' Miller said. ``She's really putting her entire financial
life on the line here, and I admire her greatly for it. There
aren't many people who would do it.''
</P>
<P>
   The state doesn't want to build an intermediate care facility at
Twin Valley, Hibbs said, because of state law and policies aimed at
moving patients from hospitals to the community.
</P>
<P>
   The Gerkins _ she's a homemaker and he's a retired liquor store
worker and jazz musician _ didn't know much about mental illness
until their son fell ill when he was 20, 13 years ago. He is their
only surviving child _ Gerkin had seven miscarriages, and an older
son, David, was stabbed to death on July 4, 1974.
</P>
<P>
   The surviving son has been in and out of hospitals and jail over
the years, and has been committed to the Dayton state mental
hospital since 1994, when he nearly ran over a mounted police
officer, then led police on a wild chase through downtown Dayton.
His mother said he's now stable and could be conditionally released
soon. After his release, he'll live on the farm.
</P>
<P>
   Gerkin hopes to hire experienced staff members who have been
laid off from the downsized state mental health department. She
plans to provide physical and psychological therapy, supervised
outings, and activities like swimming, arts and crafts, soccer,
softball and a pool table.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many of them feel like they're not worth a whole lot,''
Gerkin said. ``I want to change that.''

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail
him at q&AMP;a(at)ajc.com
</P>
<P>
   Q: It's being widely reported that the world's population is now
6 billion. Can you give us some historical context for world
population growth?
</P>
<P>
   A: Statistics vary according to different sources, but World
Book Encyclopedia and World Almanac (1999) provide some insight. In
2000 B.C., the world's population was an estimated 108 million; in
1000 B.C., 120 million. In A.D. 1, it was an estimated 138 million
(World Book Encyclopedia) or 200 million (World Almanac). In A.D.
1000, it was 275 million. In 1650, 500 million (World Almanac) or
550 million (World Book). By 1850, it was 1 billion; 1930, 2
billion; 1975, 4 billion; 1998, 5.9 billion.
</P>
<P>
   While growth has slowed from highs of nearly 100 million people
annually, the U.N. Foundation, which tracks statistics, says global
population continues to increase rapidly _ by 77 million a year, a
rate roughly equivalent to adding a city the size of San Francisco
every three days.
</P>
<P>
   As reported, the 6 billion figure can't be definitively pinned
down to an exact date, but U.N. experts picked Oct. 12, 1999,
because it falls halfway between their predicted dates based on
low-end and high-end population estimates. Other sources say the 6
billion figure was passed in June or July.
</P>
<P>
   Information about the United Nations Foundation's population
statistics can be found online at its Web site:
www.unfoundation.org/
</P>
<P>
   Q: We often hear about the best-selling rock album, the
best-selling country music album and so on. What is the
best-selling classical music album?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``The Three Tenors in Concert'' holds the title, according to
the Guinness Book of Records (1999). Recorded by Jose Carreras,
Placido Domingo and Luciano Pavarotti for the 1990 Soccer World Cup
finals, it has sold about 13 million copies.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Announcers on televised football games frequently use the
somewhat irreverent expression ``Hail Mary'' to describe a long
forward pass. How did this come about?
</P>
<P>
   A: Our resources don't identify the first person to use the
phrase, but they offer some information of interest. One of the
earliest times it appeared in print was in 1982, in Tim Considine's
book ``The Language of Sport.'' It defined a ``Hail Mary'' as a
low-percentage pass, one that would require a great deal of luck or
the intercession of a ``higher power'' for completion. In its Aug.
13, 1990, issue, Time magazine expressed it in a different, but
easily understandable, way: ``With time running out and 80 yards to
go . . . you throw the long one and pray.''
</P>
<P>
   The phrase is sometimes used in basketball games, too, to
describe the type of shot whose only chance to go in the basket is
accompanied by devout prayer. The expression also was used in a
very different context in a 1991 press briefing by Gen. Norman
Schwarzkopf, who compared a flanking maneuver in the Persian Gulf
War to the ``desperation (football) Hail Mary.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Presidential pardons are back in the news with former
President Carter asking President Clinton to pardon Patty Hearst,
the kidnapped heiress, and Clinton pardoning some convicted Puerto
Rican terrorists. How does the pardon prodecure work? To whom does
one apply?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Office of the Pardon Attorney, the Justice Department
office responsible for processing pardon petitions on behalf of the
president, receives and reviews petitions for executive clemency,
initiates the necessary investigations, and recommends to the
president which form of executive clemency _ including pardon,
commutation of sentence, remission of fine, and reprieve _ it finds
appropriate in certain cases.

   A pardon petition is addressed to the president, but submitted
to the pardon attorney, said Chris Watney of the Justice
Department. Forms can be obtained from Office of the Pardon
Attorney, Justice Department, 4th Floor, 500 First St. NW,
Washington, DC 20530-0001) or from the wardens of any federal penal
institution. The forms explain what documentation is required.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Q&AMP;A recently reported on Rock City Gardens, the tourist
attraction on Lookout Mountain near Chattanooga, Tenn., which says
seven states are visible from there. The claim about South
Carolina, Kentucky and Virginia seems highly suspect, even on the
clearest day, for a mountain that barely rises 2,000 feet above sea
level. Can you check on this again?
</P>
<P>
   A: Officials at See Rock City have backed away from the claim,
but they do offer an explanation.
</P>
<P>
   There's no question about the ability to see Tennessee, Georgia
and Alabama. North Carolina is only 50 miles away and the Smoky
Mountains ``are fairly easy to see,'' said Lydia Thompson,
spokeswoman for the attraction. South Carolina is 80 miles away and
Mount Pinnacle, on the Virginia-Kentucky border, is 120 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   But she added: ``We cannot prove that we can see these last
three states from Lover's Leap. The truth is, we don't really know
beyond a shadow of a doubt whether all seven can be seen.''
</P>
<P>
   The phrase ``See Seven States'' finds its roots in a journal
entry by a Union soldier during the Civil War, Thompson said. The
soldier wrote that when he and some fellow soldiers went to the top
of Lookout Mountain, they could see seven states. And thus the
slogan _ true or not _ was born.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I frequently read and hear references to Jane's Fighting
Ships, always cited as an authority on military vessels. Where does
the ``Jane'' come from?
</P>
<P>
   A: It comes from Fred T. Jane, founder of a company in England
that, since 1897, has been publishing books about ships in the
world's navies and about military and civilian aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Q: There's been a lot in the news about a pay raise for people
in the military. Will retirees also get a raise?
</P>
<P>
   A: The ``99 percent answer'' for current, non-disabled military
retirees is that the legislation signed by President Clinton on
Tuesday will have no effect, said Defenfe Department spokesman Lt.
Col. Tom Begines. A ``handful'' of people with disability
retirements may get an increase, he added, but that would fall
under a system already in effect that involves increases pegged to
the Consumer Price Index. Such an increase is automatic and does
not require legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The $289 billion in defense spending authorized by the current
legislation is for fiscal 2000. The act includes a 4.8 percent pay
increase _ largest since 1981 _ for the 1.4 million men and women
in the military. Currently, starting pay for an enlisted recruit is
$889 a month, increased to $959 after four months.
</P>
<P>
   Q: In response to a question about President Carter having
awarded the Presidential Medal to Freedom to Roger Baldwin, founder
of the American Civil Liberties Union, Q&AMP;A listed the date of the
award as Jan. 16, 1981. I thought Carter was out of office by then.
Can you explain?
</P>
<P>
   A: Carter's term ended Jan. 20, 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My brother was killed on the battleship St. Paul off the
coast of Korea in April 1952. Do you know if this ship is still in
service? If not, what happened to it?
</P>
<P>
   A: It was a cruiser, hull number CA 73 _ CA designating heavy
cruiser _ and not a battleship, said John Reilly of the Navy
Historical Center. Cruisers traditionally were named after cities.
</P>
<P>
   The St. Paul was involved in a series of bombardment and other
missions off Korea and suffered a powder explosion in its forward
turret on April 21, 1952, with about 30 people killed, Reilly said.
Your brother apparently was a victim of that accident. On Jan. 28,
1980, the St. Paul was sold for scrapping to the National Metal and
Steel Corp. of Terminal Island, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly said you can find information about this particular
vessel, and many others, in the Dictionary of American Naval
Fighting Ships, a set of books published by the Navy Historical
Center. Most libraries have it, he said. Information about the St.
Paul can be found in volume 6. Information also can be found online
at www.uss-salem.org/danfs/cruisers/ and at www.history.navy.mil

<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: The new state quarters have gotten lots of publicity. Are the
old eagle quarters still being produced?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. The U.S. Mint reports that the only quarters minted for
the next decade (1999-2008) will be the 50 state quarters. But the
eagle quarters obviously will continue to be in circulation.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why does the Ku Klux Klan use crosses? Why are crosses
burned?
</P>
<P>
   A: A cross stands in every Klan den ``as a constant reminder
that Jesus Christ is our criterion of character and his teachings
our life blood, bought holy, sanctified and sublime,'' according to
the Klan Web page (www.kkk.com). It adds that the burning of a
cross is not an act of desecration, but is ``a symbol of truth,
light and obedience to God.''
</P>
<P>
   Cross-burning, of course, also is a means of intimidating ethnic
and racial minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How many American survivors of the Bataan Death March are
still living?
</P>
<P>
   A: About 1,000 survivors are still alive, said Army Maj. Richard
Gordon (ret.), spokesman for a Bataan survivors organization.
However, he points out that no records were maintained on the
infamous march on the Bataan peninsula of western Luzon in the
Philippines, and no one knows for sure even who made it. It can
only be assumed from the units who were on Bataan at its fall,
Gordon said.
</P>
<P>
   About 715 Americans died on the march, actually a series of
marches lasting from five to nine days after the surrender of the
Bataan defenders to the Japanese in April 1942. The distance a
captive had to march was determined by where on the trail the
captive began. The basic trail started with a 55-mile march from
Mariveles, Bataan, to San Fernando, Pangpanga. At San Fernando, the
prisoners were placed into train cars and were taken to Capas,
Tarlac, a distance of about 24 miles. Those who survived were
marched another 6 miles to their final destination, Camp O'Donnell.
</P>
<P>
   About 9,300 American prisoners reached O'Donnell, Gordon said.
There were just over 12,000 Americans on Bataan before its
surrender to Japanese forces.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Warren Buffett, listed by Forbes magazine as the
third-richest American with $31 billion, is about the same age as I
am. Can you trace his career for me? Did he ever serve in the
military?
</P>
<P>
   A: Buffett, who was born Aug. 30, 1930, in Omaha, Neb.,
developed his interest in making money at an early age. At 11, he
started playing the stock market with one of his two sisters.
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't in the military. After graduating from the University
of Nebraska with a B.S. in 1950, and from Columbia University in
1951 with his M.B.A, Buffet worked as an investment salesman with
Buffett, Falk and Co., his father's investment firm in Omaha, from
1951-54, and he was a security analyst under Benjamin Graham _ a
pioneer in the ``value,'' as opposed to ``growth,'' approach to
portfolio management _ at the Graham-Newman Corp. in New York from
1954-56.
</P>
<P>
   After that, Buffett returned to Omaha and formed the Buffett
Partnership, an investment firm that he managed for 13 years. He
then turned his attention to building up Berkshire Hathaway, a
Massachusetts textile firm he had bought control of in 1965. By the
time the textile business failed and was closed in 1985, Buffett
had developed Berkshire Hathaway into a profitable holding company.
You know the rest.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Airline passengers hear a message advising that, in an
emergency, oxygen masks would be released above the seats and
adults should put theirs on before putting one on a child. If only
one mask is provided per seat, what about an infant held by an
adult?
</P>
<P>
   A: On most aircraft there's an extra mask that would be released
for the use of someone with a ``lap child,'' or in case one of the
other masks wasn't functioning, said Kathleen Bergen, spokeswoman
for the Federal Aviation Administration. In a row of five seats,
for example, there would be six masks; in a row of three seats,
four masks; in a row of two seats, three masks. And as Delta
spokesman John Kennedy explained, airlines don't seat more than one
lap child in any row.
</P>
<P>
   Only infants younger than 2 can be a lap child, by the way.
Rules require that anyone 2 or older must be in a seat.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is there some way I can track down a former Army buddy?
</P>
<P>
   A: Army Public Affairs says the Privacy Act of 1974 prohibits
releasing the last known address of former Army members without
their written consent. But there's a procedure you can follow that
will assist your search by forwarding your letter to the service
member's last known address.
</P>
<P>
   First, write your letter to your buddy. Place it in a sealed and
stamped envelope, with your full name and return address. Write a
second letter to the National Personnel Records Center requesting
its assistance. Include the service member's name, serial number
and/or Social Security number, and date of birth, if available.
Place both letters in one envelope and address it to: National
Personnel Records Center, 9700 Page Blvd., St. Louis, MO
63132-5200.
</P>
<P>
   If the record center cannot identify the service member, or if
the person is known to have died, your letter will be returned.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where can fans send mail to Oprah Winfrey? She is such an
inspiration to so many of us.
</P>
<P>
   A: Write her in care of the Oprah Winfrey Show, Harpo
Productions, P.O. Box 909715, Chicago, IL 60607.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A fellow Toyota driver told me that our cars actually should
be called Toyodas, because that was the name of the man who founded
the car company. Can you confirm?
</P>
<P>
   A: Toyoda is the last name of the man who, in 1926, founded
Toyoda Automatic Loom Works in central Japan (his first name:
Sakichi). Before he died in 1930, Sakichi Toyoda sold the rights to
the loom he invented, and gave the proceeds, to his son, Kiichiro
Toyoda, to begin an auto business. It was the son who, after
splitting offthe car department from the loom works, took it
public in 1937 and changed its name to Toyota for clarity in spoken
Japanese.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Some of us were wondering if ``Chipper'' is the real first
name of Atlanta Braves star Chipper Jones. Do you know?
</P>
<P>
   A: He was named Larry Wayne Jones Jr. when he was born on April
24, 1972, in DeLand, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Some time ago, the newspaper reported on two boys, members of
an Indian tribe in Alaska, who held up a pizza delivery person. The
elders of the tribe exiled them to some remote islands. What was
the outcome?
</P>
<P>
   A: The case involved Simon Roberts and Adrian Guthrie, members
of the Tlingit tribe of southeastern Alaska. Convicted of robbing
and severely beating pizza deliveryman Tim Whittlesey in Everett,
Wash., in 1993, the two initially were permitted by Superior Court
Judge James Allendoerfer to participate in what tribal judges said
was ``traditional rehabilitation'': banishment to uninhabited
islands for 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   But the experiment in cross-cultural justice wasn't entirely
successful. Because of problems supervising the youths, along with
unauthorized visits and infighting among members of their Tlingit
tribe, Allendoerfer stopped the experiment and sent the two to
prison: 55 months for Roberts, who struck Whittlesey with a
baseball bat, and 31 months for Guthrie. They also were ordered to
pay $43,000 in restitution.
</P>
<P>
   Guthrie was released in August 1996 and Roberts was released
last December. At last report, Whittlesey, the victim, remained
partially deaf and still was suffering from memory problems.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Q&AMP;A reported recently on the difference between typhoons and
hurricanes. There was no mention of such storms occurring in the
South Atlantic or South Pacific oceans. Do they not have them?
</P>
<P>
   A: We've learned never to say ``never'' about anything, but it
would be abnormal if such storms occurred in the areas you mention.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Encyclopedia of Hurricanes, Typhoons and
Cyclones, hurricanes typically originate over the warm (84-86
degree) waters of the North Atlantic Ocean, including the Caribbean
Sea and Gulf of Mexico, and the eastern North Pacific Ocean (north
of the equator and east of the international date line).
</P>
<P>
   During the early part of the June-to-November season, hurricanes
form principally between latitudes 6 and 10 degrees north.
Late-season hurricanes primarily develop north of latitude 10
degrees north.

   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail

</P>
<P>
   Q: It's being widely reported that the world's population is now
6 billion. Can you give us some historical context for world
population growth?
</P>
<P>
   A: Statistics vary according to different sources, but World
Book Encyclopedia and World Almanac (1999) provide some insight. In
2000 B.C., the world's population was an estimated 108 million; in
1000 B.C., 120 million. In A.D. 1, it was an estimated 138 million
(World Book Encyclopedia) or 200 million (World Almanac). In A.D.
1000, it was 275 million. In 1650, 500 million (World Almanac) or
550 million (World Book). By 1850, it was 1 billion; 1930, 2
billion; 1975, 4 billion; 1998, 5.9 billion.
</P>
<P>
   While growth has slowed from highs of nearly 100 million people
annually, the U.N. Foundation, which tracks statistics, says global
population continues to increase rapidly _ by 77 million a year, a
rate roughly equivalent to adding a city the size of San Francisco
every three days.
</P>
<P>
   As reported, the 6 billion figure can't be definitively pinned
down to an exact date, but U.N. experts picked Oct. 12, 1999,
because it falls halfway between their predicted dates based on
low-end and high-end population estimates. Other sources say the 6
billion figure was passed in June or July.
</P>
<P>
   Information about the United Nations Foundation's population
statistics can be found online at its Web site:
www.unfoundation.org/
</P>
<P>
   Q: We often hear about the best-selling rock album, the
best-selling country music album and so on. What is the
best-selling classical music album?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``The Three Tenors in Concert'' holds the title, according to
the Guinness Book of Records (1999). Recorded by Jose Carreras,
Placido Domingo and Luciano Pavarotti for the 1990 Soccer World Cup
finals, it has sold about 13 million copies.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Announcers on televised football games frequently use the
somewhat irreverent expression ``Hail Mary'' to describe a long
forward pass. How did this come about?
</P>
<P>
   A: Our resources don't identify the first person to use the
phrase, but they offer some information of interest. One of the
earliest times it appeared in print was in 1982, in Tim Considine's
book ``The Language of Sport.'' It defined a ``Hail Mary'' as a
low-percentage pass, one that would require a great deal of luck or
the intercession of a ``higher power'' for completion. In its Aug.
13, 1990, issue, Time magazine expressed it in a different, but
easily understandable, way: ``With time running out and 80 yards to
go . . . you throw the long one and pray.''
</P>
<P>
   The phrase is sometimes used in basketball games, too, to
describe the type of shot whose only chance to go in the basket is
accompanied by devout prayer. The expression also was used in a
very different context in a 1991 press briefing by Gen. Norman
Schwarzkopf, who compared a flanking maneuver in the Persian Gulf
War to the ``desperation (football) Hail Mary.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Presidential pardons are back in the news with former
President Carter asking President Clinton to pardon Patty Hearst,
the kidnapped heiress, and Clinton pardoning some convicted Puerto
Rican terrorists. How does the pardon prodecure work? To whom does
one apply?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Office of the Pardon Attorney, the Justice Department
office responsible for processing pardon petitions on behalf of the
president, receives and reviews petitions for executive clemency,
initiates the necessary investigations, and recommends to the
president which form of executive clemency _ including pardon,
commutation of sentence, remission of fine, and reprieve _ it finds
appropriate in certain cases.
</P>
<P>
   A pardon petition is addressed to the president, but submitted
to the pardon attorney, said Chris Watney of the Justice
Department. Forms can be obtained from Office of the Pardon
Attorney, Justice Department, 4th Floor, 500 First St. NW,
Washington, DC 20530-0001) or from the wardens of any federal penal
institution. The forms explain what documentation is required.

<P>
   A: Buffett, who was born Aug. 30, 1930, in Omaha, Neb.,
developed his interest in making money at an early age. At 11, he
started playing the stock market with one of his two sisters.
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't in the military. After graduating from the University
of Nebraska with a B.S. in 1950, and from Columbia University in
1951 with his M.B.A, Buffet worked as an investment salesman with
Buffett, Falk and Co., his father's investment firm in Omaha, from
1951-54, and he was a security analyst under Benjamin Graham _ a
pioneer in the ``value,'' as opposed to ``growth,'' approach to
portfolio management _ at the Graham-Newman Corp. in New York from
1954-56.
</P>
<P>
   After that, Buffett returned to Omaha and formed the Buffett
Partnership, an investment firm that he managed for 13 years. He
then turned his attention to building up Berkshire Hathaway, a
Massachusetts textile firm he had bought control of in 1965. By the
time the textile business failed and was closed in 1985, Buffett
had developed Berkshire Hathaway into a profitable holding company.
You know the rest.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Airline passengers hear a message advising that, in an
emergency, oxygen masks would be released above the seats and
adults should put theirs on before putting one on a child. If only
one mask is provided per seat, what about an infant held by an
adult?
</P>
<P>
   A: On most aircraft there's an extra mask that would be released
for the use of someone with a ``lap child,'' or in case one of the
other masks wasn't functioning, said Kathleen Bergen, spokeswoman
for the Federal Aviation Administration. In a row of five seats,
for example, there would be six masks; in a row of three seats,
four masks; in a row of two seats, three masks. And as Delta
spokesman John Kennedy explained, airlines don't seat more than one
lap child in any row.
</P>
<P>
   Only infants younger than 2 can be a lap child, by the way.
Rules require that anyone 2 or older must be in a seat.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is there some way I can track down a former Army buddy?
</P>
<P>
   A: Army Public Affairs says the Privacy Act of 1974 prohibits
releasing the last known address of former Army members without
their written consent. But there's a procedure you can follow that
will assist your search by forwarding your letter to the service
member's last known address.
</P>
<P>
   First, write your letter to your buddy. Place it in a sealed and
stamped envelope, with your full name and return address. Write a
second letter to the National Personnel Records Center requesting
its assistance. Include the service member's name, serial number
and/or Social Security number, and date of birth, if available.
Place both letters in one envelope and address it to: National
Personnel Records Center, 9700 Page Blvd., St. Louis, MO
63132-5200.
</P>
<P>
   If the record center cannot identify the service member, or if
the person is known to have died, your letter will be returned.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where can fans send mail to Oprah Winfrey? She is such an
inspiration to so many of us.
</P>
<P>
   A: Write her in care of the Oprah Winfrey Show, Harpo
Productions, P.O. Box 909715, Chicago, IL 60607.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A fellow Toyota driver told me that our cars actually should
be called Toyodas, because that was the name of the man who founded
the car company. Can you confirm?
</P>
<P>
   A: Toyoda is the last name of the man who, in 1926, founded
Toyoda Automatic Loom Works in central Japan (his first name:
Sakichi). Before he died in 1930, Sakichi Toyoda sold the rights to
the loom he invented, and gave the proceeds, to his son, Kiichiro
Toyoda, to begin an auto business. It was the son who, after
splitting off the car department from the loom works, took it
public in 1937 and changed its name to Toyota for clarity in spoken
Japanese.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Some of us were wondering if ``Chipper'' is the real first
name of Atlanta Braves star Chipper Jones. Do you know?
</P>
<P>
   A: He was named Larry Wayne Jones Jr. when he was born on April
24, 1972, in DeLand, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Some time ago, the newspaper reported on two boys, members of
an Indian tribe in Alaska, who held up a pizza delivery person. The
elders of the tribe exiled them to some remote islands. What was
the outcome?
</P>
<P>
   A: The case involved Simon Roberts and Adrian Guthrie, members
of the Tlingit tribe of southeastern Alaska. Convicted of robbing
and severely beating pizza deliveryman Tim Whittlesey in Everett,
Wash., in 1993, the two initially were permitted by Superior Court
Judge James Allendoerfer to participate in what tribal judges said
was ``traditional rehabilitation'': banishment to uninhabited
islands for 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   But the experiment in cross-cultural justice wasn't entirely
successful. Because of problems supervising the youths, along with
unauthorized visits and infighting among members of their Tlingit
tribe, Allendoerfer stopped the experiment and sent the two to
prison: 55 months for Roberts, who struck Whittlesey with a
baseball bat, and 31 months for Guthrie. They also were ordered to
pay $43,000 in restitution.
</P>
<P>
   Guthrie was released in August 1996 and Roberts was released
last December. At last report, Whittlesey, the victim, remained
partially deaf and still was suffering from memory problems.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Q&AMP;A reported recently on the difference between typhoons and
hurricanes. There was no mention of such storms occurring in the
South Atlantic or South Pacific oceans. Do they not have them?
</P>
<P>
   A: We've learned never to say ``never'' about anything, but it
would be abnormal if such storms occurred in the areas you mention.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Encyclopedia of Hurricanes, Typhoons and
Cyclones, hurricanes typically originate over the warm (84-86
degree) waters of the North Atlantic Ocean, including the Caribbean
Sea and Gulf of Mexico, and the eastern North Pacific Ocean (north
of the equator and east of the international date line).
</P>
<P>
   During the early part of the June-to-November season, hurricanes
form principally between latitudes 6 and 10 degrees north.
Late-season hurricanes primarily develop north of latitude 10
degrees north.

 &HT;    Cardiologist prescribes a diet low on fat but high in excitement
 &HT;    By Meredith Moss
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ He's the only chef in America with a
whisk-o-scope.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wear it to remind people that the fight against heart
disease starts in your kitchen,'' says Dr. Richard Collins, ``the
cooking cardiologist.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins came up with the idea of combining a kitchen whisk and
stethoscope and uses his homemade gadget in cooking lectures and
demonstrations. He comes to Dayton on Thursday on behalf of
Franciscan Medical Center's Cardiac Rehabilitation Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll try to show people how they can change recipes into
something heart-healthy,'' says Collins, 55, who directs the
Alegent Heart Disease Reversal and Wellness Program at Alegent
Health Heart Institute in Omaha, Neb. He is also author of a
cookbook, The Cooking Cardiologist (Advanced Research Press,
$21.95).
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll make my favorite breakfast pudding, show people how to
use tofu, saute without oil and I'll make a fabulous lemon cream
broulee,'' says Collins, who creates recipes designed to lower
cholesterol, reduce the risk of heart disease and control weight.
</P>
<P>
   Collins admits he was raised on Midwest staples of meat and
potatoes and didn't always enjoy spending time at the stove. That
all changed six years ago when he became involved with the Dean
Ornish heart program and its strict vegetarian diet. (``If it has a
mother, you can't eat it,'' he quips.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd had a number of patients with heart disease who were
running out of options,'' Collins says. ``One had had three bypass
operations.''
</P>
<P>
   To put himself in his patients' shoes, Collins decided to try
the Ornish diet and began experimenting in his kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lost 15 pounds and I gained a lot of energy,'' he says. ``If
you have heart disease and want to stop it, it takes a major leap
(like the Ornish diet), and doing just a little bit doesn't help.
But as I started to work with the foods, I realized that if you
don't have heart disease, you don't have to give up everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``Food is an art,'' Collins says. ``Our problem in America is
that we don't love our food enough. We don't eat with awareness, we
just shove it in. If you look at Mediterranean people, they spend
more time with their food.''
</P>
<P>
   A low-fat vegetarian diet is one ingredient in a heart-healthy
lifestyle, says Collins. Others are exercise, stress reduction and
group support.
</P>
<P>
   That exercise, he adds, can be as simple as a brisk walk three
times a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``The concept in America is that if one pill is good, two is
even better,'' Collins says. ``People think if they run another
mile they are going to live longer, but studies have shown moderate
exercise is sufficient.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found that stress reduction is most important. The more you
practice stress management _ yoga, relaxation, meditation _ the
better your arteries get. The mind's control over the body is
pretty spectacular.''
</P>
<P>
   He believes cooking can be an excellent form of stress
reduction. ``When you put love and energy into food, it seems to
carry over to other people. Feeding one another is like loving one
another, it's about attachment, attention.''
</P>
<P>
   He suggests kids be involved in the cooking process, too. ``I
don't think we're teaching our children the nourishment they need
to know,'' Collins says. ``Start introducing different flavors and
textures.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, Collins is most often in the kitchen with Donna, his
wife of 33 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's refreshing to have something different to eat and have
someone help you,'' she says, adding that her husband is a lot more
creative than she is.
</P>
<P>
   ``He really experiments in the kitchen, he makes good pasta
dishes and is very creative with tofu, which we'd never eaten
before. Our cooking is very spontaneous, never planned.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins says he finds creative ways to eat at restaurants, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``At Wendy's, I get the salad bar and make my own strawberry
vinaigrette salad dressing with vinegar, a dash of pepper, some
strawberries and onions,'' he says. ``I'll add salsa and broccoli
to a baked potato.''
</P>
<P>
   Dee Schrimpf, a dietitian who works with the Ornish program
locally, says she met Collins at the Ohio Dietetic Association's
statewide meeting in Dayton six months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a wonderful repartee with the audience, a great sense
of humor and gives wonderful low-fat cooking tips,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Donna Collins notes, however, that the cooking cardiologist has
one flaw.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't clean up,'' she confides. ``Guess who does that?''
</P>
<P>

   LIFE IN AMERICA1014: Apples are the main attraction in Miami
Valley
</P>
<P>
   MORROW, Ohio _ On Maplewood Orchards in southern Warren County,
amid an enclave of trees bearing an autumn bounty of red and orange
foliage, Dixie Baker waited for children to experience a small
slice of the family's apple fields. ``This brisk air is what makes
you think of fall, of apples and hay rides,'' Baker said. The
school bus from Milford, a suburb of Cincinnati, finally arrived
and about 30 preschoolers and 15 adults poured onto the Baker's
property. Later, after tours of farming machinery, tiny hands
picked Melrose apples to munch on. The tour is a chance for the
children to get out into the country, said Lisa Robinson, a
schoolteacher. Such curiosity has turned into a worthwhile venture
for orchard growers who have used the apple and other popular
fruits, such as the pumpkin, to draw crowds. (Harris, Dayton Daily

   COOKING-CARDIOLOGIST _ He's the only chef in America with a
whisk-o-scope. ``I wear it to remind people that the fight against
heart disease starts in your kitchen,'' says Dr. Richard Collins,
``the cooking cardiologist.'' Collins came up with the idea of
combining a kitchen whisk and stethoscope and uses his homemade
gadget in cooking lectures and demonstrations. ``I'll try to show
people how they can change recipes into something heart-healthy,''
says Collins, 55, who directs the Alegent Heart Disease Reversal
and Wellness Program at Alegent Health Heart Institute in Omaha,
Neb., and author of a cookbook titled The Cooking
Cardiologist(Advanced Research Press, $21.95). (Dayton Daily News).

<P>
   &QR;  Oil holds flavors on the palate. When reducing the amount of
oil or cooking fat-free, use extra herbs and spices. Be gentle.
No-oil cooking requires lower heat and more attention.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Fat-free foods have less moisture. A trick to get fat-free
cheese to melt is to hydrate it well before melting. Marinate in
cold water, vegetable or mushroom broth for 5 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Cook with fresh and spicy condiments, flavored mustards, sweet
chutneys and ready-to-go salsas.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  When steaming vegetables, use distilled water instead of tap
water. You'll be surprised how avoiding chlorine improves the taste
of vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Saute onions or mushrooms in small amounts of frozen
concentrated apple juice to caramelize.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  When using nuts or seeds in salads, dry-roast them first to
enhance flavor. A little goes a long way.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Make cream sauces with soy milk and fat-free powdered
buttermilk, or use Butter Buds.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Use earthen bakeware with lids and just a trace of oil for
roasted root vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  When poaching fish, use a small amount of dry vermouth. It
will cut down on the fishy taste.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  When baking pizza, saute vegetables on the grill to cut down
on baking time. Use a pizza stone to prevent burning the crust.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Always have a good vegetable broth handy. Fresh or frozen
broth will make a big difference.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Cook rice, grains and beans in broth.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Thicken sauces with vegetable purees. Strained baby prunes
will thicken any rich mushroom sauce.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  When sauteing, remember just about anything will work.
Hydration is the key. You can use wine, beer, non-carbonated spring
water, frozen apple juice concentrate, even Coca Cola.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Oil sprays are handy but use them sparingly.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Make your own healthy bacon bits: Mix 1/2 cup of Grape Nuts
cereal, 1 tablespoon Liquid Smoke and 1 tablespoon of reduced-salt
soy sauce.

Valley
</P>
<P>
   MORROW, Ohio _ On Maplewood Orchards in southern Warren County,
amid an enclave of trees bearing an autumn bounty of red and orange
foliage, Dixie Baker waited for children to experience a small
slice of the family's apple fields. ``This brisk air is what makes
you think of fall, of apples and hay rides,'' Baker said. The
school bus from Milford, a suburb of Cincinnati, finally arrived
and about 30 preschoolers and 15 adults poured onto the Baker's
property. Later, after tours of farming machinery, tiny hands
picked Melrose apples to munch on. The tour is a chance for the
children to get out into the country, said Lisa Robinson, a
schoolteacher. Such curiosity has turned into a worthwhile venture
for orchard growers who have used the apple and other popular
fruits, such as the pumpkin, to draw crowds. (Harris, Dayton Daily

   TELAVI, Republic of Georgia _ Wood shavings cover the concrete
floor of the tiny workshop. The only sounds are the clang and
scrape of tools on timber as Rubiko Batiashivili goes about his
solitary work.
</P>
<P>
   With graying hair and a weathered face, Batiashivili is
virtually the last man in this sunny mountain valley who knows how
to handcraft an oaken barrel, and he is suddenly in demand. Given
the importance of wine to the economy of this former Soviet
republic, Georgia's future well-being may rest in Batiashivili's
rough hands.
</P>
<P>
   The managers of the sprawling Soviet-era Achinebuli wine factory
here in the Telavi believe they have found the innovation that will
make their product competitive in the world. The breakthrough is
wood _ not-so-high-tech wooden barrels for storing wine and
mellowing its flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Quality grapes grow in abundance is this green valley, a
winemaking region called Kakheti, in the shadow of the Caucasus
Mountains. Georgia was the Napa Valley of the tsars. Georgian wines
were prized for their flavor and clarity.
</P>
<P>
   And then came the Soviet industrial revolution. The Soviet's
built mass-production plants in the 1950s and 1960s with gigantic
steel vats that reduced prized Georgian wines to the ordinary,
though they remain popular in Russia and Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Now, hoping to revive their winemaking skills and appeal to
lucrative Western markets, Georgian vintners are tapping into past
traditions with plans to store their wine in wooden barrels and
improve its flavor and reputation worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   The Achinebuli winery, one of the country's largest, hired
Batiashivili last year after locals identified the 63-year-old
woodworker as one of the last of a dying breed. He learned the
craft of making barrels to store wine as a teenager half a century
ago, and now he is again putting the skill to work.
</P>
<P>
   He spends his days in his workshop at a corner of the winery
hewing and assembling small barrels. One day soon, he will begin
making full-sized barrels to store wine. For now, they are content
to let him practice his craft, and teach it to others.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I started, all the wineries used wooden barrels,'' said
Batiashivili. He added with a smile: ``This factory makes very good
wine, but of course my homemade wine is better.''
</P>
<P>
   Batiashivili's boastfulness is something of a national trait in
Georgia, where virtually every rural household produces its own
wine, as it has for generations.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Georgia's top wine producers want to live up to their
country's winemaking heritage.
</P>
<P>
   With the collapse of communism in 1991 and the global success of
such small wine-producing countries as Chile and Australia, the
Georgia wine industry believes it could find its niche in the world
market.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have great traditions. We used to produce very good wines.
But in the Soviet period, we were very backwards and our problem is
that our viniculture specialists don't know just how backward we
are,'' said David Dolmazashivili, director of the Achinebuli
winery.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly, the quality is improving as the winery has sent its
winemakers abroad to see how Californians, Italians and the French
harvest and produce wines.
</P>
<P>
   Over the summer, Dolmazashivili toured the California wine
regions and returned to spread the word on how far Georgia must go
to compete with the likes of Robert Mondavi wineries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now at least we know what we want and need. We cannot afford
it, but at least we know, whereas before we thought we had the
best,'' Dolmazashivili said.
</P>
<P>
   Next year, the winery will import oak barrels from California to
begin storing what will become vintage, upscale wine. In the next
batch, they hope to use homemade barrels produced by Batiashivili.
</P>
<P>
   The winery already has begun to purchase stainless steel
processing equipment from Italy to replace the worn and corroding
Soviet-era equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The parent company, Georgia Wine and Spirits, was founded in
1993 as the state-owned vineyards were being privatized, and is
responsible for about half the country's production and sales. The
French beverage multinational Pernod Richard owns a share of the
Georgia company.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the former Soviet Union, the quest to compete
globally begins with the expensive task of updating the technology.
Decades of central planning and lack of competition have left
rusting factories unable to function profitably in a market
economy.
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia, though, winemakers have the grapes and the
reputation that has seen them through the rough decade. Wine
remains one of the small country's top exports, sold mainly to
Russia and other former Soviet states.
</P>
<P>
   Yet at its peak in Soviet times, Georgia exported about 120
million bottles of wine a year. Last year, the total was only about
10 million.
</P>
<P>
   Georgian wines sell sporadically in the United States, several
thousand bottles a year primarily in New York, Los Angeles and
Chicago, where Russian immigrants maintain a miniscule but steady
demand for them.
</P>
<P>
   Earning a reputation in the West will not be easy in a crowded
market of fine wines from Europe, California, South America and
Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem facing producers in Georgia is the lack of
quality control. With some 500 varieties of grapes growing in the
country, Georgia needs establish an appellation system, similar to
France's regional controls that define in absolute terms what makes
a Burgundy, Bordeaux or Beaujolais.
</P>
<P>
   Producers agree that even Georgia's best-known varieties _ a dry
white wine called Tsinandali, similar to a Chablis, and a dry red
called Saperavi-Mukuzanik, akin to a Merlot _ suffer from widely
varying tastes depending on the winery. Georgia also grapples with
a problem of counterfeiting, claiming that illicit producers in
Russia, Ukraine, Romania and Slovakia bottle wines using Georgia
labels to exploit the good reputation.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, winemakers said, the small and poor nation needs
economic freedoms that will encourage entrepreneurs to make and
market their own vintages.
</P>
<P>
   They already exist in abundance here. Virtually every Georgian
household traditionally has a cellar of homemade wine. But few can
find the capital to develop into full-fledged wineries to bottle
and market their product.
</P>
<P>
   Near the mammoth Achinebuli winery, locals in Telavi direct
visitors to a home surrounded by hanging grapevines. It is here, at
the residence of Vajha Nikolaishivili, where one can find the
finest wine in the valley, the locals say.
</P>
<P>
   A beefy man with a bronze face and a passion for wine,
Nikolaishivili talks in a constant stream about the skills his
great-grandfather taught him. He ages his wine in vats buried in
the clay floor of a storehouse on the property. He has more
customers than wine, and reserves a special vat, what he calls
``the grandchild'' for special family occasions.
</P>
<P>
   ``With each harvest you have to produce the best wines you
can,'' said Nikolaishivili, 52, who's family has been producing
homemade wine for the past seven generations. ``Otherwise you shame
the family tradition.''

company doing custom software design for American firms.
</P>
<P>
   The school's first crop of 56 programmers will form the nucleus
of what officials hope will be a budding information technology
sector that will vault Jamaica into the new millennium, helping
broaden an economy now based on tourism, mining and agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Information technology is going to take over,'' said Omar
Murray, 23, a former hotel clerk who now spends 10-hour days
building Internet web sites and learning the latest computer
languages at CIT. ``It's the wave of the future. Jamaica might not
be as developed with computers as we'd like, but I'm sure we're
going to get there.''
</P>
<P>
   The unique group of partners that set up the school is
convinced. The worldwide demand for programmers, they say,
virtually guarantees the new graduates will find jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The need for programmers is absolutely huge,'' said Ken
Abernethy(CQ), head of computer programs at Furman University, a
Greenville, S.C. school that is providing the curriculum for the
Jamaican operation. ``There are more than 250,000 jobs vacant right
now in the U.S. and the growth rate is on the order of 100,000 new
jobs per year. In the U.S., we're only graduating 25,000 bachelor's
level computer science students a year. Companies are pretty
desperate for programmers.''
</P>
<P>
   Going offshore to find those programmers is not a new idea. For
years, U.S. and European companies have been farming out software
work to programmers in Ireland, Israel, India and many Eastern
European countries. In most cases, they can get the work done
cheaper, but that's just an added bonus.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cost advantage is a factor, but in reality just getting
the resource at all is often the biggest factor,'' said Stacy
Kenworthy, president of REALM Information Technologies, an Atlanta
software company that has already contracted to hire some of the
CIT graduates. ``The competition for talent is extreme, and in some
areas the shortfall in programmers is a crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta entrepreneur James Ram identified the crisis as an
opportunity. Four years ago he founded INDUSA, a firm that
channeled software work for U.S. companies to programmers back home
in his native India.
</P>
<P>
   The idea has worked fairly well, ``although some of the clients
have been uneasy sending work 10,000 miles away,'' Ram said. ``If
they had a problem that required an in-person visit, they'd be
looking at a 23-hour flight.''
</P>
<P>
   Ram began scouting for someplace closer to the United States,
and settled on Jamaica for several reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a good basic education system based on the British
model, they speak English, they have a surprisingly good
telecommunications infrastructure and they are in the same time
zone as the Eastern U.S.,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It took Ram less than a year to get CIT up and running.
Partnering with INDUSA in the venture are Furman, a British
consortium of schools and government agencies, the Jamaican
government and the University of the West Indies in Jamaica.
</P>
<P>
   Jamaica's Minister of Commerce and Technology Phillip Paulwell,
has been a big backer, hoping that high-tech can stop the
brain-drain that Jamaica _ and other Caribbean islands _ have
experienced as their highly-educated residents have moved
elsewhere. Software programming seems a good fit because the skill
is in high demand and the industry doesn't require expensive
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Information technology will be the backbone of the global
economy of the future,'' Paulwell said when CIT was founded. ``This
new center will provide access to this economy for large numbers of
Jamaicans and help establish the human resource to launch a
vigorous software development industry in Jamaica.''
</P>
<P>
   If the school is a success _ and there are already 105 new
students enrolled for next year's term _ it could prove a big boost
to this island of 2.6 million residents, where per capita income is
about US$6,000. Jamaica's economic mainstays, like tourism, have
all been battered in the past decade by hurricanes, poor prices,
competition and other factors.
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment runs at 20 percent, with the figure rising to 45
percent for those younger than 35 years of age.
</P>
<P>
   In such a climate, CIT is a small _ but significant _ bright
spot.
</P>
<P>
   Ram is guaranteeing that INDUSA will hire CIT's successful
graduates. He will pay them a beginning wage of US$7 to US$10 an
hour to work in Jamaica for American companies, with the promise
that salaries could rise with hard work and a few years experience.
</P>
<P>
   The Jamaican government has put its money up to make the
operation a success, paying $4,000 of the $6,000 total tuition per
student, while loaning many of the students the remainder if
necessary. The students must sign a pledge to remain in Jamaica for
at least three years after they graduate.
</P>
<P>
   That requirement is based on the fact that demand for
programmers is so high in the United States that beginning college
graduates can sometimes fetch up to US$50,000 per year.
</P>
<P>
   But many of CIT's students say they want to stay in Jamaica, a
proud island nation with a rich cultural heritage. While most had
never done more than type simple forms on computers before they
enrolled, many believe their soon-to-be-earned diplomas will be
tickets to a promising future.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of us have sacrificed to be here,'' said Traceyann
Samuels, 27, who gave up a government job to enroll at CIT. ``But
it has to pay off. In four to five years, I see myself having my
own consulting business, doing work in software, imaging and
communications.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Sherwin Williams, 32, already has his own business _ a food
supplement venture that he and his wife are still running while he
attends CIT. He has designed a Web page for the business, and hopes
to design pages for others when he graduates.
</P>
<P>
   ``There aren't many people here who do this now, and I think the
field is going to mushroom,'' he said. ``I had no university
training, but now I hope to set up my own Web design shop.''
</P>
<P>
   Instructors say CIT's curriculum is demanding: students attend
classes for 8 hours a day, often following that up with several
hours of lab work. They are learning all the latest computer tools,
including Web page design, C++, Visual Basic, Java and database
technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our students will have more hands-on computer experience in
their 10 months here than most university graduates will get in a
four-year degree program,'' said Michael Glova, CIT's managing
director. ``The universities promise a diploma, but we promise
skills that are in demand.''
</P>
<P>
   The students are convinced.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw a newspaper ad for this course and it seemed like the
answer to my prayers,'' said Salomie Lyles, 23, who worked in the
hospitality industry before enrolling. ``To get a degree in
computers would've taken three years, but here we are doing it in
10 months.''

 &HT;    RADICAL STEPS MAY BE NEEDED TO SAVE CHINA'S STILL ENDANGERED
PANDAS
 &HT;    With Photos.
 &HT;    For Use Sat., Oct. 16 And Thereafter.

<P>
   WOLONG, China _ Normally, cabbages don't threaten giant pandas.
</P>
<P>
   But here the big green plants shoulder up to the very edge of a
winding, rock-pocked road, then creep in neat rows high up the most
impossible-looking mountain terrain.
</P>
<P>
   The cabbage is only one calling card of humanity inexorably
pushing itself into misty wilderness heights, fragmenting the
bamboo-forested mountainland that supports the last clusters of the
estimated 1,000 giant pandas still living in the wilds of southwest
China.
</P>
<P>
   Despite recent habitat protections, wildlife experts assess
continuing human pressures as intense. They are not at all
convinced that the enchanting animals will survive to amble through
many new chapters in their three million-year history.
</P>
<P>
   ``To save the panda species, we have a long way to go,'' Liu
Yongfan, vice-director of the State Forestry Administration, told
Chinese and American scientists gathered at this nature reserve for
a conference on pandas earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   China at least is inching down the route of protection.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Some efforts are being made to stop the human encroachment
that has cut up panda territory and divided the panda population,
making genetic in-breeding a potentially deadly problem and leaving
isolated, small groups susceptible to environmental crises that
larger numbers could weather.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Research is continuing to improve the achievements already
made in captive panda breeding, to assure the pandas survive
somewhere. China now has about 100 pandas living in captivity, most
of them bred at Chinese zoos and research institutes and the rest
captured from the wild.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  And now the Chinese are laying the groundwork for the
precarious possibility of reintroducing to the wild, pandas born in
captivity.
</P>
<P>
   But money, knowledge and national will are in short supply.
</P>
<P>
   That is partly because people don't know about the cabbages
snaking up nature reserve mountains, or the peasants still
stripping forests here for firewood, or about the poachers or the
hunters whose snares may grab pandas by mistake, but kill them
nonetheless, said Zhang Hemin, director of the China Research and
Conservation Center for the Giant Panda.
</P>
<P>
   ``In China, there is something wrong with the propaganda,''
Zhang lamented in an interview with Cox Newspapers. ``People read
about cloning, and they think there is no problem now with the
panda. Some say in the wild there are no problems.''
</P>
<P>
   His success is one reason for the blase attitude. Every time a
panda gives birth at Zhang's breeding center, the feel-good news is
trumpeted around the country by the official media.
</P>
<P>
   And before the panda conference here was half finished, Beijing
newspapers published optimistic accounts of the still tentative
hope Zhang had expressed in a speech to introduce captive-born
pandas to the wild.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of reintroduction may be an exciting, very
long-term project, but is fraught with difficulty under even the
best conditions. The newspapers did not mention that Zhang failed
to get state funding for the one-square-mile enclosure he wants to
build high on the mountain to begin experimental training, but will
be lucky to finance a semi-wild area of one-fifth of a square mile.
</P>
<P>
   If any pandas do become ready for release to the wild, a crucial
question is whether there is enough wild to support them.
</P>
<P>
   One key development that will help determine panda policy is a
panda survey that has been delayed several years for lack of funds,
according to Yan Xun, chief biologist for China's nature reserves.
</P>
<P>
   The survey is to begin early next year with the aim of
generating solid estimates of the numbers of pandas alive today and
where they live. The last survey was finished in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the population is decreasing very fast, maybe we will
formulate some strict policies to stop the spread of townships or
even to remove some co-inhabited areas,'' Yan said, referring to
areas where both pandas and humans live.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Wolong, a 720-square-mile nature reserve, attempts to
remove some peasant families who farm, hunt and collect wood simply
were called off. The issue was sensitive because many local
residents are ethnic Zang (of Tibetan origin) or Qiang, and the
central government has been under international fire elsewhere for
ham-fisted tactics against minorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a question of the rights of animals versus the rights
of people,'' explained Deng Xiangsui, director of wildlife
conservation here in Sichuan Province, where 80 percent of the
giant pandas are believed to live.
</P>
<P>
   One crucial policy change already, he said, was the outlawing of
timber-cutting throughout the region last fall. Although Deng said
the tough regulation long had been in the works, the central
government acted only after last year's devastating summer floods
cost millions of dollars
</P>
<P>
   and hundreds of lives _ another by-product of deforestation.
</P>
<P>
   This summer the government went further and prohibited the
transport of lumber in protected areas, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another goal frequently cited at the conference, which was run
by the Minnesota-based Conservation Breeding Specialist Group, is
setting up ``panda corridors'' to link reserves and other panda
habitat now divided by roads or communities or forest
clear-cutting.
</P>
<P>
   Corridors would promote mixing of animals from different
geographic areas, potentially improving genetic diversity and
giving pandas wider areas to forage for food in the event of a
localized crisis such as fire or bamboo ``flowering.''
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1970s, a cyclical outburst of bamboo blooms killed
off large patches of bamboo, resulting in starvation deaths of 80
percent of the pandas in some isolated areas.
</P>
<P>
   Making such corridors is another tough goal, an example of
``nascent ecology'' that scientists don't quite know how to do yet,
according to Ulysses Seal, chairman of the American group.
</P>
<P>
   But something must be done to ease human pressure and better
protect the remnants of the panda population, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without intervention,'' Seal said, ``I'd say in the next 100
years we'd see these fragmented (panda) populations wink out one by
one.''

FUTURE PROMISE

<P>
   TELAVI, Republic of Georgia _ Wood shavings cover the concrete
floor of the tiny workshop. The only sounds are the clang and
scrape of tools on timber as Rubiko Batiashivili goes about his
solitary work.
</P>
<P>
   With graying hair and a weathered face, Batiashivili is
virtually the last man in this sunny mountain valley who knows how
to handcraft an oaken barrel, and he is suddenly in demand. Given
the importance of wine to the economy of this former Soviet
republic, Georgia's future well-being may rest in Batiashivili's
rough hands.
</P>
<P>
   The managers of the sprawling Soviet-era Achinebuli wine factory
here in the Telavi believe they have found the innovation that will
make their product competitive in the world. The breakthrough is
wood _ not-so-high-tech wooden barrels for storing wine and
mellowing its flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Quality grapes grow in abundance is this green valley, a
winemaking region called Kakheti, in the shadow of the Caucasus
Mountains. Georgia was the Napa Valley of the tsars. Georgian wines
were prized for their flavor and clarity.
</P>
<P>
   And then came the Soviet industrial revolution. The Soviet's
built mass-production plants in the 1950s and 1960s with gigantic
steel vats that reduced prized Georgian wines to the ordinary,
though they remain popular in Russia and Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Now, hoping to revive their winemaking skills and appeal to
lucrative Western markets, Georgian vintners are tapping into past
traditions with plans to store their wine in wooden barrels and
improve its flavor and reputation worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   The Achinebuli winery, one of the country's largest, hired
Batiashivili last year after locals identified the 63-year-old
woodworker as one of the last of a dying breed. He learned the
craft of making barrels to store wine as a teenager half a century
ago, and now he is again putting the skill to work.
</P>
<P>
   He spends his days in his workshop at a corner of the winery
hewing and assembling small barrels. One day soon, he will begin
making full-sized barrels to store wine. For now, they are content
to let him practice his craft, and teach it to others.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I started, all the wineries used wooden barrels,'' said
Batiashivili. He added with a smile: ``This factory makes very good
wine, but of course my homemade wine is better.''
</P>
<P>
   Batiashivili's boastfulness is something of a national trait in
Georgia, where virtually every rural household produces its own
wine, as it has for generations.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Georgia's top wine producers want to live up to their
country's winemaking heritage.
</P>
<P>
   With the collapse of communism in 1991 and the global success of
such small wine-producing countries as Chile and Australia, the
Georgia wine industry believes it could find its niche in the world
market.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have great traditions. We used to produce very good wines.
But in the Soviet period, we were very backwards and our problem is
that our viniculture specialists don't know just how backward we
are,'' said David Dolmazashivili, director of the Achinebuli
winery.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly, the quality is improving as the winery has sent its
winemakers abroad to see how Californians, Italians and the French
harvest and produce wines.
</P>
<P>
   Over the summer, Dolmazashivili toured the California wine
regions and returned to spread the word on how far Georgia must go
to compete with the likes of Robert Mondavi wineries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now at least we know what we want and need. We cannot afford
it, but at least we know, whereas before we thought we had the
best,'' Dolmazashivili said.
</P>
<P>
   Next year, the winery will import oak barrels from California to
begin storing what will become vintage, upscale wine. In the next
batch, they hope to use homemade barrels produced by Batiashivili.
</P>
<P>
   The winery already has begun to purchase stainless steel
processing equipment from Italy to replace the worn and corroding
Soviet-era equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The parent company, Georgia Wine and Spirits, was founded in
1993 as the state-owned vineyards were being privatized, and is
responsible for about half the country's production and sales. The
French beverage multinational Pernod Richard owns a share of the
Georgia company.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the former Soviet Union, the quest to compete
globally begins with the expensive task of updating the technology.
Decades of central planning and lack of competition have left
rusting factories unable to function profitably in a market
economy.
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia, though, winemakers have the grapes and the
reputation that has seen them through the rough decade. Wine
remains one of the small country's top exports, sold mainly to
Russia and other former Soviet states.
</P>
<P>
   Yet at its peak in Soviet times, Georgia exported about 120
million bottles of wine a year. Last year, the total was only about
10 million.
</P>
<P>
   Georgian wines sell sporadically in the United States, several
thousand bottles a year primarily in New York, Los Angeles and
Chicago, where Russian immigrants maintain a miniscule but steady
demand for them.
</P>
<P>
   Earning a reputation in the West will not be easy in a crowded
market of fine wines from Europe, California, South America and
Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem facing producers in Georgia is the lack of
quality control. With some 500 varieties of grapes growing in the
country, Georgia needs establish an appellation system, similar to
France's regional controls that define in absolute terms what makes
a Burgundy, Bordeaux or Beaujolais.
</P>
<P>
   Producers agree that even Georgia's best-known varieties _ a dry
white wine called Tsinandali, similar to a Chablis, and a dry red
called Saperavi-Mukuzanik, akin to a Merlot _ suffer from widely
varying tastes depending on the winery. Georgia also grapples with
a problem of counterfeiting, claiming that illicit producers in
Russia, Ukraine, Romania and Slovakia bottle wines using Georgia
labels to exploit the good reputation.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, winemakers said, the small and poor nation needs
economic freedoms that will encourage entrepreneurs to make and
market their own vintages.
</P>
<P>
   They already exist in abundance here. Virtually every Georgian
household traditionally has a cellar of homemade wine. But few can
find the capital to develop into full-fledged wineries to bottle
and market their product.
</P>
<P>
   Near the mammoth Achinebuli winery, locals in Telavi direct
visitors to a home surrounded by hanging grapevines. It is here, at
the residence of Vajha Nikolaishivili, where one can find the
finest wine in the valley, the locals say.
</P>
<P>
   A beefy man with a bronze face and a passion for wine,
Nikolaishivili talks in a constant stream about the skills his
great-grandfather taught him. He ages his wine in vats buried in
the clay floor of a storehouse on the property. He has more
customers than wine, and reserves a special vat, what he calls
``the grandchild'' for special family occasions.
</P>
<P>
   ``With each harvest you have to produce the best wines you
can,'' said Nikolaishivili, 52, who's family has been producing
homemade wine for the past seven generations. ``Otherwise you shame
the family tradition.''

   MONTEGO BAY, Jamaica _ Luxury resorts line the white sand
beaches, calypso and reggae pulse from open-air bars and sunburned
tourists do the limbo, rum drinks with little umbrellas in hand.
But while the visitors are busy enjoying what Jamaica is best known
for _ sun, sand and fun _ a group of earnest students in this lush
resort are building what many hope will be a new future for this
economically troubled island.
</P>
<P>
   In early December, the newly-formed Caribbean Institute of
Technology, or CIT will graduate its first class of computer
programmers, most of whom will go to work for an Atlanta-based
company doing custom software design for American firms.
</P>
<P>
   The school's first crop of 56 programmers will form the nucleus
of what officials hope will be a budding information technology
sector that will vault Jamaica into the new millennium, helping
broaden an economy now based on tourism, mining and agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Information technology is going to take over,'' said Omar
Murray, 23, a former hotel clerk who now spends 10-hour days
building Internet web sites and learning the latest computer
languages at CIT. ``It's the wave of the future. Jamaica might not
be as developed with computers as we'd like, but I'm sure we're
going to get there.''
</P>
<P>
   The unique group of partners that set up the school is
convinced. The worldwide demand for programmers, they say,
virtually guarantees the new graduates will find jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The need for programmers is absolutely huge,'' said Ken
Abernethy(CQ), head of computer programs at Furman University, a
Greenville, S.C. school that is providing the curriculum for the
Jamaican operation. ``There are more than 250,000 jobs vacant right
now in the U.S. and the growth rate is on the order of 100,000 new
jobs per year. In the U.S., we're only graduating 25,000 bachelor's
level computer science students a year. Companies are pretty
desperate for programmers.''
</P>
<P>
   Going offshore to find those programmers is not a new idea. For
years, U.S. and European companies have been farming out software
work to programmers in Ireland, Israel, India and many Eastern
European countries. In most cases, they can get the work done
cheaper, but that's just an added bonus.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cost advantage is a factor, but in reality just getting
the resource at all is often the biggest factor,'' said Stacy
Kenworthy, president of REALM Information Technologies, an Atlanta
software company that has already contracted to hire some of the
CIT graduates. ``The competition for talent is extreme, and in some
areas the shortfall in programmers is a crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta entrepreneur James Ram identified the crisis as an
opportunity. Four years ago he founded INDUSA, a firm that
channeled software work for U.S. companies to programmers back home
in his native India.
</P>
<P>
   The idea has worked fairly well, ``although some of the clients
have been uneasy sending work 10,000 miles away,'' Ram said. ``If
they had a problem that required an in-person visit, they'd be
looking at a 23-hour flight.''
</P>
<P>
   Ram began scouting for someplace closer to the United States,
and settled on Jamaica for several reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a good basic education system based on the British
model, they speak English, they have a surprisingly good
telecommunications infrastructure and they are in the same time
zone as the Eastern U.S.,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It took Ram less than a year to get CIT up and running.
Partnering with INDUSA in the venture are Furman, a British
consortium of schools and government agencies, the Jamaican
government and the University of the West Indies in Jamaica.
</P>
<P>
   Jamaica's Minister of Commerce and Technology Phillip Paulwell,
has been a big backer, hoping that high-tech can stop the
brain-drain that Jamaica _ and other Caribbean islands _ have
experienced as their highly-educated residents have moved
elsewhere. Software programming seems a good fit because the skill
is in high demand and the industry doesn't require expensive
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Information technology will be the backbone of the global
economy of the future,'' Paulwell said when CIT was founded. ``This
new center will provide access to this economy for large numbers of
Jamaicans and help establish the human resource to launch a
vigorous software development industry in Jamaica.''
</P>
<P>
   If the school is a success _ and there are already 105 new
students enrolled for next year's term _ it could prove a big boost
to this island of 2.6 million residents, where per capita income is
about US$6,000. Jamaica's economic mainstays, like tourism, have
all been battered in the past decade by hurricanes, poor prices,
competition and other factors.
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment runs at 20 percent, with the figure rising to 45
percent for those younger than 35 years of age.
</P>
<P>
   In such a climate, CIT is a small _ but significant _ bright
spot.
</P>
<P>
   Ram is guaranteeing that INDUSA will hire CIT's successful
graduates. He will pay them a beginning wage of US$7 to US$10 an
hour to work in Jamaica for American companies, with the promise
that salaries could rise with hard work and a few years experience.
</P>
<P>
   The Jamaican government has put its money up to make the
operation a success, paying $4,000 of the $6,000 total tuition per
student, while loaning many of the students the remainder if
necessary. The students must sign a pledge to remain in Jamaica for
at least three years after they graduate.
</P>
<P>
   That requirement is based on the fact that demand for
programmers is so high in the United States that beginning college
graduates can sometimes fetch up to US$50,000 per year.
</P>
<P>
   But many of CIT's students say they want to stay in Jamaica, a
proud island nation with a rich cultural heritage. While most had
never done more than type simple forms on computers before they
enrolled, many believe their soon-to-be-earned diplomas will be
tickets to a promising future.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of us have sacrificed to be here,'' said Traceyann
Samuels, 27, who gave up a government job to enroll at CIT. ``But
it has to pay off. In four to five years, I see myself having my
own consulting business, doing work in software, imaging and
communications.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Sherwin Williams, 32, already has his own business _ a food
supplement venture that he and his wife are still running while he
attends CIT. He has designed a Web page for the business, and hopes
to design pages for others when he graduates.
</P>
<P>
   ``There aren't many people here who do this now, and I think the
field is going to mushroom,'' he said. ``I had no university
training, but now I hope to set up my own Web design shop.''
</P>
<P>
   Instructors say CIT's curriculum is demanding: students attend
classes for 8 hours a day, often following that up with several
hours of lab work. They are learning all the latest computer tools,
including Web page design, C++, Visual Basic, Java and database
technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our students will have more hands-on computer experience in
their 10 months here than most university graduates will get in a
four-year degree program,'' said Michael Glova, CIT's managing
director. ``The universities promise a diploma, but we promise
skills that are in demand.''
</P>
<P>
   The students are convinced.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw a newspaper ad for this course and it seemed like the
answer to my prayers,'' said Salomie Lyles, 23, who worked in the
hospitality industry before enrolling. ``To get a degree in
computers would've taken three years, but here we are doing it in
10 months.''

PANDAS

   WOLONG, China _ Normally, cabbages don't threaten giant pandas.
</P>
<P>
   But here the big green plants shoulder up to the very edge of a
winding, rock-pocked road, then creep in neat rows high up the most
impossible-looking mountain terrain.
</P>
<P>
   The cabbage is only one calling card of humanity inexorably
pushing itself into misty wilderness heights, fragmenting the
bamboo-forested mountainland that supports the last clusters of the
estimated 1,000 giant pandas still living in the wilds of southwest
China.
</P>
<P>
   Despite recent habitat protections, wildlife experts assess
continuing human pressures as intense. They are not at all
convinced that the enchanting animals will survive to amble through
many new chapters in their three million-year history.
</P>
<P>
   ``To save the panda species, we have a long way to go,'' Liu
Yongfan, vice-director of the State Forestry Administration, told
Chinese and American scientists gathered at this nature reserve for
a conference on pandas earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   China at least is inching down the route of protection.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Some efforts are being made to stop the human encroachment
that has cut up panda territory and divided the panda population,
making genetic in-breeding a potentially deadly problem and leaving
isolated, small groups susceptible to environmental crises that
larger numbers could weather.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Research is continuing to improve the achievements already
made in captive panda breeding, to assure the pandas survive
somewhere. China now has about 100 pandas living in captivity, most
of them bred at Chinese zoos and research institutes and the rest
captured from the wild.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  And now the Chinese are laying the groundwork for the
precarious possibility of reintroducing to the wild, pandas born in
captivity.
</P>
<P>
   But money, knowledge and national will are in short supply.
</P>
<P>
   That is partly because people don't know about the cabbages
snaking up nature reserve mountains, or the peasants still
stripping forests here for firewood, or about the poachers or the
hunters whose snares may grab pandas by mistake, but kill them
nonetheless, said Zhang Hemin, director of the China Research and
Conservation Center for the Giant Panda.
</P>
<P>
   ``In China, there is something wrong with the propaganda,''
Zhang lamented in an interview with Cox Newspapers. ``People read
about cloning, and they think there is no problem now with the
panda. Some say in the wild there are no problems.''
</P>
<P>
   His success is one reason for the blase attitude. Every time a
panda gives birth at Zhang's breeding center, the feel-good news is
trumpeted around the country by the official media.
</P>
<P>
   And before the panda conference here was half finished, Beijing
newspapers published optimistic accounts of the still tentative
hope Zhang had expressed in a speech to introduce captive-born
pandas to the wild.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of reintroduction may be an exciting, very
long-term project, but is fraught with difficulty under even the
best conditions. The newspapers did not mention that Zhang failed
to get state funding for the one-square-mile enclosure he wants to
build high on the mountain to begin experimental training, but will
be lucky to finance a semi-wild area of one-fifth of a square mile.
</P>
<P>
   If any pandas do become ready for release to the wild, a crucial
question is whether there is enough wild to support them.
</P>
<P>
   One key development that will help determine panda policy is a
panda survey that has been delayed several years for lack of funds,
according to Yan Xun, chief biologist for China's nature reserves.
</P>
<P>
   The survey is to begin early next year with the aim of
generating solid estimates of the numbers of pandas alive today and
where they live. The last survey was finished in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the population is decreasing very fast, maybe we will
formulate some strict policies to stop the spread of townships or
even to remove some co-inhabited areas,'' Yan said, referring to
areas where both pandas and humans live.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Wolong, a 720-square-mile nature reserve, attempts to
remove some peasant families who farm, hunt and collect wood simply
were called off. The issue was sensitive because many local
residents are ethnic Zang (of Tibetan origin) or Qiang, and the
central government has been under international fire elsewhere for
ham-fisted tactics against minorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a question of the rights of animals versus the rights
of people,'' explained Deng Xiangsui, director of wildlife
conservation here in Sichuan Province, where 80 percent of the
giant pandas are believed to live.
</P>
<P>
   One crucial policy change already, he said, was the outlawing of
timber-cutting throughout the region last fall. Although Deng said
the tough regulation long had been in the works, the central
government acted only after last year's devastating summer floods
cost millions of dollars
</P>
<P>
   and hundreds of lives _ another by-product of deforestation.
</P>
<P>
   This summer the government went further and prohibited the
transport of lumber in protected areas, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another goal frequently cited at the conference, which was run
by the Minnesota-based Conservation Breeding Specialist Group, is
setting up ``panda corridors'' to link reserves and other panda
habitat now divided by roads or communities or forest
clear-cutting.
</P>
<P>
   Corridors would promote mixing of animals from different
geographic areas, potentially improving genetic diversity and
giving pandas wider areas to forage for food in the event of a
localized crisis such as fire or bamboo ``flowering.''
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1970s, a cyclical outburst of bamboo blooms killed
off large patches of bamboo, resulting in starvation deaths of 80
percent of the pandas in some isolated areas.
</P>
<P>
   Making such corridors is another tough goal, an example of
``nascent ecology'' that scientists don't quite know how to do yet,
according to Ulysses Seal, chairman of the American group.
</P>
<P>
   But something must be done to ease human pressure and better
protect the remnants of the panda population, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without intervention,'' Seal said, ``I'd say in the next 100
years we'd see these fragmented (panda) populations wink out one by
one.''

   1. THE BIZARRE WORLD OF MATTHEW BARNEY When Matthew Barney came
onto the world art scene in 1991 with his surreal sculptures and
videos, he was instantly successful. Since then, his work has only
got better and stranger. He has mostly been making a series of
increasingly elaborate films, called ``Cremaster.'' Now 32, Barney
is the most important American artist of his generation. By Michael
Kimmelman. From The New York Times Magazine. Full-length (5,100
words) + edited article available.
_____________________________________________________________ 2.
NEW JAMES BOND FILM -- ``THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH'' + PHOTOS Iain
Johnstone was the only journalist invited to be on the set and
locations for the duration of the shooting of the latest James Bond
film ``The World Is Not Enough.'' Here are 3 intriguing articles
with the inside story. (Not available in the U.K.)
</P>
<P>
   (a) PIERCE BROSNAN Profile of Pierce Brosnan, who plays secret
agent 007 in the new (19th) James Bond film ``The World Is Not
Enough.'' Iain Johnstone talked to Brosnan and watched him at work
for six months. He explains why this actor has become the most
successful of the five men to play Bond. 2,000 words.
</P>
<P>
   (b) THE BOND GIRLS Bond Girls have been an integral part of the
series since Ursula Andress strolled out of the sea in her white
bikini in 1962. Beauty is adroitly combined with brains in the new
Bond film which features six actresses : Sophie Marceau, Judi
Dench, Denise Richards, Samantha Bond, Serena Scott Thomas and
Maria Grazia Cucinotta. Their nationalities range from English to
French to Italian to American and their ages from 27 to 64. 2,000
words.
</P>
<P>
   (c) Q'S FIRST FAREWELL PERFORMANCE The latest James Bond film
could well be the last one to feature Desmond Llewelyn as 'Q,'' the
``gadget wizard.'' He is the longest serving Bond actor, in 17 out
of the 19 films in the series and first appeared in 'From Russia
With Love,' 36 years ago. Now 85, Llewelyn is a little over the age
for service in MI6, but popular demand has kept him in the job.
John Cleese was recruited to play his assistant in the new film.
2,000 words.
_____________________________________________________________

<P>
   3. PIANO MANIAC ``I am an excellent pianist,'' writes Irving
Wardle. ``The only snag is that I don't play very well. The answer
is to practice every day .... once I've salvaged the wreck of my
adolescent technique, I may yet find employment at a white baby
grand in a piano bar.'' Being a 65-year-old piano student made him
feel like a freak, but he signed up anyway for a piano summer
school in France. From Prospect Magazine. 1,500 words. (N/A U.K.)
Irving Wardle is a former theatre critic.
_____________________________________________________________ 4.
NORTHAM EXPOSURE He's handsome, he's gifted, he's smart, he's on
the verge of becoming a movie star, but British actor Jeremy
Northam wants people to see him as a contemporary guy. Best known
for his portrayals of repressed Englishmen in period films such as
``Emma'' and ``An Ideal Husband,'' he trades in his old-fashioned
costumes for prison stripes in the new comedy ``Happy, Texas.'' By
Merle Ginsberg. From W magazine. 1,000 words.
_____________________________________________________________ 5.
BRUCE WILLIS : BEST AND WORST OF TIMES These are bittersweet times
for Bruce Willis, one of the most prolific of Hollywood's $20
millon men. While his professional life has rarely been better, he
is currently caught up in personal trauma and is separated from his
wife, Demi Moore. While they have not officially divorced, one of
Hollywood's highest-profile marriages appears to be over. Willis
says his character in his new film ``Story of Us'' - a laid-back,
impractical writer - is a lot closer to the real Bruce Willis than
his action-movie persona. By Ivor Davis. 1,500 words + photos. (N/A
Great Britain and Australia.)
_____________________________________________________________ 6. A
REGULAR BROAD WITH A REGULAR FACE Several characters created on the
famous U.S. television show ``Saturday Night Live'' have made their
way to movie screens. The latest SNL creation to hit the big screen
is a neurotic Catholic schoolgirl called Mary Katherine Gallagher,
the alter ego of comedienne Molly Shannon. ``Superstar'' is the
story of a high school misfit. It is definitely a comedy, but it's
also a surprisingly sensitive and thoughtful treatment of teenage
alienation. By Joshua Mooney. 1,000 words + photo. BPI.

   His company, based in Woburn, Mass., has emerged as a major
force in the booming Internet auction business and a serious
challenger to the dominance of auction leader eBay Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Yet you'll never purchase a set of golf clubs or Beanie Babies
from FairMarket, at least not directly. Rather than compete
directly with eBay, FairMarket works behind the scenes. The company
has won contracts to host its auctions on dozens of popular Web
sites. If you bid on merchandise on the Microsoft Network's auction
service, or offer something for sale at the Lycos or Excite search
portals, you're really using FairMarket's auction service.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think of it as a private-label eBay,'' Randall says.
</P>
<P>
   For now, FairMarket carries only around 100,000 items, far fewer
than the 3 million or so listed at eBay. But Randall is aiming for
rapid growth by weaving all of the auctions hosted by FairMarket
into a single network of wheeling and dealing.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Boston.com is one of the FairMarket sites. If a
reader decides to auction off a set of golf clubs using the
Boston.com auction service, his item will also be available to
potential buyers on every other site that has a FairMarket auction.
So if a Microsoft Network user wants to bid on golf clubs, he'll
see the clubs listed at the Boston.com auction. In effect, it'll be
one big auction, spread across about 100 Web sites, which between
them attract 46 million visitors a month. That's almost six times
more monthly visitors than eBay attracts. (Boston.com and The
Boston Globe are both owned by The New York Times Co.)
</P>
<P>
   EBay spokesman Kevin Pursglove shrugs off the FairMarket
challenge. ``eBay users are pretty smart people,'' he said. ``We
know that they're going to keep their eyes and their ears open and
they're going to go where they can get the very best value.''
Pursglove predicts eBay's loyal users will keep the company out in
front.
</P>
<P>
   Sue Rothberg, who studies Internet auctions for Gomez Advisors
Inc. in Lincoln, thinks Pursglove's confidence is justified. ``EBay
is still the biggest and the best, period,'' she says. But she
warns that the FairMarket network could take business from other
independent auction sites.
</P>
<P>
   Randall holds an even sterner view. ``Our take on the
industry,'' he says, ``is that stand-alone sites that are
non-networked are doomed.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet that was exactly the business Randall had in mind when he
founded FairMarket in 1997 _ a stand-alone Internet auction site,
specializing in computer products.
</P>
<P>
   It was the latest career change for a self-described action
junkie. The Harvard alumnus and Harvard Business School graduate
made his mark as a brand manager for Procter &AMP; Gamble, the same
training ground that produced America Online Inc. chief executive
Steve Case.
</P>
<P>
   But somehow, peddling Dreft and Oxydol detergents began to lose
its appeal. ``Detergents are fine, but they're pretty boring,''
said Randall. ``I love a million things going on at once, nonstop
challenges . . . that's not what you get at Procter &AMP; Gamble.''
</P>
<P>
   Randall knew it was time to bail in 1994, when he got a look at
Mosaic, the first popular Internet browser. ``That's where it's
at,'' he told himself. Randall foresaw that the industries that
would grow up around the Internet would need the kind of marketing
skill he'd learned at P&AMP;G.
</P>
<P>
   His first move was to NECX Direct, of Peabody, Mass. In those
days, NECX was mainly a computer parts broker, operating an
electronic exchange on which manufacturers could bid on bulk orders
of chips and hard drives.
</P>
<P>
   But NECX founder Henry Bertolon wanted to branch out. In 1993,
he'd begun an Internet-based service for selling computer parts and
supplies. Randall believed it could be the foundation of a major
electronic retail business.
</P>
<P>
   In less than two years, Randall built the NECX on-line store
into a successful on-line enterprise. ``We were the largest Web
site in the world at the time I was running it,'' he claims.
</P>
<P>
   But when he left NECX to work for Barry Diller's Internet
Shopping Network, NECX sued, citing a non-compete agreement Randall
had signed. ``They'd sued about 30 people before, and they never
won a lawsuit,'' said Randall. ``They won this one.''
</P>
<P>
   Randall worked on Yahoo Inc.'s e-commerce business unit for a
few months, but by late 1996 he wanted to leave Silicon Valley and
return to the Bay State. The next year, he founded FairMarket in
his Beacon Hill apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, the company was just another auction site, selling
computer parts, but Randall soon had a change of heart. ``I came to
the conclusion that auctions were going to be on everybody's site,
and consumers were going to go where they were already going.''
</P>
<P>
   So instead of trying to persuade Internet users to visit his
auction site, Randall decided to carry his auctions to where the
users were, striking deals with well-established sites to run
auctions for them. FairMarket gets a fee for running the auction on
its own server computers and a 1 percent cut of the selling price
of auctioned items. The Web sites that offer the auctions get a
popular new feature that can attract more traffic to their sites
and increase the prices the sites can charge to advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   It sounds like a good deal to FairMarket partners including
Charles Conn, chief executive of Ticketmaster Online-CitySearch
Inc. His company already has CityAuction, a service that runs
regional auctions targeted at communities throughout the country.
But Conn thinks FairMarket will help him maximize the number of
items for sale and the number of shoppers who might buy. ``People
want to go to the place where the most goods are, and posters want
to post where the most people are,'' Conn says.
</P>
<P>
   Gomez Advisors' Rothberg doubts that people who go to
Ticketmaster Online for concert tickets will stick around for
auctions. But if even a small percentage of visitors to FairMarket
sites participate in the auctions, that'll quickly add up to
millions of users _ enough for a very healthy business indeed.
</P>
<P>
   Randall says FairMarket itself is not for sale to some larger
entity. ``Lots of companies are interested, but it's not our
path.'' Randall's more the initial public offering type _ ``We're
going down that path right now, and talking to bankers.''
</P>
<P>
   With FairMarket's potential as a leader in e-commerce, the day
its stock goes public could be the biggest auction of them all.

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   &HT;    Electronic Campus a joint effort of colleges in 16 states
 &HT;    By Ernest Holsendolph
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Brandy McCorkle had a problem. She needed one more
course to graduate, but the course she needed on the Mississippi
State campus conflicted with her job. She was stymied.
</P>
<P>
   Stacia Washer, a full-time hospital worker in Quality, Ky., and
a busy mother, desperately needed to find time to study toward a
degree _ but how to fit it in an already demanding schedule?
</P>
<P>
   Both of these women found refuge in one of the newest and
fastest growing sources of higher education, the Electronic Campus.
It is a fast-growing so-called distance learning program, where
students in 16 states take college courses by way of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The Electronic Campus, not to be confused with the new Georgia
GLOBE program, started just two years ago with 104 courses and has
now mushroomed into one of the biggest ``campuses'' in the
Southeast.
</P>
<P>
   At last count, the Electronic Campus comprised more than 2,000
courses, with more than 20,000 students enrolled, many of them in
their choice of 65 degree programs. All level of degrees are
offered, and the Electronic Campus is now connected to the Georgia
Galileo library system, providing vast new sources of reference
readings to the students on the far-flung campus.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best thing about this program is that we are not a flea
market, we are a mall, an educational mall,'' said Mark Musick,
president of the Southern Regional Education Board, which started
and now governs the Electronic Campus.
</P>
<P>
   Since it was envisioned in 1996, the Web-based campus has been
governed by the participating colleges that offer courses. It is
coordinated by the SREB.
</P>
<P>
   The colleges maintain records of enrolled students, keep track
of their progress and decide what credits are given for the work.
</P>
<P>
   The SREB acts as the switchboard for the courses, and as dean
assuring that the courses are of the right caliber. The board,
through Musick and his team, puts together support services like
the Galileo addition.
</P>
<P>
   And so McCorkle got Mississippi State credit for her course, and
Washer can work through Western Kentucky, the school she would
attend if she had the time to do so.
</P>
<P>
   As with everything on the Internet, its glory is the always the
connection, giving students and schools a new flexibility.
</P>
<P>
   Musick said Clayton College &AMP; State University and Southern
Polytechnic have been among the busiest and most creative partners
in the Electronic Campus. Clayton's former president, Richard
Skinner, was named this year to organize a new program of
electronic education to bolster Georgians' opportunity to benefit
from distance learning.
</P>
<P>
   The point of the state's program, GLOBE or Global Learning
On-line for Business and Education, is to get more Georgians to
take college courses and to strengthen the state's pool of workers
in information technology and develop other skills for business
growth.
</P>
<P>
   The Electronic Campus has no such focus but instead stretches
broadly to provide a range of courses, emphasizing regional
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   I wondered how the colleges, normally so competitive, agreed to
such a cooperative program.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governors of the 16 states decided three years ago that we
needed this 'educational free trade zone' to suit students needs
and strengthen the system for the region,'' Musick said.
</P>
<P>
   He pointed out that though schools are competitive, on the
higher levels and in research endeavors, cooperation has always
been a hallmark of secondary education. This has led to a kind of
educational ``common market'' approach to electronic or distance
learning.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is certainly a sense of cooperation as we build this
program,'' said Bruce N. Chaloux, Electronic Campus director.
</P>
<P>
   The range of offerings is large, from simple courses with
reading lists and study guides to others that are interactive Web
sites, with give and take between teachers and even among students.
</P>
<P>
   The Electronic Campus can be viewed at the following site:
www.sreb.org.
</P>
<P>
   Clayton State's Web offerings range from Accounting 101 to
periodontics and AIDS management to courses in writing and music
appreciation. To view the courses and enrollment information at
Clayton State, see the following site: distancelearning
</P>
<P>
   .clayton.edu/srec/
</P>
<P>
   Some futurists have predicted that the growth of distance
learning could spell the end of higher education as we know it, and
provide an escape from the rigidity and expense of old-fashioned
education using bricks and mortar.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Chaloux sees it another way. ``Youngsters will still go to
college,'' he said, ``but the ways they learn will change and there
will be newer options and approaches that will enhance their
learning opportunities.''

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   &HT;    Net company sued over planned sale
 &HT;    By Lori Hawkins
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ A shareholder of Net-Worker Inc., an Internet
company that alerts subscribers to career and networking events, is
suing the company's founders to prevent its sale to Agillion Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Bruneman, former executive publisher of the company's Web
site, Networker.com, is also seeking $4 million in damages,
according to the lawsuit filed in Travis County District Court.
</P>
<P>
   Named as defendants are Agillion, which provides Web-based
software services, Steve Guengerich, Net-Worker's chairman and
chief executive, and Steve Papermaster, a director in Net-Worker
and chief executive of Agillion.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit claims that if Net-Worker is folded into Agillion _
as Guengerich and Papermaster are planning _ that no cash will
change hands and that stockholders will not get any equity from the
deal. It also accuses Papermaster and Guengerich of stealing
Net-Worker trade secrets and of failing to obtain bids from other
parties.
</P>
<P>
   Papermaster and Guengerich declined to comment, citing pending
legal action.
</P>
<P>
   Papermaster and Guengerich acquired the Net-Worker software from
Civic Pride Inc. in March and created Networker.com. Net-Worker is
backed by the Powershift Group, a venture development group whose
principals are Papermaster and Guengerich.
</P>
<P>
   After the sale, Bruneman, who helped create the software at
Civic Pride, moved to Net-Worker and received 10 percent of the
company's stock, the lawsuit said.
</P>
<P>
   Agillion, whose chief executive is Papermaster, is also backed
by Powershift.

ONLINE COMPANIES TRY TO DEVELOP POLITICAL E-CLOUT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN RICHMAN and MICHAEL PAULSON   c.1999 Seattle
Post-Intelligencer   WASHINGTON _ Internet companies have taken
Wall Street by storm, and now they're trying to do the same in the
nation's capital.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some of the biggest names in Internet commerce and services _
including Seattle's Amazon.com _ have lined up behind the effort.
America Online, eBay, ExciteHome and Yahoo! are among the other
companies joining forces as NetCoalition.com.
</P>
<P>
   Their mission: influence decisions affecting companies whose
business is purely Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Uppermost on the current agenda: Keep cyberspace free of taxes
and regulation; stop legislation that could curb growth.
</P>
<P>
   Their lobbying aims to cut a distinctly different swath in
high-tech political opinion making in Washington. That's partly
because the companies don't think the efforts of big, broad-based
firms like Microsoft necessarily represent their views.
</P>
<P>
   But the companies themselves also don't fit the profile of
industrial clout in the nation's capital. Internet executives are
often twentysomethings. And the companies they run may be small,
start-up enterprises that have yet to show a dime of profit _ not a
prescription for getting attention in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The effort got off the ground in July, and in recent weeks
Amazon government affairs counsel David Gabrieli and the lobbyist
for NetCoalition.com have been meeting with members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is to become part of the process in D.C., to bring
the pure-play Internet perspective to D.C., and to act as a
resource to Congress and the executive branch,'' said Gabrieli, who
represents Amazon.com, the world's largest Internet retailer and
one of the e-commerce companies that hasn't yet turned a profit.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional staff members said the Internet industry needs to
court members of Congress from its home states, who are its natural
advocates, as well as members of key committees, such as Commerce,
that regulate issues of importance to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very positive step,'' said Tony Williams, chief of
staff for Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., who has championed Microsoft
in Congress. ``These high-tech companies don't think about
government and politics because they're busy starting their
businesses, but at some point they realize government is having an
impact, and they need to get engaged.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the top officials of Internet companies don't even know
their own members of Congress, let alone the myriad elected
officials who have a voice in enacting laws that can affect the
companies, Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   ``As you grow, you get bigger and you run into regulations and
people who don't understand your issues,'' he said. ``We want them
to keep growing, but they need to have a relationship with us so we
understand what impacts them.''
</P>
<P>
   The companies have approached Rep. Adam Smith, D-Wash., who has
been active in the debate over how to regulate the export of
encrypted software, which is technology that allows secure
transmission of e-mail and financial transactions.
</P>
<P>
   ``All industries want to get their voices heard on the (Capitol)
Hill, so this is not surprising, but we think it's great,'' said
Ali Weise, Smith's spokeswoman. ``Technology is now so pervasive in
our lives that every committee in Congress deals with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Congress is paying increasing attention to the Internet. More
than 75 pieces of legislation now pending would regulate the
Internet in some way, and there's increasing talk about taxing
electronic commerce. Before any decisions are made, the companies
want Congress to recognize their chief executives as the experts in
electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, some of the lobbying is being done by the
companies' chief executives and other top officers, who fly to
Washington periodically to visit lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're the ones on the front line in making the Internet
work,'' said Elizabeth Wang, general counsel for Internet
advertising company DoubleClick Inc. of New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our overall mission is that Congress turn to us before bills
are passed,'' added Todd Krizelman, co-chief executive of
theglobe.com, a New York company that lets Internet users set up
free Web pages.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the Internet has grown so rapidly and affected so many
different industries, the government needs to understand how these
changes are going to impact the economy and evaluate when and when
not to be involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of NetCoalition's CEOs don't fit the traditional image of a
lobbyist, or even of a chief executive officer. Theglobe's co-CEOs,
for example, are both in their mid-20s.
</P>
<P>
   Members are selling a product some members of Congress aren't
familiar with. Executives from NetCoalition said some lawmakers
have rarely been online and have only a vague understanding of what
Internet companies do or how legislation might affect them.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, lawmakers are used to being courted by large, rich
corporations, not small, high-growth _ and often money-losing _
start-ups. Stephan Paternot, the other co-chief executive of
theglobe, said the NetCoalition's influence in Washington shouldn't
be measured by traditional yardsticks like profit. In this new
industry, growth rate, brand recognition and ability to attract Web
users are what's important, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the companies that are already being responsibly run,
and we want to make sure some shop out in the middle of nowhere
doesn't come out and taint what we do,'' Paternot said.
</P>
<P>
   The companies also want to distinguish themselves from
broad-based technology giants like Microsoft Corp. and AT&AMP;T Corp.,
which, although well-known to lawmakers, may not represent the
interests of companies whose fortunes are tied solely to the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   NetCoalition says it worries that Congress' new-found interest
in cyberspace could spawn laws that will limit or slow the growth
of the Internet. Technology behemoths _ with heavy stakes in other
businesses such as software or telecommunications _ could survive
that, but companies like those in NetCoalition couldn't, said Tim
Stevens, a corporate counsel for Inktomi Corp. The success of these
companies rides on the Internet alone _ and its explosive growth.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, adjusting to the pace of Washington's bureaucracy has
been ``like putting on the parking brake after going 75 miles an
hour,'' said Brian O'Shaughnessy, a former policy director at the
Internet Alliance who is now senior manager for corporate
communications at Network Solutions Inc.
</P>
<P>
   None of the companies has spent much money on the new lobbying
venture. They committed funding for only one year, though they
expect it to last longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will commit for as long as it takes,'' said Amazon's
Gabrieli.
</P>
<P>
   NetCoalition rents office space from Wiley, Rein &AMP; Fielding, a
blue-chip lobbying firm in Washington, D.C., that will help
represent the group. The group has a single employee, Daniel Ebert,
who says he now functions as its coordinator but in the future will
also lobby.
</P>
<P>
   The nine member companies each have one vote on important issues
and will decide together whether to add other companies. No one
company is leading the group, which Gabrieli said meets about twice
a month by conference call.
</P>
<P>
   The growth of electronic commerce has spurred talk in Congress
of taxes and consumer protections _ even as both political parties
present themselves as friends of the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the Internet bills introduced so far have been referred
to committees and stayed there. Of those that have passed, most
seek to protect consumers: for example, setting a standard for
electronic signatures used to identify online credit card users and
the authors of e-mail, and establishing civil penalties for misuse
of online information such as real estate listings or stock quotes.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the companies in NetCoal-ition are less than 5 years
old. Besides DoubleClick and theglobe, the smaller Internet
companies in NetCoalition are Inktomi Corp. and Lycos Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Though getting involved in government is generally not part of a
start-up business' culture, Krizelman said the Justice Department's
lawsuit against Microsoft has been ``a great lesson'' for the
industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It taught us `better approach Washington pre-emptively, rather
than wait until there is a problem,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft nearly doubled its spending on lobbying, to $1.2
million, in the last six months of 1997 compared to the prior
half-year. That spending boost coincided with the Justice
Department's reopening its antitrust investigation, in October
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft execs, from Chairman Bill Gates on down, have
repeatedly acknowledged their naivete in the ways of Washington,
and have tried to make up for lost time with a flood of spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``In retrospect, we probably got big enough three or four years
ago to get involved in issues related to communications, (and) we
should have stepped up our activities there a bit sooner,'' Gates
said in March 1998.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ As we ease into another holiday season, the analysts
are guessing that more and more people will be doing some of their
shopping from Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   But which sites are the easiest to use? Who has the best
customer service?
</P>
<P>
   Gomez Advisors, a market research firm, looked at the best Web
sites for buying a computer. Gomez broke the results down into the
best sites for first-time buyers, bargain hunters and serious
shoppers. The results are at Gomez's Web site, www.gomez.com.
</P>
<P>
   Buy.com ranked first. Gomez said the Web site had the lowest
prices and offers 30-day toll-free customer service.

   FEMALE CEO FINDS IT'S A LONELY ROAD
</P>
<P>
   What's it like to be young, attractive, female and the head of a
Silicon Valley technology company?
</P>
<P>
   Kim Polese, chief executive of Marimba, talks about what it's
like to walk that fairly deserted street in the October issue of
Upside magazine. Upside is the print version of
www.upsidetoday.com, a Web magazine devoted to the technology
industry's personalities, companies and money.
</P>
<P>
   Polese was part of the product management group responsible for
spreading the word about Java, the programming language in which
many Internet applications are written. She left Sun Microsystems
and helped form Marimba, a company that builds and sells software
that allows software updates to be delivered to networked PCs.
After a good bit of hype, most of which focused on the novel idea
of a young, female CEO, the company went public in April _ but not
before a slight change in direction, from a ``push'' technology
firm to one that delivers software over the Internet and networks.
</P>
<P>
   The woman-as-CEO attention was important and valuable for a new
technology company, but when the company changed direction, Polese
took the heat. Magazine and newspaper stories questioned whether
the company was more hype than reality, and since the hype centered
on her gender, Upside questions whether the criticism was sexist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think sexism was in the mix,'' Polese said in the article,
``but my reaction when I saw that was not concern about sexism but
disappointment on behalf of my company, my co-founders and our
customers. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a reaction to the oddity and the novelty of a woman
CEO. But it didn't really bother me at the end of the day because I
knew we were going to execute, I knew we were going to be
successful, and I knew we were going to kick butt.''
</P>
<P>
   Some urban legends aren't false after all
</P>
<P>
   Have you heard the one about the guy who kills himself trying to
get a can out of a soft drink machine? Unlike most so-called urban
legends, this one apparently is true.
</P>
<P>
   The Nov. 11 issue of the Journal of the American Medical
Association documents 15 cases of a soda machine falling on someone
trying to retrieve a can. Of those, 12 people were injured and
required hospitalization, and three were crushed to death.
</P>
<P>
   A Web site devoted to urban legends, www.urbanlegends
</P>
<P>
   .com, looks at some of the more interesting, intriguing and
mostly false stories making the rounds.

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   &HT;    Web pioneer follows the money
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ASPEN, Colo. _ Jim Clark is a bona fide ``been there, done that,
have the T-shirt'' member of the Silicon Valley boys club.
</P>
<P>
   First, he started Silicon Graphics, then hooked up with
University of Illinois wunderkind Marc Andreessen to found
Netscape. Clark took home a bundle after Netscape went public, then
moved on to Healtheon, the medical benefits information company
that was later acquired by Atlanta-based WebMD.
</P>
<P>
   So who better to give the keynote address to the Internet
insiders, players and pretenders at the Industry Standards'
NetReturns 2000 conference at the St. Regis Hotel? The 400-plus
attendees all turned their cell phones off and put down their
PalmPilots long enough to listen to Clark describe his personal and
extremely profitable trip down the fast lane of the information
superhighway.
</P>
<P>
   His advice to the assembled industry players was simple: Follow
your gut.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every entrepreneur knows there's one thing you need to succeed
... follow a strong gut instinct that tells you what you know can
bring about a company that sells something people will want to
buy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He also said the so-called dot-com start-ups are fortunate
because they don't have what he calls the ``Barnes &AMP; Noble
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They are encumbered by the current way of doing things,'' he
said. ``The great thing about a start-up is that you are not
encumbered. Your goal, of course, is to become encumbered.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though Clark's ventures have all been wildly successful,
he's not afraid to admit where things went wrong. Maybe it's OK to
admit where you've messed up when you have a cool billion to show
for it.
</P>
<P>
   Talking about Netscape, he said, ``After three months of talking
to Marc, I got it and I got it big,'' he said. Clark said
Netscape's ultimate failure was its focus on business customers:
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to convince newspapers and media companies and direct
marketers that the Web could be a vehicle for electronic commerce.
But it was a little early. And we threw away our portal
opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark admits where he went astray with Healtheon. ``The biggest
market I could think of was health care,'' he said. ``We built the
world's best benefits enrollment system, but not a lot of people
wanted it at that time.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with wildly successful, if slightly flawed, Web ventures
behind him, Clark isn't about to call it a day. He is still
traveling the highways and byways of Silicon Valley with a new
venture called My CFO (www.mycfo.com).
</P>
<P>
   The venture is built upon Clark's own problems managing the
millions he has amassed as a Web pioneer. As it happens, Clark has
an awful lot of money scattered around in an awful lot of places,
and he's having just the darndest time trying to keep track of it
all.
</P>
<P>
   Clark decided to go with his gut again and form a Web-based
company _ his fourth start-up. The year-old company is targeted at
an audience that Clark calls ``high-net-worth individuals with
complex financial lives.''
</P>
<P>
   My CFO's users are worth a million or more.
</P>
<P>
   ``A business wouldn't consider operating without a CFO,
controller and accountant. We're doing for the individual what
businesses have to do,'' Clark said.
</P>
<P>
   The list of investors and users of My CFO reads like a who's who
of Silicon Valley with a roster of old-money superstars including
Cisco Systems Chief Executive Officer John Chambers. And just for
being Jim Clark, he's already got backing from big-time venture
capitalists such as Kleiner Perkins and Excite At Home Chairman Tom
Jermoluk.
</P>
<P>
   Clark talked of how these high-income individuals have trouble
keeping their financial houses in order, especially when it comes
to money earned from what he termed ``wealth-generating events''
like an initial public stock offering.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Clark's enviable track record, My CFO seems to share
some of the flaws of Clark's other ventures. He's overlooked the
little people again and has underestimated the big ones. If you
have a million dollars, why can't you just hire your own
flesh-and-blood financial managers and pay for it with the cash
generated from all these ``wealth-generating events'' that seem to
happen to Silicon Valley millionaires almost daily?
</P>
<P>
   Reaction to Clark's new venture was mixed. ``I think Clark needs
to volunteer at a soup kitchen,'' cracked one attendee milling
around in the lobby during a break. ``He's been down in the Valley
pricing Ferraris, oceanfront property and sports teams too long.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Does hitting the video poker in South Carolina count as a
wealth-generating event?'' muttered one of the conference speakers.
``I don't understand what he's trying to do. It's not a Web site,
it's an intranet investment banking firm for Clark and his
friends.''
</P>
<P>
   My CFO became one of the hottest topics at the four-day
conference. It seems to have everything a turn-of-the-century Web
start-up should have: Big-time backers, super-rich users, and the
envy and resentment of every Web player who didn't think of it and
will never be rich enough to use it.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the public relations people tried to put the best
spin on My CFO.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, he's Jim Clark,'' said one of the conference organizers.
``He's done it all, and he's just having fun now. Why shouldn't
he?''
</P>
<P>
   He's just following his gut _ and following the money.

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   &HT;    Plug/no play weekend frustrating experience
 &HT;    By Gerry Yandel
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It looks as if it may be time to lighten the load on
the old Pentium 166.
</P>
<P>
   I took it with me and looked into the maw of the circuit-board
abyss. I made it back relatively OK, but I'm not sure the P166 did.
</P>
<P>
   It was a long, headache-inducing, frustration-filled trip.
Somewhere along the way, the P166 took a near-fatal hit. In fact,
its brains are still a little scrambled and it gets a faraway look
in the monitor. It all started innocently enough.
</P>
<P>
   About a week after putting in the Intel NIC, or network
interface card, which I wrote about in the last column, weird
things began to happen, and my modem started acting goofy.
</P>
<P>
   It is a U.S. Robotics 56K Winmodem, your basic generic Windows
95 plug-and-play hardware. It developed the strange habit of
answering incoming phone calls after one ring with a fax tone. So,
on a Friday afternoon, I went out and bought a Diamond Supra
voice/fax modem for $60. Late Sunday night I was looking at a dead
computer and a Win 95 CD that wasn't even useful as a coaster
because it has a hole in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   I actually enjoy opening up my P166 _ a Toshiba Infinia _ to
tinker and install new hardware. Also, I hoped to rectify my
increasingly poor MindSpring connection. In the past few weeks, the
number of disconnects has jumped from none to frequent, and when it
does stay connected, the download speeds drop to less than 200
bytes!
</P>
<P>
   Alas, the modem wasn't the answer, and slow, overloaded ISP
servers quickly became the least of my problems. I popped the top
on the P166, swapped out the USR modem for the Supra, stuck in the
CD-ROM with the new modem's drivers and turned on the juice _
waiting for Win 95 to do that magic plug-and-play trick and
discover my new hardware.
</P>
<P>
   Now, plug-and-play is really a wonderful thing (you Mac users
stop snickering). Win 95 finds your new piece of hardware, asks for
the drivers, copies them off your CD, restarts itself, and you're
plugged and you're playing.
</P>
<P>
   So I didn't expect any surprises when I opened up the Properties
on my computer and looked in the device manager. Egads!
</P>
<P>
   There were several problems. The most confusing thing was having
two COM1 ports and an unnamed COM port along with the COM2 serial
port and the LPT1 printer parallel port. On top of that, the Intel
NIC had one of those alarming yellow exclamation points Win 95 uses
as a hardware conflict alert.
</P>
<P>
   Now, I'm no greenhorn in the device manager. I've done several
modem upgrades, and have added a TV tuner card, scanners, printers
and NICs.
</P>
<P>
   So I knew all about removing conflicting devices and letting the
Win 95 plug-and-play feature find them again to reinstall the
drivers. So I did ... to no avail.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, I played plug-and-play for the rest of the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   I mean, I got into the IRQs, DMA channels, reinstalling drivers,
removing devices, you name it. I was swapping cards around into
different PCI and ISA slots _ a trick I had used successfully in
the past. I was in the Setup program, using DOS commands I forgot
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   I was doing a lot of plugging but no playing.
</P>
<P>
   Toshiba was no help. Support wanted $35 to even let me ask a
question. Forget that. I already paid them $2,200 for the machine.
They weren't getting any more of my money.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, I reached a point where trying to dial the modem
resulted in the famed Windows ``fatal exception'' and the blue
screen of death. Then it deteriorated to where I couldn't even boot
into Windows without the machine turning blue.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, I decided I had to reformat the hard drive _ after a
three-hour timeout to back up my 8-gigabyte disk.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't throw in the towel until I ran the Windows set-up
program and got a message that a CAB file was corrupt before the
setup program terminated itself. I had had enough.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, I have managed to restore my computer to a shadow of
its former self. It works fine, except that I apparently have a
conflict with my USB serial bus. And I still have that gnarly
unnamed COM port.
</P>
<P>
   I have not yet figured out what the deal is. All I can figure is
that my motherboard _ built for the first-generation Pentium chips
_ wigged out from having too many devices installed. I suppose I
will take the P166 to a pro and see what's what.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, if anyone needs a new modem, I have one for
sale cheap.

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   &HT;    Operating system upgrade will enhance multiple-user features
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ On Oct. 23, Apple will release the latest upgrade to
its Mac operating system, or OS.
</P>
<P>
   This latest upgrade, dubbed OS 9, represents evolutionary change
in Apple's venerable software that controls the look and feel of
all Macs.
</P>
<P>
   With OS 9, users will for the first time be able to create and
keep several individual configurations on one Mac. That is, two
people can share a computer but use desktops and configurations
customized to their specific tastes.
</P>
<P>
   Apple Computer officially announced OS 9 on Tuesday, but reports
about the project, code-named Sonata, and its key features have
been proliferating across the Web for months. To check out the
latest reports, visit such sites as Apple Insider, MacIntouch and
Webintosh.
</P>
<P>
   What follows is a summary of OS 9's biggest new features.
</P>
<P>
   Sonata's biggest change will be an expanded ability for Macs to
handle multiple users. With Sonata, several people will be able to
share a Mac and keep separate work environments. Those individual
working environments will be password-protected.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, no one but you _ or a system administrator if
your Mac is on a network _ will be able to change your setup. Among
the things you'll be able to customize will be look, file access
and Internet configuration.
</P>
<P>
   You can sign onto a Mac configured for multiple users via a
written password or through voice recognition. Sonata will include
a new control panel called Voice Password Assistant.
</P>
<P>
   With Voice Password, you select a spoken code word, then say it
until the system understands your voice and the code word. Then a
user can sign onto a Mac by selecting his or her name and saying
the correct password.
</P>
<P>
   Another OS feature getting an overhaul is Apple's new Sherlock
search technology. Sherlock lets users search not only their hard
drive but the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Sonata will add two new important searches to Sherlock. The
first is for people. Sherlock will search out via the Web telephone
numbers and e-mail addresses. What it finds will be listed on your
computer in the Sherlock window.
</P>
<P>
   The second new search is for e-commerce. Type the name of a
product into Sherlock. It will then search the Web for varying
prices and availability of the product, listing the results on your
computer.
</P>
<P>
   There are many more changes coming with Sonata, many of which
are minor enhancements and bug fixes.
</P>
<P>
   To learn more about this upgrade, check out Apple Insider at
www.appleinsider.com

 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   &HT;    Ghosts, goblins can find fashion advice on Web
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Web can be downright spooky at times. But there are times
when that's a good thing. If you and your family are preparing for
Halloween, you'll find almost everything you need on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Let's start with the obvious: costumes. While you can buy almost
any costume you can imagine, it's more fun (and costs less) to make
your own.
</P>
<P>
   That's why a good starting point for our ghostly tour is a Web
page called Mary's Halloween Costumes at cgi.cadvision
</P>
<P>
   .com/(tilde)burke/halloween
</P>
<P>
   /costumes.htm. Unlike many of the Halloween costume pages you'll
find, the costumes described here aren't for sale. Instead, you'll
get hints for doing it yourself.
</P>
<P>
   Some are as traditional as the easy-to-make ghost costume _ all
you need is an old white sheet _ or, for avant garde ghosts, try
something more colorful: Others are as wild as dressing a child as
a bunch of grapes (think of a grape cluster made from balloons).
</P>
<P>
   Another site that offers help with homemade costumes is
sponsored by Crayola and is located at www.familyplay.com/advice
</P>
<P>
   /mccracken/d1012.adv.html. At this site, there's some general
advice on selecting the character and safety considerations. (If
you plan to have a vampire in your household, make sure you use
plenty of reflective tape and other bright accessories so that
automobile traffic can spot the vampire easily).
</P>
<P>
   That same page also offers links to information on planning
Halloween parties and for cooking Halloween treats.
</P>
<P>
   Let's look at one last Halloween costume site before we move on
_ it's located at www.funfolly.com/h/ca01a.htm. This is a
commercial site, offering to sell costumes. The point of using this
site isn't necessarily to buy the costumes. Instead, you can use
the photographs as idea starters for the kind of costume you make
at home.
</P>
<P>
   For many kids and grown-ups, Halloween also is a time for
parties. As you would expect, there's help in party planning from
the Web, too. Halloween Games for Kids at www.geocities.com
</P>
<P>
   /NapaValley/7458/hgames.htm may give you some ideas for the sort
of entertainment to offer. Truth is, some grown-ups might get a
kick out of these games, too. One game, for instance, involves
dividing partygoers into teams, giving them a roll of toilet paper
and assigning each team to make a mummy. The best mummy wins.
</P>
<P>
   Another page offering Halloween game advice is located at
www.gamekids.com
</P>
<P>
   /hallow3.html. You'll find dozens of games (and several recipes
for party food, too) scattered around on the various links from
this page.
</P>
<P>
   Since this is the age of computer-generated party invitations,
you may need a few graphics to make your invitations look right. Or
you may have a personal Web page and be in desperate need of a
photo or drawing of a black cat, ghost or pumpkin.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, you're in luck. There are literally hundreds of Web pages
that offer graphics free for the downloading. One of these pages is
CSP Halloween Graphics at www.cyberspaceplace.com
</P>
<P>
   /halloweenbacks2.html. The only catch is that, if you use an
image on a Web page, you are asked to give credit to this site in
the form of a link.
</P>
<P>
   OK, that's our tour of the haunted Web for this week. Just save
some time to get out in the world and get some Halloween candy
which can be much more satisfying than the eye candy you'll find on
the Web.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Companies hoping to do business on the Web are being bombarded
with more ``solutions'' than ever _ all promising to provide
services that address the problem of how to set up shop online.
</P>
<P>
   And within the e-commerce sphere, the segment that ``solutions
providers'' seem to think needs the most help is the small-business
category. In fact, they may be right. According to the U.S. Small
Business Administration, only 30 percent of the nation's 24 million
small businesses accept orders on the Web, and far fewer can
process credit card transactions.
</P>
<P>
   But as more of those companies develop a full-scale Internet
presence _ and as everyone who ever had a lemonade stand decides to
sell something on the Web _e-commerce software and service
providers are competing more furiously for market share.
</P>
<P>
   One increasingly popular approach is to offer ``all-in-one''
e-commerce packages, in which merchants pay a nominal monthly fee
for software that enables them to build a site that is then hosted
by a third party _ sparing the client the cost of Web servers and
fast Internet connections.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say such services generally fall short of providing
everything businesses need to succeed on the Web, which is, of
course, what many promise to do. Still, all-in-one packages have
proved to be a good way to test the Internet waters, according to
many business people who have used them. And as more competitors
enter the market, analysts say, the quality of low-priced
e-commerce services should improve.
</P>
<P>
   Rosa Simon, for one, can attest to the wide array of low-cost
e-commerce packages available. Last year, Ms. Simon decided to
build a Web site, www.blindsdepot.com, to extend the reach of her
window-treatments business, which she had previously run by herself
selling door to door.
</P>
<P>
   A technology neophyte, Ms. Simon looked first at one of the
market leaders in one-stop e-commerce setup, Yahoo Stores. As with
other companies, Yahoo enables users to build a Web site in minutes
by filling out a series of forms online. For $100 a month, digital
entrepreneurs can post their store on Yahoo's site and offer as
many as 50 products for sale. The more products offered for sale,
the higher Yahoo's monthly fee.
</P>
<P>
   Like its competitors, which range from established companies
like IBM to Internet service providers like Hiway Technologies and
other portal sites, Yahoo offers a host of additional features. It
aggregates orders and sends them via fax to the store owner for
processing, encrypts credit card numbers during processing and
offers a shopping cart feature, so customers can pay for multiple
products at once.
</P>
<P>
   What Ms. Simon could not get from Yahoo _ or any e-commerce
provider, for that matter _ was placement high up on the results
pages of search engines. Seeking more shoppers, Ms. Simon opted for
an all-in-one package provided by iMall, which guarantees placement
on its shopping site, www.imall.com. When that also failed to
generate sales, she built a store using software provided by
Concentric Network, an Internet service provider that hosted the
site for $50 a month, and she set about learning how to manipulate
the search engines for better placement.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Concentric software tools were somewhat limited for
her purposes, Ms. Simon said, so she spent about $500 to build a
more sophisticated site with ShopSite software, from Open Market.
With the help of a consultant, she also learned how to increase her
site's visibility on search engines. The payoff, at last, came in
March, when sales started to roll. ``I'm making much more than
before,'' Ms. Simon said, though she would not disclose specific
numbers. ``And I'm working much less.''
</P>
<P>
   Jack Staff, chief economist with Zona Research, a unit of
Intelliquest, said that ``there are literally dozens of features
that are needed to make an e-commerce site work well'' beyond those
offered by the one-stop e-commerce companies. Among other things,
Staff said, small businesses need technologies to analyze customer
activity on the site, gauge the effectiveness of advertisements,
personalize the site for each visitor, build incentive programs,
offer coupons and instant discounts, confirm orders and returns and
automate e-mail responses. ``And then the real issue becomes how to
get well known with consumers,'' Staff said.
</P>
<P>
   In this regard at least, e-commerce service providers feel their
customers' pain. According to Andrew Beebe, chief executive of
Bigstep.com, which provides e-commerce services to businesses,
profitability and visibility are difficult to achieve in this
category. ``There are a lot of people doing this,'' he said, ``and
they're making a lot of noise.''
</P>
<P>
   As for profitability, Beebe said his company, which began
operations last month, ``is not making any money at all right
now.'' The plan, at least, is to provide free help to small
businesses starting e-commerce sites, then sell them more advanced
technology services along the lines of what Staff, of Zona,
described. With 20,000 small businesses currently signed up and
hundreds more being added daily, Beebe said he can negotiate
discounts from e-commerce technology providers and extract a margin
with every sale to his customers. ``But this really is going to be
a tight-margin game,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That is especially likely if his competitors keep driving the
price of services down. ``Every time someone else thinks they're
going to sell something, we're going to give it away,'' said Serge
Wilson, chief executive of Freemerchant.com, which provides
e-commerce services completely free of charge. Wilson, whose
company has signed up 20,000 merchants, earns money by offering
suppliers like the Office Max retail chain access to Freemerchant
store owners.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson sees his service as an ideal entree for people who are
not sure they want to commit thousands of dollars to an Internet
business. ``A certain percentage of our merchants will never sell
successfully,'' he said. ``It takes the right product, and time and
effort.''
</P>
<P>
   It also takes more expertise in a given category than many
e-commerce newbies are willing to develop, said Larry Erlich,
founder of Domainregistry.com, who provides consulting services to
small businesses. ``Almost without fail, the people who try to
start an e-commerce site try something they have absolutely no
expertise in,'' he said. ``They're usually involved in a business
they could probably make some money with on the Web, but they want
to do something else. It's clicks and wishes.''

IN E-COMMERCE FRENZY, BRAVE NEW WORLD MEETS OLD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   (bl)  
 By STEVE LOHR   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Amazon.com declared two weeks ago that it was beginning a
bold campaign to become an Internet shopping bazaar, Wall Street
applauded. And why not? Amazon, a corporate poster child of the New
Economy and pioneer of online retailing, would be collecting money
from any business, large or small, that wanted to set up shop under
its cyber-tent.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Amazon really needs the cash. Its losses are mounting,
as they are for most Internet merchants. But, Amazon explains, the
red ink merely underlines the scale of its ambitious investment for
future growth.
</P>
<P>
   And what is Amazon spending so lavishly on these days? Building
a high-tech bunker of supercomputers or hiring battalions of
software wizards? No, Amazon is spending much of its money on a
half-dozen huge warehouses across the country.
</P>
<P>
   The New Economy is increasingly coming face-to-face with the
old: Net code hackers and money hustlers meet the members of
Bricklayers Local 247. The hot, new fields of the Internet economy
suddenly include distribution and logistics, the humdrum backstage
of business. Indeed, as electronic commerce moves into the
mainstream _ an estimated 17 million American households will
purchase online this year _ it has prompted a new appreciation for
the business skills of the old bricks-and-mortar world.
</P>
<P>
   Customers, it seems, still have decidedly offline standards of
service. They demand timely delivery of goods and the ability to
easily return merchandise that proves disappointing, for example.
</P>
<P>
   The online retailers who come up short on those fronts, industry
analysts predict, will be casualties in the coming consolidation
among online retailers _ a Darwinian winnowing expected to begin
during this year's Christmas shopping season as winners are sorted
from losers.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the dot-com retailers are going to fold after their
venture capital money runs out,'' observed David Pecaut, a senior
vice president of the Boston Consulting Group.
</P>
<P>
   Curiously, the biggest winners in online retailing could well be
today's department stores, discount chains and specialty stores. In
fact, 62 percent of e-commerce sales are accounted for by
bricks-and-mortar and catalog companies that also have begun online
ventures. Within five years, Pecaut expects that share to rise to
85 percent as companies like Wal-Mart, Nordstrom and Sears improve
their performance on the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   The reason, he says, is that their assets from the ``legacy
world'' _ well-known brands, distribution networks, stores and
purchasing power _ will prove to be advantages, and increasingly so
in electronic commerce. The leading online brands like Amazon and
Ebay, for example, came onto the marketplace a few years ago as
innovative newcomers, when cyberspace was far less crowded and
Internet brand-building was far less costly. The chance of an
Internet start-up gaining that kind of brand recognition today,
Pecaut says, is slim.
</P>
<P>
   ``For marketers, the superior economics in the future are going
to come from the old standards of business _ and not just being
online,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The new catch phrases of modern retailing have embraced that
notion: multi-channel retailers, integrated shopping and 360-degree
marketing. All are meant to convey the concept of servicing _ or
assaulting _ the consumer on many fronts, online and off.
</P>
<P>
   Some Internet companies are even using their high-priced shares
as currency to buy bricks-and-mortar counterparts. For example, the
online auctioneer Ebay purchased Butterfield &AMP; Butterfield, a San
Francisco-based auction house founded in 1865, for $260 million in
stock earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   The statistics for online retail sales, and projections of
future revenue, show meteoric growth. Yet a closer look at the
numbers suggests how much traditional retailing retains its hold,
despite the rapid, up-from-zero growth of e-commerce. Online sales
in the United States will rise sharply this year to $20 billion and
jump to $185 billion by 2004, according to Forrester Research Inc.,
a technology research firm in Cambridge, Mass. Still, the $185
billion figure, even if it proves accurate, would represent only 7
percent of the nation's retail sales in 2004, the firm maintains.
</P>
<P>
   The rise of the Internet has clearly created not only new wealth
but a new sense of economic opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The essence of the new Internet economy is its ferocious
speed, the faith that this is a big deal and the uncertainty that
it will pay off,'' said Thomas Eisenmann, an e-commerce expert at
the Harvard Business School.
</P>
<P>
   The economic payoff from Internet technology will almost surely
come first in an area that gets the least attention: its use as a
low-cost communications technology to automate all kinds of
business transactions. ``The Amazons of the world get all the
press, but the real growth in electronic commerce in the next five
years is going to be in the business-to-business market,'' said
Peter Schwartz, chairman of the Global Business Network, a
consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   Fueling that growth will be companies using the Web instead of
faxes, telephones and face-to-face meetings to handle the ``back
office'' tasks involved in trading with their corporate customers
and suppliers. Forrester Research projects that the
business-to-business market could reach $1.5 trillion by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   But even the Internet-assisted overhaul of dealings among
businesses in the next few years represents an evolutionary instead
of a revolutionary step. Much of the anticipated transformation
amounts to doing the same chores more efficiently because of new
technology _ as was true with the telephone and, before that, the
telegraph, which has been called ``The Victorian Internet,'' in a
book published last year (Walker &AMP; Co.) by Tom Standage.
</P>
<P>
   And if the past is any guide, the surest corporate winners in
the e-commerce business may be the suppliers of basic tools and
services for the Internet: computers, software and technical
know-how. That, at least, seemed to be the lesson of the last great
gold rush in California. It was the general stores and saloons, not
the miners, that pocketed the steady money.

POP REVIEW: THE STARS GIVE A PARTY FOR A GLOBAL WEB SITE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   (nk) 
 By JON PARELES c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When is a benefit not a benefit? When it's a start-up party for
a Web site. Three all-star concerts were given on Saturday for
www.netaid.org, a Web site intended to take on not just one cause
on one occasion but long-term work on five major global issues:
poverty, the environment, human rights, refugees and poor
countries' debt. It was a way for stars to demonstrate concern
about everything from malnutrition in Bolivia to toxic oil-refinery
waste in Lake Charles, La.
</P>
<P>
   Net Aid was modeled on Live Aid, the shows in England and the
United States that raised $200 million for African famine relief in
1985. While donations were accepted (to be used for refugee relief
efforts in Kosovo and in Africa), the goal of Net Aid was primarily
to publicize the Web site. Net Aid, supervised by the U.N.
Development Program, is a clearinghouse for volunteer efforts,
donations, information on agriculture and business development and
Internet-style organizing, including an e-mail petition urging
developed countries to forgive $371 billion in third-world debt.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. concert, Net Aid New York, took place at Giants Stadium
in East Rutherford, N.J.. The nearly eight-hour show began and
ended with Wyclef Jean and Bono. They had collaborated on a song
for Net Aid, ``New Day,'' which touches on problems from
unemployment to crime to homelessness but promises, ``Sun got the
darkness on the run.'' The lineup also included Puff Daddy, Sting,
Jewel, Mary J. Blige, Busta Rhymes, Sheryl Crow, the Black Crowes,
Counting Crows, Jimmy Page, the Algerian singer Cheb Mami and the
Italian rocker Zucchero. Although nearly all the performers have
sold at least a million albums each, the scattered lineup didn't
fill the stadium; the top tier was empty, as were expanses of the
lower tiers and the field.
</P>
<P>
   Between sets, the audience at Giants Stadium saw video clips
from the two other Net Aid concerts: a packed performance at
Wembley Stadium near London, with a lineup including David Bowie,
the reunited Eurythmics, George Michael, Bush, Bryan Adams, the
Corrs and Robbie Williams, and an invitation-only event at the
Palais des Nations in Geneva with Bryan Ferry and Des'ree, which
was attended by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan. The concerts
were broadcast on radio stations in 132 countries and shown on VH1
and MTV in the United States and on the BBC. A two-hour show of
excerpts is scheduled for Wednesday night at 8 on the TNT cable
network.
</P>
<P>
   With television cameras transmitting to an international
audience, the musicians didn't stint on production values. They
brought full bands, choirs, string orchestras and, for Puff Daddy,
pyrotechnics. They also refrained from profanity.
</P>
<P>
   Some stars brought out their most earnest, idealistic anthems.
Bono _ dressed in a quasi-military uniform and wearing a cap from
Jubilee 2000, an organization pressing for debt forgiveness _ sang
``One'' with a string orchestra conducted by Quincy Jones,
insisting, ``We got to carry each other.'' Jewel declaimed like a
gospel preacher in ``Life Uncommon,'' which grows militant: ``There
is a new army coming and we are armed with faith/To live, we must
give.''
</P>
<P>
   Others just treated their short sets as condensed versions of a
regular show. The guitarist Jimmy Page rocked the stadium with
time-tested arena fare when he played his old Led Zeppelin songs
while Chris Robinson, of the Black Crowes, sang as much as he could
like Robert Plant; Robinson, a Southerner, was imitating an
Englishman who emulated Southern blues singers. Mary J. Blige
lavished her voice on songs about romantic strife, as her vows and
pleas gave way to wordless, virtuosic swoops, blending the cutting
tone of Dinah Washington with the gutsiness of Gladys Knight. Busta
Rhymes set off one party chant after another, machine-gunning
syllables and racing around the stage.
</P>
<P>
   Net Aid is touted as the largest Web site to date, showing off
technology from Cisco Systems, which contributed more than $10
million to the site; it claims the ability to handle one million
connections a minute. The concerts were shown on the Internet,
through an electronic network 10 times larger than the previous
largest Webcasts (for Victoria's Secret and the opening of the 1998
Olympics), able to send out 125,000 video streams simultaneously.
But on a home computer with a 56K modem, sound and video quality
were still murky, and network traffic made connections difficult in
some areas. Douglas Graham, who oversaw the design and software of
the Web site for KPMG, ascribed the problems to local Internet
providers and high Internet use on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Even more than Live Aid, the Net Aid concert drove home stark
contrasts between the haves, onstage and in the audience, and the
have-nots. Puff Daddy's songs celebrated material success _ the
Mercedes, the cell phones _ but then, in a burst of piousness,
insisted there's more to life than a platinum Rolex. He was the
concert's prime showman, with a white piano, a white-robed gospel
choir, puffs of flame and two guest hard-rock guitarists to show
he's keeping up with the metal-rap trend: Slash of Guns 'n' Roses
and Page, who let Puff Daddy turn Led Zeppelin's ``Kashmir'' into a
wounded lover's rant.
</P>
<P>
   Video clips, shown during equipment changes, detailed harrowing
situations and statistics: arms hacked off during Sierra Leone's
civil war, 22 million refugees, 800 million people chronically
undernourished, 1.3 billion people in extreme poverty. They made
for some bizarre juxtapositions. Immediately after a segment on
teen-age prostitution and drug addiction in Russia, a video clip of
the Corrs at Wembley was shown. ``It really doesn't matter if we
don't eat/It really doesn't matter if we never sleep,'' they sang,
`` 'Cause we are so young now.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly absent from the concerts was any music from the countries
that Net Aid is intended to help most. Sting made an effort by
turning over a song (and his band) to Cheb Mami, an Algerian rai
singer with an expressive, fine-pointed voice. And Jean,
over-reaching his limited skills on guitar, tried to cover the
United States (with rap, rockabilly and blues) and the Caribbean
(with ``Guantanamera'' and a version of ``Hot, Hot, Hot'' that
turned the original soca into a Haitian compas). As cyberspace is
now, Net Aid was a sphere of the affluent, but one that envisions
affecting the whole world.

A SATELLITE MODEL FOR STREAMING MEDIA;   
 ONLINE CREMATIONS  
 CREATIVE LABS ADOPTS WINDOWS AUDIO FORMAT
</HEADLINE>
 
(Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  
(ATTN: Calif., Fla.)  (nk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the Internet moves to broad band, the market for Internet
audio and video, so-called streaming media, is expected to explode.
But congestion associated with this bandwidth-hogging traffic can
crash Web sites, drown out conventional traffic and degrade the
quality of the sound or picture.
</P>
<P>
   And so iBEAM, a start-up backed by the likes of Intel, hopes to
address these problems with an ambitious plan to deliver
high-quality streaming media over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The company, based in Sunnyvale, Calif., begins formal
operations this week. It relies on a cable-television distribution
model: using satellite broadcast technology to take a single stream
of data and direct it to a network of server computers spread
around the Internet. The audio and video can be either delivered
live by satellite or stored on servers for delivery on demand.
</P>
<P>
   The iBEAM servers are at the edges of the Internet. So its
satellite approach, while not a remedy to congestion problems, at
least avoids the costs and congestion associated with so-called
Internet backbone networks. ``Our hope is that we will be as big as
traditional media,'' said Tom Gillis, iBEAM's assistant vice
president for marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than charging Internet service providers for the service,
iBEAM intends to charge only the content providers, which would
then recoup their expenditures with advertising revenues from
iBEAM's targeted advertising service. The company has already
equipped 60 Internet service providers with servers capable of Web
casting to a total audience of 300,000, with 90 more installations
expected later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Many content providers have signed on, including BBC and
Bloomberg News, Gillis said, adding that MSNBC, Sony Tristar,
Warner Bros. and Warner Interactive were expected to join soon.
Gillis also said that iBEAM was in talks with the three big
television networks.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts said that while iBEAM's approach was clever and
its partnerships impressive, they did not expect the satellite
distribution model to prevail in the long term. ``It's exciting,
but it's a stopgap,'' said Michael Kleeman, an independent
telecommunications industry consultant.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, iBEAM has received more than $60 million in
investments from companies like Intel and Liberty Media and venture
capitalists like Accel Partners and Crosspoint Venture Partners,
and is close to announcing investments with Microsoft and Sony,
Gillis said.

   A Company Sells Cremations Online
</P>
<P>
   The Neptune Society, which sells cremations online, calls itself
``the hottest e-commerce Web site of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   And given the upward trajectory of Internet use and the aging of
the huge baby boom generation, Neptune Society executives may have
found a market niche. When the company began selling cremations on
the Web on Oct. 1 (www.neptunesociety.com), it said it was serving
a growing market in the most logical place.
</P>
<P>
   ``With 76 million baby boomers starting to age and pass away and
with baby boomers being one of the fastest-growing demographics on
the Internet, the Web is just a perfect place for us to be,'' said
Gary R. Loffredo, Neptune Society's vice president for marketing.
</P>
<P>
   For those wondering exactly how to handle a cremation in
cyberspace, Loffredo explained that customers can pay for a future
service or arrange for one ``at the time of need.''
</P>
<P>
   In either case, customers can choose among options for
transportation of the body ($200), preparation of the body ($320)
and, of course, the cremation itself ($480 to $585, depending on
the container). Customers may have the ashes scattered at sea for
$75 to $575.
</P>
<P>
   Loffredo said the service was now available in California and
Florida and the company hoped to expand quickly. He attributed an
increase in sales last month to the memorial services held this
summer for John F. Kennedy Jr., Carolyn Bessette Kennedy and Lauren
Bessette.
</P>
<P>
   And in general, Loffredo said, cremation was growing in
popularity. Roughly 15 percent of those who died in the United
States in 1987 chose cremation, compared with 24 percent in 1997.
``And by 2010, it will be 42 percent,'' he said. ``What better
product to offer on line than the prepayment of the cremation
service?''

   Creative Labs Adopts Windows Audio Format
</P>
<P>
   Digging deeper into the digital music market, Microsoft said
last week that Creative Labs' Nomad II portable player, scheduled
for release in January, would be able to store and play music in
the Windows Media Audio format.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement followed several agreements Microsoft had
forged with equipment makers in this market. Diamond Multimedia,
the leading portable player manufacturer, announced future support
for Windows Media in June. Late last month, Cirrus Logic announced
that it was offering a new line of chips that would automatically
support the Windows Media format. Microsoft is trying to establish
Windows Media Audio as a de facto industry standard for digital
music formats that provide copyright protection. Currently, MP3,
the most popular digital audio format, does not provide such
protection all by itself.
</P>
<P>
   Creative Labs, which says it is the No. 2 portable player maker,
would not say what brand of chip its new player would use. But
whatever the chip, the device would support Windows Media, the
company said. A company spokeswoman said the new Nomad would be
programmable, meaning that if Creative supported more software
formats in the future, customers would be able to update their
players to accept music in those formats.
</P>
<P>
   Is Microsoft sewing up the market for secure digital formats?
``Absolutely not,'' said Mark Mooradian, a senior analyst with
Jupiter Communications. ``The day when you hear five major labels
are encoding their catalogs in Windows Media and nothing else is
the day Microsoft has sewn up the market.''

   CUPERTINO, Calif. _ Much has been said and written about the
turnaround at Apple Computer Inc. in recent years, as measured by
its return to profitability, the resurgence of its share price and
the explosive sales of its fruit-colored iMac machines. But in
fact, the seeds of Apple Computer's remarkable renaissance were
sown in a contentious meeting that took place here in January 1997
and that involved the unsung part of Apple's business: software.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting was held only days after Apple's chairman at the
time, Gilbert Amelio, purchased Steven Jobs' Next Computer. Next's
chief software designer, Avidis Tevanian, was huddling for the
first time with Apple's top engineers. The session, according to
several people who participated, escalated into a shouting match
between Tevanian and the head of Copland _Apple's troubled effort
to create a next-generation operating system.
</P>
<P>
   As Tevanian recalls the meeting, he simply stated that he was in
charge and that, because he had a deep technical grounding in
computer science, it would be impossible for programmers to pull
the wool over his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   But to several of Apple's beleaguered managers, it sounded as if
Tevanian was arrogantly telling them that Next had just acquired
Apple and that he was taking over.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever actually transpired, Tevanian recalls leaving the
meeting with the belief that Apple's technical culture was severely
flawed. ``There were people who were saying, `We're going to work
on what's cool and we're not going to be held accountable,''' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Today that is an impression of Apple Computer that no longer
applies.
</P>
<P>
   Tevanian won the confrontation, the Copland effort was
subsequently scrapped and most of Apple's software managers were
forced from the company.
</P>
<P>
   The revamping of Apple's software effort is the untold story
behind Apple's turnaround, which has led to two consecutive
profitable years; a rebound from the single digits to more than 10
percent in the company's PC industry market share, and Apple's
buoyant stock price, which closed on Friday at $65.5625, more than
double its price 52 weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, while almost all of the reporting on Apple's reversal in
the wake of Amelio's ouster and Jobs' return to Apple as ``acting''
chief executive in July 1997 has focused on the company's
reinvigorated industrial design, new products and glitzy marketing,
it is the story of the steady improvement of Apple's existing
Macintosh software operating system that has done the most to
solidify the company's loyal customers, while giving the computer
maker a means for attracting new ones.
</P>
<P>
   And while Jobs, 44, has carefully presented himself as the
single public face of the revitalized computer maker (which he
co-founded in 1976), it is Tevanian, 38, working largely outside of
the public eye, who has re-energized Apple's programming force and
sharpened its efforts.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 23, Apple plans to begin shipping Mac OS 9, the fifth
upgrade of its operating system software since Tevanian came to
Apple.
</P>
<P>
   Such a prolific series of updates bespeaks a discipline and
efficiency that is not only new for Apple, but rare in the software
industry. And the new operating system will have a range of new
features that are expected to be highly attractive to current and
potential Macintosh users. Significantly, too, a number of the new
wrinkles, including an improved version of its Sherlock search
tool, seamless Internet file sharing and a simple password
``keyring'' that keeps all of a user's security information in one
place, are innovations not found in Microsoft's industry-dominant
Windows operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the new version comes as Microsoft is visibly struggling
with its own software development system, and the computer industry
is watching carefully to see how quickly and completely Microsoft
will be able to ship a more solid and bug-free version of its
Windows NT operating system, recently renamed Windows 2000.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Microsoft executives acknowledge that they are well aware of
Apple's new software virtuosity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've noticed,'' said Yusuf Mehdi, a Microsoft executive who
ran the company's marketing effort for Windows 98. ``They've gotten
their software act together.''
</P>
<P>
   But the best testimony comes from Apple's software developers _
the outside programmers who create software that runs on the Mac OS
and who are benefiting from Apple's rising computer sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apple developers like to complain and it was easy to complain
in the early 1990s,'' said David Shayer, a developer at Sentient
Software, a small Macintosh software firm in San Carlos, Calif.
``But although I may not like Steve Jobs, I'm selling software.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The change at Apple is largely the result of a rare chemistry
between Jobs and Tevanian. Jobs is legendary for both his aesthetic
sense, which is not often found in the computer industry, and his
willingness to take risks and gamble on new and unproven
technology. Tevanian has a reputation for staying focused and being
pragmatic.
</P>
<P>
   Jobs lectured his original team of Apple Macintosh programmers
that ``real artists ship.''
</P>
<P>
   Tevanian has adopted a variation of that theme. ``Shipping
software is a good thing,'' he said during a recent interview in
his office, where he sits surrounded by computer monitors.
</P>
<P>
   Over 13 years of working together, initially in the face of
adversity at Next, which was never financially successful, Jobs'
well-chronicled mercurial qualities have been matched by the
ability of Tevanian, who is known as Avie, to be the consummate
engineering manager _ tough but even-keeled. Significantly, it was
Tevanian and not Jobs who took the witness stand earlier this year
during the Microsoft antitrust trial to recount the story of
Apple's bitter behind-the-scenes dealings with Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   The two men met in the mid-1980s, after Jobs lost his battle for
control of Apple Computer with its president, John Sculley, when
Macintosh sales were slow to take off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was traveling to different campuses trying to get a better
understanding of the education marketplace and Avie was a starving
graduate student, so I took him to dinner,'' Jobs recalled. At the
time, Tevanian was already well known in elite computer science
circles for his role in developing a modernized version of the Unix
operating system, known as Mach, while he was at Carnegie Mellon
University.
</P>
<P>
   Jobs wooed Tevanian by telling him that he was willing to bet
his new computer company Next on the Mach software. In return,
Tevanian agreed to join the small start-up, turning down a
competing job offer from Microsoft.

DIGITAL COMMERCE: TAKING TECHNOLOGY TO AFRICA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  (lb) 
 By DENISE CARUSO    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The technology sector's financial success in the last three
years has been largely a North American phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   But some forward-thinking investors have been moving offshore
toward untapped markets and investments, often pushing
communication technologies into underdeveloped countries in Latin
America and Asia.
</P>
<P>
   On foreign soil, U.S. investment often looks _ and acts _
remarkably like invasion. And it is sometimes treated accordingly,
as cellular-telephone providers discovered last year when the
Chinese government abruptly terminated a number of successful joint
ventures with vendors like Motorola and Ericsson in favor of its
own technologies.
</P>
<P>
   So how will U.S. investors, particularly those drunk on their
recent good fortune and feeling perhaps a little invincible,
henceforth enter these raw new markets? The answer to that question
may determine which nations are pulled into the global market and
which are left behind.
</P>
<P>
   Some areas, notably much of Africa, might even welcome an
invasion of foreign technology investment.
</P>
<P>
   With nearly 800 million people in nearly 50 countries speaking
hundreds of dialects and often in conflict with one another, Africa
has attracted almost no technology investment. Add to those
problems the continent's relatively high levels of poverty and
illiteracy, and the risk-reward ratio is not exactly compelling.
</P>
<P>
   Yet people like Noah Samara are willing, and even eager, to take
the risk.
</P>
<P>
   After 10 years of planning and development, Samara, the
Ethiopian-born founder and chairman of Worldspace Corp. in
Washington, began broadcasting digital radio programming from his
company's Afristar satellite on Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Afristar, the first of three Worldspace satellites (two more
serving Asia and Latin America are to be launched in 2000), is the
first satellite to deliver simultaneous programming to the entire
African continent.
</P>
<P>
   If all three satellites are in orbit by the end of next year,
Worldspace's potential audience will be more than 4.8 billion
people.
</P>
<P>
   Worldspace was conceived when, while practicing law in
Washington, Samara saw the AIDS epidemic ravaging Africa. People
desperately needed information to stem the spread of the virus, he
realized, but distributing printed materials was expensive and
impractical in a continent with so many remote areas and such
illiteracy, and television sets were rare and were too expensive
for most Africans.
</P>
<P>
   Samara's answer was the world's first portable satellite media
receiver: a digital radio that connects with various power sources,
including solar panels for poor, rural areas, as well as to PCs and
printers.
</P>
<P>
   The receivers, manufactured by Matsushita's Panasonic and JVC
subsidiaries, Hitachi and Sanyo, cost about $250 today, Samara
said. That seems prohibitively expensive, but he said that ``once
you start introducing new products and services, people start
working harder to make sure they can benefit from the
conveniences.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've calculated the number of families in our coverage area
that can afford receivers at these prices,'' he added. ``We
designed the African satellite's footprint to cover the more
affluent Middle East, as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Why radios and not the Internet? Digital radio was the only
solution that made sense, he insisted, because it was the cheapest,
most efficient way to reach the widest population, from poor,
illiterate rural villages to more affluent urban areas.
</P>
<P>
   It was also the most adaptable, he said, because the digital
radios could also receive data, like documents and static Web
pages.
</P>
<P>
   Worldspace, with $1.2 billion of investments, primarily from
Saudi backers, hopes to make money by selling time on the
satellites to various broadcasters, and by offering pay services of
its own.
</P>
<P>
   Today, these include Time Warner's CNN International and
Bloomberg Financial News as well as national and indigenous
broadcasts from countries like Egypt, Ghana, Senegal and South
Africa. But more interesting than its commercial services is its
goal of creating markets by fighting poverty.
</P>
<P>
   A central part of Samara's strategy was setting aside 5 percent
of his satellites' capacity for a nonprofit organization called
Equal Access, which Worldspace started with Solaria, a solar-energy
equipment provider and the State of the World Forum
(www.worldforum.org), a nonprofit global leadership and education
organization formed by Mikhail Gorbachev in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Equal Access aspires to provide free digital radios and a rich
flow of basic information, including educational and health
programming, to the poorest African villages, at a net cost of $10
a user.
</P>
<P>
   Its strategy is to get money directly from organizations like
UNESCO and the World Bank, which have millions of dollars earmarked
for poverty-eradication programs.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   An early project will be a Pan-African, noncommercial news
program, in the tradition of National Public Radio. Samara calls it
``the voice of Africa talking to the people of Africa.''
</P>
<P>
   And because the Worldspace radio receiver can also connect with
a PC and a printer, even remote villages would be able to receive
multimedia data for distance learning and health programs as well
as school curriculums in multiple languages.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most critical project for Equal Access, says Tom
Rautenberg, director of strategy and program development for State
of the World Forum, is a broadcasting service for women and
families.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've learned from World Bank studies that the education of
women and girls is probably the most critical variable in
sustainable development,'' Rautenberg says. ``Their status and
economic potential is a leading indicator of how that community is
doing and its potential for the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Samara is dedicated to changing the lives of Africans
and others in developing countries, he argues that the strategy
makes business sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought a lot about how to subsidize the development of the
poorest part of the market,'' he said. ``People need so many things
in these areas _ information on hygiene, how to be better
entrepreneurs, a whole range of issues. If we can do that, we will
help them break through some of the hardest barriers.''

UNDATED: Infrastructure Project.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The industry has financed independent privacy monitoring
organizations, like eTrust and BBB Online. Even so, enforcement
remains an issue for privacy groups and in negotiations between the
United States and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   To date, much of the development of privacy practices online has
been by the marketplace, responding to complaints, often by the
thousands. In 1997, for example, when word spread that America
Online planned to pass along customers' telephone numbers to
telemarketers and other direct-sales merchants, the big Internet
service provider heard a consumer outcry _ and quickly dropped the
plan.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Likewise Amazon.com, the big online bookstore, ran into a
backlash last month when it posted ``purchase circles,'' which
showed the book buying habits of users from selected companies and
universities. Some users found this a breach of privacy without
consent and asked to be removed. After asking employees for their
reaction, IBM Chairman Louis V. Gerstner Jr. received 5,000 e-mail
responses within hours. More than 90 percent objected to having
their book-buying habits as a group disclosed online.
</P>
<P>
   IBM was removed from the book-purchase circles. Later, Gerstner
wrote to Jeff Bezos, chief executive of Amazon.com, saying, ``I'm
certainly not going to tell you how to run your business, but I do
urge you to view this as an enormously important issue.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Some online privacy issues have surfaced case by case. Last
year, for example, a customer service representative at America
Online told a Navy investigator the real name of a naval officer
who had identified himself by the screen name ``Tim'' and listed
his marital status as ``gay.'' Later, America Online reached an
out-of-court settlement with the officer and adopted new policies
to protect the privacy of its customers. America Online's thousands
of customer service representatives are now given special
``scenario training'' to insure that they do not give out private
information about users without the users' consent or a court
order.
</P>
<P>
   This trial-and-error, market-driven approach to privacy,
Internet executives note, has often resulted in stricter practices
than those, for example, of the credit card and catalog industries.
Besides, they add, a rapid response system for customers is built
into the Internet, where e-mail complaining and chat room
organizing can punish companies more quickly and more severely than
government regulations can.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the day, good privacy policy is good business
for us,'' said Robert Pittman, president of America Online. ``It's
very important to our members. We've learned that anything you do,
you have to think through the prism of privacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not always perfect,'' Pittman added. ``But if we miss
something, our members tell us in one big hurry.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Most online consumers, apparently, are willing to fend for
themselves on the increasingly commercial Internet. A survey by
Privacy and American Business, a research firm, found that 86
percent of 460 adult Internet users questioned earlier this year
said they wanted to be able to essentially ``trade'' their own
personal information with Web sites _ as long as they were properly
informed about how their data were used and were offered benefits
for doing so.
</P>
<P>
   Pitofsky, the FTC chairman, points to those survey results as
the reason he is ``willing to be patient to see if self-regulation
works.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Yet many people argue that some basic legislation to protect
individual privacy on the Internet is inevitable _ and that it
could both benefit consumers and stimulate the growth of e-commerce
by fostering greater public trust in doing business on line. Such
sentiments extend well beyond the traditional champions of
government intervention like privacy advocates and consumer groups.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Berners-Lee, the British physicist who created the basic
software for the Web, is the director of the World Wide Web
Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. His
consortium is working on privacy-enhancing technology, software
that holds a person's privacy preferences and can communicate and
bargain on an individual's behalf over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Berners-Lee said: ``On privacy, I don't think that
self-regulation is enough. In America, I believe that the lack of
regulation means that the corporate marketers have too much
power.''
</P>
<P>
   That power seems certain to increase in the near future. The
spread of Internet technology will result in a data collection
network of previously unimagined reach as telephones, televisions,
cars and appliances _ not just personal computers _ are connected
to the global digital network before long. And the rapidly
developing fields of data-mining and profiling software will enable
corporations to increasingly slice and search through this ocean of
data to identify personal patterns of buying and behavior _ and
make inferences, accurate or not, about a person's likely behavior.
</P>
<P>
   The unnerving prospect, according to Paul Saffo, a director for
the Institute for the Future, is that ``we will all be players in
what could be a fairly inaccurate virtual Truman Show.''
</P>
<P>
   At stake, technologists say, is far more than who gets which
Internet marketing pitches. Profiling, they say, could be employed
to determine who gets _ and who is excluded from _ all kinds of
opportunities like jobs, housing and education.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC is also studying the use and potential abuse of
increasingly powerful Internet software. The commission has
scheduled a public workshop on ``online profiling'' in November.
</P>
<P>
   Digital red-lining, Ms. Varney says, is an evocative term and a
troubling concept.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question that this technology could be hugely
invasive,'' she said. ``But it could also be enormously empowering
by allowing individuals to make their own choices and by saving us
all time and money. Particularly in the future, we will face more
difficult decisions and trade-offs. But I think that argues for
leaving those decisions to the marketplace for privacy as much as
we can.''

EASING ON SOFTWARE EXPORTS HAS LIMITS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  (lb) 
 By PETER WAYNER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the Clinton administration recently announced plans to
relax restrictions on exports of data-scrambling software, a key
issue that escaped notice was that the new policies affect only
shrink-wrapped software, not the original source code _ the lines
of instructions that programmers actually write.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to source code, the undersecretary of commerce for
export administration, William Reinsch, said last week that
``nothing has changed.''
</P>
<P>
   The exclusion of source code from the relaxed rules threatens to
constrain software developed under the so-called open-source model,
most notably the Linux operating system, an upstart competitor to
Microsoft's Windows.
</P>
<P>
   Linux and other open-source programs are created by loose-knit
coalitions of programmers around the world who exchange source
codes. Many of these teams have developed unusually error-free
software in part because access to the source code allows each
programmer to find colleagues' mistakes, improve on a program's
efficiency, offer fixes for bugs and add new features.
</P>
<P>
   Before software written in any of today's more sophisticated
programming languages can run on a computer, it must be compiled, a
process that translates the text of the source code into
combinations of ones and zeros that can be understood by a
microprocessor.
</P>
<P>
   Once a program is compiled, it is almost impossible to determine
what the original source code was. Thus it cannot be adapted or
modified by other programmers unless the source code itself is
published.
</P>
<P>
   This happens to suit U.S. government intelligence and
law-enforcement agencies, which worry that access to the source
code for encryption and security software would enable terrorists,
drug dealers and other criminals to devise secure communications
networks that agents would not be able to monitor.
</P>
<P>
   Last May, Attorney General Janet Reno wrote to the German
justice minister, Herta Daeubler-Gmelin, asking for her help in
writing new regulations to control the proliferation of the source
code for encryption software that is distributed over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, the government is increasingly turning to
open-source software to build secure communications networks that
protect government secrets or citizens' privacy. Of particular note
is a cousin of Linux known as OpenBSD, which is popular in
government agencies because its development team conducted
unusually rigorous security audits to anticipate and plug holes
that attackers might use to gain entry.
</P>
<P>
   While it might seem logical that the hidden code in compiled
software would offer greater security than code that anyone can
read, many security experts argue that the opposite is true. Open
source, they say, is ultimately more secure because the people
writing security software know exactly how the systems they are
protecting run.
</P>
<P>
   Theo de Raadt, the leader of the OpenBSD development team, said
last week that his group's software had been bought by many
laboratories and agencies. ``I went down a list,'' he said, ``and
it includes hundreds of them.'' He refused to name the agencies but
said it was fair to assume that the list included some of the
government's most security-conscious operations.
</P>
<P>
   OpenBSD is also used as the basis for many security
applications. For example, Network Flight Recorder, based in
Washington, makes a device that monitors activity on a network,
watching for packets of data that suggest suspicious or forbidden
activity.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that by the government's definitions, OpenBSD is
foreign software. De Raadt lives in Calgary, Alberta, and he uses
many Canadian programmers to add security enhancements. He said
that the more liberal rules of the Canadian government made it
possible for his team to pursue absolute security without fear that
the government would regulate it. The OpenBSD CD-ROM bears a label
boasting, ``Made in Canada, Land of Free Cryptography.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Internet and software development defy the notion of
national boundaries. OpenBSD originated at the University of
California at Berkeley (the BSD stands for ``Berkeley software
distribution''). De Raadt led the push to increase the security by
adding software in Canada that could not be exported by developers
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, several key security enhancements came from programmers
in the United States. For example, the Naval Research Lab in
Virginia is using OpenBSD as a foundation of its new IPv6 project,
an attempt to increase the security of both the Internet in general
and the secure parts of the global network used by the military.
</P>
<P>
   No open-source development can be a made-in-America project. The
Naval Research Lab's Web page thanks several Italians who
contributed some of the source code that works with OpenBSD.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the Navy's project is built with Italian enhancements to a
Canadian product that was born in a U.S. university. What is more,
it is likely that the software contains pieces of code contributed
by programmers in Finland, Germany, Eastern Europe, Russia,
Australia, India, Mexico and other countries.
</P>
<P>
   Many security professionals argue that the nationality of a
piece of source code is irrelevant, that what matters is achieving
a blend of software produced by the best minds everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Gregory Perry, the chief technology officer of Network Security
Technology in Herndon, Va., said that OpenBSD is the most secure
operating system in the world. He added that his company already
used it for many projects and was exploring commercializing the
system or selling expert support.
</P>
<P>
   The appeal is not only security but cost. Marcus Ranum, chief
executive of Network Flight Recorder, said the OpenBSD operating
system enabled his engineers to read the source code, check for
bugs and build a very secure tool for detecting attackers. If the
attorney general succeeds in persuading the Europeans and Canadians
to shut off the flow of open-source security software, he said, ``I
think it would be a tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   But in case Reno has her way, the software industry is
developing end runs. The administration, for example, has so far
declined to regulate the international movement of source code if
it is printed on paper, presumably out of concern that such
regulation would violate the First Amendment. Thus, several
companies are already shipping printouts of their code to Europe
where it is scanned into computers.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about the policy's impact on the development of
Linux, FreeBSD, and other open-source projects that serve the
government's own needs, Reinsch, the commerce undersecretary, said:
``It's an important question which we need to study a lot more. We
don't have all of the answers.''

Next when Tevanian came aboard in 1988, fresh from Carnegie Mellon
with a Ph.D. in computer science. He recalls Tevanian as being
``self-confident and bright'' and quickly rising to run Next's
software operating system group.
</P>
<P>
   ``A key quality, shared by many who successfully work for Steve
Jobs, is that he could definitely hold his own with Steve,''
Tribble said. ``I think Steve admires that, as long as it is clear
that the person really knows what they are talking about.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Tevanian's friends say that for many years, during which Next's
software received high technical marks but failed to catch hold in
the PC marketplace, Tevanian would often speak wistfully about the
large number of Microsoft stock options he had forgone by signing
on with Next. But Tevanian's patience has been vindicated. In 1997,
when he left Next to come to Apple, he received almost 400,000
Apple stock options, potentially worth $27 million at the stock's
current price.
</P>
<P>
   But then it is Tevanian's role in bringing new rigor to Apple's
software operation that has had much to do with the company's
improved financial standing. Apple's operating system strategy,
which is based on shipping a major release each year and a minor
upgrade six months later, is already contributing significantly to
the company's profitability. Although the numbers are not reported
separately in Apple's annual report, Jobs said last week that Mac
OS was now contributing $50 million a year in profit to the
computer maker, which had $300 million in total profit in 1998.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Turning Apple's decade-and-a-half-old operating system into a
cash cow has been one of Jobs' cleverest accomplishments since
returning to Apple. When he sold Next to Apple in late 1996, many
people in the computer industry expected that Apple would simply
replace its aging Mac OS with Nextstep, the elegant but
commercially unsuccessful operating system developed by Tevanian.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Jobs has chosen an approach of gradually trickling the
Next technology into the Mac OS, while continually pushing back the
introduction of a completely new operating system, now known within
the company as Mac OS X.
</P>
<P>
   Jobs said in a recent interview that customer test versions of
Mac OS X would appear early next year, but that a final version
would not reach the market until later in 2000 _ a significant
delay, compared with the original timetable, which called for the
new system to appear by the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Several former and present Macintosh software engineers, who
would speak only if they were not identified, said the company
still had an imposingly large amount of work left to finish on the
project. That would suggest that Jobs and Tevanian, for all their
success in updating the current Mac OS, may have simply succeeded
in delaying the same crucial transition that the company failed to
make nearly three years ago, when it canceled its ambitious but
troubled Copland project.
</P>
<P>
   But rather than merely delaying a potentially wrenching
transition, Jobs contends that he realized there was still plenty
of potential growth in the existing Mac OS.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realized that we were the owners and caretakers of one of
only two high-volume operating systems in the world, and that this
was a wonderful place to be,'' he said.

 By STEVE LOHR c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   By the stilted linguistic standards of government reports, the
Federal Trade Commission gave the online industry a pistol whipping
in June 1998. After reviewing the privacy practices of World Wide
Web sites, the commission told Congress that the industry had
``fallen far short of what is needed to protect consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   Only a tiny fraction of Web sites, the FTC noted, told people
what the sites did with the personal information they collected _
names, e-mail addresses, credit card numbers. Even fewer sites
offered consumers any choice about how their personal data were
used, allowed them to access the data or gave assurances of its
security.
</P>
<P>
   Industry self-regulation, the FTC concluded, was not working.
</P>
<P>
   Its scathing report increased the chances that Congress would
enact sweeping Internet privacy legislation. And the findings
hardened resolve in Europe to reject the American self-regulatory
approach to privacy online, a dispute that threatened to escalate
into the first Internet trade war.
</P>
<P>
   Christine Varney, the commission's Internet activist until she
left in August 1997, had long warned the industry that if it did
not move to shoulder responsibility on privacy, the government
would surely step in. Suddenly, that threat seemed imminent.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, two months before the FTC report was released, a group of
companies had already taken a collective first step toward trying
to shore up the Internet industry's credibility on privacy, fend
off regulation and deflect a trade war with Europe.
</P>
<P>
   On April 17, 1998, some 60 lawyers, lobbyists and executives
gathered in an 11th floor conference room at IBM's Washington
office, representing several companies that included America
Online, IBM, Hewlett-Packard and Microsoft, plus a few trade groups
like the Direct Marketing Association.
</P>
<P>
   There was a sense of urgency at that afternoon meeting. ``We
realized we had to make a lot of progress in a short time on the
privacy issue,'' recalled Marc Berejka, Microsoft's manager of
government affairs.
</P>
<P>
   The group formed that day, the Online Privacy Alliance, now has
nearly 100 corporations and associations as members, and it has
done a remarkable job in turning the public debate over Internet
privacy in the industry's direction.
</P>
<P>
   And in a switch of roles of the kind so unremarkable in
Washington, the person heading the industry alliance, as its legal
counsel and spokeswoman, is Ms. Varney, the same FTC commissioner
who led the government's efforts to safeguard privacy on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Her success, privacy advocates say, has been as a Washington
insider guiding a shrewd campaign of persuasion and not, as the
industry alliance asserts, in prodding online companies to adopt
meaningful privacy policies.
</P>
<P>
   But even her critics admire her work. ``Christine Varney has
been enormously effective in her role _ she's a cheerleader for an
industry self-regulatory approach that she believes in,'' said Marc
Rotenberg, executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information
Center, a civil liberties advocacy group. ``The problem is that you
now have the government taking its lead from industry on the
privacy issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Judgments about the Online Privacy Alliance vary. But there is
no disputing that the group has strengthened the standing of those
who believe that a hands-off approach is the wisest Internet
policy. The group has blunted the drive for broad Internet privacy
legislation or strict government regulation. Its efforts have won
praise from the FTC. And the group has even made headway on
impressing Europe's trade negotiators.
</P>
<P>
   ``The jury is still out as to whether self-regulation will work,
but there is no doubt that the industry has made a lot of progress
on the Internet privacy issue in the last year or so,'' said Robert
Pitofsky, chairman of the FTC. ``And if the industry keeps making
as much progress as it has recently, I don't see how you can really
argue that we need legislation.''
</P>
<P>
   The 43-year-old Ms. Varney, who served as secretary to the
Cabinet in the Clinton White House before joining the FTC in
October 1994, is a lawyer at Hogan &AMP; Hartson, a Washington law
firm, where she is building an Internet-law practice. Her pedigree
made Ms. Varney very attractive to the companies assembling the
industry privacy group.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was perfect,'' said Jill Lesser, vice president for
domestic public policy for America Online Inc. ``She had really
pushed this issue at the FTC, so she had credibility with
government and with consumer groups.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Varney has no qualms about her labors on the industry's
behalf. She sees her role as a continuation of her work as a
privacy advocate and not as a compromise of the principles she
espoused during her government service.
</P>
<P>
   She is not opposed to regulation per se, Ms. Varney says, and
she urged the industry alliance to get ahead of its critics by
pushing for a privacy law tailored for children. The industry group
did encourage Congress to enact the Children's On-Line Privacy
Protection Act of 1998, passed last October, which requires Web
sites to obtain parental permission before collecting any personal
information from children under 13.
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, however, Ms. Varney believes regulation should be
a last resort, filling the breach if the private sector fails,
especially in Internet markets, which change so quickly,
undermining the effectiveness of traditional regulation. ``I think
we can have a market-driven approach to privacy on the Internet,''
she said. ``And, at least, this experiment with self-regulation is
worth doing. Let's see if the marketplace can do it.''
</P>
<P>
   There are encouraging signs of progress. In early 1998, when the
FTC surveyed 1,400 commercial Web sites, only 14 percent gave users
any notice of how they handled personal information. In early 1999,
a Georgetown University survey of some 360 heavily trafficked Web
sites _ a study requested by the FTC and paid for by the industry _
found that 66 percent gave users some notice of how they handled
personal data.
</P>
<P>
   ``That 66 percent is pretty astonishing from where we were a
year ago,'' Ms. Varney observed. ``From my perspective, that means
that self-regulation is working.''
</P>
<P>
   But privacy advocates point to other numbers as evidence that
self-regulation is failing. They note, for example, that the 1999
Georgetown survey also found that only 10 percent of Web sites
included the four touchstones of what the FTC calls ``fair
information practices'': notifying users of the sites' data
collection practices; giving users a choice of opting out; giving
them access to personal data; and assuring them that their personal
data were secure.
</P>
<P>
   The same four principles also serve as the basis for the Online
Privacy Alliance's voluntary guidelines, but critics say the
principles are too vaguely worded, giving companies too much
leeway. ``And those policies are just window-dressing unless they
are backed up by a credible system of enforcement,'' said Deborah
Hurley, director of Harvard University's Information Infrastructure
Project.

   INTERNET SAVVY HISPANICS ... AN OXYMORON? _ The United States
may be facing an educational disaster in the coming decades.
According to a study by the Department of Education, three out of
four school-age kids lack the writing ability necessary to land
adequate jobs. Hispanic children with limited English-speaking
ability and who reside in economically depressed homes scored the
lowest. Concurrent with these results, however, come the startling
results of a national survey that concludes that
Hispanics-Americans are second only to Asian-Americans in Internet
access. What does this all mean? Columnist Raoul Lowery Contreras
searches for answers.
</P>
<P>
   THE PATH TO ABUSE OF THE FIRST AMENDMENT ISN'T A ONE-WAY STREET.
``Here we go again,'' writes columnist Vernon Jarrett. ``This time
the holier-than-thou sinner is the management of the Brooklyn
Museum of Art, which is willing to publicly trample the feelings of
millions of religious human beings simply because it believes that
all art is sacred.'' This week, Jarrett offers a hard-hitting
commentary on the controversy concerning Chris Ofili's work ``The
Holy Virgin Mary.'' Jarrett's take: ``Don't ask the taxpayers who
are insulted by the art to finance the promotion of (Ofili's)
ideas. And one need not be impressed by New York's mayor, Rudolph
Giuliani, to feel that way.''
</P>
<P>
   NO RESPECT, NO MONEY _ Political campaign financing season has
arrived once again. This year, however, will be different.
Candidates may have a harder time getting donations from
Asian-American supporters. ``Asian-Americans, who have been stung
by the 1996 campaign contribution scandals, will be shutting doors
and taking the phones off the hooks,'' writes columnist Amy Wu.
Many Asian-Americans feel that they were placed under a cloud of
suspicion after two Chinese-Americans were accused of campaign
finance violations. The media and Democratic political opponents
also helped to tarnish the image and reputation of the
Asian-American community.
</P>
<P>
   GAY REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS HAVE THEIR WORK CUT OUT FOR THEM.
Is there really a change in the attitude of GOP presidential
candidates toward gays? On the surface it would seem so, now that
they are on the campaign trail. Rich Tafel, Executive Director of
the Log Cabin Republicans, says George W. Bush has ``laid the
philosophical groundwork for supporting federal nondiscrimination
policies and legislation.'' Columnist Chuck Colbert couldn't
disagree more. GOP presidential hopefuls, Colbert writes, ``fall
very short of fully supporting and wholeheartedly embracing gay
civil rights as shown by their Democratic contenders,'' who favor
passage of a gay civil-rights employment bill, (the Employment
Nondiscrimination Act), hate-crimes legislation, lesbian and gay
adoptions and political appointments.

   INTERNET SAVVY HISPANICS ... AN OXYMORON? _ The United States
may be facing an educational disaster in the coming decades.
According to a study by the Department of Education, three out of
four school-age kids lack the writing ability necessary to land
adequate jobs. Hispanic children with limited English-speaking
ability and who reside in economically depressed homes scored the
lowest. Concurrent with these results, however, come the startling
results of a national survey that concludes that
Hispanics-Americans are second only to Asian-Americans in Internet
access. What does this all mean? Columnist Raoul Lowery Contreras
searches for answers.

<P>
   THE PATH TO ABUSE OF THE FIRST AMENDMENT ISN'T A ONE-WAY STREET.
``Here we go again,'' writes columnist Vernon Jarrett. ``This time
the holier-than-thou sinner is the management of the Brooklyn
Museum of Art, which is willing to publicly trample the feelings of
millions of religious human beings simply because it believes that
all art is sacred.'' This week, Jarrett offers a hard-hitting
commentary on the controversy concerning Chris Ofili's work ``The
Holy Virgin Mary.'' Jarrett's take: ``Don't ask the taxpayers who
are insulted by the art to finance the promotion of (Ofili's)
ideas. And one need not be impressed by New York's mayor, Rudolph
Giuliani, to feel that way.''
</P>
<P>
   NO RESPECT, NO MONEY _ Political campaign financing season has
arrived once again. This year, however, will be different.
Candidates may have a harder time getting donations from
Asian-American supporters. ``Asian-Americans, who have been stung
by the 1996 campaign contribution scandals, will be shutting doors
and taking the phones off the hooks,'' writes columnist Amy Wu.
Many Asian-Americans feel that they were placed under a cloud of
suspicion after two Chinese-Americans were accused of campaign
finance violations. The media and Democratic political opponents
also helped to tarnish the image and reputation of the
Asian-American community.

   GAY REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS HAVE THEIR WORK CUT OUT FOR THEM.
Is there really a change in the attitude of GOP presidential
candidates toward gays? On the surface it would seem so, now that
they are on the campaign trail. Rich Tafel, Executive Director of
the Log Cabin Republicans, says George W. Bush has ``laid the
philosophical groundwork for supporting federal nondiscrimination
policies and legislation.'' Columnist Chuck Colbert couldn't
disagree more. GOP presidential hopefuls, Colbert writes, ``fall
very short of fully supporting and wholeheartedly embracing gay
civil rights as shown by their Democratic contenders,'' who favor
passage of a gay civil-rights employment bill, (the Employment
Nondiscrimination Act), hate-crimes legislation, lesbian and gay
adoptions and political appointments.

ringing in the year 2000 _ in this short, fun feature. First up:

THE GRASS ROOTS OF DEMOCRATIC POLITICS 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN LYNCH  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The other afternoon, the early shift state
workers were gathering at the bus shelter at Washington Avenue and
Lark Street, one of this old city's key intersections, waiting for
a bus to ferry them home.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe a dozen people milled in and around the green metal and
glass structure on the corner. It was a gentle fall day, awash in
sunlight, so the shelter wasn't needed for protection from the
elements, as it will be in January. The shelter just squatted there
on the corner, the size of a one-car garage, erected a few years
ago at a cost of _ get this, now _ $350,000.
</P>
<P>
   That was the breathtaking price for this thing. At the time,
Donna DeMaria, one of Albany's most prominent homeless activists,
was battling to squeeze about 85 cents out of the city government
so she could keep her shelter for helpless winos going. She was so
annoyed at what this structure had cost that she staged a
demonstration at the corner. The left-wing homeless activists were
picketing a bus shelter to complain, of all things, about
government waste. The point is that when government does something
_ just about anything, really _ it always costs more than it would
cost in the real world.
</P>
<P>
   Tsvi and Deborah Gold know all about that.
</P>
<P>
   They're a pleasant young couple. Tsvi (pronounced ``Svee'') just
got out of Albany Law School. He works in the Bronx for a state
legislator. Deborah is a financial planner. They have a little
house on a quiet corner maybe 40 blocks from the bus shelter.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the Golds decorate their lawn with political signs,
generally signs for liberal, independent Democratic candidates
opposed by the city's powerful Democratic organization. Since this
is a city with about a 14-to-1 enrollment advantage for the
Democrats, primary elections are the only elections that count. The
regular Democratic organization takes primaries seriously. The
organization also takes seriously people who oppose the party's
official selections for political office.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, the Democratic Party committeeman in the
neighborhood, who lives a few doors away, told the Golds that they
don't mow their lawn often enough. The committeeman said he mowed
his lawn twice a week. He suggested that they do the same thing.
Otherwise, the city government might give them trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Deborah and Tsvi are busy people. They said thanks for the
advice and kept on mowing twice a month. Not long afterward, they
found on their door a notice from the city ordering them to mow
their lawn. They called the city. An inspector came out. The
inspector said he saw no problem with the yard and left.
</P>
<P>
   Then, a few weeks ago, Deborah and Tsvi took a trip to the
Netherlands. Tsvi's sister was getting married there. When they
came home, they found a notice that the city had mowed their lawn
and was demanding $138.75 for the service. You pay it, or the city
imposes a lien on your house.
</P>
<P>
   This is a tiny lawn _ 30-by-120 feet in the front, 30-by-40 in
the back. A lawn service might charge $40 to mow it. The city had
done a crummy job, too. Big clumps of grass were left. Thirteen
days after the mowing, a tape measure showed those clumps to be
seven inches in height, indicating that the grass hadn't been all
that high when city workers had swooped down on the Gold's lawn.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bruce, Albany's commissioner of general services, would not
say who had complained about the Golds' lawn. Was it the
committeeman, he was asked? Well, Bruce didn't really know, and
didn't want to talk about it. When reached, the committeeman said
it definitely wasn't he who had complained.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce did look into the matter, though. He decided that the city
had made a mistake. So, the commissioner said, Tsvi and Deborah
Gold will receive a letter telling them to forget about the
$138.75. Which, apparently, ends this little adventure in
government economics.
</P>
<P>
   Unless somebody somewhere has the political juice to get a bus
shelter erected on the Golds' corner.

CHRISTIAN `RIGHT' IS WRONG FOR THE REPUBLIC 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MIKE SCOTT  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WALNUT CREEK, Calif. _ Open-minded people understand the
frustration with a meddling ``Christian'' right that led to
Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura's unfortunate quip about religion
being for the ``weak-minded.''
</P>
<P>
   But while the sage from St. Paul dodges jeers, we might give a
two centuries' belated cheer for the Freedom From Religion
Foundation, based in Madison, Wis. The organization, which fights
for the separation of church and state, held its convention in San
Francisco a few months ago. One more time: Our founding fathers
were not ``Christians'' but broad-minded, philosophically
omnivorous theists.
</P>
<P>
   Adams, Madison, Franklin, Jefferson, Washington and others used
``God'' as an all-encompassing, inclusive, even mystical concept
for what might be believed or not yet known. Jefferson and some of
the Virginians may have been Anglicans. But please, enough with
this Bible-appropriating, divisive Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   The historical Jesus was, by all accounts, a wandering
carpenter/philosopher with a sense of humor who enjoyed a debate.
Had he been a contemporary of and met Buddha, Mohammed, et al.,
they'd probably have broken bread together, become friends, even
traveled together awhile.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to believe in the Chevrolet-Pontiac-Buick line of
General Christianity, fine. This is your right as an American. But
it is not _ and never should be _ a requisite of citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   Like any code, philosophy or belief system, Christianity has
been used to justify war, torture, land-grabbing, genocide, bigotry
_ a far cry from the gentle, inclusive invitations of a
big-hearted, visionary, traveling craftsman. A far remove from
polyester-garbed, limo-riding televangelists bilking the life
savings from ill-educated grannies and shut-ins, and the We/They
code speak of political hacks like Jesse Helms, Pat Robertson and
Trent Lott.
</P>
<P>
   As a white North Carolina schoolboy in the early '60s, I had
dinner at the home of a white classmate. We bowed our heads in
prayer. Within minutes, my friend's brother received only the
mildest, chuckling rebuke from his parents after telling an
astoundingly ugly n-word joke.
</P>
<P>
   In the third grade, the only way to escape the weekly Bible
teacher was to produce a note from home, which meant you spent that
time like some lonely leper in the empty school library.
</P>
<P>
   This was a public school. So you'd feign interest as some pious,
heavily rouged harpie recited the usual parables from the
much-revised King James Impala/Galaxie 500 version of the New
Testament. (None of that Old Testament weirdness in good old
Charlotte, N.C.) In the sixth grade, in another public school in a
slightly more upscale neighborhood, presumably to demonstrate a
modern, low-earth-orbit, Mercury-capsule view of our colonial past,
the teacher had each pupil announce a religious affiliation. This
exercise was to make us appreciate our ``religious freedom'' and
diversity as we approached another Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   ``Richard?'' ``Baptist''; ``Charlie?'' ``Methodist''; ``Susan,
Tommy, Kathy?'' ``Baptist, Baptist, Presbyterian''; ``Virginia?``
``Episcopalian'' (this exotic departure seemed fitting since little
Virginia was a hothouse orchid often absent with rheumatic fever);
``Sammy, Bucky, Patricia?'' ``Baptist, Baptist, Lutheran.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike? `` ... uh ...''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike?'' ``Well, uh, my parents play tennis Sunday mornings.''
</P>
<P>
   The blistering silence suggested I'd announced we were
puppy-eatin' Martians. During recess, a couple kids sidled over to
me and admitted my answer was ``cool.'' But I was still a pagan
Yankee.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican Party loves the Christian right. A public
blindsided with the Ten Commandments and prayer in the classroom
won't question who's getting how much from big tobacco, gun
manufacturers, and corporate polluters.
</P>
<P>
   Freedom is an adult concept. Some people can't handle it. But
freedom is the bedrock of our nation, and our nation's defining
tract, the Constitution, which protects, but does not dictate, the
Bible, Cervantes, Mark Twain, rap, performance artists, Strom
Thurmond and the late, great Henny Youngman.
</P>
<P>
   In the texts of all the world's great religions you find the
Golden Rule. The Talmud's version is as elegantly simple as any of
them: ``What is hateful to you, do not to your fellow men. That is
the entire Law; all the rest is commentary.''
</P>
<P>
   If you want to customize that with options at your local dealer,
fine. But no advertising in the classroom.
</P>

   CYBORGS-FASHION (New York) _ Thad Starner, a 29-year-old
assistant professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology,
considers himself one of the first cyborgs _ an acronym for
cybernetic organism, a being that is part machine, part human.
Cyborgs wear their computers almost continuously. They get e-mail
on their eyeglasses while they're talking to you, and now they've
recruited models to try to make the idea of wearing a computer, all
day every day, the new thing. A series of fashion shows at a
computer trade show last week gave a glimpse into what happens when
the worlds of technology and fashion try to converge instead of
collide. By Lisa Guernsey.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Teaching hospitals aren't the only health-related
groups lobbying Congress for relief from the Medicare spending cuts
that the lawmakers and President Clinton imposed two years ago in
the drive for a balanced federal budget.
</P>
<P>
   Also fighting for their share of an expected restoration of
Medicare dollars are nursing homes, home health care agencies,
managed care providers and physical, occupational and speech
therapists.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers and independent analysts, such as the Congressional
Budget Office, acknowledge that some federal health programs were
slashed too deeply when Medicare was cut by $112 billion, a key
element of the 1997 Balanced Budget Act (the BBA.)
</P>
<P>
   This realization is fueling a push for Congress to restore some
of the cuts as the lawmakers write spending bills for the new
fiscal year that began Oct. 1. The new funding is referred to in
Congress as the ``BBA-fix.''
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for the different groups vying for restoration of
Medicare funds have been making their cases in congressional
hearings and in the hallways, armed with industry surveys and
heart-wrenching anecdotes.
</P>
<P>
   Solid data is in short supply.
</P>
<P>
   The agency that runs Medicare, the Health Care Financing
Administration, is still gathering information to measure the
effect of the cuts _ many of which have yet to take hold. Because
the data isn't yet in, some key lawmakers are leaning toward a
short-term fix, such as one that would restore funds over one or
two years.
</P>
<P>
   As this high-stakes lobbying campaign rages, campaign
contributions have flowed from those jostling for a share of
returned Medicare money.
</P>
<P>
   The well-heeled American Health Care Association, which
represents the nation's nursing homes, ponied up $722,580 to House
and Senate candidates in the 1997-98 election cycle, federal
records show. Smaller players, such as the National Association for
Home Care, shelled out $37,000 in that period, federal records
show.
</P>
<P>
   Teaching hospitals boast that they don't even have a political
action committee, preferring to position themselves above the
fund-raising fray.
</P>
<P>
   Financial heavy hitters such as managed care plans also fork
over large donations in soft money, the unlimited contributions
that are supposed to go toward issue advocacy and party building,
as opposed to individual candidates. The nation's 10 largest
managed care plans shelled out $560,250, in 1997-98, according to
Common Cause.
</P>
<P>
   Following are the five main interest groups jockeying for more
Medicare funding:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; OCCUPATIONAL, PHYSICAL AND SPEECH THERAPY &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Medicare pays physical, speech and occupational therapists to
help elderly or disabled people regain muscle strength, walk,
relearn how to swallow or speak, or how to dress or eat, often
after a stroke or an injury.
</P>
<P>
   THE CUTS: The 1997 Balanced Budget Act capped Medicare payments
for speech and physical therapy for each patient at a combined
total of $1,500 a year, and also limited occupational therapy to
$1,500 a year, except at hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Before the cuts, only occupational and physical therapists in
business for themselves had an annual Medicare limit of $900 per
patient. Therapists working at nursing homes, rehabilitation
centers and physician's offices weren't capped.
</P>
<P>
   BACKDROP: Medicare payments to outpatient therapy providers had
been growing 25 to 35 percent a year from 1990 to 1996, according
to the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission.
</P>
<P>
   TOP LOBBYISTS: The three major therapy-related groups, known as
the Tri-Alliance, are represented by:
</P>
<P>
   --Patrick Cooney, 31, a former congressional staffer, is chief
lobbyist for the American Physical Therapy Association, with 70,000
members.
</P>
<P>
   --Jim Potter, 37, a former staffer for the American Medical
Association, is director of government relations for the American
Speech-Language Hearing Association, with 100,000 members.
</P>
<P>
   -- Christina A. Metzler, 47, a 15-year veteran of lobbying on
health issues, represents the American Occupational Therapy
Association, with 60,000 members.
</P>
<P>
   THEIR CASE: Cooney says the cuts are forcing some seniors to
ration their care because they are afraid of busting the limits. He
says the combined cap on physical and speech therapy forces elderly
and disabled people to make a cruel choice: ``They're asking a
patient to either walk or talk.''
</P>
<P>
   Metzler says many patients now get their occupational therapy
from untrained aides because they have exceeded the spending
limits. She also says about 30 percent of occupational therapists
report layoffs or lost jobs since the Medicare cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fewer therapists, means less therapy, means less healing for
the patients,'' Metzler says.
</P>
<P>
   THEIR GOAL: Therapists want no limits on Medicare spending for
the sickest patients.
</P>
<P>
   About one in seven Medicare beneficiaries needing rehabilitation
therapy will exceed the caps this year, according to Stephanie
Maxwell, a senior analyst at Congress's Medicare Payment Advisory
Commission.
</P>
<P>
   CHAMPIONS: Sen. Charles E. Grassley, R-Iowa, chairman of the
Senate Special Committee on Aging, Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., and
Reps. Richard M. Burr, R-N.C., Jim McCrery, R-La., Frank Pallone,
D-N.J., and Ben Cardin, D-Md.
</P>
<P>
   &QC;  &QC;  &QC;  &QC;  &QC;  &QC;  &QC;  &QC;  &QC;  &QC;  &QC;  &QC;  &QC;  &QC;  &QC;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NURSING HOMES &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The 17,000 nursing homes across the nation care for 1.6 million
elderly and disabled people.
</P>
<P>
   THE CUTS: Before the 1997 cuts, Medicare reimbursed nursing
homes for such high intensity services as chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   Now nursing homes get a fixed amount per patient from Medicare
for room, board and medical treatment, which averages about $230 to
$300 a day, depending on a patient's medical condition.
Rehabilitation therapy in nursing homes also was capped at between
$1,500 and $3,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   BACKDROP: While Medicare payments to nursing homes rose 33
percent a year from 1990 to 1997, the number of patients increased
about 10 percent a year, according to the Medicare Patient Advisory
Commission.
</P>
<P>
   TOP LOBBYISTS: Bruce Yarwood, 57, a former nursing home manager,
is the key lobbyist for the American Health Care Association,
representing 12,000 nursing facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Also: Haley Barbour, former chairman of the Republican National
Committee, and Vic Fazio, former veteran Democratic congressman
from Sacramento, are lobbyists for the Alliance for Quality Nursing
Home Care, representing 12 of the nation's largest nursing home
chains.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   THEIR CASE: Yarwood says many nursing homes are cutting out such
services as dialysis, chemotherapy or ventilators because Medicare
doesn't pick up enough of the costs.
</P>
<P>
   The Medicare cuts have hurt the nursing home industry. One of
the nation's largest nursing home chains, Vencor, with about 300
homes in 46 states, filed for bankruptcy protection in September.
Sun Healthcare Group, a national chain with 385 homes, is in
default on its debt, and several regional nursing home chains are
faltering financially.
</P>
<P>
   THEIR GOAL: Nursing home advocates want Medicare to cover costs
for the sickest patients who require the most costly treatments.
They also want an across-the-board increase in Medicare funding.
</P>
<P>
   CHAMPIONS: Sens. Orrin G. Hatch, R-Utah, Pete V. Domenici,
R-N.M., Thomas A. Daschle, D-S.D., and Bob Kerrey, D-Neb.
</P>
<P>
   &QC;  &QC;  &QC;  &QC;  &QC;  &QC;  &QC;  &QC;  &QC;  &QC;  &QC;  &QC;  &QC;  &QC;  &QC;  &QC;  &QC;  &QC;  &QC;  &QC;  &QC;  &QC;  &QC;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MANAGED CARE PLANS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Many managed care plans, such as HMOs, contract with Medicare to
provide health coverage to elderly and disabled people.
</P>
<P>
   THE CUTS: The 1997 Balanced Budget Act lowered Medicare payment
rates to these plans, which receive a fixed payment for each
patient, regardless of the patient's medical needs. To stop HMOs
from preferring relatively healthy patients, the federal government
decided to pay higher rates for sicker patients and lower rates for
healthier ones. The result: HMOs get fewer Medicare dollars.
</P>
<P>
   BACKDROP: At the time of the cuts, CEOs of some managed care
organizations were being paid annual salaries of $5 million to $15
million. Recently, federal auditors have said Medicare was
overpaying managed care providers who contract with Medicare. These
Medicare-managed care plans care for 16 percent of Medicare's 39
million enrollees.
</P>
<P>
   TOP LOBBYIST: Karen M. Ignagni, 45, a veteran staffer of the
A.F.L-C.I.O, was criticized as a turncoat six years ago when she
left the labor organization and went to work as president and chief
lobbyist for the American Association of Health Plans, a trade
association for the managed care industry.
</P>
<P>
   THEIR CASE: Ignagni says managed care plans that serve Medicare
beneficiaries have dropped 720,000 enrollees because the plans
don't find them profitable. She says managed care plans ``have
become the pinata of health care.''
</P>
<P>
   THEIR GOAL: Health plans want Medicare payments to managed care
plans to grow in step with traditional Medicare spending, rather
than the annual 1/2 percent reductions scheduled through 2002.
</P>
<P>
   CHAMPIONS:
</P>
<P>
   Reps. Michael Bilirakis, R-Fla, and Peter Deutsch, D-Fla.
</P>
<P>
   &QC;  &QC;  &QC;  &QC;  &QC;  &QC;  &QC;  &QC;  &QC;  &QC;  &QC;  &QC;  &QC;  &QC;  &QC;  &QC;  &QC;  &QC;  &QC;  &QC;  &QC;  &QC;  &QC;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; HOME HEALTH CARE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Home health care, commonly known as the ``visiting nurse''
program, is the federal Medicare benefit that pays for nurses,
aides and therapists to provide part-time care in the homes of ill
elderly or disabled people.
</P>
<P>
   THE CUTS: Before the 1997 Balanced Budget Act, Medicare didn't
limit the number of home health visits but set the cost of a
nursing visit, for example, at an average of $101. The 1997 cuts
forced that down to an average of $87.
</P>
<P>
   The Medicare cuts also put a lid on the amount that home health
care providers could spend on average for each patient each year.
Annual spending limits generally range from $1,200 to $8,000, based
on what the provider spent on patients in the past.
</P>
<P>
   BACKDROP: When Congress made the cuts, home health care was the
fastest growing part of Medicare, expanding an average of 25
percent a year from 1990 to 1997, according to the Government
Accounting Office. There also had been several scandals involving
home health providers squandering federal funds on such items as
gourmet popcorn, turkeys and luxury cars.
</P>
<P>
   TOP LOBBYIST: Val J. Halamandaris, 56, the son of a Utah Coal
miner, is the president of the National Association of Home Care,
the industry's largest trade association, with about 6,000 members.
Halamandaris was counsel to the Senate Special Committee on Aging
and the House Select Committee on Aging for a total of 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   THEIR CASE: Halamandaris says the 1997 Medicare cuts have
prompted the closing of more than 2,486 or one-quarter of the
nation's home health agencies, which are private businesses or
hospitals that provide home care.
</P>
<P>
   More are expected to fold because they have overspent caps
imposed by Congress and now must repay the federal government. The
closings have left a growing number of rural counties and poor
urban areas without home health care, says Halamandaris.
</P>
<P>
   Many providers are turning away patients who need the most
intensive and chronic care (the most expensive ones), he says.
</P>
<P>
   Since the cuts, the number of people receiving home health care
has fallen from 3.5 million to 3 million, according to estimates by
the association. Many of those who no longer receive home care have
landed in hospitals, nursing homes or are cared for by family
members, the association says.
</P>
<P>
   THEIR GOAL: Home health advocates want Congress to head off an
additional 15 percent cut slated for next Oct. 1 and they want no
limits on reimbursements for taking care of the sickest patients.
</P>
<P>
   CHAMPIONS: Sens. Susan M. Collins, R-Maine, Christopher ``Kit''
Bond, R-Mo., Jim M. Jeffords, R-Vt., and Reps. J.C. Watts, R-Okla.,
and John E. Peterson, R-Pa.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   &UR; TEACHING HOSPITALS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The nation's teaching hospitals receive about $9 billion a year
from Medicare to train medical residents and help cover the higher
cost of their traditionally sicker and poorer patients.
</P>
<P>
   THE CUTS: The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 slashed the Indirect
Medical Education payment, a fee added to each Medicare payment to
subsidize the cost of more intensive treatment for the severely
ill. The fees were cut by 29 percent over five years through 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Disproportionate Share Hospital payments, which go to
institutions that serve unusually large numbers of poor people,
were cut by 5 percent over five years.
</P>
<P>
   The 1997 Balanced Budget Act also capped the number of residents
allowed at teaching hospitals at 1996 levels.
</P>
<P>
   THE BACKDROP: At the time of the cuts, many of the nation
largest teaching hospitals had 28 percent profit margins for
Medicare hospitalized patients. The new Medicare rules and managed
care have shrunk these margins, forcing mergers, staff cutbacks and
the decisions by some universities to sell their money-losing
hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   TOP LOBBYIST: Richard M. Knapp, 58, who has a PhD in hospital
and health administration from the University of Iowa, is the chief
lobbyist for the American Association of Medical Colleges, which
represents 400 major teaching hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   THEIR CASE: Advocates say more than 40 percent of the major
teaching hospitals in this country will be losing money by 2002.
Financial troubles are causing devastating cutbacks in medical
research and jeopardizing the education of the nation's future
doctors, they argue.
</P>
<P>
   THEIR GOAL: Teaching hospitals want to eliminate any further
cuts to the Indirect Medical Education and to the Disproportionate
Share Hospital payments.
</P>
<P>
   CHAMPIONS: Sens. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., Edward M.
Kennedy, D-Mass., Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., and Rep. Charles
Rangel, D-N.Y., the top Democrat on the key House Ways and Means
panel.

COPS, KIDS FIND COMMON TURF 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM WONG  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ In this city, when you see clusters of cops,
their car lights flashing, you usually say, ``Uh, oh. What's
wrong?''
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Jerry Brown's superstardom notwithstanding, Oakland's
reputation remains that of a crime-ridden city where police actions
are commonplace.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, last week, as the early autumn sun started to set, all
those cops and their cars surrounding a seven-story downtown garage
were part of a unique street-theater piece designed to close some
of the communications gap between local law enforcement and
teen-agers. Kids and cops are usually an oil-and-water combination.
In recent years, however, some artists, community activists and
police leaders have worked to concoct a smoother blend of those
normally unmixable ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   Their work culminated in the performance art piece known as Code
33, cop lingo for ``emergency _ clear the air.''
</P>
<P>
   And that is what Code 33 tried to do. Police cars and low-riders
were scheduled to enter the garage in a procession to start the
event. But several hundred supporters of Mumia Abu-Jamal, a
convicted cop killer sentenced to death in Pennsylvania,
interrupted the proceedings. Their noisy march caused Code 33
organizers to cancel the procession. The conversations between cops
and kids on the garage rooftop went on, however. In circles of
eight or 10, police officers and teen-agers of different racial
backgrounds went at it verbally for about 90 minutes, as hundreds
of ordinary Oaklanders and city officials eavesdropped. The talk
was often direct and honest.
</P>
<P>
   Cop: ``What has a bad cop done to you personally?''
</P>
<P>
   Kid: ``I got sprayed with Mace, pushed around and handcuffed. I
felt really disrespected.''
</P>
<P>
   Kid: ``Everybody stereotypes everybody else. That's why we feel
the way we feel and you feel the way you feel.''
</P>
<P>
   Kid: ``We're talking about power, and you're the ones with
power.''
</P>
<P>
   Kid: ``The police should establish friendships with kids and the
community, to build trust, so kids will stay out of trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Cop: ``That's right. The most rewarding moment for me is when a
bunch of kids run up to me and call me by my name.''
</P>
<P>
   Cop: ``Some parents will call us to control their kids. We
become the bad guys. That's why people have negative attitudes
toward us.''
</P>
<P>
   Kid: ``My mom and I were passing out fliers for my mom's
business in the hills. Lots of Caucasian people live there. A
police car drove by. He kept looking at us. He drove away, then he
came back. That was not called for. Finally, he said my mom's car
lights were messed up.''
</P>
<P>
   Cop: ``What I would have done is wave and ask how you're doing
and drive away. We're not going to nitpick you. There are so many
other things we need to do. I wouldn't harass you or your mom,
unless we see something out of the ordinary. Some police officers
may be racists or prejudiced. We try to correct those feelings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Police officers are also people. Most police officers have
experiences that most people don't have. That officer may have been
prejudiced or he may have noticed something you didn't see.''
</P>
<P>
   Kid: ``I was thrown on the hood of a police car. It was hot. I
didn't do anything. The cops didn't apologize, or nothing. I don't
trust police.''
</P>
<P>
   Talk is cheap. We know that even the most innovative methods of
getting a relatively small number of cops and kids to spend a few
hours talking honestly with one another in a non-threatening
situation aren't going to wipe out deep feelings of distrust
between members of the two groups. But an event like Code 33 is a
lot better than the usual interactions between cops and kids in
Oakland.

<P>
   MANITOU SPRINGS, Colo. _ What does it take to transform a
19th-century landmark into a 21st-century wonder? Just a guy with a
dream _ plus about two years and $9 million to make it come true.
</P>
<P>
   And while Teddy Roosevelt, Thomas Edison and Jenny Lind would no
doubt be pleased to see the old place restored to its former glory,
Bill Gates and Michael Dell would surely approve as well. That's
because the Cliff House's developer saw the potential for both a
vacationer's dream and a businessman's office on the road and made
the hotel a blend of Victorian beauty and style and 21st-century
amenities and technology.
</P>
<P>
   The Cliff House at Pikes Peak reopened July 15 to great fanfare
in the quaint town of Manitou Springs, nestled against the Rocky
Mountains near Colorado Springs. With the theme ``Luxury Becomes a
Landmark,'' the hotel hopes to attract the same clientele that
frequents the Broadmoor in Colorado Springs _ although far fewer of
them, since the Cliff House has 57 rooms to the Broadmoor's 700.
</P>
<P>
   But that's the draw, said Jeanine Piper, who provided a tour of
the Cliff House. The staff-to-guest ratio is about 40 to 100, and
guests should be able to find everything they need right on the
property. The 4 1/2-story building, which has been welcoming guests
longer than Colorado has been a state, was originally opened in
1873 as The Inn, a stagecoach stop on the route from Colorado
Springs to Leadville, and that provenance earned it a spot on the
National Register of Historic Places in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   When the gold strikes in the region began to play out, Manitou
Springs turned to another attraction: the old mineral springs
bubbling up from limestone aquifers. Edward E. Nichols, who had
come from the East seeking a cure for his tuberculosis, stayed on
in Manitou Springs as an eight-term mayor. In 1876, seeing dollar
signs in the springs, Nichols converted the inn into a luxury
resort hotel. The healing powers of the springs were touted for the
restoration of good health, and for 70 years the hotel thrived as a
prime destination for the wealthy.
</P>
<P>
   The Manitou Bath House Co. across the way, with its Soda
Springs, provided healing baths and sparkling water for guests.
</P>
<P>
   After operating for some years as an apartment house, the Cliff
House was bought by California real estate developer James Morley
in 1981, who converted it to a 42-unit apartment building with the
long-term dream of obtaining financing to transform it into a
luxury hotel.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1982, the dream became a nightmare when a fire destroyed
much of the building. The fire was blamed on a careless smoker and
the low flash point of shredded newspapers that had been used as
insulation. The burned-out shell was boarded up for 16 years while
Morley fought a depressed economy.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, construction began in earnest. The estimated $3.2
million needed for the job became $9 million, and the original plan
for a bed-and-breakfast inn was scrapped for that of a
51,000-square-foot ``boutique hotel'' with Victorian architecture
and furnishings. The original architectural detail that made the
building so striking has been restored, from ornate railings and
balustrades to hand-carved moldings and wooden filigree accents
above doors and windows.
</P>
<P>
   Guest suites ranging in price from $129 to $298 include 19
studio rooms, nine junior suites, 12 deluxe rooms and 17 celebrity
suites named after well-known figures who stayed at the hotel
during its earlier life: Henry Ford, Jenny Lind, P.T. Barnum, Clark
Gable, Teddy Roosevelt, Gen. John Pershing and Katharine Lee Bates
(author of ``America the Beautiful'').
</P>
<P>
   You might want to settle into the $5,000 cashmere mattress
donated by the Simmons Mattress Co. for the Zalmon Simmons room,
named for the company's founder. One junior suite has a turret room
with overhead paneling crafted from more than 1,800 pieces of wood.
All are distinctive and lavishly appointed, even the smaller
studios.
</P>
<P>
   A pleasing range of colors has been used for the rooms. While a
bit some of the furniture is antique, most are reproductions. ``We
tried to use local vendors for as much as we could,'' Piper said.
</P>
<P>
   Amenities include two-person spa tubs or steam showers,
310-count Egyptian cotton bed linens and towels, music systems,
lighted makeup mirrors, Turtleware robes, hair dryers,
Caswell-Massey soaps and lotions and, of course, heated toilet
seats and towel warmers _ little touches that can be pretty
important on a Colorado winter night.
</P>
<P>
   Televisions are hidden behind original works of art created for
the hotel by local artisans; open the artful cabinet, and Jay
Leno's looking out. In another thoughtful touch, rooms with
fireplaces have timers built into the bed headboard _ wouldn't want
to get the tootsies cold when it's time to turn off the gas logs
and sleep.
</P>
<P>
   On the technology front, business travelers who use computers on
the road will be delighted to find in-room two-line phones, digital
T-1 capability, Internet and local area network access with
high-speed data cabling and data ports throughout the property. The
hotel, ideally suited for meetings and conferences, offers package
rates for small groups.
</P>
<P>
   In the main floor music room, guests will gather before the
largest of three original fireplaces in the hotel, crafted by
regionally famous Van Briggle Pottery. Gas-burning facsimiles are
in most of the rooms. The grand piano is grand indeed, but it's
equipped with a CD-ROM drive to ensure a constant supply of
flawless accompaniment to the oh-so-Victorian afternoon tea, as
well as meetings and receptions to be held in the room.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks before the grand opening, the adjacent Manitou
Ballroom, designed to hold up to 200 people, had already been
booked for countless special events, including 17 wedding
receptions through December. Innkeeper and co-owner Craig Hartman,
fresh from a seven-year stint at the award-winning Clifton Country
Inn in Charlottesville, Va., is also executive chef at the Cliff
House.
</P>
<P>
   In the Cliff House Restaurant, a solariumlike room where
$180,000 in Pella windows offers diners views of the nearby peaks,
fixed price, a la carte and spa cuisine menus are served. Hartman's
emphasis is on local and regional ingredients and selections from
the 7,500-bottle wine cellar, built behind the 126-year-old safe
door that hasn't budged since its installation. Also included in
the rates are a complimentary shuttle from the Colorado Springs
Airport, complimentary valet parking, a fitness room and on-call
masseuse.
</P>
<P>
   Not many hotels have a historian serving as the concierge and
gift shop operator. But Betty Jo Cardona has been following the
hotel's history for many years and snapped up the job there. ``I'm
delighted to see how it has turned out, so it was a natural for me
to work here and keep tracking it,'' she said.

NEW COP SHOW STEPS BEYOND TRITE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TIM GOODMAN  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Conventional wisdom says the television cop
genre is dead. After all, what show is going to top the gallows
humor and intelligence of ``Homicide: Life on the Street,'' and how
do you create a better character than Dennis Franz's Sipowicz on
``NYPD Blue''?
</P>
<P>
   Yet cynics who said no one would improve on the groundbreaking
``Hill Street Blues'' also were _ well, sort of _ proven wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of launching a bunch of new cop shows, recent trends
have taken to mixing them with firefighters and paramedics or, more
successfully, with lawyers. Writers drifted away from uniformed
cops after several attempts failed miserably. So lawyers bloomed
and doctors came to life in the minds of those people responsible
for keeping us entertained. Nobody wanted to mess with ``NYPD
Blue.''
</P>
<P>
   But Fox, which either loves to go against the grain or just
doesn't have much common sense, is launching a new police show
called ``Ryan Caulfield: Year One'' (8 p.m. Eastern, Friday). Given
the current state of Fox's new fall shows, perhaps a better title
might have been, ``Ryan Caulfield: Week One.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, this show has changed titles regularly. It started as
``Ryan Caulfield.'' Then it was switched to ``The Badland'' _
singular _ because it's about a rookie cop in Philadelphia's
Badlands _ plural. At the last minute, Fox gave it the current
hopeful title.
</P>
<P>
   The network may be on to something. This show is no ``NYPD
Blue,'' it's no ``Homicide.'' But that's the point, is it not? To
revive a dead genre, you have to be a little different.
</P>
<P>
   The premise is that Ryan (Sean Maher) is a 19-year-old kid who
forgoes the college experience to become a rookie cop in Philly.
His friends don't get it. After all, when things get ugly at a frat
house party, he pulls his badge. There's a word for someone who
pulls that kind of move: narc.
</P>
<P>
   Yet that is the kind of conflict the producers are adept at
tapping in the pilot. This guy should be doing Jell-O shots and
skipping classes. Instead, on his first day at work, he rolls up on
a crime scene where six people are dead, including an undercover
cop.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ryan Caulfield: Year One'' uses a lot of voice-overs from
Maher. Although that conceit usually grows tiring, it works for
this series because it is essential to know what is going on in the
mind of a guy who is getting one serious life lesson and growing up
faster than he had ever thought.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the people responsible for ``The Negotiator'' are behind
this series, and that keeps it from becoming a really bad Fox
attempt to make a cop show and, more importantly, just the usual
blues-on-a-beat formula.
</P>
<P>
   What helps this show immensely is the wonderful acting by
Michael Rispoli as Caulfield's veteran partner. Yeah, he has to
spout some of the jaded cop cliches we know all too well from
tough-partner-rookie-cop scenarios, but Rispoli makes it work, and
his character has some new wrinkles that flesh out the familiarity.
</P>
<P>
   Also helping is Roselyn Sanchez (expect to see her in magazines
and getting a lot of ink) as Caulfield's potential love interest.
She's a cop, too. And, yes, some stereotypes can't be replaced _
she's a babe.
</P>
<P>
   Where ``Ryan Caulfield: Year One'' really takes a different turn
is that the show also focuses on his life after work. His friends _
a convenience-store-working, pop-culture-spewing porn lover (James
Roday) and a lovable dim bulb (Chad Lindberg) _ give the character
a refreshingly grounded outlook. You understand that, hey, he's
only 19.
</P>
<P>
   Although ``Ryan Caulfield: Year One'' probably won't stretch the
genre, it did find a new path on which to build stories. The pilot
is solid and, at times, riveting. You can build a relationship with
the characters. Maher is believable as a coming-of-age cop and,
frankly, it's good to see cops back in business because all those
lawyers are getting tiresome.

 &HT;    Stone a mature voice in bubble gum village
 &HT;    By Miriam Longino
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just when it looked like he was perilously close to heading the
bus to Branson, last refuge for fading country stars, middle-aged
Doug Stone comes up with an album that puts him back in action as a
player on the youth-obsessed country scene. The 43-year-old
Georgian still delivers the same menthol-smooth sound that sent him
to the top of the charts in the early '90s with sweet songs about
people who punch time clocks and live in tract houses. After a
period of commercial doldrums (and some wobbly live performances),
Stone is still paying Hallmark card homage to the simple man who
rolls his cigarettes up in his T-shirt sleeve. This time, however,
he's picked an engaging set of tunes that complements his country
crooner voice, midlife perspective and working class point of view.
Stone's Southern-drenched accent is perfect on lyrics such as
``Blue bird sangin' on a redbud buddin''' (``One Saturday''), or
the gushingly sentimental ``the beauty I see can't be bought off a
rack'' (``Deeper Than That''). An album highlight is the trio of
``Dear John'' songs that captures the unbearable pain of being
jilted _ ``Not Me,'' ``A Room Without a View,'' and the duet with
Leslie Satcher, ``The Heart Holds On.'' In quite a contrast to the
bubble gum stuck all over country charts, Stone is the world-weary
guy at the bar wondering, ``What happened?'' So are a lot of
country music fans, who will welcome Stone back on this CD with a
raised glass and a toast.

 &HT;    Indigos diversify but keep folkie soul
 &HT;    By Steve Dollar
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bathed in the nervous light of MTV and teased by the perverse
transience of instant stardom, the contemporary music consumer
can't count on much. The pop charts often appear to be the
diabolical work of a top-secret cloning lab, where Backstreet Boys
can be endlessly minted and no one remembers what songs sounded
like without samples.
</P>
<P>
   It's in this atmosphere that Atlanta's Indigo Girls seem almost
radical. Not because of their politics. Expressed in song, these
can be cloying even when you agree with every fundamentally human
right they passionately espouse. But, simply, because vocalists and
songwriters Amy Ray and Emily Saliers do whatever they want, and do
it by insisting on an enlightened Southern consciousness that is
never at odds with the everlasting urge to rowdy on down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come on Now Social,'' the duo's seventh studio album, picks up
where 1997's career-high ``Shaming of the Sun'' left off: with a
sonic surprise. The album's opener, ``Go,'' adds an urgent layer of
Clash-style combat rock to the Indigos' always strong harmonies.
Elsewhere across the CD's dozen tracks, an all-star studio band
(everyone from Joan Osborne to the Band's Garth Hudson drops by)
continually complicates the songs, which bounce between mellow
romantic reveries (Saliers' ``Peace Tonight'' and ``We Are
Together'') and more pointedly social concerns (Ray's
no-go-death-row ballad for ``Faye Tucker,'' which echoes the
like-minded country protest of Steve Earle). When the music really
swings, it's because the Indigos have struck a perfect balance
between the banjo and the beatbox. The album's highlights, Saliers'
``Trouble'' and Ray's ``Ozilline,'' do just that, grounding belief
in daily experience, finding the weight of the world in a handful
of red clay.

   Detroit could learn a lesson or two from 311. The workmanlike
Nebraska combo has taken a cue from Henry Ford, applied it to riffs
lifted from the Red Hot Chili Peppers and produced a new musical
model: assembly-line funk. Every note on the group's fifth studio
album hums with precision tune _ it's a mild motor-booty affair for
the SUV set. Cruising on a road-tested ska/hip-hop/light metal
groove, ``Soundsystem'' runs smoother than the band's self-titled
1995 breakthrough and has more engine power than the pokey 1997 dud
``Transistor.'' With all the emotion of a voice warning system
(``lights ... are ... on''), lead singer Nick Hexum delivers an
options list of be-yourself bromides such as ``Do what you feel,
the more absurd the better,'' from the fuel-efficient rocker
``Strong All Along.'' All in all, a dependable ride, though there's
little soul in this machine.

   Equally influenced by members Ben Watt's recent stints as a
late-night club DJ and Tracey Thorn's increasing passion for house
music, this British pop duo's ninth album may be the club album of
the year. While other pop stars have tinkered with drum 'n' bass
and house dance mixes, turning them into exercises of triviality
(Cher, for example, springs to mind), ETBTG raises the bar on the
genre by trading on its 15-year pop career as intelligent,
insightful chroniclers of the human condition. The act's best
weapon, Thorn's incomparably smoky alto, never gets buried in the
beats and lends a rich human warmth to a musical genre usually
dismissed by mainstream pop fans as cold and computerized. For that
reason in nightclubs, tracks such as ``Five Fathoms'' and ``The
Future of Future'' (a collaboration with Deep Dish) easily slice
through the smoke and din to caress and affect listeners. Uniquely,
the haunting intimacies of the sometimes lovelorn-heavy lyrics
enable ``Temperamental'' to be just as effective in your car stereo
system.

<P>
   Though its music is Atlanta-specific and proud of it, one big
thing new rap duo Youngbloodz has going for it is the universally
loved hook. And mostly, only, the hook. If you're not familiar with
certain parts of this city, you may not understand how ``Everybody
say ...'' becomes the slang ``Now how we do it when we do it shorty
... .'' But when the hook (and the title) follows _ ``U-Way!'' _
you not only comprehend but want to yell along. Same goes for
Sean-Paul and J-Bo's ``Shakem' Off,'' another kinetic party chant
with an eerie hollow gurgle underneath. Similarly imaginative
production on ``Down Heya (In the South)'' and ``Pop, Pop, Pop''
help pass the time between yet another verse about going to the
Gentlemen's Club or a girl's house (certain hit single ``85''). But
there are way too few songs with something more than ``U-Way'' to
say.

 &HT;    There's a lot to love about `10 Things I Hate'
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``10 Things I Hate About You''
</P>
<P>
   (PG-13)
</P>
<P>
   Maybe I'm wrong, but I think you can search all 37 of
Shakespeare's plays and not find a scene with a guy drawing male
genitals on another guy's face. That's one of the early clues that
this is a very loose version of ``The Taming of the Shrew.''
</P>
<P>
   The opening minutes cram in plenty of sex jokes, including a
porn novel the school counselor is secretly writing, which gives
characters a chance to say ``engorged,'' ``bratwurst'' and other
snicker-trigger words for its targeted teen crowd. But after a
terrible beginning, the movie starts to percolate with wit and
charm, thanks largely to its Kate-and-Petruchio stand-ins, Kat
(Julia Stiles) and Patrick (Heath Ledger). She's the elder of the
Stratford sisters (groan), one of those ``question authority''
girls who reads ``The Bell Jar'' and dismisses Ernest Hemingway as
an ``abusive alcoholic misogynist.'' No wonder she's unpopular,
while her kid sis, Bianca (Larisa Oleynik), is being cruised by
teen lothario Joey (Andrew Keegan).
</P>
<P>
   Problem is, their overprotective single dad (Larry Miller) won't
let Bianca date until her sister does. But when newcomer Cameron
(Joseph Gordon-Levitt) falls for Bianca, he schemes with pal
Michael (David Krumholtz) to arrange a date for Kat. Their man for
the job: Patrick, a longhaired transfer student shadowed by rumors
of a reckless past.
</P>
<P>
   Paid for the job, Patrick starts to woo Kat. You know what
happens next, especially if you've seen ``She's All That'': our
heroine's transformation, her trip to the prom and then the crisis
when she learns her new beau's actions have ulterior motives.
</P>
<P>
   The difference here is that Stiles and Ledger are captivating.
She nails her feminazi shtick, but just as easily melts into
giggles or pulls off a slapstick drunk scene. He's equally
comfortable playing a dangerous loner or doing a goofy song and
dance to impress her. Grade: B

<P>
   &QR;  ``SLC Punk'' (R) _ This energetic, amusing but scattered film
introduces us to Stevo's (Matthew Lillard) world of beer blasts,
punk bands, acid trips and run-ins with the rednecks of Salt Lake
City, circa 1985. A picaresque romp, it wants to be a
``Trainspotting''-lite, an Americanized howl against conformity
that winds up, well, conforming. Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Goodbye Lover'' (R) _ A good film noir _ even a
tongue-in-cheek one, like this wants to be _ has to ground its
hairpin plot with real people. No such luck here. The folks in this
movie, about a sex-death-and-insurance scam, are as slickly remote
as the lavish set decor and cinematography. Grade: C
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Inheritors'' (unrated) _ When a farmer wills his
property to his farmhands, ownership sparks newfound pride in the
peasants. But it also rouses fury from established farmers in this
engaging but uneven Austrian film. In German with English
subtitles. Grade: B-
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Chambermaid on the Titanic'' (unrated) _ The lives of a
French laborer (Olivier Martinez) and his wife (Romane Bohringer)
change forever after his encounter with a chambermaid about to
embark on the Titanic. It's a beguiling meditation on desire, loss
and, especially, the transformative power of art in the drab,
everyday world. Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Rage: Carrie 2'' (R) _ Emily Bergl plays a
misunderstood, telekinetic teen in this cheap, dull horror flick.
The sort-of sequel is so bad, you might mistake it for self-parody.
Amy Irving also stars as the first film's survivor, but skulks
through her scenes looking like she's ready to kill her agent.
(Also available on DVD, with alternate ending, deleted scenes and
audio commentary by director Katt Shea, $24.98.) Grade: D

 &HT;    A casserole that's worth the mess
 &HT;    By Marcia Langhenry
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Robin Flanagan of Jonesboro (Ga.) said she was
desperate.
</P>
<P>
   ``You published a terrific recipe ... a Chicken Enchilada
Casserole using at least two cans of Campbell's soup,'' she wrote,
hoping we could find it in the files.
</P>
<P>
   The recipe was published in 1994 with a story about Steve
Sheppard of Snellville, who said he made it only on special
occasions because it can be messy.
</P>
<P>
   A little mess won't deter Flanagan, though, who said she made it
for her family and they liked it so much that she made another one
the next day for a ladies' brunch. Then she lost the recipe.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's a kitchen without a little mess?'' she replied when we
asked her about it. ``I didn't find this recipe to be any messier
than anything else I have ever cooked. Besides, the compliments
were well worth the time put forth.''
</P>
<P>
   Such glowing praise makes us think other readers might like to
risk a little extra cleanup.

   Cooking time: 1 hour, 10 minutes
</P>
<P>
   20 8-inch flour tortillas

   3 8-ounce packages grated cheese (1 Monterey Jack, 1 sharp
cheddar, 1 mild cheddar)
</P>
<P>
   2 cans (10 3/4 ounces each) cream of chicken soup
</P>
<P>
   1 can (10 3/4 ounces) cream of mushroom soup
</P>
<P>
   2 (16 ounces each) jars taco sauce (1 mild, 1 medium)
</P>
<P>
   1 (10-ounce) can diced tomatoes and green chiles
</P>
<P>
   3 (4.5 ounces each) cans peeled and chopped green chiles
</P>
<P>
   1 quart sour cream, divided
</P>
<P>
   4 fresh tomatoes, chopped
</P>
<P>
   1 head of lettuce, shredded
</P>
<P>
   1 (16-ounce) jar taco sauce for serving (mild, medium or hot)
</P>
<P>
   1 large bag tortilla chips
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   In a large frying pan, heat oil over medium heat. Fry each
tortilla for 5 to 8 seconds per side. Remove to a plate and
separate each tortilla with a paper towel.
</P>
<P>
   Have ready 4 mixing bowls. In the first, combine all grated
cheeses. In the second, mix the soups. In the third, mix the two
jars of taco sauce. In the fourth, mix the tomatoes and chiles.
</P>
<P>
   On a large working surface, place 1 tortilla. Along the center
line of the tortilla, place 2 tablespoons of grated cheese, 1
tablespoon soup, 1 tablespoon taco sauce and 1 tablespoon of the
tomato-chiles mixture. Roll up tortilla and place at the end of a
13 1/4-by-9 1/2-by-2 3/4-inch lasagna baking pan. Continue to roll
up the tortillas and place them in the pan, packing tightly,
forming two rows of 10. When all the tortillas are rolled, pour any
remaining soup, chiles, taco sauce and cheese over them. Bake 1
hour or until bubbly. Spread 2 cups sour cream over casserole and
return to oven for another 10 minutes. Let cool 20 minutes. Slice
and serve in squares as you would lasagna. Serve with bowls of the
remaining sour cream, chopped tomatoes, shredded lettuce, taco
sauce and chips.

<P>
   Like a virus, the NATO bug is spreading.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the spring, we were treated to ``precision'' bombing
of ``military targets'' and to ``collateral damage,'' whose victims
were ``tragic,'' as the alliance bombarded bridges, roadways and
power stations in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Then, within weeks, Israel caught the contagion. It bombed
bridges and roadways in Lebanon and destroyed two electricity
stations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Precision'' bombing, it said, ``military'' targets because the
Lebanese would not stop ``terrorists'' attacking Israel's
occupation troops in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   The ``collateral damage'' (11 dead, including three firemen and
a young couple driving south of Beirut) was to be regretted.
</P>
<P>
   In Iraq _ where the Anglo-American war has been going on since
December _ the air bombardments have increased. Low-level press
briefings regularly announce ``precision'' strikes against military
targets in ``response'' to Iraqi challenges of the no-fly zone.
</P>
<P>
   No matter that the ``response'' often comes two days later,
against targets miles away from the antiaircraft battery that may
have fired at American planes.
</P>
<P>
   No matter that some 127 Iraqi civilians have now been killed in
these raids.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the U.S. Air Force called them ``collateral damage.''
</P>
<P>
   And now it's the Russians who are NATO's copycats, bombing
Chechnya with ``precision,'' seeking only ``military targets'' and
``the total elimination of terrorist bases'' _ the same hopeless
aim of Israel's regular onslaughts against Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, the war is going wrong. Russians are dying,
civilians are dying, apparently by the hundreds. There is some
``collateral damage,'' the Russians now admit. A ``tragedy,'' said
a Russian minister.
</P>
<P>
   Why, there's even a charred bus _ its Chechen passengers blasted
to bits by a Russian tank shell _ to parallel that other, awful bus
on the bridge at Luzane in Kosovo, its Serb and Albanian passengers
incinerated by a cruise missile.
</P>
<P>
   There are action-replays of Russian gun footage for the benefit
of television viewers. Only now are reporters getting into Chechnya
to see the truth.
</P>
<P>
   And, be sure, it's only a matter of time before Russian defense
ministry officials are abusing those journalists the same way
NATO's flacks attacked those reporters who revealed NATO's bloody
ineptitude in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   How can you blame the Israelis for ``defending'' themselves in
Lebanon, an Israeli journalist asked after his country's strike
against power stations and roadway bridges _ which followed the
Israeli wounding of a Lebanese civilian and a subsequent Hezbollah
rocket attack across the Lebanese border. ``After all, look what
NATO did.'' Quite so.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's population is as outraged at the bombings of civilian
apartment blocks in Moscow as NATO countries were at the Serb
atrocities against Kosovo Albanians. But just as NATO's bombing
campaign provoked the worst Serb atrocities _ and a humanitarian
disaster _ so Russia is now provoking a humanitarian catastrophe in
its crusade against ``Islamic terror.''
</P>
<P>
   Islamic terror. The words are carefully chosen, for what
American would object to a war against ``Islamic terror?'' What
Israeli would object to such a campaign?
</P>
<P>
   It all seems so familiar. Since NATO/Israel/Russia/the
Anglo-American air force in the Gulf never _ ever _ intend to kill
civilians, their deaths are always to be blamed upon Milosevic/the
Hezbollah/``Islamic'' rebels or Saddam.
</P>
<P>
   When you're in the air force, it's good to have clean hands. &QL;

 By IMRE KARACS  
 c.1999 The Independent, London  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The voice at the other end of the line sounds cautious. Madame
Durell gets all sorts of crank calls, from people shopping around
for false breasts or lingerie in men's sizes, or from voyeurs like
me.
</P>
<P>
   Some desperate souls will stop at nothing to take a peek inside
Madame Durell's decadent villa in Spandau.
</P>
<P>
   Credentials established, I ring the bell at the gate of the
International School of Travesty. An alsatian growls menacingly,
the front door opens, and Madame Durell stands on the threshold. He
squeezes my hand firmly.
</P>
<P>
   The place looks like the high-class brothel it is rumored to be
in the neighborhood: tasteful antique furniture at ground level and
an all-marble interior straight out of Pompeii down below. At the
far end of the pool in the basement stands a mini-jungle of plastic
palm trees, backing on to one of the establishment's many walls of
mirrors.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors will spend hours ogling their reflections, watching
their shapes, movements and mannerisms slowly transcend the
boundary of gender.
</P>
<P>
   It takes four months to turn a willing male into a passable
female, at least in outward appearance. Four months and Dm35,000
(nearly $20,000). That's how much the course in travesty costs, at
the end of which successful students receive a state-recognized
diploma from Madame Durell, a chartered travesty pedagogue.
</P>
<P>
   This is, after all, a serious educational establishment. On
Berlin's bustling variety scene, travesty is regarded as one of the
highest forms of art, and Madame Durell, who goes by the name of
Sascha Nowak-Tarnawa in his passport, as one of its greatest
exponents.
</P>
<P>
   Berlin, he says, boasts more registered travesty artists _ some
620 _ than any other city in the world. And while New York has its
transvestite school and Amsterdam a school for transsexuals, his is
the only establishment in the world dedicated to the noble art of
cross-dressing.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone understands the school's true mission. ``We have
women aged between 50 and 65 who want to learn striptease for the
benefit of their husbands,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Nowak-Tarnawa is the old-fashioned type. He does not believe
in ``using the human body _ male or female _ for entertainment,
unless it's in the cultural context.''
</P>
<P>
   And his standards are rigorous: only art of the most sublime is
to be pursued on his premises. ``We have an entrance exam. When we
find out that the applicant is just a drag queen, he has to go,''
says Mr. Nowak-Tarnawa.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, he admits the school gets all sorts. One of the
star pupils is a 74-year-old blind psychoanalyst _ happily married
_ who is here to find out what makes women click. He is only doing
the dance part of the course.
</P>
<P>
   Torsten, a 27-year-old waiter, is signed up for the full Monty.
He is unsure whether dressing up as a woman is his real calling,
but he loves playing roles, especially the role of women. Today is
Torsten's first day at Madame Durell's school. He is excited, and a
little nervous.
</P>
<P>
   We take the elevator up to Madame Durell's boudoir: yet more
marble, gilded taps, exquisite robes hanging in the wardrobe, among
them an embroidered folk costume from Mr. Nowak-Tarnawa's native
Poland.
</P>
<P>
   Torsten's first lesson is makeup. He picks out the longest false
eyelashes, applies the foundation with care, but is a little
overexuberant with the lipstick. An hour passes, and Torsten is
still not ready.
</P>
<P>
   We chat as he applies the brush strokes and plucks his eyebrows.
He worked on a cruise liner for two years, scraping the pennies
together for the course.
</P>
<P>
   He would not say it was his life's ambition to go around dressed
in women's clothes, and nor was the family terribly excited about
his further education. ``My mother was taken aback at first, but
now she is more relaxed and says: `If that's what makes you happy,
go ahead.'''
</P>
<P>
   His friends think it is a great idea. ``But I know there is a
lot of work ahead of me.'' More, maybe, than he had reckoned with.
From the makeup room, Torsten goes to the room next to the swimming
pool for a singing lesson.
</P>
<P>
   Standing ramrod straight, feet spread out next to the keyboard
in his black ballet shoes, black trousers with a white line running
down the sides and black sweater, he resembles an overgrown
penguin. Not to worry _ the posture lesson comes later.
</P>
<P>
   Julia, the Polish singing teacher, strikes a few keys. Torsten
has to sing the notes, and he does it well. He has a beautiful
baritone voice, but, alas, cannot rise to the high Cs.
</P>
<P>
   The acting class goes better. Priscilla, an actress from
California who plans to stage deaf cabaret next year in Devon,
England, devises a series of situations for her new student.
</P>
<P>
   ``You come through the door, you are a hero,'' she instructs.
Torsten enters, strutting unconvincingly. ``Let's try something
else,'' she says. ``You will now play a queen.'' Torsten obliges,
delicately guiding the imaginary crinoline through the gap of the
door, and this time the illusion works.
</P>
<P>
   Then it's on to the dance floor, with another American teacher,
Donna, in attendance. First Torsten is a chorus girl, wriggling his
hips to the theme song from ``Cabaret.'' You can tell he has done
this sort of thing before. ``He's doing well,'' whispers Priscilla.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is some Mozart, with Torsten, a head taller than his
teacher, led around the floor. It will take a while before he
masters this, but if he turns out to be good, he will get a chance
to dance Flamenco in high heels.
</P>
<P>
   Torsten has worked hard on his first day, and as a reward is
allowed to wear Madame Durell's silk dress.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to tell four months before graduation, but he looks
promising. ``We still have to work on the style,'' says Mr.
Nowak-Tarnawa. ``But when you know who you are, it will all fall
into place.'' &QL;

 JOHANNESBURG: ... heart problems.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   And so, here they are, seated together, mother and son, Lettie
and Colin, in a huge open room at the Johannesburg Hospital. Before
day's end, about 500 other AIDS sufferers will come and go.
Sometimes you stand in line and the clinic closes, at 4 o'clock.
There is nothing to do but come back another day.
</P>
<P>
   But Colin, who needs a pair of stainless steel crutches to help
drive his weak legs, is lucky. After several hours, he sees his
doctor. He gets some more antibiotics. His T-cell count is 174. Any
count under 200 is considered dangerously low. Afterwards, Colin
hobbles upstairs to the 7th floor of the hospital and enters a room
where he is given food in a bag to carry home. He leaves
gratefully.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it wasn't for his mother,'' says Jenny Marcus, an AIDS
volunteer at the hospital's clinic, ``he would have been gone long
ago. She's seen him at death's door. She's been brilliant. She's
fussed over him every waking moment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Do they have this disease in America?'' Lettie Davis wants to
know.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the townships stretched across this vast land, Soweto, on
the southwestern edge of Johannesburg, remains the best known. But
Alexandra, a few miles north of the city, has always been the
harshest. The white apartheid government used to swoop into
Alexandra and yank black gangsters out, then hang them from the
gallows up in Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
   Even now, the township's swagger bedevils the black government.
There are, indeed, law-abiding citizens in Alexandra. It's just
that those in the squatter camps scattered throughout the township
refuse to budge. Nowadays, ambulance drivers enter Alexandra
without police escort. The township has turned into a carjacker's
haven. The danger keeps a lot of AIDS counselors from coming.
</P>
<P>
   But Venash Murugan is an exception.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone says they're scared driving into the township,''
Murugan says while driving into the township. ``If something's
going to happen, it's going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   He's rolling down a road, past some scattering goats, to see
Sonny Boy Khumalo and Pete Mogapi.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll meet Sonny Boy. A fantastic person, a lovely person,''
Murugan says. ``At one point, we thought we were going to lose
Sonny Boy. He was quite on the bad side.''
</P>
<P>
   Murugan says Sonny Boy lied to get girls, telling them he owned
a business, that he could provide jobs. The girls hopped into bed
with him. ``Sonny Boy is still sleeping around,'' Marugan says. ``I
know there was a time he wasn't using condoms. Basically, he
couldn't afford condoms. Still, I know so many friends who say,
`Why should I wear a condom?' They say, `I want flesh to flesh.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Murugan enters the local clinic. A security guard locks the
gate. Sonny Boy is here, but Pete is not.
</P>
<P>
   Sonny Boy Khumalo is 41 years old. He has worked as a gas
station attendant and a machine operator. He has a wife and four
kids. He's wearing a multicolored sweater, slacks, and scuffed-up
shoes. He's been HIV-positive for three years. Mary is his wife.
``She's afraid to get tested,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was growing up I had five girlfriends,'' Sonny Boy
adds.
</P>
<P>
   Sonny Boy says he is trying to keep his illness a secret. He's
petrified that his only sister might find out. ``She'll tell every
Dick, Tom, and Harry,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Murugan asks Sonny Boy if he is seeing women other than his
wife. ``No,'' Sonny Boy says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe you,'' Murugan says.
</P>
<P>
   Sonny Boy laughs awkwardly.
</P>
<P>
   Sonny Boy and Murugan are worried about Pete. His cell count has
been dropping steadily for the past few weeks. Pete had an
appointment in Johannesburg and missed it.
</P>
<P>
   Sonny Boy and Murugan hop in the car to find Pete. Sonny Boy
finds Pete's sister and she goes to get Pete, scooting off between
an expanse of low-ceilinged shacks. Pete's coming now, a stalk of a
man with honey-brown skin and exhausted eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Pete Mogapi is 36 years old.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I cough,'' Pete says, ``blood comes up.'' He is
recovering from a bout of diarrhea and the flu. He lives with his
aunt and three sisters. Pete says he can't get any sleep at night.
``I hear gunshots. Every night,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Murugan grows angry that Pete has been missing appointments at
the clinic. ``If you don't come to the hospital, you know I'm not
scared to come in here and I will give you a good spanking,''
Murugan says to Pete.
</P>
<P>
   Pete's home is tiny. Even in daylight, it is dark. The toilet is
outside. The conditions aren't sanitary. Sonny Boy wants some fresh
vegetables for Pete, but the best he might be able to do is some
goat meat his father is grilling outside. Sonny Boy's father is
wearing white patent leather shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Sonny Boy tells Marugan not to worry, that he will get Pete to
the clinic.
</P>
<P>
   Soon Murugan is in his car. ``It's best to get out of here
before sunset,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Driving, Venash Murugan gets to talking about his own life. He
is from India. In the days of apartheid, he walked around with an
Italian passport. He tried to pass. The white restaurants wouldn't
seat him. He feels left out by history's changes. ``In the old
South Africa I wasn't white enough,'' he says. ``In the new South
Africa, I'm not black enough.''
</P>
<P>
   He earned money modeling. He got married _ to a man. (Later
he'll exuberantly share the newsclippings with a visitor). The
marriage didn't last. Now he has a new lover.
</P>
<P>
   Venash Murugan also has AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not afraid of dying,'' he says. ``I just don't want to
suffer.''
</P>
<P>
   Every day, hundreds of cars and pedestrians pass the white house
a mile from downtown Johannesburg and have no idea that there are
bodies buried in the backyard.
</P>
<P>
   It's called St. Christopher's. William Longman runs the house.
It's full of tender mercies.
</P>
<P>
   It's a house for men with AIDS who have nowhere else to go.
Their families have mostly shunned them.
</P>
<P>
   Longman sits on a sofa, puffing a cigarette. He says the home
depends on charitable contributions. ``Woolworth's gives us their
expired food,'' he says of a local grocery store. ``Some days
you'll get 100 cabbages and nothing else.''
</P>
<P>
   A local mortician volunteers his services free. Even if Longman
calls him in the middle of the night, the man bounces from bed,
comes to pick up the body, and drives it away.
</P>
<P>
   Ten men currently live at the house. There is only one black.
The residents are asked to pay a nominal fee, the equivalent of $30
a month. ``The blacks can't afford that,'' says Longman.
</P>
<P>
   In this land, a lot still comes down to black and white.
Cornelius Monaheng, 28, is the sole black occupant of St.
Christopher's. He says he contracted AIDS from a girl from Zimbabwe
who he met on the streets and fell in love with. ``I'm sure you are
aware that in Zimbabwe one in four people are infected with AIDS,''
he says, in a tone filled with both awe and sadness.
</P>
<P>
   On the day Monaheng went to the hospital to get his test
results, he says he was worried and fearful. ``It was a Monday,''
he recalls. ``There are professional counselors there. I waited
until it was my turn. I went into the room to hear my results. The
counselors asked me if I wanted them to tell me the results or if I
wanted to read it for myself. I said for them to read it to me.
Then I was told I was positive. Hell started into my life that
day.''
</P>
<P>
   He floundered on the streets. He grew angry. A nurse rescued him
and helped get him into St. Christopher's.
</P>
<P>
   Now he finds himself changing the diapers of dying Afrikaners.
``As a black person,'' he says, ``I've been very strong to them.''
</P>
<P>
   There are no funds to provide for proper burials of those who
die at St. Christopher's, Longman says, so they settle on
cremations. Then the ashes of the dead are placed in a little
decorative box and the box is buried in the backyard. Longman asks
the residents which color flower they'd like to have over their
grave _ green or purple.
</P>
<P>
   Longman is in the backyard now, pointing. ``This is Jan. This is
John. This is Chris. This is Warren. He died in January of '99. We
had three that month.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunlight is falling through the trees. He moves to another part
of the yard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here we have Robert. Then we have Peter. And this one is
Steven. Here we have Danny. And, there, Lionel.''
</P>
<P>
   Tiptoeing across the land of the dead and the dying, staring
into the ground, he finishes: ``And there, Mitch and Lionel.''
</P>
<P>
   Most were partial to the purple flowers.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The voice at the other end of the line sounds cautious. Madame
Durell gets all sorts of crank calls, from people shopping around
for false breasts or lingerie in men's sizes, or from voyeurs like
me.
</P>
<P>
   Some desperate souls will stop at nothing to take a peek inside
Madame Durell's decadent villa in Spandau.
</P>
<P>
   Credentals established, I ring the bell at the gate of the
International School of Travesty. An alsatian growls menacingly,
the front door opens, and Madame Durell stands on the threshold. He
squeezes my hand firmly.
</P>
<P>
   The place looks like the high-class brothel it is rumored to be
in the neighborhood: tasteful antique furniture at ground level and
an all-marble interior straight out of Pompeii down below. At the
far end of the pool in the basement stands a mini-jungle of plastic
palm trees, backing on to one of the establishment's many walls of
mirrors.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors will spend hours ogling their reflections, watching
their shapes, movements and mannerisms slowly transcend the
boundary of gender.
</P>
<P>
   It takes four months to turn a willing male into a passable
female, at least in outward appearance. Four months and Dm35,000
(nearly $20,000). That's how much the course in travesty costs, at
the end of which successful students receive a state-recognized
diploma from Madame Durell, a chartered travesty pedagogue.
</P>
<P>
   This is, after all, a serious educational establishment. On
Berlin's bustling variety scene, travesty is regarded as one of the
highest forms of art, and Madame Durell, who goes by the name of
Sascha Nowak-Tarnawa in his passport, as one of its greatest
exponents.
</P>
<P>
   Berlin, he says, boasts more registered travesty artists _ some
620 _ than any other city in the world. And while New York has its
transvestite school and Amsterdam a school for transsexuals, his is
the only establishment in the world dedicated to the noble art of
cross-dressing.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone understands the school's true mission. ``We have
women aged between 50 and 65 who want to learn striptease for the
benefit of their husbands,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Nowak-Tarnawa is the old-fashioned type. He does not believe
in ``using the human body _ male or female _ for entertainment,
unless it's in the cultural context.''
</P>
<P>
   And his standards are rigorous: only art of the most sublime is
to be pursued on his premises. ``We have an entrance exam. When we
find out that the applicant is just a drag queen, he has to go,''
says Mr. Nowak-Tarnawa.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, he admits the school gets all sorts. One of the
star pupils is a 74-year-old blind psychoanalyst _ happily married
_ who is here to find out what makes women click. He is only doing
the dance part of the course.
</P>
<P>
   Torsten, a 27-year-old waiter, is signed up for the full Monty.
He is unsure whether dressing up as a woman is his real calling,
but he loves playing roles, especially the role of women. Today is
Torsten's first day at Madame Durell's school. He is excited, and a
little nervous.
</P>
<P>
   We take the elevator up to Madame Durell's boudoir: yet more
marble, gilded taps, exquisite robes hanging in the wardrobe, among
them an embroidered folk costume from Mr. Nowak-Tarnawa's native
Poland.
</P>
<P>
   Torsten's first lesson is makeup. He picks out the longest false
eyelashes, applies the foundation with care, but is a little
overexuberant with the lipstick. An hour passes, and Torsten is
still not ready.
</P>
<P>
   We chat as he applies the brush strokes and plucks his eyebrows.
He worked on a cruise liner for two years, scraping the pennies
together for the course.
</P>
<P>
   He would not say it was his life's ambition to go around dressed
in women's clothes, and nor was the family terribly excited about
his further education. ``My mother was taken aback at first, but
now she is more relaxed and says: `If that's what makes you happy,
go ahead.'''
</P>
<P>
   His friends think it is a great idea. ``But I know there is a
lot of work ahead of me.'' More, maybe, than he had reckoned with.
From the makeup room, Torsten goes to the room next to the swimming
pool for a singing lesson.
</P>
<P>
   Standing ramrod straight, feet spread out next to the keyboard
in his black ballet shoes, black trousers with a white line running
down the sides and black sweater, he resembles an overgrown
penguin. Not to worry _ the posture lesson comes later.
</P>
<P>
   Julia, the Polish singing teacher, strikes a few keys. Torsten
has to sing the notes, and he does it well. He has a beautiful
baritone voice, but, alas, cannot rise to the high Cs.
</P>
<P>
   The acting class goes better. Priscilla, an actress from
California who plans to stage deaf cabaret next year in Devon,
England, devises a series of situations for her new student.
</P>
<P>
   ``You come through the door, you are a hero,'' she instructs.
Torsten enters, strutting unconvincingly. ``Let's try something
else,'' she says. ``You will now play a queen.'' Torsten obliges,
delicately guiding the imaginary crinoline through the gap of the
door, and this time the illusion works.
</P>
<P>
   Then it's on to the dance floor, with another American teacher,
Donna, in attendance. First Torsten is a chorus girl, wriggling his
hips to the theme song from ``Cabaret.'' You can tell he has done
this sort of thing before. ``He's doing well,'' whispers Priscilla.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is some Mozart, with Torsten, a head taller than his
teacher, led around the floor. It will take a while before he
masters this, but if he turns out to be good, he will get a chance
to dance Flamenco in high heels.
</P>
<P>
   Torsten has worked hard on his first day, and as a reward is
allowed to wear Madame Durell's silk dress.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to tell four months before graduation, but he looks
promising. ``We still have to work on the style,'' says Mr.
Nowak-Tarnawa. ``But when you know who you are, it will all fall
into place.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG _ Two million Africans south of the Sahara died of
AIDS last year, five times the number of AIDS-related deaths in the
United States since the disease was discovered nearly two decades
ago.
</P>
<P>
   But that is just the beginning of the devasation to come in
southern Africa.
</P>
<P>
   More than 22.5 million people in the region carry the
AIDS-causing human immunodeficiency virus. Of the 11 people
worldwide infected every minute with HIV, 10 of them live in
sub-Saharan Africa. Half of all babies born there are infected with
HIV.
</P>
<P>
   Five countries bundled together in southern Africa now form the
global epicenter of the epidemic. South Africa counts 1,600 new
infections a day, the highest rate in the world, while in Namibia,
Botswana, Zimbabwe, and Swaziland, one in four adults carries HIV.
It is estimated that 90 percent of those infected do not know it,
and therefore aren't aware when they might transmit the virus to
their partners.
</P>
<P>
   Within five years, today's staggering infection rates will yield
horrific consequences. Sixty-one of every 1,000 children born in
the five countries won't reach their first birthday, the United
Nations estimates, and by 2001, it is projected that there will be
13 million AIDS orphans in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The statistics indicate what few officials in this region are
willing to admit: that sub-Saharan Africa faces a crisis of
shattered mores, where sexuality is no longer guided by traditional
norms. In an environment where old rules have clashed with, or been
eclipsed by, rapid social change, African men are killing
themselves _ and their women and children _ with sex.
</P>
<P>
   Hiding behind an historical reluctance to speak openly about
sex, African political and religious leaders have failed to
acknowledge this deeper cultural crisis at the root of the AIDS
epidemic. And international experts, averse to sounding judgmental
or racist, tread lightly on the epidemic's behavioral
undercurrents. Behavior, consequently, has been narrowly defined as
simply having safe sex. But as effective as condoms are in stopping
the transmission of HIV, they do not stop epidemics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without addressing behavior, the response to prevention
strategies will always be limited,'' said Elhadj As Sy, head of the
United Nations AIDS program for Eastern and Southern Africa, based
in Pretoria. ``We'll create some results here and there, but unless
there is a fundamental change in behavior, there will be no drastic
change in the evolution of the epidemic.''
</P>
<P>
   HIV is transmitted primarily through heterosexual contact in
sub-Saharan Africa. The alarming spread of the disease has been
fueled by larger factors: rapid political and economic change,
Westernization, migrant labor, poverty, and gender inequality.
Promiscuity, however, is quickly dismissed in Africa as a racist
term: code, in fact, for the myth of the black man's unbridled
libido.
</P>
<P>
   But AIDS experts throughout the region agree that far too little
is understood about sexual dynamics in modern African societies.
Important questions thus arise: Why, for example, are teachers the
third highest HIV-infected job group in Namibia, after truckers and
the military? Is a man who lives at home but takes many partners
abiding by traditional sexual norms? Why does HIV spread fastest
among youths, the age group most informed about AIDS and condoms?
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't want to do this research, so there are patterns
of black behavior no one wants to acknowledge,'' said Mary Crewe,
director of the Center for the Study of AIDS at the University of
Pretoria. ``They'd rather lay blame on the apartheid past, which
I'm not sure is right.''
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to what infection rates in sub-Saharan Africa suggest,
HIV is not easy to contract. In a stable and healthy environment,
the probability that an infected man will transmit the virus to an
unprotected woman is less than 2 in 1,000, according to World Bank
figures. But it is easy for that risk to rise. A person afflicted
by other sexually transmitted diseases, which are rampant across
the region, is two to nine times more likely to contract HIV if
exposed to it. And if a man has 10 partners, and the partners have
each had 10 partners, he's potentially been exposed to 100 people.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, several socio-economic factors lead to high levels
of casual sex in sub-Saharan Africa, experts say. The region has
seen serious upheaval for decades, the past 10 years being among
the most turbulent. Genocide in Rwanda and the end of apartheid in
South Africa caused the movement of masses of people; porous
borders, regional development corridors, and political change have
reshaped and extended sexual networks. Poor health care facilities,
meanwhile, leave many without access to quality treatment and
prevention, while high unemployment leaves youths idle.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you see such an epidemic as we have, it points to a very
stressed society,'' said Clive Evian, a South African doctor who
helps industries cope with AIDS-related labor costs. ``HIV
epidemics go with a package: an emerging economy, transitions from
traditional cultures into industrial economies, high levels of
other sexually transmitted diseases, and economic stress on
families.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the factors fanning the AIDS epidemic, migrant labor and
gender inequities have perhaps been the most damaging. Throughout
the century, men from around the region were drawn or conscripted
to work in distant gold, mineral, and diamond mines. They left
their families behind in rural villages, lived in squalid all-male
labor camps, and returned home maybe once a year. Lacking education
and recreation, the men relied on little else but home-brewed
alcohol and sex for leisure.
</P>
<P>
   A man who makes his living deep inside a South African gold mine
has a 1 in 40 chance of being crushed by falling rock, so the
delayed risks of HIV seem comparatively remote. Mining companies
pay out $18 million a year in wages to 88,000 workers in the pits
of Carletonville, the center of South Africa's gold industry. The
wages buy, among other things, sex. Some 22 percent of adults in
Carletonville were HIV-positive in 1998, according to UNAIDS, a
rate two-thirds higher than the national average.
</P>
<P>
   ``High alcohol and sexuality are symptoms of things going wrong
on a big scale,'' Evian said. ``They reflect a kind of aggression,
the sad social state of the man. They have been thrown into
horrible lives and become frustrated. It would happen to any man
anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Most African women, meanwhile, live in poverty. They have little
or no economic control, and therefore virtually no say in sexual
relationships. ``Women know they are in danger, but there is
nothing they can do about it,'' said Lahja Shiimi, HIV/AIDS health
program officer in northern Namibia. ``Men decide when to have sex,
with whom to have it, and how.''
</P>
<P>
   Physiologically four times more susceptible to HIV infection,
women in the region are contracting the virus at a faster rate than
men, and at a younger age. Most of the women who tested positive
for HIV in Namibia in 1998, government figures show, were in their
early 20s, while most men were in their mid-30s. According to the
latest UNAIDS statistics, 46.7 percent of Namibian women at rural
prenatal clinics tested positive in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   If mobility, migrant labor, and gender imbalance are conducive
to the swift spread of HIV, they also underscore the breakdown of
social cohesion. When truckers and miners go home, they take the
virus with them. Sometimes they infect their wives, sometimes women
become infected through sexual contact with other men while their
husbands are away. Rural infection rates are catching up to urban
figures. The role men traditionally played as head of the family
has broken down. Boys grow up without fathers. Wives are left
impoverished and unprotected. A South African woman is raped every
26 seconds, the highest rate in the world.
</P>
<P>
   But socio-economic arguments about AIDS do not fully explain how
sexual relationships are changing as African societies evolve.
Notions about masculinity and fertility vary widely among Africa's
diverse ethnic groups. Health workers across southern Africa agree,
however, that traditional cultures had strict rules governing
sexual relationships. Those codes have broken down and nothing has
replaced them.

   JOHANNESBURG _ Hector was a nobody with few girls. And so he got
them. For the price of a warm beer he had a bedtime partner every
night. He'd boast of his conquests like so many boys in this
country boast of their moves on green soccer fields.
</P>
<P>
   Hector's dying now.
</P>
<P>
   Colin found his women in the bars of Hillbrow, the section of
Johannesburg where white liberals used to congregate during the
mean days of apartheid. These days a lot of flesh gets peddled in
Hillbrow. Colin found girl after girl after girl.
</P>
<P>
   Colin's dying now.
</P>
<P>
   Pete and Sonny Boy couldn't stop themselves from bedding women.
Their fathers bedded many women. Sex and more sex was due them,
they felt. A rite of passage.
</P>
<P>
   Pete's dying now, and his girlfriend, Queen, is already dead.
She lies in a township graveyard, right alongside their son,
Manietjies, who was six. They called him little Pete. Little Pete
died four months ago of AIDS. Just like his mother.
</P>
<P>
   The deaths made Sonny Boy blue. But he swears he'll save big
Pete. Big Pete is skinny as wheat. One hundred and five pounds, and
dropping. Sonny Boy needs some fresh fruit and vegetables for Pete,
but doesn't have a dime in his pocket. Still, he believes in
miracles. ``I will care for Pete,'' Sonny Boy swears. ``You will
see.''
</P>
<P>
   Sonny Boy could use a miracle himself. He's dying too.
</P>
<P>
   This is now the land of the dying and the dead. They're all
victims of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   As the AIDS scourge sweeps a wicked path across the continent,
health experts predict that 50 percent of all new infections in
Africa will take place right here, in battle-torn South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most women in this country know their husbands or boyfriends
have multiple partners,'' says Morna Cornell of the
Johannesburg-based AIDS Consortium, a clearinghouse for
organizations fighting the epidemic. Cornell estimates that in the
next five to 10 years, 3.5 million people will die of AIDS in South
Africa. ``It's on a scale unimaginable to anybody else,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Bart Cox, an AIDS activist here, says that ``it's interesting to
talk about promiscuity, but very risky, even dangerous. So many of
these young black males feel a sense of entitlement. Meaning, if
they see a woman as dressing sexy, they think they are entitled to
her.''
</P>
<P>
   All tuckered out and dying, Pete hates that his sexual vigor is
not what it used to be. Not that his new girlfriend knows he's
infected. ``I met her one day and had sex the following day,'' Pete
says, letting a guilt-free smile flower across his face.
</P>
<P>
   Hector Motsoengeng used to work with his grandfather, fixing up
cars. These days he doesn't work. At night he worries about a place
to lay his head. His brother sometimes sneaks him into the military
barracks where he serves, just outside Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
   Hector is sitting in a bare room at a little clinic on the
grounds of the Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital in Soweto. Hector,
28, comes for moral support.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no medicine, but we do have condoms,'' says Tsietsi
Raburabu, a social worker at the clinic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is hard to say who infected me, because I had a lot of
girlfriends,'' Hector says.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of years ago his skin started to break out. ``My
friends said, `You have the AIDS.' I said, `What do you mean?' ''
He's already lost an eye to the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Hector, like virtually all Africans, can't afford dosages of
AZT, the powerful drug that can prolong the life of AIDS sufferers.
Hector says if he could, he wouldn't take the drug anyway. ``I
don't want my body to get used to drugs,'' he explains.
</P>
<P>
   At various points while growing up, Hector says he had as many
as seven girls at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was easy for me to get girlfriends,'' he says. ``I was
playing soccer at school. In South Africa, it's easy to have sex.
You go to a shebeen (bar), buy a girl one beer, and you look at her
and say, `You have to pay me for the beer.' You go to sleep with
her.''
</P>
<P>
   Hector says pressure from his friends was always intense. ``When
we grew up _ always around other boys _ it was peer pressure to
have sex,'' he says. ``I used to tell myself, `I want one
girlfriend,' but if she's not available when I want it, I want
another girl. We grew up telling ourselves, `If you have one
girlfriend, you're not man enough.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Hector had a core group of about a dozen male friends, he says.
``We all used to do the same things. We used to exchange
girlfriends. We grew up in that situation. All of my girlfriends
were nice. They didn't know I had other partners. I would lie. I
would say to them, `You are the only one.' ''
</P>
<P>
   He has settled on one girlfriend now. ``She knows about my
status,'' he says, referring to AIDS. ``She says she doesn't want
to go for a test. She said she'd rather not know. It's a coping
thing. A lot of people who are HIV-positive have committed
suicide.''
</P>
<P>
   The myths about AIDS won't go away.
</P>
<P>
   You can walk along some of the dirt-covered roads in Soweto and
notice eating dishes on the windowsills outside. ``They're forced
by their families to keep their bowls outside the house, like a
dog's bowl,'' Gloria Sidyiyo, an AIDS counselor at the Jabavu
Clinic in Soweto, says about some AIDS sufferers and their
families.

<P>
   Sidyiyo's clinical staff numbers 10, and of those 10, five are
HIV-positive. ``At times I say, `God doesn't love South Africa.' ''
</P>
<P>
   They have 1,800 beds at Johannesburg General Hospital. Two out
of three of the patients in those beds have AIDS. Some are forced
to sleep on trolleys. They're losing 15 a day to the epidemic at
the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are preparing to see a patient,'' says Sally Mbulaheni, a
nurse at a medical-legal clinic on the grounds of the hospital,
``and you go away for a moment, and when you come back to them,
they are a corpse.''
</P>
<P>
   It is the land of the dead and dying.
</P>
<P>
   Lettie Davis is the kind of old South African woman who, in the
days under apartheid, prayed her way from day to day, who raised
her kids in fear, and who wondered if she, or they, would ever see
the great Nelson Mandela while he was locked away in prison. Now
this. Now freedom, and AIDS, and tears because her son Colin is
dying.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I talk, I just can't help dropping my tears,'' Lettie
Davis says. ``A mother hopes, you know.''
</P>
<P>
   Colin Davis spends a lot of his time in a bedroom of the home he
shares with his mother and father and sister. He listens to a lot
of gospel music. ``I pray a lot,'' he says. ``That's my only
hope.''
</P>
<P>
   His sister has asked Colin to confine himself to certain
sections of the house because she fears catching the disease.
Colin's mother, wanting to keep peace, asks Colin to respect the
desires of his sister.
</P>
<P>
   Of her seven children, Lettie Davis says Colin is special.
Lettie was born in Port Elizabeth, the old port city on the Indian
Ocean. It was an impoverished upbringing. ``I lost my parents when
I was young,'' she says. ``I couldn't get more schooling than
standard 6. I said, `My children are not going to suffer.' And now,
here my child is like this today. He's an educated man. He's lived
with whites. The missionairies wanted to take Colin to America to
be a preacher.'' She turns away, wipes a tear. ``I can't talk too
much. I talk, I cry.''
</P>
<P>
   When he was first diagnosed, Colin didn't tell his mother and
father. Then he started losing weight. He looked as if his body
were trying to hide inside its own bones.
</P>
<P>
   Some nights, when Colin gets to coughing, Lettie spreads a
blanket for herself on the floor next to his bed and sleeps next to
him, as if he might vanish in the night. There is a pink blanket on
Colin's bed. His bedroom is tidy. In its own way, even beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got involved with various girls,'' Colin says, out of
earshot of his mother. ``My problem was I never used protection. I
was reckless.''
</P>
<P>
   He says getting the women was easy. ``It's easy if you have a
little bit of money,'' he says. ``Even if you don't have much, long
as you have something.''
</P>
<P>
   At one time, Colin, who is 38, said he had five different sexual
partners. ``They weren't actual prostitutes, but they lived
loosely,'' he admits. ``They would only be too happy to have
someone buy them food or beers.''
</P>
<P>
   He rarely goes out now. No friends come to visit. ``I've
accepted I cannot get involved with any lady in a sexual manner,''
he says.
</P>
<P>
   Colin carries a tiny diary. In it, he keeps his appointments at
the clinic. He takes Bactrim, an antibiotic. It's to keep down
other illnesses, but it hasn't worked very well. He's had pneumonia
and TB. Now, in addition to his AIDS, he's been having heart
problems.

 JOHANNESBURG: ... replaced them.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``In our culture, having a lot of women is a kind of status,''
said Milka Mukoroli, the HIV/AIDS coordinator at Rundu Hospital in
Rundu, Namibia. Under the old rules, ``a man might marry two or
three women, but he would never stray from home, and the first wife
had to be consulted about each new wife.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Mukoroli said, wives never know about their husbands' other
women. Men take lovers furtively. Many traditional cultures frowned
on premarital sex. Today, older men look for young girls to take
care of, seeking sex in exchange for providing school fees and nice
clothes, often in the mistaken belief that sex with virgins can
cure AIDS. Health workers say many male secondary-school teachers
sleep with their female students. A new study of Carletonville
conducted by the Pretoria-based Council for Scientific and
Industrial Research found that 60 percent of women are HIV-positive
by the time they're 25. Throughout sub-Saharan Africa, infection
rates among teenage girls are signficantly higher than teenage
boys. Infected by older men, the girls then infect boys their own
age.
</P>
<P>
   ``Social pressure should be put on older men to avoid forcing or
coercing young girls into sex, or enticing them with sugar daddy
gifts,'' a UNAIDS study on behavior released last month concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Changing behavioral patterns are not restricted to men, AIDS
workers say. Traditionally, women were not supposed to enjoy sex.
Increasingly, however, they are asserting their own sexual needs
and priorities.
</P>
<P>
   `Promiscuity is prevalent predominantly because heterosexual
relationships are changing,'' said Peter Schmidt, a German doctor
serving as chief medical officer in the AIDS-afflicted Ohanguena
region of Namibia. ``This is a very sensitive subject and very
difficult to tackle. So many dependencies in African societies
relate to sexual relations.''
</P>
<P>
   The heterosexual nature of the epidemic does not rule out the
probability that HIV is also transmitted between men, but
homosexuality is deeply closeted in African societies and there are
comparatively far fewer same-sex infections, according to AIDS
experts.
</P>
<P>
   Youths provide a compelling reason to think differently about
behavior. Across the region, young people have been exposed to more
education about HIV and condoms than their elders, yet they have
the highest infection rates. Knowledge about risk and condoms
hasn't slowed the epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   A new study of sexual behavior among youths between the ages of
11 and 24 in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa's hardest hit province,
indicates why: Young people are on their own in an aggressive and
evolving sexual environment without the communication skills
necessary to negotiate the function or frequency of sex in
relationships.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, the social ills governing gender relations among
adults reappear among youths. Both men and women in the study said
that condoms threatened trust within the relationship. Most women
said they were powerless against male sexual coercion. Many from
both sexes said they would prefer abstinence or monogamy, but said
peer pressure is a strong influence.
</P>
<P>
   ``For young people, sex is a must to be taken seriously by their
peers,'' said Christine Varga, research fellow at the Australian
National University in Canberra, currently based at the
Reproductive Health Research Unit in Durban.
</P>
<P>
   Significantly, said Varga, who conducted the KwaZulu-Natal
study, young people feel increasingly isolated from the adults in
their lives. Traditionally, cultures included some mechanism for
passing on the rules of sexuality and intimate relationships to
adolescents. Parents, however, never spoke to their children about
sex. Unmarried aunts or older sisters informed younger nieces or
sisters coming of age. Uncles and older brothers did the same for
boys.
</P>
<P>
   Now confusion prevails. Rural youths in particular ``are much
more likely to evince attitudes that are a combination of old
conservatism and new sexuality,'' Varga said. They combine new
attitudes like ``sex is a must'' with traditional mores such as
``condoms are for prostitutes.'' The result is high-risk sex.
</P>
<P>
   From 1997 to 1998, infections rose 65 percent among South
Africans between the ages of 15 and 19. All too quickly, HIV is
claiming another generation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way to fight the epidemic is not just with condoms. We
have to change mores,'' said Patricio Rojas, the World Health
Organization representative in Namibia. ``Openness happened fast in
Africa, and it happened wrongly. There is no grooming of boys and
girls as partners in a relationship, so sex has no aspects beyond
the instinctively physical. We have to create an environment of
normality again.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW TAFARA, Zimbabwe _ She had to get the babies, her nieces and
nephews. They were sleeping in the jungle, and she thought the
darkness might get them, if not something worse. Their mothers _
her sisters _ were dead, or dying. Their fathers had abandoned
them. She couldn't sleep. The thought of the babies kept waking
her.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were living like animals,'' says Esther Daiton.
</P>
<P>
   She didn't have any money. She had a precious TV; she hawked the
thing without a second thought. But it wasn't enough. She started
begging, got enough cash together, then she hit the road. First by
bus, then foot.
</P>
<P>
   Esther crossed north into Malawi, through Zambia, covering a
distance of several hundred miles. On the days she slept outside,
her body would crumple beneath trees from exhaustion. Her sleep
would be deep. But when awake, she traveled like a woman who didn't
need sleep.
</P>
<P>
   She traveled as fast as her thin legs would take her. And, after
two months of searching, picking up clues, using some of the first
children she found as her guides to the others, her journey was
complete. She had found Tsi Tsi and Paul. She found Fungai. She
found Manyara, Elbe, Allan, and John. Seven in all.
</P>
<P>
   They'd been living as orphans _ orphaned to the jungle. Four
were her two sisters' kids. One sister had died of AIDS, while the
other lay terminally ill with the disease in a hospice. Of the
seven children, three she had never laid eyes on.
</P>
<P>
   Across this drained continent, beset by wars, famine, and
misfortune, the AIDS epidemic has left something else in its wake:
millions of AIDS orphans. By 2001, according to figures presented
last month in Zambia at an international conference on the disease,
the number of AIDS orphans in Africa will reach 13 million.
</P>
<P>
   Zimbabwe has the largest number of AIDS orphans on the continent
_ an estimated 670,000 _ and the number is growing at a rate of
60,000 a year, according to the government-funded National AIDS
Coordinating Program.
</P>
<P>
   ``The social welfare system is not working,'' says Colletta
Peta, a social worker who works at an AIDS hopsice in Harare.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, extended families here and elsewhere across
Africa would be expected to take care of their relatives' homeless
children and even some orphans, leaving the social welfare system
as a last resort. But deaths from AIDS have severely blunted the
effectiveness of the extended family. Now, the orphans seem to be
everywhere, and they are at risk. ``It is a tragedy,'' Peta adds.
``We really can't protect the orphans.''
</P>
<P>
   To keep and protect her babies, Esther Daiton sells popcorn on
the roads of this village, 10 miles outside Harare. She saves her
pennies. ``I pray to God,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   There are nine children lying at her feet in her hut here, the
seven she retrieved from Malawi, plus her natural-born son and
daughter, Peter and Desilyn. Every one of them has lost one _ or
both _ parents to AIDS. The sun is slicing through the cracks of
the hut. The children scamper about like pups. They are hungry, but
there's not a scrap of food in sight.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is all so impossible,'' Esther says.
</P>
<P>
   Esther herself is all bone and skin.
</P>
<P>
   Esther Daiton was born Nov. 11, 1973, in Masvingo, about 180
miles from Harare. Her mother, Neliya, and father, Malinga, lived
and worked on a tobacco plantation. There were six children born to
Neliya.
</P>
<P>
   Esther enjoyed growing up in Zimbabwe. School was fun. In the
9th grade she met Andrew Lyadutu. Actually, he was her teacher. He
asked Esther to marry him. She said yes. She was 14 years old. ``He
lost his job because of the marriage,'' says Esther.
</P>
<P>
   She was young and immature, she admits, about her first
marriage, which ended in divorce. Three years later, still young,
she met Thomas Kabalika. He made all kinds of promises. It was the
marriage vow of fidelity he couldn't keep. ``He was not used to
sleeping inside,'' Esther says. ``He wanted to sleep outside _ with
the prostitutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Esther left him.
</P>
<P>
   Two marriages down, she still had faith. Love was not a word
that frightened Esther Daiton. She met Loton Mafuta. A smooth
talker, he was the kind of man who showed Esther his hard-earned
money at the end of each pay period.
</P>
<P>
   On May 11, 1997, Esther married Mafuta. She was 23 years old.
Her years had been hard, but Africa was Africa, a place where the
clouds were always heavy.
</P>
<P>
   Mafuta had a good job. He managed a construction site. Esther
became a clerk there. She was still living near her home. Her
father had become ill. Esther, like her mother, wiped the sweat
from his brow, brought his medicines to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father used to drink beer at the pubs,'' recalls Esther.
``He would collect other women in the pub and go into the bush.''
</P>
<P>
   Sores broke out all over her father's body; diarrhea weakened
him. The old man _ who really wasn't old at all, he just looked it
_ sat in silence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a hard time,'' says Esther. Her father had AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Not long after his diagnosis, Esther's mother returned to the
hospital with him. Then she, too, was diagnosed with the virus.
``We were at the hospital and the nurses were doing counseling to
my mother,'' says Esther. ``My father apologized to her and said,
`I am the one who did this to you.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Her mother and father were soon admitted to Bonda Hospital,
three miles outside Harare. Esther prepared food for them at home
and took it to the hospital. ``It was difficult,'' she says. ``I
talked to God: `Help me.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The hospital sent Esther's father home. They gave him a a
discharge card. It was stamped ``DH'': Died at Home.
</P>
<P>
   On April 5, 1997, Esther's father died. That's when the dying
began.
</P>
<P>
   Four months later, on Aug. 11, Esther _ who had given birth a
year earlier to little Emmaculate and was suddenly worried because
Emmaculate was sickly _ went to the hospital. Esther had taken an
HIV test weeks earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Her test came back positive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to my house with my child,'' she recalls. ``I started
crying for two hours. I told my sister, Martha, that I went to the
doctor and he told me I was HIV-positive. My sister started
shouting, and said, `I don't want to talk to someone who is
HIV-positive. So leave!' My sister _ my blood sister _ said to some
of my friends, `Esther is already dead.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Esther was alive. But the clouds were rolling in fast.
</P>
<P>
   Nine months after her father died, Esther's mother breathed her
last breath. It was Jan. 4, 1998. Esther pulls a copy of her
mother's death certificate from a sack. ``Vomiting,'' it says, was
the cause of death. In Africa, because of the stigma of the
disease, it is rare for a death certificate to list the cause as
AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Then trouble began brewing in Esther's own marriage. Her husband
was vanishing at night. Away on construction jobs, his time was his
own. ``He would go out in Maputo,'' she says. ``He was paid in US
money. He started using drugs, drinking.'' Esther discovered that
her husband had been sleeping with a friend of hers.
</P>
<P>
   But then Mafuta grew too weak to vanish into the night. He too
broke out in sores. He had chest pains. She wanted to talk about
her HIV status; she hoped for some answers. But he didn't want to
talk to Esther.
</P>
<P>
   On May 20, 1998, men started lifting shovels again. This time,
the length of the plot was quite short: The hole was for
Emmaculate, Esther's 19-month-old daughter. Her little baby. Dead
of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Esther needed money for the coffin, and money to rent the
flatbed truck to haul the coffin to Mabvuku cemetery, 10 miles from
her home. ``I asked friends for money. I sold Popsicles.''
</P>
<P>
   They laid Emmaculate in the ground on a cool, quiet day. Esther
couldn't afford a stone. She laid a little blue dish atop her
daughter's gravesite so she could find it.
</P>
<P>
   She turned her attention to her husband, and again, the shovels
were swinging. Exactly one month after the death of their daughter,
Loton Mafuta died of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Loton had surely passed the disease on to Esther. ``He didn't
apologize either,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   All of her loved ones seemed to be dropping into the ground.
Esther still had her two own children, Peter and Desilyn. But now,
she had lost both her mother and father. She had lost her baby. She
had lost her husband.
</P>
<P>
   She felt lonely. She was also hurting. She walked to the
hospital. She got medicine for stomach ailments. She got medicine
for the flu. She needed money for AIDS drugs, but like almost all
Africans, there was no way she could afford the high cost of such
medication. So she's had to do without it.
</P>
<P>
   Then word flew in like a poisoned dart that her sister, Naipiri,
who had two children _ Tsi Tsi and Paul _ had died in Malawi of
AIDS. Another sister in Malawi, Maria, who had two children named
Manyara and Fungai, was bedridden in a hospice with AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Naipiri's and Maria's children _ Esther's nieces and nephews _
were living as orphans in Malawi. Weeks and months passed. She
slept fitfully when she slept at all. She had to find those babies.
Sick as she was, she had to find them. ``I said to myself, `My
mother and father kept us well. But now my mother and father are
dead. My husband and daughter are dead. My sister is dead. And if I
don't find these children, they will be street children.' ''
</P>
<P>
   A doctor, a nurse, her friends, all told Esther to stay put,
told her the children would have to fend for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Alone, Esther went to the bus depot in August of 1998 and set
out to find them.

 NEW TAFARA, ZIMBABWE: ... find them.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   She was carrying her passport in a little plastic bag. She had a
little money from the sale of her television set. It took her two
days over bumpy roads to reach Malawi, a tiny country set in the
Great Rift Valley of southeastern Africa. Compared to other African
states, marred by wars and strife, Esther couldn't have picked a
better place in which to travel alone. Malawi is peaceful.
</P>
<P>
   She made her way to the central part of the country, where her
sisters had resided, and started asking questions. She got enough
answers to keep moving. She slept in guest houses for $2 a night,
and when the guest houses were full, she slept outside, in the
bush. Some kind souls at the Zimbabwean embassy in the capital,
Lilongwe, gave her some food. Days later, still roaming, she came
upon some women working in a stall of markets alongside a road, and
they gave her more food. She kept going.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just walking around,'' she says. ``I spent two months
sleeping in the bushes. I would tell people I'm from Zimbabwe and
I'm looking for these children.''
</P>
<P>
   There were leads that fell into other leads, only to completely
collapse. And then she spotted the first ones. ``I found Paul and
Allan sleeping outside, in front of a shop.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul was Naipiri's child. She didn't know who Allan's parents
were; he was an orphan who had befriended Paul. Esther scooped him
up. Allan pointed into the bush, in the direction where he and Paul
had laid Fungai, Maria's boy, while they went to look for food.
After a brief search, they found Fungai, alone and screaming.
</P>
<P>
   She was given another tip: A market lady had seen some kids
roaming down a road about a mile away. Esther raced there and
spotted Manyara and Elbe, another orphan the children had
befriended, on the side of a road. Less than an hour later she
found Tsi Tsi near a riverbed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The children didn't know me,'' she says. ``They had forgotten
me. The children were not eating. They were living like animals.''
</P>
<P>
   But now she had all four of her two sisters' children: Fungai
and Manyara, Tsi Tsi, and Paul. There were three other AIDS orphans
she had found with the others that she decided to bring home, too:
John, Allan, and Elbe.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you would have seen me with these children, you would have
thought they were getting ready to die the very next day,'' Esther
says. ``But it was not God's will.''
</P>
<P>
   The clouds were suddenly lighter. She had the babies. Everyone
headed home.
</P>
<P>
   Only when she returned to Zimbabwe, Esther didn't have a home
any longer. She had been staying with her grandfather, but now,
because she had so many children with her, he no longer wanted her
there.
</P>
<P>
   She showed up at a side door of the Faith Ministeries Church in
Harare. She needed some food and she needed some help.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't want them on their property,'' Colletta Peta, the
social worker, says of Esther and the children she cares for. Peta
happened to belong to the church whose door Esther knocked on.
``We've managed to get a shack for them,'' Peta says.
</P>
<P>
   The shack, made mostly of cardboard, is off a dirt road,
squeezed in by other shacks. It is 12 feet high and six feet wide.
It looks something like a cage one might see in a zoo. Esther says
it's better than living in the bush.
</P>
<P>
   There is no running water. Even in Africa, the nights can get
chilly, but Esther and the children have no heat. She's got two
blankets. They're thin, and both have holes in them.
</P>
<P>
   She is crazy about the children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I must love them like they are all with their mothers,''
Esther says. She's sitting on the edge of her tiny bed in the hut.
``It's hard,'' she confesses minutes later, her eyes having
suddenly teared up.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the children, Manyara and Peter, are always sniffling.
Manyara has open sores on her legs. Esther fears the worst, but she
hasn't any money to take them to the clinic to get HIV tests.
</P>
<P>
   One day, not long ago, Esther got her hands on some cash. That
day Fungai was sniffling badly. She rushed him off to the hospital.
``But he was negative,'' she says about Fungai's HIV test.
</P>
<P>
   This is how Esther scrapes money together: She buys Popsicles
wholesale. Then she borrows a cart and pushes it out to the road.
Peter, Desilyn, and Tsi Tsi help her when she's sick. Along with
the Popsicles, she totes sacks of popcorn. And sometimes Allan,
gifted artistically, scrapes up metal pieces he finds and molds
them together, little model figurines. He sells them.
</P>
<P>
   ``How those children struggle day to day,'' says Peta, the
social worker.
</P>
<P>
   There are many mornings, however, when Esther can't lift a
Popsicle, much less push a cart out to the side of the road. It's
her AIDS; it can keep her in bed for days.
</P>
<P>
   She hates going to the hospital. ``At the clinic,'' she says,
``the nurses shun me. When they know you've got AIDS, they don't do
too much.''
</P>
<P>
   She was bedridden just recently. She felt like boulders were
rolling around in her stomach. The children huddled around her in
the hut, their world suddenly reduced to the skin-and-bones woman
lying on the bed. ``They were praying for me,'' she says. ``I said,
`Go play.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Not a child moved.
</P>
<P>
   She's been brutally honest with the kids, but it just tore her
heart that she had to confess to the children that she, too, has
AIDS. ``I tell them I may wake up sick tomorrow,'' Esther says.
``Or I may not wake up at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Each child has a distinct personality, says Esther.
</P>
<P>
   When there is food, says Esther, ``Fungai likes to eat too
much.'' Fungai's smile is wide and sweet. He's 4 years old and AIDS
stole his mother, Maria, who died in May. Fungai prays a lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``John is mischievous in a quiet way,'' Esther says, shooting a
glance at John, who smiles back at her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tsi Tsi likes selling things,'' says Esther. ``Popcorn,
freezies.'' One moment Esther shows off her medicine, strewn around
the little hut. And the next moment, as if by magic, she reaches
under a pile of things and pulls the prettiest school uniform out
that Tsi Tsi wears to school. All ironed.
</P>
<P>
   The children are hers now. ``I must give them all equal love,''
Esther says. ``I cannot favor mine. If I go buy something, I must
give each one the same thing. I must give them equal shares.
Manyara is my child. Fungai is my child.''
</P>
<P>
   A man can't move Esther Daiton's heart anymore. ``If a man says
he loves me again, I will cry. I don't want it. I'm sick.''
</P>
<P>
   Later in the week, Esther has gotten some food. She has borrowed
a hot plate. She fixes margarine sandwiches for the children.
Fungai loves margarine sandwiches. She prepares some tea. Tsi Tsi
cups her tea like an English queen. There is chicken and rice. A
pot falls off the hot plate and a piece of chicken falls onto the
dirt. Fungai scrambles for it in a motion so swift it seems almost
electric. He picks it up and tosses it back in the pot, and takes
his seat again on the dirt.
</P>
<P>
   Not a child touches the food until it all has been placed on
every plate. Until a prayer has been said. The children have lovely
_ since there is no table _ dirt floor manners.
</P>
<P>
   Esther eats her margarine sandwich. She looks exhausted. But all
the children have allowed smiles to flower across their faces.
</P>
<P>
   A day later, the children, after school, after their tea, are
outside playing. Sunshine is everywhere. Everything seems normal.
With the exception of so much death. Six members of her immediate
family, all gone to AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   But Esther lives. She's not exactly happy. The school fees are
due and she hasn't got a dime. The landlord across the road wants
his rent for the shack. She hasn't paid anything in two months. The
man's kindness might run out.
</P>
<P>
   Still, she is happy just to be alive. She was at the hospital
not long ago, having problems breathing. She ached all over. Plans
were made to admit her. ``They wanted to give me a bed,'' she says.
``I said no to the nurses. I had to get back home. The nurses said,
`Why?' I said, `I've got these children.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Esther walked back home, and the children _ her babies, as she
calls them _ loved the sight of her.

SEXUAL ASSUALTS ADDING TO THE PROBLEM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WIL HAYGOOD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOWETO, South Africa _ Her day started beautifully.
</P>
<P>
   Portia Moalusi was out for a stroll with her boyfriend. They
were holding hands, chatting, smiling, just strolling around this
old epic-sized township on the outskirts of Johannesburg. It was a
Sunday this past June.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw two people walking,'' she says. ``I thought they were
lovers. When I started to turn a corner, they approached me with
guns.''
</P>
<P>
   She's sitting in a clinic here, meeting with her doctor.
</P>
<P>
   She goes on:
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `What do you want? I can give you my necklace.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The gun-wielding couple _ immediately joined by another male _
didn't want her necklace. Moalusi's boyfriend was told, at
gunpoint, to flee. He did.
</P>
<P>
   She was hustled into a car. She was blindfolded. Her heart felt
like a boulder. The car came to a halt. It was at the edge of a
river.
</P>
<P>
   Moalusi knew what the men wanted. The woman helped hold her
down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before they started raping me, they pushed my head into the
water,'' she says. ``I felt myself drowning.''
</P>
<P>
   Her doctor, Mary Jane Kumasamba _ who has heard some evil tales
of crime and rape while working as a doctor here _ grimaces. There
were deep genital bruises on Moalusi when the doctor first examined
her.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were shocked by the story,'' the doctor says. ``This is
like Sodom and Gomorrah.''
</P>
<P>
   Portia Moalusi is 29 years old. She's single and unemployed. She
has close-cropped hair and small hands, which she keeps folding and
unfolding in her lap.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told myself I would cooperate because they told me they
would kill me,'' Moalusi says about her abductors.
</P>
<P>
   She said she was repeatedly raped by the men, and recalls quite
vividly the words of the last man who attacked her. ``After he
raped me, he said to me, `I've got something to tell you. I'm
HIV-positive.' I was in shock.''
</P>
<P>
   A rape occurs every 26 seconds in South Africa, the highest rate
of rape in the world, and the country's rate of 1,600 HIV
infections per day is also the highest in the world, almost 14
times greater than in the United States. While there are no numbers
relating the astonishing AIDS figures in South Africa directly to
rape, no one denies that sexual assualts are adding to the problem
significantly.
</P>
<P>
   On this afternoon, Portia Moalusi is waiting for HIV test
results at a clinic on the grounds of the Chris Hani Baragwanath
Hospital. The clinic deals with rape and child abuse cases. Moalusi
and her doctor have agreed to let a reporter sit in while they
wait.
</P>
<P>
   When Moalusi came to the clinic, Dr. Kumasamba did something she
was not supposed to do: She opened the anti retro-viral ``starter
kit'' she keeps in the clinic _ in case any staff member is exposed
to blood _ and gave it to Moalusi. The starter kit consists of two
potent drugs that if given immediately can often halt the virus in
its tracks. In giving the medicine to Moalusi, Kumasamba left
herself and the clinic without any of the drug. ``I knew I was
going to be in trouble,'' she says, ``but there was a life to
save.''
</P>
<P>
   Kumasamba has two large spiral notebooks. They detail the date
of all reported rapes and the names of the victims. They also
report the results of the AIDS tests for those who were raped. More
than half are given the dreadful news that they are HIV-positive.
</P>
<P>
   There is a police officer on duty 24 hours a day at the clinic.
Kumasamba's job is dangerous. When the police arrest someone, she
often testifies on behalf of rape victims, going eye to eye with
the accused in the courtroom. But the police have so far made no
arrests in Portia's rape.
</P>
<P>
   After an hour-long wait, the sounds of clicking heels can be
heard coming down the hallway. The door opens.
</P>
<P>
   ``The results are negative,'' says Sally Mbulaheni, a nurse, who
is allowing herself a smile as she reports the news.
</P>
<P>
   The doctor hugs Moalusi. ``You made it,'' the doctor says.
Moalusi covers her face in her hands, overcome with emotion. ``I'm
so happy,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a victory for us,'' Kumasamba says.
</P>
<P>
   The doctor couldn't bear _ at least in Moalusi's presence _ to
talk about reality. The reality is that Moalusi's first test
results, while gratifying, could take a bitter turn. It can take up
to six months after an infection for the virus to be detected.
``She might still be positive,'' the doctor would say.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the afternoon of the day she received her test results,
Moalusi, standing in front of her home, twirled like a little
child. Then she vanished with something approaching happiness on
her face.

 RUNDU, Namibia: ... is pending.

   ``Eliminating stigma must be central in the response to AIDS,''
Piot said at the Zambia conference. ``We know that three things
contribute most to people learning and acting responsibly on their
status, and thus protecting their community. First, access to
confidential counseling and testing. Second, understanding of the
incentives to do so. And third, the level of support in the
environment in which they live.''
</P>
<P>
   Another area of discrimination involves insurance. Underwriting
companies, bracing against the rising costs of AIDS, often refuse
to cover HIV-positive people or pay benefits to policyholders who
die of AIDS. Across sub-Saharan Africa, doctors often omit AIDS as
a cause of death, indicating on death certificates some other
related illness to help families recover insurance benefits.
</P>
<P>
   For countries that have begun to implement more serious national
responses to the epidemic, Uganda is the model. One of the first to
face a full-blown crisis, the east-African state has been hailed as
a success story. President Yoweri Museveni was outspoken about HIV
long before any of his counterparts, and mobilized his government
to treat AIDS as a concern for all ministries and sectors. The
country encourages people to have confidential HIV tests prior to
marriage and promotes community-based care for those ailing from
advancing AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   After reaching a peak in the early 1990s, when as many as 36.6
percent of urban pregnant women tested positive for HIV, Uganda has
apparently reversed infection rates. By the end of 1997, only 14.8
percent of women attending urban clinics had HIV.
</P>
<P>
   Few argue with the importance of making AIDS a priority in every
government department, as well as teaming up with the private and
volunteer sectors. Namibia and South Africa have begun to adopt
that approach.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Namibian President Nujoma launched a national campaign
against HIV/AIDS that called for a coordinated strategy at the
national, regional, and local levels. The plan spells out goals for
improved health care, education, and antidiscrimination measures.
But the government has allocated only $3.5 million to implement it
over five years, and interviews around the country with officials
responsible for putting the plan to work reveal an ignorance about
what specifically the various programs are supposed to accomplish
once they have been established.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the countries in sub-Saharan Africa, South Africa faces
the fastest-growing AIDS crisis: 1,600 people contract HIV every
day, and within five years more than six million South Africans
will have the virus out of a population of 40 million.
</P>
<P>
   But the country is also the best equipped to respond to the
disease. South Africa has the strongest economy in Africa and the
most sophisticated infrastructure. Still, its response has been
slow. Warnings of an impending catastrophy early in the decade,
when there was still time to avert the worst, went unheeded amid
intense negotiations to end apartheid and the opening years of
majority rule. It wasn't until the closing months of Mandela's
presidency when, last October, then-Deputy President Mbeki outlined
a national response.
</P>
<P>
   Even then, South Africa allocated only about $13 million to
AIDS-related education and care programs over five years. By
contrast, the government is spending roughly $6.5 billion on new
military hardware, including three German submarines for a navy
that faces no threat.
</P>
<P>
   Now president, Mbeki shows signs of understanding the threat
AIDS poses to his goals of improving the lives of the impoverished
black majority. But government is still more focused on the medical
aspects of HIV/AIDS, rather than on behavior and care and
assistance for people with HIV and their families. South Africa,
for example, will spend more than $10 million over the next three
years on vaccine research for the subtype of the HIV virus most
prevalent in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials, critics say, also show a surprising lack
of knowledge about the epidemic. The new health minister, Manto
Tshabalala-Msimang, won accolades for traveling to Uganda shortly
after assuming office in June to learn from that country's
experience. But her major initiative so far has been to rally
religious leaders to help build awareness from the pulpit, despite
the numerous studies indicating that ignorance is no longer a
critical problem. Tshabalala-Msimang did not respond to requests
for an interview.
</P>
<P>
   In August the education ministry published new rules pertaining
to HIV in schools. The policy outlines in detail how to administer
first aid to superficial wounds, despite acknowledging that HIV is
rarely transmitted through casual contact with open cuts.
Conspicuously absent are specific guidelines for sex education in
the classroom and punitive measures for teachers caught having sex
with students.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to explain these omissions last week, Education Minister
Kader Asmal said ``these are matters for further discussion.'' He
added: ``Teachers are embarrassed to give the facts, but the taboos
must give way.''
</P>
<P>
   The country is only just now beginning to deal seriously with
violence against women, one of the most menacing causes for the
spread of HIV. Despite new legislation broadening the definition of
rape _ a woman is raped every 26 seconds in South Africa _ and
imposing new minimum sentencing requirements, courts still show
surprisingly calloused attitudes.
</P>
<P>
   In August, a high court judge in Bloemfontein sentenced a
23-year-old man previously convicted of a sex-offense to just 10
years in prison for abducting and repeatedly raping two 15-year-old
girls. In his ruling, Judge Dirk Kotze argued that the attacks were
simply the result of the man's virility, and that the victims were
not virgins at the time they were raped.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, religious leaders throughout sub-Saharan Africa
have been mostly silent about the epidemic, despite the obvious
role they could play in addressing behavior, counseling, and caring
for orphans. Bishop Sikongo in Rundu says part of the reason is
condoms. The Roman Catholic Church, for example, won't advocate
condoms because they interfere with conception and because it might
appear to be condoning types of sexual behavior that do not conform
with church doctrine. Not knowing how else to respond, Sikongo
said, his brethren have done nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Condoms are the easy way out,'' he said. ``They don't require
sexual responsibility. We would like to see the human take charge
of himself. But we have not promoted our view vigorously.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Barry Hughes-Gibbs, an Anglican priest near Pretoria,
has been providing care for HIV-infected adults, children, and
their families since 1994. The people he helps live in abject
poverty, and the premise of his project is to help them move from
dependence to a degree of self-suffficiency. In addition to feeding
and treating patients, he also employs them in the program.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes-Gibbs' program relies on foreign donors and receives no
help from the government. Earlier this year, without explanation,
Gauteng Province stopped sending subsidies _ about $50 per adult
and $150 per child. Nor does his own organization support him.
Hughes-Gibbs half-jokingly says the project, which currently cares
for 2,500 children and more than 4,000 adults, is successful
because it isn't tied to the church.
</P>
<P>
   ``The church, and by that I don't just mean my own, is doing
nothing,'' he said. ``There are a few in the clergy who are
fighting rifles-against-tanks battle. But most give AIDS lip
service at best, and many deny that it is in their own
congregations.''
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of commitment from political and religious
leaders, nongovernmental organizations are left to do the heavy
work of testing, counseling, and caring for those with HIV and
AIDS. And communities have begun finding innovative ways to address
the epidemic at their level.
</P>
<P>
   Some Zulu villages hold ceremonies to test boys and girls for
virginity. If they pass they are given certificates and special
status. Others act out the dangers and consequences of AIDS through
traditional dances.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are not putting enough pressure on African
governments,'' Caldwell said at last month's conference in Zambia.
``African governments are not putting enough pressure on Western
governments and international systems. The conspiracy of silence
must be broken.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   RUNDU, Namibia _ On a continent where the common official
response to the AIDS plague is denial, Bishop Joseph Sikongo speaks
with rare candor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody has been outspoken,'' the Roman Catholic elder said in
an interview here, referring to government leaders as well as his
ecclesiastical brethren. ``Just now, when we see people dying, we
are beginning to pay attention. But we have not been focused, and
we have failed to meet our responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Every year, AIDS kills 10 times more Africans than die in wars
annually, and poses the single biggest threat to development on the
continent, yet very few leaders _ in parliament or the pulpit _
have anything to say about it. Sub-Saharan countries spend about
$160 million fighting 4 million new AIDS cases per year, and most
of that is foreign aid, according to US government figures. By
contrast, the United States spends $880 million on just 44,000 new
cases annually.
</P>
<P>
   ``By any measure, the HIV-AIDS epidemic is the most terrible
undeclared war in the world, with the whole of sub-Saharan Africa a
killing field,'' said UNICEF executive direcor Carol Bellamy last
month in Lusaka, Zambia, in a speech at the annual conference on
AIDS in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Strikingly, no African heads of state attended the meeting, the
most important periodic conference on the African AIDS epidemic.
Not even Zambian President Frederick Chiluba, whose office is just
minutes away.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a need for political commitment at the highest level,
and little explanation for why that commitment is not there,'' said
John Caldwell, who attended the conference as an expert on Africa
from the Australian National University in Canberra. ``AIDS must be
the central issue on the African political agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   A few African leaders, such as South Africa's Thabo Mbeki and
Ethiopia's Negasso Gidada, have begun to move the AIDS epidemic
higher on their priority lists. But most remain silent or pay the
problem only lip service, leaving the international community and
underfunded private organizations to confront the epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   This reticence has had dire consequences. Existing AIDS-related
laws are not enforced, allowing discrimination to go unchecked.
Stigmas endure. Treatments remain costly and inaccessible. Rape and
other sexual violence flourish. Insurance companies refuse to cover
people infected by the human immunodeficiency virus, which causes
AIDS, and withhold benefits to families of policyholders who have
died of the disease. Half-hearted education efforts make little
impact on risky behavior.
</P>
<P>
   These factors ``drive the epidemic underground,'' where it
continues its sweep through the population, said Mark Heywood,
director of the AIDS Law Project at the University of the
Witswatersrand in Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
   More than 15 years into the now-raging AIDS epidemic, as African
countries strive to cope with the burden of rising death rates,
official denial is hard to fathom. AIDS, it is widely suspected,
has taken a personal toll at the highest levels of government.
Corridors buzz in every country with stories of ranking politicians
who have died or lost family members to untimely deaths. Namibian
President Sam Nujoma lost two sons and a daughter-in-law. Bennie
Mwiinga, Zambia's minister of local government and housing, died on
the eve of the AIDS conference last month, leaving delegates to
speculate about the end of a young and prominent political figure.
</P>
<P>
   In each case, the official cause of death was listed as
something else, though Western diplomats and some African health
experts all said privately that AIDS was the culprit. Former
Zambian President Kenneth Kaunda admitted that he lost a son to the
disease, and the preeminent South African judge Edwin Cameron has
disclosed his positive HIV status. But Africa, sadly, still awaits
its Magic Johnson, someone of mass popular appeal stepping forward
with personal testimony to break the myth and stigmas of the
epidemic, to say unequivocally that AIDS affects everyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``These leaders don't understand that they just leave people
laboring to explain why they are silent,'' said Beatrice Were of
Uganda's International Community of Women Living with HIV/AIDS, an
advocacy group. ``They deepen the stigmas attached to AIDS.''
</P>
<P>
   The silence may be rooted in fear of failure. African leaders do
nothing, Caldwell argues, because they think they cannot influence
the sexual behavior of their most important constituency: young and
middle-aged men. They may also be bound by traditional African
taboos about sex. Such issues are seldom brought into the open, let
alone discussed between partners. Few couples, experts on African
sexuality say, communicate about the role of sex within their own
relationships.
</P>
<P>
   As former South African President Nelson Mandela said last March
in one of his last official comments about AIDS, ``HIV/AIDS is one
of those critical issues which demand visible leadership. . . . Why
understand why there is this silence? It is because transmission
occurs primarily through sex, which is not openly discussed.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin Foreman, director of the AIDS project at the Panos
Institute, a London-based research center, raises another possible
reason for official reticence: traditional notions about African
masculinity. Men, he argues, are supposed to be emotionally and
physically strong. Many cultures expect men to have multiple sexual
partners. Powerful leaders see the AIDS epidemic as threatening
their status, both as men and as officeholders, Foreman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that no heads of state went to the Lusaka meeting is
a negative sign. It is not coincidential that they are all men,''
Foreman added. ``Political, community, and religious leaders in
Africa are men. The male self-identity is dependent on the sexual
identity. For many men, any attempt to discuss and restrict sex
belittles their masculinity. That's part of what's going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason, the lack of political will has had
measureable consequences. In study after study across sub-Saharan
Africa, most people indicate that they have a basic knowledge of
how HIV spreads, how to block transmission, and that the virus is
lethal. But they also do not perceive themselves to be in danger.
While an increase in knowledge about HIV and AIDS has resulted in
marked changes in sexual behavior in countries like the
Netherlands, Australia, and Thailand, awareness has not resulted in
a decrease in high-risk behavior in the majority of sub-Saharan
African countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``The knowledge of HIV is high, but disassociated with risk,''
said Karen Tate of the information and education department of the
Ministry of Health in Rundu, one of the most affected areas in
Namibia. ``So even if people say they know about HIV, there is a
gap between that knowledge and behavior. Behavior is based on
immediate needs,'' rather than prevention of something that poses
delayed risks.
</P>
<P>
   Infection rates remain stubbornly high as a result, especially
among the youngest age groups of sexually active adults,
ironically, those most aware of the dangers of the virus and how to
protect themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Ten African countries, most represented by their health
ministers, declared AIDS a national disaster during the Zambia
conference last month. They committed themselves to providing more
political leadership, increasing resources devoted to a national
response to the epidemic, and making HIV/AIDS a priority in all
developmental programs. They also vowed to introduce initiatives to
address behavior and encourage discussion to create a more
supportive environment for those infected and dying.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's coming through is that there is starting to be
accountability at the highest level,'' said UNAIDS director Peter
Piot in an interview. ``But denial is still a fundamental aspect of
the epidemic. Some African leaders are speaking out, in some places
the machinery is in motion, but that doesn't mean we have action.''
</P>
<P>
   The new resolve spelled out in the declaration also begs
questions about how African countries apply AIDS-related laws and
policies already on their books, as well as about the budgetary
decisions they make. In 1997, the countries of the Southern African
Development Community, a trade bloc, adopted a code for HIV/AIDS
and employment, agreeing to incorporate its provisions in national
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Requiring important education programs and protection of
workers' rights, the code aims ``to ensure nondiscrimination
between individuals with HIV infection and those without, and
between HIV/AIDS and other comparable health/medical conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   But national priorities have not reflected adherence to the best
intentions of the code. South Africa has one of the world's most
liberal constitutions, but its military is one of the leading
discriminators against people with HIV/AIDS. People must submit to
mandatory HIV screening and test negative prior to being allowed
into the service.
</P>
<P>
   AIDS activists believe one of the best ways to lessen he stigma
attached to HIV is to assure confidentiality. Yet several countries
have engaged in new debate this year on whether disclosure promotes
the common good. Politicians argue that notification meets a
society's need to monitor the epidemic. Speaking after a regional
meeting of health ministers in April, Namibian Health Minister
Libertina Amathila said ``the situation as it is now protects only
the sufferers but not the community. The special confidentiality
accorded afflicted people encourages them to infect others at
random without being detected.''
</P>
<P>
   Many AIDS experts denounce such arguments, saying that
confidentiality is essential to encouraging people to learn their
status and inform their partners. Notification to interested
parties such as employers, they say, is a fundamental violation of
the right to privacy and only promotes discrimination. In South
Africa, a government proposal would require any health care worker
who diagnoses a person as HIV-positive to file a report containing
the patient's age, sex, race, medical condition, and ``probable
source and place of infection.'' It also would force the health
officer to inform family members and others giving care to the
patient. The initiative is pending.

OFFICIALS PRODDED ON DISCRIMINATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KURT SHILLINGER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG _ In a cavernous warehouse on the University of the
Witswatersrand campus, nestled at the end of a long corridor, a
modest band of lawyers works to ensure that AIDS ranks as high as
possible on the government's list of competing priorities.
</P>
<P>
   The AIDS Law Project _ three attorneys and four support staff _
sees the epidemic not just as a health issue, but as a litmus test
of the government's commitment to the fundamental human rights
enshrined in South Africa's new constitution. With minimal
resources, they poke at decision makers and prod at corporate
captains to defend the dignity of those who carry the AIDS virus or
are dying from it.
</P>
<P>
   It is frustrating work. While top-level leaders form committees
and talk about building awareness, they do almost nothing to break
the stigmas associated with AIDS. People living with HIV still have
very little support.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe if we challenge discrimination, at the end of the
day that will assist effective HIV prevention,'' said Mark Heywood,
director of the project. ``We want people to live longer, better,
with more dignity. But there are worrying trends: Some practices of
discrimination are being alleviated while others are becoming more
restrictive.''
</P>
<P>
   The Law Project is recognized throughout southern Africa as a
clearinghouse of information on thorny legal issues such as
mandatory notification of HIV test results, a policy debate now
pending in several countries, including South Africa. But much of
the project's work is devoted to individual cases of
discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   In one case, the project is suing South African Airways on
behalf of an HIV-positive client who was denied a job due to the
company's policy of mandatory HIV testing as a condition of
employment for cabin attendants. The law project also has several
civil medical malpractice suits heading to court in the coming
months. One sues a doctor over the physician's failure to gain a
patient's consent prior to testing, then withholding the results.
In another case, blood was taken from a patient for one purpose and
then screened without permission for HIV. Similarly, three other
cases challenge the South African military's policy of mandatory
testing prior to service.
</P>
<P>
   The Law Project also plays a watchdog role on public policy
issues, seeking stronger antidiscrimination language in landmark
labor and health reforms. ``Parliament is just not up to scratch on
these issues,'' Heywood said.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance poses a special challenge. A 1988 law made it legal
for companies to deny coverage to HIV-positive workers. As a
result, the insurance industry now administers more tests than the
medical community, Heywood said, and does so without providing for
pre- and post-test counseling.
</P>
<P>
   The insurance question is critical in South Africa because banks
require life coverage for anyone seeking a mortgage. Heywood and
his lawyers have been lobbying banks to change that policy, and
have sought ways around it in negotiated deals between their
clients and individual bankers.
</P>
<P>
   The Law Project's highest-profile concern, however, is the
killing of a Durban woman who admitted in public that she had HIV.
Gugu Dlamini was fatally assaulted last November on the evening
after she revealed her status. Four men were eventually arrested
for the attack, but prosecutors dropped the charges in August,
saying they lacked sufficient evidence to prosecute.
</P>
<P>
   The Law Project has scrutinized the case throughout, and at one
point pressured the provincial prosecutor in Kwa-Zulu/Natal to
appoint new investigators. When the charges were dropped, Heywood
circulated a scathing letter across the Internet, attacking other
AIDS advocacy groups for neglecting the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Put cynically,'' he wrote, ``Gugu has served her purpose. Her
name has probably been used in numerous funding proposals _ and
that's it. Gugu was as dispensable as the thousands of other
avoidable and premature deaths that take place every month, because
poor marginalized black people can't afford treatments and their
agonies are too easily overlooked.''
</P>
<P>
   Partly because of the Law Project's work, Dlamini's case has not
died completely. It was recently raised again in debate before
Parliament's justice committee, and the deputy prosecutor in
Kwa-Zulu/Natal, Gey van Pittius, has ordered a formal inquest for
later this year, at which Heywood's team will be able to
cross-examine witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anyone doubts that stigma is as alive and powerful as it
was 15 years ago, they need only remember what happened to Gugu
Dlamini, and what happens every day to millions of people living
with HIV,'' said Peter Piot, executive director of UNAIDS, at an
AIDS conference in Zambia last month. ``We too often forget that
stigma remains our most significant challenge in AIDS.''

BLACK LEADERS IN U.S. CONFRONT THE ISSUE 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WIL HAYGOOD  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stunned by the soaring number of AIDS deaths in Africa, where
more than 12 million lives have already been lost, American black
leaders are scrambling to call attention to the crisis, and
concluding that they themselves must exercise more vigor and
ingenuity in confronting the epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have been slow to recognize the changing face of AIDS
_ &UR;  &LR; and therefore the changing politics of AIDS,'' says Ron Dellums,
the former California congressman who was a leader in forcing
economic sanctions against the old apartheid regime in South
Africa. Dellums now heads the Washington, D.C.-based Constituency
for Africa, an advocacy group whose mission for the next year, he
says, will be to try and focus American attention on the AIDS
crisis in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   After returning from a recent trip to Africa, Dellums rolled
from pulpit to pulpit across black America, confronting church
leaders. ``I said, `Look folks, 12 million Africans have already
died. You should stand up with moral outrage.' The reaction of
people was, `My God, I had no idea,' '' Dellums says. ``What this
issue has lacked is people prepared to talk loud enough to take it
to a political level.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to those who have already died of AIDS, it is
estimated that upwards of 22 million people are infected with the
HIV virus in sub-Saharan Africa. The crisis has gotten so grave
that in Zimbabwe, one of the most besieged countries, many funeral
homes now keep their doors open 24 hours a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``With ferocious speed, AIDS has wiped out many of the
development gains Africa has achieved over the last two decades,''
said Calisto Madavo, a Zimbabwean who is the World Bank's vice
president for Africa. Speaking at an international conference on
the epidemic held in Zambia last month, Madavo said AIDS was
``killing adults in the prime of their working and parenting lives,
decimating the workforce, fracturing and impoverishing families,
orphaning millions, and shredding the fabric of communities. . . .
It has reduced life expectancy in the most-affected areas and now
threatens businesses and economies.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People,
America's oldest civil rights organization, recently passed a
resolution vowing to pay more attention to the AIDS scourge in
Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``For many years the NAACP didn't do enough about AIDS,''
concedes Julian Bond, chairman of the organization's board of
directors. ``I don't think anyone in the US, the NAACP included, is
doing enough about AIDS in America, let alone Africa.''
</P>
<P>
   That admitted shortcoming, and other we-must-catch-up sentiments
echoed by black leaders, is being seized upon by Eugene Rivers, the
peripatetic Boston minister who has long felt comfortable bumping
heads with old-guard civil rights leaders and their practiced
orthodoxy. Rivers is leading his upstart 21st Century Group into
the heart of the Africa AIDS debate by trying to place the issue at
the top of black America's post-civil rights agenda, and by
assailing many American black leaders as ``exhausted'' or suffering
from a ``crisis of vision.''
</P>
<P>
   Rivers calls 21st Century the ``intellectual arm'' of his
10-Point Coalition, which has long battled crime in Boston's urban
areas. Rivers sees sexual promiscuity in Africa as a form of
violence against women that is mainly to blame for the astonishing
rate of AIDS deaths on the continent. He is planning a series of
nationwide forums to increase public awareness, political advocacy,
and humanitarian assistance, both in America and Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to give the issue of AIDS and sexual behavior the same
level of visibility that a previous generation gave apartheid in
South Africa,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Rivers has also been recruiting some prominent national figures
to his cause, among them Bishop Charles E. Blake of the
18,000-member West Angeles Church of God In Christ.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Africans, based on my observations there, are very
religious people,'' Blake says. ``Many are very responsive to
Christianity. They would be influenced by a message that had
Christian morality attached to it. If Gene saves only 10 people
with his message, that would be great. But I'm sure it will be
greater numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is time for us to link up city to city,'' Blake says of
those congregations wishing to focus attention on AIDS in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Rivers recognizes that his inflammatory charge that many African
men are promiscuous, and his call for abstinence, may win him
unlikely allies among some white conservatives, moralists, and
other so-called Eurocentrics _ thereby alienating his liberal,
civil rights base.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where the argument has merit, it will be addressed,'' he says
of possible criticism. ``When they are obviously partisan, they
will be ignored.''
</P>
<P>
   But seminars, conferences, and resolutions about AIDS are
meaningless, according to Rivers, if the issue of promiscuity isn't
broached.
</P>
<P>
   ``The behavior dimension of this is the third rail,'' Rivers
says. ``That's the one no one wants to touch.''
</P>
<P>
   Bond denies that promiscuity is taboo. ``I've heard people talk
about this,'' he says. ``In a speech I am currently giving, I quote
(W.E.B.) Du Bois talking about `a loss of ancient African
chastity.' I heard Jesse Jackson talk about this. Maybe it's not
talked about enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Eva Thorne, a member of Rivers' 21st Century Group, contends
blacks have long been shy in airing their troubles from within.
``People don't want to talk about when black is ugly,'' Thorne
says. ``They only want to hear about `black is beautiful.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Bond, who has been praised for chairing the NAACP board
following a period of turmoil within the organization, says there
is only so much the NAACP can do when it comes to AIDS and the
issue of promiscuity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is our role to speak of abstinence?'' asks Bond. ``We're not a
birth control organization. That's not our mission.''
</P>
<P>
   Rivers, a minister in the Church of God In Christ, is being
courted by the presidential campaigns of both George W. Bush, the
Texas governor, and Vice President Al Gore. He plans to circumvent
traditional black leaders and appeal to the major political
parties, as well as the Roman Catholic Church, to help him and his
organization address the plight of AIDS sufferers in Africa.

COMPUTERIZED LEG MAKES AMPUTEE'S GAIT EASIER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SYLVIA WOOD  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Mike Tallman finally has a right leg that can
keep up with him.
</P>
<P>
   He lost his real leg 13 years ago on a curvy road in Louisiana
when the motorcycle he was driving hit a patch of sand and flew out
from underneath him. ``I pinched my leg between a culvert and the
motorcycle, and it sheared it off on the spot,'' said Tallman, 36,
who lives in Albany.
</P>
<P>
   Like thousands of other above-the-knee amputees in the United
States, Tallman adjusted to life with an artificial leg. The
problem was his mechanical leg never completely adjusted to him or
those daily spontaneous moments when he needed to stop short,
navigate stairs or keep his balance on an uneven patch of pavement.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were times when I would be walking with my children and
one would suddenly step in front of me,'' he said. ``I would need
to hop-step or stumble to avoid hitting that child. I couldn't just
change my stride.''
</P>
<P>
   Tallman has since become the first person in the United States
to be fitted with a new computerized knee joint that can
practically anticipate his every move. Developed in Germany by Otto
Bock, a company specializing in prosthetic devices, the C-Leg, as
it's called, relies on a microprocessor and sensors to adjust to
changes in Tallman's gait.
</P>
<P>
   The result is an artificial leg that can take Tallman anywhere,
including down steep inclines and stairs _ two particular
challenges for amputees. ``It's almost like having your old leg
back, except you have to put it on every morning,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Approved by the Food and Drug Administration over the summer,
the C-Leg took more than six years of development and costs about
$50,000. The leg, made of the same carbon graphite used to make the
Stealth bomber and powered by a lithium battery, has been available
in Europe and Canada since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a big thing for above-knee amputees,'' said Bill
Sampson of Sampson's Prosthetic &AMP; Orthotic Laboratory in
Schenectady. ``This leg kind of does the thinking for them. It can
kind of know what a patient is going to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Most prosthetic legs require amputees to watch where and how
they step to avoid losing their balance. While almost all
artificial legs use hydraulics similar to the C-Leg, the latest
innovation is a microprocessor to control the leg as it swings and
stands.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is probably the single greatest advancement in
prosthetics in 30 years,'' said Brad Ruhl, director of sales and
marketing for Otto Bock's Minneapolis office, where Tallman
traveled in early September to be fitted with his new leg.
</P>
<P>
   Paddy Rossbach, of the Amputee Coalition of America, is
cautiously optimistic about a leg that could give amputees more
stability and smoother motion. ``I have not actually seen it yet,''
she said from her Long Island office. ``But if it's that good, it
would be wonderful if everyone could have one.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem is cost. Company officials expect the price of the
C-Leg to eventually fall to between $30,000 and $40,000, it is
still two to three times more than current artificial legs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Technology is growing by leaps and bounds, unfortunately
reimbursements are going down,'' Rossbach said.
</P>
<P>
   Tallman, an Army veteran, is still waiting to see whether the
Veterans Administration will cover the cost of his new leg.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's worth every penny,'' he said. ``If I had a choice
between a $40,000 car and this, I'd take the leg.'
</P>
<P>
   An avid skier and outdoorsman before his accident, Tallman is
just as active today. ``I really don't consider myself handicapped
at all until Christmastime, when I use my plates for parking,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Since September, seven people in the United States have been
fitted with C-Legs. Tallman was the first patient because the
company was familiar with the work done by Sampson's Prosthetics.
</P>
<P>
   Owner Sampson has since become one of only two people certified
on the East Coast to fit the C-Leg, which must be programmed for
each individual.
</P>
<P>
   ``The knee joint has given (Tallman) the ability to do more and
think less about it,'' said Sampson, who has no financial interest
in Otto Bock.
</P>
<P>
   With two children and a full-time job, Tallman doesn't miss
worrying. ``It's definitely going to be there for you,'' he said of
the C-Leg. ``It won't buckle out.''

 UNDATED: ... in Africa.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``You cannot advocate for black people in the United States
without understanding the interdependence of black problems
throughout the world,'' Rivers says. ``We're going to be moving
beyond the bifurcation between domestic and foreign.''
</P>
<P>
   For decades, black Americans have had a spiritual connection to
Africa. During the 1960s, stories of Africa's struggles for
independence from the French and British were chronicled endlessly
in the black press. Blacks were proud when their representatives in
Congress _ principally Adam Clayton Powell and Charles Diggs in
those halcyon days of African freedom battles _ presented
themselves at African independence ceremonies. Diggs was known to
drop tears on such occasions.
</P>
<P>
   The 1970s saw an even more impassioned identification with
Africa following the dramatization of Alex Haley's ``Roots'' from
book to television screen, a telling of an African's journey from
his homeland to slavery in America. The 1980s were a rallying cry
to cripple apartheid in South Africa. But it didn't take long,
following the 1990 freeing of Nelson Mandela and his 1994 ascent to
the presidency, for some American blacks to dream of putting a
foothold on the continent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Black Americans felt that economic opportunities were limited
to them in America, Asia, and Europe,'' says Marsha
Coleman-Adebayo, a former senior foreign policy researcher for the
Congressional Black Caucus Foundation, who now heads Ncediwe/Brits,
a Washington D.C.-based group that works with Africans grappling
with the AIDS crisis. ``So they focused their attention on a
continent that might be more open to them and provide more economic
opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, underlying the romance of going back to Africa, of
making money there, a monumental health crisis was looming: AIDS.
But black business interests still continued to push the Clinton
administration for a trade bill with Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would argue that that is extremely shortsighted and
detrimental,'' Coleman-Adebayo says. ``Is that the most important
thing you can do in Africa _ support a trade bill _ when we have
millions dying of AIDS?''
</P>
<P>
   Coleman-Adebayo sees further catastrophe looming. ``We're
looking at the depopulation of Africa as we know it,'' she says.
``It's going to become a continent of orphans, the elderly, war
victims, and the sick. I believe we should look at AIDS in Africa
as a war. And we need a war chest. We need at least $1 billion.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration recently announced a $100 million aid
package to help Africa deal with its AIDS crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's an important step _ but a small step,'' says Dellums,
who plans to encourage other foreign governments to contribute.
``Africa is our heritage, America is our citizenship. As part of
our citizenship, it is our duty to challenge this country to
realize that millions are dying in Africa.''
</P>
<P>
   US Representative Barbara Lee, Democrat of California, has
presented what she is calling a ``Marshall Plan'' to Congress to
help deal with the African AIDS epidemic. The bill, which would
establish an independent agency to help fund research and programs
to combat the crisis, is languishing in the House. Lee has
corralled nearly four dozen sponsors, but realizes there is no hope
the bill will be passed this session. ``But the support is
building,'' Lee says. ``Next year we'll have a jump start.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee doesn't think Rivers' criticism of other black leaders will
help. ``We've got to unify,'' she says. ``This is a whole new state
of emergency. You can't get cynical and you can't bash
organizations that are doing a good job.''
</P>
<P>
   One challenge, black officials acknowledge, will be how to focus
on the AIDS crisis in Africa when black Americans have a major AIDS
problem themselves. Blacks contract 45 percent of new AIDS cases in
the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control. In
the mid-1980s, that number was only 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many blacks who have not done anything in the black community
are now going to help the Africans,'' says Pernessa Seele, founder
of Balm In Gilead, a New York-based group working to develop AIDS
awareness in black churches. ``I am saddened by some of the very
movers and shakers who have jumped on AIDS in Africa and not done
anything about AIDS in our own communities.''
</P>
<P>
   Dellums agrees. ``This AIDS issue is not an `over there' issue
alone,'' he says. ``It's also right here in the 'hood.''
</P>
<P>
   Seele's is one voice not shying from the issue of promiscuity.
She wants blacks to talk more openly about sexual practices in
their own communities. The issue of promiscuity, she says, is not
endemic to Africans only. ``We have some of the same practices here
and we don't talk about them. We don't talk about the brothers who
sleep with four and five women.''
</P>
<P>
   Seele says that the traditional role of missionaries alighting
from American churches for the shores of Africa now must change.
``As our black churches continue to do their missionary work in
Africa, they have to do something other than just spread the word
of God,'' she says. ``They must begin to address the issue of
AIDS.''
</P>
<P>
   Rivers believes that black Americans can position themselves to
save a continent that continues to grip them emotionally and
spiritually.
</P>
<P>
   ``Africa may yet be delivered by those to whom Africa sold into
slavery,'' he says. ``That's the great irony.''

   JOHANNESBURG _ The prospect of a straight-talking minister from
Dorchester prodding African leaders with a new gospel that casual
sex is tantamount to violence meets skepticism from Cape Town to
Kampala.
</P>
<P>
   It is the aim of the Rev. Eugene Rivers to stir the waters
rather than still them. Angered by the ravaging of Africa by AIDS,
he is launching a campaign to shame African governments for doing
and spending too little, and prominent black Americans for watching
in silence as millions of Africans die each year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is time to embarrass the ambassadorial representation of
African countries in Washington,'' Rivers says. ``If they could
mobilize around the issue of apartheid, why don't they do the same
for AIDS?''
</P>
<P>
   The blitzkrieg approach might work on American politicians in
Washington, where confrontation is the norm in politics and the
Clinton administration sympathizes with issues such as the need to
ease Africa's debt burden and break the corporate grip on anti-AIDS
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   But Africans may be harder to influence. As leaders like South
African President Thabo Mbeki promote their vision of an African
renaissance, they are increasingly impatient playing the junior
partner in North-South relations. They reject implicit assumptions
that the West has all the answers for Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Against this backdrop, Rivers raises thorny issues. He argues
that the AIDS epidemic is a symptom of a cultural collapse in
Africa, and wants to make abstinence a human rights issue. But
Africans are traditionally reticent talking about sex. Most find it
difficult to discuss the subject even with their own partners,
studies have shown, let alone outsiders. At a church conference in
Zimbabwe last December, when Rivers first floated the idea that in
the age of AIDS male promiscuity is a form of violence against
women and children, his pleas for open discussion were met with
shocked silence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is dangerous to bring in outsiders to talk about
sexuality,'' says Patricio Rojas, representative of the World
Health Organization in Namibia. ``The field is so complex. If you
talk about changing mores, mores in Boston are very different from
mores in Namibia. We try to promote a strong interchange of
experiences within Africa. That is more useful. Closeness is
fundamental to the success of the message.''
</P>
<P>
   But John Caldwell, an expert on Africa at the Australian
National University in Canberra, has grown impatient with the
light-handed approach. In his latest book on the AIDS epidemic, he
argues that ``government silence is partly explained by the
surprising fact that overseas donor governments have not put
sufficient pressure on political leaders to speak out and do so
continuously, and to organize against the disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been no inducements, such as massive help to the
health system and to programs to curb AIDS given on condition of
sustained and high-profile leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   If donor governments have the clout to attach conditions,
however, smaller players probably don't. Mark Ottenweller, an
American medical doctor who runs 12 AIDS support groups in Soweto
in a partnership between local officials and the US organization
Hope International, says that engaging African leaders often is a
matter of tact and tone. ``Frequently it's out of guilt that they
get involved, as long as you're not too critical,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The same rule applies at the street level. Ottenweller, who
still carries the Bayou accent of his Louisiana upbringing, holds
informal workshops on marriage in his free time. The way to break
through silence, he says, is to establish a sense of common
experience.
</P>
<P>
   A health official in the northern Namibian town of Rundu, where
AIDS is taking a particularly grim toll, agrees. ``If you just walk
in and start talking about sex, you will make people resistant,''
the official says, requesting anonymity. ``People must feel you're
not an outsider. You must use `we' and not `you,' and have an entry
point into the community like a school or a church.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds Bart Cox, director of the AIDS Committee at the Anglican
Diocese in Johannesburg: ``It is the interdependence of people that
matters. Stories of, `Oh, you too?' '' he says. ``We have to create
bonds of compassion through human experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, as the epidemic swells, it is creating an increasing
``compassion burden.'' More people are falling sick and dying, more
families are losing breadwinners, more children are left
parentless. Governments must be held more accountable, AIDS experts
say, but it is also critically important to get new players _
notably churches _ involved in building community-based care
networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the main objectives over the next couple of years is to
bring churches on board,'' says Peter Piot, executive director of
UNAIDS, a joint program of several agencies in the United Nations.
``To be blunt, orphanages will mean tremendous business for
churches.''
</P>
<P>
   The outsider question doesn't deter Rivers, who models his
initiative after the Biblical story of Joseph. Sold into slavery by
his brothers, he later saved them from famine and ruin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until Africans in Africa confront their complicity in the
slave trade, they have no moral standing to challenge blacks in the
US who challenge them regarding the same indifference that they now
express toward the holocaust in Africa today,'' Rivers says.

COUPLE FIGHTS TABOOS ALONG WITH VIRUS

<P>
   LUSAKA, Zambia _ Though physically small, Kabanda Syamalevwe was
once the kind of man who embodied his Tonga tribe's ideals of
masculinity. He ruled his wife and children as lord and master. He
took other women. His peers, he recalls now with laughter, called
him a bull.
</P>
<P>
   But one afternoon in 1993 his world collapsed. A friend walked
into a bar where Syamalevwe was having a few drinks and showed him
a story in the local newspaper revaling that a school teacher had
tested positive for HIV. The woman in the accompanying photo was
his wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine the feeling of helplessness and uselessness,'' he said
during a recent interview.
</P>
<P>
   For most African women, having the AIDS virus is a multiple
curse. It can lead to rejection and violence. Most women contract
HIV from their husbands or boyfriends, but few men willingly accept
responsibility. At the time Brigitte Syamalevwe learned she carried
the AIDS virus, she and Kabanda had been married for 21 years. She
had never strayed. Both knew he was the source of her infection.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of destroying their marriage, however, the personal
crisis of HIV started the Syamalevwes on the kind of long and
fundamental reassessment of their attitudes about sexuality and
marriage that experts increasingly believe is the only true
solution to Africa's AIDS epidemic. It is a process that involves
breaking old molds, elevating the status of women at home and in
society, and redefining what it means to be a man.
</P>
<P>
   ``Men must be confronted with change,'' said Kabanda, a former
health clinic officer. ``Our cultural upbringing has a bearing on
our sexual patterns. So we need to focus on how social expectations
shape our behavior as men and women.''
</P>
<P>
   In the six years since they learned they were infected, Brigitte
and Kabanda, who live in the northern Zambian town of Kitwe, have
tried to understand why men behave the way they do, how women
contribute to that behavior, and how to change. Both are now
involved in community-based HIV/AIDS education. In their spare
time, and with their own resources, they run workshops for men and
women on sexuality and marriage.
</P>
<P>
   They are now in the process of creating Africa's first Society
of Men Against AIDS, a male version of programs in countries like
Senegal that encourage open discussion about behavior and AIDS
among women.
</P>
<P>
   As their story spreads, the Syamalevwes are quickly becoming a
model for how to change sexual dynamics in sub-Saharan Africa.
Responses to the AIDS crisis in the region have tended to focus on
women because they are more vulnerable and also more likely to
attend clinics and obtain information. But that has not slowed the
epidemic, and a consensus is beginning to grow that more emphasis
needs to be placed on male behavior. A study released last month at
an international AIDS conference in Zambia, for example, indicated
that 80 percent of men in that country have multiple sexual
partners.
</P>
<P>
   ``Men are the cutting edge,'' said Salif Sow, an expert on
infectious diseases at Dakar University in Senegal. ``The problem
is that we're always talking about women, but they don't have the
power to protect themselves. Men are the key to HIV transmission.''
</P>
<P>
   At the conference last month in Lusaka, Zambian Health Minister
Nkandu Luo actually suggested that the time had come for African
women to riot against men. But the Syamalevwes have a different
approach: they work with each other to overcome the kind of gender
inequities that have helped AIDS to flourish.
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't always been easy. The paternalistic influences of
Kabanda's Tonga tribe left deep marks on their marriage. His father
had three wives. Men were taught to be physically strong and
emotionally remote. Women were to be weak.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I called him on an issue, he would punish me by coming back
home later than usual,'' Brigitte said. ``It threatened him.''
</P>
<P>
   HIV changed the scenario. Brigitte had herself tested against
Kabanda's wishes, and then did not tell him. She had seen some of
her students struggle with losing their parents to AIDS, and
worried about how her own children would cope in the same
situation. After Kabanda read the story in the newspaper, it took
several months for him to muster the courage to find out his own
status.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with the sudden prospect of shortened lives, the couple
began breaking free from prescribed molds. Kabanda paid less heed
to peer pressure, stopped sleeping around, and took a more active
role in raising the couple's 11 children. He became more supportive
of Brigitte's career and flouted a traditional taboo by having a
vasectomy.
</P>
<P>
   Brigitte also changed. She became more assertive. Whatever
Kabanda expected of her, she held him accountable as well. ``Women
are collaborators in their own servitude,'' she said. ``Pregnant
women are emotionally weakened in the relationship, so I was
Kabanda's slave for a long time. This experience has given me a
chance to get liberated from men, to become an equal partner.''
</P>
<P>
   The Syamalevwes are a rare case. Kabanda was willing to make
changes. Most Africans find it hard to discuss sex openly, and many
women risk violence, blame, and rejection for having HIV. The
couple say they talk about sex and AIDS with their family, but so
far have not insisted that their children be tested for HIV.
</P>
<P>
   In one of their first workshops, in 1994, Brigitte and Kabanda
asked the women to go home that night and ask their men for sex,
knowing that their culture frowns on women who do so. The next day,
23 of the 24 women reported being harassed over the request.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should be appreciated that in our culture, promiscuity is
associated with women,'' Kabanda said. ``It was never in our
vocabulary to say that men were promiscuous. They reject it because
of what the word attaches to their masculinity and superiority.''
</P>
<P>
   A groundbreaking program in Botswana underscores how difficult
it is to change deeply-rooted attitudes. Over the past 18 months,
the Norwegian-funded Men, Sex, and AIDS has run workshops to
encourage men to talk openly about sexuality. Pilot programs
modeled after the project are scheduled to start next month in
Zambia, Zimbabwe, and Swaziland.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of each three-day workshop, most of the men overcome
their initial shyness. But it is too early to tell if the work will
lead to changes in behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``Men are difficult to reach. They don't go to clinics and can't
be bothered to get information,'' said MacDonald Maswabi, the
program's director, in a phone interview from Botswana's capital,
Gabarone. ``So our main concern for now is creating a place where
men can go without being labeled. Many of the men at our workshops
admit they need to change their lifestyle, but it will take a very
long time, assuming we do have an impact.''
</P>
<P>
   The Syamalevwes, however, say that it is often the men who
reject or ridicule their message publicly who come back privately
for help. Many men are afraid to show weakness, they say, and
conform to peer pressure. But what Brigitte tells them is simple:
``You don't lose your manhood through good actions.''

<P>
   In Pakistan Wednesday, there were celebrations on the streets,
and few political tears. Few will lament the end of the era of
Nawaz Sharif, who was ousted as prime minister on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Elected in 1997, he had come to be deeply distrusted by his
compatriots. He was blamed for the state of the economy, whose
foreign debt runs to $32 billion.
</P>
<P>
   He was blamed, too, for the perceived humiliation that Pakistan
suffered in its abortive confrontation with India over the disputed
territory of Kashmir earlier this year. His style was autocratic;
he cracked down sharply on newspapers that dared criticize.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, the military takeover remains more of an almost-coup
than the martial full monty. General Pervez Musharraf responded to
the official announcement of his own arrest by putting his former
boss under house arrest, or, in one of those great official
misnomers, ``protective custody.''
</P>
<P>
   But he has not (yet) dissolved parliament. Nor, unlike previous
generals, who popped up to announce that they were ready to save
the country, has he declared martial law.
</P>
<P>
   It would, however, be disastrous if the world were simply to
shrug at the news of the takeover.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan had a politically dodgy prime minister who was widely
held to be corrupt. But the need for a new prime minister is not
the same as the need for men in uniforms. Generals have ruled
Pakistan for half of its 52 years of independence, rarely to its
advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Churchill's remark that ``democracy is the worst possible
system, except for all the others'' is appropriate. Past experience
suggests that the chances that a general can solve the country's
problems are less than nil.
</P>
<P>
   Only if the military now sets out a timetable for fresh
elections _ which, according to the constitution, must be held
within three months _ is there a chance that things will get back
on track. (As the recent example of Nigeria made clear, generals
can help to lay the groundwork for a transition to democratic rule.
)
</P>
<P>
   The prospects for democracy have considerable knock-on
implications. It is notable that huge and chaotic India has
achieved political stability _ a point reinforced by the reelection
this month of the incumbent prime minister _ accompanied by
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   There is no intrinsic reason why Pakistan, though riven by
ethnic divisions, should not achieve equal stability. If the
generals want to be remembered as patriots, they must accept that
stability cannot be a synonym for suppressing democracy.
</P>
<P>
   This is particularly important, given that the international
tensions in the region remain high.
</P>
<P>
   Both India and Pakistan have carried out nuclear tests in the
last two years; they have so far refused to sign up for the
comprehensive test ban treaty that would end all testing.
</P>
<P>
   If there is a risk of nuclear confrontation, it is here that the
danger is most acute.
</P>
<P>
   Elections sometimes produce bad results. In a democracy,
however, the voters at least have a chance to change their minds
next time. Military rulers cannot so easily be got rid of when
their promises turn sour.
</P>
<P>
   If the generals use the ousting of Nawaz Sharif as an excuse to
stay in power in the longer term, the country's problems will only
go from bad to worse.
</P>
<P>
   The message must be clear: the political and economic freeze-out
will be total, if the military tries to consolidate its long-term
hold on power.
</P>
<P>
   Sharif bad; generals worse. &QL;

<P>
   NEW DELHI _ The first Indians to discover something was badly
wrong in the high, bleak Himalayan mountains above Kargil this
spring were goatherds.
</P>
<P>
   They told Indian soldiers in the valley that there were
Mujahedin up there, Islamic guerrillas, camping on the peaks, deep
inside Indian territory. An Indian army patrol was sent to
investigate: none of them ever came back.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly Indian commanders and their political bosses began to
realize that they were confronting something awesome. This was far
worse than the intermittent artillery shelling from the Pakistani
side of the cease-fire line, the Line of Control (LoC) that had
rained on Kargil for the past three summers.
</P>
<P>
   Enemy forces, taking advantage of India's lack of vigilance, had
penetrated deep into Indian territory; hardened to Himalayan
altitudes, experienced mountaineers, the soldiers had scaled peaks
and ridges along an arc 150 kms (100 miles) long, establishing
bunker-like camps on the most commanding points, with lines of
supply reaching back into Pakistan-administered Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   It was the boldest and most brilliantly executed military
campaign in the history of Indo-Pakistani warfare.
</P>
<P>
   The Mujahedin on the peaks _ most of them actually regular
Pakistani troops in disguise _ stared down at India's National
Highway 1, the ribbon of road that links Delhi with Ladakh, the
highest and remotest region in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Acting as the eyes of the Pakistani artillery stationed beyond
the LoC, they had all the traffic on the road at their mercy.
</P>
<P>
   It took two months of massive effort by up to 60,000 troops,
backed by jet fighters and bombers, for India to begin to win back
the ground it had lost.
</P>
<P>
   The fighting between the world's two newest nuclear powers was
cruel and primitive. The Indian Air Force's aging MiGs strafed and
bombed the Pakistani positions, sometimes using napalm; the Bofors
guns thundered in the valley.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Indian infantry, roped together, hauled themselves up
hundreds of feet of sheer rock, with 50kg (110 lbs) loads on their
backs, many shot like rabbits as they hung there.
</P>
<P>
   They climbed only at night, then hurled themselves at the
Pakistanis as they reached the peaks, throwing grenades, storming
across minefields, finishing the fight man to man with knives.
</P>
<P>
   Every day the Indian commanders told the media back in Delhi of
new successes, new positions captured. But as the casualties
mounted into the hundreds, real success was elusive. Neutral
experts believed it would be nearly impossible to shift the
intruders before winter set in in September.
</P>
<P>
   Only when Pakistani prime minister Nawaz Sharif, under intense
pressure from India and the United States, ordered a withdrawal,
did the fighting stop.
</P>
<P>
   The architect of this Pakistani coup _ 500 men holding back
60,000 for months on end _ was the same man who emerged as
Pakistan's new strongman on Tuesday night: General Pervez
Musharraf, former commando, battle-scarred veteran of earlier
Indo-Pakistani wars.
</P>
<P>
   Both initiatives _ Kargil and the coup d'etat _ bear his
signature: boldness of conception, painstaking planning, ruthless
execution.
</P>
<P>
   But did he act alone? Deposed prime minister Nawaz Sharif's
allies and apologists have been spreading the word, since the
climbdown from Kargil ordered by the prime minister in early July,
that Sharif was out of the loop.
</P>
<P>
   Kargil, they said, was the army's show, and Sharif, the
``statesman'' who signed the Lahore Declaration with Indian prime
minister Atal Behari Vajpayee in February, only endorsed the
operation when it was too far advanced for him to call it off.
</P>
<P>
   For Sharif's admirers, this script has the advantage of making
him look like a man of peace, though also of weakness. It was a
view that the Indian defense minister George Fernandes voiced soon
after the conflict began.
</P>
<P>
   Especially for Indians it was a useful idea to hold on to:
Sharif, the friend of India, betrayed and trapped by his rogue,
fanatically Islamic army.
</P>
<P>
   But army and intelligence sources in Islamabad, as well as
well-placed foreign diplomats there, reject this account. The
informed consensus in Pakistan's capital is that the decision to
mount the Kargil campaign was taken last autumn, soon after General
Musharraf became chief of staff, with Sharif's knowledge and
approval.
</P>
<P>
   The weakness of the plan was that, while tactically brilliant,
strategically it was going nowhere. No defense expert in either
Islamabad or Delhi claims to understand what its strategic
objective might have been.
</P>
<P>
   But Sharif took plenty of decisions during his term as prime
minister _ threatening high profile foreign investors with jail,
for example _ which show just the same mixture of impulsiveness and
myopia.
</P>
<P>
   Sharif is now out of the picture, so his character flaws may
mainly be of interest to historians. General Musharraf, however, is
of more urgent interest, as he now has the fate of 140 million
Pakistanis and the peace of the whole South Asian region in his
hands.
</P>
<P>
   So far we see courage, boldness, decisiveness, but also military
tunnel vision, blindness to larger, non-military realities.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech to the Pakistani people early Wednesday morning,
he showed a keen understanding of where Nawaz Sharif went wrong.
But he has yet to begin demonstrating that he is better equipped to
set things right. &QL;

<P>
   NEW DELHI _ The first Indians to discover something was badly
wrong in the high, bleak Himalayan mountains above Kargil this
spring were goatherds.
</P>
<P>
   They told Indian soldiers in the valley that there were
Mujahedin up there, Islamic guerrillas, camping on the peaks, deep
inside Indian territory. An Indian army patrol was sent to
investigate: none of them ever came back.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly Indian commanders and their political bosses began to
realize that they were confronting something awesome. This was far
worse than the intermittent artillery shelling from the Pakistani
side of the cease-fire line, the Line of Control (LoC) that had
rained on Kargil for the past three summers.
</P>
<P>
   Enemy forces, taking advantage of India's lack of vigilance, had
penetrated deep into Indian territory; hardened to Himalayan
altitudes, experienced mountaineers, the soldiers had scaled peaks
and ridges along an arc 150 kms (100 miles) long, establishing
bunker-like camps on the most commanding points, with lines of
supply reaching back into Pakistan-administered Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   It was the boldest and most brilliantly executed military
campaign in the history of Indo-Pakistani warfare.
</P>
<P>
   The Mujahedin on the peaks _ most of them actually regular
Pakistani troops in disguise _ stared down at India's National
Highway 1, the ribbon of road that links Delhi with Ladakh, the
highest and remotest region in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Acting as the eyes of the Pakistani artillery stationed beyond
the LoC, they had all the traffic on the road at their mercy.
</P>
<P>
   It took two months of massive effort by up to 60,000 troops,
backed by jet fighters and bombers, for India to begin to win back
the ground it had lost.
</P>
<P>
   The fighting between the world's two newest nuclear powers was

IN SCHOOLS DOMINATED BY WOMEN, FEW BECOME SUPERINTENDENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (ATTN: Calif., Ill., Ore., Tenn., Texas, Wash.)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JULIAN GUTHRIE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Although women make up nearly 80 percent of the
nation's teachers, they account for just 10 percent of the
superintendents leading public school systems, virtually the same
percentage as at the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
   The glass ceiling between women and the top job in school
systems is proving one of the most difficult to shatter. In
corporate America, women account for 46 percent of the work force
and hold 40 percent of top management jobs. In the female-dominated
field of education, women hold 35 percent of all management jobs,
from superintendent down to school principal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Society still wants women _ the teachers _ to take care of
children, nurture them and make sure they're safe,'' said C. Cryss
Brunner, a University of Wisconsin professor and author of two
books exploring the role of women superintendents. ``Men are there
to be top administrators who step in and oversee the `school
families.'''
</P>
<P>
   To Brunner, the bias is staggering. Women comprised 10 percent
of superintendents at the dawn of 1900; their ranks dropped to a
mere 1 percent during the 1920s, rose to 3 percent in 1990, and
have reached 10 percent on the eve of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   But to educators such as Lonnie K. Chin, principal at Spring
Valley Elementary School in San Francisco, the bias is far more
personal, and can change a career.
</P>
<P>
   Chin said she once thought of becoming a district
superintendent. She was even recruited into Harvard University's
Urban Superintendents Program. But after seeing the national trend
and frankly assessing her management style, she decided she is
happy being a principal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Superintendents are supposed to charge all over like the Lone
Ranger. My style is more collaborative and cooperative. That's
something that's seen as less decisive,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the superintendents these school districts have hired:
</P>
<P>
   _ Seattle picked retired Army Maj. Gen. John Stanford in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   _ Chicago recently chose former city Budget Director Paul
Vallas.
</P>
<P>
   _ The school board in San Diego this year hired Alan Bersin, a
former U.S. attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Women who have cracked the top job often encounter reactions
they never imagined.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was Chicago's superintendent in the early '80s, I had
reporters asking me who I was dating,'' recalled Ruth Love, a
former superintendent in Oakland, Calif., and in Chicago. ``They
wrote about what I wore or (about) my hair style. There was this
expectation that I, as a woman, would wither up under criticism or
just say, `I'm getting out of here.'''
</P>
<P>
   Yvonne Katz, the first woman to head school districts in
Beaverton, Ore., and San Antonio, had similar experiences.
</P>
<P>
   Now overseeing Beaverton's 32,000 public school children, she
said she hopes younger women will not have to struggle as hard to
be taken seriously.
</P>
<P>
   In schools, just as in business, there are myriad reasons women
have not advanced to the superintendent's office. Some women
teachers put their careers on hold to raise families. Some search
firms aggressively push male candidates for top jobs. But educators
say perhaps the most critical reason is the perception of what type
of personality it takes to manage teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of superintendents who came up through the ranks
were high school principals. And ``in education, people believe
it's OK for women to be elementary school principals, but at high
school and beyond, a man is needed to maintain order and rally the
troops,'' said N. Gerry House, the female superintendent in
Memphis, Tenn., one of the 20 largest districts in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, women account for 35 percent of elementary school
principals and 17 percent of high school principals.
</P>
<P>
   Delaine Eastin, California's first female superintendent of
public instruction, predicts the glass ceiling will break only
after women fill more high school principal jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``At one point, 85 percent of teachers were women and 85 percent
of principals were men. Now, as more women become principals, more
will become superintendents.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Not having more women among the ranks of superintendents is
hurting schools, some educators say.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're looking for leadership in education _ and we are
desperate for strong leaders _ we're eliminating some of our best
candidates,'' said Bob Peterkin, director of Harvard's Urban
Superintendents Program, founded in 1990 to encourage women and
minorities to become superintendents.
</P>
<P>
   San Jose Unified Superintendent Linda Murray said women are
well-suited for the job because: ``It's the women who have an
understanding of what teaching and learning is about. ... You'd
hope that expertise would come through at the highest levels of
leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   For House, the most compelling reason is this: ``In all of our
teaching, we tell kids they can be whatever they want in life and
that gender should not be a discriminating factor. If we aren't
conscious of practicing gender equity, we become a mockery of what
we teach.''

BUSH ATTACK ON CONGRESS SHOWS HE'S LEARNED A LESSON FROM THE PAST 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, Oct. 17)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients) ,
 By ROBERT E. THOMPSON  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In his zeal to escape the stigma of right-wing
negativism, George W. Bush appears to have adopted the slogan of
the anti-Vietnam protesters who rampaged across the land three
decades ago: ``We're going to tell it like it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Appearing to be a graduate of Jesse Ventura's Academy of
Iconoclasm, the affable and often vague Texas governor has attacked
old-guard positions, firing at presumed friends on the right rather
than announced foes on the left. To Bush, that apparently
constitutes telling it ``like it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Such behavior is not characteristic of cautious mainstream
Republicans like Bush. But the governor, who describes himself as a
``compassionate conservative,'' obviously has decided that he must
break out of the confines of myopic conservatism if he is to win
the votes of independents and even Democrats in November 2000.
</P>
<P>
   He is not alone in trying to put a more moderate face on his
party. Arizona Sen. John McCain has been at the task for some time,
and Elizabeth Dole is pursuing a similar course.
</P>
<P>
   But because Bush is the frontrunner, his actions have drawn the
most attention.
</P>
<P>
   Political observers can cite many reasons for his stance. But
one is a lesson he might have learned from his father: Avoid being
weighted down with the pessimism of a right-wing Congress the way
Thomas E. Dewey was in 1948. That lesson remains pertinent today.
</P>
<P>
   Dewey, the New York governor who had defeated Ohio Sen. Robert
A. Taft for the Republican presidential nomination, toured the
country mouthing banalities in his magnificent baritone voice
rather than defining policies that ran counter to those emanating
from Congress.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Harry Truman, seeking a full term in the White
House, barnstormed the nation and, in his plain midwestern twang,
gave what he called the ``do-nothing,'' Republican-controlled 80th
Congress ``hell.''
</P>
<P>
   He also summoned Congress into a special post-convention
session, urging Republicans to act on major domestic issues as
promised in their platform.
</P>
<P>
   But the session ended without congressional action, and Truman
had his campaign issue.
</P>
<P>
   Dewey did nothing to distance himself from the far-right barons
of Capitol Hill. He talked primarily of restoring national unity
and ending waste and inefficiency.
</P>
<P>
   That prompted Truman to assert that Dewey had given the term GOP
``another meaning ... Grand Old Platitude.''
</P>
<P>
   Dewey's cautious generalities and his refusal to stake out
positions independent of a Congress whose actions had antagonized
farmers, organized labor and consumers helped rob him of his life's
ambition to be president of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Pollsters and journalists unanimously predicted his victory over
Truman, but when the ballots were counted, Dewey trailed the
president by more than 2 million popular votes and 114 Electoral
College tallies. (Dixiecrat candidate Strom Thurmond carried four
Southern states with 39 electoral votes).
</P>
<P>
   Bush does not want to get caught in a similar situation. But
Bill Clinton, who is supporting Al Gore for president, is
determined not to let him escape so easily.
</P>
<P>
   Asked his view of Bush's assault on congressional Republicans,
Clinton noted that the governor had supported the GOP's tax cut of
nearly $800 billion, which the president vetoed, plus efforts to
privatize Social Security, dilute the patients' bill of rights and
support the National Rifle Association's opposition to gun control.
</P>
<P>
   The battle, however, is far from over. Gore and Bill Bradley
should understand that if Bush is the GOP presidential nominee next
year, it will be difficult, if not impossible, to tarnish him with
the sins of the current Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Republican orthodoxy dictates that a candidate wrap himself in
right-wing ideology while seeking the presidential nomination and
then move to the center once the party has conferred its major
prize on him.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has defied that maxim. He first distanced himself from
congressional conservatives by taking issue with the House attempt
to delay payments to the poor under the earned income tax credit.
The budget, said Bush, must not ``be balanced on the backs of the
poor.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Bush declared that ``too often, on social issues, my party
has painted an image of America slouching toward Gomorrah. Too
often, my party has focused on the national economy, to the
exclusion of all else, speaking a sterile language of rates and
numbers, of CBO and GNP. Too often, my party has confused the need
for limited government with a disdain for government itself.''
</P>
<P>
   To conservative ideologues, Bush probably sounded like the late
Vice President Nelson Rockefeller, who is almost even with Clinton
on their hate list. One can almost hear them grumbling that George
W. is a replica of his father, President Bush, who is also viewed
with disdain by the right wing.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Texas governor is so far ahead of his Republican
opponents in the public opinion polls, he undoubtedly felt it was
safe and even wise to move now toward the center and away from the
militant right. Conservatives on Capitol Hill are so anxious to win
the White House and so certain that Bush can achieve that goal that
they appear willing to forgive him his outbursts against their
policies.
</P>
<P>
   The governor has taken a gamble, but it appears to be a safe
gamble.

 Undated:... games to play.
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR;
</P>
<P>
   All they needed to do was win one of the final two games, with
two 20-game winners _ Mel Parnell and Kinder _ on the mound and
DiMaggio still weak from pneumonia. ``If we can't win one of two,''
Yawkey mused, ``we don't deserve it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sox had a 4-0 lead on Saturday, with New York starter Allie
Reynolds in the showers early and manager Casey Stengel cursing in
the dugout. They lost, 5-4, when Johnny Lindell, who hadn't hit a
homer since July, ripped one down the left-field line with two out
in the eighth. ``I think we've got 'em,'' Stengel said. ``I can
feel it in my bones.''
</P>
<P>
   Except for a first-inning triple by Phil Rizzuto, which dropped
20 feet from sun-blinded Ted Williams, Kinder shut the Yankees down
on Sunday. But when the Sox couldn't crack Vic Raschi through
seven, McCarthy pulled Kinder for a pinch hitter _ and came up with
nothing. The Yankees nailed Parnell and Tex Hughson for four more
runs, held off Boston in the ninth and went on to beat the Dodgers
in the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   The devastated Sox got drunk on the long train ride home and
Kinder berated McCarthy for lifting him. ``Goddammit, if the old
man had let me bat for myself that day,'' Kinder said later, ``we'd
have won the pennant.''
</P>
<P>
   For a moment in 1951, after the Sox swept the Yankees at Fenway
in early July to move ahead of them, they thought they were on the
way again. ``Hey, looks like we'll be in the World Series this
year, baby,'' clubhouse boy Johnny Orlando taunted DiMaggio, as the
Yankees walked through quietly on their way to the parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Long ways to go, John,'' DiMaggio advised him. ``Don't count
your money. Long ways to go.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees ended up clinching the pennant by sweeping a
doubleheader from Boston at the Stadium, with Reynolds pitching a
no-hitter, and beat the Giants in the Series. The Red Sox ended up
third.
</P>
<P>
   There was no rivalry after that, not for two decades. The
Yankees won 11 of the next 13 pennants. The Sox, a country-club
team playing sandlot ball, sank slowly toward the cellar. In 1965,
when they lost 100 games and played a home game in front of 461
people, they were blanked for three innings by ancient Satchel
Paige, who was 59 going on 65.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Boston rose from the dead with the Impossible Dream
season of 1967, the Yankees were sagging and sullen. After pitcher
Thad Tillotson knocked down Joe Foy, who'd clocked a grand slam a
day earlier, Jim Lonborg plunked Tillotson and both benches
brawled.
</P>
<P>
   That was a prelude to the feuding and febrile '70s, when Athens
and Sparta went at it annually. In 1973, the clubs scrapped after
Munson slammed into Fisk on a suicide squeeze. In 1974, after
blowing a seven-game lead in late August, Boston and New York
helped wipe each other out. The Yankees won two at Fenway in
September; the Sox took a doubleheader at Shea a week from the end,
as Yankee fans littered the diamond with tennis balls and
firecrackers and fought among themselves.
</P>
<P>
   In 1975, Boston took three of four in Fenway to knock New York
out of first place in late June, then shut out the Yankees in both
ends of a doubleheader at Shea Stadium in July to finish them off.
</P>
<P>
   In 1976, the bad blood spilled over in Yankee Stadium in May
when Dwight Evans gunned down Lou Piniella at the plate and
Piniella bowled Fisk, knees against chest. That touched off a
brutal brawl that ended with Mickey Rivers and Graig Nettles
mugging Sox pitcher Bill Lee and dislocating his shoulder _ and
essentially ending Boston's season.
</P>
<P>
   Owner George Steinbrenner and manager Billy Martin were
``Nazis,'' Lee would charge in 1977, when the Yankees overtook the
Sox down the stretch and went to the World Series. Martin sent Lee
a fish and a note: ``Stick this in your purse, you (expletive).''
</P>
<P>
   Martin was gone in 1978 and so, it seemed, were the Yankees, 14
games out in July. Boston was 62-28 and soaring _ until the
All-Star break. By Labor Day, the Sox were unraveling quickly and
the Yankees had won 13 of 15. That set the stage for the ``Boston
Massacre,'' a stunning four-game sweep in the Fens by astounding
scores _ 15-3, 13-2, 7-0, 7-4 _ that threw the clubs into a
first-place tie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what happened,'' muttered dumbstruck Sox skipper
Don Zimmer.
</P>
<P>
   After New York took two of three at the Stadium a week later and
began printing ALCS tickets, Boston was shaken and bewildered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day you sit in front of your locker,'' said shortstop
Rick Burleson, ``and ask God what the hell is going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston needed to win its final eight just to get into a one-game
playoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the way it should be,'' declared Yankee reliever
Sparky Lyle, a Sox refugee.
</P>
<P>
   After six innings, up, 2-0, the home team sensed a pennant in
the breeze. ``RED SOX AHEAD,'' proclaimed the Globe's
late-afternoon edition, which rolled off the presses just as Dent
stepped to the plate with two on and two out.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Torrez, whom Boston had signed away from the Yankees as a
free-agent amulet, watched Dent loft a routine fly to left and
began walking off the mound.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I looked over my shoulder on the way to the dugout and
couldn't believe it,'' Torrez said. ``Yaz is back to the wall,
popping his glove, looking up. I said, `What's this? What the . .
.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Yankees 3, Red Sox 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``Goddamn,'' Torrez said to himself. ``Goddamn, how could that
happen?''
</P>
<P>
   The next thing Boston knew, Yastrzemski was popping to third and
the Yankees were spraying each other with champagne.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 163d game, 5-4, with a man on third and two out in the
ninth,'' Reggie Jackson marveled.
</P>
<P>
   It has been 21 years, but here in Athens, Yaz is still staring
up at the sky, cursed and cursing. The Spartans have won three more
rings since then and Roger Clemens is vowing to win them another.
It is the final October of the 1900s, and destiny has brought the
Yankees and Red Sox together one last time.

 &QL;
<P>
   And so, destiny brings them together again in the final October
of the 1900s, 21 years after Bucky Bleeping Dent's wedge shot found
the screen above The Wall.
</P>
<P>
   They have been intertwined, the Red Sox and Yankees, since they
came down to the final day in 1904 (they were the Pilgrims and
Highlanders then) and Happy Jack Chesbro uncorked a wild pitch to
give Boston the pennant.
</P>
<P>
   When the Sox opened Fenway Park in 1912, they played New York.
When Yankee Stadium opened in 1923, Boston was the visitor. Babe
Ruth hit his first home run against the Yankees. Lou Gehrig hit his
first against the Red Sox. Ted Williams played his first game in
Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   When Roger Maris hit his 61st homer in 1961, Boston's Tracy
Stallard served it up. When Joe Cronin broke his leg and ended his
career, he did it at Yankee Stadium. When Williams spat at the
Fenway fans in 1956, he'd just been booed for muffing Mickey
Mantle's fly ball. When Billy Martin and Reggie Jackson nearly came
to blows in the dugout, it happened at Fenway.
</P>
<P>
   They are Sparta and Athens, these two, the Bronx and the Fens,
pinstripes and carmine hose, World Series rings _ and the Curse of
the Bambino.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox and Yankees are the ``lyric bandbox'' and the House That
Ruth Built, the Splendid Splinter and the Yankee Clipper, Curt
Gowdy and Mel Allen. They are Joe McCarthy pinch-hitting for Ellis
Kinder, Cy Young pitching a no-hitter at 41, Martin and Jimmy
Piersall fighting in the runway, Bill Lee calling the Yankees
``brownshirts,'' Thurman Munson slamming into Carlton Fisk at the
plate, the Boston Massacre, Yaz popping up to third, and Boggsie in
pinstripes, riding a victory horse in the Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox and Yankees are World Series tickets sold in New York
and torn up in Boston, SOLD OUT signs for the big weekends and a
showdown atmosphere even in May. ``It's like the World Series every
day,'' Fisk once said.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox-Yankee rivalry is the stuff of obsession _ at least
on the Boston side. When Tom Yawkey bought the Red Sox in 1933, he
said his only reason was to beat the Yankees. It took him 13 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess we never not talk about the Yankees,'' Fisk once
conceded. `` `What did the Yankees do?' You hear that from the
first spring training game on.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Yankees aren't consumed by what's happening 240 miles
north, it may be because there usually has been relatively little
to be consumed with. Since the day Sox owner Harry Frazee (a New
Yorker, of course) sold them Babe Ruth in 1920, the Yankees have
won 35 pennants and 24 world championships. The Red Sox have won
four and none.
</P>
<P>
   With rare exceptions, whenever the two clubs have gone head to
head _ at the trading table or on the diamond _ the Yankees have
prevailed. Boston sent four Hall of Famers to New York. New York
sent back a few hundred grand and Danny Cater. The Red Sox lost the
1949 pennant to the Yankees on the final day. The Red Sox lost the
1978 pennant to the Yankees on the day after the final day.
</P>
<P>
   The rivalry has been lopsided in New York's favor ever since the
cash-strapped Frazee sold Ruth for $100,000 and a $300,000 loan to
pay off his note on Fenway Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going to be sore as hell at me for what I'm going to
tell you,'' Frazee told Sox manager Ed Barrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going to sell the Big Fellow,'' Barrow guessed. ``I
expected it, Harry. But let me tell you this _ you're going to ruin
yourself and the Red Sox in Boston for a long time to come.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus began the ``Rape of the Red Sox,'' a four-year flesh
auction that sent the core of the ballclub _ pitchers Waite Hoyt,
Joe Bush, Sam Jones, George Pipgras, and Herb Pennock, catcher
Wally Schang, shortstop Everett Scott and third baseman Joe Dugan
to New York for cash and nobodies.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, who hadn't won a thing until they suited up Ruth,
claimed six pennants and three World Series in the next eight
years. The Red Sox, who had won three Series in four years,
finished last in eight of the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``All Frazee wanted was the money,'' said a bitter Harry Hooper,
whom Frazee traded to the White Sox. ``He was short of cash and he
sold the whole team down the river to keep his dirty nose above
water.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees always had the money, which came pouring out of
owner Jacob Ruppert's brewery. But they've also had the knack of
stiffing the Red Sox at both ends of the bargain. In 1923, Boston
traded Pipgras to New York for a backup catcher and cash. Pipgras
went 93-64 in nine seasons for the Yankees, won 24 games in 1928
and was 3-0 in three World Series. After the Red Sox bought him
back a decade later for $100,000, Pipgras went 9-9 in three seasons
and disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   Always, the cosmic joke has been on the Red Sox. They ship a
castoff to New York, he becomes a god. Pitcher Wilcy Moore was 4-10
when Boston sent him back to New York in the middle of the 1932
season. Moore ended up winning the decisive game of the World
Series.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox traded first baseman Babe Dahlgren to the Yankees for
cash. Dahlgren took over for Lou Gehrig and played in the 1939
World Series. Ray Scarborough was 1-5 when Boston sold him to New
York in the middle of the 1952 season. He went 5-1 for New York and
pitched in the Series.
</P>
<P>
   It took the Red Sox nearly two decades to recover from losing
Ruth and the rest. What brought them even, finally, was Yawkey's
cash and Pearl Harbor. When the war was over, the two ballclubs
were nearly back level _ and baseball's most enduring rivalry
developed in earnest.
</P>
<P>
   The 1948 and 1949 seasons set the tone for the passion, the
anxiety, the drama _ and in Boston, the disappointment. (In 1946,
when the Red Sox won their first pennant since 1918, the Yankees
finished 17 games back.)
</P>
<P>
   In 1948, the Red Sox eliminated New York in the next-to-last
game of the season and ended up losing the pennant playoff to
Cleveland when Joe McCarthy bypassed 18-game winner Jack Kramer for
journeyman Denny Galehouse because the wind was blowing toward The
Wall.
</P>
<P>
   In 1949, the Yankees won by beating Boston twice at the Stadium
on the final weekend. For Bostonians, the tease and the torment
began then. After falling 8 1/2 games back in June after Joe
DiMaggio swept them in Fenway all by himself (and got a standing O
from Bostonians), the Sox (who had five .300 hitters) went 59-19
over the second half of the season and climbed into first place
with five games to play.

ZIMMER HAS UNIQUE TAKE ON SOX-YANKEES RIVALRY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHIRA SPRINGER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After taking a foul ball off the side of his head in
Game 1 of the Yankees' Division Series against the Rangers and then
jokingly wearing a combat helmet in Game 2 for protection, the
headaches have returned for Don Zimmer. With Boston and New York
playing in the American League Championship Series, the Yankees
bench coach and former Red Sox manager must deal with a lot of
ticket requests.
</P>
<P>
   Finding seats for family in the New England area will cost more
and cause a little extra aggravation for Zimmer. But such is the
price for switching sides in the Red Sox-Yankees rivalry.
</P>
<P>
   In 1978, Zimmer managed Boston during an up-and-down season that
resulted in a one-game playoff with New York. The Red Sox' season
ended when Bucky Dent belted a three-run homer in the seventh
inning that gave the Yankees a 5-4 victory. For the past four
seasons, the 68-year-old Zimmer has served as bench coach for the
team in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   Celebrating the 50th anniversary of his first season in
professional baseball, Zimmer was the designated expert on
rivalries Tuesday at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The rivalry between the Red Sox and Yankees) is not as big
today as it was in the '70s,'' said Zimmer. ``First of all, there's
a reason. In the '70s, the Yankees had a lineup they put on the
field every day. I had a lineup I put on the field every day.
Everybody gets to know your own players after five or six years.
They're all on the same team. Today, that's not the way. There's no
question that the rivalry has changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were players that hated each other in the '70s. I don't
think that feeling is there today. Bill Lee was hated by the
Yankees. (Carlton) Fisk didn't like (Thurman) Munson and Munson
didn't like Fisk and that's what it was all about in the '70s. I
don't think that feeling is there right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Zimmer remembered that two sections of the left-field bleachers
were empty when the Red Sox journeyed to the Bronx earlier this
season. He could not remember a similar scene in the '70s.
</P>
<P>
   But Zimmer acknowledged that returning to Boston for the ALCS is
special. Whenever he returns to Fenway Park, Zimmer has flashbacks
to his tenure with the Red Sox. And this season, he has kept a
watchful eye on the decisions by Boston manager Jimy Williams, who
is a close friend and once played for Zimmer in the minor leagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spent more years in Boston than any city in the major
leagues,'' said Zimmer. ``I spent seven years there and I loved
every moment of it except a minute and a half.''

A HIGHER LEVEL, EVEN FOR PEDRO MARTINEZ 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Resending for all needed)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A few months ago he was simply being called
baseball's ``dominant pitcher.'' In recent weeks, however, his name
had often been preceded by the words ``shoo-in Cy Young Award
winner.'' But Monday night in Cleveland, Pedro Martinez reached an
even higher level.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez now has a rare athletic aura encircling him. He now has
a mystique about him.
</P>
<P>
   He had popped a few Advil into his mouth Monday night and, two
days after not being able to throw a baseball 40 feet because of a
strained back muscle, he had held baseball's best-hitting team
hitless for six innings. Martinez did not have his fastball, but he
had his heart. And that was enough to lead the Red Sox to a 12-8
victory in the deciding Game 5 of their American League Division
Series against the Indians. It was a rare moment in Boston's
storied baseball history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel good,'' the Mystique Man said in the Yankee Stadium
clubhouse Tuesday. ``I am sure I can work through it. And now I
have more days to rest, I should be OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, he will have four days rest when he takes the mound
Saturday amid what may be the most electric atmosphere inside
Fenway Park in years: Martinez pitching Game 3 of the AL
Championship Series for the Red Sox against Roger Clemens for the
Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Pedro vs. Roger? It may sound like an enticing personal duel to
Boston fans, but not to Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not facing Roger,'' he said. ``Roger is not the one
hitting against me. I'm facing the New York Yankees. That's who I'm
worried about, not Roger. Roger doesn't hit. Roger has to worry
about my teammates, Nomar (Garciaparra), the (Troy) O'Learys, those
guys.''
</P>
<P>
   And then the Mystique Man offered this coup de grace: ``Roger?
Roger is just a pitcher out there.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A significant part of the Martinez mystique is pride. As
pitching coach Joe Kerrigan, teammate Mike Stanley, and other Red
Sox said in the happy mayhem following Monday night's win in
Cleveland, Martinez doesn't just want to be in that situation, he
craves it.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows this better than older brother Ramon Martinez, who
was so worried when Pedro walked to the mound in the fourth inning,
sore back and all, then was so proud after his little brother had
pulled off his marvel of marvels.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he came into the game, I knew he wasn't 100 percent,''
said Ramon. ``I was so nervous.''
</P>
<P>
   When Pedro got through that fourth inning, Ramon rushed over to
his brother.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked him how he feel, and he said he felt fine,'' recalled
Ramon. ``Pedro say, `Everything under control.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Then Ramon asked his little brother how the other part of him
felt _ his emotions, his mind _ when two days earlier he could not
throw a baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ask Pedro how he feel,'' said Ramon, ``and Pedro say,
`Nervous. But everything's under control.' ''
</P>
<P>
   After every inning _ the fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, and
eighth _ Ramon would go over to Pedro.
</P>
<P>
   The question from big brother was always the same: ``Pedro, how
do you feel?''
</P>
<P>
   And despite the little brother's assurances, Ramon could not
relax.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so nervous,'' he said. ``I was in the dugout, but every
time Pedro throw the ball, I was ready to run out to the mound. And
when he come back to the dugout, I'd ask him again.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramon acknowledged that at least part of the reason he kept
asking the same question was simply to say something, to say
anything to relieve the twin pressures of the Red Sox absolutely
needing to win the game and his brother risking an aggravation of
his back injury. But, really, Ramon never had to ask Pedro a thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know my brother, I know him so well,'' said Ramon. ``I could
see in his eyes. I look in Pedro's eyes and I see the fire. I could
see from his eyes he was fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramon had seen the fire as early as Sunday night, when no one
else knew that Pedro would be ready to pitch Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ask him after the (fourth) game and Pedro tell me, `I'm
going to be there,' '' said Ramon. ``And I told Pedro that all of
us were going to be there for him. He was happy to hear that. And
that was it.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yankees manager Joe Torre agrees that Martinez has the Mystique:
``There is no question that aside from all the physical things that
Pedro brings to the table, he has got that psychological edge of
what he has accomplished this year. There is no question. We will
go out there and hopefully be able to match him.''
</P>
<P>
   Torre will hope to match Martinez on Saturday by sending out
Clemens, which ``will be a lot of fun,'' said the manager.
``Obviously, what Roger has meant to that organization and that
ballpark for a number of years and, of course, what Pedro has done
this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, what Martinez did Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   In the second inning, Martinez went over to Kerrigan and manager
Jimy Williams ``and he just wanted to assure us he was OK,'' said
Kerrigan. ``I was as surprised as anybody else. We had formulated
our game plan before the game, and all we were thinking was maybe
Pedro could give us an inning at the end of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   By the third inning, though, the score was 8-8, and Martinez had
seen enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just wanted to settle the game down,'' said Kerrigan. ``We
just wanted to bring some normalcy to the game. It was looking like
one of those backyard softball games.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerrigan was amazed by what he saw. Instead of Martinez giving
his all for an inning or two, said the pitching coach, ``I saw him
getting looser and then he got stronger as he went on.''
</P>
<P>
   And each inning, when Martinez stepped out of the dugout, said
the pitching coach, ``I was watching Pedro when he got back to the
mound and watched him throw his warmup pitches and I was looking
for any stiffness. I was just watching for him tightening up.''
</P>
<P>
   Kerrigan was expecting Martinez to throw maybe 40 pitches.
Instead, the ace went out inning after inning, six of them in all,
throwing a total of 97 pitches. Kerrigan could only marvel at what
he saw.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's Pedro,'' he said. ``That's the legend of Pedro.''
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, in the outfield at Fenway Park, Martinez could toss
the ball only a few times before having to call it quits.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's when I thought Pedro had no chance of pitching,'' said
Kerrigan. ``No chance. He and I threw only four or five balls, only
at a distance of 40 or 50 feet, and Pedro told me, `No, I can't do
it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, in the gloom and mist and drizzle of late afternoon
in Fenway, Martinez was encouraged by being able to toss the ball _
tossing it only moderately, mind you _ for all of eight minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``But Pedro was still a little fatigued depite playing catch in
the outfield for only eight minutes,'' said Kerrigan. ``That was on
my mind. The fatigue.''
</P>
<P>
   Early Tuesday morning, in the mayhem of the Red Sox clubhouse in
Cleveland, as Kerrigan looked on as Pedro and Ramon Martinez hooked
arms and danced to a salsa beat, the pitching coach was nearly
speechless when asked to put Martinez's performance into context.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know . . . geez,'' said Kerrigan. ``It was one of the
most heroic, gutsy performance you've ever seen. I mean, Pedro was
so alive. I mean, Pedro brought so much life to our bench. I mean,
he'd come in between innings and he was nothing but a chatterbox,
bringing our offensive people along with him. He was real loose, he
was chattering away, he was having fun out there. He loves that
situation. He lives for it.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Martinez said he had never before felt what he felt when the Red
Sox carried him off the Jacobs Field mound on their shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just a great, great feeling,'' he said. ``It was my
first time I experienced something like that and, you know, you
pretty much have to live it to understand it.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez is hoping to keep the feeling going. It's all about
winning, whether in this historic Red Sox-Yankees rivalry or any
other series.
</P>
<P>
   ``My rivalry is really against any team,'' said Martinez.
``That's my personal rivalry. I'm going to feel about the Yankees
the way I feel about any team. I don't have anything against any
team; I don't have anything against Roger. I respect Roger just as
Roger has to respect our team.''
</P>
<P>
   So, concluded Martinez, ``I'm just going to go out there and
play the way I know how to play and forget about the at Babe
Ruth was traded in 19 . . . I guess, 18? Or sold. Or whatever. And
just go out there and play my game.''

   MONTREAL _ Clover is OK, ditto for Buttercup. But Suzie or Elsie
are definite no-nos.
</P>
<P>
   Daisy is borderline, and would probably require executive
approval before it could be bestowed on a cow _ at least on a cow
at Canada's Central Experimental Farm, a federal agricultural
museum and research center in Ottawa.
</P>
<P>
   It's a matter of bovine correctness coming to the barnyard.
</P>
<P>
   Instituting a policy that has raised bellows of derision on
farms across the land, bureaucrats have ordered the center to cease
the custom of giving ``human female names'' to cows because such
names might give offense to women.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people are ... sensitive to finding their name on an
animal. I am, for example,'' Genevieve Ste-Marie, director of the
National Museum of Science and Technology, which oversees the farm,
told the Ottawa Citizen. ``Let's say you came in and found your
name on a cow, and you thought the cow was old and ugly.''
</P>
<P>
   Ste-Marie is responsible for the directive banning feminine
names for dairy cows. Instead, new cows at the government facility
must be provided only ``non-people names,'' such as Red-Leg or
Rhubarb.
</P>
<P>
   ``Animals should have their own names,'' said Ste-Marie.
</P>
<P>
   So Maple is fine, but Mabel is forbidden. Bossy gets the nod,
but not Bessie. Names unusual for women but not unheard of _ Skye
or Jewel, say _ will get the nay or yea on a cow-by-cow basis.
</P>
<P>
   According to officials, the change was instituted after a woman
visiting the research farm was insulted to discover she shared her
name with a cow.
</P>
<P>
   ``There had been a complaint raised that a cow was called
Stephani,'' said Michelle Dondo-Tardiff, director of the farm's
Agriculture Museum. ``It was a verbal complaint from somebody named
Stephani.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, at least, Ariel, Becky, Lucy, Meg, Rosella, Veronica,
and the other 45 milk cows at the center _ even the offending
Stephani _ can continue chewing their cuds in contentment. The
original plan to change existing names was deemed impractical. And
the names of Dapple, Ghost, and Jello were safe from the start.
</P>
<P>
   Cows aren't the only critters under scrutiny. The rule will be
applied to sheep, pigs, horses, and other animals at the facility,
which is a popular destination for school tours and family outings.
</P>
<P>
   Male names may also be consigned to the dust heap of Canadian
farm history: No more Tom Turkey, no more Gilbert Goose, and,
presumably, no more pigs called Wilbur, as in E.B. White's classic,
``Charlotte's Web.''
</P>
<P>
   The move to squash sexism on the farm has touched off a
cavalcade of calls to radio talk shows and letters to newspapers.
Most citizens seem more appalled than amused.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cows are wonderful animals and give us perfect food: milk,''
wrote Mildred Beechey of Ottawa. ``I'm proud to have `Millie the
cow' in the barn at the center. . . . My advice to this woman is to
change her name and leave the cows alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Although there are no hard rules for naming ordinary milk cows
on private farms, most are given female names _ although non-human
monikers are common.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a `Spiffy' and we've got a `Straw,' which aren't
girl names,'' said Angela Hamelin, who runs a dairy farm near
Kingston, Ontario. ``But usually we just give them female names _
`Donna,' `Debbie,' whatever. And yes, one of ours is called
`Angie.' Why would I mind? Cows are sweet and productive animals.''
</P>
<P>
   Registered cows _ that is, cows of pure stock, such as
Holsteins, Swiss, or Jerseys, whose bloodlines can be traced for
generations _ receive three names for record-keeping: the name of
the farm, the name of the sire, and the cow's ``personal'' name,
plus a number designating the cow's matriarchal line.
</P>
<P>
   Male cattle seldom get names because most are herded off to the
slaughterhouse before reaching maturity. There isn't a lot of use
for bulls down on the modern farm; almost all dairy cows are
impregnated by artificial insemination these days.
</P>
<P>
   The fuss over cow names has spawned a spate of humorous
complaints from people whose names might be associated with farm
creatures.
</P>
<P>
   ``How would you like to be named Bill?'' demanded Bill Steele of
Nepean, Ontario, in a letter to the Ottawa Citizen. ``How about
having a duck's nose named after you? That cuts me to the quick
every time I hear it.''

 &HT;    COURT TO RULE ON ALLOWING FEDERAL SUITS ON STATE WORKER AGE BIAS
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A skeptical Supreme Court took up the question
Wednesday of whether states can be sued by their employees in
federal court for age discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   During oral arguments involving a trio of age discrimination
cases filed against state agencies _ including the Florida Board of
Regents, the Florida Department of Corrections and a state
university in Alabama _ the justices seemed reluctant to uphold a
1974 provision of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act that
extended its reach to the states.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is whether Congress exceeded its authority when it said
age discrimination cases against state agencies could be heard in
federal courts. Normally, states have immunity from federal
lawsuits under the 11th Amendment to the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   A 1996 case involving the Seminole Indian tribe of Florida
restricted Congress's ability to override the 11th Amendment in a
law unless the lawmakers stated they specifically intended to do
so.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor noted that the 1974 discrimination
act never mentioned that Congress was abrogating the 11th
Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   But Jerome Collins, an attorney representing 36 faculty members
at Florida State University and Florida International University
and a state Corrections Department employee who alleged age
discrimination, said Congress had the power to override the 11th
Amendment because it specifically determined that false stereotypes
regarding age were being used by government agencies to
discriminate against the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Sutton, representing the Board of Regents, argued that
Congress overstepped its bounds in usurping the amendment.
</P>
<P>
   ``States are saying with respect to our own employees, we are
responsible for regulating them and making sure there is no
discrimination,'' Sutton told reporters after the hearing, noting
that ``the federal government doesn't allow states to bring suits
against it in state courts.''
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for the elderly worried that the Supreme Court would
continue a recent pattern of siding with states rather than
Congress in assessing state immunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we get an unfavorable decision, ... then millions of state
employees are left without any federal protection from age
discrimination,'' said Laurie McCann, staff attorney for AARP, the
nation's largest organization of older Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Although most states have laws against age discrimination, their
quality and enforceability vary widely, McCann said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some are just words on paper. Depending on what state you live
in, you may or may not have effective protection from age
discrimination,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The court did not indicate when it would rule in the case, known
as J. Daniel Kimel Jr. et. al. v. Florida Board of Regents et. al.

SCIENTISTS EXPLORE DEPTHS OF RESERVOIR'S HISTORY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT ALLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   QUABBIN RESERVOIR _ The first visitors to the village of
Greenwich in 60 years wore diving gear, drifting down through
Boston's drinking water to reach the only paved road in town. For a
few surreal minutes, they returned to Depression-era America before
the rising water of the Quabbin Reservoir drowned the entire valley
and erased Greenwich from the map.
</P>
<P>
   After decades of reluctance to let researchers swim in a public
water supply, the Metropolitan District Commission is letting
divers explore the bottom of this reservoir, an engineering marvel
that cost 2,500 people their homes.
</P>
<P>
   In their first season of research, divers from the University of
Massachusetts already have discovered that Quabbin's builders
didn't remove everything before the flood. Empty graves, stone
walls, and cellar holes all rest beneath a layer of silt along with
the residue of everyday 1930s life such as glass milk bottles and
rusty buckets.
</P>
<P>
   And, in place of people, rare animals have moved in, including a
tiny worm with tentacles on its head that is believed to live
nowhere else in New England. Without intending to, say the
researchers, the builders of the Quabbin Reservoir may have created
a deepwater lake more like those of New England 10,000 years ago
than lakes of today.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real goal is to find out what's living down there, since
no one has ever investigated,'' said Ed Klekowski, the University
of Massachusetts at Amherst biologist who organized the research
group. ``It was like a big, wet black box in Western Massachusetts,
and Boston was drinking it.''
</P>
<P>
   But in looking for life, the researchers are coming face to face
with the death of four towns _ Prescott, Enfield, Dana, and
Greenwich _ whose loss is still mourned weekly by former residents
who gather for Tuesday tea at Quabbin headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes an impact on your mind doing this,'' admitted
Klekowski, who plans to write a book about the experience. ``The
most poignant thing you see is the shrubs planted around
gravestones. Somebody planted this bush, probably a lilac, and here
it is underwater.''
</P>
<P>
   The researchers initially feared their work would be seen as
desecration by former Swift River Valley residents, but, if
anything, many of them are intrigued at the hope of glimpsing, even
on videotape, their long-lost communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``My only regret is I wish I was with them,'' said Harrison
Thresher Jr., 85, who grew up in Greenwich, a stone's throw from
where the divers explored last week.
</P>
<P>
   Thresher, the son of Greenwich's mail carrier, recognized the
exact spot where Klekowski's team dove last week, on old Route 21
in front of a hotel that had burned down. Now under 54 feet of
water, all that remains is the elegantly cut stone wall and a
hitching post with a rusted ring at the top.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its sad birth, the creation of the Quabbin Reservoir
stands as one of the Commonwealth's greatest engineering
accomplishments, providing the Boston metropolitan area with one of
the most abundant and purest water supplies in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   After years of study, but remarkably little attention to valley
concerns, the old Metropolitan Commission methodically dismantled
the towns, buying out residents, cutting down trees, and relocating
7,500 graves to empty the land. Then, a dam built on top of
Greenwich re-routed the Swift River so that it slowly flooded the
valley, which was plugged at the southern end by the massive Winsor
Dam.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, the engineers created a water body quite different
from those around it. University of Massachusetts biologist Douglas
Smith said the lake resembles the waters of southern New England
2,000 years after the last ice age ended, before human pollutants,
organic matter, and sediment had time to build up.
</P>
<P>
   Almost no plants grow in the Quabbin, and its clarity is
unparallelled, allowing divers to see up to 60 feet.
</P>
<P>
   However, since the Quabbin is only 60 years old, Smith doubted
that Klekowski and graduate student Sean Werle would find anything
unusual when they began diving, along with state troopers, two
months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``My assumption was that they would get whatever the Swift River
carried,'' said Smith. ``I've been pleasantly surprised all
along.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, the divers have found three rare species, including a
worm called a freshwater polychaete that hasn't been found
elsewhere in New England. The fingernail-sized specimen is a
relative of Caribbean worms that use tentacles on their heads to
catch food. In addition, they have found a sponge that grows in
deep, clear water, as well as a mussel that is more typical in
streams, which tend to be cleaner than standing water.
</P>
<P>
   Smith suspects that these creatures probably lived in the
streams and ponds of the valley, and they prospered in the
artificially clean water of the Quabbin, even as they disappear
from other parts of New England where human runoff is changing the
water chemistry.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great big experiment from a biological point of
view,'' said Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, for the biologists, the human stories beneath the Quabbin
are at least as compelling as the rare animals. Thresher, for
example, was born over the general store and post office in
Greenwich, where the divers explored last week, and his father
refused to leave even as the whole town was torn down around him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very determined to stay to the last minute. He carried
the mail there 30 years. His grandparents and forefathers had lived
there for many years,'' recalled Thresher.
</P>
<P>
   And Klekowski's journal describes the eerie feeling of wandering
in dead towns, especially in the old cemeteries where demolition
crews left pieces of gravestones and other stonework behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``An opening appeared under me . . . filled with rotting leaves,
covered with a gray veil of water mold. I started to remove leaves
. . . when my fin slipped into the hole,'' he writes. ``The sides
were lined with brick, the hole was six feet long and shoulder
wide: it was a grave and I had one foot in it 50 feet underwater!''
</P>
<P>
   After 30 dives, Klekowski's team is finished for the season, but
he doesn't feel the research is nearly done, and he hopes the MDC
will give them permission to dive next year. At 30 minutes per
dive, the divers say they're leaving just as they are making
interesting discoveries.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're just down there long enough for a snippet. There's a
whole photographic essay to be had down there,'' said Klekowski.

   You go abroad, you make a list, and don't forget the medical
supplies:
</P>
<P>
   Ace bandages, check; hypodermic needles, check; blood pressure
cuffs, check; toothbrushes by the hundreds, check; toothpaste,
natch, and combs, soap, shampoo, check; soccer balls _ soccer
balls? _ check. That's what the little Honduran kids kick around
while they're waiting for the medical team from Boston to treat
them or their families. So, soccer balls, check. Toyota Land
Cruiser? Alas, no Land Cruiser.
</P>
<P>
   When the 14 volunteers from Brigham and Women's Hospital in
Boston and Partners in Health assemble in Honduras Saturday, their
trek into the muddy hills of the countryside will commence in
borrowed or rented vehicles. Doctors, med students, nurses,
dentists, and dental assistants _ all are taking vacation time,
volunteering to serve some of the hemisphere's poorest peasants,
and paying $950 each for the privilege plus the cost of their plane
tickets.

   This is the eighth year for the Medical Mission, and this year
there will be eight week-long brigades that staff traveling clinics
in the mountainous Yeguare Region, where 50,000 people eke out a
precarious existence scraping food out of water-starved terrain.
Too much water was the problem in Honduras, which was devastated by
40 inches of rain dumped by Hurricane Mitch last year. That
destroyed roads, bridges, crops, and water supplies in a country
that didn't have enough to begin with.
</P>
<P>
   The Yanks bring their supplies with them. ``They have no
supplies,'' says Linda Jo Stern, who directs the Brigham's Southern
Jamaica Plain Health Center out of a neat, new $5 million building
on Centre Street in Boston. ``Even before Mitch, these people had
nothing.'' Now there's even less.
</P>
<P>
   Stern, a cheerful self-styled '60s radical who was once arrested
in her Wisconsin student days for antiwar protesting, has mellowed
some. Married to a music industry executive and mother to a UMass
student, she planned on legging her way through the Tufts 10K road
race Monday before flying to Tegucigalpa to set up for the brigade
scheme. Stern and Dr. Helen Burstin of the Brigham's Upham's Corner
Health Center created the medical missionary organization from
scratch.
</P>
<P>
   ``We complement the Honduran medical services. We keep in mind
`hands, heart, head.' It's not just `gringos getting on an
airplane.' '' The needs are complex and interwoven: ``health,
nutrition, water, sanitation, and education.''
</P>
<P>
   Stern is a veteran of community and activist networks. She once
ran a food co-op and claims some mechanical training: ``I can fix a
car. I can drive anything. I guess you could say I'm a woman of
many spare parts.'' What she really craves is a new Land Cruiser
for the rugged backcountry the brigades must negotiate to go where
the patients are. ``They're really sturdy, have high axles. We'd
want a bright color, so they could see us coming from far off, no
browns or greens, you don't want to blend in.''
</P>
<P>
   When they settle in at their base camp in Zamorano College, this
month's brigade will include Stern, a Needham resident; Dr.
Burstin, an internist and team leader; Dr. Steve Lacy of the
Cambridge (Mass.) Health Alliance and his wife, Ricki, a nurse at
Cambridge City Hospital; Dr. Jennifer Kasper, a Jamaica Plain
pediatrician with experience in Nicaragua and El Salvador; dental
hygienist Carrie Thibault of Brookline, Mass.; dentist Tom Derosier
of Falmouth, Mass.; dentist Arthur Hannigan of Falmouth and his
wife, Leslie, a dental assistant; Sandy MacPherson, a nurse-midwife
from Reading, Mass.; Dr. Diane Brockmeyer of Roslindale, Mass.; Dr.
Emily Oken of Brookline; Dr. Gitta Rohweder of Hingham, Mass; and
two Honduran medical students, Mauricio Orellana and Jairo Valle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are the kinds of people who like to go on these trips,''
Stern said proudly after listing her crew. She also tossed in a
bouquet for American Airlines. ``They do a fantastic job for us.
You see all those supplies in cartons down in the basement? They
crate those up and ship them for us. Todd Smith of American, he
should get a medal.''
</P>
<P>
   But nobody's doing it for medals or recognition. You give up a
week's vacation, you get your shots, you get to Logan with your
bag, and you drive for hours over bumpy mountain tracks, and when
you arrive, you give shots, set fractures, yank teeth, counsel
mothers, inoculate babies, commiserate with those beyond help, and
generally leave Honduras a little better off for your efforts. And
did I forget you pay a grand for the privilege? Because it is a
privilege to put your skills and succor in the service of your
fellow man, woman, and child, is it not?
</P>
<P>
   With or without a Land Cruiser, they do what they can.

FROM NEW MEXICO'S GOVERNOR, RARE CANDOR ON DRUGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   New Mexico governor Gary Johnson drew back the drapes, opened
the door, and invited us to enter the safe suburban world of drugs.
``I hate to say it, but the majority of people who use drugs use
them responsibly,'' Johnson said last week at a drug policy
conference in Washington. ``They choose when to do it. They do them
at home. It's not a financial burden.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson never referred to the suburbs, peopled mostly with
middle-class and wealthy white Americans. Nor did he invite an
explosive comparison between the burbs and inner cities of
low-income African-Americans and Latinos. All Johnson thought he
was doing was calling for national drug legalization.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the amount of money we're putting into the war on drugs, I
suggest it's an absolute failure,'' Johnson said. ``Make drugs a
controlled substance like alcohol. Legalize it, control it,
regulate it, tax it. If you legalize it, we might actually have a
healthier society.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was reflexively attacked by the feckless leaders of the
drug war. Drug czar Barry McCaffrey said that Johnson ``has done
more damage in the last few months than has been done in the last
several years by drug legalization forces.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of scolding Johnson, we should appreciate his candor.
Johnson told the truth on America. In the inner city, we have
declared drugs to be an insidious tumor, so malignant that we have
imprisoned tens of thousands of nonviolent users. For the children
of privilege, dope is a benign indiscretion.
</P>
<P>
   Drugs are a ``curiosity,'' as multi-million dollar CBS News
anchor Dan Rather has explained about his use of ``everything,''
including heroin. Drugs are, as President Clinton and former US
Representative Susan Molinari have said about marijuana, an
``experiment.'' If the Democrats keep the White House in 2000, we
will have another president who has smoked dope. Both Bill Bradley
and Vice President Al Gore said they used marijuana as young
adults. Gore said, ``it was looked at similar to the way moonshine
was looked at during Prohibition.''
</P>
<P>
   Reducing drug use to a high school chemistry experiment is fine
for the privileged, and certainly no excuse, in their minds, to
block them from the highest offices in the land. Yet, the
Gore-Clinton White House, Molinari's vengeful Republicans,
Bradley's cowering Democrats, and Rather's news executives made
drug use for low-income African-American and Latinos a crime for
the dungeons.
</P>
<P>
   Though 76 percent of illegal drugs are consumed by white
Americans, and 14 percent are consumed by African-Americans, nearly
matching their share of the US population, African-Americans make
up 35 percent of the arrests, 55 percent of drug convictions, and
74 percent of all sentences for illegal drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Even though white Americans and African-Americans use illegal
drugs equally, African-American men went to jail for drugs at more
than double the rate of white American men from 1985-1995. The
number of juveniles of color jailed for drug offenses went up by 78
percent while the number of white youth dropped 34 percent.
African-American juvenile drug cases are four times as likely to be
transferred to adult court than white juvenile drug cases.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, the 46-year-old triathlete said, ``I was somebody who
smoked marijuana in college. I didn't experiment with marijuana, I
smoked it. I made a bad choice, but even then, it wasn't a choice
that I felt should have landed me in jail.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet no one seems to have the political will to reverse the
politics that land African-Americans and Latinos in jail for bad
choices. The best example is crack cocaine. In the late 1980s a
hysterical Congress made made crack possession such a deadly sin
that a person with 5 grams of crack received the same punishment as
one who was nailed with 500 grams of powder cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton-Gore administration, fearful of being seen as soft
on crime, has allowed the 100-to-1 crack-to-power ratio persist
even though the pharmacology of crack cocaine is little or no
different from powder. Even though the drug was stereotyped by
politicians and the media as a black inner-city drug, 65 percent of
its users are actually white, according to the US Sentencing
Commission. But only 5 percent of those convicted for crack
offenses were white, while 93 percent of crack convictions were
meted out to African-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was right to keep legalization a topic for open debate.
``We really need to put all options on the table,'' he said. Of
course, putting all options on the table means an open discussion
about the racism of the drug war.
</P>
<P>
   It may be debatable whether people can use pot, coke, and heroin
``responsibly.'' What is not debatable is who pays the
consequences. The suburbs smoke dope and snort coke behind fences,
drapes, and doors at no visible financial burden. Meanwhile,
mothers in the inner city have to scrimp for change to get on a bus
to go see their sons and daughters who were snatched off corners by
the police and put in prison. For them, it is no experiment.
Curiosity killed the cat.

 &QL;
<P>
   QUABBIN RESERVOIR _ The first visitors to the village of
Greenwich in 60 years wore diving gear, drifting down through
Boston's drinking water to reach the only paved road in town. For a
few surreal minutes, they returned to Depression-era America before
the rising water of the Quabbin Reservoir drowned the entire valley
and erased Greenwich from the map.
</P>
<P>
   After decades of reluctance to let researchers swim in a public
water supply, the Metropolitan District Commission is letting
divers explore the bottom of this reservoir, an engineering marvel
that cost 2,500 people their homes.
</P>
<P>
   In their first season of research, divers from the University of
Massachusetts already have discovered that Quabbin's builders
didn't remove everything before the flood. Empty graves, stone
walls, and cellar holes all rest beneath a layer of silt along with
the residue of everyday 1930s life such as glass milk bottles and
rusty buckets.
</P>
<P>
   And, in place of people, rare animals have moved in, including a
tiny worm with tentacles on its head that is believed to live
nowhere else in New England. Without intending to, say the
researchers, the builders of the Quabbin Reservoir may have created
a deepwater lake more like those of New England 10,000 years ago
than lakes of today.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real goal is to find out what's living down there, since
no one has ever investigated,'' said Ed Klekowski, the University
of Massachusetts at Amherst biologist who organized the research
group. ``It was like a big, wet black box in Western Massachusetts,
and Boston was drinking it.''
</P>
<P>
   But in looking for life, the researchers are coming face to face
with the death of four towns _ Prescott, Enfield, Dana, and
Greenwich _ whose loss is still mourned weekly by former residents
who gather for Tuesday tea at Quabbin headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes an impact on your mind doing this,'' admitted
Klekowski, who plans to write a book about the experience. ``The
most poignant thing you see is the shrubs planted around
gravestones. Somebody planted this bush, probably a lilac, and here
it is underwater.''
</P>
<P>
   The researchers initially feared their work would be seen as
desecration by former Swift River Valley residents, but, if
anything, many of them are intrigued at the hope of glimpsing, even
on videotape, their long-lost communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``My only regret is I wish I was with them,'' said Harrison
Thresher Jr., 85, who grew up in Greenwich, a stone's throw from
where the divers explored last week.
</P>
<P>
   Thresher, the son of Greenwich's mail carrier, recognized the
exact spot where Klekowski's team dove last week, on old Route 21
in front of a hotel that had burned down. Now under 54 feet of
water, all that remains is the elegantly cut stone wall and a
hitching post with a rusted ring at the top.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its sad birth, the creation of the Quabbin Reservoir
stands as one of the Commonwealth's greatest engineering
accomplishments, providing the Boston metropolitan area with one of
the most abundant and purest water supplies in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   After years of study, but remarkably little attention to valley
concerns, the old Metropolitan Commission methodically dismantled
the towns, buying out residents, cutting down trees, and relocating
7,500 graves to empty the land. Then, a dam built on top of
Greenwich re-routed the Swift River so that it slowly flooded the
valley, which was plugged at the southern end by the massive Winsor
Dam.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, the engineers created a water body quite different
from those around it. University of Massachusetts biologist Douglas
Smith said the lake resembles the waters of southern New England
2,000 years after the last ice age ended, before human pollutants,
organic matter, and sediment had time to build up.
</P>
<P>
   Almost no plants grow in the Quabbin, and its clarity is
unparallelled, allowing divers to see up to 60 feet.
</P>
<P>
   However, since the Quabbin is only 60 years old, Smith doubted
that Klekowski and graduate student Sean Werle would find anything
unusual when they began diving, along with state troopers, two
months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``My assumption was that they would get whatever the Swift River
carried,'' said Smith. ``I've been pleasantly surprised all
along.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, the divers have found three rare species, including a
worm called a freshwater polychaete that hasn't been found
elsewhere in New England. The fingernail-sized specimen is a
relative of Caribbean worms that use tentacles on their heads to
catch food. In addition, they have found a sponge that grows in
deep, clear water, as well as a mussel that is more typical in
streams, which tend to be cleaner than standing water.
</P>
<P>
   Smith suspects that these creatures probably lived in the
streams and ponds of the valley, and they prospered in the
artificially clean water of the Quabbin, even as they disappear
from other parts of New England where human runoff is changing the
water chemistry.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great big experiment from a biological point of
view,'' said Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, for the biologists, the human stories beneath the Quabbin
are at least as compelling as the rare animals. Thresher, for
example, was born over the general store and post office in
Greenwich, where the divers explored last week, and his father
refused to leave even as the whole town was torn down around him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very determined to stay to the last minute. He carried
the mail there 30 years. His grandparents and forefathers had lived
there for many years,'' recalled Thresher.
</P>
<P>
   And Klekowski's journal describes the eerie feeling of wandering
in dead towns, especially in the old cemeteries where demolition
crews left pieces of gravestones and other stonework behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``An opening appeared under me . . . filled with rotting leaves,
covered with a gray veil of water mold. I started to remove leaves
. . . when my fin slipped into the hole,'' he writes. ``The sides
were lined with brick, the hole was six feet long and shoulder
wide: it was a grave and I had one foot in it 50 feet underwater!''
</P>
<P>
   After 30 dives, Klekowski's team is finished for the season, but
he doesn't feel the research is nearly done, and he hopes the MDC
will give them permission to dive next year. At 30 minutes per
dive, the divers say they're leaving just as they are making
interesting discoveries.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're just down there long enough for a snippet. There's a
whole photographic essay to be had down there,'' said Klekowski.

FOR BRIDGET JONES FANS, `A LITTLE MORE' ABOUT HER DIARIST 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   A LITTLE MORE ABOUT ME &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By Pam Houston &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Norton, 288 pp., $23.95 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I recently lent a young male friend ``Bridget Jones's Diary,''
the comic novel about an over-the-top neurotic single woman. After
reading some of it, he e-mailed me: ``Women are not really that
completely without confidence and desperate as that Bridget Jones
girl, or are they?''
</P>
<P>
   My friend, bless his heart, hasn't yet learned that many of the
strongest-seeming women have their own bits of Bridget _ a
character consumed by worry about her weight, men, and being at
peace with herself.
</P>
<P>
   These shared self-doubts are part of the bond among women, and a
large part of the reason writer Pam Houston has so many fans. Here
is a woman who has scaled mountains, guided numerous white-water
rafting trips, and led hunters through the Alaskan wilderness. Her
20s were spent ticking off, and writing about, one adventure after
the other, on five continents. All the while, she fretted about her
weight almost constantly, was largely motivated by men and romance,
and endlessly struggled to find peace with herself. In short, she's
Indiana Jones meets Bridget Jones.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Little More About Me,'' a collection of personal essays, is
her first nonfiction work, though her previous books, the very
popular ``Cowboys Are My Weakness'' and ``Waltzing the Cat,''
clearly had their roots in autobiography, as Houston has readily
confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   Only a handful of the book's offerings are new; most were either
published in women's and outdoors magazines or appeared in
anthologies. In ``The Long Way to Safety,'' an introduction of
sorts, Houston has finally (her summation) settled down, at a ranch
she bought in Creede, Colo., elevation 9,000 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Says the typically conflicted Houston: ``The road I've taken
these five years has been a long and twisted one. . . .Through the
windshield I can see everything I want to take with me: horses and
men and mountains and rivers. But in the rearview mirror, damned if
I don't see horses and men and mountains and rivers, everything I
need to leave behind.''
</P>
<P>
   In her late 30s, Houston has determined that ``the edge,''
though it still beckons, has lost much appeal. ``How many times can
you walk to the same edge and find it interesting? . . .I see new,
more interesting edges everywhere I look: artistic, spiritual,
emotional, even physical edges that don't necessarily involve
risking my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Because these essays were composed during a five-year span, some
relate more to the Indiana Jones, some to the Bridget; in others
the two meet and duke it out, or perhaps wind up in couples
counseling.
</P>
<P>
   Houston's writing is at its sparkling best when chronicling
trips, while gazing more at the stars than at herself. ``Soul of
the Andes'' brings together what is beautiful, maddening, and great
fun about South American travel. And she pays moving homage to the
people and the land of Bhutan in ``In Bhutan, There is No Way to be
Famous,'' based on her rugged Himalayan trek there.
</P>
<P>
   It's in the grouping of essays titled ``One Long Look in the
Mirror'' that the author's self-doubt, even self-loathing, becomes
almost too painful too bear. But one can understand the source of
her emptiness and confusion. Houston's father, a natural athlete,
wanted her to rival Chris Evert in tennis. She didn't come close.
Her mother, a former actress, wanted Houston to be beautiful, which
to her mind meant thin, with well-applied makeup and good hair. She
failed again. Her home was cold, violent, and unsafe, and Houston
believes that is why she went after danger, to find the
``comforts'' of home.
</P>
<P>
   While men come and men go, her dogs remain by her side. Her deep
connection with them is chronicled in several pieces, including the
final essay, ``Home is Where Your Dogs Are,'' a sweet eulogy for
her canine companion Jackson and a homecoming for herself. Though
she will always mourn her longtime sidekick, ``I no longer feel
like I won't be able to live without him. He saw me through the
loneliest years . . . years that I needed to live through, before I
could find my way home.''

LETTERS SHOW JACK BENNY'S RAUNCHY SIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SAM ALLIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Jack Benny wrote raunchy letters. Who knew?
</P>
<P>
   The man whose deadpan remains the nonpareil of stand-up comedy
loved to write gamy missives marbled with locker-room humor and
four-letter no-nos. His fifth-grade bathroom humor comes as a shock
to those accustomed to his droll, civilized presence on radio and
television.
</P>
<P>
   To testify that the letters are awfully funny is as meaningless
as it is to say that a woman is beautiful sight unseen.
</P>
<P>
   But this is a family newspaper and not the appropriate place to
plumb Benny's riffs on enemas and sex. Suffice it to say that to
read his letters is to shatter the sepulchral silence of the rare
books and manuscripts room of the Boston Public Library. Not to
worry. Roberta Zonghi, keeper of the collections, and her staff are
used to people wiping the tears from their faces as they read
Benny's account of his visit to the Mayo Clinic or his thoughts on
an African chief who spent four years blowing a coin through a clay
pipe.
</P>
<P>
   Benny's letters arrived at the library last year, when Zonghi
purchased more than 100 of them written to Frank Remley, his old
friend and admirer, for $39,000. The acquisition was designed to
augment its Fred Allen collection as well as leaven the library's
august treasure trove. Benny and Allen knew each other as fellow
radio luminaries. Allen, one of radio's most brilliant humorists,
was born in Cambridge, the son of a onetime bookbinder at the BPL,
and was a runner at the institution while a youngster.
</P>
<P>
   Benny penned scads of letters longhand from his home in Beverly
Hills and hotels from London to Sydney. The hotel stationery
includes marvelous telephone exchanges like Balzac 3530 for the
Georges V in Paris and ELdorado 5 2800 for the Sherry Netherlands
in New York. He usually pegged his thoughts to the ``Ripley's
Believe It Or Not'' staple that ran daily in hundreds of
newspapers. He would tear off the Ripley's item and include it with
his musings on the subject of the day.
</P>
<P>
   One could do worse than to spend an hour reading Benny's
missives. They make us like him all the more. We'd love to go to a
ball game with the guy because we now know that he could be
scatologically funny, too. Besides, his stuff is free and a far
better deal than another inane $8 Hollywood offering.
</P>
<P>
   My own favorite involves Emperor Vitellius, who, according to
Ripley's, ate 1,200 oysters in one meal. My lips are sealed. Again,
this is a family newspaper.

   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ His research subjects are swimming in a tank
of murky green water as John Shih explains how, by manipulating a
gene or two, he can enlarge a pancreas or grow saucer eyes on a
zebra fish. As senior scientist for a biotechnology firm, Shih and
his experiments on zebra fish offer clues about how human tissues
grow.
</P>
<P>
   Across town, Jill Mesirov sits in her office overlooking Kendall
Square, gazing into a computer screen displaying a wall of A's,
T's, G's, and C's _ code used by geneticists to represent the
building blocks of the human genome, which is the set of all genes.
Mesirov, a statistician at the Whitehead Institute, hunts for
patterns buried in the code that may link a specific gene to a
specific disease.
</P>
<P>
   A block away, Colin Dykes talks of a day when prescription drugs
are matched to a patient's gene profile to improve drug efficacy or
eliminate side effects. ``We are talking about a revolution in the
future of medicine,'' he says. ``I wanted to be part of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Dykes wanted it so much that he left London and his job at a big
pharmaceutical company a year ago to direct genomics research for
tiny Cambridge-based Variagenics Inc. Ten months before Dykes's
trans-Atlantic move, Shih had come to Cambridge from Pasadena,
Calif. Mesirov joined the Whitehead Institute as associate director
in January 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Each is engaged in his or her own arcane pursuits, but Dykes,
Shih, and Mesirov are all members of a community that sprouted in
Cambridge in just a few years to explore the medical and
money-making potential of information spewing out of research on
the human genome.
</P>
<P>
   The acceleration in recent years of gene discoveries is, as
Dykes said, a medical revolution, and it will take years to play
out. But the economic benefits of this revolution are happening
right here and right now in Cambridge, Mass. In Genetown USA.
</P>
<P>
   The magnet for this economic activity is the Whitehead
Institute/Massachusetts Institute of Technology Center for Genome
Research. The Cambridge research institution is among the leaders
in the Human Genome Project, a worldwide effort to identify 100,000
human genes.
</P>
<P>
   The Human Genome Project has not had as big an impact as the
Internet on the local economy. But the quest for gene-derived
drugs, therapies, and diagnostics is having a visible impact on
Cambridge, economists and experts in the field say.
</P>
<P>
   Small biotech companies trying to develop drugs based on
pioneering gene research are popping up in Kendall Square as
rapidly as bacteria in a petri dish. Pharmaceutical companies
searching for drug leads are swarming in to collaborate with
university professors and clinical researchers working in the
field.
</P>
<P>
   Funding for gene research in Cambridge attracted $18 million in
research funds in 1998 _ up $5 million in five years _ from the
National Genome Research Institute of the National Institutes of
Health. That's more than was granted to San Francisco and Berkeley
combined.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Boston area,'' said Eric Lander, head of the Whitehead
genomics center and unofficial mayor of Genetown, ``is one of the
hotbeds of genetics and genomics.''
</P>
<P>
   The gene boom is centered in Cambridge because the city _ with
its universities, entrepreneurs, medical research schools, and
biotech companies _ provides a potent brew in which a ``gene
industry'' is cultivated.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists bumping into each other in Kendall Square are
engaging in a continual dialogue about the newest news about their
own or colleagues' research. The cross-pollenization that occurs,
often between academics and private industry, is an invisible force
that drives the gene industry's growth, economists and industry
executives say.
</P>
<P>
   These conversations are ``like neutrons bouncing around a
nuclear reactor,'' said Elliott Hillback Jr., senior vice president
for Genzyme Corp. ``It's hard to prove it's even happening, but you
can feel the energy.''
</P>
<P>
   And the gene field is so hot that it has suddenly become cool to
be a biologist, a profession once relegated to dank labs smelling
of formaldehyde. At MIT, about 140 students declare biology as
their major _ double their numbers a decade ago, according to MIT
professor and Nobel Prize recipient Phillip Sharp, former chairman
of the biology department.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are increasing career and commercial opportunities in
the development and application of biological sciences to the real
world,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sharp would know: He made millions by helping to found
Cambridge-based Biogen Inc. and is among at least a dozen
``biomillionaires'' recently identified in Massachusetts.

CHINA TOPS US LIST OF RELIGIOUS INTOLERANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   China was at the top of a list of seven nations the US State
Department said are of ``particular concern'' because of their
mistreatment of religious believers.
</P>
<P>
   Under provisions of the 1998 International Religious Freedom
Act, the seven are potentially subject to a host of economic
sanctions by the White House. However, the Clinton administration
can waive all sanctions for national security reasons.
</P>
<P>
   The other nations cited were Afghanistan, Burma, Iran, Iraq,
Serbia, and Sudan. The list was announced this week as a follow-up
to a State Department report that described prohibitions placed on
religious freedom in more than 190 countries and territories.
</P>
<P>
   The report accused China of ``government intolerance'' of all
religions not officially approved by Beijing, including
Christianity, Tibetan Buddhism, and Islam. The persecution consists
of long jail sentences and the closing of religious sites, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
   China dismissed those charges as false, saying it only
persecutes criminals.

   --The official newspaper of Louis Farrakhan's Nation of Islam
said the destruction and death caused by Hurricane Floyd was
``God's judgement'' against the United States for the ``past and
present evil'' done to blacks and American Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Floyd slammed the Southeast in late September, killing more than
60 people, forcing thousands to flee flooded homes, and causing
billions of dollars worth of damage.
</P>
<P>
   The Final Call, the Nation of Islam newspaper, said in an
editorial this week that additional hurricanes, earthquakes, and
snowstorms would bring the United States ``to her knees'' unless it
repents for past and present injustices committed against blacks
and native Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``God is angry with America and no federal funding can change
that _ true repentance and justice are the only way out, if it's
not already too late,'' the newspaper said.

   --The families of students killed in the April shooting at
Columbine High School have sued the Jefferson County School
District in Colorado, alleging they were barred from using
religious themes in a display of memorial titles in the school's
hallways.
</P>
<P>
   The suit, filed this week, says the school violated the
families' First Amendment rights of freedom of religious expression
and free speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the midst of extreme sufferring and grief, the school
district's hostility to the religious beliefs that have sustained
these families is disturbing,'' said John W. Whitehead, president
of the Rutherford Institute, a conservative civil liberties group
based in Charlottesville, Va., that is representing the families.

LIFE'S FRAGILITY POWERS A VOICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Since her early days as Elton John's backup singer and then a
solo artist and Grammy nominee, Cindy Bullens was a
``straight-ahead, slam-bam, thank you, ma'am'' kind of performer,
to quote her own words.
</P>
<P>
   That all changed three years ago, when her 11-year-old daughter,
Jessie, lost a battle with cancer after being diagnosed just three
months before. Suddenly, Bullens had a new purpose. She began
writing about the fragility of life, about self-examination, and
healing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just picked up a guitar one day and was strumming it when
the song `Between Heaven and Earth' came out,'' Bullens says of the
title track to her new album. ``I wasn't exactly thrilled to write
a song about the death of my own child. But I also knew I was doing
what I needed to do for myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Bullens, who lives in Portland, Maine, feels that her latest
songs _ the album features guests Bonnie Raitt, Lucinda Williams,
and Beth Nielsen Chapman (who lost her husband to cancer) _ are a
``gift.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've lost my daughter and there's just no describing the
experience,'' says Bullens. ``But it feels as if I'm part of a
bigger picture now. I don't want it to sound too simple or New
Age-y, but I really feel Jessie has given me the gift of these
songs, and it's my mission to go out and sing them. I don't have a
career goal. I'm just going out there one day at a time. I'm
enjoying playing these songs and am getting an incredible reaction
face-to-face.''
</P>
<P>
   The songs are excruciatingly personal, as Bullens _ blessed with
a powerful voice _ belts them from the depth of her being. But they
also have a universal appeal, applying to love stories of any kind.
She poignantly cites ``losing forever in the blink of an eye'' in
the title track. She later sings ``I've lost your summer laughter
to a thousand shades of gray'' and ``there was a time when I was so
inspired by life's mystery _ can I find my way back?'' She finally
realizes she can in the closer, ``Better than Ever Before,'' with
the line, ``Don't count me out _ sometimes, I'm stronger than I've
ever felt.''
</P>
<P>
   Jessie died of an infection during treatment for Hodgkin's
disease. ``She had a seizure on the morning of my birthday on March
21, 1996, and died March 23 after being on life support,'' says
Bullens. ``All of her friends came in to say goodbye to her. We
were just totally shocked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jessie was an unbelievable kid, let's start there. Every time
I try to describe her, I feel I'm coming up way too short. She was
born with an attitude toward life _ and we knew this from birth _
that was completely joyful. I said this way before she was sick.
This is not a glorified personality sketch after the death of my
child. She knew what life was about. She knew life was to be
treasured and enjoyed, but she always had passion for the underdog
and hated what was wrong with the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was a spirited child _ maybe the most spirited person I
ever knew in my life. She was the only girl on her Little League
team and the star of the soccer team. She was strong and vibrant
and active.''
</P>
<P>
   Bullens, who is now in her mid-40s, and her husband, Dan Crewe,
have another daughter, Reid, now 17, who sings on the new album.
Crewe manages Bob Clearmountain, a well-known sound-mixer for top
rock acts, and also started Gateway Studio in Portland with
mastering engineer Bob Ludwig.
</P>
<P>
   Crewe's brother, Bob, who has worked with Frankie Valli and the
Four Seasons and Mitch Ryder, helped Bullens get started in the
'70s in Los Angeles, where Bullens went ``with my knapsack and a
guitar'' after growing up in West Newbury, north of Boston.
</P>
<P>
   By crashing a party, Bullens met Elton John in LA and ended up
doing three tours with him in 1975 and 1976. She sang with John
when he played the 1976 Bicentennial concert at Foxboro Stadium
(then called Shaeffer Stadium) with the Eagles and Fleetwood Mac.
She also sang on John's hit single ``Don't Go Breakin' My Heart''
before making her solo debut album, ``Desire Wire,'' in 1979. It
yielded the hit, ``Survivor,'' and a Grammy nomination for best
rock vocal.
</P>
<P>
   Bullens released two albums and each time the record label
folded. So she ``took a break that turned into a long break'' by
having children, though she's also recorded with Raitt, Bob Dylan,
and Rod Stewart, and has written for the Dixie Chicks.
</P>
<P>
   But the new disc represents an unexpected comeback. At first,
she pressed only 1,000 CDs, with the proceeds going to the
nonprofit Jessie Bullens-Crewe Foundation (PO Box 1083, Portland,
ME 04104). Then the CD was discovered by Danny Goldberg _ former
boss of Mercury Records and now of Artemis Records _ who signed her
to Artemis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was stunned,'' admits Bullens. ``My first question (to him)
was, `Do you understand why I did this record?' It's not to
resurrect my career. It's not for commercial reasons. He understood
and I'm very grateful.''

PITT REVEALS LITTLE; NEW YORKER'S UP-AND-COMERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BETH CARNEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As gimmicks go, the image of Brad Pitt lounging in a T-shirt
mini dress and shaved head on the cover of Rolling Stone is pretty
tame. An inside photo spread shows the actor flexing his biceps on
the beach wearing a strappy sequined number.
</P>
<P>
   What the accompanying profile fails to explain is why the
famously pretty star, now promoting his macho guy movie ``The Fight
Club,'' chose to pose in drag. Aside from acknowledging it was his
idea, Pitt has little to say about the attempt at
attention-grabbing (``There's nothing to talk about.'') He's
similarly tightlipped about having the caps on his front teeth
filed down for the role (``Not talking about it.'') and gets
animated only when arguing with interviewer Chris Heath about
whether it's fair to ask him if he plays up a dumb-blond image.
(Pitt thinks not). The piece's most articulate comments, in fact,
come from ``Fight Club'' co-star Edward Norton, who stands up for
Pitt: ``I think it's a shame if politeness and humility are
perceived as a kind of rube-ish disengenuousness.''
</P>
<P>
   More revealing is the magazine's profile of 18-year-old singer
Christina Aguilera, one in the stable of former cast members of
``The New Mickey Mouse Show'' (think Britney Spears, 'N Sync's
Justin Timberlake, and ``Felicity's'' Keri Russell) working their
way into the ranks of teen stardom, in Aguilera's case with a
rumored $1 million backing from RCA Records. When not cruising to
McDonald's in a stretch limousine, ordering around reporter Anthony
Bozza, and complaining about the back-stabbing in her high school's
cheerleader clique, the young singer apparently exhibits some real
talent. ``Christina threw me at first, because she could sing so
well,'' says David Frank, who co-wrote her current hit ``Genie in a
Bottle.'' ``In the teen-pop world, I've found myself in a room a
few times where no one could sing.''

   Young up-and-comers are the core of The New Yorker's double
``Next Generation'' theme issue. Fifteen-year-old Concord novelist
Amelia Atwater-Rhodes, 17-year-old Def Jam Records' rapper Shanell
Jones (a.k.a. Lady Luck), 33-year-old Harvard economist Caroline
Minter Hoxby, and 8-year-old chess prodigy David Howell are among
the many precocious talents getting ink. One of the most absorbing
pieces, however, is 29-year-old New York writer/professional
personal essayist Meghan Daum's story about how she slipped into
$75,000 worth of debt while working as, by many measures, a
successful freelance writer in the most expensive city in the
United States. Daum's story is familiar to many of her peers: Her
debt can be traced to student loans she took out to finance a
graduate degree, dental work she paid out of pocket because she
couldn't afford insurance, and to the ``certain ephemeral
luxuries'' seen as necessities by her 20-something college-educated
urban demographic, like Starbucks coffee breaks and sushi lunches
and casual long-distance phone calls. In addition to illustrating
an increasingly common American predicament, the piece offers
insight to those of us who have followed Daum's regular column in
Self magazine and wondered why an obviously talented writer would
continue to turn her most trivial experiences into published
personal essays; she really needed the money.

   Ms. magazine features a special report on Thailand's sex trade
and its effect on the girls and young women who support their
families by working as prostitutes. Betty Rogers describes how the
business has grown in the past 30 years to an estimated $4
billion-a-year industry employing several million workers. Rogers
visits the famous nightclubs targeting international tourists in
the Patpong district of Bangkok, and interviews teenage
prostitutes, many of whom work essentially as indentured servants.
Parents borrow money from club recruiters and hand their daughters
over to pay off the debt. As the economic collapse limits these
young women's career options further, Rogers finds that the
recruiting techniques have also changed; now more and more girls _
including undocumented immigrants fleeing nearby countries like
Burma, Cambodia, and Vietnam _ enter the trade voluntarily.

   Spin magazine seems to have lost some of its wacky irreverance
since the firing of editor in chief Michael Hirschorn earlier this
year, but it still can be relied upon for informative, amusing
takes on various subcultures. In the November issue, Mike Romano
offers a story on the future of computer hacking as a means of
political protest, or ``hacktivism.'' The chief debate is whether
individualistic hackers are using their technological skills for
meaningful protest or simple vandalism. One of the more successful
hacks, a computer science student who goes by the name Bronc
Buster, managed to infiltrate the Chinese goverment's Web site and
replace it with a diatribe asserting the country's leaders were
``thugs and bullies.'' In retrospect, Bronc tells Spin he wishes he
didn't use a four-letter word ``after every other word.''

   The downside of the gene boom for longtime residents of
Cambridge is that wealthy entrepreneurs and well-paid employees of
pharmaceutical companies are helping drive up rents and house
prices in a difficult real estate market. Young professionals who
snap up houses in East Cambridge to be close to Kendall Square feed
a real estate boom in neighborhoods that once were a key location
for low-cost rental units.
</P>
<P>
   Some Cambridge residents complain the high-tech, biotech boom
has robbed the city of its shabby-chic charm. In the ``new
Cambridge,'' the Blue Room restaurant in Kendall Square is often
packed with MIT scientists or biotech executives who amble over for
roast chicken at $18 a plate.
</P>
<P>
   Money is flowing into Cambridge due to the Human Genome Project,
which has rejuvenated a biotech industry that never fully recovered
from a late-1980s crash, economists and industry executives said.
</P>
<P>
   The formation of firms searching for gene-based drugs has helped
propel New England past San Francisco for the first time, according
to a January study by the accounting firm Ernst &AMP; Young. In 1998,
New England had a total of 193 biotech firms; the Bay Area had 185.
</P>
<P>
   No data exists on how many jobs have been generated by the
explosion in private and public gene efforts. Cambridge employers
range from a large company, Millennium Pharmaceuticals, which
employs more than 800, to Harvard University's newly established
Center for Genomics, which expects to employ about 60 people in two
years.
</P>
<P>
   But the gene boom has helped fuel a tripling, to 25,000, in
employees in Massachusetts' biotech industry since 1991. A study on
the state's pharmaceutical industry by Anurag Sharma, business
professor at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, found the
genome project was responsible, directly or indirectly, for a
significant share of a doubling in research jobs, to 12,538,
between 1995 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The genome project is ``attracting a lot of investment and
jobs,'' Sharma said. ``It's going to continue.''
</P>
<P>
   The most dramatic trend has been a sudden influx into Cambridge
of giant pharmaceutical companies, many of them in the past two
years, to set up research facilities. The list is a Who's Who of
German and US companies, including Bayer AG, Hoechst Marion
Roussel, BASF Research Corp., Merck, American Home Products Corp.,
Amgen Inc., and Bristol-Meyers Squibb Co.
</P>
<P>
   Pharmaceutical giants are in a desperate ``land grab'' to secure
patents on genes or drug targets as soon as they are uncovered from
research scientists. These companies sense that gene-based drugs
may change the shape of the entire industry, and they want to be in
on it.
</P>
<P>
   When W. Stephen Faraci is not recruiting employees for Pfizer
Inc.'s new research center in Cambridge, he is courting MIT and
Boston University professors or physicians at Children's Hospital
and Massachusetts General Hospital for research collaborations that
may provide drug targets the parent company's scientists can
pursue.
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer's Drug Discovery Center opened a year ago on Memorial
Drive and employs 30. ``We're trying to find the stuff that's brand
new. You have to go to the genome for that,'' said Faraci.
</P>
<P>
   The kind of success pharmaceutical giants are looking for may be
close at hand for tiny Ontogeny Inc. in Cambridge.
</P>
<P>
   Ontogeny's chief executive, Doros Platika, hopes to bring the
firm's treatment for basal cell carcinoma, a skin cancer, into
clinical trials within the next two years.
</P>
<P>
   The key to the treatment is the ``hedgehog'' gene, which
controls cell growth in humans _ and zebra fish. To oversimplify,
skin cancer is caused when the switch in the hedgehog gene
malfunctions and won't turn off cell growth, as it should. ``It's
like the accelerator getting stuck,'' Platika said. ``We have a
drug that unsticks the accelerator.''
</P>
<P>
   Surrounded by his fish tanks and lab equipment, Ontogeny's
senior scientist, John Shih, explains the advantages of
experimenting on fish: the zebra fish develops from embryo to fully
developed fish in one day. ``You can have a sound set of
experiments in two days,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Shih is typical of the scientists in the gene field who are
drawn from top-drawer universities or research institutions into
private industry. He received a doctorate from the University of
California at Berkeley and completed post-doctoral research at the
California Institute of Technology in Pasadena.
</P>
<P>
   Dari Shalon straddles both worlds, academia and private
industry. He moved to Harvard Square from the Bay Area this summer
after accepting the job as the first director of Harvard's Center
for Genomics.
</P>
<P>
   Shalon holds a computer chip that reads gene sequences _ a chip
he designed as his dissertation project at Stanford University and
turned into a personal fortune by founding a California company to
make them. He sold the company, Synteni, in December 1997 for $100
million to Incyte Pharmaceuticals Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the best biological science is being done by companies
doing basic R&AMP;D on diseases,'' Shalon argued. ``I feel comfortable
in both.''

FOR COMPANIES, CREDIBILITY COUNTS ABOVE ALL

<P>
   So, how's the new job going?
</P>
<P>
   If anyone has even an inkling of how Raytheon Co. chief
executive Daniel Burnham feels this morning, it might be Michael
Hawley, the CEO of Gillette Co.
</P>
<P>
   Burnham and Hawley both recently replaced larger-than-life chief
executives at leading Massachusetts companies and soon ran into
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Burnham, a former vice chairman at Allied Signal, took over last
summer for Dennis Picard, who had steered Raytheon to an unlikely
survival in the great defense industry consolidation with a series
of bold deals. This year Hawley succeeded Al Zeien, who boosted
Gillette's stock market value tenfold in eight years with a long
list of consumer products like the Mach 3 razor.
</P>
<P>
   Neither company will remember 1999 as a glory year.
</P>
<P>
   Worse than simple business disappointments, Raytheon and
Gillette dinged their long-standing reputations as financially
dependable and credible producers with unexpected bad-news bombs
this year. Real credibility is a serious asset on Wall Street and
it hurts to chip away a chunk.
</P>
<P>
   The news at Gillette seemed unpleasant enough, failing to make
good on a promised second-half sales rebound, and it has battered
the company's stock by 23 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   But that turned out to be a walk in the park compared with the
truly breathtaking turn of events at Raytheon Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   For a while, it did not look as though shares of the nation's
third-largest defense contractor would even open for trading on the
New York Stock Exchange. When they finally did late Tuesday
afternoon, the people who wanted to sell at any price did just
that, and the company's market value plunged by 46 percent, to 24
1/4, in about one hour. Nearly $8 billion in value vaporized.
</P>
<P>
   If pressed to guess, we would expect Raytheon shares will regain
a part of that loss Wednesday. But in some ways, the selloff
Tuesday was even worse than it appeared. After all, this was a
stock that traded for 68 per share just five weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   This may be the common fate of an Internet company that misses
its quarterly forecast, but it is uncharted territory for an
industrial giant like Raytheon.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the financial setbacks alone hurt Raytheon stock. But
the gap between the company's view of business just a month ago
(wary but not bleak) and what it said Tuesday generated a wave of
no-confidence sentiment from analysts who follow the stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever the reason, they didn't communicate the problems,''
said analyst Robert Friedman of the Standard &AMP; Poors Equity Group.
``It seriously damages the credibility of management with
investors.''
</P>
<P>
   The company issued a statement about its latest problems Tuesday
morning, and then Burnham participated in what can only be
described as a grueling conference call with stock analysts for
about two hours.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst calls are usually polite and numbingly dull affairs but
the tone Tuesday was distinctly prickly. At one point, Burham said
he was going through the unpleasant exercise to help restore
credibility and emphasized the demand for candor inside the
company.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've told people don't hide behind hope, don't hide behind
commitments to previous leaders. That's the tone here. We hope it's
resonated throughout and we think it has, but nobody can guarantee
anything. We think we have plumbed the depths.''
</P>
<P>
   The good news for Raytheon is that you can win back investor
confidence. The bad news is that it only happens in a series of
small steps that can take years.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The friendly banker?
</P>
<P>
   Richard Chapman has done a lot of things to employ the millions
his Brookline Bancorp raised from its 1998 stock offering, from
repurchasing shares to seeding an Internet bank start-up.
</P>
<P>
   Now he has applied to regulators for permission to buy up to
24.9 percent of Medford Bancorp, viewed by some as a potentially
hostile advance on the holding company that owns the $1.2 billion
Medford Savings Bank.
</P>
<P>
   No way, says the Brookline Bancorp chief exective.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been misinterpreted and we're probably going to amend
it,'' said Chapman. ``We're friendly, long-term investors.''
</P>
<P>
   Hostile bids for banks are extremely rare and any takeover of
Medford Bancorp would require a two-thirds majority vote of
shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Medford chief executive Arthur Meehan declined to comment about
the Brookline stake in his company.
</P>
<P>
   The request filed with the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston
disclosed that Brookline Bancorp already owned 4.9 percent of the
Medford banking company, the maximum allowed without requiring
disclosure and regulatory approval.
</P>
<P>
   Practically all of the stock was purchased in a single block on
April 9, according to James Moynihan, the Advest Inc. executive who
brokered the transaction.
</P>
<P>
   Chapman said he wanted to buy more stock when Medford shares
fell below 15 per share last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt very frustrated,'' he said. ``The price was in the
basement as far as we were concerned and we couldn't do a darn
thing about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Chapman noted that a shareholder rights plan at Medford Bancorp
would be triggered if any single investor amassed a 15 percent
interest in the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no intention of going above that,'' he said.

EASY RIDERS ARE HARD TO FIND BACKSTAGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MALCOLM MAYHEW 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the president of downtown Fort Worth's live-music palace, the
Caravan of Dreams, Jerry Thompson has his share of ``rider''
stories to tell.
</P>
<P>
   Like the time metal act Dream Theater requested six pairs of
clean underwear.
</P>
<P>
   Or the time guitar hero Buddy Guy asked for a $175 bottle of
whiskey.
</P>
<P>
   And then there was Judas Priest's ludicrous request: strippers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They ask for the world, and we more than take care of them,''
Thompson said. ``But we also draw a line in the sand. I gotta cross
out a lot of stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   A ``rider'' is a list of items that a band or artist wants/needs
before, during or after the concert. Band writes it. Management
faxes it. Venue checks off or crosses out items, sends back to
management and band. Band usually frowns.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, venues are not contractually obligated to fulfill
them. Riders, in other words, are simply wish lists, composed of
the usual (food and beverages) and unusual (see above).
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, the bigger the act, the bigger the rider. It's
not uncommon for big-name artists to request hotel rooms and
transportation.
</P>
<P>
   In the '70s and '80s, riders rose to ridiculously excessive
heights, a reflection of rock's extravagance and overindulgence.
Venues often wound up spending as much or more money on riders as
on the band.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can do a show and pay a band X amount of dollars, and the
rider can be an extra two or three thousand dollars,'' Thompson
said. ``You pay them $100,000, that gets them on stage. But there's
a lot of freight to get them there.''
</P>
<P>
   Area venue owners and promoters say that although the concert
industry has been steadily cracking down on rider expenses, goofy
oddities remain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think some bands request stuff just to see if they can get
away with it,'' said Kris Youmans, who helps book Rubber Gloves
Rehearsal Studios, a Denton, Texas-based venue that caters to
underground rock bands.
</P>
<P>
   Youmans recalls the time that indie-rock heroes June of 44
played there.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted a copy of that day's New York Times and (band
leader) Jeff Mueller wanted a fresh thing of drum tobacco so he
could roll his own cigarettes. Just real obscure stuff that there's
no way we're gonna go out and get for 'em.''
</P>
<P>
   Another odd Rubber Gloves request came via punk-pop outfit
Servotron.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted four cans of WD-40 and all these batteries,'' said
Robin Phillips, who also books Rubber Gloves concerts. ``They dress
up like robots and they have all this metal stuff that they have to
oil. I was like, `No way. Batteries not included.' ''
</P>
<P>
   That's nothing compared with the humorous horror stories that
have leaked out of Starplex Amphitheater's backstage area in
Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   According to a backstage source who refused to be named _ they
need their jobs, after all _ one A-list R&AMP;B star insisted on having
a special toilet seat when she played there last year. ``It was
supposed to be a certain kind, with a certain type of cushion. Took
us forever to find one and apparently, she just used it once, then
threw it away.''
</P>
<P>
   The all-female tour Lilith Fair, the Starplex source says, was
another nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't imagine. They wanted all this specially prepared,
fussy food. Some of the (performers) were hard-core vegetarians, so
they'd be like, `No this, no that. Can't eat that, can't drink
this.' They were real nice, but it was a major pain.''
</P>
<P>
   Big names don't always equal big riders, though.
</P>
<P>
   One of pop and country music's most successful _ and elaborate _
performers is also one of its most low-maintenance: Reba McEntire.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has no rider,'' said Thompson, who has worked on past
McEntire shows. ``She just says, `Please provide a hot meal for me
and my people' and that's it. That's the only thing she asks for.''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, McEntire's not the norm. But, Thompson says, a lot of
performers are starting to follow her bare-necessities needs: A
good slice of performers are just asking for nutritious meals.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's definitely a move toward healthier ... food,'' he
said. ``Some of them are strict about it, too. Eric Johnson
requests pasta with no MSGs. And all David Sanborn eats is papayas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The old days of rock are still around, just not as much as
they used to be,'' Thompson said. ``We still get acts that request
marijuana, but of course, we don't deliver.''
</P>

 NGES PLANNED IN WOMEN'S SOFTBALL LEAGUE  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA HUEBNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some big changes are in store for the three-year-old Women's Pro
Softball League in this upcoming Olympic year, and some will last
well beyond 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Next summer, with the US national team's drive to defend its
Olympic gold medal in full swing, the WPSL will reorganize to give
the team someone to play on a national tour. Instead of six teams
in North Carolina, Georgia, Virginia, Florida, and Ohio, the league
will cut back to two teams in the Akron area _ whose Racers enjoyed
the best attendance in the league, averaging 1,200 to 1,500 per
game _ and two near Tampa.
</P>
<P>
   Each week, a pair of teams will play each other and a third will
conduct camps and clinics, while the fourth will play the national
team. Tour dates and locations have yet to be announced, although
up to 20 are being considered.
</P>
<P>
   Two league members, Crystl Bustos and Michelle Venturella, are
among the 15 players recently named to the national team.
</P>
<P>
   The reorganization will also give the league a chance to
reevaluate itself. Except for Akron, attendance has been
disappointing, and league spokesman Drew Russell said there are no
plans to return to either Gastonia, N.C., or Columbus, Ohio, after
2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to be seeking new cities on this tour,'' he said,
to be included when the league resumes a normal structure following
the Sydney Games.
</P>
<P>
   Despite attendance so low that the league won't disclose figures
for anywhere but Akron, TV ratings have been more than favorable,
with about 205,000 households tuning in each time a game is shown
on tape delay on ESPN2. That's comparable to the audience for
National Hockey League games shown on the same channel.
</P>
<P>
   In other league action, a national tryout will be held Dec. 5 in
St. Petersburg, Fla., with all women's fastpitch players who have
completed their collegiate softball eligibility invited to
participate. For more information, call Hildred Deese, director of
game operations for the league, at 303-316-7800.

JIMMY JOHNSON IS STILL IN THE CHASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   To Jimmy Johnson, this pursuit is not trivial. He's tired of
trying to catch up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every year it seems like we are always chasing somebody,'' the
Dolphins coach said Tuesday. ``The first couple of years it was New
England. Then the Jets last year, now it's New England again. I
would like to see that change.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson knows it will have to start changing Sunday in
Foxborough, where he has not had a lot of good fortune. Johnson has
never beaten the Patriots in New England as the Dolphins coach, and
if he doesn't do it this week he will be chasing them down the
stretch one more time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at them on film and they are playing very well,'' said
Johnson. ``Bledsoe is doing everything with such a nice rhythm.
There is only a handful of times in the games we've looked at that
you don't see that. And every where you look, you see Terry Glenn.
We know we are going to have to do something to handle Bledsoe and
Glenn to have a chance to win this game up there.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson is very concerned about New England's offense, because
his highly regarded defense was ripped apart by the Colts last
Sunday in Indianapolis. The Colts have the same kind of offense as
the Patriots with a great pitch-and-dash team of Peyton Manning and
Marvin Harrison.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really disappointed with the way we played defense in
Indianapolis,'' said Johnson. ``It hurt us that Terrell Buckley,
one of our best cover guys, hurt his ankle and wasn't available.
But our offense came alive in the second half and we came back to
win the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Miami is 3-1 and tied with Buffalo for second place in the AFC
East. New England is at the top at 4-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``This division is going to be a wild scramble,'' said Johnson.
``The Jets are down, but they will knock off some contending teams
when this is finished. The Colts are the most-improved team, and I
think they will be in it all the way. Buffalo has a great
defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Miami's defense played well in the season's first three games
before giving up 31 points to the Colts. However, their offense
stumbled and staggered in games against Arizona and Buffalo, losing
to the Bills and Doug Flutie at home.
</P>
<P>
   Miami plays much better defense at home than on the road. Last
year the same defensive group fell apart in the second half in
Foxborough, when the Patriots came from 16 points behind to earn a
great victory in the final minute.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson feels his offense found the answer to scoring points
with its game-winning outburst in the second half against the
Colts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed to spread the ball around more in our passing
game,'' said Johnson, who publicly criticized quarterback Dan
Marino after the loss to Buffalo. Johnson pointed out the fact that
wide receiver Tony Martin, signed as a free agent in the offseason
to be a deep threat, caught just two passes against Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tony caught 10 passes against the Colts, and many of them were
big plays,'' said Johnson. ``He's very important to what we are
trying to do and we have to get him the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are still not running the ball well. This team hasn't run
the ball for 15 years,'' Johnson said with a laugh. ``We thought it
would be better but it hasn't turned out that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Miami has been without Richmond Webb (knee) and Mark Dixon
(groin), two of its best offensive lineman. Johnson says he hopes
to have both back Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we lose this game, we will be behind the eight-ball the
rest of the way,'' said Johnson, knowing he has already lost to
Buffalo at home and has to try to beat New England in Foxborough
and Buffalo on the road.
</P>
<P>
   New England-Miami games have been special the last two years.
All four have been decided by 3 points or less, and one in
overtime. The teams are very well-matched; both rely on the pass
and can't run. Both are aggressive on defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Patriots are playing much better defense than their stats
indicate,'' said Johnson. ``They have been very physical. I was
impressed when I watched them on film. As a team we know we are
going to have to give it our best shot to win up there.''

   DELHI _ A nuclear exchange between India and Pakistan would
result in 17 million immediate deaths in Pakistan and 30 to 35
million in India, according to a study by the University of
Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night's military takeover in Pakistan raised the
question of whether such a scenario is now closer to becoming a
reality.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday the experts were downplaying any such fears:
Pakistan's nuclear weapons were already firmly in the control of
the military before the coup, they pointed out and in that respect
nothing has changed But complacency may be premature.
</P>
<P>
   From the point of view both of nuclear proliferation and of the
risk of starting a nuclear war, Pakistan under military rule will
be a greater menace than it was before.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan is a nuclear power on the verge of bankruptcy. Unless
General Pervez Musharraf appeases world opinion by promising a
speedy return to democratic rule, overseas aid will dry up and
Pakistan will be compelled to do whatever is necessary to earn
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   As U.S. Senator Daniel Moynihan said on Tuesday (before the
coup), ``Pakistan is not a stable country (and it is) an
impoverished country. That country will be selling nuclear weapons
to the Middle East.''
</P>
<P>
   A Saudi prince, he pointed out, was recently given a tour of
Pakistan's nuclear facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Equally serious is the fear of what Islamic hard-liners could do
if they took charge. General Musharraf is, as Benazir Bhutto put it
on Tuesday, ``not a cleric,'' but there are plenty in his army who
are fundamentalist Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   After years of fraternization with the likes of Afghanistan's
Taliban, many have a rooted conviction that Pakistan must wage
jihad (holy war) against infidel India.
</P>
<P>
   In a study of war and Islam entitled ``The Quranic Concept of
War,'' Brigadier S. K. Malik, who served under Pakistan's last
dictator, General Zia ul-Haq, said terror is central to the Islamic
conduct of modern war.
</P>
<P>
   ``Terror struck into the hearts of the enemy is not only a
means, it is the end in itself,'' he wrote. ``Once a condition of
terror in the opponent's heart is obtained, hardly anything is left
to be achieved...''
</P>
<P>
   An officer interviewed by Professor Stephen P. Cohen and quoted
in his book ``The Pakistan Army'' endorsed this view. ``Nuclear
weapons are modern terror weapons and Islam enjoins us to strike
terror into the heart of the enemy,'' he said. &QL;

<P>
   What, if anything, should the government do about the Internet?
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly a clutch of new technologies has burst upon the world,
and every government with any technical savvy realizes that how
well a country copes with these will determine its prosperity for a
generation. This is one you don't want to get wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Our own British government is no exception. Every minister with
any responsibility, however vestigial, for Net-related business is
scurrying around wanting briefings from experts, discussion papers
and meetings with Net entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, for example, saw Education and Employment Secretary
David Blunkett launching his ``e-mail forum.'' Prime Minister Tony
Blair has done the vision bit, saying that he wants to make Britain
a global leader in e-commerce. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 75 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 125) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now the minions have to do the practical side and come up with
policies to implement that vision. Expect a string of
``initiatives'' in the coming months, with lots of pictures of
beaming ministers leaning over computer screens.
</P>
<P>
   It will be the equivalent of the minister opening a new factory
for some Japanese company to make computer chips. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is that the Net is not like that. By its very nature
it is not susceptible to government intervention. Governments can
encourage inward investment by giving foreign companies the cash to
invest here.
</P>
<P>
   Money is not, of course, the only reason for investing here, but
it is a crucial one. And provided that a government is prepared to
allocate taxpayers' money to that end, it is easy for it to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Electronic commerce, by contrast, has grown up almost entirely
independently of governments and, in its early stages at least, of
big business. It is a bottom-up process, not a top-down one.
</P>
<P>
   True, the technical backbone of the Internet was originally
developed by the public sector, but its applications have been
developed entirely by tiny businesses _ or, at least, businesses
that were tiny until the Net propelled them to stardom.
</P>
<P>
   If you look at the way e-commerce has developed in the United
States, the striking thing is how little the government or the
corporate giants have had to do with it.
</P>
<P>
   So would the best policy for the British government be to follow
the course of the global leader, the U.S., and do nothing?
</P>
<P>
   Should it accept that its instincts to try to promote e-commerce
_ however well-meaning they may be _ are not only wrong, but may
have the perverse effect of inhibiting the native ingenuity of
British people who are trying to make a bob or two?
</P>
<P>
   Not quite. There are things that a wise government can do that
would help this country to garner a slightly larger share of the
global e-commerce cake than it would otherwise accrue.
</P>
<P>
   Here are five suggestions, golden rules about policy towards
e-commerce for a government anxious not to muck things up.
</P>
<P>
   RULE ONE is: do no harm. One of the many things that is truly
different about e-commerce is that it is borderless. Any service
can be located anywhere in the world and delivered at very low or
even zero cost. So any act that inhibits such trade will drive it
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   That does not mean that governments have no control at all, for
there are ethical and moral standards that they should seek to
uphold.
</P>
<P>
   For example, no country should seek to become a center for trade
in child pornography. But there are other types of e-commerce. For
example, gambling over the Net, which as we have seen with the
diversion of British betting to companies registered in Gibraltar,
can be driven abroad.
</P>
<P>
   That leads to RULE TWO: watch taxation and if necessary lose
some existing revenue in order to prevent taxation driving business
abroad.
</P>
<P>
   The direct taxation base of governments all over the world is
threatened by trade over the Net, for it is not just gambling that
can move offshore.
</P>
<P>
   Not all revenue is threatened; we are not going to be able to
fill up our cars with gasoline over the Net, so fuel duties will
remain. But high levels of VAT on goods that can be delivered over
a phone, such as software, will die. Better to have some tax,
albeit at a low rate, than none at all because the business has
gone abroad.
</P>
<P>
   RULE THREE is: crush the bureaucracy. E-commerce will come to a
place not just because it is lightly taxed but because the
administrative costs of setting up there are low.
</P>
<P>
   The UK seems to be a pretty good place to start a business, for
we are close to the bottom of the bureaucracy league table. But
there are aspects of doing business here, such as planning
controls, which are not business-friendly.
</P>
<P>
   Even e-businesses need to work from somewhere _ they need to
ship their products and employ people. Every incremental act of
bureaucracy will push a little bit of business offshore.
</P>
<P>
   RULE FOUR is: have effective pro-competition policies. One of
the reasons for the UK's speedy development of e-commerce has been
deregulation. Telecommunications in particular were deregulated
more quickly than in much of continental Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Any pro-competition policy _ say, encouraging cut-price airlines
_ will provoke a burst of applications of e-commerce, for the Net
provides a way to cut costs.
</P>
<P>
   RULE FIVE is: educate, educate, educate.
</P>
<P>
   We have very little idea of how e-commerce will develop over the
next five years. The browser, the key invention that enabled the
Internet to become a commercial reality, is only five years old;
look how far we have come since then.
</P>
<P>
   What we do know is that human capital _ how clever we are, how
well educated, how inventive, and how flexible in our ideas _ has
become a more important element in the commercial mix. Other
inputs, such as finance and factories, have become relatively less
important.
</P>
<P>
   Education is, to some extent, still within the power of
governments. It will become less so, as we come to educate
ourselves more and more by downloading packages over the Net
instead of being taught in conventional educational establishments.
</P>
<P>
   But basic education, the skills that enable us to access more
specialized education later on, is the responsibility of
government. Simple things, such as handling a Qwerty keyboard,
should be standard skills for everyone, not just the young. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 200 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 1,050) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This emphasis on education is not just to make us more efficient
or more able to garner a bigger share of the global e-commerce
cake. It is to reduce divisions in our society.
</P>
<P>
   The Net is inherently a democratizing technology, in that it
makes available to the many what was previously available only to
the few.
</P>
<P>
   As use spreads it will become yet more democratic, and big
companies are racing to make it simpler to access. But we shall
always need some skills to use it.
</P>
<P>
   There is a real danger that the people who most need the
benefits that e-commerce may bring _ such as cheaper banking and
travel _ won't get these because no one has helped them to find
their way around a keyboard.
</P>
<P>
   So there are things a wise government can do. They are not, with
the exception of the need to educate people in the new technology,
the clarion-call stuff that politicians like to announce.
</P>
<P>
   Some are just common sense. Some, like the need to admit that
some taxes may no longer be possible to collect, require a certain
humility. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONCLUDES AT 1,300) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Over the next generation the Net will make government less
important, not more. Meanwhile, wise governments can nudge a
country in the right direction; stupid ones can push the business
offshore. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   The vast majority of the houses built in the United States today
are constructed with wood. About 85 percent of that wood is used
for framing. Since wood has been the primary building material
since Colonial times, it might seem that there is no reason for
change, but wood has its drawbacks.
</P>
<P>
   In the first place, the supplies of old-growth timber are
diminishing. This has caused the price of construction lumber to
rise dramatically over the last few years. It has also forced the
lumber industry to harvest wood from young trees. This new wood has
a greater tendency to warp and split as it ages. This results in
cracks and warping appearing throughout the house soon after it is
finished.
</P>
<P>
   For this reason, some builders are looking for alternatives to
wood as framing. One possible substitute is steel. Steel can be
cold-rolled into pieces that are roughly the same size and shape as
dimensional framing lumber, so they can be used for studs, joists
or rafters. The pieces are rolled into a C cross section _ for that
reason they are called structural-C members, C-members or simply
C's _ and are coated with zinc to make them rust resistant. They
are also available with prepunched slots so electrical wires and
plumbing lines can be run through.
</P>
<P>
   For load-bearing walls, structural members are available in 16-
to 20-gauge thicknesses. Studs for nonbearing walls are available
in thinner 25-gauge steel. These pieces are lighter in weight,
easier to cut and less expensive than the heavier gauge pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike wood, steel is structurally stable and uniformly
straight. That means that walls, floors and ceilings can be
constructed so they are truly flat, plumb and level. Steel is
moisture-resistant, so it will not dry out and warp nor will it
expand in humid weather. Steel framing is also fireproof and free
from rot and insect infestations.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, steel framing is not significantly less expensive
than traditional dimensional lumber, but representatives of the
steel industry point out that prices are relatively stable, while
lumber costs are rising. In the coming years, it may be more
economical to purchase steel framing.
</P>
<P>
   Does all this mean that wood-framed houses are a thing of the
past? Probably not. Right now about 1 percent of the houses
currently being constructed in the United States have steel
framing. The iron and steel industry hopes to entice more builders
into using steel framing, and they predict that by the end of the
next decade, 25 percent of residential homes will be framed with
steel.
</P>
<P>
   Steel framing, however, has a downside. The biggest drawback to
using steel is that steel is a good conductor of heat. A steel stud
will conduct 10 times more heat than its wooden counterpart. This
means that a warm house can quickly lose much of its heat through
the outside walls if they have steel framing. Extra insulation will
not prevent this, because the heat that enters into steel studs
quickly travels laterally through the framing to the outside of the
house.
</P>
<P>
   Builders try to prevent heat loss by sheathing the outside of
the house with high-density foam board instead of the usual plywood
or particle board. This slows the heat transmission through the
walls, but it has little effect on heat loss through the ceiling.
Manufacturers are designing steel structural members with raised
knobs along the edges that minimize the contact between the
wallboard and the studs. This effectively creates a thin barrier of
air that insulates the stud from interior heat. Other manufacturers
are planning to introduce an insulation tape that can be applied to
the stud before the wallboard is installed.
</P>
<P>
   Another drawback to using steel for construction is that most
professional carpenters are not used to working with it. It's true
that working with steel does not require any arcane skills or even
sophisticated tools; still many carpenters make no secret of the
fact that they would rather work with wood.
</P>
<P>
   With a circular saw, a profession carpenter can quickly cut a
dozen wooden studs to length in less time than it would take to
trim six steel studs with a reciprocating saw or a circular saw
with an abrasive wheel. So the amount of money saved by buying
structural steel may be lost in money spent for increased
construction time, although this is not likely to remain a
significant problem as more builders experiment with steel.

GARDEN QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By LESLIE LAND    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRODUCING FRUIT
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have two espaliered pear trees which have borne excellent
fruit just once in 14 years. They are fertilized in the spring. Is
there something I can do to have fruit more often?
</P>
<P>
   A. Do the trees bloom? They can't make fruit if they don't make
flowers, but if they are blooming well the problem is probably a
lack of cross pollination, said Richard Reisinger, orchard manager
at Cornell University in Ithaca, N.Y., who is himself knee-deep in
pears at the moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are they two different varieties?'' he asked. ``You definitely
need to have that for good crops.'' If they are two different
varieties, he added, the problem may be a lack of bees. If that
describes your situation, you can use a small paintbrush to move
the pollen around yourself.
</P>
<P>
   Alternatively, the difficulty may be cultural. ``People tend to
overfertilize fruit trees,'' Reisinger said, ``and that keeps them
in a juvenile, nonbearing state.'' If the trees are not making many
flowers or are putting out more than 18 inches of new growth a
year, ``you're probably giving them too much fertilizer.''
</P>
<P>
   A third possibility is that you're cutting off the fruiting
spurs when you prune your trees. The short, stubby branchlets that
produce the pears grow on wood that's 2 to 4 years old, so if
you're removing most of each year's growth to keep the trees
looking shapely, you may be removing your potential fruit as well.
</P>
<P>
   WINTERING BRUGMANSIA
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have been growing brugmansia cultivars in containers on my
porch and would like to overwinter them. Given their size, it would
be easiest to store them in a dormant state in an unheated garage.
Is this feasible?
</P>
<P>
   A. In theory, yes. In practice, it's a bit tricky because
brugmansias are fast-growing tropical shrubs that do not have the
slightest natural inclination to go dormant. You have to force them
into it, and they are reluctant to stay there.
</P>
<P>
   The first thing to do is bring them inside _ all but the
lightest brush with freezing temperatures will kill them. Once they
are safe from the weather, begin preparing them for winter by
letting the soil dry out until they start to wilt. Then cut them
back severely, removing roughly half of the top growth and, at
ground level, any stalks that are spindly.
</P>
<P>
   Ideal storage conditions are cold, about 40 degrees, and dark.
The garage will do as long as it doesn't freeze. Just set the
brugmansia pots out of the way (some gardeners lay them on their
sides, which may help keep them dormant and may not). From time to
time, water very sparingly, just enough to keep the soil from
drying to dust. Don't worry when all the leaves fall off.
</P>
<P>
   The brugmansias will probably behave themselves until February
or March. Then they're likely to start growing even though you
haven't done anything to encourage them. There will be flushes of
pale chartreuse, hungry-looking leaves and then almost surely,
aphids. At this point, dormancy is over, and so is life as you have
known it previously.
</P>
<P>
   Bring the plants into a room that gets as much light as
possible. Water and fertilize sparingly, so they don't take over
the whole house, and keep the aphids to a low roar with
insecticidal soap.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as the danger of frost is past, put the brugmansias
outside.
</P>
<P>
   Resume normal watering and fertilization, and they'll be back,
even bigger and more beautiful, in just a couple of weeks.
</P>
<P>
   FUNGUS-FREE COMPOST
</P>
<P>
   Q. By the time the frost killed them, our tomato plants were
almost dead from some kind of blight. Is it OK to put them in the
compost?
</P>
<P>
   A. Gardening doesn't have many rigid rules, but ``keep sick
stuff out of the compost'' is (or should be) one of them. Early
blight, late blight and anthracnose, three of the most common
tomato miseries, are all fungus diseases that winter over on bits
of infected plant debris. Fusarium wilt, a fourth contender in the
gardeners' nemesis sweepstakes, doesn't even need debris to hang
around from year to year.
</P>
<P>
   The tiny spores of these destroyers are likely to be with you
always; you can't completely eradicate them. But you can minimize
their presence by burning affected foliage or sending it to the
landfill. Next year, be sure to mulch under the young plants to
keep fungus spores from splashing up from the soil to the lower
leaves.

WILT CHAMBERLAIN: A COLOSSUS IN MORE WAYS THAN ONE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RAY RATTO  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ ``Bigger than life''' means whatever the user of
the phrase wants it to mean. For me, it was Wilt Chamberlain.
</P>
<P>
   His death Tuesday of what is being called a heart attack caught
most people unprepared because he seemed too big to die.
</P>
<P>
   Chamberlain surely seemed too big to complain about an extensive
dental procedure that most people could endure only with a morphine
drip dispensed from a bicycle pump and a month off from work.
</P>
<P>
   But that was Chamberlain in a nutshell. Nothing he did seemed
real by the normal standards, so his deeds either had to be
dismissed or denied.
</P>
<P>
   Remember the rumor that he didn't actually score 100 points that
night in Hershey, Pa.? Remember the cavalier dismissals of his
sex-with-20,000-women claim (as though anyone would keep track
after, say, 3,500)? Remember how adamantly everyone diminished him
by saying he wasn't better than Bill Russell's Celtics?
</P>
<P>
   Well, he did score 100. How ever many women he bedded, it was a
staggering number. And no, he wasn't better than the best team of
all time.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, who would ask that of a single player? Me, I had my
own standard. A foot and a six-pack of 7-Up.
</P>
<P>
   As a youth, I knew a kid named Brian Joyce whose father had an
in with the Warriors. It wasn't a great in by financial standards,
but it did get Joyce's pals invited to be ball boys when the
Warriors, then based in San Francisco, would play at the Oakland
Auditorium.
</P>
<P>
   The plum job was to work the Warriors' bench. Being barely a
raisin at the time, I was shipped off to the visitors' side, often
to sit upon the basket support with a dust mop to take care of any
excess sweat or lint that would touch the floor, and only
occasionally to work the bench, handing out water and towels to the
players.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, I got to see, at roughly rib-cage level, the centers of
the age _ Gene Wiley, Zelmo Beaty, Walt Bellamy, Connie Dierking,
Reggie Harding, Wesley Unseld. Never Bill Russell; the Celtics
always seemed to play in the city.
</P>
<P>
   Ahh, but Chamberlain. Oakland always got Chamberlain, perhaps
because he had been a Warrior once and was traded to Philadelphia
by Franklin Mieuli for a handful of beads of human form.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, I would be on the basket support when the 76ers would come
out for layups _ Hal Greer, Wally Jones, Chet Walker, Lucious
Jackson, Billy Cunningham, Bill Melchionni, and of course,
Chamberlain. The others laid the ball in gently, the way you never
see these days. Chamberlain dunked.
</P>
<P>
   More than that, he dunked so hard that every time, without fail,
the basket support would tilt forward at least a foot from the
force. I know it was a foot in the pregames because once a
photographer carrying a ruler (for reasons I'm still not sure of to
this day), measured the distance between the back of the support
and the floor and told a compatriot, ``Foot and a half ...
da-a-a-a-mn.''
</P>
<P>
   During games, it had to be more, though I have only the
empirical evidence of once rolling forward off the support after a
Chamberlain dunk and onto the floor, nearly at the feet of Warriors
guard Paul Neumann. The 5,000 or so in attendance got a chuckle out
of it, and were I not already 3 1/2 feet tall, I would have felt
about 3 1/2 feet tall.
</P>
<P>
   The next year the 76ers came to town, I decided it was safer to
work the bench. It also was much cooler because I got to sit at the
end of the bench and have Larry Costello, later a coach in
Milwaukee, condescend to talk to me during lulls in the action.
</P>
<P>
   On the bench, you made sure there was a 6-ounce Dixie cup of
water for everyone except Chamberlain. Chamberlain got a 14-ounce
beer cup full of 7-Up, poured straight from the can. OK, everyone's
got different dietary needs.
</P>
<P>
   But when the players were done with the water, they gave us the
discarded cups, usually with most of the water still unconsumed.
Chamberlain drained his 7-Up every time, during every timeout. A
full can, in a minute, and back for more every time there was a
stoppage.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, he never ran off the floor to go to the bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind the 100 points; the man had kidneys like a
rhinoceros.
</P>
<P>
   As an aside, he also dominated every game he ever played in
Oakland, and that is said even considering Nate Thurmond's
acknowledged greatness as a defensive center. I didn't need to know
his final stats, and it seems wrong now to look them up and pretend
I remembered them. I just remember him moving Thurmond here, there
and all points in between _ and reading the next day how Thurmond
held his own against the great force of his era.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe he did. I don't know. I was 10, and after Chamberlain's
first dunk nearly catapulted me to the free-throw line, I simply
considered myself lucky to be alive.
</P>
<P>
   He must have done this everywhere he played, as well, because he
never said a word in any huddle. He looked at the floor,
occasionally at his coach, and drained that 7-Up.
</P>
<P>
   True, it isn't nearly the grandiose frame of reference some
might have of him, but I know Thurmond never sent me to the floor
in full flail, and I knew he was something else.
</P>
<P>
   Chamberlain, though, was something other than else, and from
sixth grade on, I made it a point to believe every exploit ever
credited to him, even if he was the only one doing the crediting.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The news that there was going to be a fashion show at
Internet World, a computer trade show and geek nirvana in Manhattan
last week, was enough to attract a crowd to Booth 3633 in the
convention hall.
</P>
<P>
   But the people who staked out chairs near the runway an hour
before the show were in for a surprise. Instead of catching a
glimpse of models or fashion celebrities, they were treated to the
spectacle of shaggy-haired men tinkering with circuit boards on a
table littered with cables and electrical tape.
</P>
<P>
   But in one sense, these men (italics)were(end italics) the show,
at least until the models appeared. Three of them were loaded with
gadgets: small plastic display devices were attached to their
eyeglasses, cables hung behind their ears. Each one carried a
two-pound computer with a wireless modem in a black sidepack. A
handheld keypad, called a Twiddler, hung at their sides.
</P>
<P>
   One of the men was Thad Starner, 29, an assistant professor at
the Georgia Institute of Technology who considers himself one of
the first cyborgs. The term, an acronym for cybernetic organism,
refers to a being that is part machine, part human. The cyborgs of
today, who call themselves borgs for short, wear their computers
almost continuously.
</P>
<P>
   Starner had been fully wired since getting dressed that morning.
Having his computer on meant that he could display e-mail messages,
Web pages or digital documents in front of his eyes _ anytime,
anywhere. With the Twiddler, which fits comfortably in one hand, he
can send e-mail and compose letters.
</P>
<P>
   Since December 1996, he has not used a desktop computer. He
wrote his 250-page doctoral thesis using the wearable computer,
typing with the Twiddler while pacing around his sun porch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of a computer at my desk, I have a couch,'' Starner
said. ``That's where I do all my paper writing and problem sets.''
</P>
<P>
   Two other borgs were with him: Josh Weaver, 21, and Rich DeVaul,
28, both students at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The
three of them, accompanied by friends and faculty members, had come
to Internet World to demonstrate the benefits of wearable
computers.
</P>
<P>
   Starner is a co-founder of Infocharms, a company that opened
shop two months ago with the mission of bringing wearable computing
to the marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to showing off new contraptions, company executives
were helping to coordinate a series of high-powered fashion shows
designed to spread the gospel of the borg and to raise money for
Infocharms through corporate sponsorships.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're sick of having to hack together everything we wear,''
Starner said the day before. ``The best of the hobbyists are now
trying to make it mainstream.''
</P>
<P>
   But as visitors to the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center gawked
at Starner's get-up, the question remained: Is the public ready for
wearable computers, for the augmented intelligence, multitasking
and bombardment of information that comes from being constantly
connected to a computer? Are people ready to become borgs?
</P>
<P>
   Researchers like to date the concept of wearable technology to
1268, when the English scientist Roger Bacon wrote about lenses to
improve vision. A more reasonable date would be in the early 1990s,
when technologists like Starner and Steve Mann, now a professor at
the University of Toronto, founded a research group focused on
practical, portable computing devices at the MIT Media Lab.
</P>
<P>
   In the last decade, borg attire has become less obtrusive.
Computers are thinner and more discreet. Some of the first people
researching the devices had to wear bulky display goggles that
obstructed their vision. Now they wear smaller devices that attach
to one side of their eyeglasses.
</P>
<P>
   A few borgs wear displays made of tiny mirrors embedded in their
eyeglass lenses _ with the latest version, tiny screens seem to
hover in the air just in front of their eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Starner, an MIT alumnus, is one of the borgs who is almost never
seen without his ``wearable.'' He even wears it to bed at night,
checking e-mail while his wife sleeps next to him. ``The keyboard
is silent,'' he said. ``There is nothing to wake her up.''
</P>
<P>
   The machine has become part of him, with a few exceptions: ``I
don't sleep with it or shower with it, at least not on purpose,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   For Starner, being a borg means always being wired. He has
constant access to his schedule, his to-do list, papers he is
writing, his e-mail. Last spring, an hour before he was to give his
doctoral defense on wearable computing, he said, he went through a
practice run with his wife.
</P>
<P>
   She offered a suggestion that required changing the entire
structure of his presentation. He was nowhere near a desktop
computer, he said, but he jumped into the challenge as he stood
there, moving text around and writing new paragraphs on his
wearable computer.
</P>
<P>
   Having continual access to a computer and keyboard also means
that borgs are forever multitasking, even while having a
face-to-face conversation. While you are talking to them, they
might be running searches on the Internet or typing in pieces of
the conversation for future reference.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   If two borgs are standing with a group, they may also be
surreptitiously sending each other private messages about the other
people in the group.
</P>
<P>
   To compensate for the constant juggling, borgs have adopted new
forms of social behavior that may seem strange, or even rude, to
non-borgs. At one point during the conference, for example, a
reporter handed DeVaul a business card while DeVaul was in the
middle of a face-to-face conversation with Weaver and a group of
MIT graduates.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, DeVaul looked as though he had lost control of his
eyes, which appeared to be gazing at the ceiling. His left hand was
hanging at his side, but the fingers of that hand were flittering
over his Twiddler as he typed in information from the card he held
in his other hand. His attention, it soon became clear, was focused
on the display screen in front of his right eye.
</P>
<P>
   ``Social cues in society are going to change,'' said Weaver, who
did not seem to be fazed by his friend's behavior. When a fellow
borg is typing on his Twiddler, he said, other borgs have learned
to pause and wait for the information to be recorded.
</P>
<P>
   DeVaul, once he had snapped back into the conversation, said it
was like watching people wearing headphones and listening to a
Walkman, oblivious to their surroundings. Cell phones are another
example. People think nothing of it, Weaver said, when a person's
pocket starts to ring.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the fashion show started that afternoon, hundreds of
people had come to Booth 3633. The plastic chairs were full so most
people stood up, craning their necks as the beats of technomusic
thundered through the exhibit hall.
</P>
<P>
   As the first model strutted out, adorned with a slim device
shaped like a necklace, cameras flashed and a woman's voice boomed
over loudspeakers: ``The Nomadic Radio, voice-activated and
Internet-connected.''
</P>
<P>
   The model was followed by dozens more, each wearing slim,
portable devices. Some were simply concept designs. A few were
actual products, like the wrist-wrapped scanner being used by
United Parcel Service workers on the job, the portable MP3 player
and the waist-worn computer, similar to those used by the borgs at
MIT and Georgia Tech.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, a model in a silvery bikini strode up wearing four
tiny sensory pads that could track her vital signs. As people
pushed in closer to see, DeVaul seemed oblivious. He sat at a table
in the booth, holding a pair of display goggles and fiddling with a
tiny antenna.
</P>
<P>
   The idea for the fashion shows came from another of the
Infocharms co-founders, Katrina Barillova, a former model. Ms.
Barillova came to the United States from what was then
Czechoslovokia, where she had worked as an industrial spy by posing
as a model, wearing listening devices while attending fancy
parties.
</P>
<P>
   She designed and sewed her own dresses, she said, because she
had to find creative ways to hide the devices in her clothes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would hide them in a chest pocket, in my sleeves, my belt,
or in the lining of a jacket,'' Ms. Barillova said.
</P>
<P>
   Fashion shows for wearable computing have been part of the borg
landscape for a few years: the MIT Media Lab ran its first one in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Barillova heard about the shows and wanted to take them to
the next level. She reasoned that if wearable computers became
associated with glamour, people might be persuaded to try them out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever they see celebrities or models wearing, they have to
have,'' Ms. Barillova said.
</P>
<P>
   For Infocharms, the fashion shows have proved to be a success.
Alex Lightman, the company's president, said sponsorships had
brought in about $700,000 in cash and advertising swaps.
</P>
<P>
   After the show, part of the crowd moved to the booth's tables to
see some of the gadgets that are in development. DeVaul
demonstrated how people could wear display devices and enhanced
name tags to exchange information with people. An enhanced name tag
displays information about the person when viewed through the
devices.
</P>
<P>
   As Weaver and several MIT professors showed other gadgets
displayed on the tables, Starner, still wearing his computer, was
talking to people in the crowd. Although he spoke enthusiastically
about being constantly connected, the location of the fashion show
was a problem for the borgs.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit hall was in the basement of the Javits Center, where
a clear wireless cellular connection was impossible, so Starner was
not able to get access to his e-mail or scan the Web. To make
things worse, he was also beta-testing a different portable
computer, one that did not include the same information he had
stored on his personal hard drive.
</P>
<P>
   Late in the afternoon, someone asked Starner for the name of a
researcher. Because he could not electronically scan his notes, he
was forced to rely on his human memory. He was able to recall the
name, but he looked distressed at being without his connection.
``Today I'm not myself,'' he said.

WILT CHAMBERLAIN: A COLOSSUS IN MORE WAYS THAN ONE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RAY RATTO  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ ``Bigger than life''' means whatever the user of
the phrase wants it to mean. For me, it was Wilt Chamberlain.
</P>
<P>
   His death Tuesday of what is being called a heart attack caught
most people unprepared because he seemed too big to die.
</P>
<P>
   Chamberlain surely seemed too big to complain about an extensive
dental procedure that most people could endure only with a morphine
drip dispensed from a bicycle pump and a month off from work.
</P>
<P>
   But that was Chamberlain in a nutshell. Nothing he did seemed
real by the normal standards, so his deeds either had to be
dismissed or denied.
</P>
<P>
   Remember the rumor that he didn't actually score 100 points that
night in Hershey, Pa.? Remember the cavalier dismissals of his
sex-with-20,000-women claim (as though anyone would keep track
after, say, 3,500)? Remember how adamantly everyone diminished him
by saying he wasn't better than Bill Russell's Celtics?
</P>
<P>
   Well, he did score 100. How ever many women he bedded, it was a
staggering number. And no, he wasn't better than the best team of
all time.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, who would ask that of a single player? Me, I had my
own standard. A foot and a six-pack of 7-Up.
</P>
<P>
   As a youth, I knew a kid named Brian Joyce whose father had an
in with the Warriors. It wasn't a great in by financial standards,
but it did get Joyce's pals invited to be ball boys when the
Warriors, then based in San Francisco, would play at the Oakland
Auditorium.
</P>
<P>
   The plum job was to work the Warriors' bench. Being barely a
raisin at the time, I was shipped off to the visitors' side, often
to sit upon the basket support with a dust mop to take care of any
excess sweat or lint that would touch the floor, and only
occasionally to work the bench, handing out water and towels to the
players.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, I got to see, at roughly rib-cage level, the centers of
the age _ Gene Wiley, Zelmo Beaty, Walt Bellamy, Connie Dierking,
Reggie Harding, Wesley Unseld. Never Bill Russell; the Celtics
always seemed to play in the city.
</P>
<P>
   Ahh, but Chamberlain. Oakland always got Chamberlain, perhaps
because he had been a Warrior once and was traded to Philadelphia
by Franklin Mieuli for a handful of beads of human form.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, I would be on the basket support when the 76ers would come
out for layups _ Hal Greer, Wally Jones, Chet Walker, Lucious
Jackson, Billy Cunningham, Bill Melchionni, and of course,
Chamberlain. The others laid the ball in gently, the way you never
see these days. Chamberlain dunked.
</P>
<P>
   More than that, he dunked so hard that every time, without fail,
the basket support would tilt forward at least a foot from the
force. I know it was a foot in the pregames because once a
photographer carrying a ruler (for reasons I'm still not sure of to
this day), measured the distance between the back of the support
and the floor and told a compatriot, ``Foot and a half ...
da-a-a-a-mn.''
</P>
<P>
   During games, it had to be more, though I have only the
empirical evidence of once rolling forward off the support after a
Chamberlain dunk and onto the floor, nearly at the feet of Warriors
guard Paul Neumann. The 5,000 or so in attendance got a chuckle out
of it, and were I not already 3 1/2 feet tall, I would have felt
about 3 1/2 feet tall.
</P>
<P>
   The next year the 76ers came to town, I decided it was safer to
work the bench. It also was much cooler because I got to sit at the
end of the bench and have Larry Costello, later a coach in
Milwaukee, condescend to talk to me during lulls in the action.
</P>
<P>
   On the bench, you made sure there was a 6-ounce Dixie cup of
water for everyone except Chamberlain. Chamberlain got a 14-ounce
beer cup full of 7-Up, poured straight from the can. OK, everyone's
got different dietary needs.
</P>
<P>
   But when the players were done with the water, they gave us the
discarded cups, usually with most of the water still unconsumed.
Chamberlain drained his 7-Up every time, during every timeout. A
full can, in a minute, and back for more every time there was a
stoppage.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, he never ran off the floor to go to the bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind the 100 points; the man had kidneys like a
rhinoceros.
</P>
<P>
   As an aside, he also dominated every game he ever played in
Oakland, and that is said even considering Nate Thurmond's
acknowledged greatness as a defensive center. I didn't need to know
his final stats, and it seems wrong now to look them up and pretend
I remembered them. I just remember him moving Thurmond here, there
and all points in between _ and reading the next day how Thurmond
held his own against the great force of his era.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe he did. I don't know. I was 10, and after Chamberlain's
first dunk nearly catapulted me to the free-throw line, I simply
considered myself lucky to be alive.
</P>
<P>
   He must have done this everywhere he played, as well, because he
never said a word in any huddle. He looked at the floor,
occasionally at his coach, and drained that 7-Up.
</P>
<P>
   True, it isn't nearly the grandiose frame of reference some
might have of him, but I know Thurmond never sent me to the floor
in full flail, and I knew he was something else.
</P>
<P>
   Chamberlain, though, was something other than else, and from
sixth grade on, I made it a point to believe every exploit ever
credited to him, even if he was the only one doing the crediting.

EMPLOYMENT SITES PUT PROFESSIONAL WORKERS UP FOR AUCTION 
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Mass., Calif.) (th) 
 By DEBORAH BRANSCUM    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Free agents. Free-lancers. Solopreneurs. Whatever they are
called, people working for themselves in American businesses form a
large part of the labor force.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Department of Labor estimates that 7.5 million people,
or roughly one in every 16 workers, are self-employed independent
contractors, hired by companies on a contract basis, often for a
short term.
</P>
<P>
   All those independent contractors have created a booming market
in Web sites that cater to them. Sites like Free Agent
(freeagent.com), Monster Talent Market (www.monster.com) and
Aquent's Talent Finder (talentfinder.aquent.com), and two that will
begin later in the fall, Guru.com and ICPlanet.com, hope to appeal
to self-employed professionals with a mix of job opportunities,
advice and services.
</P>
<P>
   Aquent, Monster.com and ICPlanet.com expect to profit by
charging companies who are seeking short-term talent. Many of the
sites want contractors to pay as well, not for services that match
them with companies, but for additional benefits like group-rate
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American dream is to be your own boss, not necessarily to
run your own business,'' said Carlos Cashman, president of Opus360
Corp., which put Free Agent online in July. The company has taken a
novel approach to attracting customers by offering them the option
of becoming employees of Free Agent.
</P>
<P>
   Contractors who sign up for the $249 monthly plan continue to
accept work from companies, but Free Agent handles the billing,
receives payments, and then pays the contractor after deducting for
taxes, retirement and insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Terri Lonier, an author and consultant who runs the Working Solo
site, a resource for independent professionals, predicts that
plenty of contractors will sign up for sites like Free Agent
``because in our Web survey they point out that one of the things
that's most challenging for them is finding new work.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Especially challenging is finding new work while they're doing
the current work,'' Ms. Lonier continued. ``What's going to be
telling is how many people will actually be on the buying side.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus far that doesn't appear to be a huge number. In
mid-September, for example, Free Agent appeared to have only 27
listings for companies seeking professional help on projects. Most
were related to technology, although the single listing in the
entertainment category offered one lucky professional the
opportunity to direct the shooting of a feature film in Portugal.
</P>
<P>
   Monster's Talent Market has 70,000 registered contractors and
about 5,000 registered employers, according to Jeff Taylor, chief
executive of TMP Interactive, parent company of the Monster.com
career site.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 15, the Talent Market cited the number of its ongoing
auctions at 20,000. No figures were available for the number of
contractors who had actually received bids for their services, but
a search for advertising, public relations and communications
professionals using the keyword ``technology'' found no bids within
the first 100 auctions.
</P>
<P>
   Monster.com, which is based in Maynard, Mass., went online with
Talent Market in July as a kind of Ebay for human beings. There
have been more than 3,000 bids in the system since it began, Taylor
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have enough bids _ I've been pretty open with job
seekers about it _ but there are more bids every day,'' said
Taylor, who added that Monster.com is profitable.
</P>
<P>
   Even though contractors heavily outnumber employers on these
sites, matches do get made. Hani Durzy read about the Monster
Talent Market and went there for public relations help when he was
unable to find a contractor through word of mouth.
</P>
<P>
   In the real world, as director of corporate communications for
Chipshot.com, a online custom golf club business based in
Sunnyvale, Calif., Durzy competes with a slew of other Internet
companies for consultants. But online he found plenty of public
relations professionals in his area, and no competing bidders.
</P>
<P>
   Durzy didn't hire his consultant by completing a Talent Market
auction. Instead he placed an initial bid for services, and then
used e-mail to arrange a job interview with the contractor he
eventually hired, Benita Kenn, of Menlo Park, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this market especially, where it's so hard to hire good,
experienced people, you really don't have any idea what you're
getting unless you meet them,'' said Durzy, who wanted to make sure
the consultant would fit in well at the company.
</P>
<P>
   Such queasiness about hiring contractors sight unseen led
Aquent, which is based in Boston, to try a different approach.
Independent professionals who want to register with the site's
``talent agency'' must submit their resumes and then are
interviewed by Aquent representatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're the only company that can actually meet the talent and
meet the clients and test and screen for skills, so the quality of
matches is much higher,'' said John Chuang, Aquent's co-founder and
chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Aquent's strategy is based on its 11-year history as an
international employment service, formerly called Mac Temps, that
places 12,000 professionals annually.
</P>
<P>
   Aquent offers several services for contractors, including free
listing through its Talent Finder search engine, which was unveiled
last month, and Fast Cash, a program in which contractors submit
their invoices to Aquent, which pays them immediately for a 5
percent fee, instead of the workers having to wait for payment
directly from the employers.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kenn, the public relations consultant who began working for
Durzy under a part-time contract this summer, isn't willing to
trust Aquent or Free Agent with her invoices just yet. And she
hasn't received any other nibbles from her Monster.com auctions.
Even so, she is upbeat about the sites that cater to people like
her.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing you've got to lose is the time you spend
putting your information online,'' she said.

WHERE THE WILDEBEEST ROAM, ON CD-ROM 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By LES LINE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Serengeti: a magical name that is synonymous with primeval
Africa and evokes indelible images of one of the greatest wildlife
spectacles on Earth _ unless, of course, you never watch the nature
programs on television. The word springs from the Masai language
and means ``an extended place.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the world-famous Serengeti National Park in Tanzania
covers 5,700 square miles of grassy plains that are broken here and
there by granite islands called kopjes, savannahs that are lightly
cloaked with thorn trees, saline lakes where flamingos feed on
minute organisms, and other habitats, all with their own unique
animal populations.
</P>
<P>
   But like Yellowstone in North America, the park is incomplete.
The whole Serengeti ecosystem, as defined by the migration route of
a million ox-like antelope called wildebeests (gnus to crossword
puzzle fans), is the size of the country of Kuwait and extends into
the Masai Mara Game Reserve just across the Kenyan border.
</P>
<P>
   It seems odd, then, that ``Nature: Virtual Serengeti,'' a CD-ROM
spinoff from the PBS television program, never sets foot in
Tanzania. All of its action takes place in Kenya, much of it at
sites far beyond the Serengeti, like Lake Nakuru.
</P>
<P>
   And while some of the five dozen video clips are truly exciting
_ I'm thinking in particular of 35 seconds that show a cheetah
running down a Thomson's gazelle or a scene of crocodiles tearing
into a hapless zebra _ they largely fail to convey the vastness of
the Serengeti, the role of the animals in their respective
habitats, and especially the huge movement in the dry season.
</P>
<P>
   That is when immense wildebeest herds, trailed by predatory
lions, cheetahs and African wild dogs and scavenging hyenas, trek
north to find green pastures beyond the park boundary. Some of the
videos, in fact, add little more than still photographs.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps I'm expecting too much from a program billed as ``the
first photo safari for kids.'' Certainly I'm spoiled by having seen
a broad representation of African wildlife in real time in the
lesser-known parks of South Africa's Natal province.
</P>
<P>
   But after spending several hours with Virtual Serengeti _ and a
lot of it was fun, I admit _ I came away feeling that the producers
missed the chance to convey the Serengeti's big picture to young
naturalists.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, it took considerable effort to join Nature's host,
George Page, and an elusive Serengeti field scientist, Dr. Elgin
Carp, at Camp Mara, first stop on the electronic safari: Virtual
Serengeti wouldn't run on my high-end Pentium II computer,
apparently because the Quick Time movie viewer that it installed on
the hard drive was incompatible with an existing version from
another CD-ROM program.
</P>
<P>
   I spent an hour on the phone with a willing help-line technician
at Grolier Interactive, the publisher, but succeeded only in
disabling another much-used program that needed Quick Time.
</P>
<P>
   So I moved upstairs to my wife's low-end computer, where Virtual
Serengeti and Quick Time installed without difficulty, and I was
promptly told to change the display settings. That done, I
reinserted the CD.
</P>
<P>
   An elephant trumpeted into view, Page read a letter to Carp
about the big research and filmmaking project in which I was about
to participate, my passport was stamped, and I was flown to the
first of six study sites and dropped off at the airstrip. In the
process, Page's voice-over breezed through instructions for using
the mouse to explore the area, find hidden animals and fill in a
journal with my discoveries.
</P>
<P>
   Whoa, George! Where's the manual? There isn't one. Where's the
Help button? None in sight. In addition to the video screen, there
are five objects on the desktop: a compass that brings up a 3-D map
of the present site, a journal, a video camera, a field guide and
your passport. If you stumble around and eventually open the field
guide, you will find help _ but there is no way to print out the
pages for reference.
</P>
<P>
   Once you are comfortable with the controls, however, the Virtual
Safari interface is nifty. On the map of Camp Mara, for example,
there is a red ring where the airplane is parked. Several more
rings are spaced along the track to your tent.
</P>
<P>
   As you progress along the trail, each ring or ``node'' turns
red, offering a 360-degree, three-dimensional photof your
surroundings _ and by holding down the left mouse button, you can
search for animals while turning in a complete circle.
</P>
<P>
   You are able to zoom into the picture, look up at the sky or
look down toward your feet. If there is an animal nearby, you will
hear its sounds _ the grunting of a warthog, the roar of a lion _
and the cursor will turn into a box. A mouse click will open a
video _ some of them are as short as five seconds _ with a brief
caption, like ``The caracal can jump up and snatch a bird right out
of the air.''
</P>
<P>
   And when you reach the last ring, your tent, you can push
through the flap and move around inside, where there is a laptop
computer on the desk ready to connect to the Nature Web site. Neat.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to discover and shoot videos of all the animals at
each of the camp sites and use the images and information you have
collected to complete Carp's studies about animal fashion (the
leopard's spots or zebra's stripes, for example), body parts (an
elephant's trunk) and other topics. But you're on your own. The
scientist keeps leaving e-mail messages saying that he is unable to
join you for one reason or another.
</P>
<P>
   Ready to move on to a new place? Hop in the Land Rover or the
cockpit of your plane, pull up a map of southern Kenya and choose
your destination. The reward for finishing the studies is a hot-air
balloon ride over the Masai Mara. I didn't get that far on my first
trip, but I'll be back.
</P>
<P>
   As George Page says, ``Safari enjema,'' which is Masai for
``Have a good safari.''

   (Circuits)  
(jt) 
 By PETER H. LEWIS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is hardly news when a computer product is released with bugs
in it, but it is rare indeed when the bugs are the cause of so much
delight. The bugs _ in this case a fruit fly and a plant louse,
both long deceased _ come in the box with the new Intel Play QXE
Computer Microscope, along with an assortment of other tiny,
slide-mounted specimens including algae, plant spores, a hair of
the dog and even the bee's knees.
</P>
<P>
   Although it is made by the toy giant Mattel and packaged as a
toy, the QX3 microscope ($99.95) is serious fun. The brains behind
the microscope are provided by the Intel Corp., which knows a thing
or two about computers. Together, Intel and Mattel have created a
new microscope for the digital age, one that goes far beyond the
capabilities of the beginner microscopes through which many of us
first glimpsed the hidden beauty of the microscopic world.
</P>
<P>
   The QX3 attaches to any Windows computer that has a USB
(Universal Serial Bus) peripheral connection port, which includes
almost all PC's made in the last 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   With three magnification settings of 10X, 60X and 200X, the QX3
microscope does not have the higher resolution or precision
controls of many classroom microscopes, which typically offer 400X
or higher magnification. It is closer to a toy than to a scientific
instrument, built from plastic _ translucent blue, of course, which
is de rigueur these days _ instead of heavy-duty metal, with a
crude focusing mechanism that lacks the precision of most
microscopes.
</P>
<P>
   But it does things that no ordinary microscope can do, like make
movies.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of the traditional eyepiece through which generations of
young scientists have squinted, the QX3 has a small digital video
camera. It transmits what it sees over the USB con to the
computer, and the images are displayed on the computer screen in a
window created by the special software that comes on a CD-ROM disk
with the microscope.
</P>
<P>
   All around the viewing window are simple, one-click software
buttons that let the user control the microscope and manipulate the
images.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing something of interest, the microscopist can simply click
the mouse to capture still images or video clips of whatever is
being examined. The images are stored as standard graphics or video
files on the computer and can be inserted into school reports, sent
to friends as e-mail attachments or even transmitted to a Web page,
depending on the ambitiousness and technical sophistication of the
user.
</P>
<P>
   The user can also detach the microscope from its base and,
within the six-foot range of the USB cable, roam around capturing
close-up images of specimens that might not otherwise fit on the
microscope's stage, like one's own head, a piece of cheese, a
teacher's tattoo or any sort of disgusting, unidentified object one
finds and wants to share with others at 60X or 200X. Even at 10X,
the human body becomes an endless source of amazement: sweating
skin, hair, blinking eyes, scars, teeth, scabs, warts,
fingerprints, tongues and even uvulas.
</P>
<P>
   The software enables children to combine the microscopic images
with scanned artwork and pictures taken with a digital camera. For
example, a student might wish to conduct a scientific experiment to
see what his sister's face would look like attached to the body of
a blood-sucking tick.
</P>
<P>
   The software is exceptionally simple to operate, with built-in
audio help for those of us who have a phobia about software
manuals. The unusual sound effects that are triggered when a button
is highlighted are amusing at first, but grow old quickly.
</P>
<P>
   One important issue that bears close-up examination, however, is
Intel's apparent insensitivity to customer privacy. The CD-ROM
set-up program that Mattel and Intel designed for the QX3
microscope asks for the name, age, sex and e-mail address of the
user. Then it gathers detailed technical information about the
computer and sends it all back to Intel automatically as part of
the online product registration procedure, unless the user clicks a
special box denying Intel the data.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Intel automatically signs the user up for ``special
offers or other information'' unless he or she clicks a small
button instructing Mattel and Intel not to send it. This is called
``opt out'' marketing, and it is disturbing even when aimed at
adults. On a product specifically aimed at children, as this one
is, the only acceptable practice is to make protection of privacy
the default value and ``opt in'' the alternative.
</P>
<P>
   Another gripe: The QX3 comes in a package that is a masterpiece
of vexation. To get the microscope out of its box, I was forced to
hack, shred, tear and mangle the packaging into nearly microscopic
bits. But all was forgiven when the microscope lit up and
displayed, with exquisite intimacy, all of the bugs it came with.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, there is nothing even remotely cute about a
bee's knees at 60X magnification.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is there anything cute about the computer I used to test the
QX3 microscope, the new Astro all-in-one computer from Gateway.
</P>
<P>
   The Astro is an Apple iMac wannabe, an all-in-one design that
combines the computer and a 15-inch monitor in one tubby unit. The
$799 Astro, which goes on sale October 14 at www.gateway.com, was
designed for novice PC users and for people with tight budgets. It
is very easy to set up once it is hoisted from its box. Gateway is
also touting the Astro as a second PC for households that already
have one. Unlike the colorful iMac and its other clones, the Astro
is a colorless (well, beige) system that is also about as beige
technologically as one can get these days. It is built around a
400-megahertz Intel Celeron microprocessor and the Microsoft
Windows 98 operating system, with 64 megabytes of RAM, a
4.3-gigabyte hard disk drive, a 56K (V90) modem, a diskette drive
and a CD-ROM drive. It has a pair of built-in speakers and a
microphone, and a pair of USB connection ports.
</P>
<P>
   That is it. The system cannot be upgraded except through the USB
ports. Gateway designed the Astro as a closed box, so there is no
way to open the case to add expansion cards or more memory. To
network the Astro with another computer, for example, you would
have to use a USB connection like Intel's Anypoint USB ($89).
</P>
<P>
   The unit I tested came with Windows 98. Gateway says the Astro
will come with Microsoft Works 99 Suite, Encarta and Money,
although those programs were not included in the unit I tested.
Unlike other Gateway computers, the Astro does not come with a free
year of Internet access through Gateway.net. That costs $14.95 a
month extra, or $129 a year paid in advance. The system comes with
a 12-month warranty, 12 months of free telephone hardware support
and 3 months of software support.
</P>
<P>
   The Astro's direct competitors are the eMachine eOne and the
Apple iMac, and by those measures the new Gateway machine is
something of a dis-Astro. Both the eOne ($799) and the new iMac
($999) have superior technical specifications, and they are better
looking, too.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, some people may appreciate a computer that is not blue.
But the Astro is exceptionally large and ungainly, 45 pounds not
counting the peripherals. That's a full 10 pounds heavier than the
iMac.
</P>
<P>
   In short, the Astro is the sort of computer the Klingons would
have built if they had somehow captured the secret blueprints for
the iMac.

   Cleaning Up Leftovers
</P>
<P>
   Q. Since I deleted programs I do not use, I get the following
error message every time I turn on the computer: ``Error Starting
Program. A required .DLL file, WBHOOK32.DLL, was not found.'' Is
there anything I can do to get rid of this message permanently?
</P>
<P>
   A. ``.DLL'' designates dynamic-link library files, which contain
data or a collection of functions that are used by Windows
programs. Some D.L.L. files are written just for the system or a
particular application installed on your computer. But some are
used by several different programs. If you delete or overwrite a
D.L.L. file when adding or uninstalling software, other programs on
your machine may not function properly.
</P>
<P>
   When you manually delete a program from your hard drive, pieces
of it are sometimes left behind. These leftovers may cause problems
with your system when they start to look for the parts of the
program that you deleted. Using the -Add/Remove option in your
computer's Control Panel or third-party software designed to
uninstall programs completely can help prevent these types of
problems. Two popular programs that offer to help you safely remove
old programs from your PC are Uninstaller by McAfee and Norton
Cleansweep 2000, made by Symantec.
</P>
<P>
   A Microsoft representative confirmed that WBHOOK32.DLL was not
one of the Windows systems files and was probably from one of the
programs you deleted. One way to get rid of the error would be to
reinstall the deleted programs, then remove them with the
-Add/Remove utility.

BUSH TO PLAY YANKEE TO CHALLENGERS? (For use by NYTimes News
Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Yankees made short work of the Texas Rangers in
last week's divisional baseball playoff. Having thereby dispensed
with the formality of eliminating our hometown heroes, New York
Manager Joe Torre revealed that he was rooting for the Boston Red
Sox and Cleveland Indians to wear each other out in the remaining
games of their playoff series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that whoever wins is exhausted,'' Torre said after
mowing down the local team Saturday night at The Ballpark in
Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   After sweeping three games from the Rangers without breaking a
sweat, Torre and his Yankees were no doubt thrilled when the
Boston-Cleveland shootout went the full five games. Better yet, the
last two games of the series were slugfests in which the eventual
winner, Boston, scored 35 runs in approximately 27 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the Red Sox weren't exhausted after all that base-running,
but there's no way they'll be as fresh as the Yankees when the
archrivals collide in the American League Championship Series
beginning tonight.
</P>
<P>
   The script played out exactly as if Torre had written it.
</P>
<P>
   And as often happens in this sports-crazed country, the baseball
season has provided a fitting analogy for the political season.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush, former baseball magnate and current
front-runner for the Republican Party's 2000 presidential
nomination, appears to be benefiting from a campaign story line
that parallels the American League playoffs: While Bush breezes
through the campaign with no serious threat being mounted by any of
his numerous opponents, Democratic front-runner Al Gore finds
himself in a dogfight with ex-basketball star and former New Jersey
Sen. Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   The upside of a difficult playoff ... er ... primary campaign is
that it can push a candidate to find out what he's made of; it can
toughen the winner for the battle ahead. The downside is that the
primaries can take such a toll in campaign cash and unfavorable
publicity that the survivor is doomed to defeat in the general
election.
</P>
<P>
   The first primaries are months away, of course, and Bush could
hit some bumps in the road en route to the Republican nomination.
But he figures to crush his Republican opponents as easily as the
Yankees crushed the Arlington baseball team that Bush once
commanded as managing general partner.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Bradley figure to fight it out until the final inning.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to the new USA Today/CNN/Gallup Poll showing
that Bradley continues to gain ground on Gore and that Bush
continues to thrash them both in head-to-head matchups.
</P>
<P>
   The poll also reaffirmed Bush's runaway front-runner status in
the GOP race. The Texas governor was the choice of 60 percent of
Republicans; runner-up Elizabeth Dole managed just 11 percent.
Other candidates trudged along in single digits.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is on such a roll, in fact, that even his controversial
criticism of his own party and party leaders in Congress worked to
his benefit. According to USA Today, 55 percent of Republicans
polled said that they support Bush vs. Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's suggestion that the GOP needs to show more compassion
apparently touched a chord: USA Today reported that 64 percent of
poll respondents said ``the Republican Party has not been
compassionate enough about the needs of the poor.''
</P>
<P>
   Those poll results must be hard to swallow for the anti-Bush
crowd. Rather than stumbling, as his detractors keep predicting (or
rather hoping?), Bush seems to be getting stronger as he goes
along.
</P>
<P>
   Start practicing, Bush-haters. Say it again and again until you
get used to it: ``President Bush, President Bush, President Bush
...''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, meanwhile, need to start choosing sides in the
Gore-Bradley clash. The sooner they make up their minds, the sooner
the potentially destructive contest will be decided _ and the
sooner the Democratic nominee-in-waiting can starting for
the electoral World Series against Bush.
</P>
<P>
   As if all the preparation in the world will make any difference.
</P>

ONLINE RESERVATION SYSTEMS SHAKE UP TRAVEL AGENT BUSINESS
</HEADLINE>
  (Duplication notice: Also moving in `t' category.) 
 ( nk ) 
 By JOE SHARKEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; To a visitor, Los Angeles can seem like Queens with dazzling
sunlight _ a vast, bewildering, high-density commercial and
residential expanse where navigation is aided by the fact that the
buildings are low enough to allow you to spot the topographical
landmarks and aim the car at least at a known point on the compass.
</P>
<P>
   That's the Los Angeles most tourists know, and finding a
suitable hotel there is a cinch. But the Los Angeles where many
business travelers end up _ downtown, off in the east-central part
of the city _ is a very different place where giant glass
skyscrapers cluster, as if for security, on high ground above a
derelict business district that hasn't seen good times since Harlow
was an ingenue.
</P>
<P>
   Here, the streets are dark and eerily empty at night and it's a
long way to Beverly Hills or Westwood. As a consequence, choosing
from among the many good downtown hotels becomes a little more
personal, since you're more likely to be confined to quarters
longer and dependent on the hotel's individual services and
characteristics. To nut-shell the point, as they say on the other
side of town: here you want to choose your hotel deliberately, and
not on some vague recommendation from a travel agent.
</P>
<P>
   So in making arrangements for a business trip that required a
four-night stay in downtown Los Angeles last week, I tried out
Travelocity. That service is about to surpass Expedia from
Microsoft's as the largest Internet travel-booking service after
its parent, Sabre Group, completes plans to spin it off into a
separate publicly traded company. Sabre is the reservation system
controlled by AMR, which also owns American Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   The site (travelocity.com) was easy to use, if you paid
attention. I was pretty specific about what I wanted for a stay
during which both my wife and I would be conducting separate
business. No convention hotels. No brassy 1,500-room joints with
soaring atriums and splashing fountains. No venerable old hotels
with elaborate public spaces downstairs and rooms upstairs that
evoke the YMCA.
</P>
<P>
   Within 15 minutes on line at Travelocity, I had evaluated more
than a dozen hotels and booked what turned out to be an excellent
choice, the Wyndham Checkers, a small luxury hotel with gloriously
quiet rooms, large marble bathrooms, impeccable service (you can
specify which newspapers you want left at your door, if you don't
choose to have the ubiquitous USA Today foisted on you first thing
in the morning), and jiffy-fast valet parking. The online price:
$209 a night, slightly below the rack rate and competitive with
other quality hotels in the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   While booking it, I felt as if I was in control to a degree that
I'd never been while selecting a hotel in an unfamiliar location.
The Travelocity site provided accurate data and _ this is
important, in the endless galaxy of Web travel hype coming from who
knows where _ credible information, including customer evaluations
from the trusted Zagat survey
</P>
<P>
   Could a travel agent have arranged the same thing to my
specifications? Possibly, but only if I were a preferred customer
deserving of a lot of time and attention. What does this say to the
travel-agent business? It says, stand by for heavy rolls, mates.
</P>
<P>
   After a fitful start, the online travel marketplace is finding
firm footing as people become adept at using the Internet and as
personal computers achieve greater household penetration. They're
in 38.8 percent of United States households this year, three times
the figure of 1995, according to Forrester Research Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer fears about online credit card security have been the
biggest bugaboo for the rapidly expanding Internet travel industry,
but this is changing. In surveys, Forrester Research found that 53
percent of online respondents last July said they felt secure using
credit cards on the Internet, up from 15 percent in early 1998.
Among those who don't use the Internet, however, there is
overwhelming distrust of the idea of online credit card purchases.
</P>
<P>
   Industry officials believe that smart customers, including
business travelers who book their own trips, will increasingly take
their business to online booking sites. Within two years, the
industry ``will be generating about $20 billion in sales,'' said
Phillip C. Wolf, president and chief executive of PhoCusWright, an
online travel industry research company.
</P>
<P>
   Travel sites like Travelocity and Expedia that establish
themselves as trusted brands will dominate this new market and
furiously shake the foundations of the traditional travel agency
business, industry experts believe. The competition could become
fierce, too. Earlier this month, one of the most aggressive
American retail giants said that it was developing its own online
travel site for booking airline tickets, rental cars and hotels.
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart is the name.

I'd never been while selecting a hotel in an unfamiliar location.
The Travelocity site provided accurate data and _ this is
important, in the endless galaxy of Web travel hype coming from who
knows where _ credible information, including customer evaluations
from the trusted Zagat survey
</P>
<P>
   Could a travel agent have arranged the same thing to my
specifications? Possibly, but only if I were a preferred customer
deserving of a lot of time and attention. What does this say to the
travel-agent business? It says, stand by for heavy rolls, mates.
</P>
<P>
   After a fitful start, the online travel marketplace is finding
firm footing as people become adept at using the Internet and as
personal computers achieve greater household penetration. They're
in 38.8 percent of United States households this year, three times
the figure of 1995, according to Forrester Research Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer fears about online credit card security have been the
biggest bugaboo for the rapidly expanding Internet travel industry,
but this is changing. In surveys, Forrester Research found that 53
percent of online respondents last July said they felt secure using
credit cards on the Internet, up from 15 percent in early 1998.
Among those who don't use the Internet, however, there is
overwhelming distrust of the idea of online credit card purchases.
</P>
<P>
   Industry officials believe that smart customers, including
business travelers who book their own trips, will increasingly take
their business to online booking sites. Within two years, the
industry ``will be generating about $20 billion in sales,'' said
Phillip C. Wolf, president and chief executive of PhoCusWright, an
online travel industry research company.
</P>
<P>
   Travel sites like Travelocity and Expedia that establish
themselves as trusted brands will dominate this new market and
furiously shake the foundations of the traditional travel agency
business, industry experts believe. The competition could become
fierce, too. Earlier this month, one of the most aggressive
American retail giants said that it was developing its own online
travel site for booking airline tickets, rental cars and hotels.
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart is the name.

`SENSATION' FLURRY OBSCURES THE ART 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By PATRICIA C. JOHNSON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Visitors enter the Brooklyn Museum of Art to view
``Sensation`` through an incongruous facade, painted like King
Tutankhamen's famous golden mask.
</P>
<P>
   Yet amusement dissipates quickly when they are required to pass
through metal detectors and have their bags inspected _ safety
measures necessitated by the strident battle over this exhibition
of contemporary British art.
</P>
<P>
   With the possible exception of the museum guards who are
collecting overtime pay, no one wins in the battle of
``Sensation.''
</P>
<P>
   Not New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who, acting like a
petulant Third World dictator, inflamed a controversy over the
exhibit without having seen it.
</P>
<P>
   Not Brooklyn Museum of Art director Arnold Lehman and his
publicity machine, whose deliberately provocative bid for attention
was transparent _ and backfired, terribly.
</P>
<P>
   Not the distinguished museum, with its enviable collection of
Egyptian art and works on paper, as it slides into a legal mud
fight.
</P>
<P>
   Not the artists, at least not in the long run.
</P>
<P>
   The losers also include taxpayers, New Yorkers as well as
tourists. The hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal costs
incurred by both litigants _ the museum asserting its right to
exhibit the art under the First Amendment and the city claiming the
First Amendment does not protect public subsidies of free speech,
even threatening to evict the museum from the city-owned building _
ultimately come from public coffers. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; The audience loses too, for the flurry of heated words blurs
the eyes, numbs the ears and the mind. Because it is words, not
art, that provoked this conflagration.
</P>
<P>
   Ninety works by 42 artists compose ``Sensation: Young British
Artists from the Saatchi Collection.'' All belong to Charles
Saatchi, an advertising mogul whose success in business depends on
his talent for using the right combination of words and images to
sell his clients' products to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Without the avalanche of words that preceded and now surround
this exhibit, the art itself, visceral as it is at times, is mostly
self-indulgent. Little of it is new to 20th-century art. Further,
many of the same artists and several of the same pieces were
included in ``Brilliant!,`` a show of young British artists at
Houston's Contemporary Arts Museum three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the unfortunate icon of this exhibition, Chris Ofili's
``The Holy Virgin Mary.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a mixed-media work that includes elephant dung, a material
that has been interpreted as being disrespectful and desecrating to
a holy image. But some African cultures have long used materials
like animal dung and blood to create objects of worship; neither
desecration nor insult was the intent. Further, Ofili, a Catholic
of Nigerian descent living in London, molded and shellacked the
lumpy forms, then applied jewellike beads of paint with the
meticulous care associated with a reverential process.
</P>
<P>
   For the rest, the so-called ``pornographic'' cutouts decorating
the golden background of the Virgin's image don't show a sex act.
It seems they refer instead to the anatomy of fertility and
regeneration.
</P>
<P>
   But no matter how we probe, analyze and talk about it, this work
is a lame picture. Divorced from the false heat created around it,
it's not nearly as effectively decorative and texturally
interesting as another Ofili work on view, an abstract
constellation of paint beads and (yes) decorated dung.
</P>
<P>
   Why Damien Hirst's animal sculptures should cause an uproar so
late in the century is puzzling. The dissection and preservation of
animals in formaldehyde are time-honored scientific processes.
Though many critics have defended the sliced cow, halved pig and
the shark, all suspended in formaldehyde-filled tanks, as
commentaries or extensions of minimalist aesthetics and therefore
appropriate in the context of art, the public still expects to
encounter them in a natural history museum, not among the
sculptures and paintings ascribed to the fine arts.
</P>
<P>
   Race, class and sex identify issues at the heart of the exhibit.
How they're expressed ranges from the excruciatingly banal
photographs of Richard Billingham's lower-class family to the
grotesque sexual deformities sculpted by Jake and Dinos Chapman.
(Compared to Henry Darger's &UR;  &LR; disturbing, funny and weirdly
redemptive narrative paintings of the Vivian Girls, though, the
Chapmans are neither original in their vision of weird,
hermaphroditic sexuality, nor subtle.)
</P>
<P>
   How sophomoric the exploration of the themes can be is clear in
an assemblage by Sarah Lucas. ``Au Naturel`` consists of a bucket
and two melons, oranges and an upright cucumber on a mattress, in
obvious representation of sex partners.
</P>
<P>
   Obsession with body parts and their function, or the lack
thereof, is another prominent subject. The installation by Mona
Hatoum, ``Deep Throat,`` consists of a table setting in which the
dinner plate serves as monitor for a video of her throat, in the
process of swallowing .
</P>
<P>
   At its maximum limit is Marc Quinn's bust, made with his own
blood. The sculptor drew 5 quarts _ the approximate total amount of
blood in an average adult _ over several months, froze it and
carved his likeness from it. Now contained in its own special
refrigerated unit, it's like a religious reliquary, shocking in its
egotism but nothing more.
</P>
<P>
   But the loud and sour controversy allows no impartiality, and
has forced us to play devil's advocate, defending works of art that
might otherwise be dismissed as derivative and merely narcissistic.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, it also obscures some thoughtful, good work.
Rachel Whiteread's magical, ghostly casts of negative spaces will
alter the way you see a room and small spaces, like those under
chairs, forever more. Ron Mueck's perfectly scaled simulacrum,
``Dead Dad,'' is as attractive formally as it might be repellent in
subject matter. Painter Jenny Saville hybridizes the fierce
brushwork of Francis Bacon and Lucien Freud's unforgiving eye to
render suffocating, fleshy female nudes with compelling
painterliness.
</P>
<P>
   The critical issue of freedom of expression surrounding the
controversial exhibit will be debated in our courts, one hopes on
the principled high ground of constitutional law, not politics.
</P>
<P>
   And the court will eventually determine whether the museum has
the right to exhibit these works at government expense, or if the
mayor, representing civil government, has the power to enforce
his/its definition of what art is appropriate for display. &QL;

<P>
   HELENA, Ark. &UR;  &LR; _ This former plantation town in eastern Arkansas
is not an obvious choice for a festival, with a crumbling downtown,
a shrinking population now at 7,000 and all the economic problems
and racial tensions one would expect in Phillips County, the
poorest county in the state. But back in the 1930s and '40s, when
Helena was a relatively thriving agricultural port on the
Mississippi, it was the blues center of the Delta, with juke joints
lining the streets, now-legendary musicians playing for change on
the piers, and, beginning in 1941, a groundbreaking, highly
influential afternoon blues broadcast called ``King Biscuit Time,''
featuring the harmonica player Sonny Boy Williamson (the former
Rice Miller).
</P>
<P>
   Capitalizing on this heritage, local officials and blues fans
borrowed a trailer from a traveling evangelist 13 years ago and
used it as a stage for the first King Biscuit Blues Festival, which
has now grown to become the largest free blues gathering in the
South and an extraordinary opportunity for fans of the music to see
a living tradition reconnect with its roots.
</P>
<P>
   The 14th annual festival took place last week, from Thursday to
Saturday, and thus overcame what may have been the greatest odds
ever stacked against it. First came a lawsuit filed by a handful of
local disgruntled black merchants and the regional branch of the
NAACP charging civil rights violations. Naming the city's mayor,
Dr. Robert D. Miller (the first-ever black mayor in this town with
a minority white population), and the City Council as defendants,
the lawsuit alleged that the city favored white merchants and
festival organizers.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, several sponsors (whose support is crucial to
pulling off a free concert that doesn't receive any government
money) threatened to withdraw if the festival didn't change its
logo. That was a replica of the design on packages of Sonny Boy
Cornmeal (an illustration of Sonny Boy Williamson sitting on an ear
of corn with a harmonica in his hands), which were sold in the '40s
by the makers of King Biscuit Flour to exploit the popularity of
the radio show. Although Williamson was said to have been proud of
the package, festival sponsors thought the image could be construed
as racist. And then there was one more threat to the festival, the
weather report: rain, rain and more rain.
</P>
<P>
   But three weeks ago, a federal judge ruled in favor of the
festival. And promoters solved the logo dispute by cropping the
cornmeal image so that it showed just a close-up of Williamson's
face and harmonica.
</P>
<P>
   But they could not stop the rain. It either poured or drizzled
through most of the festival, forcing the cancellation of several
acts, including Little Milton. As loyal locals and blues hounds
from around the world stood in the downpour while Magic Slim and
the Teardrops performed, the electric shocks Magic Slim kept
getting from the microphone didn't help the performance any.
Because of the terrible weather, the festival, which expected
attendance to top last year's 135,000, saw fewer than 100,000
people over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, for those who showed up, the King Biscuit Blues
Festival was a casual and ideal way to experience the music. Fans
sat on railroad tracks or in folding chairs on the grassy levee,
watching performances by Robert Lockwood Jr., Son Seals, Pinetop
Perkins with Bob Margolin, Sam Carr, W.C. Clark, the duo of Cephas
and Wiggins and dozens more. Cherry Street, running behind the
stage, seemed to be in a time warp, with musicians who weren't
booked in the festival playing for change in the street, their
electric guitars plugged into the outlets of obliging stores like
the V.I.P. Beauty Salon. At stalls in the road, the James Alexander
Masonic Lodge sold hog maws, Live Critters offered hermit crabs and
the Lighthouse Assembly of God displayed dolls made out of hymn
books.
</P>
<P>
   Onstage on Saturday night was Son Seals, who has become a road
warrior in recent years despite having had his leg amputated over
the summer because of diabetes complications and the lower half of
his face reconstructed after being shot by his wife two years ago.
For more than an hour he played fast, melting lead guitar lines
that oozed off the stage like syrup. Backstage, sitting with the
pianist Pinetop Perkins, he discussed the letter he had written to
the local newspaper to help defend the festival from accusations of
racism, accusations that festival promoters and most townspeople
say are trumped up. ``I had to do that,'' Seals said. ``I wanted to
tell the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Perkins, 86, sat slouched in a chair next to him, nodding in
agreement and telling stories about performing in Helena more than
50 years ago. ``I've been playing here since way back, as the King
Biscuit Boys,'' he said, clicking his tongue. ``Ain't but two of us
left.''
</P>
<P>
   The other remaining King Biscuit Time mainstay, Robert Lockwood
Jr., lived around Helena as a teen-ager, playing guitar with his
stepfather, Robert Johnson. Of all the Delta musicians onstage,
Lockwood had deviated most from his roots, playing his own
blues-jazz hybrid on 12-string guitar over the swing and jump of a
brassy backing band.
</P>
<P>
   As if performances by Lockwood and Perkins weren't enough of a
connection to Helena's musical past, a further reminder came from
the fact that not only was there a street named after the bluesman
Frank Frost two blocks away from the main stage, but Frost was
still living on that street. Barely able to play because of ill
health, Frost made a brief appearance during a set by his bandmate
of 45 years, the drummer Sam Carr. Spectators onstage said they saw
Carr crying as he played.
</P>
<P>
   Blues in the Delta has always been an around-the-clock
occupation. After performing on the main stage for tens of
thousands of people, many musicians went straight to nearby
hangouts like Ellie Mae's to perform in dilapidated barrooms for
just a handful of locals and fans.
</P>
<P>
   The best of these impromptu performances was a small picnic at
Carr's shack, which stands in the middle of a picturesque stretch
of farmland across the Mississippi River. Identifying the house and
its occupant is a mailbox that, Carr said, has occasionally been
stolen by blues souvenir hunters. For an audience of about 25
people, Carr beat highly stylized stiff-armed patterns.
Accompanying him from the other side of a picnic table was the
harpist Arthur Williams, who sat under a tree wailing merrily away
with a briefcase full of harmonicas splayed open at his feet.
</P>
<P>
   For those whose tastes ran beyond the blues, the festival had
more to offer. Inside the Malco Theater on Cherry Street local
gospel groups sang and preached for enthusiastic townspeople. Among
them was Mayor Miller, who stood in the lobby buying popcorn. ``I
know it looks a little odd for the mayor of a town with the largest
blues festival in the South to be at the gospel stage,'' he said
sheepishly. ``Especially since I'm a Roman Catholic. But my son is
a Pentecostal minister, and he's my spiritual adviser.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller said he was thinking of starting a gospel festival,
although he remained a blues fan and played piano with the King
Biscuit Boys in 1945 to fill in for an ailing musician. He stuffed
a handful of popcorn in his mouth and reached to pickeather
medical bag on the counter, explaining that he was also the local
general practitioner and had just attended to an emergency.
</P>
<P>
   As for the lawsuit, he dismissed it. ``As long as I'm mayor, the
festival is not going anywhere,'' he said, adding after a
reflective pause, ``and that's probably why I am mayor here.''
</P>

TAPPING INTO THE FLOW OF WEB DOLLARS TO AID SCHOOLS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., N.C.)   (bl)  
 By FRANCES DINKELSPIEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   E-commerce is coming to the aid of the PTA, and Debbie Schide is
delighted.
</P>
<P>
   On most school mornings, Ms. Schide and a dedicated group of
volunteers find themselves in the schoolyards and parking lots of
the Menlo-Atherton school district in northern California. They are
selling scrip, a type of gift certificate that has become a
fund-raising mainstay for thousands of schools across the country.
Stores sell the certificates at a discount to schools, which then
sell them at face value to supporters. When the scrip is spent, the
school gets a small rebate, something like a legal kickback.
</P>
<P>
   As a fund-raising tool, scrip is lucrative _ Ms. Schide's school
district alone netted $65,000 from it last year. But it is
labor-intensive. ``It's a major operation, but it's so beneficial
to the school we have to do it,'' Ms. Schide said.
</P>
<P>
   But her workload, and that of thousands of other parent
volunteers, is about to change. In the last year, a number of
online versions of scrip sales have emerged. At Schoolpop
(www.schoolpop.com) and Your School Shop (www.yourschoolshop.com),
parents use the companies' home pages as portals to national
retailers like Amazon.com, J.C. Penney and Officemax. Each online
purchase kicks back a small percentage to the school, and the
merchants also pay a small percentage of each purchase to the scrip
service.
</P>
<P>
   Escrip (www.escripinc.com) also aims to eliminate the hassle of
scrip sales by turning them into electronic transactions. With
Escrip, participants register their credit and debit cards, and a
percentage is sent to a designated charity each time the cards are
used at participating businesses. The merchants that have signed up
with Escrip include Budget Rent-a-Car, American Airlines, Payless
Shoe Source and Eddie Bauer. Escrip transfers the rebates
electronically to schools, or to charities, and sends each family a
detailed list of its monthly purchases, including what percentage
of the sales benefited the charity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see schools making a tremendous amount more money on this
program than they could previously on paper,'' said Joanne
Remillard, executive vice president of community groups at
Electronic Scrip Inc., or ESI, in San Mateo, Calif., which operates
the program. ``It is much more convenient.''
</P>
<P>
   Scrip originated about 10 years ago in Petaluma, Calif., when
families there were casting about for a way to rescue a struggling
Catholic school. The school's supporters and the local diocese
approached the local Safeway grocery store and struck a deal to
purchase gift certificates at a 5 percent discount.
</P>
<P>
   Families bought the certificates at face value and raised enough
money to put the school on a sound financial footing.
</P>
<P>
   That program grew into the National Scrip Center, a nonprofit
organization in Santa Rosa, Calif., that sells about $450 million
worth of scrip annually to about 11,000 schools and nonprofit
groups across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Organizations can buy gift certificates from major stores like
Macy's, Gap, Barnes &AMP; Noble and United Artists Theaters at
discounts ranging from 2 percent to 20 percent. Numerous grocery
stores also sell scrip directly to schools.
</P>
<P>
   Paper scrip programs have garnered hundreds of thousands of
dollars for schools, helping them buy computers, hire art and music
teachers and pay for school trips and renovations. But the programs
are not easy to manage. Schools often must float thousands of
dollars up front to pay for the scrip, a requirement that can be
difficult for poorer schools. Paper scrip is essentially cash, so
schools must work out a security system to store it and delivery it
safely. Accounting can be cumbersome.
</P>
<P>
   All those problems can be eliminated with electronic versions of
scrip. ``There's a tremendous amount of paper work and the
collecting of cash to purchase scrip,'' said Ian Diary, a former
Apple executive who is the chief executive of ESI. ``All that
disappears with Escrip.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Scrip Center, which controls the bulk of the
nation's scrip business, plans to go on line later this year, said
its chief executive, Edward Phillips. The organization is also
planning to introduce a credit card that can be used in lieu of
paper scrip.
</P>
<P>
   The new electronic programs can extend the purchasing power of a
school beyond its traditional borders. Anyone can sign on to the
Internet, designate a school and make a purchase.
</P>
<P>
   ``This allows Grandma in Boise and the alumni in Boston to
support the school in Los Angeles,'' said Rea Callender, a former
schoolteacher who is now chief executive of Schoolpop.com, based in
Menlo Park, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Schools seem eager to reduce their administrative overhead for
scrip programs. While Escrip and Schoolpop have been open for only
a few months, they are registering schools in droves. More than
7,500 schools have signed up on Schoolpop; 300 have registered with
Your School Shop, which opened in August. Escrip recently made an
exclusive deal with Safeway, one of the nation's largest grocery
chains, and it is now receiving 90 calls a day from schools, Diary
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're always looking for ways to raise funds,'' said Tim Amos,
an assistant superintendent whose district, Asheville City Schools
in North Carolina, has signed up with Schoolpop. ``This seemed like
a safe way to do it. You don't have children knocking on doors,
selling candy or magazines or things like that. I think it's a
growing thing because more and more people are buying things on the
Internet. ``
</P>
<P>
   Escrip promises to simplify accounting for merchants as well.
Participating companies can go on line to look at their accounts
and see the amount of scrip sales at their stores. Many, like
Safeway, are eliminating their paper scrip program in favor of
Escrip.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought it would be a great way to increase awareness of
the company, build customer loyalty and put money back into
community schools and other nonprofits,'' said Sue Welty, a
spokeswoman for Budget Rent-a-Car, which will give an 8 percent
rebate on the price of a car rental.
</P>
<P>
   The new programs have their drawbacks. Escrip charges each
family $10 annually to register all its credit cards, and some
scrip administrators report that some people are unwilling or
unable to pay those fees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our older members, many of whom are on fixed incomes, are
reluctant to plunk out $10,'' said Odette Blachman, who sells scrip
for Temple Beth-El in Berkeley, Calif. For schools in low-income
areas, ESI is considering subsidies for families who cannot afford
the annual fee, Diary said.
</P>
<P>
   Schoolpop, aware that some families do not have access to the
Internet, is recruiting businesses and asking them to adopt
schools, Callender said. The businesses could make their purchases
on line and have the rebates sent to local schools that have large
numbers of students without computers at home.

FOR ANCIENT NATIONS, VIRTUAL TRADE ROUTES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: S.C., N.Y., La.)  (th) 
 By JONATHAN LESSER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   On a recent trip to visit the Catawba Indian Nation in Catawba,
S.C., Dan Umstead, a member of the Oneida Nation of central New
York, was shown centuries-old pottery of Oneida design excavated
there, some 800 miles from home.
</P>
<P>
   For members of the six-nation Iroquois Confederacy, which
includes the Oneida, it was once common to travel half a continent
on foot to trade with other Indian nations. That trade became much
more difficult in the 19th century, when many tribes were moved to
reservations.
</P>
<P>
   As some Indian nations, thanks in large part to gambling, have
flourished economically again in the 1990s, nation-to-nation trade
has become a hot topic among tribal leaders. The modern version of
nation-to-nation trade involves goods ranging from T-shirts to
computers, and the trade routes are virtual rather than physical.
The marketplace is the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Umstead, for example, is the Oneida's manager of Internet
services. At a meeting in June of leaders of the United South and
Eastern Tribes, or USET, a nonprofit intertribal organization,
Umstead unveiled the Nation to Nation Trade Forum, an online
bulletin board (bbs.oneida-nation.net) aimed at connecting the
organization's 23 member tribes to discuss trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``The USET committees thought that the idea of reaffirming these
traditional trade ties between nations was good,'' Umstead said.
``But let's take it a step further, into the 21st century.'' The
Web site even has a fill-in-the-blank model of a bilateral trade
agreement; it is available for downloading, although that service
has had no takers so far.
</P>
<P>
   Keller George, president of United South and Eastern Tribes,
estimates that 60 percent to 70 percent of the organization's
member tribes are online. Those who are not, like the small Gena
band of Choctaw Indians in Alexandria, La., who are currently
starting a deck-chair business, can market their products to
different Indian nations through the tribal organization's Web
site.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just trying to get back to the basics of how the Indian
people a long time ago did nation-to-nation trade, by finding out
what products they had to offer,'' George said. ``Then it was done
on a more personal basis, but today I think we can do it with
technology.''
</P>
<P>
   One tribe that is not online yet but plans to be by the end of
the year is the Unkechaug tribe of Long Island, which sells its
organic coffee to the Oneida of both New York and Wisconsin and to
the Winnebago tribe in Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   The coffee is already available online at Allnative.com, a Web
commerce site (www.allnative.com) owned by the Winnebago that also
sells Indian-made crafts, computers and clothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is significant production and development going on in
Indian country,'' said the Unkechaug chief, Harry Wallace. ``There
is also a significant marketing ability.''
</P>
<P>
   A hurdle facing both Wallace and George is the potential for
online fraud. How can the Indian traders be sure that they are
dealing with people who are in fact American Indians? The use of
passwords has been discussed, but George says he is not worried
about the future of his new venture over all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our people have been survivors because we've been able to
adapt to whatever was there for us,'' he said. ``We've gone from
using natural resources to using technology. If we don't take
advantage of the technology that is there for us today, then shame
on us.''

TRYING ON CLOTHES IN A VIRTUAL DRESSING ROOM

   COSMOPOLITAN FASHION MAKEOVER DELUXE
</P>
<P>
   (Broderbund; $49.95; Windows 95, 98 and NT.)
</P>
<P>
   Buying clothes on line has proved to be a lifesaver for women
who are not quite up to dealing with the rambunctious hassle of
stores, crowds and dressing rooms. Going for convenience rather
than a perfect fit (``it looked great on screen'') has been a major
drawback, though. But now there is hope for women still loath to
f'ht the traffic outside and inside the mall.
</P>
<P>
   In conjunction with Cosmopolitan magazine, Broderbund has
recently released its Cosmopolitan Fashion Makeover program. The
software lets women try on clothes on line before ordering them
from the Macy's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   The program uses 3-D rendering technology called My Virtual
Model to create the on-screen figures. Users can pick one of
several cheery voices to guide them as they set things up. ``Think
of your Virtual Model as your electronic second self,'' the voice
urges.
</P>
<P>
   After the shopper types in her measurements (which can be done
to the beat of Muzak-meets-the-Paris-runway music, but it can be
turned off, thank goodness), the program will create and display a
computerized version of the shopper's body in modest undergarments.
A measuring tape is even included with the software, and the model
can be protected with a password for the bashful _ or those with
brothers who might be overly intrigued by the model's Undress
button.
</P>
<P>
   The model can be rotated 360 degrees for viewing at all angles.
For the final dab of personalization, the user can even add a
digital photo of her face to the pixelated paper doll.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to look as much like you as I can,'' the chirpy
narrator says at one point in the model-creation process. The head
proportion seemed a bit off on some of the figures after a custom
picture was imported onto a body, however, which might be vaguely
unsettling to some.
</P>
<P>
   Once a woman has a electronic second self, the fashion games
really begin. The program whisks the virtual body to the home page,
which offers several options. The shopper can go into the Flatter
Your Figure area for sartorial tips on what kinds of clothes look
best on her body type. Those users who already have this
information will probably head directly to the Dressing Room.
</P>
<P>
   The Dressing Room is where the goods are. Menus for different
categories of clothes appear on the screen, and the program will
display a selection of items available. Once a woman has settled on
a particular garment, she can drag and drop it onto her digital
body to see how it looks. (If only getting dressed in the morning
was this easy.) If she likes what she sees, she can take a snapshot
of it, save the file on her hard drive and send it as an e-mail
attachment to family and friends.
</P>
<P>
   Shoppers can mix and match dozens of different items, including
shoes and handbags. The site offers clothing appropriate for every
situation, from business meetings to casual weekends. For those
concerned that the program's fashions will go out of style,
seasonal updates about new merchandise can be downloaded from a
Cosmopolitan Web site (www.fashionmakeover.com).
</P>
<P>
   The shopper can click on each item of clothing for a details box
that gives the size, designer, price and availability. Liz
Claiborne, Esprit, Carole Little and I.N.C. are among the designers
represented.
</P>
<P>
   Since some manufacturers have their own size standards, the
program will convert the shopper's particular measurements into the
appropriate size for each item selected. The Add to Shopping Bag
button is also there, and when the shopping is done, Fashion
Makeover will open the user's Web browser and whisk her to
www.macys.com &UR;  &LR; for nearly instant consumer gratification.
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to find the Cosmopolitan content in the program. One
area offers fashion advice from the magazine's staff, and fashion
tips pop up in little boxes on the screen as the shopper browses.
The user-interface colors consist of soft pastels like pink and
purple that dominate women's magazine layouts. (In fact, the
shopper can print a Cosmo cover with her digital self, front and
center.)
</P>
<P>
   Personal empowerment messages abound. ``I'm meant to be your
reflection,'' reads some of the text on the screen that appears
right after the virtual model has been set up. ``And I'm here to
help you look and feel your very best.''
</P>
<P>
   To make Cosmopolitan Fashion Makeover feel its very best, the
shopper needs what is readily available on most current systems: a
minimum of 32 megabytes of RAM (it works better with 64 megabytes),
1 megabyte of VRAM, a SVGA video card that supports 16-bit color
and a CD-ROM drive. The program takes up 150 megabytes of hard
drive space. Cosmopolitan Fashion Makeover also comes in a standard
version that has fewer features than the deluxe edition and costs
$10 less.
</P>
<P>
   Cosmopolitan Fashion Makeover is aimed at women 18 and older, a
demographic group that until now has not been courted by software
makers as assiduously as men have been. Although the program can be
frighteningly perky at times, it is nice to see software that uses
powerful 3-D technology more productively than shoot-'em-up action
games.
</P>
<P>
   And frankly, the virtual women here are much better dressed.
</P>

PRIVATE EYES IN THE SKY GO TO COURT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ind., Calif., N.C., Va.)   (af)  
 By PETER WAYNER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Several years ago, David A. Landgrebe, a professor at Purdue
University's School of Electrical and Computer Engineering who
studies satellite imagery, found himself describing his research in
deep technical detail to a local judge when they met socially.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went through the whole spiel and wondered what he would ever
do with the information,'' Landgrebe recalled. ``When I asked the
judge, he said: `There's more lying going on in the courtroom, and
I need to make a decision. One lawyer describes some land as
worthless. Another claims it's worth a fortune. I want something to
trust.''
</P>
<P>
   Satellite imagery is beginning to make the jump from being a
secret tool of spies to being a tool of the justice system. New
satellites offering images with significantly better resolution to
the general public will make it possible for experts to reconstruct
the scene of a crime or an accident so the courts can analyze the
event.
</P>
<P>
   A company called Space Imaging released a photograph on
Wednesday from a commercial spy satellite showing objects as small
as three feet wide.
</P>
<P>
   As more precise images become available, satellite photography
is likely to become more useful in the next few years, even as it
opens up a new area for disputes between expert witnesses in court.
</P>
<P>
   A small California company named Visual Forensics demonstrated
the potential of this technology when its team of scientists and
computer graphics experts used satellite data to construct a
computer model of the valley in Italy where a United States
warplane sliced through the cable of an aerial tram in 1998,
killing 20.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors argued that the pilots were showing off, trying to
fly under the cable. A film produced by Visual Forensics tried to
counter this assertion by demonstrating how the shape of the valley
could create an optical illusion that could confuse a pilot.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Johnson, the director of motion graphics at Visual
Forensics, said: ``The optical illusion first became apparent to my
partner when he took a helicopter route along the flight path. The
first thing that struck him was that the river that ran down the
center of the valley appeared to be running uphill. It's the
classic optical illusion that gives you the illusion of gaining
altitude when you're really losing altitude.''
</P>
<P>
   The team at Visual Forensics used the satellite images of the
valley to create a three-dimensional model of the terrain in a
computer. Then they created an animated film showing how even a
conscientious pilot could make mistakes about the altitude.
</P>
<P>
   A military jury in Camp Lejeune, N.C., which saw the film,
ultimately agreed that the pilot, Capt. Richard Ashby, was not
guilty of involuntary homicide and manslaughter and acquitted him
in March; he was later convicted of obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   Satellite images can be ideal for recreating the scene of a
crime or an accident. All optical lenses add distortion, but the
amount depends upon the design of the lens and its distance from
the object. Close photographs often show significant bending and
warping in the corners. Satellite photos, on the other hand, are
taken from miles away and are able to map a scene with precision.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, satellite photos have not usually had enough
precision to be useful. The images are ideal for large events like
airplane crashes, but they have generally not had enough detail to
help investigate events like car crashes, which occur on a smaller
scale.
</P>
<P>
   That promises to change in the next several years as several
companies and nations race to launch satellites that can offer
1-meter resolution. In the past, most civilian services offered
10-meter resolution. (The resolution figure is a rough measurement
of the size of the object that can be seen on an image.)
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be fantastic,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Landgrebe said he was looking forward to the EO1, a new
satellite that will offer about 200 to 300 spectral bands of
information.
</P>
<P>
   Each band is really a number indicating the intensity of a
certain color emanating from a certain spot. Televisions, for
example, use three bands of information _ cyan, magenta and yellow
_ to display images.
</P>
<P>
   More bands give scientists better information to analyze the
plants and minerals being photographed by the airplane. Marijuana
plants, for instance, may reflect distinctive shades of green and
red that show up in 2 of the 300 different spectral bands. The
police might search for illicit crops by looking for locations that
show high amounts of those particular colors.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said his company was excited about this extra spectral
data because it could help in investigating disputes about
pollution and ground water. Information about the type of
vegetation and the temperature of the ground can help track the
flow of water in such cases.
</P>
<P>
   But the extra information could also muddy the water. Dr.
Stefanie Tompkins, a satellite imaging expert who works in northern
Virginia, pointed out that the extra information could be confusing
because one scientist could emphasize certain bands in creating an
image, while a scientific expert for a rival in a legal proceeding
could emphasize different bands. That could lead to strikingly
different images from the same data.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can make something look very significant, but in some
cases it could be an instrument artifact,'' Tompkins said. ``In
some cases, it's something real, but it's not as big a deal. You
can stretch or enhance a certain feature.''
</P>
<P>
   While many members of the general public are eager to have
high-resolution information, military and intelligence officials
worry that easy access will promote spying. They have lobbied to
restrict these satellites in the hope of keeping their advantages.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson understands their hesitations but argues that the new
information is too valuable to bottle up. ``I think the compromises
are  in the works,'' he said. ``The advantages of using
satellite information will be too great for the intelligence
community to keep a lid on the technology.''

INCOGNITO SPINMEISTERS BATTLE ONLINE CRITICS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By REBECCA FAIRLEY RANEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The scene unfolds on the Internet every day: a pack of outraged
consumers takes over the discussion in an online forum with heated
criticism of some offending product, perhaps a brand of stereo
speakers.
</P>
<P>
   Then someone asks, `If these speakers are so awful, how could
the company have moved from No. 10 to No. 2 in the last year?'
After that, the criticism in the forum fades.
</P>
<P>
   It would be fair to suspect, in a case like this, that the
participant who raised the question that turned the criticism
around worked for the company that made the speakers. In fact, a
small industry is emerging among consultants who specialize in
spinning online discussions to favor the positions of companies and
interest groups.
</P>
<P>
   Shabbir J. Safdar and his business partner, Jonah Seiger,
regularly adopt pseudonyms and participate in online discussions on
behalf of some clients. Their firm, Mindshare Internet Campaigns,
in Washington, specializes in running the Internet side of advocacy
campaigns. It offers the spin doctor service as part of the
package.
</P>
<P>
   Some firms, in keeping with a traditional practice in public
relations, recruit scientists and other experts to voice clients'
perspectives in online discussions. Matthew Benson, a senior
director at the Washington public relations firm Bivings Woodell,
and Ken Deutsch, vice president of Internet strategic
communications at Issue Dynamics, a public affairs firm in
Washington, have specialized for years in steering experts to
online forums on behalf of clients.
</P>
<P>
   Without question, these practices have made people taking part
in online discussions suspicious. Questions about participants'
identities and affiliations are becoming more common.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, for example, online discussions about the
registration of Internet domain names have been packed with
revelations that some participants have received backing from
companies affected by the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Fenello, who, until recently, was president of Iperdome, a
domain name registration company in Atlanta, has weighed in
regularly in 10 online discussion groups against the policies of
the government-backed group that is deciding the future of the
registrations. Until he closed the company in September to become a
full-time consultant, he usually signed his messages by identifying
himself as president of Iperdome.
</P>
<P>
   But his opponents recently posted messages saying that Fenello
has also been working as a consultant for Network Solutions, the
company whose monopoly on domain name registrations is being
dismantled. In response, he acknowledged the tie but played down
its importance, saying his opponents were using it just to
discredit him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something that I freely admitted,'' Fenello said. ``It's
just like presidential politics. When something can be used as a
weapon, it is.
</P>
<P>
   ``I challenge anybody to detect any changes in my statements
when I was working with Network Solutions and when I was not.
Everybody in this debate is somehow funded by somebody.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether companies' efforts to sway opinions on the Internet,
surreptitiously or openly, ultimately improve the quality of online
discourse or damages its credibility is debatable. Some argue that
the practice of spinning discussions is less chilling than it is
for companies to sue their online critics _ just as lawsuits once
became a tame alternative to dueling.
</P>
<P>
   Not that companies have stopped turning to the courts.
</P>
<P>
   David Sobel, general counsel for the Electronic Privacy
Information Center, a nonprofit research group, said the center had
identified 20 cases in recent months in which companies had filed
defamation suits against online critics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wouldn't surprise people who frequent these discussion
groups to know that there are people being paid to say good things
about a company,'' Sobel said. ``That tradition comes with the
territory of the Internet. What traditionally hasn't come with the
territory is getting hauled into court.'' When compared to
litigation, Sobel said, even using deception to try to turn around
criticism online is ``a better approach.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The antidote to speech,'' he added, ``is more speech.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Because participants in Internet forums are becoming more
suspicious, they are quick to challenge anyone who seems to be
hiding an affiliation.
</P>
<P>
   In August, for example, people participating in a discussion of
broadband Internet access started questioning Audrie Krause about
her ties to AT&AMP;T, a major company concerned with the issue. Ms.
Krause, a consultant in San Francisco, had presented herself in
such discussions as a consumer advocate and argued against
government regulation.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview, Ms. Krause said she did ``Internet
outreach'' for a political consulting firm whose client is AT&AMP;T,
but that the work ``really isn't relevant to the position I'm
taking.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The work that I'm doing that's funded by specific interests is
very aboveboard,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Her opponents argue otherwise. Jamie Love, director of the
Consumer Project on Technology, a nonprofit group, said forum
participants were uncomfortable with Ms. Krause's ties.
</P>
<P>
   ``She always stands up and says, `As a consumer advocate, this
is the position I take,' '' Love said. ``You should say, `As a
lobbyist for AT&AMP;T, this is where I come out on it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Tora Bikson, a senior scientist at Rand Corp. who has studied
online discourse, compared the practice of influencing online
discussions with ``pump priming'' in public meetings, in which
politicians plant supporters in the audience to ask friendly
questions.
</P>
<P>
   The practice on the Internet is ``more distressing,'' she
contended, because people in the audience may expect questions to
be planted in public meetings but may not be aware that
perspectives are being planted in online settings.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't know there are ringers and spin doctors,'' Dr.
Bikson said, ``that immediately damages the credibility of the
forum. People could end up damaging the medium because everybody
does want it to be this open medium.''
</P>
<P>
   On its face, the fear of the power of online critics may appear
to be unjustified. Online discussion lists and forums tend to reach
only several hundred people at most.
</P>
<P>
   But opinions formed in even the most obscure electronic byways
can reach the mainstream quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Consultants who monitor forums for companies consider online
discussions to be an early warning system for consumer complaints
and public perceptions. At best, the consultants can strangle
misinformation in the electronic cradle.
</P>
<P>
   ``If participated in properly,'' said Benson, at Bivings
Woodell, ``these can be vehicles for shaping emerging issues.''
</P>
<P>
   He and other consultants approach online forums cautiously.
</P>
<P>
   When deciding whether to intervene in a discussion, Benson said,
they weigh a number of factors: How serious a forum is it? Do
influential people frequent the discussion? How much reach does the
forum have outside its own boundaries? Are the critics considered
influential by the group, or are they merely considered annoying?
</P>
<P>
   The hardest part of the job, many consultants say, is to
encourage companies to use restraint in their responses.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see a lot of companies overreacting,'' said Deutsch, at
Issue Dynamics. ``They don't realize that not everyone is
influential. They want to fight out every opponent on every
discussion list they see.''
</P>
<P>
   The easiest situation to handle is when critics of a company are
posting blatantly inaccurate information. In those cases,
consultants encourage representatives of the companies to respond
openly and set the record straight.
</P>
<P>
   That strategy worked well earlier this year for Steve Mihaylo,
chief executive of Inter-Tel, a digital communications company
based in Phoenix. On a Yahoo message board read by many of the
company's large shareholders, critics were ripping into the
company's employees and marketing practices. When the criticism of
individuals became too personal, Mihaylo stepped up to defend them.
</P>
<P>
   In his first posting, he wrote, ``There is so much
misinformation and just plain bad manners on this message board
that I thought this might be a refreshing way to bring some
objectivity to this process.''
</P>
<P>
   The tone on the message board changed immediately.
</P>
<P>
   All the participants started addressing the chief executive of
the company that they had just been trashing as ``Mr. Mihaylo.''
The virulence of their questions diminished.
</P>
<P>
   But consultants warn that in some cases, a company only fans the
hostility by issuing a statement openly.
</P>
<P>
   In cases like that, consultants may enter the discussion using
false identities or by misrepresenting their interests.
</P>
<P>
   But the tactic is risky _ so risky that some firms stick to
recruiting outside parties like scientists or other advocates for a
company's position to get involved without disclosing the company's
role.
</P>
<P>
   The potential for trouble is why Safdar, of Mindshare Internet
Campaigns, recommends a light touch for companies when they
intercede in online discussions.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you walk into a discussion that is ripe to go a certain
direction and you ask a question and the crowd is ripe to go that
direction, that's all you have to do,'' he said. ``You say, `If
they were evil, would they do this?'''
</P>
<P>
   But to gauge a group's dynamics requires long-term monitoring.
Bivings Woodell, for example, employs a division of four or five
people dedicated to monitoring.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to sit somebody in front of the computer,'' Safdar
said, ``and they have to develop a cultural memory for the issues
they're following.''
</P>
<P>
   Such labor-intensive work can command large fees. Safdar said he
had heard of companies running up bills of hundreds of thousands of
dollars for a year's monitoring and intervention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen some big price tags,'' he said. ``I've seen clients
who were very, very worried and would plunk down large sums of
money.''
</P>
<P>
   Consultants describe the subterfuge as a way to balance
discussions and defend the truth in a medium where facts can
prevail. Within that framework, they argue, the practice is
healthier for Internet discussion than a rash of lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of them want to sue,'' Deutsch said of clients who
approach his firm. ``It's a whole new ball game, and you can't
operate that way anymore. How a company treats organizations and
individuals on the Internet will affect how the public will
perceive the company.''

<P>
   ABOARD THE CONCORDE _ Ninety minutes out of Heathrow, I press my
nose against the porthole-sized window and gaze upon the distant
world below. The edges of the blue horizon are bowed slightly
downward; we're up so high I can actually make out the curvature of
the Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Above, the sky is dark indigo, almost black. Here in the upper
reaches of the stratosphere there are few dust particles to reflect
light. If we're not precisely ``on the edge of space,'' as British
Airways likes to put it, I can definitely see it from here.
</P>
<P>
   On the bulkhead in front of me, a control panel reads out the
essential information: Altitude: 58,500 feet above sea level.
Speed: 1,350 mph Mach 2 _ twice the speed of sound.
</P>
<P>
   Except for a handful of astronauts and military pilots, we
Concorde passengers are flying higher and faster than any other
humans. We are literally moving faster than a speeding bullet.
</P>
<P>
   More to the point, we're already halfway to New York.
</P>
<P>
   A flight attendant comes by, but it's hard to hear her above the
roar of the plane's four Rolls Royce engines. She gestures, and I
understand immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, thanks,'' I say, as she refills my fluted crystal glass
with Cattier Clos du Moulin champagne. By the time she's done
pouring, we've streaked another 10 miles across the sky.
</P>
<P>
   Three decades after it first punched through the sound barrier,
Concorde remains, in every meaningful sense, the pinnacle of
commercial air travel. In an age when flying increasingly resembles
travel by Greyhound bus _ at least for those in coach _ Concorde is
a throaty, head-turning, envy-inducing Lamborghini.
</P>
<P>
   It's at once a glimpse of the future and a throwback to the past
_ specifically to the heady 1960s, when aerospace engineers were
turned loose to dream big dreams and shatter the envelope, never
mind the cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a very real sense, Concorde was our Apollo program,'' said
Mike Bannister, the chief Concorde pilot for British Airways. ``It
had _ actually, still has _ the same level of technical achievement
and national pride.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the governments of Britain and France agreed to jointly
develop the supersonic jetliner in the fall of 1962, just as
President John F. Kennedy was officially setting America's sights
on the moon. Concorde made its maiden test flight in the spring of
1969 as Apollo 11 was fueling up for its rendezvous with the Sea of
Tranquility.
</P>
<P>
   There was even a race with the Russians, who were developing
their own supersonic jetliner, the TU 144 _ nicknamed the
``Concordski'' _ at the same time. (The Russians beat the British
and French through the sound barrier, but their plane crashed at
the 1973 Paris Air Show, and the program never recovered.)
</P>
<P>
   Just as it's becoming increasingly unlikely that we'll be
sending anyone back to the moon anytime soon, it's also looking as
if Concorde may be our one and only chance to fly faster than the
speed of sound. The fleet of 12 Concordes _ British Airways owns
seven, Air France five _ is, on average, 22.5 years old. When the
planes are taken out of service 10 to 15 years from now, neither
airline plans to replace them.
</P>
<P>
   One of the joys of flying Concorde is looking down and seeing a
jumbo jet on the same flight path 5 miles below. It appears to be
standing still as you go rocketing past. But on airline ledger
sheets, the opposite is true: The victory has gone, indisputably,
to the plodding jumbos.
</P>
<P>
   When Boeing developed the first jumbo, the 747, in the mid-'60s,
it was planned as a stopgap until the day, thought not to be far
off, when all passenger service went supersonic. (The jet was given
that distinctive hump so it could be converted into a cargo plane.)
</P>
<P>
   But noise and environmental concerns severely constrained
Concorde's market. Today it flies only London-New York, Paris-New
York, London-Barbados during the winter, and some charters.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually the accountants and bottom-line-watchers trumped the
engineers. By most estimates, it costs an airline five to eight
times as much to fly a passenger across the Atlantic aboard
Concorde as in a modern jumbo, such as a Boeing 777 or Airbus A340.
For now and the foreseeable future, the marketplace dictates that
slow and cheap, rather than fast and expensive, will rule the
skies.
</P>
<P>
   The implication is clear: If you've always dreamed of breaking
the sound barrier, you'd better start making your plans.
</P>

<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At Heathrow Airport's frenetic Terminal 4, I stride smugly past
the subsonic riffraff in their long, snaking lines and continue to
the far end of the concourse, where Concorde has an exclusive
check-in counter. There's one other person in line, and the woman
behind the desk treats me like a regular as she whisks away my
duffel bag and hands me my boarding card.
</P>
<P>
   British Airways' First Class/Concorde lounge is done up like an
exclusive London club, with dark wood and comfy leather chairs. At
the bar, passengers can help themselves to two kinds of champagne _
Laurent Perrier Grand Siecle or Charles Heidsick Brut _ and more
name-brand libations than I can count. There are croissants and
scones and bowls of clotted cream and platters of little cucumber
sandwiches with the crusts cut off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would you like to see Concorde?'' asks an attendant. He pulls
open the drapes with a voila! flourish, and there it is, right
outside the window, looking sleek and sexy, almost demanding to be
stroked.
</P>
<P>
   As chubby jumbo jets waddle past on the tarmac, I can't help but
notice how much the dart-shaped, delta-winged Concorde resembles
the Pan Am spaceship in ``2001: A Space Odyssey.'' I want to take
my time in the lounge, savoring the anticipation, but all too soon
my flight is being called.
</P>
<P>
   We board directly from the lounge. After years of flying in the
cavernous bellies of jumbo jets, I'm startled at how compact the
cabin seems. Concorde carries only 100 passengers, with two seats
on each side of the aisle. There's just one class of service _
first class, here called ``Supersonic Class.''
</P>
<P>
   (MORE ... MORE)
</P>
<P>
   As I proceed down the aisle, I'm on celebrity watch.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're pretty much guaranteed to see someone you know _ a
movie star or a rock star or a professional athlete,'' a British
Airways marketing executive had told me. ``Just the other day I sat
behind Eric Clapton.''
</P>
<P>
   It is with a certain effervescent giddiness that I approach my
seat. Will I be clinking champagne glasses with Claudia Schieffer?
Trading bon mots with Sting?
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, there are no celebrities on this flight, at
least none I recognize. There are a lot of passengers with tanned,
chiseled faces and an air of entitlement _ superstars of the
mergers-and-acquisitions world, perhaps, or Cabinet ministers of
small nations _ and a few people so wealthy they don't bother to
wear socks.
</P>
<P>
   My window seat is plush leather, but hardly spacious _ about
midway in size between a typical coach and business class seat,
albeit with lots of leg room. It cradles me like a sports-car seat.
The sides of the narrow fuselage curve in, and at 5-feet-8-inches,
I find that my head just about scrapes the top.
</P>
<P>
   There are all sorts of goodies stuffed into the seat back: Every
passenger gets a complimentary Wedgwood Concorde ashtray and a
leather portfolio filled with embossed Concorde stationery, an
elegant Concorde pen and a suitable- for-framing certificate
attesting that we have indeed broken the sound barrier.
</P>
<P>
   And then the best treat of all: A flight attendant comes by to
invite me to ride in the cockpit during takeoff. I make my way to
the front of the plane, sneaking glances at my fellow passengers _
still no celebrity sightings _ and turn sideways to creep through
the narrow passageway into the cockpit.
</P>
<P>
   As Flight Engineer Tony Brown crisscrosses me with harnesses in
the fold-down seat next to him, I notice that the cockpit's
controls are state-of-the-art _ circa 1969. There are virtually no
digital readouts; it is all analog gauges and dials and switches.
</P>
<P>
   ``These controls work just fine,'' Brown says. ``There's really
no point in messing with them.''
</P>
<P>
   As we taxi away from the gate, I can see envious faces pressed
up against the windows of the terminal. Concorde has been taking
off from Heathrow twice a day for the last 23 years, and it still
draws a crowd.
</P>
<P>
   During takeoff and landing, the plane's needle nose droops 12.5
percent so the crew can see the runway.
</P>
<P>
   It's our turn. Capt. Max Robinson counts down _ ``three ... two
... one'' _ then shoves the throttle all the way forward. Brown
throws the switch on the afterburners, and I am thrust firmly back
in my seat as we accelerate from 0 to 225 mph in 30 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   We don't ease off the ground like other jetliners; we rear up on
the back wheels and hurtle into the sky, gaining altitude at a
dizzying rate.
</P>
<P>
   Once we're airborne, the plane's nose rises up into position and
a clear visor covers the windshield, cutting noise dramatically.
Robinson throttles up to just below the speed of sound _ Mach .95 _
as we race across the green heart of England on the shortest path
to the sea. Flight rules prevent us from uncorking a sonic boom
until we're out over water.
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes we've cleared the north Devon coast, then the
Bristol Channel.
</P>
<P>
   It's time for the big moment.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, the flight engineer, flips on the afterburners again, and
the kick nudges me back into my seat. The speedometer needle
surges: Mach .97 ... .98 ... .99 ...
</P>
<P>
   As we surge ahead, I half expect to see stars turn into blurry
streaks, Star Wars-style.
</P>
<P>
   Brown leans over and says, ``Keep your eye on that gauge over
there.'' It's the vertical speed indicator, which flickers crazily
for a moment as a shock wave moves past the Concorde's outside
sensor plate.
</P>
<P>
   Other than the speedometer, which now reads Mach 1.0, this is
the only indication that we've burst through the sound barrier.
</P>
<P>
   There's no shuddering, no sonic boom that we can hear. It's
anticlimactic, really.
</P>
<P>
   As I make my way back to my seat, the metal around the bulkhead
is warm to the touch _ the result of friction from our
extraordinary speed. Because of this, the air frame of the plane
expands from 6 to 10 inches during each flight, contracting once it
cools off. Even so, the flight is smooth as can be: there's no
turbulence at this altitude.
</P>
<P>
   (MORE ... MORE)
</P>
<P>
   In my absence, my tray table has been lowered and covered with
linen and gleaming silverware, and a glass of Champagne waits for
me. The wines aboard Concorde are extraordinary _ the Champagne is
rotated among selections that include 1990 Dom Perignon and 1988
Tattinger, Comtes de Champagne _ but I notice that I seem to be the
only one imbibing. As we hit Mach 2, the blase Concorde regulars
around me wave off the bubbly and ask for Evian water.
</P>
<P>
   No movies are shown on the flight; there isn't time. There's
barely time, in fact, to serve a four-course meal.
</P>
<P>
   First comes a bowl of Brazilian papaya with strawberries,
raspberries and orange slices, then a little carrot-and-bran torte,
then a tiger prawn and mango salad with tamarind mint dressing,
accompanied by a rich 1994 Meursault Domaine Ropiteau-Mignon. The
food and wine are far and away the best I've ever had in the sky,
but I seem to be dining alone. Everyone else in my vicinity hasskipped the meal in favor of more Evian.
</P>
<P>
   Between bites I look out the window at the tops of massive
cumulonimbus clouds miles below us, at the inky indigo sky above,
and, when we're over clear ocean, at the curving horizon.
</P>
<P>
   For the cheese course (Double Gloucester and Italian Taleggio) I
try the claret, a velvety 1980 Chateau Petit Village.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the chocolate truffles come out, even I am waving
off the flight attendant.

<P>
   Over the years the plane has acquired quite a trove of its own
lore. On a Concorde flight in the early 1990s, Paul McCartney
played his guitar and led his fellow passengers in a sing-along of
Beatles songs.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago Brad Faxon, a member of the U.S. Ryder Cup team,
sank a putt that ran the length of the plane's cabin.
</P>
<P>
   Someone who did better at high school algebra than I figured out
that since the Concorde was moving at 1,330 mph, the ball traveled
8.5 miles, a world record.
</P>
<P>
   My favorite Concorde story involves rock artist Phil Collins.
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, the Live Aid all-star famine relief concert was being
held simultaneously at London's Wembley Stadium and Philadelphia's
Veterans Stadium. The other stars had to choose one or the other,
but Collins performed at the opening of the London concert, hopped
the Concorde to New York and arrived in Philadelphia in time to
play the end of the U.S. show.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall, on the evening flight from London to New York,
passengers are treated to a sight no earthbound humans have ever
witnessed: the sun rising in the west. Concorde takes off in
darkness but travels so fast it catches up with the sun.
</P>
<P>
   Along those same lines, I'm traveling backward in time in a
sense: My flight will land in New York an hour and 10 minutes
``before'' it took off from London. We blasted off from Heathrow at
10:30 a.m. local time, and are scheduled to touch down at JFK
around 9:20 a.m. local time. A neat trick.
</P>
<P>
   As the flight attendant clears away my plates and glasses, I
feel a slight over-the-top sensation and look up to see the our
speed slowing from our maximum of Mach 2. Our altitude is also
beginning to drop. We're only 21/2 hours into the flight, and
already we're beginning our descent.

MAKING A CONFESSION OF LOVE, BUT SOTTO VOCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By J.C. HERZ    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   If I were saying this on TV, I would request a wig and disguise
my voice. Because I have something to say, and it needs to be
heard. But it's deeply embarrassing, and potentially damaging to my
reputation. I've been struggling with this for a while now. And I
think at this point, it's best to be honest with myself and my
readers.
</P>
<P>
   The thing is ... (deep breath) ...
</P>
<P>
   The Backstreet Boys Puzzles in Motion CD-ROM _ I . It's
fantastic. It's (I can't believe I'm saying this) a really elegant
piece of interactive media. It's sophisticated, intellectually
challenging, even (God help me) classic.
</P>
<P>
   The concept is deceptively simple: take a video clip and divide
it into square pieces. Shuffle the pieces. The player shifts them
around to reassemble the video image.
</P>
<P>
   That is more challenging than it sounds, for a few reasons.
First of all, each piece is itself a moving image. It's impossible
to align adjoining contours because every area of the picture
changes from one moment to the next.
</P>
<P>
   So you can't work from an understanding of the still image
(trying to solve the puzzle as you would a static jigsaw will
actually impede your progress). You have to formulate some separate
understanding of how a moving image fractures.
</P>
<P>
   Also, on higher difficulty levels the pieces are not only
shuffled but also rotated or flipped. So you have to move them
around and figure out whether they're upside down or inverted
laterally or vertically. It's a four-dimensional jigsaw puzzle
whose colors and shapes are always shifting, which is pretty
innovative as these things go.
</P>
<P>
   Now, you might argue that the video image itself is arbitrary.
The Backstreet Boys were a good choice for commercial reasons, but
the designers could just as easily have used a piece of avant-garde
performance art and the puzzle would have worked equally well.
</P>
<P>
   You would be wrong. Oddly enough, there is something about
Backstreet Boys music videos that accentuates the puzzle-solving
experience.
</P>
<P>
   The disk contains five tracks from the band's first album (all
the bouncy pop confections you can't escape on the radio). The
music plays while you're working on these challenging visual
problems, which are purely cerebral.
</P>
<P>
   But _ this is the scary part _ if you turn the music off, it
takes you longer to solve the puzzles. I tried substituting other
kinds of music _ jazz, rock, techno, punk, big band standards, you
name it. The results were better than with no music, but not as
good as with the Backstreet Boys singles.
</P>
<P>
   There is something about those inane pop structures that
enhances visual problem-solving ability.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, music videos are ideally suited to kinetic puzzles
because there's so much movement in the frame. A landscape epic or
psychological drama wouldn't work nearly as well because it would
be easy to assemble pieces from long, static shots or big reaction
shots. ``Empire of the Sun'' would be a snap. MTV popcorn is a real
challenge.
</P>
<P>
   The Backstreet Boys are even more of a brain teaser because
they're a matching set. It's quite a task to determine which pouty
mouth goes with which bare chest and well-toned set of abdominal
muscles.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it's nothing a junior high school girl can't handle,
particularly if she already has pictures of the band members
plastered to her bedroom walls. There is a vast population that can
identify individual Backstreet Boys' chins and ears in a
split-second at a hundred paces. For people who have already
assembled a Backstreet Boys collage from the pages of Tiger Beat
magazine, the video puzzles are probably no big deal.
</P>
<P>
   Except here, the images have an ostensible purpose beyond swoony
teen-idol worship.
</P>
<P>
   If you're working on a brain puzzle, it's like, totally
necessary to focus on the Backstreet Boys playing beach volleyball,
or walking in silhouette against an ocean sunset, or running down a
hallway in white suits and candy-colored shirts, or on Nick _ the
floppy-haired blond kid _ bopping around in a mummy bondage
costume.
</P>
<P>
   Not that I would voluntarily do that if I weren't evaluating a
computer game, as part of my job. It's not as though I have a stash
of Backstreet Boys fanzines in my desk drawer or spend my spare
time trolling for teeny-bopper trivia on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   But if you're going to manipulate pictures of human beings on a
computer screen, they might as well be pictures of instant pop
stars whose careers and identities have been manufactured by global
media corporations.
</P>
<P>
   Bands fall in and out of favor, but the puzzle stays fresh
because it can replace them. (An 'N Sync version is already in the
pipeline.) If anyone was wondering what kind of computer games
young girls are likely to play, look no further. Follow the
hormones.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Sixty-five years ago, a brash young millionaire named
Nelson Aldrich Rockefeller bought the top floor of 810 Fifth Ave.,
at the corner of 62nd Street, then the southernmost apartment house
on upper Fifth Avenue. With its commanding views of Central Park,
it seemed like the perfect place for Rockefeller, then 26, and his
bride, Mary Todhunter Clark, to raise a large family.
</P>
<P>
   It was, and they did. They eventually expanded the property into
a 30-room triplex by buying the floor below and the penthouse
above. Last week, the heirs of Mary Clark Rockefeller _ she was
known as Tod, and died in April at 91 _ put a big chunk of that
apartment on the market.
</P>
<P>
   Priced at $19.5 million, it may be New York's most expensive
fixer-upper. And although the co-op building has a Fifth Avenue
address and prewar prestige, several agents say Mrs. Rockefeller's
apartment, which takes up the 13th floor and the penthouse, is
overpriced.
</P>
<P>
   While praising its full-floor apartments and discreet
side-street entrance, two agents murmured ``A-minus'' when
describing the building, which was constructed in 1926 to the
designs of J.E.R. Carpenter. Another cited a 1993 article in Town &AMP;
Country magazine that trumpeted the co-ops that were ``Tops on
Fifth''; 810 was not among them. It was placed in a second tier:
``Awfully Nice.''
</P>
<P>
   What Mrs. Rockefeller's 17-room, six-bath, four-fireplace home
does have, however, is sweeping views. And the glory of its last
owner's name. And a certain soap opera-style history.
</P>
<P>
   Like his mother, Abby Rockefeller, who fostered the Museum of
Modern Art and lived in rooms decorated by Donald Deskey of Radio
City Music Hall fame, Nelson Rockefeller was a lifelong fan of the
contemporary, in architecture and in art. In 1934, four years after
his marriage, he hired modern architect Wallace K. Harrison to
revamp the apartment at 810 and, later, to remodel the 12th-floor
spaces as well. ( Harrison would go on to design the Metropolitan
Opera House and to oversee the design of the United Nations
headquarters.) Rockefeller then hired Jean-Michel Frank, the hip
Paris or, to decorate via long distance portions of the 12th
floor.
</P>
<P>
   Harrison made a round dining room out of the original square
one, and for its floor, he sank 18th-century parquet de Versailles
into a gray marble border. He also had input into the remodeling of
the penthouse, but its Bauhaus-bare interiors are credited to Jan
Rutenberg.
</P>
<P>
   Frank filled Harrison's spectacular oval living room with
cutting-edge furniture and Rockefeller's edgy art: murals by
Matisse and Fernand Leger, gilded consoles by Diego Giacometti,
candy-colored carpets by Christian Berard, Louis XV-style
furniture, lean ivory tables. The sculptor Hans Arp carved a
squiggle-edge chunk out of a ceiling and back-lighted the resulting
hole for good measure.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Rockefeller had residences in Venezuela and at the
family compound at Pocantico Hills in Westchester County, this
modern aerie was the place he considered home, said architectural
historian Andrew Alpern. ``He liked it so much, in fact, that he
did not move out after his divorce,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Well, not entirely.
</P>
<P>
   When Tod and Nelson Rockefeller separated in 1961 _ she divorced
him in Reno, Nev., in 1962 _ they agreed to a Solomonic division of
property. She got the top two floors of the triplex; he got the
building's 12th floor, which included the oval living room. He then
reportedly ordered the connections between the his-and-her spaces
``permanently sealed.''
</P>
<P>
   A year later, Rockefeller, 55, and the governor of New York,
married Margaretta Fitler Murphy, known as Happy, a 36-year-old
divorced mother of four. The newlyweds proceeded to buy an
apartment in a building going up next door, at 812 Fifth, and
joined it to their portion of the neighboring triplex.
</P>
<P>
   Sensitive to what must have been an uncomfortably close living
arrangement, Rockefeller, who died in 1979, and Happy Rockefeller,
as well as their two sons, always used the elevator in 812.
</P>
<P>
   Tod Rockefeller's apartment is one of the highest priced co-ops
to come on the market in several years. It still has the round
dining room. It still has walnut boiseries in the living room: the
circa-1935 ribbon-edge panels are a prime example of Harrison's
``rococo motif,'' as described in Victoria Newhouse's monograph on
the architect.
</P>
<P>
   But make no mistake. It definitely needs lots of work.
</P>
<P>
   The wall of pear-wood veneer in the foyer still looks good,
although it could do with a coat of wax. Anyone buying the place
would be certain to knock down some walls _ starting with two
built-in bookcases in the front of the apartment. The walls cut off
a third of the original 17-by-26-foot living room to create a
gallery.
</P>
<P>
   Rockefeller evidently got custody of all the swank 1930s
furnishings, because his first wife _ a witty athlete who never
remarried _ decorated her big slice of the triplex in a mode that
can only be described as Greenwich-in-the-sky.
</P>
<P>
   The living room, as seen in the real-estate brochure, had the
aura of a country club foyer: baby-blue upholstered chairs, limply
pretty floral paintings, wan chintz. A cream carpet covered the
dining room's inset round of parquet de Versailles like a puddle of
evaporated milk.
</P>
<P>
   After the divorce, Tod Rockefeller used the corner library on
the lower floor as her bedroom, said Debby Solomon, the Douglas
Elliman agent who has listed the property. The space is Sensurround
celadon, from wall-to-wall carpet to paint.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Four bedrooms and three maids' rooms are on the main floor. The
kitchen is tiny, 12 by 11 feet, and unmodernized. A smaller kitchen
is in the two-bedroom penthouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people would probably want to rip out the walls and make
bigger bedrooms,'' Ms. Solomon said.
</P>
<P>
   Though the $19.5 million price tag struck a number of real
estate agents as high, they couldn't think of anything comparable.
A penthouse at 1060 Fifth Ave. had great views, a great terrace,
good condition and the original floor plan, and it sold this year
for $8 million. But it faced neither Fifth Avenue nor the park.
Another penthouse in an A-plus building on Park Avenue sold last
year for $11.5 million. But the terrace was only 200 square feet:
how dare they call it a penthouse? said one agent. Still, the
Rockefeller apartment needs at least hundreds of thousands of
dollars of work.
</P>
<P>
   The agents conceded that the views from the penthouse's
1,200-square-foot wraparound terrace are one-of-a-kind (when the
building at 800 Fifth Ave. went up in the late 1970s, it was set
back from the street; it didn't block the views of the
Rockefellers). But rooms are not as well laid out as those in the
buildings designed by Rosario Candela, the master of the prewar
apartment house.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Gray, the architectural historian, said 810's
architect, J.E.R. Carpenter, ``designed all the next-best
buildings.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether the building was ``next best'' or not, Tod and Nelson
Rockefeller and their five children were in good company during
their three decades at 810 Fifth Ave. William Randolph Hearst Jr.
lived there at one time, as did Richard M. Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   Tod Rockefeller's heirs and the real-estate agents arrived at
the price by looking at the prices of other penthouses on Fifth
Avenue, Ms. Solomon said. They also considered the protected
landmark views across the park and down Fifth Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Of the people who have seen it, Ms. Solomon said, price wasn't
the issue. ``They're trying to determine if they're at the right
emotional plane in their own lives to undertake a major project
like this,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``After all,'' she added in a whisper, ``it does need an awful
lot of work.'' &QL;

 HOME IMPROVEMENT QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
</HEADLINE>
  By BERNARD GLADSTONE 
 Includes illustration. 
 Copyright 1999 Bernard Gladstone 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: My house is only a couple of years old and there is a dead
bolt lock installed on the front door. This always closed easily
and lockly when the latch or key was turned, but for the
last few months this dead bolt has become very difficult to close _
in fact my young daughter can't seem to lock it.
</P>
<P>
   When the door is open the key turns easily and the bolt comes
out, but when the door is fully closed the end of the bolt doesn't
want to slide into its opening in the strike plate that is mounted
on the door frame.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently the end of the dead bolt no longer lines up wi
opening, but I don't know which way to move the strike plate, or
whether the opening has to be simply enlarged slightly. Can you
tell me how to do this without calling in a professional?
</P>
<P>
   A: First check all the hinge screws on the door to make sure
none have worked loose. If any are loose the hinges may have
allowed the door to sag and this could cause the dead bolt to be
slightly out of alignment with its strike plate.
</P>
<P>
   If this is not the problem you can check the alignment in this
manner: Open the door and turn the dead bolt latch or key. Then
mark the projecting end of the dead bolt by smearing a little wet
paint on it as shown here. Retract the dead bolt and close the
door.
</P>
<P>
   Now turn the dead bolt latch again until it hits the strike
plate. Retract the dead bolt once more, swing the door open, then
look at the strike plate. You will see where the paint mark is and
thus will know where the opening has to be enlarged.
</P>
<P>
   Take off the plate, lock it in a vise, and use a file to remove
the amount required to enlarge the opening.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The aluminum storm door on the front of my house is white and
I want to paint it a different color. What kind of paint should I
use and is there any special preparation required?
</P>
<P>
   A: Scrub the door with a strong detergent, then sand the white
finish with a medium grit sandpaper to remove all gloss. Dust
thoroughly and wipe down with a rag moistened with paint thinner.
Apply a first coat of enamel undercoat or a shellac-based primer,
then finish with two coats of exterior enamel, sanding lightly
between coats.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Our 50-year-old house has tongue-and-groove wood paneling in
the living room that is dirty and dull looking. How can we clean
this wood and preserve it?
</P>
<P>
   A: The most effective way to clean old paneling is to dust
thoroughly, then wipe down with a rag moistened with paint thinner
or other cleaning fluid (many of these solvents are flammable and
have an odor, so make sure there is plenty of ventilation and take
all proper precautions).
</P>
<P>
   Preserving the finish is a matter of determining what type of
finish was originally applied. If it was a wax type finish, then
simply applying a fresh coat of wax may be all that is required.
</P>
<P>
   However, if you are not sure, and if the varnish or shellac is
quite dull, then your best bet may be to apply one or two coats of
a wood sealer such as Minwax Tung Oil or Antique Oil Finish. I
would suggest you experiment on an inconspicuous corner first.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The concrete stoop on the front of our house has a corner
broken off on one of the steps. Although I tried filling in this
cavity with a good patching cement, this didn't last for long. Can
you tell me how to make a permanent repair to this concrete stoop?
</P>
<P>
   A: Instead of patching cement you should use a regular concrete
sand mix to build up the corner. However, this will require that
you build a wood form to hold the freshly mixed concrete in place
against the broken corner while it hardens.
</P>
<P>
   Clean off the old concrete thoroughly, making certain there is
no dirt or other foreign material on the surface, then build a
temporary form around the missing corner by using two boards that
are nailed together at right angles to each other, thus forming a
corner form.
</P>
<P>
   To hold this form in position, drive stakes into the ground on
each side, then nail these to the form boards. Or you may be able
to use several bricks or cement blocks propped against the outside
of the form.
</P>
<P>
   Coat the old masonry with a latex masonry bonding liquid, then
mix some of this bonding liquid in with the new concrete before
pouring it into the form. Trowel off at the surface and keep the
new patch slightly damp for at least 24 hours. Don't remove the
form boards for at least two or three days.
</P>
<P>
   Questions about home-repair problems should be addressed to
Bernard Gladstone, care of The New York Times Syndication Sales
Corp., 122 E. 42nd St., New York, N.Y. 10168. Questions of general

 &HT;    STATES LARGELY INEFFECTIVE IN HALTING TEEN SMOKING, STUDY SAYS
 &HT;    By Raven Hill
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   States still haven't cracked down on tobacco sales to minors,
despite federal regulations that require them to do so, according
to a study released on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Based on an analysis of 1997 data from 59 states and territories
on their efforts to decrease tobacco sales to minors, the study
concluded that a 1992 federal law banning tobacco sales to minors
has not been adequately enforced by states of the U.S. Department
of Health and Human Services.
</P>
<P>
   The study appear in this month's issue of the Archives of
Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine, an American Medical Association
journal.
</P>
<P>
   In an evaluation of Health and Human Services performance, the
study found the department has not ``effectively required states to
enforce their laws, implemented timelines set down by the law, or
sanctioned states that fail to meet federal requirements.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia and Texas, in fact, were found to have laws that
hindered enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very few states have implemented effective enforcement
programs, and national surveys confirm that there has been no
measurable reduction in the availability of tobacco to youths,''
said one researcher, Dr. Joseph R. DiFranza, professor of Family
Medicine and Community Health at the University of Massachusetts
Medical School.
</P>
<P>
   This is largely the result of loopholes in various state
regulations and the lack of penalties imposed on merchants who
violate the law, DiFranza said. However, in a letter written to
DiFranza, Department of Human and Health Services Administrator
Linda Chavez expressed concern that the study was not an accurate
depiction of enforcement. Enforcement data over the past few years
has been ``extremely successful'' in achieving its goals, Chavez
wrote, asserting that states continue to improve their laws.
</P>
<P>
   According to Chavez, estimated average retailer sales rates to
minors in 1998 was 25 percent, down from approximately 40 percent
in 1997. The federal goal is for all states to have a 20 percent or
less inspection failure rate by 2003. Almost 20 states have
achieved that goal, Chavez said.
</P>
<P>
   Florida, the only state to report a ``significant decline'' in
teenage smoking, has taken numerous steps to address the issue,
DiFranza said. It has increased the number of full-time inspectors
assigned to monitor retailers and imposed penalties on violators,
which have helped to decrease the state's violation rate to 5
percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
   DiFranza said the average violation rate should be 10 percent if
states plan to meet the 2003 deadline. He recommended that states
allocate more funds to attacking the problem and encouraged more
aggressive enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard for me to understand how you can enforce a law if
there are no penalties. It defies common sense,'' he said.

EDWARD GOREY'S A `MYSTERY' TO MOST, BUT THAT MAY CHANGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TODD CAMP 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Author/illustrator Edward Gorey isn't quite right ... which
probably explains my complete and utter fascination with him.
</P>
<P>
   He fills a corner of a room in my house reserved for what I like
to call my ``darker collections'' with his odd assortment of tiny,
hand-size digest books, little story books, oversized poster books
as well as an assortment of other Gorey tchotchkes, from stuffed
bats to miniature coffins. They seem in perfect company with the
Aurora monster model kits and Day of the Dead knickknacks that
clutter the place.
</P>
<P>
   Gorey has toiled in the business for almost 50 years, producing
as many books and an astounding amount of ephemera, but he still
feels like my own secret discovery. That's nonsense, of course. His
books are phenomenally popular (and pricey for avid collectors),
yet national celebrity seems to have escaped him entirely. The only
identifying connection that most people can make to him comes from
his animated title segment on the PBS series ``Mystery.''
</P>
<P>
   That kind of pop-culture obscurity makes him a tough sell for
trend-hungry editors. Thank goodness for Our Endeavors Theater
Company's production of ``Gorey Stories,'' a musical based on 18 of
Gorey's most memorable works. It opens Thursday at Dallas' Deep
Ellum Center for the Arts. Even better, the production will be
accompanied by ``Goreality,'' an exhibit of original Gorey artwork
and rare prints culled from his official archivists at New York's
Gotham Book Mart along with local and San Francisco-area
collectors.
</P>
<P>
   Our Endeavors artisic director and ``Gorey Stories'' director
Scott Osborne recalls discovering Gorey almost six years ago after
receiving a copy of ``The Gashlycrumb Tinies'' from a cast member.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, his discovery of the extent of Gorey's outstanding
career has been ``like peeling an onion.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's thematically ideal for this time of year,'' Osborne says,
``both humorous and horrific at the same time. And there's a lot of
room to put our own imprint on the work and still have Edward
Gorey's images filter through. Each story has its own flavor and
style of presentation.''
</P>
<P>
   Even a casual examination of Gorey's cautionary tales of hapless
children, tragic ballerinas, hungry insect gods and loathsome,
murderous couples would lead one to make several assumptions:
</P>
<P>
   1. He's twisted. Although most of Gorey's work appears perfectly
suited to kids, the younger of the species remain his most frequent
victims. One of his most famous works, ``The Gashlycrumb Tinies,''
is a rhyming alphabet of children who meet unfortunate ends.
</P>
<P>
   2. He's British. His figures have the pasty-white, overdressed,
slightly Victorian feel we've come to associate with Brits, and
their speech is achingly proper.
</P>
<P>
   3. He's dead. His works have a dated, antique feel, as if
uncovered among dusty, arcane volumes in a cramped, overstuffed,
forgotten bookstore.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, you know what they say about assuming. He may very
well be twisted, but his ebony sense of humor has influenced a
generation of artists, from the wickedly funny cartoons of Gahan
Wilson to the mirthfully macabre films of Tim Burton _ whose
``Nightmare Before Christmas'' seems an obvious tribute to Gorey
sensibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and yes, he is very much alive and still quite prolific. His
next book _ ``The Headless Bust,'' a sequel to last year's
Christmas tale, ``The Haunted Tea Cozy'' _ is due in stores in
early November.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago native claims never to have visited England, and
rarely strays from his weathered 19th-century cottage on Cape Cod.
Apart from his days as an avid patron of the New York City Ballet,
dressed in a floor-length fur coat and sneakers (a look that
frequently appears in his stories), Gorey spends much of his time
at home, reading and, dare I say it, watching television. His
lawyer, Graham Coleman, claims that Gorey maintains a meticulous
library of videotaped programs, though he's unsure whether ``Buffy
the Vampire Slayer'' is one of them.
</P>
<P>
   And now it seems as if Gorey is finding new life among Gen X-ers
and post-Gen X-ers.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's driving (his popularity) is the under-30s,'' Coleman
says. ``His permanent gallery at the Gotham Book Mart in New York
is like a pilgrimage for them. The folks at Gotham tell me that
every time someone with spiky hair walks in, or someone who looks
like they just got off the train from prep school, you know they're
there on a Gorey pilgrimage.''
</P>
<P>
   Coleman says that Gorey Web sites have sprung up like
toadstools, prompting him to politely police sites that get a
little too enthusiastic. Most fans, however, are usually eager to
comply and refrain from reprinting the entire contents of books.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of them love that they've gotten the notice from someone
who works for the master,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   That fan base could grow if Gorey's next project comes to
fruition: an animated film in conjuncture with cartoon legend Chuck
Jones. Coleman says there is currently a deal to produce Gorey's
``The Doubtful Guest'' as either a short or as part of a Gorey
anthology series.
</P>
<P>
   ``That two masters of the line would come together is very
exciting to us,'' Colemen says.
</P>
<P>
   There's a part of me that's excited, too, yet I can't help but
feel a little sad. My secret discovery is soon not to be a secret
any longer.

LOOKING 'ROUND FOR A SQUARE CAKE PLATE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BEVERLY BUNDY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I received an e-mail from Tami Wadlington, who is looking for a
square cake keeper.
</P>
<P>
   ``The industry provides us with square cake pans and recipes,
yet no one seems to have a cake plate that we can keep them fresh
in,'' she writes.
</P>
<P>
   Well, look no more.
</P>
<P>
   The eBay Web site, that Internet source of all things wonderful,
often lists square cake keepers. In fact, I bought a lovely 1950s
chrome one recently for the bargain price of $5. (Shipping, of
course, is extra.) To find eBay, type www.ebay.com and you're in
business.

<P>
   _ Donna Green had a recipe for Luby's cucumber salad that
included vinegar, water and pickle juice in the dressing. I've
searched for this recipe in our computer library but can't locate
it. Perhaps a reader has a copy?
</P>
<P>
   _ Beverly Welch ate a chewy chocolate walnut cookie at Fort
Worth's Coffee Haus and says ``it's the best cookie I've ever
eaten.'' Unfortunately, Coffee Haus buys the cookie from an

UNDATED: a master's degree. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For Linda Pavlik, owner of the Fort Worth communications firm
Pavlik &AMP; Associates, the nature of the job she loves means
unusually long hours. ``Night meetings, weekend meetings, breakfast
meetings, daylong retreats,'' she says. ``If you're going to
participate in public policy and the making of public policy, that
is when people meet.''
</P>
<P>
   But cultural attitudes toward work may be changing, notes Greg
Stephens, an associate professor of management at Texas Christian
University in Fort Worth. Research examining workers' commitments
to their jobs shows that fewer people are equating long hours at
work with a high level of commitment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today people say, `I can be very committed for eight hours a
day' '' and still be a valuable employee, Stephens notes.
</P>
<P>
   Adrian Gonzalez wasn't consciously looking to change his hectic
pace. As the director of marketing and client relations for a
Dallas graphic-design firm, he was beginning his days with 7 a.m.
networking meetings and proofreading copy until the wee hours of
the night. ``It was a job that was your life,'' the 25-year-old
says.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez recently left the firm and took a temp job that has him
working from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. ``It's like nothing I've ever done,''
he says. ``I get my hour lunch, I don't take (the work) home with
me, and nothing around here is'' a matter of life and death.
</P>
<P>
   ``I honestly will never work that hard again,'' Gonzalez says.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are those people choosing to leave the workplace
altogether. In September, Terri Buggs, a financial analyst for 16
years, quit to stay at home with her 6-year-old. She is expecting
another child in January.
</P>
<P>
   Buggs and her husband, who live in Arlington, Texas, met with a
financial analyst to help them develop a new budget. ``It's going
to be tougher,'' she says. ``But I think all of our needs will be
supplied.''
</P>
<P>
   Emerson and Eurotas admit to pining for saner schedules _ time
to give to their families or other interests. But Weinstein of UNT
sees no alternative but to keep putting in the long days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time I complain about my job, my son asks, `Why don't
you retire?' '' Weinstein says, ``And I say, `I wouldn't know what
to do with myself.' ''

REVVING UP THE RAT RACE: AMERICANS ARE WORKING MORE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LIZ STEVENS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ralph Emerson Jr. makes sure he eats breakfast with his
16-year-old son every morning and checks in with him each afternoon
after school. On the days that son Ralph plays basketball for his
high-school team, Emerson's schedule is uncompromising: He's at the
game.
</P>
<P>
   Other than that, his days are defined by his most time-consuming
responsibility by far: work.
</P>
<P>
   Emerson is pastor of Rising Star Missionary Baptist Church in
Fort Worth, and, like those of increasing numbers of Americans, his
workweek easily exceeds the traditional 40 hours.
</P>
<P>
   In September, a study released by the United Nations
International Labour Organization showed that Americans spend more
time on the job than employees in any other industrialized nation:
1,966 hours a year. That's more than the Germans, more than the
French and more than the notoriously workaholic Japanese.
</P>
<P>
   Why this is so, and what the repercussions are _ even whether
the latest statistics are accurate _ are matters of debate among
economists and sociologists. It's probably safe to say, at the very
least, that Americans feel as if they're working more. A minority
are even consciously cutting back.
</P>
<P>
   Not Emerson, who arrives at the office by 8:30 a.m. and often
gets home after 10 p.m. In the evenings, he attends board meetings
and makes house visits. But Emerson is dedicated to his job, he
says, ``so I don't put in those hours and complain.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts attribute the steady rise in American work hours to
numerous things. Women are putting in more hours on the job. In a
booming economy, there's more work to be done. Employees are
attempting to learn and keep up with new technologies, and that
takes time.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate downsizing has left fewer people to do the same amount
of work, notes Dr. Joyce Williams, chairman of the department of
sociology and social work at Texas Woman's University in Denton,
Texas. And, for hourly workers especially, she suggests, keeping up
with the cost of living means working overtime or working more than
one job.
</P>
<P>
   In some sectors, the competition for good jobs puts pressure on
employees to excel.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a high level of expectation,'' says a 39-year-old
professional woman who works in Fort Worth, Texas, and asked to
remain anonymous. ``The bar keeps getting raised, and you do
whatever you have to do to get over that bar.''
</P>
<P>
   To keep profits steady, this woman's employer has had to cut
overhead _ i.e. staff _ and now she works her job and someone
else's. She averages 10-hour days and at least one full weekend
day. And when she doesn't go into the office on a Saturday or
Sunday, she feels queasy about it on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In the long run, she believes, her hard work will pay off. ``At
a higher level, you can shape your own destiny a little more,'' she
says.
</P>
<P>
   Not everybody is convinced that Americans are working more. In
1997, authors John Robinson and Geoffrey Godbey purported in ``Time
for Life'' that Americans have more free time now than they've had
in the past 30 years. Their findings were so controversial that it
took the pair five years to find a publisher.
</P>
<P>
   Economists have generally accepted the ILO statistics, with
differing reactions. When Bernard Weinstein hears about the boost
in American work hours, he sees sunny economic skies. We might be
working more, ``but we're also making more money and we're getting
wealthier,'' says Weinstein, director of the center for economic
development at the University of North Texas in Denton and a
professor of applied economics.
</P>
<P>
   At the other end of the debate, Juliet Schor sees a potential
maelstrom. The author of 1991's ``The Overworked American,'' Schor
raised a red flag about the effects of longer workplace hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have paid a price for prosperity,'' she wrote then.
``Capitalism has brought a dramatically increased standard of
living, but at the cost of a much more demanding work life.'' This,
she suggested, ``has contributed to a variety of social problems''
_ like stress, sleep deprivation and a perceived breakdown in
family life.
</P>
<P>
   But there may be a whole newer dimension as to why Americans'
workdays are getting longer: It's possible that we like our jobs
more.
</P>
<P>
   ``We spend most of our waking hours working, and for most
people, work is one of the major fulfillments in life,'' Williams
notes. Among sociologists, there is speculation that ``we are less
inclined to look to family and relationships for our only
satisfaction.'' Research, she says, shows that this is especially
true among younger generations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the work I do,'' says Gloria Eurotas, assistant
director for the Fort Worth Housing Department. ``I like being in
an executive position and to be challenged, and I don't like to be
stagnant and bored.''
</P>
<P>
   Eurotas, who is single, will work four out of five Saturdays
this month. Since March, she has been doing her job plus the job of
a subordinate whom the department has yet to replace. And she just
started pursuing a master's degree.

   LIMERICK, Ireland _ Seamus McGarry took a break Wednesday
morning from scraping the dirt from a roadside gutter to study the
parade of stout young men in navy warm-ups board a large white bus.
</P>
<P>
   The bus waited by a grassy playing field set in a hillside at
Limerick University. ``It's the Americans that's boarding that
coach,'' McGarry remarked to a co-worker, who then paused to lean
on his shovel and have a look. The members of USA Rugby had just
finished their morning practice session in preparation for their
World Cup match Thursday against Australia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Poor dears,'' McGarry said, offering his own expert analysis.
``The Aussies will be too much for them, I'm afraid. But its
Limerick that will be for them. Limerick loves the underdog.''
</P>
<P>
   Limerick, meet USA Rugby.
</P>
<P>
   Barring a miracle. No, barring many, many miracles, the U.S.
rugby team will exit the World Cup tournament Thursday after being
drubbed by one of the best teams on Earth. Imagine the Atlanta
Braves playing an amateur team of deeply devoted yet inexperienced
players from, say, Australia. No, it's worse than that. In August,
Team USA was swatted by Team England 106-8.
</P>
<P>
   In their first World Cup match, they were beaten 53-8 by Ireland
_ a fact that may be contributing to the generous spirit in
Limerick.
</P>
<P>
   If the situation doesn't seem sufficiently dire, then let's
strip the underdogs of their best player. Dan Lyle, a former
football standout at Atlanta's Woodward Academy, will be sidelined
with a separated shoulder. A popular professional who plays for the
tough Bath, England, club, Lyle has been the team's captain and
wizened father. He is one of only four professionals on a team that
also includes computer software salesmen, students, teachers, a
miner, chiropractor and a few guys who will be looking for work
when they get home.
</P>
<P>
   Lyle, 29, was forced out of last Saturday's bitter 27-25 loss to
Romania, which was the team's best and so far only opportunity.
Team USA is 1-7 in World Cup competition since 1987.
</P>
<P>
   The team also will be without former University of Georgia
football star Richard Tardits, who returned home to Marietta, Ga.,
for personal reasons.
</P>
<P>
   If the Americans can manage a score against the Australians it
will be a cause for celebration.
</P>
<P>
   But when it comes to rugby _ a game that looks like the love
child of American football and soccer _ Limerick celebrates easily.
The town considers itself the sport's spiritual center.
</P>
<P>
   ``What all the people are talking these days is rugby,'' said
John Wallace, a taxi driver who figures the World Cup has flooded
the town of 50,000 with visitors.
</P>
<P>
   Rugby seems the perfect game for this once desperately poor town
that provided author Frank McCourt a childhood miserable enough to
frame his sad and heralded autobiography ``Angela's Ashes.'' (There
is an ``Angela's Ashes'' walking tour.)
</P>
<P>
   While the wounds of poverty still mark the gray old city,
Limerick also sports fresh signs of wealth. The city is capturing
more than its of the boom that President Clinton when he visited
last year called the ``Celtic Tiger.'' All around town there is new
construction. Many of the streets are recently resurfaced and many
main roads are lined by freshly planted trees. For this long
suffering place, the Rugby World Cup means as much as the Olympic
Games to a bigger city. In truth, the rugby championship is No. 3
on the list of the world's most popular televised sporting events
behind the Olympics and soccer's World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   The aura has infused the Americans. ``Limerick is buzzing,''
said Lyle during a conversation in the lobby of the fancy new
Castletroy Park Hotel, the team's home here. ``Everywhere you go
you're surrounded by knowledgeable rugby people. You wake up in the
morning and read the newspaper and watch TV and you learn something
about the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Lyle is one of the handful of U.S. players, who look like
throwbacks to gridiron players of the 1940s, with significant
international experience. A massive man at 6-foot-4 and 245 pounds,
Lyle was a college football standout at Virginia Military Institute
who rejected a contract with the Minnesota Vikings to play pro
rugby.
</P>
<P>
   He lives much of the year in tourist mecca Bath, where he is
revered for his unbridled play and All-American style.
</P>
<P>
   His example feeds the notion that you could assemble a
world-beating rugby team from the hundreds of gifted college
athletes who fall just short of professional football standards in
America.
</P>
<P>
   Lyle and others with the team say it's not that easy, however.
The essential framework for recruiting, playing and developing
doesn't now exist in the United States. But it is beginning, and
the exposure given Team USA this year has helped.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Clark, the team's coach, believes just being in the World
Cup is an accomplishment. The team beat Tonga, Fiji and Canada to
get here.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States of America is in the world championship of
rugby, and we qualified to get here,'' Clark said in a lightly
attended news conference Wednesday. ``Though boys have played not
always precise rugby, we've left our hearts on the field each time
out. I'm very proud of them and so is America.''
</P>
<P>
   And the future for U.S. rugby is bright, he said. ``For the
first time in our world cup experiences, I think we can identify 10
to 20 players who could see action in the next world cup, and
obviously by that time will have the experience level to make a
mark on the tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   But Thursday is likely to belong to the Australians _ even if
the Irish hearts are with the Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, even in Limerick, there is a glint of pleasure in watching
the Yanks _ who have come to dominate so much in Europe _ get a
lesson in humility.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, you wouldn't think the Americans would be needing to
learn about anything,'' said Damien Duffy, taking a slow frothy sip
from a pint of Guinness in Thady O'Neill's pub on the Ennis Road.
``But I'm thinking it's rugby that still has a few lessons in it.''

   The mom's knees were scrunched under a too-small desk and her
torso towered over it, a fact that seemed to add to the intensity
of her voice as she leaned toward her daughter. ``Katherine, don't
be a doormat. Never be a doormat. Don't let people walk all over
you.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a parent-child-teacher conference many years ago, back
when I was on the side representing an organization of learning. I
wasn't a mother yet _ and moms intrigued me. Why was this one so
upset with her daughter? The little girl, Katherine, was a
strong-willed, confident middle-schooler, the kind of student we
all want our daughters to be.
</P>
<P>
   This mom wasn't really talking about her daughter, I thought
smugly. This is all about her and her self-confidence issues
instead.
</P>
<P>
   I won't be like that when I'm a mom, I thought. I won't confuse
my issues with my daughter's. When I'm a mother, it clearly won't
be about me ...
</P>
<P>
   ELEVEN YEARS AND TWO CHILDREN LATER
</P>
<P>
   ``Who's the prettiest girl?'' I ask my daughter. We're on the
way to school,and she looks to me like an American version of
Madeleine with her navy school jumper and Peter Pan-collared white
blouse. ``I am,'' she replies, because she knows this game seems to
make me happy.
</P>
<P>
   And it apparently does make me happy, because I do it all the
time, without thinking. I tell my 6-year-old she's pretty in the
morning when I kiss her to wake her up. I tell her as a consolation
after I torture her by brushing her hair. I tell her when she plays
fairy, when she emerges from a bubbly bath, when she puts on her
Barbie nightgown, or even when she's biting her toenails. ``You're
so pretty, Hadley,'' I say.
</P>
<P>
   I guess it makes me happy. It also makes me sick.
</P>
<P>
   I noticed this most recently last week, when Hadley, her older
brother, Jack, and I were engaged in a cutthroat Pretty Pretty
Princess competition. In case you aren't aware of this latest
offering from the masterminds at Milton Bradley, the object of the
game is to acquire all the pieces of jewelry in your special color
_ and the bejeweled crown. If you do so, and avoid the evil black
ring, then you turn the spinner over, look in the mirror and see
just how pretty you, the winner, are.
</P>
<P>
   Jack won, and as he swung his blue, beaded earrings back and
forth, laughing at his own image, it was all fun. But then Hadley
won the second game, and as she gazed at her reflection, serenely
studying her pretty self, suddenly I wasn't smiling.
</P>
<P>
   Here's what I thought: I'm raising a girl who cares too much
about what she _ and other people _ look like. I am, in truth,
raising myself. I'm breeding a little ``lookist.'' It wasn't a
pretty thought _ and it wasn't the first time I'd thought it.
</P>
<P>
   Be like me. Be like me. It's a message I've subconciously sent
my kids since the moment they were born. I dress them in Gap capris
and khakis that look like miniature versions of my own. I take
Hadley with me for manicures. I put them both in T-shirts
emblazoned with the name of my alma mater. I play them the songs I
love in the car, encourage them to watch reruns of the Bradys and
make them dance when they're feeling stressed _ just like I do. I
adore these newer, smaller, more perfect mirror images of myself _
these living, breathing conceits over which I believe I have some
control.
</P>
<P>
   Until the illusion shatters. Inevitably, my kids reflect back
something I don't like. Some less pretty side of myself that makes
me wonder, ``What have I wrought?'' And makes me think with fury:
``Don't be like me. Don't be like me.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't be like me, Hadley, because I know what that's like, and
frankly it isn't easy sometimes. You'll end up buying $100 worth of
makeup from a salesman who tells you that your eyes are beautiful.
You'll have great shoes, but a fence that needs repair. You'll fall
for nice-looking men who tell you that you look good but who in the
end seem to have the self-awareness of a Ziploc bag.
</P>
<P>
   Was it too late for Hadley? I worried about this for days after
the Pretty Pretty Princess episode, obsessing over the matter until
at last I decided to test her, to see how deep my pretty poison had
sunk.
</P>
<P>
   I put the question to my daughter point-blank: ``Is it better to
be pretty or smart?''
</P>
<P>
   Hadley looked at me for a few seconds and then laughed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mom, it's better to be snuggly,'' she said. ``And to have a
happy family.''
</P>
<P>
   Whew. At least Hadley hasn't confused my issues with her own.
For now, this love-hate relationship with all things pretty is
clearly all about me. .MDBR/.MDBO/.MDNM/ (Visit the Star-Telegram's

<P>
   The mom's knees were scrunched under a too-small desk and her
torso towered over it, a fact that seemed to add to the intensity
of her voice as she leaned toward her daughter. ``Katherine, don't
be a doormat. Never be a doormat. Don't let people walk all over
you.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a parent-child-teacher conference many years ago, back
when I was on the side representing an organization of learning. I
wasn't a mother yet _ and moms intrigued me. Why was this one so
upset with her daughter? The little girl, Katherine, was a
strong-willed, confident middle-schooler, the kind of student we
all want our daughters to be.
</P>
<P>
   This mom wasn't really talking about her daughter, I thought
smugly. This is all about her and her self-confidence issues
instead.
</P>
<P>
   I won't be like that when I'm a mom, I thought. I won't confuse
my issues with my daughter's. When I'm a mother, it clearly won't
be about me ...
</P>
<P>
   ELEVEN YEARS AND TWO CHILDREN LATER
</P>
<P>
   ``Who's the prettiest girl?'' I ask my daughter. We're on the
way to school,and she looks to me like an American version of
Madeleine with her navy school jumper and Peter Pan-collared white
blouse. ``I am,'' she replies, because she knows this game seems to
make me happy.
</P>
<P>
   And it apparently does make me happy, because I do it all the
time, without thinking. I tell my 6-year-old she's pretty in the
morning when I kiss her to wake her up. I tell her as a consolation
after I torture her by brushing her hair. I tell her when she plays
fairy, when she emerges from a bubbly bath, when she puts on her
Barbie nightgown, or even when she's biting her toenails. ``You're
so pretty, Hadley,'' I say.
</P>
<P>
   I guess it makes me happy. It also makes me sick.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Colette said that you shouldn't eat truffles unless
you can eat them like potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   She would have loved the 1999 French Designer Showhouse, which
opens Thursday at 34 E. 69th St. It would stop a rooting pig. All
the luxuries, both material and ephemeral, that the French hold
dear are there in spades. Walking up through the five floors of
decorated rooms and landings is like spending too much money on a
short holiday in Paris in boutiques, hotels and restaurants.
Soignee as Seyrig, handsome as Deneuve, it's fun, but it's heady.
The house looks like a pile of the best shopping bags at the end of
an exceptionally self-rewarding day. This would not be a cheap
divorce.
</P>
<P>
   The effect is not inappropriate to the address of this year's
show: the residence of the consul general of Iran, until it was
seized by the U.S. government in 1980. The State Department rented
it to the show house committee for the month.
</P>
<P>
   If there are fabrics employed, they are silk and velvet in the
most fragile colors, like the tips of Abyssinian-cat hair, or
leather and fur in the most unnatural. If there is ambiance, it is
layer upon layer of wealth, whether subtle or not, coquettish or
unconcealed. For every muted wall treatment, like the two weeks'
worth of gesso-work in Brigitte Saby's quiet-hued, platinum bedroom
or the precious metallic powder mixed into the Benjamin Moore in
Jennifer Ellenberg and Jane Victor's bronze bedroom, there is an
unequivocal cream of pumpkin, like Florence de Dampierre's orange
dressing room for an Anglophilic fetishist.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. de Dampierre's fantasy client has a wardrobe of
caramel-colored bikers' caps that would look good on
St.-Germain-des-Pres, bespoke suits with both trousers and skirts,
high heels and brogues.
</P>
<P>
   Like much of the show house, it has the wit of seduction, which
is decoration practiced at its most professional. Send the bill.
</P>
<P>
   There is much high couture and haute cuisine, all the
dress-fitting and sauce-making expected of the French. Jacques
Garcia's salon has more fabric panels than a Balenciaga, more
braiding and trim than a Lacroix. The warm chestnut browns and
pheasant beiges of Madeleine and Jean-Louis Mellerio's study has
the nuanced richness of a reduced stock.
</P>
<P>
   If there is any much-talked-about globalization or fusion
influence, it is in the roster of designers, from Frenchmen working
in New York, like Garcia, to Italians working in Paris, like the
Mellerios, to Ms. Saby, who has the only decorator's office in
Moscow, period.
</P>
<P>
   As quickly as they are crossing the map, they are also crossing
periods and styles, now as a matter of course. There seems more
fashionable correctness than precociousness or controversy in
Olivier Gelbsmann's dining room table, set with 18th-century French
porcelain and midcentury-modern Italian glass. Or in the Verner
Panton white plastic chairs that sit like Courreges boots across
Paul Mathieu's boiserie-paneled library from a grand piano. A
flat-screen television blocking the marble fireplace mouth projects
a videotape of Alain Resnais' ``Last Year at Marienbad,'' a
cineaste's vision of artificial logs.
</P>
<P>
   Like French couture and cuisine, the show house also has its
ready-to-wear ideas and its recipes for the home cook. Richard
Mishaan's artist's atelier is wallpapered in pool-table felt, at
$11 a yard. Christopher Coleman's contemporary kitchen cabinetry is
standard Ikea and stainless steel restaurant supply, combined for a
custom look. There is hope for the rest of us.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to know if the news, the direction, the millennial
moment of the French Designer Showhouse is a condemned man's meal
or the start of something great _ they're both parts of a
revolution _ but the message is, clearly, to enjoy, which isn't a
question of money exclusively. It's a question of learning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds nice, `the 21st century,''' said Mathieu, unshaven
like Rip Van Winkle, and dressed in brown, sitting on the sofa in
his futuristic library watching the stylish sleepwalkers in
Resnais' film.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that we are able to manage so much, such a wealth of
choices and technology and information,'' he said, ``now we need
poetry. And peace.''
</P>
<P>
   The French Designer Showhouse, at 34 E. 69th St., is open
through Nov. 14; hours are 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily, until 8 p.m. on
Thursdays. Admission, $20, benefits the American Hospital in Paris.

 &HT;    SENATORS START DRIVE FOR SCHOOL PESTICIDE LAW
 &HT;    460&AMP;add.
 &HT;    With photos.
 &HT;    By ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Jesse Rifkin was 8 when his grade school in
Annapolis, Md., was sprayed with a pesticide.
</P>
<P>
   Jesse, now 13, said Wednesday that as he left his classroom that
day and went out the door, ``I began to feel red, hot and itchy. My
throat was closing up and I had trouble breathing.''
</P>
<P>
   Jesse had been moderately asthmatic since he was exposed four
years earlier in Los Angeles to a similar pesticide sprayed to kill
fruit flies, and his mother recognized the symptoms as he
approached her car. She quickly gave him a pill that kept him from
going into full-fledged anaphylactic shock.
</P>
<P>
   ``Though I was the only kid who reacted that severely that day,
quite a few students and parents felt pretty ill after that
exposure,'' Jesse said.
</P>
<P>
   His mother brought Jesse to Capitol Hill to join the National
PTA and groups of environmentalists, pediatricians and teachers in
helping Sens. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., and Patty Murray, D-Wash.,
launch a national crusade for uniform pesticide safety rules for
schools.
</P>
<P>
   The School Environment Protection Act proposed by the senators
would ban use of some toxic pesticides in schools and require
schools to first use the safest methods of pest-fighting, such as
filling in cracks or avoiding food spills that attract pests.
</P>
<P>
   If mild methods don't work, schools would have to post signs and
send notices to parents, guardians and teachers one to four days
before applying conventional pesticides. The notice would have to
list potential side effects.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal is ``misguided,'' said Allen James, executive
director of RISE, an association of pesticide makers, formulators
and distributors. He said that by making pest control less
effective, the bill would ``put children at risk for a variety of
major diseases and illnesses'' associated with cockroaches, fire
ants, wasps, mosquitoes, poison oak and ivy, rats and mice.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main risk would be weeds,'' scoffed Torricelli, who said
risky pesticides often are used to beautify campuses and playing
fields.
</P>
<P>
   To notify each parent or guardian before each application ``is a
little burdensome and cumbersome, and it unnecessarily worries
parents,'' said Gene Harrington, manager of government affairs for
the National Pest Control Association, an alliance of pest control
firms.
</P>
<P>
   Dismissing his concern, Murray said, ``It is the right of every
parent to know what their child is exposed to on the playground or
in school.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows)
</P>
<P>
   Harrington's group prefers laws like those in Texas, which was
the first state to require that schools offer parents or guardians
a chance once a year to sign up to be notified each time a
pesticide is applied.
</P>
<P>
   That wouldn't help parents who don't suspect that their child's
symptoms are related to pesticides, Murray replied.
</P>
<P>
   Laws similar to the Torricelli-Murray bill were adopted in
Maryland last year and in Connecticut this year. In California,
Gov. Gray Davis vetoed a similar bill this week on the grounds that
it had technical flaws.
</P>
<P>
   Anticipating a long fight, Torricelli acknowledged that the bill
won't be adopted in this Congress. The U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency has yet to respond to a petition by the National
Coalition Against Misuse of Pesticides to impose similar
regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Torricelli said that he and Murray hope that their bill will
inspire parents across the land to join their crusade to put
pressure on Congress for a new law.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thirty states have taken leadership, having some form of
protection for children from pesticides,'' he said. ``But they are
almost all different, sometimes contradictory and without any
uniformity.''
</P>
<P>
   Even today, he said, 20 states and most school districts ``have
not addressed this problem and do not even know that it exists.''

</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Story was slugged ORVIS-BOOK-REVIEW on the
ENTERTAINMENT-BUDGET.) 
 (DW) 
 By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``A jerk on one end of a line waiting for a jerk on the other,''
is the classic folk definition of fishing that explains the title
of Robert Hughes' witty testimonial to the sport, ``A Jerk on One
End: Reflections of a Mediocre Fisherman.''
</P>
<P>
   A jerk is what the author often enough feels like, he implies.
``All in all,'' he writes, ``were I to amortize the market value of
the fish I catch in a year against the expense of catching them, I
would say I was spending about $55 per pound on bluefish, which,
scaled and filleted, can be had in the local store for about
$3.99.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hughes _ who was born in Sydney, Australia, and has lived
and worked in the United States since 1970 as art critic for Time
magazine _ also manages to convey why not only he but also many
other human beings are happy to make jerks of themselves pursuing
fish.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fundamental experience of fishing consists of dropping a
line into the unknown,'' he writes. ``You can guess at what is down
there; you can make your best estimates based on tide, habitat,
feeding patterns and so forth; but you do not really know. ... It
may be edible or not; thorny, spiny or beautifully sleek; equipped
with gnashing jaws or relatively passive; but there is always,
assuming you aren't sight-fishing, the magic moment when the thing
struggling on your line down there could be anything.''
</P>
<P>
   What's more, he plunges himself into many of the mysteries of
fishing and emerges with plausible explanations. He asks, for
instance, why the fishing reel was used in China some four
centuries before it appeared in England, and suggests that
``because fishing in China was a high-class sport as well as common
work, Chinese anglers were far ahead of European techniques.''
</P>
<P>
   He explores how fly fishing for trout came to be regarded as
superior to all other ways of angling, and concludes: ``As the
English countryside was transformed by the Industrial Revolution,
both the old landed gentry and the new mercantile one whose coal
mines and iron works were fouling the streams and blackening the
meadows of an earlier England naturally wanted their own unpolluted
crystal rills, the image of whose purity was the trout.'' To catch
them on a fly became ``a stylistic imperative, a sign of class.''
</P>
<P>
   He inquires why anglers pursue tarpon when that fish has so
little value as food. And answers: ``The jump of a tarpon is
startling and scary. It can go as high as 10 feet. The fish
explodes out of the water, twisting and whipping, a column of
quicksilver in a storm of foam. It is an epiphany.''
</P>
<P>
   One benefit of fishing he disputes is an early English writer's
assertion that angling can make one rich. To the contrary, Hughes
writes, ``the only people who have ever made a buck off amateur
fishing are the makers of fishing gear.'' As if to prove this
point, in ``A Sportsman's Life: How I Built Orvis by Mixing
Business and Sport,'' Leigh Perkins tells how he transformed a
small fishing-equipment company into a $200-million-a-year
mail-order business.
</P>
<P>
   Perkins attributes his success largely to luck: the luck to have
been born wealthy, an heir to the fortune built by the
industrialist Mark Hanna; the luck to have bought Orvis out of a
love for fishing and hunting instilled in him by his devoted
mother; and the luck to have presided over his company in the era
when the computer, the credit card and the overnight
package-delivery system arrived.
</P>
<P>
   But to judge from his lively account, it was more than luck that
led him to prepare himself by working for 12 years in the mining
and welding-equipment businesses; that allowed him to buy Orvis out
of his own earnings rather than his inheritance; that helped him to
overcome the resistance to new ideas in a company that tended to
look down on its customers; and that inspired him to invent the
Orvis zinger, the little reel with the spring-loaded retractable
wire that attaches clippers and other useful small tools to the
vests of virtually every fly fisherman wading a stream these days.
</P>
<P>
   The fun of reading ``A Sportsman's Life'' is watching a company
best known for selling good fly rods grow into an emporium from
which you could order what Perkins proudly refers to as ``a kind of
Americanized version of elegant, English country living,'' or what
Hughes calls ``the whole Victorian-Edwardian Bushido of
fine-tackle, dry-fly fishing.''
</P>
<P>
   Less entertaining are Perkins' accounts of fishing and hunting
in exotic places, and his general air of satisfaction with all
things, which embrace even the future of endangered animal species.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes is not so optimistic. He doesn't blame the sport
fisherman, whom he exhorts to embrace moderation. But to save the
world's oceans he calls for an understanding of aquatic otherness
that rather takes away the mystery of the deep. Read ``A
Sportsman's Life'' and you will rejoice in fishing lines that jerk.
But read Hughes' book, where the author concludes that ``as one
gets older one views all death with less indifference,'' and you
will sense that the jerk holding the line has wised up and feels a
little less like fishing.

   WASHINGTON, Oct.13 -- Rep. Solomon Ortiz, D-Corpus Christi, was
named one of the top 100 ``most influential Hispanics'' of 1999 by
Hispanic Business Magazine, which celebrated the Spanish-speaking
community's impact in the entertainment industry.
</P>
<P>
   The October issue of the magazine lauded the congressman for his
efforts to help increase Hispanic representation in the television,
movie and music businesses, and to address discrimination in that
industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm grateful that they think I've been able to do my job
here,'' said Ortiz, now in his 18th year in the House.
</P>
<P>
   From his seat on the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, Ortiz led a
task force last month addressing the discriminatory portrayal of
Hispanics in the movie and on television.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things we've wanted to do is see if the networks
can be more inclusive,'' he said, ``as far as allowing more
Hispanics to play roles, not only in front of the camera, but also
writers and producers.''
</P>
<P>
   The congressman said his Corpus Christi district has plenty of
Spanish-speaking talent, such as San Benito country singer and
actor Freddy Fender, entertainer Johnny Canales, and the father of
late pop singer Selena's, Abraham Quintanilla, who owns a recording
studio.
</P>
<P>
   However, the popularity of acts like these has yet to cross over
to the mainstream, Ortiz said. T.V. advertisers should recognize
their potential and tap into the Hispanic market, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got the infrastructure [in Corpus Christi], in the music
or the movie industries, to launch young Hispanics who are capable
of being an actor, a producer, or a guy behind the camera,'' Ortiz
said. ``But it stays within the Hispanic community.''
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz said he believes the networks would benefit from a more
visible Spanish-speaking community on television because of the
size of the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Hispanic population is growing by leaps and bounds,'' he
said. ``It's important for the networks to understand that this is
a two-way street.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Ortiz has avoided using federal legislation to increase
Hispanic representation, preferring to get to know media
corporations, and introduce them to Hispanic talent from within and
outside of his district. Taking a ``friendly'' approach toward the
movie business is useful to help Hispanics make job contacts, the
congressman said. ``I hope there isn't a need to introduce any type
of legislation,'' he said. ``Many doors have been opened.''
</P>
<P>
   The congressman's office has collaborated with IMAGEN, a
Hollywood organization aimed at helping Hispanics get into the
movie industry. The group will organize a job fair in January, 2000
to bring Hispanics and entertainment execs together.
</P>
<P>
   In a poll conducted by the magazine, almost all of them agreed
portrayal of Hispanics on T.V. and in the movies was
``stereotypical.''

SAVORING WORDS, PLAIN AND FANCY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio)   (js) 
 By BONNIE ROTHMAN MORRIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As a recent meeting broke up at Kaufman Patricof Enterprises in
New York, a company that designs Web sites and Internet
advertising, the five co-workers at the session discovered that in
addition to their corporate identification cards, they had another
thing in common. They are all fans of word-a-day Web sites and
e-mail newsletters for word-ophiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually, they are entirely impractical, fun words,'' said
Jason Hackett, 28, an account director at the firm, in an e-mail
message. Hackett has been a word lover since high school. The
word-a-day e-mail message he gets from Merriam-Webster Online
(www.m-w.com) does not have much to do with his actual work, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Merriam-Webster offers the plain vanilla version of word-a-day
services. Entries include a definition, a sentence using the word
and a brief discussion of the word's origin.
</P>
<P>
   The Oxford English Dictionary posts a word-a-day feature at its
Web site (www.oed.com/wordofday.htm), but you have to seek it out _
it is not sent via e-mail. Each exhaustive entry is reprinted
directly from the 20-volume Oxford English Dictionary.
</P>
<P>
   Other word sites offer snippets of English filtered through the
perspectives of various Webmasters, who include at least two
professional lexicographers as well as hobbyists.
</P>
<P>
   Anu Garg, who runs the Word a Day site
(www.wordsmith.org/awad &QC; /index.html), is a 32-year-old computer
scientist in Columbus, Ohio, who compares his love of discovering
new words to that of a philatelist finding a rare and beautiful
stamp. He said he had 235,000 subscribers to his word-a-day
service, which sends daily e-mail to subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   ``My hobby is words,'' said Garg, who moved to the United States
from India in 1991 and started A Word a Day in 1995 while he was a
graduate student at Case Western Reserve University. Every week
Garg chooses a theme and picks words around it. Recently the theme
was eponyms: Homeric, Molotov cocktail and John Hancock.
Pronunciations, recorded by Garg's wife, Stuti, can be downloaded.
</P>
<P>
   One attitude-infused site is called The Word Detective; the
Webmaster is Evan Morris, who writes a syndicated newspaper column
of the same name and says his site has 3,000 visitors each week
(www.word-detective.com). Morris, whose father, William Morris, was
editor in chief of the first edition of the American Heritage
Dictionary, writes jaunty essays to answer reader's queries. His
favorite work as a word sleuth is to delve into the origins of
phrases from childhood, like ``goody-two-shoes.''
</P>
<P>
   Morris recently snooped for the origins of ``to tie one on,''
``armed to the teeth'' and ``gold-bricking.''
</P>
<P>
   For more academic words, there is the Random House Dictionary's
word-a-day site, written by Jesse Sheidlower, a senior editor
(www.randomhouse.com/jesse). A recent offering explaining the
origin of the word ``spark,'' as it refers to the act of courting,
was introduced by a hearty paragraph exhorting the reader to share
Sheidlower's enthusiasm for Joni Mitchell's pop classic ``Court and
Spark.'' (Yes, he is paid to do this.)
</P>
<P>
   Michael Quinion is a word hobbyist whose approach is similar to
Sheidlower's, though Joni Mitchell has not surfaced in his work.
Quinion runs World Wide Words &UR;  &LR; (www.quinion.com/words), a
commercial-free site where visitors can sign up for his free
newsletter. Quinion is a freelance word sleuth for the Oxford
English Dictionary.
</P>
<P>
   Quinion's enormous site has more than 100,000 visitors a month,
Quinion said, and he sends his newsletter to 6,000 subscribers each
week. A recent favorite entry of his was ``smouch,'' an
18th-century slang term for imitation tea made from the dried
leaves of trees like hawthorne and ash. Whether the beverage tastes
better with milk or lemon was left to the reader's imagination.
</P>
<P>
   Like Morris, Quinion loves puzzling out the origin of phrases
like ``the whole nine yards.'' For the whole nine yards on the
subject, you can check

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARLETONVILLE, South Africa _ Ten women are striding up a dirt
road in this old mining town. Emily Ntsekawla is giggling, kicking
at weeds. Gladys Nicholas, all lipsticked up, is scanning the
distance. It's midafternoon. The air is clear and the ladies are
going to work.
</P>
<P>
   They reach an opening in the middle of the adjacent bush and
take seats on tin cans. A few have condoms in the palms of their
hands. There's a tall and lean miner coming just now. Nicholas
chats with the miner. Then she vanishes with him into the bush,
twisting like a schoolgirl.
</P>
<P>
   The women are prostitutes. And out here, in a stretch of rural
landscape about 45 miles west of Johannesburg, it is mean work.
Malaria-causing mosquitoes are one thing; the real possibility of
robbery another. But the most lethal revelation is this:
Carletonville has one of the highest rates of AIDS in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``In young women 25 years old and under, two out of three of
them are already infected with AIDS'' in Carletonville, says Brian
Williams, a researcher at the University of Pretoria who has been
studying the area for the past year. ``So, two out of three girls
will die before the age of 30.''
</P>
<P>
   Health offcials say prostitution is playing a key role in
fueling the AIDS crisis in sub-Saharan Africa.
</P>
<P>
   But Emily Ntsekawla, a prostitute who is 22, doesn't pay much
attention to statistics, or mortality rates. She's more concerned
with everyday survival out here in the bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you get somebody who takes your money and runs,''
she says.
</P>
<P>
   Thugs shot Ntsekawla six times earlier this year. ``I was
praying that God would take me,'' she says. ``I was in such pain.''
</P>
<P>
   Ntsekawla wears a crude surgically-implanted metal device in her
left arm that helps heal the bones that were shattered from the
shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is like a no man's land, so you have gangsters who put
themselves into a position of governing,'' says Zodwa Mzaidume, a
counselor with the Mothusimpilo Outreach Project, an AIDS
educational program funded by the American and British governments.
</P>
<P>
   Mzaidume has been teaching the women about safe sex practices.
Mzaidume confesses she can't watch every woman going into the bush,
and knows that not all of them will insist that the men use
condoms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody protects the women,'' she says. ``They are open to any
type of harassment _ police or criminal. Some guys even rape
them.''
</P>
<P>
   The women _ who prefer the title ``sex worker'' _ all live three
miles down the road, in Leeupoort, a squatter camp that one can
only enter by traversing wicked dirt roads. There is no electricity
or running water in Leeupoort. Someone has scrawled ``Tigers Don't
Cry'' on the side of one of the dwellings, as if to underscore that
this is no place for the faint of heart. There are 150 sex workers
who live in the squatter camp. Many have their children with them,
kids who can be seen scooting around in the dust during the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hot stuff is 20 rand,'' says Emily Ntsekawla. ``The cold
stuff is 6 rand.''
</P>
<P>
   The hot stuff is sex. The cold stuff is beer. Twenty rand is the
equivalent of about three American dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no time for intimacy,'' says Mzaidume, the outreach
counselor. ``It's pay and go.''
</P>
<P>
   Mzaidume is still grieving over Tstelele Phuteho. Phuteho drove
the van for her program, delivering condoms to the ladies in the
bush. Hoodlums robbed the condom deliverer and shot him dead in
April. ``I come in here knowing very well that something could
happen to me,'' Mzaidume says, after hiking into the bush one
recent afternoon to check on the women.
</P>
<P>
   They are never short of customers. There are three shifts of
miners at nearby Goldfields Mines, which employs more than 7,000
people. Most of the miners are migrants who live in hostels on the
mine company's property.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got men living in single-sex hostels without their
wives,'' says Williams, the University of Pretoria researcher.
``What do you think they're going to do, play backgammon?''
</P>
<P>
   Mzaidume has been dispensing more than 80,000 condoms a month,
trying to stem the staggering rate of AIDS infection in this area.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first met these sex workers,'' she says, ``they knew
nothing about AIDS or STD's (sexually transmitted diseases). It
took me three months to get them to accept me.''
</P>
<P>
   Xoliswa Jaho, who is 36, has worked here for three years, after
arriving from Cape Town. ``I was working in the kitchen of a
house,'' she says, adding that by working as a prostitute, she
easily quadruples the salary she would have made continuing to work
as a domestic.
</P>
<P>
   Khanyisiele Hlongwene, 23, says the work is not that grueling.
``Some men look at me and discharge before they even touch me,''
she says, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   Gladys Nicholas, whose family thinks she is scouring the
country, job hunting, has dreams. ``My dream is always to get a
better job than a sex worker,'' she says. ``I would like to have a
clerical job.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, Nicholas, Hlongwene, Jaho and the other women
here have had to dig into their savings for coffins and train fare.
Three of their colleagues fell dead from AIDS. The bodies had to be
shipped back to their families.

<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ When Tom Wolfe wrote about this gambling oasis in
the early 1960s, he reeled: ``Such colors! All the electrochemical
pastels of the Florida littoral.'' Today he would be struck dumb by
... such details! Las Vegas on the cusp of a new millennium is
decked out with all the frills of the Renaissance.
</P>
<P>
   As the garish neon signs of old give way to theme-park
evocations of the Old World, Las Vegas is reveling in a grand new
cityscape of aged walls, fake frescoes and acrylic ``marble.'' The
casino owners here are America's new Medici, proud patrons of the
flowering of a modern variant on old ornamental crafts.
</P>
<P>
   To ceiling painters, ``Vegas is the Vatican of the '90s,'' said
Karen Kristin, who owns Sky Art, an Englewood, Colo., company that
painted the ersatz St. Mark's Square at the Venetian casino resort
and the celestial vault that spans a canal there.
</P>
<P>
   The casinos are drawing talent from all over the globe in crafts
both old and new to make fake statuary (more than 10,000 pieces for
the ``landmarks'' on the facade of the Paris casino complex),
distress walls and concoct fancy plasterwork and ironwork. Like
itinerant painters, sculptors and woodcarvers plying their trade in
the courts of Europe, crafts workers have packed up their bags. All
roads lead to Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had people calling from all over the world,'' said Dave
Suder, the president of the West Coast division of KHS&AMP;S
contractors, which oversaw the exterior decoration of the Paris.
``They didn't quite understand the project. They thought we were
going to take real stone and carve real stone statues.'' Instead,
the ones at the Paris are carved from Styrofoam or cast in molds.
</P>
<P>
   The New York New York casino _ which opened in 1997 and is
themed from the top of its one-third-size Chrysler Building to the
tips of the distressed fake-copper toes on its Statue of Liberty _
set a benchmark for authenticity, but it was soon upstaged by the
Euro-style competition: the Bellagio, the Paris and the Venetian.
After New York New York opened, Sheldon Adelson, the owner of the
Venetian, dismissed it as a fake. ``We are not going to build a
`faux' Venice,'' he said. ``We are going to build what is
essentially the real Venice.''
</P>
<P>
   Val Thornton, of Bergman, Walls &AMP; Youngblood, the project
architect on the Paris, said in a recent interview: ``You don't
fool around with Paris. You do Paris, or you leave it alone.''
</P>
<P>
   A slight overstatement, considering that what is being built is
taking months rather than centuries, and is mostly decorative
effect rather than art. But what is real is the level of talent
that the casino owners are enlisting _ artists who have to contend
with modern necessities in the way that no master of the
Renaissance ever imagined: stringent fire regulations and code
restrictions, steel substructures, and mechanical and electrical
systems. And it must be remembered that Las Vegas, unlike ancient
Rome, puts up its buildings not for posterity but until the next
marketing gimmick.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the projects have been pretty fun, but there're
downsides to it as well,'' said Daniel Miller, a sculptor on
several Las Vegas projects who said he had invented a machine to
spray clay onto foam. ``Las Vegas in general is so hurried, you
have to compromise on your artistic vision. It's about the art of
compromise more than the art of sculpture.''
</P>
<P>
   Karen Kristin has been painting cloud-dappled skies in Las Vegas
since she first created the heavens in the Cleopatra suite of
Caesars Palace in 1988. ``I think they are like the new Catholics
in a way,'' she said, referring to the casino owners who, like the
popes of old in their zeal to top each other with each new
extravagance, are raising the caliber and budget of theming.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Mensching, the vice president of Evergreene Painting
Studios of New York, does not quite concur with the Las
Vegas-as-nouveau-Vatican analogy. ``Being Catholic, I'd have
trouble saying that,'' he said. But he agreed that ``the casinos
right now seem to be the major benefactors for studios like us.''
</P>
<P>
   In the new casinos, noble materials are used in just a few
places. The Bellagio, the Paris and the Venetian feature real
marble in prominent public areas, and not all the interior plants
are silk. The balconies and gates inside the Paris shopping mall
are wrought iron. But for the most part, Las Vegas is a magnet for
specialists in decorative effects, often using materials that are
light, cheap and synthetic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We take foam, plastic, fiberglass, cast stone or
glass-reinforced concrete and turn that into emotion,'' said Robert
Hlusak, the executive design manager at Treadway Industries of Las
Vegas, which made all the statuary, tracery and capitals of the
fake Doges' Palace and other landmarks at the Venetian casino
complex.
</P>
<P>
   Such ornamentation is hardly high art. ``It's the equivalent of
a set of showgirls molded in foam,'' said John Chase, author of the
forthcoming ``Glitter Stucco and Dumpster Diving,'' a collection of
essays on vernacular architecture. ``It's entertainment.''
</P>
<P>
   As Robert Venturi, the architect and an author of ``Learning
From Las Vegas,'' a 1972 celebration of the commercial Strip, put
it, ``Historians aren't going to come back and put fragments in a
high art museum, but they would put it in a craft museum.''
</P>
<P>
   The casino crafting does have its defenders. Terry Dougall, a
designer in Pasadena, Calif., whose Caesars Forum Shops mall is
widely credited with raising the quality of theming, said, ``People
may make fun of the faux marble in Las Vegas, but I can take you
through Renaissance palaces and show you miles of faux marble.''
</P>
<P>
   But what kind of art is it when even Robert Walker, a leading
faux-finisher, calls the Las Vegas crafts boom ``not really
creative''? With a few notable exceptions, like Dale Chihuly's
glorious glass sculpture, ``Fiori di Como,'' in the lobby of the
Bellagio _ which looks a bit like hundreds of multicolored sea
anemones clinging to the ceiling _ most of the artwork is imitative
rather than innovative.
</P>
<P>
   Evergreene has created versions of paintings by Tiepolo and
Veronese on the ceilings of the basilica-size hallways in the
Venetian. This is not school of velvet art, however, or paint by
numbers. The process is both complicated and alluring, involving
layouts designed mainly on computer, transferred to canvases and
then hand-painted in New York with acrylics. (Visually richer oil
paint cannot be used, because all materials have to be
fire-retardant.)
</P>
<P>
   Sky Art, on the other hand, paints ceilings with spray guns and
brushes. William Weidner, the president of Las Vegas Sands, which
owns the Venetian, described his fascination at watching Karen
Kristin, armed with walkie-talkie and laser pointer, shouting
instructions to artisans perched on high movable platforms: ``I
want wispy over there, lumpy over here. Deepen the sunset!''
</P>
<P>
   Such a concentration of artists, Weidner declared with the
ebullience typical of casino owners, just proves that these Las
Vegas resorts are ``the WPA's of the '90s and the next century _
only this time, they are WPA's created by the private sector.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   There has been so much work in Las Vegas that it has even lured
artisans like Erwin Antonitsch of European Design Iron. He left his
native Austria with a journeyman's certificate in wrought-iron
work, and eventually settled in Reno, Nev., where he forged the
balconies and gates for the Paris casino. Another artist setting up
shop in Las Vegas was Joan Morency of Color Alive, an ``aged wall''
specialist from Boston who made her local debut doing what she
called ``10 days of cloud work'' at Caesars Magical Empire in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Venturi argues that one does not have to be original to be an
artist. ``Michelangelo didn't invent new forms,'' he said. ``He
just did them better. What visitors see in Las Vegas now is
scenography that you walk through, a la Disneyland.'' It does
involve ``a kind of artistry using iconography that maybe did not
exist in the recent past,'' he added, ``but it is the art of
stagecraft.''
</P>
<P>
   It comes as no surprise then that many of the crafts specialists
now working in Las Vegas acquired their skills in Hollywood and
Disneyland. Dougall said he started working on the Caesars Forum
Shops in the early 1990s, ``at the time Hollywood was in slump _
scenic artists started knocking on our doors.''
</P>

   They have continued to come. But others arrive on the Strip
equipped with degrees in fine art and find themselves awe-struck
and energized, in spite of themselves. Marilyn Phillips, a
sculptor, had never used Styrofoam until she came to Las Vegas but
is now keen on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels great,'' Ms. Phillips said as she put the finishing
touches on a part-foam, part-clay column capital in the hangerlike
studio of Treadway Industries. ``It's so fast, it's wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   The Treadway design manager, Hlusak, said that finding the right
artist or artisan for the right job is not always easy. ``You can't
go to a university and say, `Give me your three best foam
sculptors,''' he said. ``What you find is your three best sculptors
in clay. There's a two-week-to-a-month learning curve, but if they
have an eye, they become trained in a new medium, and you are
training a new genre of artisans.''
</P>
<P>
   Budgets for theme decor have been expanding in the 1990s.
Weidner of Las Vegas Sands said that $100 million had been spent on
ornamentation at the Venetian. Charles Silverman, the president of
Yates-Silverman, a Las Vegas design company that did the interiors
of the public spaces at the Paris and all the interiors at New York
New York, said his company put in ``40,000 design hours on Paris,
and 25,000 on the entire New York New York, including guest
rooms.''
</P>
<P>
   But can this continue?
</P>
<P>
   Can Las Vegas, Our Lady of the Slot Machines, nurture a new
generation of crafts workers?
</P>
<P>
   Dougall, who said that the market for theming may be leveling
off, sees plenty of opportunities for top artisans in theme parks,
shopping malls and the casinos now being built around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Las Vegas' artisans have found work in private residences, too.
One firm, Projex, is custom-decorating a $5 million Roman-style
home in Miami. The owner called after seeing the firm's statuary in
Caesars Forum Shops. Moonlights Molds of Southern California, which
made bas-relief panels for Bellagio and Paris, is ornamenting a $30
million house in the Bel Air section of Los Angeles, (The company
also sells from a catalog of rosettes, capitals and moldings in
cast plaster, composites and fiberglass.)

   A Growing Backlog For Laptop Computers?
</P>
<P>
   If you are dreaming of a laptop computer under the tree this
holiday season, it may be time to wake up and go shopping. The
recent earthquake in Taiwan, where many PC systems are assembled,
coupled with bad timing in the manufacturing cycles for critical
computer components like liquid crystal displays, means that demand
for popular laptops is outrunning supply, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Laptop computers have been in short supply since spring, and
will continue to be in short supply until the middle of next
year,'' said Ross Young, president of Display Search, a flat-panel
display market research company in Austin, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Calls to several laptop manufacturers this week revealed an
average delay of several weeks between order and expected delivery.
Depending on the model and its popularity, some laptops are
available immediately, while others are backlogged a week or more.
In general, the larger and sharper the screen, the longer the
delay.
</P>
<P>
   Young said he tried to order a popular Dell laptop recently and
was told the backlog was seven weeks. He shopped around for several
days, he said, before finding a store that had an IBM Thinkpad in
stock.
</P>
<P>
   A salesman taking orders at Dell Wednesday said the company is
encouraging customers to choose the XGA screen option for its
flagship Inspiron 7500 laptop model because those screens are more
readily available than higher-resolution SXGA screens.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen M. Baker, director of hardware analysis at PC Data in
Reston, Va., said that prices are rising for memory chips and other
components, which could affect other PC systems. Baker said that PC
manufacturers probably would not raise prices to consumers for the
holidays but that they might offer less computer for the money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chances are they will reduce configurations instead,'' Baker
said. ``If they were planning on shipping a system with 128
megabytes of RAM, it may go out with 96 megabytes at the same
price.''

   IBM Offering Rainbow of Hues
</P>
<P>
   It has been a long time since IBM stopped requiring employees to
wear dark suits and white shirts, but it is still something of a
shock to see Big Blue producing computers in hues including Mars
Red Metallic, Terra Green Metallic, Eclipse Blue Metallic, Lunar
Gray Metallic, Sirius Red, Andromeda Green and Polaris Blue.
</P>
<P>
   But those are the actual color options for IBM's new Thinkpad
i-series 1400 portable computers, which were introduced this week.
The 1400-series portables come in a traditional IBM black case, but
they have snap-on covers in what IBM calls seven ``bright but
classy'' colors.
</P>
<P>
   The covers cost $29.95 each. One can imagine using the black
Thinkpad Monday through Thursday, and adding Mars Red or Polaris
Blue for dress-down Fridays.
</P>
<P>
   In another design innovation, the new Thinkpad 1460 and 1480
models ($2,199 to $2,399) also have an illuminated keyboard that
makes it easy to type in a dark meeting room or on an airplane at
night.

   A Hazard on the Road, A Hazard at the Pump
</P>
<P>
   By early next year, decals and signs declaring the potential
fire hazard of using a cell phone while pumping gas will be affixed
to gas pumps across the United States.
</P>
<P>
   BP Amoco was the first to issue the warnings, which instruct
people to turn off their cell phones while pumping. BP Amoco has
already placed the warnings on pumps throughout Britain and
Australia.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of this year, 16,000 BP Amoco service stations in the
United States will have similar warnings. Exxon and Chevron also
plan to put warning labels on their pumps.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter how remote the risk may be, we want to make
customers aware that they are putting themselves at some risk if
they are speaking on a cell phone, or operating a pager or any
other electronic device in the proximity of flammable liquids,''
said Howard Miller, a BP Amoco spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of these devices, all consumer devices, rely on batteries
as a source of electrical power,'' said Miller. ``And in many
cases, they hold enough energy to create a spark which could ignite
a flammable liquid like gasoline.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the Cellular Telecommunications Industry
Association, the trade association for the cellular industry, were
skeptical of the assertion. ``We have not found an incident
anywhere in the world that indicates that this has ever been a
problem,'' said Lisa Ihde, a spokeswoman for the association.
``We're not aware of any incident that would justify these
concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   What sparked the concern? Said Miller: ``It all started when a
story was widely circulated last May or June of some poor fellow in
Indonesia who was chatting on a cell phone and went up in flames.''
Miller said he had not seen confirmation of that incident.

   Getting on the Net Without a Computer
</P>
<P>
   Trying to get on the Internet without using a computer seems to
be the current Holy Grail. The latest device to join the parade is
the I-Opener from Netpliance.
</P>
<P>
   The I-Opener is a kind of portable Web TV. The unit does not
need to be attached to a television. It is portable so that it can
be easily moved to any room with power and a telephone jack. It has
a built-in 10-inch color LCD screen. And it comes with keyboard.
But it does not receive television signals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal was to make getting on the Internet as simple as
possible,'' said Kent Savage, president and chief executive of
Netpliance, based in Austin, Texas, during last week's Internet
World trade show in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The I-Opener has joined the trend of providing a colorful array
of choices to match your decor _ Black, Silver, Blue, Green and
Yellow.
</P>
<P>
   There are three pricing plans: $199 to purchase with a two-year
commitment for Internet service at $19.95 per month, $299 with a
one-year commitment and $399 with unlimited email and some free
services _ news headlines, sports, and weather _ a $19.95 per month
charge for full Internet access.

   Handspring Developing Programs for the Visor
</P>
<P>
   The Visor, Handspring's new competitor to the Palm Pilot, will
depend on independently developed programs and devices, everything
from MP3 players to exercise monitors, that will fit in the Visor's
expansion slot, called the Springboard.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the modules will not be available until early next year.
However, several should be available during the holiday buying
season.
</P>
<P>
   Concept Kitchen has developed a series of city guides, CitySync,
based on the Lonely Planet series of travel guides. Up to four city
guides can be loaded on to the expansion module, which has 8
megabytes of memory.
</P>
<P>
   The guide will have all the text of the printed guides, but will
also be a searchable database. You can quickly find specific
information such as a good Thai restaurant in the Times Square area
or an inexpensive hotel in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Peanut Press, a publisher that has an extensive list of books
from major publishers that have been formatted for hand-held
devices, has also bundled books for the Springboard, which can hold
up to 40 books on a single module.
</P>
<P>
   Customers can also buy their own 8 MB flash memory modules
($79.95) from Handspring and create a custom library by copying
downloaded Peanut Press books onto the unit. Each book is priced at
a discount from the printed version and cheaper than the discounted
prices at online bookstores. And no shipping and handling fee (just
a personal computer).

   Internet Users Step Into the World of van Gogh
</P>
<P>
   Have you ever been so entranced by a painting that you wished
you could enter its world of light, color, texture and artistic
imagination? The Intel Corp., the giant computer chip maker, is
inviting Internet users to do just that _ virtually, at least.
</P>
<P>
   The company's free art gallery Web site (www.artmuseum.net)
allows users to ``enter'' two of van Gogh's most famous canvases:
``The Yellow House'' and ``The Bedroom.''
</P>
<P>
   Using three-dimensional, computer-generated environments that
are based on the paintings, viewers can look under van Gogh's bed,
or study the paintings on his walls or even walk across the street
from the house on Place Lamartine in Arles and see it as the artist
may have seen it (and imagined it) as he walked home.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not just some technology stunt,'' said Ralph Bond,
Intel's consumer education manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``From an educational point of view, it is very compelling,
especially for younger people.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Gather 'round, children, as we tell you the tale of a
Brobdingnagian man who challenged society, laughed at society, and
may have even mastered society for 63 rollicking years.
</P>
<P>
   His name was Wilton Norman Chamberlain, and the very least we
can say about this man is that there has never been a basketball
player like him.
</P>
<P>
   Ready? An average of 50.4 points a game for an entire season.
One hundred points in a single game. Fifty-five rebounds in a
single game. And then there's my personal favorite Chamberlain
record _ an average of more than 48 minutes a game for an entire
season. Now we can start the argument as to who, if anyone, was
better, but surely we can have no disagreement concerning his
unique stature in the game of basketball. Wilt Chamberlain wasn't
merely in the record book. He was the record book.
</P>
<P>
   If you never saw him play, there's not much I can say other than
you owe it to yourself to seek out some video. You think Shaq is
strong? You think Shaq is unstoppable? Let's just put it this way:
If Wilt was a battleship, Shaq is a rowboat.
</P>
<P>
   Wilt was the kind of guy you, please pardon the exprsssion,
``held'' to 40, 45, or even 50 points. It's true. A basic strategy
was that you ``let'' Wilt get his 40, and you tried to hold the
others down. That sounds very odd to the modern ear, this notion of
conceding a man his 40, but those of us who lived through the
Chamberlain era got numbed early on to his astonishing might.
</P>
<P>
   Go back to those numbers two paragraphs up. In the 1961-62
season, he averaged slightly in excess of 50 points a game. Fifty.
Five-oh. Need I point out that nowadays, some teams are averaging
only 37 1/2 percent more than that? On March 2, 1962, he was 36 for
63 from the floor and 28 for 32 from the line while playing for the
Philly Warriors against the Knicks. That's 100 points! Let's see
how many NBA teams score 100 points on opening night. His numbers
read like some sort of basketball science fiction.
</P>
<P>
   But as amazing as they are, forget the numbers for a minute.
Wilt was not merely an accumulator of statistics. The truth is he
was one of the handful of greatest athletes this country has ever
produced. He could run. He could jump. He was at home in a track
meet. At one point, there was an offer on the table to box. He was
a skilled volleyball player.
</P>
<P>
   And he was unfailingly human, which was always held against him.
For one thing, he was too damn nice. At 7 feet 1 inch (at least)
and 280 pounds (at least), and superbly coordinated (beyond
dispute), he could have hurt people. But in Wilt's mind, that was
simply not an option. He was decent on the court, and he was decent
off it. He lacked a killer instinct. Worse yet, he often came to
play with an agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Oh no, it wasn't a political agenda or a social agenda. It was a
stylistic agenda. Wilt quickly grew bored with his nightly low-post
demonstration of power and finesse. He wanted people to know he was
not just another basketball goon, he could also bring grace and
elegance to the game. Hence his ever-growing infatuation with a
long fadeaway banker.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't a bad shot, either, but if you were Bill Russell, Nate
Thurmond, Johnny Kerr, or some other contemporary center of note,
would you prefer to see Wilt move menacingly toward the hoop or
take himself 20 feet from the basket with a banked fadeaway? Duh.
</P>
<P>
   Having mastered the physical landscape early in his career, Wilt
spent much of his final seven or eight years demonstrating to the
world he could do whatever he wanted to do. Except shoot free
throws, of course. But feed cutters? Hey, let's lead the league in
assists. How about allowing others to shine? Why, I'll just limit
myself to taps and dunks, and in so doing I'll lead the league in
field goal percentage.
</P>
<P>
   He managed to strike the perfect balance once. In 1966-67, he
averaged 24 points, 24 rebounds, and 8 assists per game. It's
certainly possible it was the most effective year any center has
ever had, before or since. Not surprisingly, his team won the
championship.
</P>
<P>
   It was one of just two championships he would win, and it was
forever held against him that while he was busy setting all the
records, his friend and rival Bill Russell was assembling an
impressive ring collection in Boston. It was, and always will be,
impossible not to take sides in the great Wilt vs. Russ debate
because this speaks to the heart of being a sports fan. Wilt
couldn't win. In the public eye, he was Goliath and Russell was
David, and we all know the outcome of that particular PR battle.
</P>
<P>
   So Wilt had to settle for something else. While Russell lost
money in various business ventures and did some minor damage to his
basketball reputation with an indifferent coaching stint in
Sacramento, Wilt lived happily and famously large for the last 26
years of his life. For Wilt was smart. He was good with money. He
hardly ever did anything he didn't want to do, and if you read his
notorious autobiography, you know one thing he really liked to do.
</P>
<P>
   He was known to be a loyal and generous friend, and he could
expound on any number of topics. He was a very happy man.
</P>
<P>
   But he often came off as a bitter guy because he found everyone
other than Russell inferior to him as a player. He was very hard on
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, for example, and just plain merciless when
evaluating lesser mortals (He once proclaimed that his dogs could
guard Marvin Webster, for example). But he would never regard
himself as bitter. He wuld regard himself as being truthful. And
the truth is not solely his dogs, but very possibly his cats and
perhaps even his goldfish could have guarded Webster. Wilt never
could see the sense in avoiding what he considered to be the truth.
</P>
<P>
   Here's more truth. We didn't merely lose a unique basketball
force when we lost Wilt Chamberlain. We lost a fascinating
American. When it came to getting the most out of his life, Wilt
never settled for the fadeaway. He took it to the hoop every chance
he got.

CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK: SIGHTS TRAINED YET AGAIN ON AMHERST'S ELUSIVE
BELLE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass.)   (bl)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Few American literary figures are as intensely loved as Emily
Dickinson (1830-1886). But few remain as elusive, which is the
reason waves of fresh interest in her life and work periodically
arise. One seems to be gathering strength now.
</P>
<P>
   A new edition of her complete poems has just been published for
the first time in nearly 40 years, throwing fresh light on her
working methods. A recent controversial selection of her
correspondence with her sister-in-law, Susan Huntington Dickinson,
suggests a potent erotic attraction between the two.
</P>
<P>
   And the poet came under further scrutiny last summer at a
meeting of the Emily Dickinson International Society at Mount
Holyoke College. Nearly 70 scholars presented research which
considered her work in the light of Daoism, Bengali poetry,
contemporary gay and lesbian studies and the domestic culture of
her time.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, this fall the Houghton Library of Harvard University
has put on view for the first time a substantial chunk of Dickinson
manuscripts in an exhibition titled ``Emily Dickinson: A Life in
Writing, 1830-1999'' (through Oct. 29). During the show, the public
also has access to a trove of personal effects usually kept under
lock and key: her tiny bedroom writing table and the chest of
drawers in which she stored her poems, once in the family home in
Amherst, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Dickinson was born in that house (which is now a museum) and
died there. She never married; she rarely traveled. Her days were,
on the surface, without incident. Yet, even in her lifetime,
legends began spinning around her.
</P>
<P>
   The writer Thomas Wentworth Higginson, to whom she had sent
poems, visited in 1870. He was mesmerized by ``the little plain
woman'' who entered the parlor ``with two daylilies which she put
in a sort of childlike way into my hand and said, `These are my
introduction' in a soft, frightened, breathless childlike voice.''
Dickinson was then 40.
</P>
<P>
   In 1881 a young Amherst College faculty wife named Mabel Loomis
Todd, new in town, became aware of ``a lady whom people call the
Myth. She has not been outside of her own house in 15 years. She
dresses wholly in white, and her mind is said to be perfectly
wonderful. She writes finely, but no one ever sees her.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor did anyone see the extent of her literary output until after
her death, when her sister, Lavinia, discovered more than 800 poems
in the chest. Written on letter paper, undated, untitled and
unsigned, they had been sewn into 40 pamphletlike volumes.
</P>
<P>
   Dickinson had instructed that her papers be destroyed, a common
stipulation in Victorian wills. Instead, Lavinia preserved the
booklets _ or fascicles, as they came to be called _ and engineered
the publication of a volume of poems in 1890. Intended as a modest
memorial, it was a huge popular hit.
</P>
<P>
   What, exactly, is Dickinson's appeal? In part it is her
fantastic language: the words with destabilized meanings, the
dissonant hymnbook cadences, the distinctive tone of voice:
defiant, witty, spiritually yearning but skeptical, emotionally
fervent but guarded.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is her personality, the primal, magnetic figure of
the American isolate. She knew her oddity and nurtured it. When
Higginson asked whether she didn't miss going out, seeing friends,
having a normal life, she answered, ``I never thought of conceiving
that I could ever have the slightest approach to such a want in all
future time.'' Then she added, ``I feel that I have not expressed
myself strongly enough.''
</P>
<P>
   She spurned publication (``The auction of the mind,'' she called
it). She turned being unknown into an elect state. She did without
the gratifications that most depend on. In exchange she was able to
give full attention to ideas _ death, divinity _ we barely know how
to think about. She lived a life  &UR; for  &LR;  us that we could never live
ourselves, which is what saints do. No wonder we hunger to know
her.
</P>
<P>
   We look for her in things she knew, like the personal effects at
Harvard. The writing desk, scarcely big enough to hold a lamp,
hints at her physical size. Books from her library _ Emily Bronte,
George Eliot, Shakespeare, the Bible _ reveal some literary
influences. A childhood portrait confirms a description she gave of
her hair as being ``bold, like the chestnut bur.''
</P>
<P>
   But her manuscripts, documenting the movement of her hand and
mind, prove surprisingly slippery. In past editions, her poems have
never been transcribed the same way twice. In fact, Dickinson has
always been to some extent a creation of her editors. This
problematic history is the subject of the Harvard show.
</P>
<P>
   Higginson and Todd prepared the posthumous 1890 book and labored
to make the poetry ``sensible.'' They added titles, normalized
spelling and punctuation and even rewrote poems. Later editors
reversed some of these decisions but made questionable new choices.
Martha Dickinson Bianchi, Lavinia's heir, brought out unpublished
poems in the 1920s and '30s. She left them untitled but, stumped by
the poet's handwriting, got words wrong.
</P>
<P>
   In 1955, Thomas H. Johnson issued his scholarly edition, dating
most of the poems and proposing a chronological order for the 40
fascicles. Although he had access to the Harvard material, the
other major group of manuscripts, now at Amherst College, was in
private hands. He was only able to see the group ``live'' on two
occasions.
</P>
<P>
   His monumental work has now been superseded in the variorum
edition by Ralph W. Franklin just issued by Harvard University
Press. Dates have been rethought and myriad textual details
reconsidered. But interpretations drawn from the results raise
still more questions.
</P>
<P>
   For example, while some scholars discern a conceptual logic in
the contents of the individual fascicles, Franklin concludes that
they are random compilations. Both views give potentially
important, though contradictory, readings of how Dickinson intended
her poems to be read.
</P>
<P>
   Editing can also shape a psychological profile, as in the case
of ``Open Me Carefully: Emily Dickinson's Intimate Letters to Susan
Huntington Dickinson,'' published by Paris Press in 1998. The
editors, Ellen Louise Hart and Martha Nell Smith, isolate the poems
and letters that Dickinson exchanged with her sister-in-law and in
them find evidence of both deep emotional ties and literary
collaboration.
</P>
<P>
   The notion of locating Dickinson in the manuscripts reverberated
at the Mount Holyoke conference. One historian proposed analyzing
the poet's changing handwriting to gauge her mental and physical
health and her emotional response to her correspondents.
</P>
<P>
   Another warned against turning the manuscripts into
all-answering fetish objects, diverting attention from other ways
of understanding Dickinson. Are the letters to Susan evidence of an
exceptional passion, or are they examplars of how women of a
certain class in a certain era communicated privately?
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to know. Dickinson filtered her life through her art,
which is one of indirection. ``The truth must dazzle gradually,''
she cautioned. So it does. That's why we endlessly recopy and
reread her words, why we revisit relics like those at Harvard, and
why, reversing the ordinary physics of fame, she seems to grow more
luminous the further she retreats in time.

ALAN FREED: THE MAN WHO KNEW IT WASN'T ONLY ROCK 'N' ROLL 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)

   HOLLYWOOD _ Ask anyone under 30 about Alan Freed, and the
response is probably a blank stare. After all, the legendary disc
jockey died in obscurity and poverty in 1965 after a tumultuous
career in which he introduced ``rock 'n' roll'' to the world and
broke racial barriers.
</P>
<P>
   With his triumphs he also dealt with crushing setbacks and
crises as the center of the great payola scandal of the late 1950s
and a target of J. Edgar Hoover and the FBI, partly because
rock-and-roll seemed so threatening. His world fell apart. He died
at 43 of uremic poisoning.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is, many young people today aren't aware of who he is
and what he had done,'' said Lindy DeKoven, executive vice
president for movies and mini-series at NBC. ``But the story of his
life _ what he did, the risks he took, the barriers he broke and
his downfall _ is remarkable.''
</P>
<P>
   The two-hour television drama, ``Mr. Rock 'n' Roll: The Alan
Freed Story,'' is to be broadcast on NBC on Sunday at 9 p.m. NBC
has found something of a niche with splashy musical dramas about
the '50s and '60s: in the last few years such shows as ``The
Temptations'' and ``The Sixties,'' have drawn large audiences,
including many teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   The new film, which stars Judd Nelson as the disc jockey, is an
adaptation by Matt Dorff of the 1991 book ``Big Beat Heat: Alan
Freed and the Early Years of Rock and Roll'' by John A. Jackson. It
was directed by Andy Wolk.
</P>
<P>
   The film includes appearances by '50s teen idols like Fabian and
Bobby Rydell (who play fathers outraged at the ``evils'' of
rock-and-roll) and abundant musical sequences that use the original
recordings of such performers as Little Richard, Jerry Lee Lewis,
Buddy Holly and the Crickets, the Moonglows, Jackie Wilson, Bo
Diddley, and Bill Haley and the Comets.
</P>
<P>
   ``This obsession with youth culture we see now is a direct
legacy of Alan Freed,'' said Dorff. ``He believed that teen-agers
needed a culture of their own, and he gave them the kind of music
that they could claim as theirs and theirs alone. He was also
colorblind _ he loved the beat, he loved the people who made the
music, and the fact that they were black made no difference to
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Freed _ whose real name was Aldon James Freed _ was a Cleveland
DJ playing mainstream music in 1951 when he eavesdropped on a group
of black and white teen-agers who were dancing to a new music that
made them want to ``jump.'' He played this new black music at
midnight nightly and it became a sensation. Freed soon went on the
air as Moondog at WJW in Cleveland. The next year, at the Moondog
Coronation Ball, considered the first rock concert, 20,000 fans
crashed the 10,000-seat capacity Cleveland Arena. The dance was
canceled.
</P>
<P>
   By 1954 Freed was hired by WINS in New York City, and his career
and fame took off even as he tangled with radio stations,
television networks and the music business over playing the
so-called black music.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was really the one that brought black rhythm-and-blues into
mainstream American society, and he made a lot of enemies because
of that,'' said Jackson, a retired elementary school teacher in
Farmingdale, N.Y., who has written other books on rock. ``Here was
this white guy bringing blacks and whites together to dance in the
1950s. It was unheard of.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was also very emotional, outspoken, and said and did what
he felt without considering the consequences,'' said Jackson. ``He
had enemies within the music business establishment, which was
pushed aside by rock. And the FBI had a file on him because of the
power he commanded and because he was so close to black
performers.''
</P>
<P>
   Near the peak of Freed's career, in 1957, ABC gave him a
nationally televised rock 'n' roll show that was canceled after
Frankie Lymon, the black performer, danced with a white girl on the
show and enraged Southern affiliates.
</P>
<P>
   Personal demons shadowed Freed. He was a workaholic, he was a
womanizer, he couldn't hold his marriages (three) together, he was
volatile. He began drinking heavily. ``He ultimately fell because
so many people wanted to see him fall,'' said Jackson. ``He helped
his enemies.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   What finally brought down Freed was payola, the practice in
which disc jockeys routinely received cash from song pluggers to
play a record. Jackson noted that, at the time, only New York and
Pennsylvania had laws against payola. The system, he said, was
legal in other states as long as the proceeds were reported to the
IRS.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of guys lied,'' said Jackson. ``He stood up and told
Congress that everyone took payola. He said that what's payola to
you is the same as lobbying to me. He told Congress that. He didn't
know when to sit down and be quiet.'' In 1962, Freed pleaded guilty
to two counts of commercial bribery and was fined $300. His career
was over, and his personal life slid under the weight of
alcoholism.
</P>
<P>
   Freed's career was marred by other practices as well. Like other
music industry insiders, he was accused of taking lucrative
songwriting credits for songs that were actually written by members
of the young groups he championed.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, who wrote the Freed biography, said that two members of
the virtuoso group the Moonglows told him that Freed had no
involvement with their big hit ``Sincerely'' yet took a writing
credit for it and received the royalties.
</P>
<P>
   He was listed for years as co-writer with Chuck Berry of another
giant early rock hit, ``Maybelline.'' Berry went to court
eventually and succeeded in having Freed's name removed as
co-writer.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said, however, that unlike other disc jockeys, Freed was
a trained musician who was capable of writing songs and may have
actually done so over the years.
</P>
<P>
   Another expert on vintage rhythm and blues, Ronnie Italiano, the
owner of Clifton Music, in Clifton, N.J., and an expert on the
music, said he had considerable ambivalence about Freed.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, he said, Freed's huge concerts with black
rhythm-and-blues acts led record companies to realize the
potentially huge teen-age audience for those performers. Members of
the great harmony group the Flamingoes told him that they owed
Freed a debt, even though he took credit for some songs that they
wrote. ``Their feeling was, if it wasn't for Freed, they never
would have become popular,'' said Italiano.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he said, others, like the later Bobby Lester of the
Moonglows, bitterly resented him. Italiano said Lester was
shoveling coal in Chicago to pay his rent while the song
``Sincerely'' was No. 1 on the hit parade.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson, the actor, said that after reading the Jackson book,
scouring Web sites and watching documentaries and videotapes about
Freed, he is convinced that what finally crushed Freed was not
payola but the racial breakthrough that the disc jockey almost
unintentionally led. ``He didn't see color, he saw music,'' said
Nelson.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other disc jockeys, Freed stuck with black singers and
groups whose songs were often ``covered'' by white acts. ``It was a
common occurrence in the '50s _ Little Richard had a song and then
Pat Boone would redo the song and the radio station would play the
white version,'' said Nelson. ``Alan Freed refused to do that. If
Chuck Berry made it first, he wouldn't play anyone else doing that
song. He made enemies because of it.''
</P>
<P>
   (Freed made additional enemies at the networks because he
refused to focus his shows on white acts playing before white
audiences as Dick Clark and other disc jockeys did.)
</P>
<P>
   At its inaugural ceremonies in 1986, he was inducted
posthumously into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, which through no
accident was built in Cleveland. &QL;

 &HT;    DISASTER AID TO REMOTE MEXICAN VILLAGES, PEOPLE CUT OFF BY
MUDSLIDES AND CONTINUED RAINFALL
 &HT;    EDs: For purposes of as locator map, Chiconcuautla is 15 miles
southeast of Huauchinango in Puebla state.
 &HT;    By SUSAN FERRISS 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICONCUAUTLA, Mexico _ After days of torrential rains, the
mountains that gave them life brought them death.
</P>
<P>
   Loosened by water and with no trees left to anchor it, a giant
slab of hillside caved in on a village near this isolated hamlet in
southeastern Mexico last week, burying at least 10 alive in an
avalanche of mud. The poor peasant farmers of Acalama _ casualties
of one of the most disastrous storms in Mexico in a decade _ had
deforested the hills here so they could
</P>
<P>
   plant corn.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday survivors huddled in this neighboring village,
accessible only by helicopter or at least a day's walk from the
nearest city, Huauchinango, Puebla, about 90 miles northeast of
Mexico City. Shivering in the cold, they waited for shipments of
food, candles, batteries and
</P>
<P>
   blankets and word of when their loved ones' bodies might be
pulled from the earth.
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband died trying to save his cousin,'' said a weeping
Maria Juana Campos, who rushed to meet a government helicopter that
landed here in Chiconcuautla. Pulling a dirty frayed red sweater
around her shoulders, Campos said five children were orphaned when
their parents died in the mudslide.
</P>
<P>
   Scores of tiny towns scattered in Puebla state's Sierra Madre
mountains remain cut off from civilization, stranded by swollen
rivers and mud-blocked gravel roads that snake around jagged peaks
here. After more than a week of storms in southeastern Mexico, at
least 329 are confirmed
</P>
<P>
   dead _ 237 in Puebla state _ and almost 300,000 are homeless
here and in the neighboring states of Veracruz, Tabasco and
Hidalgo.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the dead were victims of years of deforestation in these
rugged mountains. Others, including more than 100 people who died
Teziutlan _ a city in Puebla state _ died because their flimsy,
working-class homes were built on precarious urban hillsides.
</P>
<P>
   In Mixun, another village outside Huauchinango, at least 16
people perished, 12 of them children. The children and two teachers
were inside a schoolhouse last Wednesday when torrents of rain
cracked open the soft earth, swallowing the school and washing away
farmers' shacks.
</P>
<P>
   From a helicopter circling the region, Mexican Army troops were
seen picking through a mud-filled ravine that was once Mixun _ a
settlement of 19 wood-slat houses. The next largest town, where
survivors took shelter, is Pantepec, about 50 miles northeast of
Huauchinango and reached only by helicopter or a day's drive over a
battered road.
</P>
<P>
   ``People did not want to evacuate. The teachers said nothing
would happen. Then the earth sank,'' said a shell-shocked Juan Luis
Maria, whose 12-year-old daughter has not been found.
</P>
<P>
   ``The area is still very risky,'' said Army Lt. Col. Jose Ramon
Rojas, whose troops must scatter every time a helicopter passes
overhead. The land around Mixun is still very soft and walls of mud
begin to vibrate and threaten to cave in.
</P>
<P>
   Military helicopters and crafts belonging to Mexican Attorney
General's office are making regular flights to stranded villages
from Huauchinango and other sites throughout the state. From the
air, a bird's-eye view of the devastation reveals giant slabs of
mountainsides that have slid hundreds of feet into the Sierra
Madre's steep ravines. Most of the affected areas had been stripped
of the area's thick tropical vegetation and planted with corn and
other crops.
</P>
<P>
   Swollen waterfalls spill into canyons filled with mud and rocks.
Rivers have cut new paths, also dragging away farmland and homes.
Survivors huddle next to ravaged cornfields on peaks of mountains,
cooking over campfires and waving at helicopters, imploring them to
land and offer help.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main cause of these problems throughout the republic is
land erosion,'' said Jose Luis Flores, an assistant director of
emergencies for the Mexican government's Civil Protection Service.
He was flying over Puebla state's rain-soaked mountains, surveying
damage and emergency needs on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The government says it has reached most isolated townships by
now, but because roads are blocked, getting anything but basic food
supplies to people remains difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Alberto Amador Leal, who represents this area in Mexico's
Congress, also said the region has chronic problems with land
erosion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The traditional cultivation methods and crops grown here _
corn, chiles peppers and peanuts _ don't help us avoid erosion,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   University researchers, he said, have been trying to identify
vulnerable areas and have begun pilot programs to foster planting
of macadamia trees, blackberry shrubs and ornamental plants that
contribute less to erosion.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an economic and social problem,'' Amador Leal said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo has made daily trips
to hard-hit areas, his government has been under steady attack for
failing to act more quickly to help survivors. In Veracruz state
last week, he lost patience with a man interrupting his speech and
told him to ``shut up.'' When victims asked Zedillo to request
foreign aid, including American helicopters, he said ``No, we
Mexicans can do it alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo later apologized to the man he scolded. And on Tuesday,
he softened his stance on foreign aid, inviting other countries to
contribute to the Mexican Red Cross. Mexico's Senate also issued a
statement inviting foreign aid.

BRITISH ARTISTS HAVE BEEN TAKING RISKS, AND FLAK, FOR YEARS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By SARAH LYALL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ It all began in 1988 when Damien Hirst, an art student
full of swagger and energy, decided to put on a show.
</P>
<P>
   He took works by unknown artists, himself and 15 other students
from Goldsmiths College here, and displayed them in a spectacular
abandoned Docklands warehouse. Calling the show ``Freeze,'' he
printed glossy catalogs, alerted the artistic in-crowd and turned
the whole thing into such an event that by the time the advertising
mogul and art arbiter Charles Saatchi showed up, Hirst was proud to
inform him that all the art was already spoken for.
</P>
<P>
   And so it was that a new group, the Young British Artists, was
born. They were Neo-Conceptualists who, more often than not, set
out to shock, using video, photography, painting, collage and
sculpture to tweak convention and raise questions about big-ticket
subjects like life, death, sex and the ennui of existence. These
artists emerged as a potent force in London in the early 1990s, and
their work forms the core of the ``Sensation'' exhibition now
generating so much light and heat at the Brooklyn Museum of Art.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're using the language of contemporary art to actually
face, straight on, questions about people's daily lives and
existence in a way that is very special and particularly English,''
said Norman Rosenthal, exhibitions secretary of the Royal Academy
of Arts here, where ``Sensation'' drew protests, raves and some
350,000 visitors in 1997. ``Though myth is a large part of their
art, they are not mythologizing the subject matter they're dealing
with. They're going straight for the jugular.''
</P>
<P>
   The artists have been going straight for the jugular, in
different ways, for the last 11 years, and though they are not as
young as they used to be _ most are now well into their 30s _ the
Young British Artists have managed to convey the sense, all this
time, that their work is still fresh and innovative. While they
have made the transition from anonymity and relative poverty to
artistic celebrity, their next big challenge is the one that
bedevils every artist known for startling work: what to do for an
encore.
</P>
<P>
   Although their work varies widely, the artists have a few things
in common. In class-obsessed Britain, they generally came from the
lower end of the spectrum _ maybe not working class but certainly
lower-middle class _ and were willing to circumvent the art
establishment to get ahead. They hung out together, smoked and
drank together, fell in and out of love with one another and
championed one another's work. And most studied at Goldsmiths, a
well-known art school where the lines between different artistic
mediums were blurred and where the Conceptual artist Michael
Craig-Martin, a professor of fine art, was fast developing a
reputation for being a first-class nurturer of young talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the history of this is written, it will be Michael
Craig-Martin who is seen as the godfather,'' said Richard Dorment,
the art critic at The Daily Telegraph. ``What he did was encourage
these young artists to define art not in terms of painting and
sculpture but conceptually, in that it could be made of anything.''
</P>
<P>
   At Goldsmiths students also learned valuable lessons about
subjects other than making art: how to navigate the complicated art
market, how to publicize their work, how to get attention.
</P>
<P>
   It was no coincidence that the group emerged in the tail end of
the Thatcher years, a time when the government was particularly
uninterested in supporting the arts.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no longer a public support system,'' Dorment said.
``Young people were told not to accept handouts from the Arts
Council but to help themselves. And there was a change in attitude.
Young artists saw the rest of the country kicking to life in a
capitalist way, so they decided to put on their own shows and
exhibitions, rather than waiting for galleries.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The indisputable leader of the pack was Hirst, then just in his
early 20s and bursting with youthful creativity and market savvy
beyond his years. His ability to produce provocative art _ his most
famous, now on display in Brooklyn, is probably the sleek, 14-foot
tiger shark floating in formaldehyde _ was more than matched by his
skills as an impresario, curator and promoter. And he had an
uncanny knack for generating publicity, securing his position as
the enfant terrible of British art by cavorting drunkenly with pop
stars, making outrageous comments to the news media, and cheerfully
posing for strange, high-concept photographs in magazines.
</P>
<P>
   Where Hirst went, his friends followed.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The group expanded as the years went on, but the core was drawn
from the 16 original ``Freeze'' artists, nine of whom appear in
``Sensation.'' In addition to Hirst, the Young British Artists, who
also became known as the Freeze Generation, include Rachel
Whiteread, Ian Davenport, Gary Hume, Fiona Rae, Sarah Lucas, Gavin
Turk, Chris Ofili and Abigail Lane, among others.
</P>
<P>
   Their work has ranged from Hirst's huge installations
(butterflies hatching, maggots attacking a rotting cow's head,
medicine cabinets full of scary-looking pills and equipment) to Ms.
Whiteread's stark plaster casts of interior spaces to ``Self,'' by
Marc Quinn, a frozen cast of his own head made with eight pints of
his blood.

</P>
<P>
   The artists have tended to mix their mediums. Gillian Wearing
gave strangers on the street pens and paper and asked them to write
whatever was on their mind, then photographed them standing next to
signs that said, for instance, ``I'm desperate.'' In ``16 mm.,''
Sam Taylor-Wood made a film of a young woman dancing _ or being
made to dance _ to the sounds of machine-gun fire.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   As the decade progressed, the work _ much of it so large and
unwieldy as to rule out being displayed in, say, the space above a
sofa _ put art in the center of Britain's youth-driven cultural
boom.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very accessible art,'' said Cornelia Grassi, who owns
Greengrassi, a contemporary art gallery in London. ``You don't have
to do an art history class. You can look at the title and the piece
and understand what they're doing and summarize it in one sentence.
Not that it's simplistic, but it's not going to alienate a general
public.''
</P>
<P>
   It did alienate a lot of people, though. The debate over what it
meant and whether it was really art and why so much of it seemed
deliberately distasteful spread far beyond the artistically minded
crowd.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The tabloid press delighted in stunts like sending a reporter to
pose near a Hirst dead-fish piece with an order of french fries,
for a fish 'n chips photograph. And some critics said they really
could not see the point.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just to wish to excite horror and shock by showing somebody a
cadaver isn't necessarily a particularly interesting esthetic
act,'' the art critic Robert Hughes told The New York Times in
1995, speaking of Hirst. ``His works of art are meant to create a
sort of environment for themselves, which is nothing other than
sensational. I think the content of actual thought in Damien
Hirst's work is pretty close to zero.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   With little money on hand and expensive pieces to make, the
artists were supported by a large network, including new
contemporary art galleries like the White Cube in Piccadilly and
more established institutions like the Tate Gallery, which sponsors
the the Turner Prize _ a prize that has been won by Hirst, Ms.
Whiteread, Ms. Wearing and Ofili. There were also individual
patrons, of whom the most influential and the most pervasive was
Saatchi, the advertising executive turned art collector.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   He still spends much of his time traveling to artists' studios
and exhibitions of contemporary art, gathering pieces for his
collection. Some then go on display at the Saatchi Gallery, a
gleaming white temple to contemporary art in northwest London.
Saatchi became the patron nonpareil of the movement _ ``Sensation''
is drawn from his holdings _ and a tastemaker whose support, or
lack of it, can determine the trajectory of an artist's career.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``He's more than just a collector,'' Rosenthal said. ``He's the
great patron of a lot of these artists and has actually enabled
them to work.''
</P>
<P>
   The Young British Artists were welcomed, too, in the frisky
European contemporary art world, giving London an international
reputation for being a place where things were happening again.
Work by the best-known artists began to fetch higher and higher
prices and to appear in galleries and museums in the United States.
In 1995 the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis put on ``
`Brilliant!': New Art From London.''
</P>
<P>
   All this leaves old hands here slightly bemused that
``Sensation'' has stirred up such a fuss in New York. For one
thing, many of the pieces in the exhibition come from the early
'90s, making them yesterday's news by contemporary art standards.
Also, London already had its ``Sensation'' convulsion, when the
show opened at the Royal Academy two years ago; most of the
complaints then, however, centered on the inclusion of Marcus
Harvey's picture of Myra Hindley, one of Britain's most notorious
mass murderers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing that two years later it goes to New York and
creates this big furor,'' said Craig-Martin of Goldsmiths. ``It
seems completely bizarre from a British point of view that in
America, the land of sin, there should be a fuss about a couple of
pictures. It's as though nobody had ever seen risque things and sex
and violence before.''

   Windy and cooler weather will invade the Northeastern states
Thursday as strengthening low pressure quickly moves toward the
Canadian Maritime provinces. The day will begin with clouds near
the Northeast coast, which will rapidly yield to increasing
sunshine. Wind gusts of more than 30 miles per hour will be common,
especially in New England. Most of the region will have plenty of
afternoon sunshine, however, a few showers will linger in the
mountains of northern New England.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Southeast will be sunny and seasonably mild.
Tropical moisture from a large area of disturbed weather over the
Caribbean will stream toward southern Florida bringing clouds and
locally heavy showers.
</P>
<P>
   Tropical Storm Irene which formed in the western Caribbean near
Grand Cayman Island on Wednesday is expected to strengthen as it
drifts north. The storm will threaten western Cuba and southern
Florida over the next few days.
</P>
<P>
   A frontal system with limited moisture will move quickly across
the northern Plains toward the Great Lakes. Clouds and a few
showers will precede the front, especially near the northern Great
Lakes. Behind the front, breezy and cooler weather will spread into
the northern Rockies and Plains later Thursday and Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Sunny and warm conditions will cover a large area from the
southern and central Plains to the Southwestern states. Meanwhile,
the Northwest will turn cooler, with a few showers along the
west-facing mountain slopes of the Bitterroots.

   The observation from College Station, Texas, reported a
nine-minute snow shower Tuesday despite temperatures in the 80s.
The obviously erroneous report was just one of countless bits of
the weather data that are transmitted around the world each day.
Sometimes, mistaken reports are not filtered from the matrix of
information that is used as the database for complex computer
weather prediction models. Some of the errors present at the
starting point of a computer weather forecast can grow in time
resulting in large errors when the prediction reaches many hours or
days in the future.  &QL;

PRINE MAKES US LAUGH `IN SPITE OF OURSELVES' 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By PETER COOPER    
 The Spartanburg (S.C.) Herald-Journal    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   John Prine, ``In Spite of Ourselves,'' Oh Boy Records
</P>
<P>
   John Prine songs aren't the regular kind. They seem birthed not
from a Nashville home but from some other, quirkier place. ``You
come home late and you come home early/ You come on big when you're
feeling small/ You come home straight and you come home curly/
Sometimes you don't come home at all,'' he sang in ``Speed of the
Sound of Loneliness.''
</P>
<P>
   But, as with the finest work of Roger Miller, Prine's humor is
often merely a song's outer layer. Peel the onion and you end up
with a poignant study of a relationship's aftermath (``All the
Best''), or with an affecting vision of a convict's loneliness
(``Christmas in Prison'').
</P>
<P>
   That's a hard trick to perform in a commercial music world where
a line is drawn in the sand between novelty tunes and ``real''
songs. These days, it's either the yucksterism of Weird Al Yankevic
or the cringe-worthy earnestness of Celine Dion.
</P>
<P>
   And that's too bad. Throughout its recorded history, popular
music has woven humor into its mainstream tapestry.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Berry's ``School Days,'' Hank Williams' ``Why Don't You
Love Me Like You Used to Do,'' Phil Ochs' ``Here's to the State of
Mississippi'' and The Byrds' ``So You Wanna Be a Rock 'n' Roll
Star'' are a few of the many songs that sought to make serious
points through amusing lyrical structures.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, John Prine's music may exist in a vacuum, but it
was not born in one.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Spite ofves,'' Prine's just released disc of duets
with his favorite female vocalists, makes this point in spades.
Prine offers takes on such tongue-in-cheek country masterworks as
``(We're Not) The Jet Set,'' which was originally recorded by
George Jones and Tammy Wynette.
</P>
<P>
   Prine also offers an interpretation of Hank Williams' ``Dear
John (I Sent Your Saddle Home),'' and he and Iris DeMent had the
nerve to revive Jones' duet with Melba Montgomery on ``Let's Invite
Them Over,'' the only country hit to tackle a particular type of
swinging:
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not in love with each other/ We're in love with our best
friends/ So let's invite them over again.''
</P>
<P>
   The album's most intriguing song is the title track, Prine's
only songwriting contribution, which melds Prine's scratchy,
drawling vocals with DeMent's quivering, beautifully anachronistic
voice.
</P>
<P>
   Listening to the song, a husband and wife's evaluations of the
other partner's eccentricities, is like staying too late at a party
and hearing a drunken old couple tell stories on each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``She thinks all my jokes are corny/ Convict movies make her
horny,'' Prine sings. DeMent's retorts, several of them unprintable
in this newspaper, are a mixture of sarcasm, befuddlement and
abiding love as she stands by her fallible man with a touching lack
of judgment.
</P>
<P>
   DeMent, who appears on four songs, is one of nine singing
partners on the album. The others are the legendary and still
wondrous Connie Smith, blues-inflected alternative country singer
Lucinda Williams, hitmakers Patty Loveless and Trisha Yearwood,
angel-voiced Emmylou Harris, Irish alto Delores Keane, Prine's wife
Fiona, and Jones' former duet partner, Melba Montgomery.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, things work out just fine. Loveless sings
wonderfully on ``Back Street Affair,'' and the acres of echo that
sometimes accompany her more polished studio recordings are excised
here in favor of crisp production from Prine and Jim Rooney.
</P>
<P>
   Harris is great on ``I Know One,'' Smith once again makes a case
for herself as one of the top vocalists in country history on ``So
Sad''(To Watch Good Love Go Bad), and the years since her 1960s
duets with Jones have torn none of the spunk from Montgomery's
voice.
</P>
<P>
   On the downside, Keane fits well on ``It's a Cheating
Situation'' but turns in a curious misreading of Kieran Kane's ``In
a Town This Size.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout, Prine sounds rougher and more weathered than before
his recent, successful bout with neck cancer. At times he opts for
singing the melody an octave below his female counterpart rather
than taking a more pleasing harmony line.
</P>
<P>
   But those are small quibbles. Prine has a sly, endearing smile
in his voice that works as well when he sings others' songs as when
he performs his own material. He's not Enrico Caruso, but then
``Milwaukee Here I Come'' is not ``O Sole Mio.''
</P>
<P>
   Heck, I'll take a Prine concert over grand opera any day, and
I'll take ``In Spite of Ourselves'' over most CDs I've heard this
year. As usual, Prine has delivered something special.

A NEW EMBASSY DESIGN REFLECTS A CAUTIOUS WORLD VIEW  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Canada, Cyprus, Jordan, Kuwait, Oman, Thailand, Colombia,
Chile, Venezuela, Peru, Bolivia, Kenya, Tanzania, Germany and El
Salvador.)  By JAMES BROOKE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   OTTAWA _ One side of the new American Embassy here engages the
town. A wall of warm limestone, generously perforated with windows,
stands across the street from old stone warehouses converted into a
market of upscale shops selling a, books and designer
fashions.
</P>
<P>
   The embassy's other, ceremonial side engages the crown. Sheathed
in tempered glass, it provides a smooth transition from the glass
house that is the National Art Gallery of Canada to the copper
turrets and neo-Gothic gargoyles of Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   What is remarkable about this low-profile, steamship-shaped
embassy, inaugurated here last week by President Clinton, is that
it stands in the heart of a city. In a depressing era of truck
bombs and embassies hiding behind high walls in suburban compounds,
the glassy new mission building makes a powerful statement for an
endangered species: the urban American Embassy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being downtown is a wonderful gesture of American openness,''
David M. Childs, the lead architect, said of the embassy, which
cost $40 million to build and opens for business within the next
few weeks. An advocate of cities, Childs, of Skidmore, Owings &AMP;
Merrill, is leading the redesigns of Columbus Circle and
Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   For 20 years, the fate of the embassy, like blueprints for
American embassies the world over, was pushed and pulled by issues
of security. As the United States enters the 21st century as the
only superpower, embassy design has moved from the monumental to
the hunkered down. The design seems to reflect a cautious,
defensive world view that sees the mission of American diplomats as
one of managing resentment.
</P>
<P>
   No one seriously questioned the need for a new American Embassy
in Canada, the largest trading partner of the United States. Sixty
people now work crowded in the old embassy, a neo-Renaissance
structure built in 1932 for a staff of 12. About another 200
American and Canadian employees are scattered around Ottawa,
occupying space under 12 separate commercial leases. The new
embassy will concentrate all the employees under one roof.
</P>
<P>
   Canada had reserved for the United States the last vacant lot on
Parliament Hill, a lot prominent on Sussex Drive, the ceremonial
parade route between Parliament and the prime minister's residence.
In symbolic symmetry, the United States set aside for Canada the
last open lot on Washington's ceremonial thoroughfare, Pennsylvania
Avenue. A decade ago, when Canadian diplomats settled into their
privileged position, the ambassador moved into an office with a
rare and magnificent bay-window view of the United States Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   American diplomats fully intended to occupy a similar position
of honor. The design that emerged and endured is low key _ actually
lower than surrounding buildings and smaller than the Canadian
Embassy in Washington. On Pennsylvania Avenue, the Canadian
Embassy's sharp stone angles, giant aluminum columns and monumental
courtyard speak of a small nation clamoring for attention. In
Ottawa, the reserved U.S. Embassy building, with its modest central
tower, speaks of a nation that knows it accounts for 85 percent of
Canada's foreign trade. The building embodies the calculated
restraint of a dominant nation that sees no gain in throwing its
architectural weight around.
</P>
<P>
   The sober building's one external folie, Joel Shapiro's bronze
building-block sculpture dedicated by Hillary Rodham Clinton, was
greeted two weeks ago by The Ottawa Sun newspaper as ``glaringly
and gratingly American.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1983, early in the design saga here, the first truck bomb
reverberated through American diplomacy with an explosion at the
U.S. Embassy in Beirut, Lebanon, that killed 63. In 1985, a
commission headed by Bobby Ray Inman, the retired admiral and
former deputy director of the Central Intelligence Agency,
stipulated that new embassies should be set back 100 feet from
public streets and that windows were to be limited to 15 percent of
exterior wall space.
</P>
<P>
   Under these guidelines, the State Department ruled in 1988 that
the downtown site in Ottawa was unsafe. But for the next five
years, there was a lull in major bomb attacks worldwide. In January
1993, after envoys rejected suburban sites, the State Department
decided to waive security standards for Ottawa, allowing 30-foot
setbacks. Ottawa, like New York, was deemed a low security threat.
</P>
<P>
   The next month, a van exploded under the World Trade Center,
killing 6 people and wounding 1,000. That year, the first of the
bunker embassies opened, in Nicosia, Cyprus. Others followed, often
on suburban sites in third world countries: Jordan, Kuwait, Oman,
Thailand, Colombia, Chile, Venezuela, Peru, Bolivia and El
Salvador.
</P>
<P>
   Childs labored quietly against the grain, trying to design an
urban embassy for Ottawa that would not look like the outward
manifestation of a paranoid nation. On April 19, 1995, he briefed
Ottawa's National Capital Commission, which oversaw the
construction of the embassy. A few hours later, he received the
news of the devastating bombing of the Federal Building in Oklahoma
City.
</P>
<P>
   Going back to the design boards, he moved an external corridor
system into the building's core, creating an atrium that now runs
the length of the building, injecting light and a sense of
community into the four floors of offices. In 1997, workers broke
ground on the building. In 1998, truck bombs destroyed two American
embassies in East Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be in the city and not be a fortress _ that is the real
problem,'' Childs said, talking of the security constraints that
hung over his work.
</P>
<P>
   He has labored to create the illusion of American accessibility
and participation in the urban setting. When the diplomats move in
and the lights go on, passers-by on either side of the building
will be able to see Americans working at their desks, or trotting
up and down glass-enclosed stairwells in the prow and stern of the
boat-shaped building. What they may not know is that that the glass
is three inches thick, bulletproof and bomb resistant.
</P>
<P>
   People strolling past the monumental buildings in Major's Hill
Park, near Parliament, may marvel at the sparkling glass face that
the embassy presents to MacKenzie Avenue, part of the capital
parade route. What they may not know is that this tinted glass
``wall'' has the effect of a 21st century trompe l'oeil _ just
behind it is a concrete wall reinforced with steel and punctuated
with small windows that meet security guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to embassy receptions or passport offices will find
that a security guard is there to push open the doors, leaden
affairs that would fill the bill in a maximum-security prison. Few
visitors will know that the structure is designed to prevent
collapse from horizontal stresses after an earthquake or bomb
blast.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no security concerns whatsoever,'' Gordon D. Giffin,
the U.S. ambassador here, announced at a news conference last week.
``In Ottawa, it was critical to be part of the vibrant activity
downtown.'' But walking through the building with members of the
press, he refused to allow photographs of the maple wood walls,
citing State Department security rules.
</P>
<P>
   (MORE) nn
</P>
<P>
   The opening of this downtown embassy, long advocated by Sen.
Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., bolsters a school of thought that
says that in some capitals, the combination of risk levels,
prestige and working convenience comes out in favor of the United
States' flying the flag downtown. Although Serbian demonstrators
threw paint bombs at the American Consulate in Toronto last spring,
there is no history of embassy bombings in Ottawa, a well-ordered
city of 1 million people. A month after the end of the Kosovo
bombing, 4,000 Canadians and Americans flocked to a huge Fourth of
July picnic here organized by the American ambassador.
</P>
<P>
   In Singapore, a low-terrorism city-state where real estate
prices are at a premium, the State Department has reduced the
setback guidelines for the newly opened American Embassy from 100
feet to 50 feet.
</P>
<P>
   The situation is trickier in Berlin, where work has stalled on a
new $120 million embassy. Americans and Germans want the United
States to build it near the Reichstag on the prewar embassy site,
at the end of Unter den Linden, with a view of the Brandenburg
Gate. Local zoning laws, drawn up to restore the historical
elegance to the boulevard, require that buildings go close to
sidewalks and have an ample amount of windows on the street.
</P>
<P>
   ``The basic problem is the security standards, which require the
embassies to have a 100-foot setback behind a wall,'' said John
Ruble, the principal design architect, whose firm, Moore Ruble
Yudell, is working on the Berlin Embassy in conjunction with Gruen
Associates. ``Of course, in a historic town center that is not that
easy to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Planners have discussed burying streets or moving them into a
park, steps that would violate the historic esthetics of this grand
area. Ruble said of the impasse, ``Imagine trying to move Fifth
Avenue into Central Park to create a setback for a building.''
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1990s, advocates of a downtown embassy in Berlin were
prevailing. For the work of diplomats, it would be hard to beat the
prestige and efficiency of an embassy located a five-minute walk
from Germany's Parliament and major government buildings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were ready to go in the fall of last year, but in August
those bombings happened, and the whole thing was put on hold,''
Ruble said, recalling the destruction of the American embassies in
Kenya and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   In Ottawa, while American diplomats may feel secure in their new
steel and glass cocoon, their new neighbors are debating their
security. In the African bombings, most of the injuries were to
passers-by and neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Two hundred yards to the north stands the National Gallery, an
art greenhouse composed of 5,307 panes of glass. Gallery officials
have decided to forgo covering the windows with a costly coating
that would minimize splintering.
</P>
<P>
   Sgt. Douglas Kirkland of the Ottawa-Carleton Police Department
thinks that that may be an unwise decision. With a coating, he
said, ``you are not going to have a million shards of glass from
each ones of these panes of glass being driven through people.''
</P>
<P>
   On the east side, merchants in the old stone warehouses of
Byward Market are torn between nervousness over security risks and
the welcome arrival of some 300 embassy employees, their wallets
filled with strong green dollars. For the moment, no one is
investing in coatings on their shop windows. But with the streets
fronting the embassy turned into no-standing zones, shop owners
plan to attend a seminar by Kirkland next month on identifying and
reporting suspicious vehicles.

COURT QUESTIONS FEDERAL AGE-BIAS SUITS AGAINST STATE EMPLOYERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court appeared ready Wednesday to deny
state workers who believe they are victims of age discrimination
the right to sue their employers under a federal anti-bias law.
</P>
<P>
   In three cases from Alabama and Florida, the high court, which
in recent years has voted repeatedly to limit Congress' power over
states, heard arguments on whether the state employers have
immunity under the 11th Amendment against the Age Discrimination in
Employment Act (ADEA) of 1967.
</P>
<P>
   The amendment, among other things, bars residents of a state
from suing that state in a federal court.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in the three
cases that states and state agencies have 11th Amendment immunity
from lawsuits under ADEA. Relying on a 1996 Supreme Court decision,
the appeals court said a federal law can override state immunity
only when Congress specifically says that immunity doesn't apply
and when Congress is attempting to stop an unconstitutional
discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the arguments, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor noted:
``This statute does not mention the 11th Amendment.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice Anthony M. Kennedy added that in considering the 1967
law Congress never addressed the issue of states' immunity.
``Congress did not have the debate we are having here,'' he said
``It didn't come close to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the last eight years, O'Connor and Kennedy have cast key
swing votes in a number of states' rights cases that have curtailed
the power of Congress. In two of those cases, those justices,
joined by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Antonin
Scalia and Clarence Thomas, rejected the idea that Congress can
give the federal government authority over states on issues such as
gun-free school zones and gambling on Indian reservations.
</P>
<P>
   Representing groups of state employees in Florida and Alabama,
Jeremiah A. Collins, a Washington, D.C. attorney, told the court
that Congress did intend to extend the age discrimination law to
the states. ``Congress unequivocally authorized these lawsuits,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Scalia asked whether Congress had the right to ban
discrimination of older workers, who are not protected under the
Constitution. ``Congress just went out on its own and defined a
prejudice that no court had previously pointed out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rehnquist quickly asked rhetorically: ``Can Congress deal with a
supposed problem by creating a new constitutional law?''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration lawyer Barbara Underwood also urged the
justices to overturn the appeals court ruling and allow state
employers to be sued under the federal law.
</P>
<P>
   But when O'Connor asked why the state employees ``couldn't just
sue their employer in state court since both Florida and Alabama
have their own anti-discrimination laws,'' Underwood acknowledged
that the employees did have that option.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Sutton, a Columbus, Ohio, lawyer representing the state
employers, agreed with O'Connor, arguing that ``instead of
permitting age discrimination, states have overprotected this
group, and there is no need for the federal government's help.''
</P>
<P>
   All 50 states have age discrimination laws.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the three cases involved university faculty members and
librarians. In one case, 36 current and former faculty members and
librarians at Florida State University and Florida International
University sued the Florida Board of Regents in federal court,
contending that age bias was the reason they lost out on certain
salary increases given to younger faculty members.
</P>
<P>
   The claims stemmed from a 1991 collective bargaining agreement
that required the state to give annual raises to state university
faculty members. The size of the faculty members' raises was based
on how long they had been with the university.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1993, FSU and FIU refused to give an annual raise to
their faculties, citing a lack of funds. In suing the two
universities, the 36 plaintiffs said that because their raises
would have been larger than those of younger members, the loss of
income would have ``a disproportionate impact'' on them.
</P>
<P>
   In the other Florida case, a Panama City prison guard named
Wellington Dickson sued the state Department of Corrections, saying
he had lost a promotion partly because of age discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   In the Alabama case, two associate professors at the state-run
University of Montevallo in Montevallo, Ala., alleged that they had
been denied promotions to full professor, appointments to committee
assignments, higher salaries and sabbatical leaves because of their
age. They also argued that the university maintained a salary and
evaluation system that worked against older faculty members.
</P>
<P>
   Among those who submitting friend-of-the-court briefs supporting
federal court access for such claims are the American Association
of Retired Persons, the American Association of University
Professors and the American Federation of State, County and
Municipal Employees.
</P>
<P>
   Among those urging the justices to rule out such federal court
access are 23 states _ Connecticut, Delaware, Georgia, Hawaii,
Idaho, Kansas, Louisiana, Maine, Michigan, Mississippi, Montana,
Nebraska, Nevada, New Jersey, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania,
Rhode Island, Tennessee, Utah, Vermont and Virginia.

NISSAN USED TO BE DATSUN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGERS CADENHEAD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q:.MDNM/ When and why did Datsun change its name to Nissan? _
T.E., Euless, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A:.MDNM/ In 1982, the Nissan Motor Corp. dropped the Datsun name
used in the United States on small pickups, sports cars and sedans
in favor of Nissan, which was being used in other countries.
</P>
<P>
   Datsun, a name formed from the initials of company founders, was
used in Japan until the '30s. The change to Nissan was not
well-received by U.S. dealers, costing millions in sign replacement
and lowering the company's name recognition as much as 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took five years for Nissan to get the same level of name
recognition as Datsun,'' Nissan marketing executive Tom Orbe told
``Ward's Auto World'' in 1996. ``From the consumer's point of view,
Datsun went away and Nissan was a new company.''
</P>
<P>
   Q:.MDNM/ Several years ago, President Zachary Taylor's body was
exhumed because of an author who believed he might have been
murdered. Was the book about this ever written? _ K.B., Ashby,
Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A:.MDNM/ No Taylor book appears to have been written by Clara
Rising, the novelist and historian whose research prompted Taylor's
1991 exhumation to look for signs of arsenic poisoning.
</P>
<P>
   After receiving permission from some of Taylor's descendants,
Rising sent her research to the coroner of Jefferson County, Ky.,
who approved the exhumation. A medical examiner concluded that
Taylor died of natural causes.
</P>
<P>
   Rising, author of the Civil War novel ``In the Season of the
Wild Rose,'' was doing research on Taylor for a planned book.
Taylor, the 12th president, died on July 9, 1850, after eating iced
cherries and milk during a holiday celebration. Doctors at the time
attributed his death to gastroenteritis.
</P>
<P>
   Q:.MDNM/ Who is the lady with the big glasses in the Old Navy
commercials? _ A.S., Fort Worth
</P>
<P>
   A:.MDNM/ She's Carrie Donovan, 71, a former fashion writer for
``The New York Times Magazine,'' ``Vogue'' and ``Harper's Bazaar''
who has been wearing those oversize glasses since the '60s.
</P>
<P>
   Donovan, who retired from the magazine in 1994, was doing print
ads for Old Navy in 1997 when she joked that she would be ``awfully
good on TV,'' according to ``Entertainment Weekly.''
</P>
<P>
   She soon was hired for a series of commercials with Magic the
dog, Morgan Fairchild, Rob Sporrer and others, wearing a copy of
her glasses with non-reflective lenses.  &QL;

RESEARCH LINKS BREAST, OVARIAN CANCER RISKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CAROLYN POIROT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Women with breast cancer _ especially minority women who have
breast cancer before age 50 _ are much more likely to develop
ovarian cancer than the general female population, research data
show.
</P>
<P>
   Early-breast-cancer survivors have been known to be at higher
risk for second breast cancers and cancers of the digestive tract,
but research on the link between breast and ovarian cancer has only
recently been pursued.
</P>
<P>
   The link is not surprising, because the two cancers share risk
factors, including a higher risk among women who have their first
period earlier and reach menopause later in life, those who have no
children and those who have a family history of breast or ovarian
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   What is surprising is the finding that although Asian and
Hispanic women have a lower risk of breast cancer overall, Asian
women with early breast cancer have a threefold risk of developing
ovarian cancer, and Hispanic women have a fourfold risk, says Dr.
Wendy Brewster, clinical instructor in gynecological oncology at
the University of California at Irvine.
</P>
<P>
   White women, who have the lowest risk of breast cancer, have a
1.79-fold risk of developing ovarian cancer if their breast cancer
is diagnosed before the age of 50, and African-American women have
a twofold risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was very interesting and expected was the highest risk
for ovarian cancer was among those women who were diagnosed with
breast cancer before 50 years, and they had a threefold risk,
overall,'' Brewster says.
</P>
<P>
   She headed a multicenter study looking at 120,000 breast-cancer
patients. She reported initial results at last month's meeting of
the Ovarian Cancer National Alliance in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   The study does not distinguish between primary and metastatic
ovarian cancer and does not take genetics or family history into
account, Brewster says.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 120,000 breast-cancer subjects, 16,000 had an additional
malignancy, most commonly in the digestive track or second breast;
however, 478 developed ovarian cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Brewster says the new data point up the fact that minority women
who have had breast cancer should be considered a high-risk group
for ovarian cancer and might well benefit from screening to detect
the development of ovarian cancer early.
</P>
<P>
   Her research is aimed at developing new ways to estimate cancer
risks in particular population bases.
</P>
<P>
   She says she has no definitive answer as to why minority women
with early breast cancer are at increased risk for ovarian cancer,
but identification of high-risks groups becomes more important as
tests are developed for different kinds of cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Ovarian cancer is the fifth most common cancer among women and
causes more deaths than any other cancer of the female reproductive
system.
</P>
<P>
   Promising drugs have been developed in recent years, but the
overall five-year survival rate is still only 40 percent to 45
percent. As with most cancers, survival is directly related to the
stage at which it is diagnosed.
</P>
<P>
   A nETWORK OF YOUNG SURVIVORS
</P>
<P>
   LaShawn Woodward was only 14 when she developed ovarian cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Leakage from her tumor made her stomach swell, and her doctor
first suspected that she was pregnant. She knew that couldn't be.
</P>
<P>
   Her doctor diagnosed the problem as gastritis.
</P>
<P>
   ``The doctor told me to go home and take Tums,'' recalls
Woodward, now 22.
</P>
<P>
   When neither Tums nor Mylanta brought any relief, the tumor was
discovered and surgically removed, along with her left ovary.
Follow-up radiation damaged the right ovary, and she went through
menopause at 15.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some young survivors, women who have survived this
disease for many years. I've met women that were 5 (when ovarian
cancer was diagnosed) that survived, that were 10, 14, 15, 16,
17,''says Woodward, founder of Young Survivors of Ovarian Cancer.
She lives in Mitchellville, Md., near Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel ovarian cancer is mainly discussed among older women.
The public, the media, doctors don't really think of younger women
who have survived ovarian cancer or will,'' says Woodward. ``Being
young, African-American, no previous family history of breast
cancer, no ovarian cancer _ I was the only one in my family _ no
one suspected ovarian cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   Woodward spoke at the Ovarian Cancer National Alliance's media
briefing, preceding last month's national advocacy conference in
Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Last March, she started the support group to help survivors
under the age of 30, especially those experiencing the emotional
and physical changes associated with early menopause.
</P>
<P>
   They talk about things like peer relationships and intimacy and
plans to have kids and hormonal therapy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Menopause itself can be difficult to handle when you are so
young. Your emotions go up and down, and you don't know which way
is happy, which sad,'' says Woodward, who is a student at Prince
George's Community College. She also works full time as a librarian
and volunteers with the organization she heads. ``You tend to lose
friends. My peers couldn't understand why I don't menstruate. You
tell them you have cancer and they say, `Oh, God, you have what?'
They just don't know how to handle you.''
</P>
<P>
   NEW BLOOD TEST AIMS AT EARLY DETECTION
</P>
<P>
   A promising new blood test that uses a small fat molecule to
identify early-stage ovarian cancer is very near testing in women
at risk for ovarian tumors.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers hope to begin clinical trials on the tumor marker by
the end of this year, says Dr. Gordon Mills, chairman of the
molecular oncology department at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Mills presented data on the new blood test at last month's
annual meeting of the Ovarian Cancer National Alliance in
Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   The blood test can also be used to monitor patients and help
determine which ovarian tumors are growing quickly, when they
become invasive, when they begin to metastasize, and when they are
not responding to drugs available to treat them, Mills said at a
briefing for medical and science writers preceding the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very exciting time in cancer research. We are
beginning to understand the genetic changes involved in the cancer
process,'' Mills said.
</P>
<P>
   Because cellular ``markers'' identify the different changes,
they can be used to alert doctors that a cancer is developing, to
monitor the disease process and to determine which drugs are most
effective in treating the cancer at various stages of the disease.
</P>
<P>
   In Mills' study of 265 ovarian cancer samples, the new Atairgin
blood test detected 75 percent of early-stage cancer samples with
95 percent accuracy.
</P>
<P>
   The test measures a specific fat molecule in the blood that is
exceedingly high during the development of ovarian tumors and may
therefore provide an early means to detect ovarian cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Early detection is critical because the five-year survival rate
for women with ovarian cancer rises to 95 percent in patients with
early-stage disease. However, with no screening test available,
most ovarian cancer is not detected until later stages, when the
survival rate averages only 28 percent. Overall survival rate is
now 40 percent to 45 percent, according to reports presented at the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors also reported that at least eight new drugs are being
developed to fight ovarian cancer, including several that are
already in use against other kinds of cancer, and confirmed earlier
reports that long-term use of the birth control pill cuts the risk
of ovarian cancer in half.

   Q: I have several copper pans that need to be re-tinned. Do you
know of any place where I can have this done?
</P>
<P>
   _W. P. Smith, Stone Mountain (Ga.)
</P>
<P>
   A: We found a ``tin'' man for you in New York: Jamie Gibbons,
owner of Retinning and Copper Repair, 525 W. 26th St., New York, NY
10001 (212-244-4896). For more than 80 years, this waterfront
workshop has been rejuvenating copper cookware. In the early days,
according to Gibbons, steamships would come into port and the cooks
on board would bring their pots and pans via horse and buggy to the
shop. Today, people from all over the country send their wares via
FedEx and express mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``Copper cookware is favored by chefs everywhere,'' says
Gibbons. ``It heats evenly, cools quickly and lasts forever.''
However, copper must be lined with tin, to protect the food, and
tin wears out. The cost of re-tinning is $3 an inch. You measure a
pan from the rim, down the side, across the bottom and back up the
other side of the pan. Measure oval and rectangle pans lengthwise.
For example, a 10- to 13-quart mixing bowl is $30, a 20-quart bowl
is $40. Allow three to six weeks for re-tinning an item. You can
read about the company on its Web site, www.retinning.com.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am experiencing serious withdrawal symptoms from the lack
of Ice Cube chocolate candy _ little squares of milk chocolate
wrapped in a metallic silver-and-blue wrapper. I found them only
once in Atlanta. Will you please help me find a steady supply of
this chocolate candy?
</P>
<P>
   _Michele Bowman, Atlanta
</P>
<P>
   Another sweet request: I would like to know if Junket Rennet
Custard is available anywhere. It's been a long time since I've
seen any Junket products, which could be used in making homemade
ice cream, cheese, etc.
</P>
<P>
   _Mrs. E.G. Cox, Marietta(Ga.)
</P>
<P>
   And another Junket request: If you could find Junket for me, it
would make a semi-old man so happy. It was a dessert my mother made
for me and my wife made for our son. It was a little like pudding
but much lighter.
</P>
<P>
   _Jerrold Siegal, Roswell(Ga.)
</P>
<P>
   A: Sweets for the sweet. Both of these items, Ice Cube candy and
Junket dessert mixes, are available through Hometown Favorites.
This Florida-based mail-order company specializes in hard-to-find
food, candy and condiments. It has over 400 items on its shelves.
The Ice Cube chocolates are 35 cents apiece. Junket comes as a
custard mix in vanilla, chocolate, strawberry and raspberry; as a
Danish dessert in raspberry or strawberry; and as an ice cream mix
in vanilla, chocolate and strawberry. Each box is $1.25. To order:
1-888-694-2656. Minimum order is $15. Or access the Web site at
www.hometownfavorites.com.
</P>
<P>
   Junket fans can also order their dessert favorites directly from
Redco Foods: 1-800-556-6674.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am looking for ``dulce de leche,'' a marvelous sweet spread
from Argentina that tastes somewhat like a caramel-flavored
sweetened condensed milk. So far, I've located it via the Internet
at several stores in New York, but surely there must be a local
store that carries it.
</P>
<P>
   _Kay Wolfe, Atlanta
</P>
<P>
   A: You're right. Taqueria el Molina carries La Lechera, a
sweetened condensed milk, at its two locations: 3976 Buford Highway
N.E. (404-982-0994) and 2000-A Cheshire Bridge Road N.E.
(404-636-8714). It's $1.89 for a 12-ounce can. Made in Mexico by
Nestle, the milk can be used to make flan or as a spread on bread
for a snack.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Could you please find Unguentine Plus, an antiseptic cream
made by the Mentholatum Co.? The tube I have was purchased in West
Allis, Wis.
</P>
<P>
   _D.D. Loftin, Rome (Ga.)
</P>
<P>
   A: This cream has been a favorite of Dr. Moms for years, as a
first aid for burns, cuts and insect bites. It also prevents
infection and temporarily relieves itching, according to the
manufacturer. A 1-ounce tube is $4.49 at Miller's Rexall, 87 Broad
St. N.W. (404-523-8481). Sandy Springs Pharmacy, 6329 Roswell Road
N.E. (404-252-8165) carries the 1-ounce tube for $3.69. Or you can
order Unguentine Plus from the company at 1-800-688-9046 for $3.70
plus shipping.

SHEEDY AS `HEDWIG': TAKING ON THE GLAM ROCK DIVA (AND GENDER GAP) 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Skedded earlier as HEDWIG-SHEEDY.) 
(th) 
 By PETER MARKS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Deep into the run of an established hit it's time to
take chances, and with the casting of Ally Sheedy in the title
role, ``Hedwig and the Angry Inch'' took a huge one.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sheedy, who has matured in recent years into an intelligent
actress of offbeat charisma _ catch her brooding lesbian
photographer on video in the indie film ``High Art'' _ is to say
the least an unlikely choice for Hedwig, and only partly because
the role of the drag queen in progress, mutilated on an East Berlin
operating table, was written for a man.
</P>
<P>
   Hedwig is also a would-be rock star, in other words, a drag
queen with a set of pipes. And on this fundamental basis Ms.
Sheedy's portrayal lacks the requisite dynamism. She has the will
to play Hedwig, but musically speaking, has not found a compelling
way.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent performance she had pitch and other vocal problems
on a half-dozen songs in Stephen Trask's demanding score; after her
voice took a pummeling in the powerhouse title song ``Angry Inch,''
she had little left for the soulful and softer ``Wig in a Box'' and
``Wicked Little Town,'' two of the 10 numbers she must put over in
the course of an evening in which Hedwig also talks to us virtually
nonstop.
</P>
<P>
   It has become acceptable these days for name actors with merely
passable voices to assume key singing roles in big musicals: both
Natasha Richardson and Jennifer Jason Leigh were cast, for
instance, as Sally Bowles in ``Cabaret.'' One could argue they add
color and emotional dimension in their renditions, but it is
inarguable that in the absence of technique and a natural ease with
music, something vital is lost as well.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sheedy was the choice of John Cameron Mitchell, who
conceived and wrote the book for the show and originated the role
of Hedwig, in which he was spectacular. He has said he saw in Ms.
Sheedy, who had burned out after an early success in Hollywood, a
reflection of his vision of Hedwig, a show-biz survivor who grows
weary of the facade he has chosen and ultimately reinvents himself
before our eyes.
</P>
<P>
   The show, which mocks the conventions of rock stardom, takes us
through Hedwig's downwardly spiraling career and life, from his
botched sex-change operation, to his performances as a drag star in
Midwestern dives, to his sordid entanglement with Tommy Gnosis, the
rock icon Hedwig discovered and tutored on a Kansas Army base.
</P>
<P>
   Onstage at the Jane Street Theater, though, Ms. Sheedy, whose
movie career is once again thriving, seems altogether too
tentative. You can admire the gutsiness of the attempt, but you can
also sense a lack of belief.
</P>
<P>
   Drag is a comic art. Its spirit is in its outrageousness,
attested to in Hedwig's garish get-ups, and its practitioners revel
in the form's ridiculously exaggerated notion of the boundary
between genders. When a man plays a woman, you're always, but
always, aware of something out of kilter under the tresses.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Hedwig,'' Ms. Sheedy is as unambiguously a woman as
Mitchell was a man. In the abstract the idea of this gender
substitution might be playful.
</P>
<P>
   The inescapable reality, however, is that this is a musical
about sexual ambiguity, and when that idea is subverted so
consciously, the show proves a lot less thrilling. The
double-entendres and the myriad jokes at Hedwig's expense simply
don't make as much sense. Even Ms. Sheedy's German accent is
unconvincing.
</P>
<P>
   It is painful to have to report such disappointing results,
especially when they involve a show so inventively theatrical and
an actress so willing to put herself on the line. Sometimes, the
matchmaker can't make a match.

   The New York Times News Service will move the following

<P>
   &UR; FEATURE story &LR;
</P>
<P>
   DISCO-MUSIC (subslug) (New York) _ When the Broadway musical
version of ``Saturday Night Fever'' opens on at the Thursday
Minskoff Theater, it should, by rights, look as quaint as the 1950s
of ``Grease'' did in the 1970s. ``Saturday Night Fever,'' the movie
released in 1977, marked the apogee of disco, a lucrative moment in
pop that quickly generated a backlash, a record-business crash and
a widespread repudiation. Twenty years is the usual nostalgia gap,
the time it takes for fond memory to replace the embarrassment of
succumbing to a long-gone trend; hence the Broadway-bound
``Saturday Night Fever,'' despite disparaging reviews of its London
production. By Jon Pareles. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FILM AND VIDEO &LR;
</P>
<P>
   SAME-OLD-SONG-FILM (Paris) _ Alain Resnais seemed quite amused
by the idea that it took him 35 years to have his first genuine box
office hit. Of course, at 77, he could well afford to display
nonchalance, what with his place in the history of modern cinema
having long been assured by his remarkable first two feature films,
``Hiroshima Mon Amour'' and ``Last Year at Marienbad.'' Even so,
the success of his latest movie, ``On Connait La Chanson,'' or
``Same Old Song,'' surprised him. Much of the charm of ``Same Old
Song,'' which opened in New York on Friday, derives from the way
its six main characters lip-synch popular French songs. By Alan
Riding. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   JOE-THE-KING-FILM (Undated) _ In ``Joe the King,'' which opened
on Friday, Frank Whaley has made an intensely affecting yet
unsentimental movie about a lost child. That the film contains a
large dollop of autobiography _ it is dedicated to his parents _
only makes this 36-year-old actor's achievement more striking.
``Joe the King'' is Whaley's first outing as a writer and director,
and if this is what's considered a small film, it's an
exceptionally rich one. The movie won the screenwriting award at
this year's Sundance Festival. By Karen Durbin.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DANCE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   AMERICAN-BALLET (New York) _ More than most dance companies,
American Ballet Theater prides itself on its versatility. And
rightly so. Last spring it presented ``Giselle'' and other Old
World heirlooms. For the fall season, which opens on Tuesday and
runs for two weeks at the City Center, the troupe will flaunt its
progressive side, taking on the macabre expressionism of Agnes de
Mille, the wry populism of Twyla Tharp and the quicksilver
partnering of Nacho Duato. By Christopher Reardon. (Moved). Photo.

<P>
   &UR; CLASSICAL MUSIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ST.-FRANCIS-OPERA (Undated) _ As it becomes clear that Gerard
Mortier will be replaced as director of the Salzburg Festival when
his contract expires in 2002, a new release of Olivier Messiaen's
lone, immense opera ``St. Francois d'Assise,'' which was present on
the program of his first year at the festival, is especially
timely. The new release (Deutsche Grammophon 445 176-2; four CDs),
was recorded at a revival last year. By Paul Griffiths. (Moved).
 &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   TRANSPOSED-MUSIC (New York) _ Transposition is in the news at
the Metropolitan Opera. Sir Charles Mackerras has just opened a run
of ``Lucia di Lammermoor'' with three large chunks of the score
restored to the higher keys in which the composer originally wrote
them, and at the same time Placido Domingo is reprising two of his
most celebrated roles, the tragic clown of ``Pagliacci'' and the
tormented Moor of ``Otello,'' with adjustments in the other
direction to accommodate the autumnal range of his tenor voice.
Both circumstances are being discussed extensively _ even heatedly
_ and both are being a bit misunderstood as often as not. By Will
Crutchfield. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; POP MUSIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   LOMAX-DELTA-BLUES (Undated) _ In 1941 and 1942, the folklorist
Alan Lomax visited the Mississippi Delta to document its
African-American folk music. One of his major objectives was to
record the Delta's most famous cultural product, the blues.
``Mississippi the Blues Lineage'' (Rounder 11661-1825), whose
contents Lomax selected before a stroke incapacitated him several
years ago, represents his early-40s Delta blues fieldwork. By Tony
Scherman. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ART &LR;
</P>
<P>
   COLOMBIA-ART (Bogota, Colombia) _ Gloria Zea, director of the
Museum of Modern Art here, in an effort to provoke what she calls
``a profound and unhurried meditation'' that can ``help change
behaviors and habits that impede civil discourse,'' her museum, the
capital's most prestigious, has organized the first systematic
examination of ``the scourge that has bled the country dry,'' as
she puts it, in an unsettling exhibition entitled ``Art and
Violence in Colombia Since 1948.'' Each of the show's dozen
sections, spread over four floors, addresses one specific
manifestation of the violence that afflicts this nation of 40
million people. By Larry Rohter. (Moved).
</P>
<P>
   ARTISTS-RETREATS (Undated) _ In a late 20th-century version of
J.M.W. Turner's search for the untrammeled landscape, a small band
of contemporary artists is spending this month trekking in the
Himalayas, seeking fresh vision as well as fresh scenery. This is
part of new versions of the artist residency program in which
traditionally, artists retreat for sabbaticals in bucolic,
cloistered settings like Yaddo or the MacDowell Colony. Now artists
may convene in gritty urban environments, participate in group
living experiments or join far-flung adventures resembling Outward
Bound. By Ann Wilson Lloyd.

IN BOOST FOR FLAGGING CAMPAIGN ,  AFL-CIO ENDORSES GORE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Vice President Al Gore's flagging campaign
Wednesday received the biggest boost in weeks as he overwhelmingly
won the endorsement of the 13 million-member AFL-CIO, which
promptly promised to send thousands of organizers to key states to
work for him.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, whose entrance was accompanied by a Latin musical score,
was welcomed in the Los Angeles convention center like a hometown
hero by hundreds of top union officials and delegates, many of whom
have known him for years. An energized Gore practically danced
through the crowd as he made his way to the podium, pumping dozens
of hands along the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the AFL-CIO by my side, I know we're going to win this
nomination next summer, as we will win the presidency next
November,'' Gore said. ``I pledge to you today: As president of the
United States, I will be the voice for working families.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's slide in the polls has come partly because his rival for
the Democratic presidential nomination, former New Jersey Senator
Bill Bradley, has run to the left of the vice president on issues
such as health insurance and gun control. Gore used Wednesday's
event to say he has stronger ties to labor than Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said he has been pro-labor even though he comes from
Tennessee, a right-to-work state. He said that his father worked
for the first minimum wage of 25 cents.
</P>
<P>
   The main objection to the endorsement came from the 1.4-million
member International Brotherhood of Teamsters, which urged a delay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe there is not a more momentous decision than the one
we make here today,'' said Teamster President James P. Hoffa, the
main speaker against the endorsement. ``Our `no' vote is neither
criticism of Vice President Gore nor a sign of support for Senator
Bradley. We should allow the local union officers and members to
learn more about the candidates. Our members have made it clear
they don't want to be told how to vote. They want information, not
voting instruction.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Teamster officials spoke more bluntly.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the South, we always say, `Don't wrap that pig, weigh it.'
And we'd like to have it weighed before it's wrapped,'' Teamster
Jerry Vincent of Kentucky said in a speech on the convention floor.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the endorsement was orchestrated largely by AFL-CIO
President John J. Sweeney, who has worked closely with Gore for
several years and persuaded many reluctant union heads to back the
vice president.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this compressed election season, I believe this endorsement
at this time represents our best ability to act and to make a
difference,'' Sweeney said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has received the endorsement of dozens of top elected
officials and various organizations, none of which has stopped his
recent slide in the polls. But AFL-CIO officials said their
endorsement is different because it will translate into
on-the-ground activism, with thousands of organizers sent to key
primary and caucus states. The union also has millions of dollars
at its disposal to help Gore, although Sweeney said corporations
vastly outspend the unions.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley had hoped to at least delay Gore's endorsement, and he
arranged his schedule to be in Los Angeles in anticipation of
speaking to the 700 delegates at the convention. But Bradley
decided not to speak to the gathering at the Los Angeles convention
center when he learned that Gore would be given overwhelming
support from the AFL-CIO.
</P>
<P>
   After the endorsement, Bradley issued a statement thanking the
union members who have supported him.
</P>
<P>
   ``My commitment to working men and women and the role that labor
can play in their lives is unwavering,'' Bradley said. ``I will
advocate for workers and stand with them as they organize to
improve life for Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoffa and other Teamster officials have met repeatedly with
Bradley, who recently sided with the Teamsters' position against
allowing Mexican trucks with imported goods from crossing the US
border until more inspectors are hired. Gore has said he is
reviewing the issue. But both Gore and Bradley back the North
American Free Trade Agreement, which has drawn the ire of the
Teamsters and some other unions.
</P>
<P>
   The United Auto Workers also opposed the Gore endorsement, but
no UAW official spoke on the convention floor. The endorsement,
which needed a two-thirds majority, was passed by voice vote.
</P>
<P>
   No Republican presidential candidates appeared here to seek the
endorsement, although AFL-CIO officials said an invitation was sent
to them. Republican National Committee Chairman Jim Nicholson
Wednesday played down the importance of the endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's divided vote by AFL-CIO shows two things: how
desperate the Al Gore campaign has become and how divided the labor
movement is,'' Nicholson said. ``The strong-arm tactics of union
boss John Sweeney in ramming this premature endorsement down the
throats of rank-and-file union members will ultimately be a wasted
and vain effort because it won't stop the Gore campaign's tailspin
any more than the early endorsement of another failed liberal,
Walter Mondale, did in 1984.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore spokesman Chris Lehane, told of Nicholson's comment,
responded: ``The RNC's effort on behalf of working people has been
a wasted and vain effort because it has been no effort.''

   ``Who I Was Supposed to Be: Stories''
</P>
<P>
   by Susan Perabo
</P>
<P>
   Short fiction
</P>
<P>
   Simon &AMP; Schuster, $20
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't deserve this life,'' a mother says, lamenting the role
she's been forced into by her daughter's desultory love life. That
sentiment _ what could have been, what should have been, what yet
might be _ resonates in much of ``Who I Was Supposed to Be:
Stories,'' a quirky and engaging collection by Susan Perabo.
</P>
<P>
   There are well-drawn portraits here of men and women longing to
relive the past or trying to invigorate their humdrum lives.
</P>
<P>
   The stories' real strength, however, is their twists, many of
which catch the reader completely off-guard _ a retired shop owner
who turns to a new kind of business, a divorced man who finds an
unusual way of spending time with his ex-wife, an unhappy woman who
visits her hometown and unexpectedly benefits from her mother's
addiction to lottery tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Perabo displays great range in tone and voice, and she tackles a
variety of subjects, ridiculous and serious. Throughout, Perabo
maintains a light touch. An often ironic humor suffuses each tale,
either in the main focus or in the details.
</P>
<P>
   In one case, Perabo approaches the same basic theme from
opposite directions. The absurdity of ``Explaining Death to the
Dog,'' for example, in which the narrator tries to do just that, is
balanced by the devastation of the child who narrates ``Gravity,''
which opens with, ``It rained the morning of the day we killed
Dennis Zeller.'' Both stories examine the aftermath of death, but
in strikingly different ways.
</P>
<P>
   More lighthearted is the aptly titled ``Thick as Thieves,'' a
largely typical narrative of a rich-but-aging man with a faltering
Hollywood career and a failing marriage. He has ``only one
worthwhile story to tell,'' about his father, whom he never knew
well, having left home as a teen-ager. His father comes for a
visit, and the two men get to know each other. Into this tired
scenario Perabo injects an oddity that lifts the tale well clear of
cliche.
</P>
<P>
   In the middle of the collection comes the only tale with a
fantastic setting and characters, although it's still cast in a
realistic style. ``Retirement'' is told in the third person, from
the perspective of Alfred, butler to Bruce Wayne, aka Batman. The
opening sentence, ``Alfred was out of Pepto-Bismol,'' is the first
clue to how funny and earthy this well-paced story is.
</P>
<P>
   Even the stories that strike false notes are worth reading for
their quirks, sometimes even their settings. In ``The Rocks Over
Kyburz,'' for example, a father who longs for simpler days finds
that his sons are growing up faster than he thought. It's
well-executed up to a point _ the point, long before the final
page, at which the reader guesses what's going on even while the
father exhibits a naivete that's hard to believe.
</P>
<P>
   The ending of ``Measure of Devotion'' also disappoints, but
because it's too pat. The story does gain, however, from its
background action, a tour of the battlefields at Gettysburg.
</P>
<P>
   Even where Perabo achieves her overall aim, smaller problems mar
the effort. ``Counting the Ways,'' for example, is certainly
bizarre enough to hold the reader's interest, using a dress once
owned by Princess Diana to reveal the fault lines in a married
couple's relationship.
</P>
<P>
   However, some of the symbolism is heavy-handed, the psychology
murky (''The magic of the dress had finally worn off, and she had
tunneled back to that place inside her, the place with no name and
no address and no closing time.'') In a first-person narrative,
instances of the second person (''You're probably thinking I kissed
it or something, but I didn't.'') come out of nowhere and quickly
vanish, their purpose, if any, unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Those flaws don't significantly detract from the overall quality
of the stories, however, and the result is amusing and thoughtful
fare.

 &HT;    BLACK CAUCUS RALLIES SUPPORT FOR CAROLINA FLOOD VICTIMS
 &HT;    380&AMP;add.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rallying behind Rep. Eva Clayton, D-N.C., black
lawmakers launched an effort Wednesday to develop a ``Marshall
Plan'' to rebuild flood-ravaged eastern North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy includes reaching out to both parties in Congress,
churches and non-profit groups, private companies and Hollywood
entertainers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will take several years and a lot of money,'' Clayton said
at a Capitol Hill press conference. ``Emergency housing is needed,
home repair and replacement is a priority, essential property has
been lost, many are out of jobs. ... Hopelessness is setting in.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., who is co-chairing a task force on
emergency aid for hurricane victims, said the crisis requires
something similar to the Marshall Plan, which provided extensive
aid for post-war reconstruction of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``America has always shown compassion whenever devastation has
hit throughout the world _ especially in Eastern Europe and the
Middle East,'' he said. ``Now we have been struck at home.''
</P>
<P>
   Rangel said the Congressional Black Caucus is working on several
fronts to help those devastated by flooding. Some members are
assigned to reach out to colleagues in Congress in an effort to
pass emergency aid measures.
</P>
<P>
   One such effort consists of $2.5 billion in emergency aid
included in a larger spending bill. That amount is for hurricane
victims in several states, including North Carolina. The House may
vote on the measure as soon as next week.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Rangel said the Caucus is arranging for members of
Congress to visit hurricane-damaged areas so they can witness the
impact first-hand and bring messages of hope to residents.
</P>
<P>
   Another part of the plan involves reaching out to corporations,
such as the Fannie Mae Foundation, which Rangel praised for
contributing $175,000 to non-profit groups working to provide
permanent replacement housing for families who lost their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Caucus members said they will also call on Hollywood to raise
awareness and contribute money to rebuilding efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Maxine Waters, D-N.C., said she would contact members of
the entertainment community, including producer Quincy Jones,
Motown founder Barry Gordy Jr. and actor Denzel Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not called on them much in the past, but now is the
time that we need them,'' she said. ``We've got to help each
other.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   At the press conference, movie actor Bill Duke, whose face is
much more familiar than his name, spoke of the historical
importance of Eastern North Carolina, including Princeville, the
oldest town in the country incorporated by freed slaves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Businesses have been wiped out there, churches, homes and
people are really, really suffering,'' he said. ``I call on all
Americans, particularly my affluent friends in Los Angeles _
producers, actors, writers _to support this effort one thousand
percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Princeville, in Edgecombe County, was submerged in 23 feet of
water for 10 days after Hurricane Floyd. Almost all of the town's
650 homes, 30 businesses and three churches were damaged or
destroyed. The situation is aggravated by the fact that about half
of the residents are senior citizens, who may be too weary and too
poor to start over.
</P>
<P>
   Clayton said that the Caucus wants to help all those hurt by the
floods, including but not limited to disadvantaged communities,
senior citizens and minority communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not exclusive,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   At the press conference, Rep. Martin Frost, D-Texas, Democratic
Congressional Campaign Committee chairman, said his party will
fully support relief efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Black Caucus year in and year out has stood behind the
rest of us when we've asked for help on a variety of things, and
the entire Democratic Caucus wants to be involved in this
project,'' he said.

   Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., who is co-chairing a task force on
emergency aid for hurricane victims, said the crisis requires
something similar to the Marshall Plan, which provided extensive
aid for post-war reconstruction of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``America has always shown compassion whenever devastation has
hit throughout the world _ especially in Eastern Europe and the
Middle East,'' he said. ``Now we have been struck at home.''
</P>
<P>
   Rangel said the Congressional Black Caucus is working on several
fronts to help those devastated by flooding. Some members are
assigned to reach out to colleagues in Congress in an effort to
pass emergency aid measures.
</P>
<P>
   One such effort consists of $2.5 billion in emergency aid
included in a larger spending bill. That amount is for hurricane
victims in several states, including North Carolina. The House may
vote on the measure as soon as next week.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Rangel said the Caucus is arranging for members of
Congress to visit hurricane-damaged areas so they can witness the
impact first-hand and bring messages of hope to residents.
</P>
<P>
   Another part of the plan involves reaching out to corporations,
such as the Fannie Mae Foundation, which Rangel praised for
contributing $175,000 to non-profit groups working to provide
permanent replacement housing for families who lost their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Caucus members said they will also call on Hollywood to raise
awareness and contribute money to rebuilding efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., said she would contact members of
the entertainment community, including producer Quincy Jones,
Motown founder Barry Gordy Jr. and actor Denzel Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have not called on them much in the past, but now is the
time that we need them,'' she said. ``We've got to help each
other.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   At the press conference, movie actor Bill Duke, whose face is
much more familiar than his name, spoke of the historical
importance of Eastern North Carolina, including Princeville, the
oldest town in the country incorporated by freed slaves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Businesses have been wiped out there, churches, homes and
people are really, really suffering,'' he said. ``I call on all
Americans, particularly my affluent friends in Los Angeles _
producers, actors, writers _to support this effort one thousand
percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Princeville, in Edgecombe County, was submerged in 23 feet of
water for 10 days after Hurricane Floyd. Almost all of the town's
650 homes, 30 businesses and three churches were damaged or
destroyed. The situation is aggravated by the fact that about half
of the residents are senior citizens, who may be too weary and too
poor to start over.
</P>
<P>
   Clayton said that the Caucus wants to help all those hurt by the
floods, including but not limited to disadvantaged communities,
senior citizens and minority communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not exclusive,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   At the press conference, Rep. Martin Frost, D-Texas, Democratic
Congressional Campaign Committee chairman, said his party will
fully support relief efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Black Caucus year in and year out has stood behind the
rest of us when we've asked for help on a variety of things, and
the entire Democratic Caucus wants to be involved in this
project,'' he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Deep into the run of an established hit it's time to
take chances, and with the casting of Ally Sheedy in the title
role, ``Hedwig and the Angry Inch'' took a huge one.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sheedy, who has matured in recent years into an intelligent
actress of offbeat charisma _ catch her brooding lesbian
photographer on video in the indie film ``High Art'' _ is to say
the least an unlikely choice for Hedwig, and only partly because
the role of the drag queen in progress, mutilated on an East Berlin
operating table, was written for a man.
</P>
<P>
   Hedwig is also a would-be rock star, in other words, a drag
queen with a set of pipes. And on this fundamental basis Ms.
Sheedy's portrayal lacks the requisite dynamism. She has the will
to play Hedwig, but musically speaking, has not found a compelling
way.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent performance she had pitch and other vocal problems
on a half-dozen songs in Stephen Trask's demanding score; after her
voice took a pummeling in the powerhouse title song ``Angry Inch,''
she had little left for the soulful and softer ``Wig in a Box'' and
``Wicked Little Town,'' two of the 10 numbers she must put over in
the course of an evening in which Hedwig also talks to us virtually
nonstop.
</P>
<P>
   It has become acceptable these days for name actors with merely
passable voices to assume key singing roles in big musicals: both
Natasha Richardson and Jennifer Jason Leigh were cast, for
instance, as Sally Bowles in ``Cabaret.'' One could argue they add
color and emotional dimension in their renditions, but it is
inarguable that in the absence of technique and a natural ease with
music, something vital is lost as well.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Sheedy was the choice of John Cameron Mitchell, who
conceived and wrote the book for the show and originated the role
of Hedwig, in which he was spectacular. He has said he saw in Ms.
Sheedy, who had burned out after an early success in Hollywood, a
reflection of his vision of Hedwig, a show-biz survivor who grows
weary of the facade he has chosen and ultimately reinvents himself
before our eyes.
</P>
<P>
   The show, which mocks the conventions of rock stardom, takes us
through Hedwig's downwardly spiraling career and life, from his
botched sex-change operation, to his performances as a drag star in
Midwestern dives, to his sordid entanglement with Tommy Gnosis, the
rock icon Hedwig discovered and tutored on a Kansas Army base.
</P>
<P>
   Onstage at the Jane Street Theater, though, Ms. Sheedy, whose
movie career is once again thriving, seems altogether too
tentative. You can admire the gutsiness of the attempt, but you can
also sense a lack of belief.
</P>
<P>
   Drag is a comic art. Its spirit is in its outrageousness,
attested to in Hedwig's garish get-ups, and its practitioners revel
in the form's ridiculously exaggerated notion of the boundary
between genders. When a man plays a woman, you're always, but
always, aware of something out of kilter under the tresses.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Hedwig,'' Ms. Sheedy is as unambiguously a woman as
Mitchell was a man. In the abstract the idea of this gender
substitution might be playful.
</P>
<P>
   The inescapable reality, however, is that this is a musical
about sexual ambiguity, and when that idea is subverted so
consciously, the show proves a lot less thrilling. The
double-entendres and the myriad jokes at Hedwig's expense simply
don't make as much sense. Even Ms. Sheedy's German accent is
unconvincing.
</P>
<P>
   It is painful to have to report such disappointing results,
especially when they involve a show so inventively theatrical and
an actress so willing to put herself on the line. Sometimes, the
matchmaker can't make a match.
</P>

 &HT;    AFL-CIO GETS TRADE CONCESSIONS IN EXCHANGE FOR GORE ENDORSEMENT
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The nation's largest union organization threw the
electoral weight of its 13-million membership behind Vice President
Al Gore's presidential campaign Wednesday following days of
backroom political horse-trading on future trade agreements.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, seeking a crucial victory in what campaign aides
characterized as ``the first primary'' in the Democratic
presidential contest with former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley, won
over wavering affiliates of the AFL-CIO by reiterating his pledge
to insist on enforceable labor and environmental rights in future
trade negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trade should lift up living standards around the world, not
drag them down in the United States,'' Gore said in a speech to the
700 delegates to the AFL-CIO convention as he celebrated the
endorsement from their 68-union federation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe our president needs the authority to reach new trade
agreements and open new markets to our goods and services,'' he
added. ``But as president, I will also insist on and use the
authority to enforce worker rights, human rights and environmental
protections in those agreements.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the labor leaders, Gore sought to paper over trade
differences by touting the economic gains under the Clinton
administration and by promising to veto any ``anti-union bill''
that would come to him as president.
</P>
<P>
   BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a Reagan-Bush recession. There was a Bush-Quayle
recession, but there's never been a Clinton-Gore recession because
we've been following policies that are good for working families,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   END OPTIONAL TRIM
</P>
<P>
   But greater flexibility in trade negotiations is what the more
recalcitrant leaders within the labor federation had hoped for
before extending an endorsement that is pivotal in the vice
president's effort to retool his campaign for the Democratic
presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   And that is what they sought in their private meetings with Gore
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM
</P>
<P>
   ``The vice president is prepared to be flexible in his search
for a solution to the problems being created by unrestrained
trade,'' George Becker, president of the United Steelworkers of
America, said after the endorsement on a voice vote of the
delegates.
</P>
<P>
   Becker had been one of the most vocal critics of the Clinton
administration's free-trade policies, blaming them for some of the
massive loss of U.S. manufacturing jobs over the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   But Becker said ``frank and straightforward'' talks with the
vice president convinced him that ``Gore understands the cost in
human terms of unrestrained free trade'' and is committed to
``approach trade so that conditions for workers throughout the
world are leveled up, instead of down.''
</P>
<P>
   END OPTIONAL TRIM
</P>
<P>
   Chris Lehane, the vice president's spokesman, confirmed that
Gore has promised to make labor and environmental rights a part of
all trade talks.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's commitments on trade failed, however, to win over the
International Brotherhood of Teamsters or the United Auto Workers,
two of the largest affiliates of the 68-union AFL-CIO.
</P>
<P>
   BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM
</P>
<P>
   It also failed to sway some of the rank-and-file union members
who spoke briefly during the floor debate on the endorsement
resolution, which called Gore a ``champion of unions.''
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Vincent, a Teamsters member from Kentucky, cautioned the
AFL-CIO against endorsing any candidate until it has thoroughly
reviewed their records and commitments. ``Don't wrap that pig;
weigh it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   END OPTIONAL TRIM
</P>
<P>
   The Teamsters and the Auto Workers are seeking further
concessions from Gore, particularly as the administration prepares
for upcoming talks in Seattle about possibly expanding the World
Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Organized labor opposes any expansion of WTO that would result
in a flood of cheap imports that would put Americans out of work.
Labor also wants tougher environmental protection provisions in
trade agreements.
</P>
<P>
   BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope when the vice president leaves here today that he will
take with him our concerns about the future,'' Teamsters President
James P. Hoffa said during the brief floor debate on the resolution
to endorse Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``The AFL-CIO will endorse today and next month we will go to
Seattle to protest against any possible expansion of the World
Trade Organization,'' Hoffa said. ``Is the vice president going to
listen? We hope so.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Hoffa sought to minimize any differences between
himself and AFL-CIO President John Sweeney, Teamsters spokesman
Chip Roth confirmed that Hoffa is seeking a meeting with Texas Gov.
George W. Bush, the Republican presidential front-runner, to
discuss trade issues.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush, like Gore and Bradley, is a free-trader. Consquently,
Gore, in his speech to the convention Wednesday, focused on
differences with the governor, most notably, Bush's opposition to a
federally mandated increase in the minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that Bush would allow states to opt out of any minimum
wage passed by the federal government, Gore said, ``I guess that's
Governor Bush's idea of compassionate conservatism _ states get to
choose one or the other.''
</P>
<P>
   Union labors have been furious with the Clinton administration
ever since the president and vice president pushed to pass the
North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). But throughout the
three-day convention here, they have downplayed their differences
with the administration over trade.
</P>
<P>
   Even the one-page resolution endorsing Gore over Bradley made no
mention of their differences over trade. Instead, it praised Gore
for using the power of his office ``to defend the freedom of
workers to choose a union.''
</P>
<P>
   The resolution acknowledged that Bradley ``has the respect of
many and a good record,'' but added that ``there is no question
that Al Gore is the presidential candidate most favored, or that
members support an endorsement of him at this time by an
overwhelming margin.''
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney, who engineered the Gore endorsement, said it was
important to back Gore now rather than later in order to wield as
much influence as possible in a compressed primary season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our leadership recognized that we must move quickly in order
to be full participants in what has become a front-loaded primary
process,'' Sweeney said.
</P>
<P>
   END OPTIONAL TRIM
</P>
<P>
   The AFL-CIO will not meet again until next spring, and it is
likely that either Gore or Bradley will have nailed down the
nomination by mid-March.
</P>
<P>
   The endorsement Wednesday will provide Gore with muscle and
money in the primary states, most importantly in Iowa, which will
hold the first presidential voting next January, and in New York,
where Bradley is in a virtual tie with the vice president.
</P>
<P>
   There are 150,000 active and retired AFL-CIO members in Iowa,
and some 400,000 in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The endorsement is less of an advantage in New Hampshire, which
will hold the first presidential primary. Only about 27,000
households in New Hampshire have union members.
</P>
<P>
   BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM
</P>
<P>
   But Lehane, Gore's press secretary, said the battle with Bradley
over the AFL-CIO's backing was ``the first primary - and we won.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Gore flew from Los Angeles to Seattle to meet with
machinist union members who work on the F-22 fighter jet, which is
threatened by budget cuts. About 1,000 people are employed in
Nashua, N.H., to make parts for the F-22.

SUPREME COURT QUESTIONS CALIFORNIA PRIVACY LAW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK HELM  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Weighing how far a state can go to protect the
privacy of its residents, several members of the Supreme Court on
Wednesday questioned whether a California law that limits access to
individuals' arrest records goes too far.
</P>
<P>
   The statute, which has not been implemented because of a court
challenge, would prevent state law enforcement agencies from
releasing the arrest records to businesses that use them for
pre-employment background checks and other commercial purposes.
</P>
<P>
   However, the law would allow the release of the records when the
information is used for a ``scholarly, journalistic, political or
governmental purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   The law, which would have gone into effect in June 1996, was
challenged by United Reporting Publishing Corporation, a Los
Angeles-based company that compiled and sold the arrest records to
attorneys, insurance companies, alcohol and drug counselors and
other businesses. The company argued that the law violated its
First Amendment right to free speech.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1996, a U.S. District Court judge agreed, blocking the
law from going into effect. The Los Angeles Police Department
appealed the ruling, but in 1998, the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of
Appeals decided against the California law, saying that it violated
United Reporting's commercial free-speech rights.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court's decision, expected by June, could provide
guidance for lower courts on how to deal with the growing number of
companies known as ``look-up'' services that take advantage of
computer technology to gather and sell public records to lawyers
and businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Alan F. Westin, a Columbia University political science
professor and publisher of a newsletter called Privacy &AMP; American
Business, said ``look-up'' businesses have proliferated in the last
few years as employers, prompted by concerns ranging from workplace
violence to embezzlement, dig ever deeper into the personal
histories of job applicants.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent survey of 500 large companies, the American
Management Association found that 42 percent check whether job
candidates have criminal convictions.
</P>
<P>
   Representing United Reporting Publishing Corp., Bruce Ennis, a
Washington, D.C. attorney, told the high court that the California
law violated his client's free-speech rights because it made the
same information available to journalists, private investigators
and others but not to United Reporting.
</P>
<P>
   He added that by releasing the records to the press, the law did
nothing to protect the privacy of individuals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having one's name, crime, and address printed in the local
paper is a far greater affront to privacy than receiving a letter
from an attorney, substance-abuse counselor, or driving school,''
Ennis said.
</P>
<P>
   But Thomas Goldstein, a Washington, D.C. lawyer representing the
Los Angeles Police Department, said the statute was needed to
prevent improper use of the arrest records.
</P>
<P>
   ``This country's desire for the free flow of information has
been hijacked by people who only want to use the information to
make money,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Representing the Clinton administration, Justice Department
lawyer Edward DuMont argued that the arrest records should not
become a ``commodity that can be bought and sold.''
</P>
<P>
   But several justices appeared unconvinced.
</P>
<P>
   ``Information is a commodity for the New York Times and every
other newspaper,'' Justice David Souter said. ``I don't see how
this company's use of the records is any different from a newspaper
writing a story about a person who runs a red light and gets
pinched by the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice Antonin Scalia said: ``Just because newspapers sell a
greater variety of information than this company doesn't mean
they're in a different business.''

PROFESSORS GIVE LOW SCORE TO WEB SITE'S CLASS NOTES  
</HEADLINE>

 By ALISSON CLARK   
 The Gainesville (Fla.) Sun   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GAINESVILLE, Fla. _ University of Florida professor Jonathan
Reiskind has used the Internet to post his lecture notes for years,
so the availability of free online course notes doesn't bother him.
What does bother him about StudentU.com's new notes service is the
potential for misinformation.
</P>
<P>
   StudentU's Web site, www. studentu.com, offers free notes for
classes at 60 major universities, including 57 courses at the
University of Florida ranging from business finance to theater
appreciation. Reiskind said StudentU's notes for his Integrated
Principles of Biology course are less than perfect.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got a variety of misspellings in here of things that
are actual questions on the exam,'' he said. ``The notes are not up
to date _ they seem to be quite behind the time. This won't do
anyone much good.''
</P>
<P>
   The notes are posted by students, most of whom are enrolled in
the classes, who earn $300 a semester. StudentU founder Oran Wolf
said the only qualification necessary to be a notetaker is signing
up for a class that's not already covered on the site. For the
first few weeks, Wolf's seven quality-control readers scan the
notes, but without attending the classes themselves, they can't
guarantee that the notes are accurate or complete.
</P>
<P>
   ``We make sure they enter the notes on time and that they look
complete, but we don't know the actual content,'' Wolf said. ``We
can look and see pages of beautiful notes, but for all we know,
it's only 50 percent of the lecture.''
</P>
<P>
   To deal with the problem, Wolf has started a rating system that
allows students to score the notes _ five stars for ``outstanding''
to half a star for ``flush 'em.'' If students are unreliable or
take shoddy notes, Wolf gives them a pep talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like firing people,'' he said. ``I'll talk to them
about the quality of the notes or give them a few notetaking
techniques, then give them another week and see if the quality
improves.''
</P>
<P>
   While he's concerned about accuracy, Wolf said StudentU's notes
are not intended as a substitute for attending lectures.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a student, I would recommend going to class on your own and
using our notes as a supplement,'' he said. ``You can't go in and
just read the notes and think you're going to get a good background
in organic chemistry. Students are smarter than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Reiskind's experience supports Wolf's theory. He said that in
the three years he has posted notes online, attendance hasn't
changed. ``I've thought about not posting the notes, but I don't
think that will make them come to class more regularly,'' Reiskind
said.
</P>
<P>
   History professor Geoffrey Giles, whose History of the Holocaust
lectures are summarized at StudentU.com, said the threat posed by
StudentU's notes goes beyond attendance.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the important lessons we teach is how to distill
information,'' he said. ``That's precisely the information that
they're going to need in careers later on. I think it does a real
disservice to our students that they should be able to get notes
like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Giles shares Reiskind's concerns about inaccuracy. Take this
passage from the anonymous notetaker's summary of Giles' lecture on
the Krakow Ghetto, with spelling and grammatical errors intact:
</P>
<P>
   ``A family of five was living in an 8ft by 10 Ft with one
kitchen and one bathroon. A great deal of smuggling took place in
the ghettos. It was used to find food (kids came in and out). It
was also dangerous and people did try to go in and out even though
they were not allowed ... The Nazis were fooled by the physical
apperance of the Jews. If the Nazi's suspected that you were
missing, the results were devestated for the family. Part of the
family could be tortured or held hostage.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm absolutely appalled,'' Giles said. ``It's absolutely
wretched. It's written by someone who is virtually illiterate and
who's obviously going to have trouble passing the class.''
</P>
<P>
   Giles fears the garbled notes will have an impact on some
students' performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The danger here is that undergraduates have the tendency to
assume that if something's on the printed page, it's true,'' he
said. ``Having these notes on the Internet like this, especially
having it for free, lends a kind of authority to it that it doesn't
deserve.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolf's solution? ``I have a lot of professors who send me their
notes directly,'' he said. ``That way they know they're accurate.''

   No thanks, said Giles. ``My whole stand on this is that it's
inappropriate,'' he said.

   Graduate teaching assistant Kristen Conway posts her notes for
World Geography on the department's Web site. But, like Reiskind,
she leaves out some information that students can only get in
class. Even if the StudentU notes include the omitted information,
students who don't attend class miss key slides, photos and maps.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am concerned that students won't come to class if they think
they can just wait and do this when it's convenient for them,'' she
said. ``It's nice if it is used as a supplement, but I think
students have too much of a tendency to use it as more than that.
This is not a distance-learning class.''

   TREATY _ WASHINGTON _ The nuclear test ban treaty is headed for
a Senate defeat late Wednesday unless President Clinton and his
Democratic allies can craft an agreement to postpone the vote.
(Deans, Cox News Service). 30.

<P>
   w/TREATY-IMPACT _ WASHINGTON _ Will U.S. rejection of the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty make the world a more dangerous
place? The answer depends on how you view the world. In the debate
leading up to the vote, some senators argued that past treaties had
reduced the nuclear threat from the Soviet Union and its allies,
while others claim that the CTBT and similar arms pacts are
worthless, or may actually put Americans in greater peril. (Deans,

went into anaphylactic shock. Jesse and others, like the National

Ku Klux Klan a terrorist group and condemned other hate groups as
well in a resolution approved after an emotional debate. Mark
Potok, a spokesman for the Southern Poverty Law Center in
Montgomery, Ala., said this may be the first municipality to
designate the Klan a terrorist group. The resolution only expresses
the opinion of council and doesn't create law, city attorneys said.

everything we own'' to purchase an 1860s farmhouse on 40 acres, and

rains they might as well as be a million miles from civilization.
Mexico has been overwhelmed by this disaster, and rescuers still
cannot reach isolated hamlets stranded by mudslides and swollen
rivers. When aid does arrive in some rural areas it sometimes
consists of things that are not really needed, angry officials
complained at a meeting here Tuesday night. Even in a city like
this one _ difficult to reach because of mudslides _ poor people
who were evacuated from their homes feel forgotten. (Ferriss,

   ``When Christ Comes''
</P>
<P>
   By Max Lucado
</P>
<P>
   Word, $21.99
</P>
<P>
   About the only rapture in ``When Christ Comes'' is in Max
Lucado's voice.
</P>
<P>
   That is, unlike a lot of those writing about the end of the
world, Lucado isn't discussing theories about the Antichrist, the
millennium or the idea that believers will be snatched away _ aka
the Rapture _ before (or maybe during) the great tribulation. He is
discussing why Christians should not be indulging discomfort,
denial, disappointment or panic when it comes to the Second Coming.
</P>
<P>
   Lucado sees Judgment Day as a time of reunion, rejuvenation and
rewards for believers. But for many people, it will be a day of
tragic reckoning: ``Can we scissor (hell) out of our Bibles? Only
at the expense of a just God and a reliable Bible. Hell is a very
real part of the economy of heaven.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When Christ Comes'' is a sweet-tempered and relatively short
study of a topic whose darker and more complex side sometimes seems
to dominate the discussion. ``Could you use some comforting words
regarding the return of Christ?'' Lucado asks. The San Antonio
author does provide some.

   ``The Slow Way Back''
</P>
<P>
   By Judy Goldman
</P>
<P>
   William Morrow &AMP; Co., $24
</P>
<P>
   This novel is not about faith, but rather ethnicity and
identity. A Southern Jewish woman, uncomfortable with her religious
heritage, seems happily married to a non-Jew. But her psyche rages
with nagging issues. Why doesn't she embrace the legacy of her
forefathers? Why is she impatient rather than passionate toward
Judaism? Why is she exasperated when people allude to Jewish
practices, assuming her familiarity rather than her indifference?
Why does she suffer the same headaches, emanating from the right
side of her face, as her mother did? The discovery of eight
handwritten letters, scrawled a generation earlier in
hard-to-decipher Yiddish, leads to clues that help piece together a
troubled family history.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Slow Way Back'' is a compelling novel interlaced with
Southern idioms and Yiddish rhythms. The writer, a National Public
Radio commentator in Charlotte, N.C., tells a story of Jewish
immigration and assimilation into the life of the South. She
borrows from life to enhance her art. The protagonist is a radio
commentator, a psychologist akin to Dr. Laura, a glib expert who
analyzes listeners' problems in split seconds. Simultaneously, the
radio star ponders her own dilemmas, unresolved issues that have
lingered from generation to generation.

   ``Who I Was Supposed to Be: Stories''
</P>
<P>
   by Susan Perabo
</P>
<P>
   Short fiction
</P>
<P>
   Simon &AMP; Schuster, $20
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't deserve this life,'' a mother says, lamenting the role
she's been forced into by her daughter's desultory love life. That
sentiment _ what could have been, what should have been, what yet
might be _ resonates in much of ``Who I Was Supposed to Be:
Stories,'' a quirky and engaging collection by Susan Perabo.
</P>
<P>
   There are well-drawn portraits here of men and women longing to
relive the past or trying to invigorate their humdrum lives.
</P>
<P>
   The stories' real strength, however, is their twists, many of
which catch the reader completely off-guard _ a retired shop owner
who turns to a new kind of business, a divorced man who finds an
unusual way of spending time with his ex-wife, an unhappy woman who
visits her hometown and unexpectedly benefits from her mother's
addiction to lottery tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Perabo displays great range in tone and voice, and she tackles a
variety of subjects, ridiculous and serious. Throughout, Perabo
maintains a light touch. An often ironic humor suffuses each tale,
either in the main focus or in the details.
</P>
<P>
   In one case, Perabo approaches the same basic theme from
opposite directions. The absurdity of ``Explaining Death to the
Dog,'' for example, in which the narrator tries to do just that, is
balanced by the devastation of the child who narrates ``Gravity,''
which opens with, ``It rained the morning of the day we killed
Dennis Zeller.'' Both stories examine the aftermath of death, but
in strikingly different ways.
</P>
<P>
   More lighthearted is the aptly titled ``Thick as Thieves,'' a
largely typical narrative of a rich-but-aging man with a faltering
Hollywood career and a failing marriage. He has ``only one
worthwhile story to tell,'' about his father, whom he never knew
well, having left home as a teen-ager. His father comes for a
visit, and the two men get to know each other. Into this tired
scenario Perabo injects an oddity that lifts the tale well clear of
cliche.
</P>
<P>
   In the middle of the collection comes the only tale with a
fantastic setting and characters, although it's still cast in a
realistic style. ``Retirement'' is told in the third person, from
the perspective of Alfred, butler to Bruce Wayne, aka Batman. The
opening sentence, ``Alfred was out of Pepto-Bismol,'' is the first
clue to how funny and earthy this well-paced story is.
</P>
<P>
   Even the stories that strike false notes are worth reading for
their quirks, sometimes even their settings. In ``The Rocks Over
Kyburz,'' for example, a father who longs for simpler days finds
that his sons are growing up faster than he thought. It's
well-executed up to a point _ the point, long before the final
page, at which the reader guesses what's going on even while the
father exhibits a naivete that's hard to believe.
</P>
<P>
   The ending of ``Measure of Devotion'' also disappoints, but
because it's too pat. The story does gain, however, from its
background action, a tour of the battlefields at Gettysburg.
</P>
<P>
   Even where Perabo achieves her overall aim, smaller problems mar
the effort. ``Counting the Ways,'' for example, is certainly
bizarre enough to hold the reader's interest, using a dress once
owned by Princess Diana to reveal the fault lines in a married
couple's relationship.
</P>
<P>
   However, some of the symbolism is heavy-handed, the psychology
murky (''The magic of the dress had finally worn off, and she had
tunneled back to that place inside her, the place with no name and
no address and no closing time.'') In a first-person narrative,
instances of the second person (''You're probably thinking I kissed
it or something, but I didn't.'') come out of nowhere and quickly
vanish, their purpose, if any, unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Those flaws don't significantly detract from the overall quality
of the stories, however, and the result is amusing and thoughtful
fare.

PROGRAMS THAT CAN REDECORATE YOUR COMPUTER SCREEN
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By JOE HUTSKO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Look into the reflection on your darkened computer monitor _ the
face staring back could be lifted, tweaked, tightened, uncreased or
flat-out overhauled, with the help (and high cost) of cosmetic
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Flick on the monitor, and what you're facing, your computer's
user interface, can also be nipped and tucked with a virtual face
lift. Find those plain gray windows tiresome? Then paint on a coat
of rusted metal. Envy that futuristic (albeit make-believe) Web
browser in the movie thriller ``The Net''? Now you can download
something like it, complete with shiny 3-D edges and voice
feedback.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike real cosmetic surgery, these changes, minor or major, run
little risk of permanent damage and can be undone with the click of
the mouse. Performing an interface face lift on your own computer
is a virtually painless procedure and, unlike real surgery, costs
little or no money.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the user interface enhancement programs _ available for
both Mac and Windows computers _ are referred to as ``themes'' and
``skins'' (or ``skinz''). Themes change the appearance of your
entire desktop, from the icons and the cursor to the wallpaper and
screen saver.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these custom file sets can be found already loaded on
your computer; others can be downloaded from the Web as trial
versions, which let you try out a pretty new interface before
paying a low shareware fee for the complete, registered version.
Skins are a more limited form of customization. They often dress up
a single program, like an MP3 player or a browser.
</P>
<P>
   Themes and skins are contributed by artistic computer users and
designers. Many of the contributors earn reputations on the various
themes and skins sites, building a sort of cult following with
downloading counts that run into many thousands.
</P>
<P>
   But before putting your computer under the virtual knife, it's a
good idea to get acquainted with the interface makeup kit built
into your computer. Beginning with Macintosh OS 8.5, Apple tucked a
program called Appearance Manager into the Control Panels folder.
With it, you can easily get a new look _ from sleek platinum to the
spring's-in-the-air golden poppy, with an orange flower in full
desktop bloom.
</P>
<P>
   Besides changing the desktop background and highlight colors
(which appear when selecting text or icons), users may also choose
different fonts, font sizes and sound effects. While sound effects
may seem annoying at first, they become familiar and welcome,
providing a subtle audible feedback when clicking or dragging
icons, pressing the Web browser's Back button, opening and closing
windows and opening programs. Anyone who ever doubted the firmness
of a double-click on a program, only to do it again and run the
program a second time, will appreciate sound effect feedback.
</P>
<P>
   On the PC front, Microsoft's Windows 95 and 98 offer various
``scheme'' selections in the Control Panel under Display
Properties. Choices include predefined, color-coordinated schemes
that transform the usual plain-gray appearance to colorful
combinations with names like eggplant, slate and lilac. Windows 98
also includes a glitzy program called Themes, also hidden away in
the Control Panel.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond colors and fonts, Themes changes the desktop wallpaper
and icons, screen saver and sounds. The Baseball theme, for
instance, pastes onto the desktop a batter with a catcher and an
umpire at the ready, changes the My Computer icon to a home plate
and the Recycle Bin to an arena (a pennant indicates that there is
trash to be emptied) and replaces the boring old hourglass ``wait''
cursor with a baseball bat that ticks off the seconds with animated
swings.
</P>
<P>
   Other themes include Travel, with a vintage train station on the
desktop; Jungle, complete with drum and animal sound effects, and a
theme celebrating the work of Leonardo da Vinci.
</P>
<P>
   A boatload of themes celebrating such cult favorites as ``The
X-Files,'' Pokemon and the Dallas Cowboys are available for
downloading at various Web sites, including Winfiles.com
(www.winfiles.com) from CNet, Dream Theme
(www.mountvalley.com/dreamtheme) and Tucows Free Themes
(freethemes.eunet.fi). The sites organize themes by categories like
Animals, Cartoons, Movies, Nature and Sports. Microsoft's Windows
Update Web site also offers Windows 98 Themes
(windowsupdate.microsoft.com).
</P>
<P>
   While Mac and PC Control Panel programs change the overall look
of the desktop, they do not modify the windows' underlying
architecture: familiar details like where a window's title and
close box appear, and how the scrollbar looks. Changing those
aspects calls for a separate interface-enhancement program that
burrows a bit deeper beneath the window's top-layer skin, modifying
the way window frames are drawn on the screen.
</P>
<P>
   Mac users appear to have the advantage when it comes to options
for better-looking windows. The top tool for tweaking the Mac user
interface is Kaleidoscope, a shareware program that can be
downloaded and used for a trial period; it costs $25 to register
(www.kaleidoscope.net).
</P>
<P>
   The site features hundreds of downloadable themes, including the
sparkling, gilded String of Stars and the distressed-metal,
post-industrial Boilerplate. There is also the remarkably
tactile-looking Notepaper, which turns the Mac desktop into an
architect's worktable, right down to papery, torn-edge windows and
superbly pencil-smudged lettering for icons and window titles. The
site also features seasonal themes for holidays like Valentine's
Day and Christmas, holly berries and all.
</P>
<P>
   Another choice for Mac users is DSG Themes, free for downloading
from the DS Group (www.dsgroupinc.com). The company is also working
on a Windows version.
</P>
<P>
   A popular Windows interface enhancement program is
Window-blinds, by Stardock (www.stardock.com). This shareware
program is fully functional, and principled users who take a real
shine to it can register for $19.95. The site offers hundreds of
downloadable skins that, like Kaleidoscope's, range in style from
sleek and smooth to giddy and glittery.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

</ANNOTATION>

</P>
<P>
   Besides the customizing programs, there are add-on programs that
enhance only the computer's Web browser without altering the rest
of the user interface. The front-runner is Neoplanet
(www.neoplanet.com), which layers itself on top of Internet
Explorer's ordinary look with shiny, extraordinarily rendered
metallic-looking buttons and a female voice that welcomes users
aboard every time the program is opened. The site offers a large
gallery of additional Neoplanet themes, like ones simulating the
texture of wood grain or titanium. A single click downloads and
installs the theme. The latest version of Neoplanet's browser also
includes a chat program, for sending instant messages to other
Neoplanet users.
</P>
<P>
   Parents who want to enliven younger users' Web experiences while
cleverly blocking them from the Net's pornography can download the
child-friendly Surf Monkey helpers (www.surfmonkey.com). Animated
with the Surf Monkey character, which looks like a ``Jetsons''
version of Curious George, the Surf Monkey Bar binds itself to
Internet Explorer and offers controls for adjusting where children
can go on the Net.
</P>
<P>
   The Surf Monkey Browser one-ups the bar by completely
transforming Internet Explorer into a candy-colored window on the
Web, complete with the monkey's own home page and virtual gadgets
with sound effects that let kids squirt green slime on Web pages or
shatter the page with bolts of animated lightning that create
make-believe cracks.
</P>
<P>
   While the maker suggests that Surf Monkey is designed for ``kids
ages 6 and up,'' the slime and shatter features may also be brought
into play by news-surfing grown-ups who wish to protest a rival
baseball team's late-breaking victory or just another piece of
spam.

HOW PARENTS WHO HAVE USED DRUGS SHOULD HANDLE KIDS' QUESTIONS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JESSIE MILLIGAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Your 15-year-old looks you in the eye and asks you to tell the
truth: Did you ever do drugs when you were a kid?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is easy, of course, if you never experimented with
drugs. It's tougher if you did try drugs 20 to 30 years ago, and
long ago learned that they weren't for you. The question recently
came into the news when GOP presidential front-runner George W.
Bush said baby boomers should tell their children that, ``I am not
going to talk to you about mistakes I may or may not have made, but
I have some wisdom to share with you.''
</P>
<P>
   Some parents may choose to be more forthcoming, however. If so,
they should put some thought into how they will answer the
question.
</P>
<P>
   Here, five things to consider when your children ask about your
past.
1. Consider your child's maturity level.
</P>
<P>
   It's OK to evade a question about drugs if a child is so young
he or she wouldn't really understand the answer. A 6-year-old
doesn't really need to know. Tell them that you'll talk about it
when they are older.
2. When they are old enough to hear, don't lie to them.
</P>
<P>
   Many federal agencies and national nonprofits, such as the Safe
and Drug Free Schools Program of the U.S. Department of Education,
say that if a child asks about past drug use, the best thing to do
is to tell the truth.
</P>
<P>
   Here's why: Kids will see right through an evasive answer, and
they'll know if you are trying to wiggle out of an uncomfortable
situation. If your child someday tries drugs, you want him or her
to come forward and be honest with you.
</P>
<P>
   And a child may someday overhear or be told about some of the
mistakes of your youth. If you've lied to them and they discover
the truth, your credibility will be lost.
</P>
<P>
   As well, if a parent is evasive or lies about his or her own
experience, the issue can become larger in the child's mind, says
Carol Anne Darwin, psychotherapist, The Center for Change,
Development and Support in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think kids need realness. It's not enough to know that
`drugs are bad.' They may benefit from hearing your experience,''
says Darwin.
3. So exactly what do you say?
</P>
<P>
   Here's an example, recommended by Alyse Booth of the Center on
Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University, New York:
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I did. It was a mistake I don't want you to make. We know
so much more about the dangers of drugs now, and drugs are stronger
and more addicting than they used to be. That's why our household
policy is `no' on drugs.''
4. Don't give too many details.
</P>
<P>
   Remember the sole purpose of talking honestly to your children
about drugs is to offer them guidance. It isn't necessary to
describe what you did at a Grateful Dead concert in 1973. Adding
too many details may just make drugs seem glamorous or fun.
5. Consider family counseling
</P>
<P>
   Christy Conklin, drug and alcohol counselor at Family Services
of Fort Worth, said parents who feel too uncomfortable with the
subject should consider family counseling to open the lines of
communication.

JUSTICES TO DECIDE AGE-BIAS CASES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ An intensely skeptical Supreme Court on Wednesday
considered whether the Constitution prohibits states from
discriminating against older Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The justices, hearing arguments in a case involving the federal
Age Discrimination in Employment Act, noted that they have never
given older people much constitutional protection. The court has
ruled that the Constitution's Equal Protection Clause requires only
that states have a ``rational basis'' for treating older Americans
differently than their fellow citizens.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the high court has allowed states to impose
mandatory retirement ages on judges, concluding that a state can
rationally conclude that health and judgment decline with age.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the court's record in age-bias cases, an attorney for
Florida and Alabama state workers pressed the justices to give
greater constitutional protection to older employees. Jeremiah
Collins argued that older workers suffer from the same ``invidious
discrimination'' faced by blacks and women, who are
constitutionally protected against discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   Collins was pressing the case of older workers at Florida and
Alabama state universities who claim that because of their age they
were paid less than their younger colleagues. The workers sued the
states.
</P>
<P>
   Federal courts, however, threw out their cases, ruling that the
Constitution protects states from being sued for money damages
unless Congress expressly says that states can be sued.
</P>
<P>
   The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said Congress had not
made clear its intention to override the states' constitutional
immunity from suits. It also said the Constitution does not
prohibit age discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   In his appeal to the Supreme Court, Collins argued that Congress
``unequivocally authorized'' states to be sued under the
anti-age-bias law. In addition, the Washington, D.C., lawyer said
the Constitution's Equal Protection Clause gave Congress the
authority to prohibit states from discriminating against people
based on their age.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing before the Supreme Court, Collins said that Congress
in 1974 amended the age-bias law to make clear that state agencies
are subject to the law's anti-discrimination provisions. He also
said older Americans warrant Constitutional protection because they
are victimized by the same nefarious stereotypes that plague
minorities and women in the workforce.
</P>
<P>
   But Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist apparently was not
convinced, saying that older workers do not face the same
``invidious discrimination'' that blacks often endure at work.
States also could rationally conclude that people start ``going
downhill at a particular age,'' the 75-year-old chief justice said,
adding that ''a lot of us can testify`` to the relationship between
age and decline.
</P>
<P>
   But Deputy Solicitor General Barbara Underwood, pressing the
Clinton administration's support for the employees, said states
have no rational basis to discriminate against older workers. Older
people have just as strong a desire to work as their younger
colleagues, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Antonin Scalia, however, noted that a state could
rationally conclude that it would be better off hiring a younger
worker, who could reasonably be expected to be in the workforce
longer than an older employee.
</P>
<P>
   Scalia also drew a distinction between age discrimination and
bias against minorities and women, saying that age affects
everyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all going to be old,'' Scalia said. ``It's unlike ...
race and sex. Some of us don't have to worry about that (type of
discrimination).''
</P>
<P>
   The justices are expected to render their decision in the case
by July.

``Superintendents are)  
 (ATTN: Calif., Ill., Ore., Tenn., Texas, Wash.)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JULIAN GUTHRIE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Although women make up nearly 80 percent of the
nation's teachers, they account for just 10 percent of the
superintendents leading public school systems, virtually the same
percentage as at the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
   The glass ceiling between women and the top job in school
systems is proving one of the most difficult to shatter. In
corporate America, women account for 46 percent of the work force
and hold 40 percent of top management jobs. In the female-dominated
field of education, women hold 35 percent of all management jobs,
from superintendent down to school principal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Society still wants women _ the teachers _ to take care of
children, nurture them and make sure they're safe,'' said C. Cryss
Brunner, a University of Wisconsin professor and author of two
books exploring the role of women superintendents. ``Men are there
to be top administrators who step in and oversee the `school
families.'''
</P>
<P>
   According to the Urban Superintendents Program at Harvard
University, women comprised 10 percent of superintendents at the
dawn of 1900; their ranks dropped to a mere 1 percent during the
1920s, rose to 3 percent in 1990, and have reached 10 percent on
the eve of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   For educators such as Lonnie K. Chin, principal at Spring Valley
Elementary School in San Francisco, the bias is far more personal,
and can change a career.
</P>
<P>
   Chin said she once thought of becoming a district
superintendent. She was even recruited into Urban Superintendents
Program. But after seeing the national trend and frankly assessing
her management style, she decided she is happy being a principal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Superintendents are supposed to charge all over like the Lone
Ranger. My style is more collaborative and cooperative. That's
something that's seen as less decisive,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the superintendents these school districts have hired:
</P>
<P>
   _ Seattle picked retired Army Maj. Gen. John Stanford in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   _ Chicago recently chose former city Budget Director Paul
Vallas.
</P>
<P>
   _ The school board in San Diego this year hired Alan Bersin, a
former U.S. attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Women who have cracked the top job often encounter reactions
they never imagined.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was Chicago's superintendent in the early '80s, I had
reporters asking me who I was dating,'' recalled Ruth Love, a
former superintendent in Oakland, Calif., and in Chicago. ``They
wrote about what I wore or (about) my hair style. There was this
expectation that I, as a woman, would wither up under criticism or
just say, `I'm getting out of here.'''
</P>
<P>
   Yvonne Katz, the first woman to head school districts in
Beaverton, Ore., and San Antonio, had similar experiences.
</P>
<P>
   Now overseeing Beaverton's 32,000 public school children, she
said she hopes younger women will not have to struggle as hard to
be taken seriously.
</P>
<P>
   In schools, just as in business, there are myriad reasons women
have not advanced to the superintendent's office. Some women
teachers put their careers on hold to raise families. Some search
firms aggressively push male candidates for top jobs. But educators
say perhaps the most critical reason is the perception of what type
of personality it takes to manage teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of superintendents who came up through the ranks
were high school principals. And ``in education, people believe
it's OK for women to be elementary school principals, but at high
school and beyond, a man is needed to maintain order and rally the
troops,'' said N. Gerry House, the female superintendent in
Memphis, Tenn., one of the 20 largest districts in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, women account for 35 percent of elementary school
principals and 17 percent of high school principals.
</P>
<P>
   Delaine Eastin, California's first female superintendent of
public instruction, predicts the glass ceiling will break only
after women fill more high school principal jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``At one point, 85 percent of teachers were women and 85 percent
of principals were men. Now, as more women become principals, more
will become superintendents.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Not having more women among the ranks of superintendents is
hurting schools, some educators say.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we're looking for leadership in education _ and we are
desperate for strong leaders _ we're eliminating some of our best
candidates,'' said Bob Peterkin, director of Harvard's Urban
Superintendents Program, founded in 1990 to encourage women and
minorities to become superintendents.
</P>
<P>
   San Jose Unified Superintendent Linda Murray said women are
well-suited for the job because: ``It's the women who have an
understanding of what teaching and learning is about. ... You'd
hope that expertise would come through at the highest levels of
leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   For House, the most compelling reason is this: ``In all of our
teaching, we tell kids they can be whatever they want in life and
that gender should not be a discriminating factor. If we aren't
conscious of practicing gender equity, we become a mockery of what
we teach.''

<P>
   First, the Metro bus company had to get its operators past the
notion that you can't turn the bus around, that it's just not done.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen years of budget cuts and downsizing had traumatized the
largely unionized work force. And years of less-than-amiable
negotiations had created a rift between supervisors and drivers.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1996 a breakthrough contract agreement allowed the
authority to work more efficiently by using part-time drivers and
smaller buses where routes called for them. Federal funding also
has stabilized in the last couple of years, and the ridership
decline leveled off.
</P>
<P>
   ``We finally got to the point where we had a mutual appreciation
of our serious problems,'' said Dick Davis, ATA general manager.
</P>
<P>
   After the financial emergencies were handled, though, some
workplace relationships remained troubled.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ATA unfortunately had become too oriented to dealing with
the problem operator,'' Davis said. ``We'd become a disciplinarian.
We needed to move more to a culture that spent a lot more time
supporting and recognizing the good ones.''
</P>
<P>
   The authority found what most organizations have learned in the
1990s: Workers want to be included in the thought process. They
want to be asked for their suggestions. They want to share their
experiences from the front line. They don't want to just take
orders.
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing that evolution, the ATA board authorized a
consulting contract. Jerry Haney was hired to work with a ``culture
change team'' of supervisors and union members, people handpicked
to lead the transformation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked for respected employees who were thinkers or natural
leaders, not just yes men or complainers,'' said Fern Koehler, ATA
deputy general manager. ``We've held long meetings and training
sessions. We wanted to agree on values, react to each other's
concerns and treat each other with respect.''
</P>
<P>
   They're working on such issues as conflict management, rudeness
and personal safety. A major goal is to have a work force that
works well without supervision, that makes the ``right'' decision
because it's the right thing to do based on the circumstance _ not
because a company rule or schedule says so.
</P>
<P>
   My limited recent experiences riding ATA buses indicates that
the goal isn't universally met yet. It will take time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying for open, two-way communication, not
order-giving,'' Davis said. ``When we opened one of our first
change meetings to questions and comments, we got remarkable
feedback. We heard customer and employee issues that had never been
raised in union talks.''
</P>
<P>
   It's an amazing thing when organizations finally get to a place
of mutual respect and common purpose. Everybody at the ATA isn't
there yet, but the organization is en route. Let's see when and if
riders appreciate the change.

<P>
   The New York Times's computer football ranking is based on an
analysis of each team's scores with emphasis on three factors: who
won, by what margin and against what quality of opposition. The
quality of an opponent is determined by examining its record
against other teams.
</P>
<P>
   The Times's computer model collapses runaway scores and takes
note of a home-field advantage. Recent games count more than
earlier games.
</P>
<P>
   The top team is assigned a rating of 1.000; the ratings of all
other teams are percentages reflecting their strength relative to
the top team. This week, for example, there is a fairly large
difference between St. Louis (no. 1) and Jacksonville (no. 2), and
a much smaller difference between Jacksonville (no. 2) and
Indianapolis (no. 3).

CANADIAN JOURNALIST SAYS MALAYSIAN JUDICIARY IS FLAWED 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By MARK LANDLER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ Murray Hiebert finished his assignment as a foreign
correspondent in Malaysia last week on a jarring note: stripped to
the waist and sitting on a bare floor as a prison guard called the
roll.
</P>
<P>
   Hiebert, a Canadian reporter for The Far Eastern Economic
Review, was released from a prison near Kuala Lumpur on Monday
after serving four weeks for contempt of court for an article he
wrote in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Hiebert, who was released two weeks early for good behavior,
left Malaysia on Tuesday for the first time in more than two years.
Wednesday, as he made the rounds at the Hong Kong headquarters of
his magazine, he was savoring the small things, like the panoramic
view of Victoria Harbor from the Review's offices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sorry if I seem distracted,'' Hiebert said with a wry smile.
``I haven't seen views like this for a little while.''
</P>
<P>
   His home for the last month was a windowless room he shared with
35 other inmates. Given the high profile of his case, Hiebert said
he believed that he had been treated better than a typical
Malaysian prisoner. He slept on a cot with a thin mattress rather
than on a concrete floor, as is customary for new arrivals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was treated as well as the prison rules would allow,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty days in prison is not a draconian penalty by Malaysian
standards. Anwar Ibrahim, the former deputy prime minister and
rival of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, was sentenced to six
years on corruption charges that his defenders insist are
politically motivated.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the experience has shaken Hiebert, 50, a soft-spoken man
known among his colleagues for his ascetic way of life and
unflappable demeanor. And it could have lingering impact in a
country where critics say the government uses the courts as a club
to bully news organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lost my freedom, which is a rather shocking thing to have
happen, for writing about a debating team,'' Hiebert said. ``I
wasn't Bob Woodward trying to bring down a presidency.''
</P>
<P>
   The trouble started in January 1997, after Hiebert wrote about
the wife of a prominent judge who sued the Kuala Lumpur
International School when her 17-year-old son was dropped from the
debating team.
</P>
<P>
   Hiebert suggested that the case moved through the legal system
unusually quickly because the boy's father was a judge. He quoted
an unnamed Malaysian lawyer as saying such cases normally took at
least five years to reach a court. The court heard this one just
seven months after it was filed.
</P>
<P>
   The judge's wife, Chandra Sri Ram, agreed to a settlement of her
case. But in an affidavit, she accused Hiebert of contempt of
court. A judge agreed, finding Hiebert guilty of ``scandalizing the
judiciary.''
</P>
<P>
   In imposing a three-month prison sentence, Judge Low Hop Bing
wrote, ``In my view, for far too long there appears to be unabated
contemptuous attacks by and through the media on our judiciary.''
</P>
<P>
   Hiebert is appealing the verdict. But last month he decided to
serve a reduced sentence rather than seek a delay, because he
wanted to retrieve his passport. The government was holding it
while the case was pending, preventing him from leaving the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Hiebert's case was complicated by the fact that shortly before
the article appeared, his wife had been named deputy headmistress
of the school. Even Hiebert's friends acknowledge that this was a
potential conflict of interest. Hiebert declined to discuss the
issue, citing his appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the anguish it caused him, Hiebert said he had no
regrets about the article. He said it had been vindicated by
events.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made some critical comments about the judiciary, and I stand
by them,'' he said. ``Most of what I said in that article has been
shown over and over again in all the various cases we've seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Malaysia was galvanized earlier this year by the trial
of Anwar, the protege-turned-rival of Mahathir. Soon after Anwar
was dismissed by the prime minister, he was charged with corruption
and sex-related crimes.
</P>
<P>
   After a trial marked by questionable rulings, Anwar was found
guilty and sentenced to six years. He is now fighting sodomy
charges.
</P>
<P>
   Anwar's defenders say it was a convenient way to dispose of
Mahathir's most potent political rival.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a judiciary that is at the beck and call of the
executive,'' said Chandra Muzaffar, an academic who is helping
Anwar's wife, Azizah Ismail, mount a challenge to Mahathir.
</P>
<P>
   In an odd twist, Hiebert was sent to the same prison where Anwar
is serving his sentence. As he leaves Malaysia's roiling political
drama for a new job as Washington correspondent of the Review, one
might expect Hiebert to express bitterness about his experience.
But he is remarkably generous about the country that turned him
into a legal precedent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lovely country,'' he said. ``The people are very
friendly. My problem isn't with the 22 million people who occupy
most of the country. My problem is with the judiciary.''

LEFFE ABBEY ALE _ PROOF THAT BLONDES DO HAVE MORE FUN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN MELTON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Regular readers of The Beer Nut may be tired of my infatuation
with Belgian brews, and I'm truly sorry if I sound like a broken
record about how wonderful they are. So here's my advice: Get over
it. Or get your own column.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, indulge me, please, as I sing the praises of
yet another masterful Belgian Abbey-style Ale: Leffe (LEF-fay)
Blonde.
</P>
<P>
   Brewed, not coincidentally, in the tiny town of Leffe, Blonde
hits the tongue with a tart, fruity sharpness, but goes down with
the traditional big, bitter and yeasty finish. Indeed, the
murkiness of the brew puts off many first-time tasters, but don't
flee. It's just the yeast that the brew masters add right before
stoppering to condition the beer. And as with most top-fermented
brews, Leffe is best served at the same temperature at which it
comes into the world: roughly between 60 and 68 degrees. In fact,
the change of seasons right now is a perfect time to sit back and
enjoy a Leffe with a big ol' bowl of chili.
</P>
<P>
   But Beer Nut, you ask _ why the passion for Belgians? Allow me
to offer a bit of explanation about my obsession.
</P>
<P>
   It all goes back to how beer is made. Top-fermentation, an
ancient brewing method, allows yeast to rise to the top of the
brewing vessel during naturally occurring fermentation. This yields
stouts, ales, porters and wheat beers, all of which have distinct
fruity notes. In contrast, bottom-fermentation is a relatively new
Bavarian innovation from the 19th century, wherein yeasts stay at
the bottom of the brewing vessel, resulting in lighter,
cleaner-tasting lagers and their subset, even cleaner-tasting
pilsners.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, mass production of beer began with the advent of
bottom-fermentation, because it allowed brewers to do their thing
year-round. With top-fermentation, the yeasts tended to interbreed
with airborne yeasts, rendering brewing impossible during summer
months. Nowadays, with refrigeration and sealed brew kettles, both
methods are used year-round. But bottom-fermentation came out on
top, which is why so many different lagers now hail from all over
the world. Which is a good thing.
</P>
<P>
   But it also brings me back to my infatuation with Belgian beers.
It's a personal thing: After years of swilling lagers, I'm ready
for a change. And no other country in the world offers more
varieties of beers (except possibly Engthan Belgium.
Pilsners, lambics (gueuze, kriek and faro), abbey, white, red,
brown ....
</P>
<P>
   All this wonderfully strong beer to taste, yet so little time.
Truly a dirty job, but hey, somebody's gotta do it. So hey, this
one's for you.

TORY STANCE ON EUROPE TIES IS CRITICIZED BY FORMER PARTY
OFFICIALS 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By WARREN HOGE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ The decision at the Conservative annual convention
distancing the party further from Europe was attacked by past Tory
leaders Wednesday as unthinking and suicidal for the party's
chances of ever getting back into power.
</P>
<P>
   Britain's relationship with Europe is the most divisive issue in
the party that long dominated British politics, and a vexing
internal dispute over it contributed to the Tories' overwhelming
loss to Labor two years ago and to their continued low standing in
opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
   Party leader William Hague declared the hard-line policy at the
party conference in Blackpool last week in an effort to end the
debate, but the action seems instead to have renewed it.
</P>
<P>
   Former Prime Minister John Major called the new stance ``absurd
and crazy.'' Former Prime Minister Edward Heath termed it ``very
sad.'' Former party chairman Chris Patten said the party was
``making no sense'' anymore and risked losing mainstream support.
</P>
<P>
   Former Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd called the party's
deepening skepticism toward the Continent ``frivolous'' and said,
``Judging from last week's speeches in Blackpool, Conservative
policy on Europe is increasingly based on the caricature, not on
the reality.'' The party will cease to be taken seriously, he
added, ``if it's busy throwing abuse at the caricature.''
</P>
<P>
   Patten, who served as the last governor-general of Hong Kong and
is now taking up the job of European external affairs commissioner,
signaled that Hague was mistaken if he thought the party would
unite uncomplainingly behind the tough new attitude. He was
breaking his own pledge of silence, he told The Times of London
from his Brussels office, ``because if the result of keeping quiet
is that things keep on being dragged in a direction which plainly
raises question marks about the national interest, is one still
obliged to take a vow of omerta?
</P>
<P>
   Patten said disenchanted Tories were obliged to take public
issue with the new policy now ``because we're in danger of crossing
a river and it's very difficult to get back from the other side
unless people like me speak out at this moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Heseltine, who was the deputy prime minister in Major's
government, and Kenneth Clarke, who was chancellor of the
Exchequer, assailed the new policy during the Blackpool conference
and will be speaking out against it Thursday when they join Prime
Minister Tony Blair in the launching of a cross-party ``Britain in
Europe'' public education campaign in London.
</P>
<P>
   Blair has staked out a position of establishing a more
cooperative atmosphere between Britain and the rest of Europe while
keeping the country for the present out of the monetary union, the
agreement under which 11 nations are converting their national
money into euros.
</P>
<P>
   Blair is starting to prepare public opinion for entry at a later
date when, he argues, joining the common currency will make more
economic sense for Britain than it does now. He has promised a
public referendum on the decision, and the expectation is that it
will occur soon after the next election, which must take place by
May 2002.
</P>
<P>
   In the two years of Hague's leadership, the Conservatives have
adopted an absolute position that there will be no consideration of
Britain's joining a common currency for seven years at the very
least. They have cast the argument as one of giving up the pound, a
powerful national symbol.
</P>
<P>
   At their conference in Blackpool, they stiffened this position,
suggesting that Britain should renegotiate the founding treaty of
the European Union and saying Britain must not agree to any new
arrangements with continental nations that do not give it
permission to escape requirements it does not like.
</P>
<P>
   A move among hard-liners in the party to take Britain out of the
European Union altogether was given impetus by the rapturous
reception accorded former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who is
known to favor that action. ``In my lifetime, all the problems have
come from mainland Europe,'' she said on arrival in Blackpool in a
much-commented-upon statement, ``and all the solutions have come
from the English-speaking nations across the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Major told The Daily Telegraph on Wednesday that ``to say
nothing good comes out of Europe is just plain silly.'' He said he
feared for Hague and the party's future. ``He is being pushed too
far to the right,'' he said. ``We cannot possibly win an election
from there.''
</P>
<P>
   A hard-line attitude toward Europe has held more allure for the
Conservatives in Parliament who run the party than it has for
Conservative voters. Surveys show that while opposition to
Britain's participation in the European common currency remains
widespread, it has been diluted by the conclusion of a majority of
Britons that the country's eventual entry is inevitable and by
growing fears among businessmen of the bottom-line risks of staying
out.

DISPUTED HOLOCAUST MEMOIR   WITHDRAWN  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Germany, Latvia, Poland, Switzerland, Calif.)   By DOREEN CARVAJAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ For more than a year the publishers of a
slender 155-page memoir of a young Latvian Jewish orphan's early
life of struggle in two concentration camps stood firm against
accusations that the memories of terror were nothing more than
vivid fantasies.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday the German publisher, Suhrkamp Verlag, which had
once vigorously defended the author, Binjamin Wilkomirksi,
announced with expressions of pity that it was withdrawing from
stores all hardcover copies of the book, ``Fragments.'' It was
acting on information in a historian's 100-page confidential report
that had recently been presented to it that concluded that
Wilkomirski had not been a Jewish orphan but a Swiss-born child
named Bruno Doessekker.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement, in which the publisher continued to refer to
the author as Binjamin Wilkomirski, was made in a brief statement
in what amounts to the public square of international publishing,
the annual Frankfurt Book Fair, which draws more than 6,000
exhibitors annually. It is likely that the Suhrkamp announcement
will have a ripple effect since many of the other publishers of the
book around the world had relied on the well-respected German
publisher to vouch for Wilkomirski.
</P>
<P>
   Wilkomirski did not respond to messages left for him at his home
in Switzerland. But two people with knowledge of the report said
that when he was confronted with its findings, he stood up and
declared defiantly, ``I am Binjamin Wilkomirski.''
</P>
<P>
   The frail, reclusive author has been immersed in an
international controversy since a Swiss writer, Daniel Ganzfried,
first raised doubts publicly last year about whether Wilkomirski
was actually Jewish or even old enough to have witnessed the
terrors of two concentration camps in Poland. The author described
watching rats rummaging among the corpses and starving babies
sucking their fingers to the bone.
</P>
<P>
   In translations, the book's simple, searing language has reaped
a number of honors like the National Jewish Book Award in the
United States and the Prix Memoire de la Shoah in France.
Wilkomirski also toured the United States to deliver lectures in
major cities sponsored by the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum.
</P>
<P>
   But as the nagging doubts about his identity increased,
Wilkomirski's Swiss agent, Eva Koralnik, decided to hire a Swiss
historian, Stefan Maechler, to investigate the author's murky past.
Maechler's preliminary report, six months in the making, includes
new information from documents, which indicate that Wilkomirski was
living in Switzerland and never left the country during the war
years, a period when, he has said, he was struggling to survive in
the camps of Majdnek and Auschwitz. A Swiss television station also
reported this week that the historian had tracked down the author's
living natural father.
</P>
<P>
   A final report is still scheduled to be issued, Suhrkamp said,
but there was enough troubling information to prompt the publisher
to pull several hundred hardcover copies in circulation in German
bookstores and to banish the title from the back list of its
Jewish-interest publishing imprint, Juedischer Verlag. Suhrkamp
will continue to sell paperback versions until the final report
comes out sometime in the next three weeks and the company makes
what it says will be its ultimate conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very disappointed to make this decision,'' said Nadine
Meyer, the editor of Juedischer. ``We are sad about it and we feel
sorry about it, but also have a responsiblity as a publisher.''
</P>
<P>
   Heide Grasnick, a spokeswoman for Suhrkamp, said the company did
not condemn Wilkomirksi but rather felt sympathy for the author,
who was raised by his adoptive parents in Switzerland and spent
decades searching for his identity.
</P>
<P>
   While awaiting a response from Wilkomirski, Ms. Grasnick said,
the company decided to move to withdraw books published by
Juedischer because it now seemed inappropriate for a Jewish
publishing imprint to be circulating the book.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a problem,'' Ms. Grasnick said. ``What do you do when you
have an author who maintains that this is his identity and still
believes it and there are these documents?'' She added: ``I feel
pity for him because I know him personally. He's not a happy
person.''
</P>
<P>
   In his book, first published in 1995, Wilkomirski portrayed
himself as an orphaned young Latvian Jew despite Swiss legal
records that indicated that he was born in Biel, Switzerland, in
1941 to an unmarried Swiss woman who was Christian, Yvonne
Grosjean. He was later adopted by middle-class parents, the
Doessekkers.
</P>
<P>
   Publishers said that the report was the result of a rare formal
contract among Wilkomirski; his literary agent, Ms. Koralnik, and
Maechler, who struck an agreement to look at all of Wilkomirski's
documentation. Maechler was given power of attorney to request
private government documents.
</P>
<P>
   As part of that contract, Wilkomirski has the right to review
the report and to respond within the next 20 days, Ms. Grasnick of
Suhrkamp said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Koralnik started sharing the report with the book's various
publishers this week. ``It's the only way we can do this to bring
an end to this matter,'' Ms. Koralnik said of her decision to
commission a report. ``So we decided that we owed something to the
reader, to the publisher and everybody who read the book.''
</P>
<P>
   She declined to describe her own reaction to the report, but
said, `I think that the fact that the book was withdrawn speaks for
itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Carol Janeway, Wilkomirski's American editor and translator for
Schocken Books, an imprint of Alfred A. Knopf, said she had
received a copy of the preliminary report on Tuesday but would
probably not take any action until after reading it. When doubts
about the book were raised, Ms. Janeway defended it last November
as ``remarkable testimony'' and said the publisher was not about to
``vet every manuscript and every author on an adversarial basis.''
</P>
<P>
   Leon Stabinsky, the president of the California Association of
Holocaust Survivors, said that Suhrkamp should have taken this
latest step a long time ago because it had fielded early
allegations from a former Swiss newspaper editor that the book was
a work of fiction.
</P>
<P>
   But the view was far from unanimous even among Holocaust
survivors. Stabinsky formed his own group after splitting off from
the Holocaust Child Survivors Group of Los Angeles, in part because
of feuding over whether the book's author was telling the truth.

WHERE SHOULD SLEEPING BABY LIE? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Wednesday, Oct. 20.)  
(lh) 
 By MARY J. LOFTUS   
 Lakeland (Fla.) Ledger   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The parent and baby co-sleeping debate has risen again, with
valid arguments on both sides of the bed.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts say it's dangerous: the baby might roll between the
mattress and the headboard or wall and smother, or a deep-sleeping
parent might accidentally roll over on the infant and injure him.
Another camp says it's indulgent, and will spoil the child, making
him clingy and unable to sleep alone.
</P>
<P>
   But pro-family bed researchers say it's largely safe, and an
important bonding time.
</P>
<P>
   ``While Western cultures have allowed technology to be
substituted for mother and baby contact, biology is the same as it
was 10,000 years ago,'' says James McKenna, an anthropologist and
mother/baby sleep researcher at the University of Notre Dame.
``Babies still need that contact and comfort.''
</P>
<P>
   McKenna studied 110 pairs of breast-feeding mothers and their
babies 2 months to 5 months old. He find that co-sleeping babies
are placed in safer positions, breast feed more, cry less and sleep
more.
</P>
<P>
   I've studied only two babies _ my own.
</P>
<P>
   And, to be honest, I tried whatever worked. At various times
I've shared a double bed with them; let them cry themselves to
sleep in their crib; rocked them until they fell asleep; and, as
they grew older, let them crawl in bed between my husband and me
after they had nightmares.
</P>
<P>
   Our son slept well in his own crib until he was ill for a few
weeks when he was about a year old. We brought him into our bed and
didn't get him completely out again for the next two years.
</P>
<P>
   To be honest, I loved snuggling with him at night, since I was
working full time and didn't have much body contact with him during
the day.
</P>
<P>
   He grudgingly started sleeping alone in his twin bed at just
over 3, but even now, at 8, he will sometimes ask us to lie down
with him or at least let the cat stay in his room ``so I can sleep
with something warm.''
</P>
<P>
   With my daughter, I set up a bed and cradle in the guestroom so
we could nap together frequently. She gladly nursed next to me
until sated. Then she wiggled restlessly until I placed her in her
bumper-lined cradle.
</P>
<P>
   Just when things had settled into a routine, my son got his bunk
bed, and his sister inherited his twin bed. She was so happy to be
in a ``big girl'' bed, with Winnie-the-Pooh sheets.
</P>
<P>
   She played on the bed, read on the bed, snuggled with us on the
bed. And then, after lights were out, she'd promptly climb out of
bed and wander the house at all hours of the night.
</P>
<P>
   Short of locking her in her dark room (which we actually tried a
few times, to hysterical screaming) we had to battle each night to
make her stay in bed.
</P>
<P>
   In short order, we were back to a family bed again.
</P>
<P>
   Through trial and error over the years, we have tried to
maximize sleep time while recognizing that we don't rule out
co-sleeping in the first few years. Now that my children are 3 and
8, they sleep alone most nights unless they are sick or have a bad
dream ... about once a month for each.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are very few purists'' when it comes to family sleeping
arrangements, says McKenna. ``Parents try about everything.''

`NYPD BLUE' TO LOSE ITS TIME SLOT ON ABC, PRODUCER SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By BERNARD WEINRAUB    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ Steven Bochco, co-creator of the Emmy-award winning
television series ``NYPD Blue,'' said Wednesday that ABC had told
him the show would be moved from its Tuesday night time slot after
six years. The network declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   An angry Bochco said that Stuart Bloomberg, co-chairman of ABC
Entertainment Group, told him Wednesday morning that the network
was considering replacing the show with ``Once and Again,'' a
series about two single parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know where we're going; they won't tell us,'' Bochco
said. ``Basically they're kissing us off. If you look at the
schedule, there's no place that makes any sense at all.'' He added:
``It's disrespectful, it's disloyal. I told them that if you want
to shoot yourself in the foot, be my guest. Except my foot's under
your foot.''
</P>
<P>
   Although ABC declined to comment officially, executives there
said that no final decision had been made. ``NYPD Blue'' was ranked
13th last year among regular series for viewers 18 to 49. The
audience for the police drama dropped 7 percent last year from the
previous year, a normal rate of attrition for a popular show that
has been on the air for years.
</P>
<P>
   Bochco said Bloomberg told him that ``Once and Again'' was being
considered for the time slot because of its appeal to women. That
show, created by Edward Zwick and Marshall Herskovitz, is in the
``NYPD Blue'' time slot at 10 p.m. Eastern time on Tuesdays. It was
scheduled to go off the air when ``NYPD Blue'' returned on Nov. 9
and come back later in another time slot.
</P>
<P>
   But according to Bochco, Bloomberg told him that if ``Once and
Again'' were removed, its substantial number of women viewers would
turn to a rival show on CBS, ``Judging Amy,'' and turn it into a
hit. ``They're doing this to us in order to prevent that possible
scenario,'' Bochco said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once and Again,'' which began showing in September, is the
highest-rated new drama on any network among viewers 18 to 49.
</P>
<P>
   Bochco, the creator or co-creator of shows like ``L.A. Law'' and
``Hill Street Blues,'' said he was convinced that one reason his
show was being shifted was that Walt Disney Co., which produces
``Once and Again'' and owns ABC, was protecting its investment.
``NYPD Blue'' is produced by Bochco's company, Steven Bochco
Productions, and distributed by 20th Century Fox television, a
division of News Corp.

SWISS INVESTIGATE RUSSIAN BUSINESSMAN FOR POSSIBLE BANK FRAUD 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By NEELA BANERJEE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ The police in Switzerland have said investigations into
possible money laundering and crimes by Russian executives and
politicians have expanded to include Lev Cherny, a Russian emigrant
businessman with extensive interests in the metals industry.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Swiss Federal Office of Police Matters,
Juerg Pulver, confirmed a report in the weekly Sonntagsblick that
an inquiry had started.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of Cherny have denied his involvement in
wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Swiss law-enforcement agencies have for several months been
looking into major cases involving Swiss organizations doing
business in Russia or Russian companies with accounts in
Switzerland. One prominent investigation involves reported
kickbacks from the Mabetex Group of Lugano, the global engineering
and construction company, to officials in President Boris N.
Yeltsin's administration in exchange for contracts here.
</P>
<P>
   Another inquiry focuses on Swiss companies that may be tied to a
Russian financier, Boris Berezovsky.
</P>
<P>
   Cherny made a name for himself years ago through his involvement
with a metals trading company, the Trans-World Group, which gained
control of the vast smelters at the heart of the Russian aluminum
industry. Trans-World has repeatedly denied that Cherny is involved
in running the company, which has offices in London, Geneva and
elsewhere. But past discussions with Trans-World executives have
shown that Cherny had a role in establishing relations between the
company, once a small-time player in the metals market, and Russian
smelters.
</P>
<P>
   Those relationships helped increase Trans-World sales, generated
the income that the company needed to buy major stakes in the
smelters during the privatization of large factories, and made
Trans-World into a leading aluminum producer.
</P>
<P>
   Since the mid-1990s, investigators with the Interior Ministry
have been looking into whether Cherny and his two brothers were
part of a sweeping bank fraud that the police say the Chernys used
to finance their first deals with the smelters.
</P>
<P>
   In written testimony at a May 1995 parliamentary hearing, a
senior investigator with the Interior Ministry, Sergei Glushenkov,
said preliminary investigations showed that foreign companies ``set
up by a group of former citizens of the Soviet Union led by the
brothers Cherny'' signed contracts with aluminum plants. ``Payment
by the above-mentioned foreign firms for the majority of these
contracts,'' Glushenkov wrote, ``was made through fictitious
companies that used resources obtained as a result of fraudulent
operations with bank documents.''
</P>
<P>
   Trans-World and Cherny's lawyers have said that if the company's
name did arise in connection with bank fraud, that was because
Trans-World had fallen victim to shady companies during the chaos
of the early days of market reforms.

   LOS ANGELES -- The prospect for California's job market appears
so good for next year that workers can expect to receive their
highest pay raises since 1993, according to a recent survey.
</P>
<P>
   The survey also shows that one in three companies expects to
hire additional workers.
</P>
<P>
   About one-third of the 556 companies surveyed said they will
increase their budgets for salaries. Among the companies increasing
their budgets, the average merit increase next year will be 4.5
percent - the largest average percentage climb since 1993, when
salaries jumped 4.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Increases in other compensation, including cost-of-living
raises, bonuses and lump-sum payments, raise the total compensation
to 4.8 percent in 2000, according to the ``Year 2000 Budget
Survey,'' released Monday by the Employers Group, one of the
nation's oldest and largest human resources organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``This survey will get Alan Greenspan's attention, because the
wages generated by the tight labor market are definitely outpacing
the California Consumer Price Index, which is running around 2.5
percent,'' said Jack Kyser, chief economist of the Los Angeles
County Economic Development Corp.
</P>
<P>
   It will get the Federal Reserve chairman's attention ``because
California is such a large part of the national economy... The Fed
might take it as a sign of inflation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the five-county Los Angeles region, the survey found that
hourly workers could expect on average a 4.72 percent raise.
Clerical and technical workers would average a 4.75 percent raise,
with salaried employees receiving a 4.96 percent raise.
</P>
<P>
   Executives can expect to receive the largest raise next year,
with an average of 5.47 percent. The L.A. region encompasses Los
Angeles, Orange, Ventura, Riverside and San Bernardino counties.
</P>
<P>
   Staffing levels are also on the rise, with 33 percent of
companies in California expecting to increase their staff next
year, according to the survey. Fifty-five percent of companies
expect their staffing levels to remain the same, while 7.5 percent
of companies surveyed indicated they would lay off employees. The
remaining companies are uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in the Los Angeles region 50 percent of the
companies surveyed indicated they would maintain the same level of
hourly employees, according to Juan P. Garcia, research director
with Los Angeles-based Employers Group.
</P>
<P>
   The survey found that employee turnover was higher in Northern
California than in Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   ``As one might expect, turnover for the past 12 months was
higher in Northern California because of the difficulty to recruit
and retain people in the information technology sector,'' Garcia
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   In a 12-month period ending in September, Northern California
firms experienced a 16.9 percent turnover rate compared with a 13.9
percent rate in San Diego and 10.9 percent in the Los
Angeles-Orange County-Inland Empire region.
</P>
<P>
   This survey ``is semi-good news for California because it points
out we are a leader in high-tech,'' said Kyser, ``but also says we
are going to have to look closely at how we can keep up with the
demand for high-tech workers.''

THE INDEFATIGABLE STRAWBERRY IS BACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEVE CAMPBELL  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ They'd prefer not to dwell on it, but they remember.
They remember it well.
</P>
<P>
   They remember somberly assembling in front of the ESPN cameras
to send a live get-well card to an ailing teammate. They remember
having the No. 39 stitched into their New York Yankees caps. They
remember his wife leaving his side at the hospital long enough to
throw out the first pitch before the first game of the American
League Championship Series. They remember the World Series
champagne celebration in San Diego, the wishing that he could have
been there.
</P>
<P>
   Darryl Strawberry _ last October's cancer patient, this past
spring's lapsed drug addict _ is this fall's monument to recovery.
Strawberry has been back with the Yankees barely a month, and he's
already making himself indispensable. Even the Yankees wouldn't be
in the ALCS against the Boston Red Sox with pitching alone.
</P>
<P>
   A three-run home run by Strawberry accounted for the only runs
of Game 3 of the AL Division Series. With one cobra strike of his
bat, Strawberry provided the offense they needed to sweep the Texas
Rangers out of the way. The effortless swing that drove an Esteban
Loaiza fastball 415 feet underscores why people like Strawberry get
second and third and fourth and fifth chances. At 37, Straw still
can stir a drink with as much of a flourish as any Yankee this side
of Reggie Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's his style,'' Yankees designated hitter Chili Davis said
admiringly. ``That's why he's Darryl Strawberry.''
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry missed almost the entire regular season. He got just
enough September at-bats to fine-tune a swing that somehow has
stayed with him through all the years of drinks and drugs, of
falling down and picking himself back up. And it just so happened
that Yankees manager Joe Torre was keeping his DH options open,
because Davis was feeling the wear and tear of being 39.
</P>
<P>
   Just last year, Davis missed almost the entire regular season
because of a bum ankle. Davis got just enough September at-bats to
fine-tune his switch-hitting stroke. And it just so happened that
Torre was exploring his DH options, because Strawberry was in no
condition to play in the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry hit 24 homers last season before his diagnosis of
colon cancer came down between Games 2 and 3 of the ALDS. Two days
later, doctors removed 16 inches of Strawberry's large intestine.
Strawberry had hopes of making the season-opening roster, but the
Yankees left him in Tampa, Fla., for extended spring training. He
nearly gave himself a permanent vacation April 14 by getting
arrested on charges of cocaine possession and solicitation of a
prostitute.
</P>
<P>
   It would be nice if the likes of Torre wouldn't try to soften
Strawberry's succession of problems as ``hiccups.'' Aside from the
cancer, Strawberry has brought his problems on himself and his
teams. Here's a professed born-again Christian whose dossier
includes multiple drug suspensions, charges of spousal abuse and a
plea-bargain for tax evasion.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, Strawberry definitely isn't a quitter. On the
other hand, he had Hall-of-Fame talent and frittered away most of
it.
</P>
<P>
   Anybody who spends any time around Strawberry would be
hard-pressed not to like him. He has a soothing, upbeat clubhouse
presence. He doesn't complain about playing time. He says the right
things. Of course, he has had a lot of practice at figuring out
what people want to hear.
</P>
<P>
   The cycle keeps repeating itself nevertheless. Regression.
Redemption. Regression. Redemption. Regression.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever Straw's back is against the wall, that's when he's at
his best,'' Yankees shortstop Derek Jeter said. ``He saves his best
for last, in prime-time, when the spotlight's on.''
</P>
<P>
   That undoubtedly contributed to Torre's decision to use
Strawberry over Davis when the ALDS began. Strawberry did what he
could to make his case in 49 regular-season at-bats with the
Yankees, hitting .327 with six homers and 17 walks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love him,'' Davis said. ``I love what he does for us. ...
Whoever plays, the other guy will be pulling for him.'''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees prefer not to dwell on it, but they remember pulling
for Darryl Strawberry last October just to recover from cancer.
They remember it _ and his other troubles _ well. They made it a
point to have non-alcholic champagne on hand Saturday night when
they celebrated their sweep of the Rangers. He has been in recovery
from one thing or another.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having this again _ a postseason _ to me that says I didn't
give up when I really could have given up,'' Strawberry said. ``I
look in the mirror and I know whose fault it is. And I look in the
mirror and see the guy who is going to try and keep fighting.''

PICTURING A LOST BOY, DRAWING ON MEMORY  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 17) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By KAREN DURBIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some addiction counselors classify the children of alcoholics
into behavioral types: the hero child, who tries to save the family
by doing everything right; the scapegoat, who constantly fails and
gets into trouble; and the lost child, who goes AWOL from the
family dynamic and develops a private solution, sometimes with
disastrous results.
</P>
<P>
   With the ironically titled ``Joe the King,'' which opened on
Friday, Frank Whaley has made an intensely affecting yet
unsentimental movie about a lost child. That the film contains a
large dollop of autobiography _ it is dedicated to his parents _
only makes this 36-year-old actor's achievement more striking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe the King'' is Whaley's first outing as a writer and
director, and if this is what's considered a small film, it's an
exceptionally rich one. The movie won the screenwriting award at
this year's Sundance Festival, and it opens with a beautifully
composed pan of schoolchildren on the lawn at recess that feels
like a tour of childhood itself.
</P>
<P>
   We see children playing, reading, chatting, roughhousing and, in
a few lonely instances, wistfully looking on. Finally, beyond a
dense barrier of leafy shrubs, the camera finds Joe. He's slumped
against the side of the building, his hands in his pockets and his
back to the world.
</P>
<P>
   His hair is so short you wonder if his head has been shaved.
When the bell goes off, he jerks around to reveal a gaunt face and
hard, fearful eyes; a half-smoked cigarette droops from his mouth.
He can't be more than 9 or 10.
</P>
<P>
   The first 20 minutes of ``Joe the King'' are background,
sketching in the misery of Joe's early childhood before moving on.
His father (played without a scrap of vanity by a bloated,
bleary-looking Val Kilmer) is a surly drunk who does some of his
drinking at Joe's school, where he's the janitor.
</P>
<P>
   This makes him all but ubiquitous in his son's life. It also
makes Joe the target of cruelty by other children, and by a
sadistic teacher, who gives him a bare-bottom spanking in front of
the class after he throws an eraser at a child who has razzed him.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it happened today,'' Whaley says, ``she'd be arrested. She
pulled down my pants, and it was mortifying. It's like a dream _
you know how you remember moments of it? I remember the kids in the
class looked like they were in shock. They were as traumatized as I
was.''
</P>
<P>
   This scene points up the perils of autobiographical art. The
teacher, played with monstrous relish by Camryn Manheim _ it's one
of the movie's more piquant pleasures that we get to see some
high-profile actors in down-and-dirty roles _ is a villain of
near-Dickensian dimensions. Whaley says this is one incident that
was drawn from life, but reality has a way of pushing realism into
melodrama. What saves the scene is the way it's shot, with just the
faintest touch of Grand Guignol wit.
</P>
<P>
   Whaley likes to hear that his film is unsentimental. ``When
you're dealing with something of a personal nature, it's easy to
become precious with it,'' he says. ``Something you might sit at
home and cry about may not be important to the rest of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   His clipped speech and flattened vowels make Whaley, who grew up
in inner-city Syracuse, sound a little like a character out of a
1940s movie; with his pale, serious face, small features and thick
shock of brown hair, he looks like one, too. He could be a Dead End
Kid grown up or John Garfield's younger brother.
</P>
<P>
   He has had a busy 12-year film career, mostly with leading roles
in small films (``Swimming with Sharks,'' ``Homage'') and
supporting roles in big ones (``The Doors,'' ``Hoffa,'' ``Field of
Dreams.'')
</P>
<P>
   We meet at a French cafe in Chelsea, where Whaley lives. The
cafe, which specializes in crepes and coffee, isn't chic, exactly,
but it's very '90s. The young women who work there tend to be slim
and leggy, the men incline to fashionable, convict-cropped hair or
retro-hippie locks.
</P>
<P>
   In this setting, maybe what makes Whaley stand out most is his
complete lack of self-absorption. He seems far more interested in
what's going on around him than in himself, and he enjoys a joke.
When a thunderous pounding erupts in the kitchen, he deadpans,
``They're beating up a couple of Belgians back there.''
</P>
<P>
   Whaley's sense of humor works like yeast in ``Joe the King.''
But what really saves the movie from sinking into simple pathos is
his decision to focus on his protagonist in adolescence. At 9, Joe
is inescapably a victim. At 14, he has begun to contend with his
lousy circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   His tactics are hustle and evasion. This is a boy navigating in
a sea of adults who, with few exceptions, either ignore or injure
him. His teachers get on him about the money they've been dumb
enough to lend his endlessly cadging father.
</P>
<P>
   As played by Karen Young (in a performance so beautifully
contained that Whaley instructed his child actors to make her their
model), his mother is a once tender woman cauterized by abuse and
disappointment. She takes the brunt of her husband's violence,
partly to deflect it from her children. But suffering deforms more
than it ennobles.
</P>
<P>
   Whaley expresses gratitude for his own mother, Josephine
Timilione, who he thinks married his father because ``she wanted a
little danger.'' But ``the pain and the pleasure kind of mangled
her,'' he adds.
</P>
<P>
   In the film, Joe's mother bullies the boy but occasionally gives
him a treat, when she's not altogether withdrawn. So he does his
best to duck his tormentors and look after himself. He has a decent
older brother, but Joe is essentially a loner.
</P>
<P>
   He works long nights washing dishes in a greasy spoon. He's also
an opportunistic thief, well-acquainted with the local pawnbroker.
Sometimes he's an impulsive thief as well, stealing things he can't
use or sell, like the tampon he nabs from a classmate's locker. He
squirrels it away in his secret hideout under the family's shabby
house, to take apart and examine later. (He really is raising
himself; nobody's teaching him anything.)
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Joe is also given to fits of compulsive eating, as well as acts
of unexpected generosity. As he wolfs down a stolen box of Ho Ho's,
some children who are obviously as poor as he is draw near to
watch. He looks at them for a moment and then shares.
</P>
<P>
   When he was growing up, Whaley says: ``I would go to other kids'
houses and they'd open the cupboard and it would be full of food.
And it was like opening the f heaven. And I'd say, `Why
aren't you eating that?' And they'd say, `We'll eat it later.' And
I'd think, `Eat it  &UR; now. &LR; '''
</P>
<P>
   Smiling, he says of Noah Fleiss, the young New York actor who
plays Joe: ``He's a happy kid. His parents are professionals. He's
got a cell phone. He's never been hungry. He'd start to eat a
cookie, and I had to say, `No, man, you've got to shove that cookie
into your mouth. Or they're going to take it from you.'''
</P>
<P>
   Like that of Peter Tambakis, who plays the younger Joe, Fleiss'
performance conveys a pervasive sense of deprivation. It's there in
his slight frame and the denim jacket and jeans that seem to be his
only clothes, and most of all in the unnervingly old look in his
eyes, a mix of wariness, cynicism and resignation. One thing Joe is
being deprived of is his childhood.
</P>
<P>
   That the performances in ``Joe the King'' are consistently
excellent may be due in part to Whaley's experience directing and
acting onstage. That, and an enticing script, helped attract an
extraordinary array of name talent to his film.
</P>
<P>
   Ethan Hawke, a close friend with whom he founded the
Off-Broadway theater troupe Malaparte, is all but unrecognizable in
the film as a pudgy, distracted guidance counselor whose clumsy
attempt to help Joe turns out to be the boy's undoing. Hawke says
he gained weight not for the role but in empathy with the pregnancy
of his wife, Uma Thurman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was empathetically eating chocolate bars in bed,'' he says,
laughing. ``I think Frank got some sort of perverse pleasure out of
making Val and me look as disgusting as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Hawke's attachment to the project helped raise the money for it,
as did John Leguizamo's. Leguizamo plays the one friendly adult in
Joe's life, a womanizing waiter who warns him to stop gobbling
leftovers off the customers' plates because he might catch
something and then, barely pausing for his subconscious to take a
breath, launches into a lewd rhapsody about oral sex.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, somebody had to tell him,'' jokes Leguizamo, who shot his
scenes over three very long days in June 1998, commuting between
the film's Staten Island location and the Broadway theater where he
was doing his hit one-man show, ``Freak,'' also a tale of errant
sons and a fearsome father.
</P>
<P>
   Leguizamo is the executive producer of ``Joe the King.'' His
company, Lower East Side Productions, helped raise the $1.7 million
budget, and he helped convince Kilmer to play the all-important
role of the father. If the movie is about the son, the father is
still the pivot on which the boy's future turns.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it's fitting, then, that Whaley is never more eloquent,
sometimes painfully so, than when talking about his father, who,
before he left the family for good, tried to warn his 16-year-old
son away from his own destructive path.
</P>
<P>
   This is one of a scattering of moments Whaley hoards like
treasure _ an ``expression of love from this ghost of a man,'' he
calls it. Although he later gave his father money and tried to help
him to a better life, they were estranged when Robert W. Whaley
died a decade ago of alcohol-related illness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think now that the demons began very slowly to enter his
body,'' Whaley says. ``When I first remember him, he was my age,
mid-30s, and he was a beer guy, he drank a lot of beer, and I
thought he was pretty charismatic. But alcohol is like heroin or
any drug. So 10 years later he was drinking $2 whisky at 11 in the
morning. That was his destiny, I think. He was born into that life;
his father was that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I'm angry that he didn't do things differently. The
guy had a job. It wasn't glamorous, but those guys, after 25 years
of working that job, they can make a nice income. A lot of his
buddies had two-car garages, they had nice lawns and they had nice
families. They had a basketball net in their driveway; they went to
the supermarket on Sunday. He had a family! Guys like that, all
they can hope for, they're not going to seek fame or fortune, but
they can raise up their kids the right way. And watch them grow.
And then when they're 65 or 70 years old, they can say: `That's my
son. Look at him, he wrote a movie.'''

FACT, FICTION, WHO CARES?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF GUINN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A note to our readers: Former first lady Nancy Reagan did not
write this review; books editor Jeff Guinn did. But since Edmund
Morris, the author of ``Dutch,'' inserted himself as a fictional
character in his book about Ronald Reagan, we thought, hey, why not
give it a try?
</P>
<P>
   ``Dutch: A Memoir of Ronald Reagan''
</P>
<P>
   By Edmund Morris
</P>
<P>
   Biography
</P>
<P>
   Random House, $35
</P>
<P>
   By ``Nancy Reagan''
</P>
<P>
   I remember when someone on my husband's staff, that roly-poly
Michael Deaver, probably, said we needed to bring in a historian to
observe firsthand some of Ronnie's time in office and write a book
about it afterward. A ``good'' book, not one of those tell-all
things. A few weeks later, I noticed this slovenly, bearded man
hanging around the Oval Office. He was introduced to me as Edmund
Morris, an author who won the Pulitzer Prize for his biography of
Theodore Roosevelt. Everybody else seemed to like him, and Ronnie
didn't care one way or the other, so he stayed and later on kept us
waiting for years and years before he finally got that book
written.
</P>
<P>
   All that waiting, and the dreary little man has let us down. He
made up parts, if you can believe that, and he says he did it
because he couldn't figure out any other way to write about Ronnie.
Thousands of other writers and journalists and press people
certainly were able to during our years in office, so I can't
understand why the supposedly wonderful Mr. Morris couldn't manage
such a simple thing. Maybe his vocabulary is as limited as his
wardrobe. (He wears the same suit three days in a row! I think he
only has two or three).
</P>
<P>
   A lot of people are criticizing this so-called memoir without
even reading it, since biographers are supposed to stick to the
facts. Even though people warned me, I decided to read it before
offering my opinion, and I have and now I am: It's dreadful. Awful.
Edmund Morris has such a pleasant way of writing about the tackiest
things that I'm very much afraid people will read ``Dutch'' from
cover to cover. Comparing my eyes to ``two large, pale,
accompanying jellyfish?'' Really! Though that's not the worst part.
Mr. Morris sort of invents himself as a character and pretends he
was in different places seeing things with his own eyes. I know, I
know, he claims he's just using some new way of writing a
biography, but how can you feel like you're reading actual history
when you're never really certain which parts are true and which are
made up? It's like those terrible old days when Patti broke curfew
and would have all kinds of excuses when she finally got home. Once
or twice, I nearly woke Ronnie up so he could hear that drivel for
himself.
</P>
<P>
   And, frankly, I don't think this so-called new technique of Mr.
Morris' gets many results, although there are a few good insights.
For instance, Mr. Morris says Ronnie, like all actors, remembers
the future rather than the past _ it comes from memorizing scripts,
he thinks. You know, an actor has to know the lines being shot
today while, at the same time, he's trying to memorize his lines
for the next day's shooting. This is why Ronnie occasionally got
facts about his past wrong, Mr. Morris says _ little things like
his children's names.
</P>
<P>
   There is entirely too much space devoted to Ronnie's supposed
love affairs, which no one cares about anyway, or at least they
shouldn't. And there's a lot about that first woman he married,
which I suppose is inevitable, although I must admit the book
brightens considerably when I come into the story. Mr. Morris calls
Ronnie's and my romance a love story for the ages. At least he got
that right.
</P>
<P>
   I expect people will be most critical of the last third of the
book. That's when Mr. Morris stops making things up and pretty much
concentrates on Ronnie in the White House. He actually was there
watching and taking notes, of course, so he didn't have to resort
to make-believe. Yet this part is, frankly, pretty boring. Instead
of chat about Hollywood, there are pages and pages about
legislation and things. There are also some unnecessary comments
about my astrologer; I should have asked her about Mr. Morris
before I agreed to let him write the book about Ronnie! We'd have
saved ourselves grief, believe me!
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Morris sums things up by saying Ronnie was simply
unknowable, that while he seemed friendly he really was sort of
distant, aloof. Even his immediate staff aren't supposed to have
ever felt entirely comfortable with him, and that one part about
the Bushes, and Ronnie never thanking them for their 75th birthday
gift to him! I just know George would never have said such a thing,
although I wouldn't put it past Barbara. People with weight
problems are like that, you know.
</P>
<P>
   Like most other unfair criticism of my husband _ that
Iran-Contra thing is a good example, although Mr. Morris does point
out Ronnie had just had surgery when he more or less approved it _
I think ``Dutch'' will eventually be forgotten, thank goodness. It
is obviously a book written for the money; I've heard for as much
as $3 million. I wouldn't pay a penny for it; if I want to read
made-up things about my husband, I'll try Jane Wyman's diary. Come
to think of it, I'll bet she put Mr. Morris up to the whole thing.
Her or Barbara Bush.

FOR BRIDGET JONES FANS, `A LITTLE MORE' ABOUT HER DIARIST 
</HEADLINE>

   A LITTLE MORE ABOUT ME &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By Pam Houston &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Norton, 288 pp., $23.95 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I recently lent a young male friend ``Bridget Jones's Diary,''
the comic novel about an over-the-top neurotic single woman. After
reading some of it, he e-mailed me: ``Women are not really that
completely without confidence and desperate as that Bridget Jones
girl, or are they?''
</P>
<P>
   My friend, bless his heart, hasn't yet learned that many of the
strongest-seeming women have their own bits of Bridget _ a
character consumed by worry about her weight, men, and being at
peace with herself.
</P>
<P>
   These shared self-doubts are part of the bond among women, and a
large part of the reason writer Pam Houston has so many fans. Here
is a woman who has scaled mountains, guided numerous white-water
rafting trips, and led hunters through the Alaskan wilderness. Her
20s were spent ticking off, and writing about, one adventure after
the other, on five continents. All the while, she fretted about her
weight almost constantly, was largely motivated by men and romance,
and endlessly struggled to find peace with herself. In short, she's
Indiana Jones meets Bridget Jones.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Little More About Me,'' a collection of personal essays, is
her first nonfiction work, though her previous books, the very
popular ``Cowboys Are My Weakness'' and ``Waltzing the Cat,''
clearly had their roots in autobiography, as Houston has readily
confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   Only a handful of the book's offerings are new; most were either
published in women's and outdoors magazines or appeared in
anthologies. In ``The Long Way to Safety,'' an introduction of
sorts, Houston has finally (her summation) settled down, at a ranch
she bought in Creede, Colo., elevation 9,000 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Says the typically conflicted Houston: ``The road I've taken
these five years has been a long and twisted one. . . .Through the
windshield I can see everything I want to take with me: horses and
men and mountains and rivers. But in the rearview mirror, damned if
I don't see horses and men and mountains and rivers, everything I
need to leave behind.''
</P>
<P>
   In her late 30s, Houston has determined that ``the edge,''
though it still beckons, has lost much appeal. ``How many times can
you walk to the same edge and find it interesting? . . .I see new,
more interesting edges everywhere I look: artistic, spiritual,
emotional, even physical edges that don't necessarily involve
risking my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Because these essays were composed during a five-year span, some
relate more to the Indiana Jones, some to the Bridget; in others
the two meet and duke it out, or perhaps wind up in couples
counseling.
</P>
<P>
   Houston's writing is at its sparkling best when chronicling
trips, while gazing more at the stars than at herself. ``Soul of
the Andes'' brings together what is beautiful, maddening, and great
fun about South American travel. And she pays moving homage to the
people and the land of Bhutan in ``In Bhutan,There is No Way to be
Famous,'' based on her rugged Himalayan trek there.
</P>
<P>
   It's in the grouping of essays titled ``One Long Look in the
Mirror'' that the author's self-doubt, even self-loathing, becomes
almost too painful too bear. But one can understand the source of
her emptiness and confusion. Houston's father, a natural athlete,
wanted her to rival Chris Evert in tennis. She didn't come close.
Her mother, a former actress, wanted Houston to be beautiful, which
to her mind meant thin, with well-applied makeup and good hair. She
failed again. Her home was cold, violent, and unsafe, and Houston
believes that is why she went after danger, to find the
``comforts'' of home.
</P>
<P>
   While men come and men go, her dogs remain by her side. Her deep
connection with them is chronicled in several pieces, including the
final essay, ``Home is Where Your Dogs Are,'' a sweet eulogy for
her canine companion Jackson and a homecoming for herself. Though
she will always mourn her longtime sidekick, ``I no longer feel
like I won't be able to live without him. He saw me through the
loneliest years . . . years that I needed to live through, before I
could find my way home.''

departments from releasing arrest records to companies and people
who want to sell the information.
</P>
<P>
   Several justices questioned the law's validity, saying the
prohibition might unconstitutionally restrict the free-speech
rights of companies seeking to publish the information. But others
indicated that the statute might be a constitutional way to protect
the privacy of arrestees and ensure they are not inundated with
unwelcome solicitations from lawyers and social workers.
</P>
<P>
   The case before the justices arose when United Reporting
Publishing Corp., which provides names and addresses to law firms
and other businesses, sued the Los Angeles Police Department in
1996 to gain access to arrest records. The police had refused to
release the information to the company, citing the California
Public Records Act, which limits release of the records to
organizations with a scholarly, journalistic, political or
governmental purpose.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. district court and then the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals ruled for the publishing company. In its decision, the 9th
Circuit rejected the state's argument that it sought to protect the
privacy of arrestees, noting that the information is made available
to newspapers that can publish the information at will.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Thomas Goldstein, pressing the police department's
appeal, conceded that the controversial law restricts corporate
access to the records but added that the restriction is necessary
to protect the privacy of arrestees. He said companies like United
Reporting indiscriminately sell the information to professional
service agencies.
</P>
<P>
   But Justice Antonin Scalia appeared unswayed, noting that the
law allows newspapers to have unrestricted access to the records.
Newspapers, just like United Reporting, are in the business of
selling information, Scalia said.
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein, of Washington, D.C., responded that the
``constitutional tradition'' of freedom of the press entitles
newspapers to the information. No such constitutional protection
exists for companies seeking to sell information to solicitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are massive wholesale invasions of privacy'' when
companies like United Reporting sell the information to attorneys
and social workers, Goldstein said. The data in the arrest records
is a mere ``commodity'' to United Reporting, he added, drawing a
stinging rebuke from Justice David H. Souter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Information is a commodity to the New York Times,'' Souter
said, indicating that no legal difference exists between United
Reporting and newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant Solicitor General Edward DuMont, pressing the Clinton
administration's support for the California law, conceded that
newspapers are free to publish information they get from police and
other state agencies. But states should remain free to dictate that
the information it releases will not be used for commercial gain,
he added.
</P>
<P>
   For example, DuMont said the Los Angeles Times can publish the
names and addresses of arrestees, but it cannot use the information
for the commercial purpose of soliciting subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   But Scalia objected, saying the Constitution prohibits states
from providing information to one industry _ newspapers _ while
keeping it from others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe Sixpack should be able to do anything with the information
that the press can do,'' Scalia said.
</P>
<P>
   In response, DuMont said United Reporting is just as free as
newspapers to publish any information it acquires. However, the
Constitution does not require that the state help the company
gather the data.
</P>
<P>
   United Reporting's attorney, Bruce Ennis, countered that the
California law violates the First Amendment by permitting police to
discriminate between speakers, giving information to newspapers but
not to other companies. Ennis said the law violates constitutional
protections for commercial speech by keeping information from
companies involved in solicitation.
</P>
<P>
   But Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state is not saying, `We don't like solicitors,''' she
said. Instead, California is trying to protect the privacy of
arrestees by restricting public access to their home addresses.
</P>
<P>
   The high court is expected to render its decision in the case,
Los Angeles Police Department vs. United Reporting Publishing
Corp., by July.

U.S.-COLOMBIA STING LEADS TO ARRESTS OF DRUG LORDS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By ANDREW BROMAN 
and JOHN OTIS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Two men considered leaders of what was once the
world's largest illegal drug operation were among 30 people
arrested in Colombia in a major sting, U.S. law enforcement
officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is as if we have removed the CEOs of several major
corporations who had joined together in a major conspiracy,''
Attorney General Janet Reno said at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
   The arrests came from a joint investigation by the United States
and Colombia, dubbed Operation Millennium. Officials called the
arrests the biggest blow to Colombian trafficking since 1995 when
arrests splintered the powerful Cali cartel.
</P>
<P>
   Colombia remains the world's leading supplier of cocaine
although authorities broke up the Medellin cartel in 1993 and then
the Cali cartel. Smaller, lower-profile organizations took over the
business and were the targets of Operation Millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Two former Medellin leaders, Alejandro Bernal-Madrigal and Fabio
Ochoa-Vasquez, were among those arrested Wednesday. Both men are
suspected leaders of current Colombian drug trafficking networks.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. investigators will seek to extradite those arrested and
prosecute them in Florida. They will be charged with money
laundering and drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Operation Millennium revealed not only the scope of the
Colombian and Mexican trafficking networks, but exposed Bernal's
command, control and intelligence nerve center ... to law
enforcement scrutiny,'' said U.S. attorney for the Southern
District of Florida Tom Scott.
</P>
<P>
   At a press conference in Bogota, Colombia's capital, the
National Police chief, Gen. Rosso Jose Serrano, said Operation
Millennium involved a year of tracking the suspects in close
cooperation with the Drug Enforcement Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators tapped cellular phone communications and broke
into Internet communication systems to gather the evidence to make
the indictments, said DEA administrator Donnie Marshall.
</P>
<P>
   He said the arrests will disrupt the distribution of 30 tons of
cocaine per month. ``Undoubtedly, others will step in,'' he said.
But the operation was designed to ``dilute the talent pool'' of
drug networks so that investigators can more easily track
traffickers, Marshall said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials seized about 14 tons of cocaine, of which about 11
tons were hidden in a Mexican fishing boat captured Aug. 13 by the
U.S. Coast Guard.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, the investigation led to the seizure of 1,562 pounds
of cocaine Aug. 30 in Galveston.
</P>
<P>
   The arrests came about one month after another productive sting,
called Operation Impunity, broke up a Mexico-based cocaine
smuggling network. Nearly 13 tons of cocaine, 4,800 pounds of
marijuana, $19 million in currency and $7 million in other assets
were seized in that sting, which produced 93 arrests.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall said the two operations were closely linked.
``Operation Impunity was what you might call the downstream side,
traffickers who transport and distribute the drugs into and inside
the United States,'' he said. ``Operation Millennium focused on the
major cocaine suppliers, like Bernal-Madrigal, who was responsible
for shipping vast quanof cocaine into Mexico for the forward
shipping to the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials said the extradition of those charged in Colombia
was key to the investigation. They said an amendment to the
Colombian Constitution in 1997, which permitted the extradition of
Colombian nationals, will allow the extraditions to take place.
</P>
<P>
   Drug traffickers have slipped through Colombia's judicial system
in the past. Ochoa was released from prison three years ago after
serving two-of an eight year term for drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm innocent. I swear it before my children, before my dead
mother,'' Ochoa said Wednesday in Colombia as he was led away by
police. When asked if he thought he would be extradited to the
United States, he replied: ``Of course.''
</P>
<P>
   Ochoa's two older brothers, Jorge Luis and Juan David, also
served jail time for drug trafficking and were released in 1996.

COURT APPEARS POISED TO ADVANCE FEDERALISM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ala., Fla., Calif., Mass., Ohio)  (th) 
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A Supreme Court argument Wednesday in the first of
the new term's federalism cases demonstrated convincingly that the
states'-rights majority on the court had lost none of its energy
over the summer recess.
</P>
<P>
   The question was whether Congress validly bound the states to
the federal law that protects older workers against discrimination
on the job. The answer appeared almost certain to be ``no,'' by the
5-4 split familiar from the trio of decisions last spring by which
the court carved out new immunities for the states from the
application of federal laws.
</P>
<P>
   What was less certain, by the end of the argument, was the route
the court would take to that outcome, and how many other federal
laws might be curbed in their application to the states as a
result.
</P>
<P>
   The justices heard an appeal brought jointly by the federal
government and by a group of state university professors and
librarians from Florida and Alabama, who sued their state employers
for age discrimination in a case that was dismissed last year by
the federal appeals court in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The 2-1 decision by the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals did
not have a majority rationale. One judge in the majority said that
Congress had not been sufficiently clear in expressing its
intention to apply the Age Discrimination in Employment Act to the
states through a 1974 amendment to that law.
</P>
<P>
   The other judge said that while Congress made itself clear, it
lacked the authority to overcome the states' sovereign immunity
from suit under the 11th amendment, which shields states from suit
in federal court.
</P>
<P>
   A Supreme Court decision that Congress should have been more
explicit would leave Congress free to rewrite the 1974 amendment,
and would not have far-reaching consequences.
</P>
<P>
   But a constitutional ruling that Congress lacked authority to
make states liable to age discrimination suits, on the other hand,
would raise a new round of questions about the ability of Congress
to define and legislate protection for civil rights that the court
itself has viewed as having only a minimal constitutional
dimension.
</P>
<P>
   The court has never ruled that discrimination on the basis of
age is unconstitutional, and Justice Antonin Scalia said Wednesday
that he found it ``extraordinary'' that Congress ``just went
ahead'' and did so on its own.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist noted that the court had
ruled in a 1976 case that Massachusetts did not violate the
constitutional rights of its state troopers by making them retire
at age 50. ``We said there was no invidious discrimination,''
Rehnquist said, addressing the state employees' lawyer, Jeremiah A.
Collins. ``Can Congress change constitutional law?'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The court's recent rulings on state immunity and constitutional
lawmaking provided a subtext for the argument Wednesday. The
justices have already greatly circumscribed the ability of Congress
to make federal law binding on the states, beginning with a 1996
ruling in Seminole Tribe vs. Florida that the exercise of
congressional power to regulate interstate commerce is not enough
to trump the states' immunity under the 11th amendment.
</P>
<P>
   That decision left Congress another avenue, Section 5 of the
14th amendment, which authorizes Congress to enforce, by
``appropriate legislation,'' the amendment's guarantees of equal
protection and due process.
</P>
<P>
   However, a decision last June in a case called Florida Prepaid
vs. College Savings Bank suggested that the ability of Congress to
act under Section 5 was narrower than it had long appeared,
indicating that the court would closely inspect the rationale for
legislating under the 14th amendment.
</P>
<P>
   The Florida Prepaid case concerned suits for patent
infringement, far removed from the civil rights concerns at the
heart of the 14th amendment. The case Wednesday, Kimel vs. Florida
Board of Regents, No. 98-791, for the first time brings a civil
rights issue within the court's new states'-rights focus.
</P>
<P>
   As the justices and lawyers were well aware, other cases raising
similar federalism questions under the Americans with Disabilities
Act, the Equal Pay Act and other federal civil rights laws are
waiting in the wings, with the climate for considering such cases
sharply different now from what it was even a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   By her questions Wednesday, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg evinced
some concern that a 1976 precedent that upheld suits against states
under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the basic federal
law against employment discrimination, might now be on shaky
ground.
</P>
<P>
   When Collins, the state employees' lawyer, said in response to a
series of questions by Scalia that ``this court has always looked
at what Congress has done with a presumption of
constitutionality,'' a comment that would have been merely a
statement of the obvious a few years ago took on a plaintive,
almost archaic tone.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara D. Underwood, a deputy solicitor general who was arguing
the federal government's portion of the appeal, said that Congress
acted on the basis of abundant evidence that ``public employers
were engaging in arbitrary and irrational discrimination'' on
account of age.
</P>
<P>
   That the court has not given age discrimination the same
constitutional scrutiny as discrimination on the basis or race or
sex does not place it beyond the power of Congress to address, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Scalia said he did not find age discrimination to be irrational
as a general matter, adding that ``to say it's unconstitutional
boggles my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Arguing for the states, Jeffrey S. Sutton said the age
discrimination law was an example of congressional
``overprotection'' of constitutional rights, ``unlike any other''
law the court has ever upheld under Section 5 of the 14th
amendment.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   He cited the court's 1997 decision that struck down the
Religious Freedom Restoration Act on the ground that Congress in
that law gave more protection to religious observance than the
court itself had found to be constitutionally required.
</P>
<P>
   Sutton, who is now in private practice, was then Ohio's state
solicitor, and argued before the court on behalf of a group of
states that the religious freedom law was unconstitutional. The
lesson of that case, he said, was that congressional judgment ``is
entitled to some respect, but not complete respect'' by the court.
</P>
<P>
   The court will hear at least three other federalism cases in the
next few months, including whether Congress had authority 
the Violence Against Women Act, giving federal courts jurisdiction
to hear domestic violence cases that are traditionally matters of
state court jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
   In a second argument Wednesday, the court debated the
constitutionality of a California law under which the addresses of
people who have been arrested are made available to the news media
and for some other specified purposes, but not to those who seek to
use the information ``directly or indirectly to sell a product or
service.''
</P>
<P>
   The law was successfully challenged in the federal appeals court
in San Francisco by a company that supplies the arrest information
to lawyers, insurance companies, drug abuse counselors, driving
schools and others who then solicit business from people facing
criminal charges. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals held the
law was an unconstitutional restriction on commercial speech.
</P>
<P>
   In a wide-ranging discussion Wednesday, the justices considered
how to draw the line between the press and other publishers of
information, as well as whether the appeals court was correct to
find a constitutional problem in the selective denial of access to
material the government is not obliged to disclose at all. The case
is Los Angeles Police Department vs. United Reporting Publishing
Corp., No. 98-678.

DISPARITIES FOUND IN SUCCESS OF ORGAN TRANSPLANTS AT 100
HOSPITALS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Kan., Md.)  (th) 
 By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As Congress considers two measure that would affect
the future of the nation's organ transplant system, the Clinton
administration released a study Wednesday showing startling
disparities in the success rates of more than 100 hospitals that
treat heart and liver transplant patients.
</P>
<P>
   The study, conducted by an epidemiologist at the Department of
Health and Human Services, looked at what percentage of patients
received hearts and livers, what percentage were still alive and
what percentage had died, regardless of whether they had received
new organs. But it did not explain the reason for the variations
from hospital to hospital.
</P>
<P>
   It found, for example, that at University of Kansas Medical
Center in Kansas City, 89 percent of patients who signed up for a
liver received one within a year, and fewer than 8 percent of the
patients on the list had died. But at the University of Maryland in
Baltimore, just 21 percent had received a liver, and 21 percent
died.
</P>
<P>
   The study found that over all, in both liver and heart
transplants, about two-thirds of the deaths occurred while patients
were waiting for organs. But it also found that performing
transplants quickly after a patient is listed does not necessarily
lead to better survival rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``The striking finding is that there is a very wide variation in
the rates of transplantation among the various hospitals,'' said
Dr. Henry Krakauer, the study's author. ``So the question arises:
Why is this happening?''
</P>
<P>
   That is a question the study does not answer. And while the
analysis accounted for the severity of a patient's illness, it did
not account for other factors that might influence a transplant
center's performance, such as whether a patient received
preoperative and postoperative care at other hospitals, or whether
a small hospital's ranking might be skewed by the death of just one
or two people.
</P>
<P>
   The study, the first hospital-by-hospital examination of what
happens to all patients who put their names on the transplant list,
was based on data collected by the United Network for Organ
Sharing, the nonprofit organization that contracts with the health
and human services agency to run the transplant system. A spokesman
for the network, Joel Newman, described the study as ''an
interesting report,'' but questioned its usefulness.
</P>
<P>
   The study, which appears to buttress the administration's
argument that the organ allocation system is unfair, comes just as
it is facing two battles in Congress over how the transplant system
should be run.
</P>
<P>
   In February, 1998, Donna Shalala, the secretary of Health and
Human Services, released data showing that the time patients spent
waiting on transplant lists varied greatly from region to region,
and ordered the network to change its policies so that scarce
organs could be shared more broadly across state and city lines.
</P>
<P>
   But the network complained so vigorously that Congress put a
moratorium on the government's proposed rule. That moratorium is
set to expire next Thursday; Congress is considering whether to
extend it for another year. If it is not extended, Shalala has said
she will put her rule into effect.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the National Organ Transplant Act, the law
that declares organs a national resource and sets out broad
guidelines for how they should be allocated, is up for
reauthorization. The House Commerce Committee sent a bill to the
full House on Wednesday that would greatly reduce Shalala's
authority over the organ sharing network; the administration
opposes the bill.

YEN RECOVERS FROM NEWS THAT JAPAN MIGHT INCREASE MONEY SUPPLY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ The Bank of Japan moved Wednesday to expand the range of
tools it could use to increase the supply of money in the economy
to help weaken the resurgent yen.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's currency initially tumbled more than 1 percent in
response to the action, taken by the central bank after an
unusually long monthly meeting of its policy board.
</P>
<P>
   But there was considerable confusion in the financial markets
about whether the bank's action marked a policy change or something
less significant.
</P>
<P>
   In a reflection of skepticism about the effectiveness of the
action, the yen recovered from a low of 107.96 per dollar
immediately after the bank's meeting in Tokyo to 106.60 per dollar
by the end of trading in New York _ only slightly weaker than its
106.31 per dollar exchange rate a day earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The Bank of Japan has been under increasing pressure from the
government and its global economic partners, notably the United
States, to take steps that would weaken the yen, which has risen to
the highest levels in more than three years against the dollar.
</P>
<P>
   The yen's strength is threatening to undermine Japan's slow
recovery from its worst recession in a half-century by hurting the
sales and profits of Japanese exporters.
</P>
<P>
   In a display of independence, the Bank of Japan has shown little
sign of capitulation to the domestic and foreign pressure to weaken
the yen. Rather, the central bank has been insisting that its
monetary policy of keeping interest rates extremely low and keeping
1 trillion in excess cash sloshing around in the system is
sufficient.
</P>
<P>
   But the action Tuesday seemed to at least mark an enhancement of
that policy. The bank said that it would expand the maturity range
of government securities it purchases from time to time, which
theoretically could put even more yen into circulation and dilute
the currency's value.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall Gittler, an economist at the Bank of America in Hong
Kong, said the bank's decision could even lead to purchases of
long-term government bonds, something the bank has staunchly
resisted in the past.
</P>
<P>
   But most analysts seemed to be concluding that while the bank's
decision might be a more effective way of increasing the supply of
yen in the system, it was not an about-face by the bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``All they have done is open another channel for their money
market operations,'' said Robert Alan Feldman, chief economist at
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in Tokyo. ``It doesn't mean they'll use
it, and it doesn't mean a change of policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather, Feldman said, he read it as an effort by the bank to
demonstrate concern about the impact of the yen's strength.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey D. Young, an economist at Nikko Salomon Smith Barney who
has written about the possibility of the bank adding treasury note
purchases to its tool chest, agreed. ``People inside the bank are
not convinced the economy is in a self-sustaining recovery, and
they're worried about the rise of the yen and bond yields,'' he
said. ``They're looking for a way of boosting the impact their
policy has, and this is one way of doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior bank official confirmed the economists' analysis.
``Nothing has changed,'' he said. ``The essence of the bank's
policy has not changed, but it has tried to make the appearance
more attractive.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the bank had made no commitment to increasing the amount
of the yen in the system and that he did not expect it to do so.
``Unless you see the bank put more than 1 trillion yen of surplus
money into the market tomorrow morning, it has not changed its
policy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first time the Bank of Japan has sent confusing
messages about its monetary policy. At a meeting of finance
ministers from the Group of Seven industrialized nations in
Washington last month, the Bank of Japan similarly perplexed
reporters and others with an opaque statement about its stance,
leading some to report that it had succumbed to the prodding of the
ministry of finance and the U.S. Treasury Department to print money
and take other measures to further ease monetary policy.
</P>
<P>
   So alarmed was the bank by what it perceived as a severe
misunderstanding of its position that Masaru Hayami, the bank's
governor, held a hastily called news conference a day later to deny
that the bank had signaled a major departure from its policy.

INTERNET OFFERING MORE ITEMS FOR FREE, BUT AT A PRICE 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By SAUL HANSELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   For years, marketers have known that one word, more than any
other, can spur people to action.
</P>
<P>
   The magic word, of course, is ``free.'' And the wheels of
commerce havereased with free samples, free trial issues,
free toasters at the bank, or free tote bags with every bottle of
perfume.
</P>
<P>
   But those are nothing more than Cracker Jack prizes compared
with what's happening these days on the Internet, where the slogan
is quickly becoming: buy nothing, get everything free.
</P>
<P>
   ``You name it, and there is a start-up somewhere that wants to
give it away free,'' said James Breyer, the managing partner of
Accel Partners, a big Silicon Valley venture-capital firm.
</P>
<P>
   The World Wide Web, after all, took off because free browser
software enabled access to an ever-wider range of free information,
including all sorts of things like magazine articles and stock
quotes, that people had been accustomed to paying for.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with hundreds of Internet start-ups hellbent on immediate
visibility and rapid growth, the giveaways have moved beyond
information into products and services that sometimes cost hundreds
of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Today, with nothing more than a computer hooked up to the
Internet, you can download a word-processing program or a recording
of a hit single, sign up for a new phone number to receive faxes
and voice mail, and organize your Rolodex and expense-account forms
_ all without paying a penny.
</P>
<P>
   You can even find a site that will set you up in business with
your own online store free, if you can think of something to sell
that people will pay for.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to take advantage of this costless cornucopia but
are not yet wired to the Web, don't despair. A bunch of companies
want to provide free Internet access. FreePC.com hopes to give away
a computer too. And if you need to communicate with your militantly
unwired Uncle Waldo, postage4free.com will send you a stack of
stamped envelopes, gratis.
</P>
<P>
   All this free stuff comes at a price, of course. Those free
envelopes are covered with advertising, and so are most of the
other free offers. To get freebies, customers often must also
disclose a dossier's worth of personal information for use by
marketers and put up with minimal customer service.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone wants to listen to 30 seconds of commercials to
make a free two-minute long-distance call, as offered by
mytalk.com. But enough of these deals are attracting enough
customers that the free offers keep coming, despite questions about
whether there will be enough advertising to support many more such
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   MyTalk is hardly striking fear in the heart of AT&AMP;T, but other
giveaways are already roiling certain markets.
</P>
<P>
   Investors in Internet service providers are scared by the
prospect of free competitors. And relatively few companies are
developing new software programs because so many functions can now
be performed on the Web free.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are markets that could be spoiled,'' said Gill Cogan, a
general partner with the venture-capital arm of Weiss, Peck &AMP;
Greer. ``After you give something away free, it is very difficult
to start charging for it, or even for other things.''
</P>
<P>
   The trend is being driven by the ever-plummeting prices on
computers and communications, which make it so inexpensive to offer
many of these services that it makes as much sense to give them
away covered in ads as it does to try to sell them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The general rule is that anything that has a potential for a
broad audience will eventually be free,'' said Joe Kraus, a
co-founder of the Excite service, which searches the Web free and
now also offers free e-mail, voice mail, auctions, classified ads,
chat rooms and a small library's worth of information. Ultimately,
he said, companies would rather have consumers' time than their
money.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are shifting from a retail economy to what I call an
attention economy,'' Kraus said. ``You are willing to give away
services or even pay people to use services, if you can get a lot
of people listening to your message.''
</P>
<P>
   Marketers have always looked to place ads in new and prominent
locations, but the popularity of the Internet has given rise to
hundreds of new companies with rich backers, desperately racing to
get lots of new customers right away, even if they do not know
exactly how they will make money from them.
</P>
<P>
   Many newer start-ups look to the example of Hotmail, the first
big Web site offering free e-mail with advertising. In 18 months,
Hotmail signed up 11 million customers. And even though it never
made much selling advertising, Microsoft bought it for some $400
million.
</P>
<P>
   Timothy Draper, of the venture-capital firm of Draper Fisher
Jervetson, Hotmail's early backer, said he is so convinced that
free services are the way to build really big businesses that he
has invested in a variety of others, including free Web sites, free
disk space and free Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you believe that the Web is opening up a whole new world
economy where there will be a lot of winners, what you want to do
is back one of the 30 companies that ends up being worth a trillion
dollars,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is so sure that the way to make a trillion dollars
is to give away the most stuff free.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an unwarranted frenzy around the free model on the
internet,'' said Breyer of Accel Partners, who argues that there
just isn't enough money to be made in advertising to justify most
of these companies. ``In most cases, if one does the math, the
business assumptions simply will not hold up and the companies are
pursuing suicidal strategies.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   One site challenging that premise is Free-PC.com, which has to
sell about $30 a month in advertising to cover the costs of a
computer and Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   Donald S. La Vigne, its chief executive, maintains that the
prominent placement of the ads, in strips along two sides of the
screen, and the data the company collects observing how its
customers use the machine, will help increase sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone goes to E-Loan and four other housing sites in one
week, it's a good bet they're shopping for a mortgage,'' he said.
``Banks will pay a lot of money to find someone in the market for a
home loan.'' Still, the company will wait to see how this idea
works on 30,000 computers before it gives away more.
</P>
<P>
   The hurdle for NetZero and other companies that want to offer
free Internet service is almost as high. It costs about $10 a month
to cover the telecommunications cost of Internet access. So far the
biggest Internet service, America Online, takes in only about $5
monthly per user from ads, on top of its $22 monthly fee.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street appears to have fewer doubts. With 900,000 active
accounts, NetZero is now worth $3.2 billion, after its public
offering earlier this month. That compares to Earthlink, a big
internet servce provider with 1.5 million paying customers, that
investors value at $1.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Implicit in Wall Street's thinking is that millions of consumers
are willing to make their homes, or at least their computers, look
like the logo-covered outfield wall of a major league ballpark. So
far they are.
</P>
<P>
   ``The average consumer gets 3,000 marketing messages a day,'' La
Vigne. ``That doesn't mean they like it, but they are used to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, these Internet sites are riding a cultural shift, in
which more people embrace rather than fight commercialism.
</P>
<P>
   ``People in this generation are not as concerned with
advertising as older people,'' said Bo Peabody, 28, the founder of
Tripod, an online gathering place for Generation X now owned by
Lycos. ``We feel that everybody has an agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the sales pitch is very subtle. Onebox is a start-up
that is offering free voice mail with no visible advertising. It
hopes to profit ultimately selling a premium service linked to
people's home telephone number.
</P>
<P>
   ``It costs long distance companies $100 to $300 to get a new
customer,'' said Bill Nguyen (pronounced win), the company's
founder. ``Our free service costs less than $2 to provide. If one
person in 50 ever pays us, we will make a lot of money.''
</P>
<P>
   There are already myriad examples where free services on the
Internet are eating into lucrative markets. Five years ago, for
example, 40 percent of the revenue of Dow Jones &AMP; Co.'s online unit
came from news headlines and stock quotes it sold for 25 cents per
quote. Now hundreds of sites give those away free.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, it took two years for a company called Jfax to
attract 35,000 customers to its nifty $12-a-month service that
forwards faxes to an e-mail address. Earlier this year, a rival
called Efax introduced a service that is similar, but free, and to
date has a million customers. Jfax was forced to respond with its
own free service.
</P>
<P>
   An even higher stakes battle is occurring over Internet
auctions. EBay, the auction leader, charges a fee of 2 to 5
percent. But Yahoo is gaining ground with totally free auctions.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo is getting the same treatment in reverse in its business
that charges $100 a month and up for a business to set up a store
on the Internet. Now services like BigStep.com and FreeMerchant.com
will do all that without charge.
</P>
<P>
   Another free scheme meant to bite into Yahoo and the other
popular Internet sites is Rocketboard, acompany that hopes to give
free keyboards, with 18 extra buttons that send the user to certain
online stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``The portals now have the ocean front views, but with
Rocketboard, we are putting up a building that is closer to the
water,'' said Scott Heiferman, the company's founder.
</P>
<P>
   Where does the free frenzy end? Venture capitalists say that
entrepreneurs are now trying to raise money for everything from
free cell phones to free movies to free stock trades. But so far,
there is little inclination to give away such basic, nondigital
commodities or services as food, shelter and transportation.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end, someone has to sell something, or its all a shell
game,'' Kraus of Excite said. ``The car companies are never go to
give away free cars.''
</P>
<P>
   Or will they? Draper, the venture capitalist, said the idea may
not be as crazy as it sounds. ``It's a captive audience,'' he
remarked. ``If you control my radio while I'm driving, keep track
of where I go with a global positioning system, and maybe do
something with my cell phone, there's a possibility you might be
willing to pay $50,000 to own me for two hours a day.''
</P>
<P>
   And yes, someone has already registered the Internet address
free-cars.com.

COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY ECONOMIST WINS NOBEL PRIZE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Robert Mundell of Columbia University on Wednesday won the Nobel
Memorial Prize in economics for bringing the international economy
into Keynesian economics and vice versa in the early 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   A decade before they became everyday (and sometimes
overwhelming) facts of economic life, he introduced foreign trade,
capital movements, and currency swings into formal analysis.
</P>
<P>
   Mundell's long years during the 1970s and 1980s as a shadowy
expositor of ``supply-side'' economics and an enthusiast of the
gold standard, were overlooked by the prize committee _ or ignored.
</P>
<P>
   ``His work on monetary dynamics and optimum currency areas has
inspired generations of researchers,'' the Royal Swedish Academy of
Sciences said. ``Although dating back several decades, Mundell's
contributions remain outstanding and constitute the core of
teaching in internatioroeconomics.''
</P>
<P>
   In London on Wednesday, Mundell told the Associated Press,
``It's a measure of the respect that colleagues around the world
have for me, and I'm very pleased with that recognition.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in 1932 in Kingston, Ontario, Mundell received his
undergraduate education at the University of British Columbia and
the University of Washington. He began his graduate studies at the
London school of Economics and completed them at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, where he received his PhD in 1956. From
1961 to 1963, he served as chief economist for the International
Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   It was in the early 1960s that he published the two seminal
papers cited by the academy. In ``A Theory of Optimum Currency
Areas'' in 1961, he argued that under certain circumstances it
might not make sense for a nation to maintain its own currency. He
boldly anticipated the arguments for the European Monetary Union
and the ``dollarization'' of smaller economies around the world,
and created a framework for analyzing such decisions.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Capital Mobility and Stabilization Policy Under Fixed and
Flexible Exchange Rates'' _ published in 1963 in the relatively
obscure Canadian Journal of Economics _ he tied together a number
of previously confusing factors in an elegant but not overly formal
analysis that became known in time as the Mundell-Fleming model
(IMF economist Marcus Fleming, who developed a similar approach,
died in 1976).
</P>
<P>
   It became the workhorse for policy analysis, relating currency
swings and interest rates to fiscal and monetary policies.
</P>
<P>
   Mundell then became a key figure in the debates between the
University of Chicago and MIT. In ``Man and Economics,'' a primer
published in 1968, he began with characteristic unpredictability,
brilliance, and charm:
</P>
<P>
   ``Economics in the science of choice. It began with Aristotle
but got mixed up with ethics in the Middle Ages. Adam Smith
seperated it from ethics, and Walras mathematized it. Alfred
Marshall tried to narrow it, and Keynes made it fashionable.
Robbins widened it, and Samuelson dynamized it. But modern science
made it statistical and tried to confine it again.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the science won't stay put. It keeps cropping up all over
the place. There is an economics of money and trade, of production
and consumption, of distribution and development. There is also an
economics of welfare, of manners, language, industry, music, and
art. There is an economics of war and an economics of power. There
is even an economics of love.''
</P>
<P>
   From 1966 until 1971, Mundell was a professor at the University
of Chicago. There he matched wits with Harry Johnson, another
expositor of the monetary approach to the balance of payments, and
taught many of the best of the next generation of international
economists, including Rudiger Dornbusch, Stanley Fischer, and Jacob
Frenkel.
</P>
<P>
   At a certain point, however, he lost interest in university
life. He left Chicago for a summer job teaching in Italy. He bought
a ruined castle near Siena. He grew his hair long and rarely spoke
above a whisper.
</P>
<P>
   In Chicago he had struck up a friendship with a young assistant
professor named Arthur Laffer. They shared a fascination with the
tax cuts of President John F. Kennedy that Mundell had witnessed
during his years in Washington. Before long, they were propounding
a global view on economics in an inceasingly integrated world and a
recipe of tax cuts and tight money for stimulating economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of systematically publishing their views in scholarly
journals, however, the pair sought out policy makers and gave
newspaper interviews. Laffer took a job as chief economist at the
Office of Management and Budget in the Nixon administration.
Mundell returned to the United States and a professorship at
Columbia in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   A young newspaper editorialist for the Wall Street Journal named
Jude Wanniski ecountered the pair. The technical virtuosity of a
decade earlier was diluted until it became a curve written on a
cocktail napkin describing ``supply-side economics.''.
</P>
<P>
   After Ronald Reagan was elected president in 1980, Mundell
remained aloof from Washington, relying mainly on his friendship
with Federal Reserve chairman Paul Volcker (who had been his
opposite number at the Treasury Department during his IMF years) to
stay in touch. The ``supply-siders'' were quickly replaced by a new
generation of internationally oriented conservative economists led
by Harvard's Martin Feldstein and trained, for the most part, by
Mundell's students.
</P>
<P>
   In an early example of ``country-doctoring,'' Mundell consulted
to the Central Bank of Uruguay for a time. And in a clear signal
that he was returning to his professional responsibilities in the
early 1990s, he helped organize the American Economic Association
meetings after his old and out-of-touch Columbia colleague (and
fellow Canadian) William Vickrey was elected president. (Vickrey
died a few days after he shared the Nobel Prize a few years later.)
</P>
<P>
   Wanniski, now a political consultant and adviser to presidential
aspirant Steve Forbes, Wednesday exulted in an open letter to
Laffer, ``What great news, Art, that our boy is finally recognized
. . . ''
</P>
<P>
   Mundell told reporters he planned to use some of the prize money
(it comes to $960,000) to repair his Italian castle.

ADVERTISING: 2 HI-TECH MAGAZINES AIM TO EXPAND THEIR REACH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (bl) 
 By JANE L. LEVERE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two specialized high-technology magazines are waging
multimillion-dollar campaigns to broaden their reach.
</P>
<P>
   PC Computing, which is published by Ziff-Davis, will revamp its
content and design starting with its December issue, in part to
halt a decline in advertising pages. It is promoting these changes
to the advertisers in a campaign budgeted at more than $2 million
that will run through November.
</P>
<P>
   And Red Herring, a six-year-old, privately held magazine
focusing on the venture capital and entrepreneurial side of Silicon
Valley, is running a $5 million advertising and promotion campaign
to heighten awareness of its brand both in the general business
community and among media buyers. Besides the magazine, Red Herring
runs a Web site, Redherring.com, and a conference business.
Ziff-Davis, whose majority owner is Softbank Corp. of Japan, has an
11 percent stake in Red Herring.
</P>
<P>
   The 11-year-old PC Computing, whose readers are mostly
executives who make technology purchases, is changing the focus of
its coverage from computer products to the effect of technology on
business.
</P>
<P>
   Its new campaign, by Bigmouth, an agency in San Francisco, tries
to place PC Computing in the same category as more general interest
business magazines like Business Week, Forbes and Fortune.
</P>
<P>
   Through November, the advertising is appearing in trade
publications like Advertising Age and Adweek and through direct
mail to existing and potential advertisers. The campaign also
includes what Bigmouth calls ``rich e-mail,'' animated e-mail
accompanied by music that presents PC Computing's message to media
directors and links them to a special Web site that explains the
changes in the magazine.
</P>
<P>
   The advertising is a bold tomato red, the color of PC
Computing's logo, and the copy is somewhat cheeky. A three-page ad
running in trade publications, for example, says: ``Like Business
Week and Inc. would be, if they offered real business solutions.
Like Forbes and Wired would be, if they served some practical
purpose. The new PC Computing helps managers boost productivity,
increase profits, win new customers and, ultimately, make the cover
of one of those fancy coffee-table business books.''
</P>
<P>
   Todd Spina, the executive creative director of Bigmouth, said,
``We put up the names of the competition to put PC Computing in the
same space as Forbes, Fortune and Fast Company and to move them
away from PC World.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign for Red Herring, designed by Swirl, another agency
in San Francisco, consists of print and radio advertising that will
run through December. Some print ads, geared toward advertisers,
are appearing in trade publications. Others, intended to attract
new readers and Web site visitors, are running in The Wall Street
Journal, USA Today, The Economist, Wired and Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, four 30-second radio ads are being broadcast in
Chicago, Los Angeles, New York and San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   One print ad, created for prospective subscribers and Web site
visitors, says, ``Now that business has been turned on its head,
maybe it's time you used ours.'' Another says: ``Even leaders are
led. In today's dynamic business world, no one succeeds alone. You
need information and insight that translate into real action. You
need Red Herring.''
</P>
<P>
   Eric Roos, a partner at Swirl said, ``Everyone's jumped on the
Internet bandwagon, but Red Herring built the bandwagon.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Red Herring is not trendy,'' he added. ``It's not about hype.
It provides high-minded, clear business information as it relates
to the world of technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Linda Kopp, a senior managing editor of Simba Information, a
division of Primedia that tracks computer magazines, suggested that
Ziff-Davis was refashioning PC Computing because it had recently
lost a significant amount of advertising to general business
publications. According to Adscope in Eugene, Ore., which follows
advertising for high-technology companies, PC Computing's total ad
pages fell to 2,625 last year from 3,056 in 1995. Pages are down
almost 20 percent for the first nine months of 1999 compared with
those in the corresponding period a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``The traditional computer trade press has had a tough time of
late attracting advertising pages,'' Ms. Kopp said. ``It's natural
for them to look at how to get a piece of the pie that used to be
theirs back again.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Hiatt, who is the vice president for media services at
Blain Olsen White Gurr Advertising in Salt Lake City and the
publishing director of Mediadirector.com, a Web site for media
directors with high-technology clients, called PC Computing's ad
campaign ``a bit overstated.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But there is a story for them to tell,'' he added. ``The proof
will be in the execution, and in their ability to transcend gizmos,
PCs, how fast PCs are.''
</P>
<P>
   Sam Whitmore, editor of Mediasurvey.com, an online newsletter
that tracks technology publications, said Ziff-Davis had no choice
but to refocus PC Computing. ``They don't have a title in the
hottest part of the publishing business, which talks about new
opportunities in the Internet economy,'' he said. ``They're really
late to the game.''
</P>
<P>
   He also suggested that Red Herring needed to market itself
aggressively. If it does not, he warned, it risks ``getting its
lunch eaten by everybody from Upside to the new Time publication on
technology.''

BOOK AWARD FINALISTS ANNOUNCED  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By DINITIA SMITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Finalists were announced Wednesday for the 50th
annual National Book Awards, with the list an unusually diverse one
featuring books on subjects as varied as postwar Japan and an
American Indian girl on a remote island in Lake Superior.
</P>
<P>
   The awards will be given at a dinner on Nov. 17 at the Marriott
Marquis Hotel in Manhattan celebrating the 50th anniversary of the
prizes' sponsor, the National Book Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Among the nominees are Ha Jin, a former member of the People's
Liberation Army in China, for his novel ``Waiting'' (Pantheon),
about a man caught between the demands of two women and two worlds,
and Ai (whose real name is Florence Anthony), a poet of urban life
who is part African-American, Asian-American and Native American,
for her book ``Vice: New and Selected Poems'' (W.W. Norton).
</P>
<P>
   As is often the case, the list was as notable for the books not
included as for those that were. Not nominated was ``Dutch,'' a
highly publicized biography of Ronald Reagan by Edmund Morris that
has been criticized for mingling fact and fiction, and `` 'Tis,''
the sequel to Frank McCourt's Pulitzer Prize-winning memoir,
``Angela's Ashes.'' `` 'Tis'' has been received by critics with
less enthusiasm than the first book.
</P>
<P>
   The nominees included a winner from a previous year, Judith
Thurman, who was cited this year for her biography ``Secrets of the
Flesh: A Life of Colette'' (Alfred A. Knopf). The poet Louise
Gluck, who was a finalist in 1992, was nominated this year for
``Vita Nova: Poems'' (The Ecco Press).
</P>
<P>
   The foundation said that this year it had considered the authors
of 881 books from a record 207 publishing imprints, despite
consolidations in the book industry. Each finalist will receive a
bronze medallion and $1,000. Winners get $10,000 each and a crystal
sculpture.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Martin will be the master of ceremonies at the
foundation's 50th-anniversary gala on Nov. 17. Oprah Winfrey is
also scheduled to receive a gold medal for her contributions to
reading and to books.

PALM ANNOUNCES PARTNERSHIP TO DEVELOP CELLPHONE INTERNET STANDARD 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Forging an ambitious alliance to create a de facto
standard for wireless Internet access, the Palm Computing unit of
3Com Corp. on Wednesday announced a partnership with Symbian, a
joint venture of the wireless phone makers Nokia, Motorola,
Ericsson, Psion and Matsushita.
</P>
<P>
   The move is a serious blow to Microsoft Corp., whose Windows CE
operating system for hand-held devices has failed to make headway
against Palm Computing's Palm operating system in the United States
or Psion's Epoc operating system in Europe. Microsoft has sought to
gain support for Windows CE from cellular phone manufacturers, but
Wednesday's announcement makes it very unlikely that Windows CE
will be widely used in mobile phones anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   Nokia, the world's largest manufacturer of wireless phones, said
it would be the first to make a model combining the Palm and
Symbian operating systems. The phone is to be introduced in 2001,
first in the United States. Nokia said it would be ``pen-based,''
meaning that users would enter text by writing on its screen
surface with a stylus.
</P>
<P>
   While the new Nokia phone will use an interface similar to that
of Palm's successful hand-held digital assistants, Symbian's Epoc
operating system, originally created by Psion for its hand-held
devices, will run the phone's data communication functions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Combining Nokia's undisputed expertise in the wireless
industry and Symbian's robust and effective platform with Palm
Computing's industry-leading application environment and
user-interface strengths gives the customers the best solution in
this new product category,'' said Nokia chief executive Jorma
Ollila. .
</P>
<P>
   The alliance is Palm's first major licensing agreement since
3Com said in September it would spin off the company early next
year. Palm has already made a major foray into mobile Internet
access with its Palm VII, which offers electronic mail and limited
World Wide Web services. It also has a licensing agreement with
Qualcomm, which makes a mobile phone that doubles as a digital day
planner.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Palm said in September that it was licensing its operating
system to Handspring, a start-up company that recently released its
first Palm-based device, and to TRG, which is expected to introduce
its first product next week. Palm is increasingly looking to
license its operating system as a way to protect its market share,
especially in devices that do not compete directly with its own
products.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the alliance was a major victory for Palm in its
market war against Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great for Palm because it gives it a good footprint into
Europe and expands their licensees,'' said Michael Kleeman, an
independent telecommunications consultant in San Francisco.
Referring to Windows CE, he added: ``Any time an emerging standard
loses a potential customer, it becomes a problem. I'd be
concerned.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Reacting to news of the alliance, Jonathan Roberts, general
manager for Windows CE market development, defended the Microsoft
product at the Geneva telecommunication trade fair. ``We are
gaining greater expertise in this space,'' Roberts told Reuters.
``As you get to a richer set of services, we become more
interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   The joint venture is also a major achievement for Epoc, which
has been desperate to fend off competition from Palm and Microsoft
as it seeks to become the standard operating system for wireless
phones. The Palm alliance makes it almost certain that Epoc will be
running the underlying operations of most next-generation cellular
phones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Adding Palm computing functionality to Symbian's robust and
scalable wireless platform will result in new types of devices,
providing both Symbian and Palm developers with a compelling new
opportunity,'' said Symbian chief executive Colly Myers. .

A PERFECT JOB ON A CHILLING SUBJECT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF GUINN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This month's celebrity author: Patricia Cornwell
</P>
<P>
   Her selection: ``The Perfect Storm'' by Sebastian Junger
</P>
<P>
   ``The Perfect Storm''
</P>
<P>
   By Sebastian Junger
</P>
<P>
   Nonfiction
</P>
<P>
   HarperPaperbacks, $6.99
</P>
<P>
   Given her emphasis on research and her detailed explanations of
complicated subjects, it's no surprise that Patricia Cornwell chose
Sebastian Junger's ``The Perfect Storm'' as the featured title for
October in the ``Star-Telegram's'' monthly book club.
</P>
<P>
   ``Junger's book is nonfiction, of course, but he does such a
wonderful job of taking the reader right into the middle of it,''
says Cornwell, whose novels featuring coroner Kay Scarpetta
consistently top national bestseller lists.
</P>
<P>
   ``It,'' of course, is the so-called Halloween Gale, a murderous
storm that, in late October 1991, blew a New England fishing boat
called the Andrea Gail into a watery grave somewhere off the coast
of Sable Island in the Atlantic Ocean. All six members of the crew
were lost.
</P>
<P>
   Many other ships and crews have died tragically at sea; books
have been written about those storms and sinkings, too, but none
has had reader and sales impact like ``The Perfect Storm.'' This is
because Junger, a frequent contributing writer to several
outdoor-oriented magazines, does such a superb job of teaching
readers, in a compelling way, just how storms at sea occur and why
the Halloween Gale in particular grew into terrifying proportions
seldom experienced anywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   Junger acknowledges in his book's introduction that no one can
be certain when the Andrea Gail went down, and how its captain and
crew may have tried to get through the storm that eventually killed
them. But Junger pieces things together through extensive
interviews with the crew's relatives and friends, and by relating
the experiences of other ships and crews that endured the Halloween
Gale without being relegated to the depths of the Atlantic. We end
up caring about the captain and his crew, even when Junger makes it
obvious that no saints were on board. Combined with the author's
masterful explanation of how wind and current can join into a
killer storm, his description of how the Andrea Gail's final
moments must have been spent is both horrifying and riveting; as
Cornwell says, you really can't put the book down.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Junger gets down to what had to have happened at the
end: how people drown.
</P>
<P>
   His descriptions of lungs full of seawater, of how the brain
fights to keep the body alive even when the mind has accepted
imminent death, are terrifyingly classic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an easy way to die, not as painful as we might think it
is,'' says Cornwell, who worked in a coroner's office before
embarking on a full-time writing career. ``Junger captures that so
well; it's one of the most brilliant passages I've ever read.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the massive success of ``The Perfect Storm'' _ the book
spent six months on various bestseller lists _ publishers have
flocked to follow it with other titles about natural disasters.
Readers, it seems, are fascinated by the power of nature.
</P>
<P>
   But no matter how many eminently readable copycat titles follow
it, Sebastian Junger's ``The Perfect Storm'' will probably be
remembered as the perfect book describing how the sea can overcome
human technology. We can invent all the wonderful boats and
superior onboard equipment we like; the sea is still all-powerful.

 &HT;    Monsoon was a gorilla inside the ring, pussycat outside
 &HT;    By John Allen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When it comes to old-school wrestling, very few names
are more recognizable than that of Gorilla Monsoon. On Oct. 6,
Gorilla Monsoon, 62, died at his home in Willingboro, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   In the world of wrestling, few have done more for longer than
Monsoon _ real name Bob Marella. He was a wrestler, announcer and
president of wrestling organizations for nearly 40 years. For
generations of wrestling fans Monsoon was either a scary wrestler,
or a bumbling announcer, or a legendary figure in pro wrestling.
</P>
<P>
   When Monsoon was Marella, he was a Rochester, N.Y., high school
star in football, wrestling and track and field. He went to Ithaca
(N.Y.) College, where he placed second in the 1959 NCAA national
wrestling championship. He still holds the school record for
fastest pin by a heavyweight. After school he was thinking of
joining the NFL but was approached by western New York promoter
Pedro Martinez. Marella made his in-ring debut at the Rochester War
Memorial in 1959 and won. But it wasn't until 1963 that Marella
became Gorilla Monsoon.
</P>
<P>
   Monsoon's story line was that he was being raised by a gypsy in
Manchuria. After years of hard work and being forced to wrestle
bears for other people's entertainment, he left for America, where
he ate raw meat and drank the blood of his opponents.
</P>
<P>
   The gimmick worked as Monsoon was one of the most feared and
hated heels of the '60s and '70s.
</P>
<P>
   But for many he was the prototypical gentle giant.
</P>
<P>
   I had the opportunity to meet Marella twice while attending
Ithaca College. He would stop by whenever he was in the area and
was very different from his in-ring persona. He was always smiling
and made people around him feel important.
</P>
<P>
   Pro athletes today could learn a lot from Marella. He performed
in pain, gave the fans a show and was extremely approachable, which
probably came from the fact he didn't take his job as seriously as
the fans in the stands did.
</P>
<P>
   After his in-ring career, Monsoon became an announcer famous for
making up body parts while describing wrestling moves. Eventually
he stepped away from the traveling grind and was semi-retired.
</P>
<P>
   Heart problems plagued Marella, who weighed around 400 pounds
during his wrestling career. A second heart attack eventually sent
him home, where he died with his family by his side.
</P>
<P>
   A quiet ending for a Monsoon.

 &HT;    Monday show proves why fans kept organization at the top of the
wrestling pile
 &HT;    By Lyle V. Harris
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Popcorn, profanity, and flop sweat ruled the night as
35,000 wrestling fans packed the Georgia Dome for a ringside seat
at the biggest and baddest show on cable television _ the World
Wrestling Federation's ``Raw is War.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday's live show and telecast took on added significance
because it was staged in the hometown of World Championship
Wrestling, the rival organization whose prime-time show ``Monday
Nitro'' on TNT has been getting a drubbing from WWF in the Nielsen
ratings.
</P>
<P>
   Just moments after Monday night's shunder way, it became
clear that ``Raw'' would live up to its name.
</P>
<P>
   Bald-headed anti-hero ``Stone Cold'' Steve Austin entered the
ring, grabbed a microphone and explained to his screaming fans how
he planned to defeat his WWF nemesis, Triple H. His description and
the crowd's reaction involved several unprintable derivations
involving the human posterior.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just love Steve Austin,'' yelled Maria Walker, a warehouse
supervisor who was so excited by the show that she left her two
sons sitting alone two rows back. ``I'm not even sure what he said,
but it doesn't matter because he's Stone Cold.''
</P>
<P>
   As the crowd roared its approval, Austin showed his affection by
leaping on the ring ropes and flashing his patented two-fisted,
middle-finger salute, which made his fans cheer even louder.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Anderson, a 17-year-old high school student, said WWF has
been a hit with wrestling fans because their performers are younger
and their story lines are more outrageous and unpredictable.
</P>
<P>
   ``WWF makes you feel what's in the wrestlers' hearts,'' said
Anderson, who added he never watches the WCW show on television.
``They're more fun to watch than WCW. If you don't like violence
and cursing, you shouldn't come and you shouldn't watch.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, WWF started whipping WCW in the ratings race, and
their dominance has continued unabated. WWF's Monday night show
``Raw is War'' has been the top-rated cable show on television
since January.
</P>
<P>
   While WWF has become the gold standard for professional
wrestling lately, it has had its share of triumphs and tragedies.
The WWF's profile got a boost after former grappler Jesse ``The
Body'' Ventura was elected governor of Minnesota. Since then
Ventura has participated in WWF bouts, serving as a referee during
one pay-per-view event.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the WWF announced it would issue an initial public
offering that is expected to raise $172 million.
</P>
<P>
   But the WWF took a serious body blow in May when wrestler Owen
Hart fell 78 feet to his death as he was being lowered into the
ring at an event at the Kemper Arena in Kansas City. Hart's family
is suing the organization in connection with the incident.
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to cut into their competitor's ratings edge, WCW
recently hired Vince Russo and Ed Ferrara, writers who are credited
with creating the outrageous characters and story lines that have
been a hit with viewers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Give us a little time and we will be back on top,'' says Alan
Sharp, a WCW spokesman. ``We will do that by depending on more
creative stories, superior athleticism and better TV production.
You can be creative without resorting to shock TV.''
</P>
<P>
   Russo and Ferrara were unavailable for comment, but during a
chat session last Tuesday on the WCW web site, they hinted at some
of the changes they had in mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is that controversy is our middle name,''
Russo told a caller. ``If there's not controversy, we ain't happy.
We're going to get away with whatever they allow us to get away
with.'' Russo added that one of the innovations they are
considering is a ``Jell-O battle royal'' involving the WCW Nitro
Girls, a group of scantily clad dancers.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Schwarz, a spokesman for the USA Network in New York,
downplayed the significance of Russo and Ferrara jumping ship.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys worked with Vince McMahon; he's the guy,'' Schwarz
said. ``We're confident that he will bring on more folks who will
continue to come up with new stories and characters that wrestling
viewers will want to watch.''

   Doster, 35, didn't care about the behind-the-scenes
wrangling between the WCW and the WWF. And as she sat demurely in
the crowd Monday night, she didn't seem fazed by the bulging
spandex, foul language and testosterone-stoked fans. In her line of
work, it comes with the job.

   ``This is no big deal _ people are just having a good time,''
said Doster, who works as a dancer for an Atlanta strip club.
``People sometimes get a little adrenaline rush.''

STUDY FINDS RACIAL GAP IN LUNG CANCER OPERATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   U.S. surgeons operate less often on African-Americans with
early-stage lung cancer than on comparable white patients, a
disparity that mostly explains higher death rates among blacks with
potentially curable lung tumors.
</P>
<P>
   A new study documents the treatment gap, providing the most
compelling evidence so far that widespread and inexplicable racial
differences in medical care result in thousands of avoidable
deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier studies had pointed to racial disparities in treatment,
but many of them involved procedures with debatable effects on
survival, such as coronary bypass surgery. However, nobody
disagrees that surgery to remove early-stage lung cancers offers
the only chance at a cure.
</P>
<P>
   ``If black patients were to undergo surgery at a rate equal to
that of white patients, their survival rate would probably be
substantially improved and would approach that of white patients,''
the study's authors said in their report, which appears in this
week's New England Journal of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the study may understate racial inequalities in lung
cancer treatment because it involved only patients who had enough
access to health care to receive an early diagnosis. Other data
show that blacks are more likely to get lung cancer and less likely
to be diagnosed at an early stage.
</P>
<P>
   The findings elicited strong reactions.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence of bias among physicians, subconscious or not, is
``disheartening because we all believe that if our loved ones get
cancer, they will receive the best care possible,'' wrote Dr.
Talmadge E. King Jr. and Dr. Paul Brunetta of the University of
California at San Francisco, in an editorial accompanying the
study.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier studies showed that black Medicare beneficiaries,
compared to whites, undergo fewer than half as many heart bypass
operations or artery-opening angioplasty procedures. Black women
have 25 percent fewer mammograms than white women, and
African-American Medicare recipients overall have 16 percent higher
mortality rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``The data is coming from so many sources that it is hard even
with the best of conscience not to think that race is the factor,
be it conscious or unconscious,'' Dr. Walter W. Shervington of New
Orleans told the Associated Press. Shervington is president of the
National Medical Association, an organization of 20,000 black
doctors.
</P>
<P>
   However, a separate study, by the California-based Kaiser Family
Foundation, found that two-thirds of white Americans believe that
African-Americans are ``just as well or better off than the average
white person when it comes to getting routine medical care when
they need it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kaiser survey, based on a national poll of nearly 3,400
Americans, found that 51 percent of African-Americans believe
blacks are worse off when it comes to medical care.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Peter Bach of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New
York, who led the new cancer study, was careful not to accuse
doctors of racism. ``I'm not convinced that I understand what's
going on,'' Bach said, saying further research is needed on such
questions as whether doctors are offering blacks surgery less
often, how they present patients' options, and whether black
patients have undue pessimism or cultural beliefs that incline them
against surgery for lung cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Bach and his colleagues at Sloan-Kettering and the National
Cancer Institute extracted their conclusion from nearly 11,000 lung
cancer patients over age 65 with potentially curable stage I and II
disease in five metropolitan areas and five entire states. All the
patients had so-called nonsmall cell cancer, which accounts for 70
percent of lung malignancies.
</P>
<P>
   Among the 170,000 Americans who receive lung cancer diagnoses
each year _ more than for any other malignancy _ about 34,000 are
diagnosed with nonsmall cell lung cancer early enough for surgeons
to aim for cure. Among those who get surgery at such a stage, 40
percent will be alive and free of disease five years later.
</P>
<P>
   If the new results were applied to two groups of 1,000 patients
with early-stage lung cancer _ one white and one black _ the
researchers said that 767 white patients would get surgery compared
to 640 blacks. At the end of five years, 341 white patients would
be alive versus 264 blacks.
</P>
<P>
   Most of these 77 additional black deaths can be blamed on the
decision not to operate, according to Bach. ``We think we have
identified more than half of the explanation for why there's a
gap,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Other factors besides lower surgical rates contributing to
higher mortality among African-Americans with lung cancer, Bach
said, include a generally lower life expectancy among blacks and
``other things that are probably not related to lung cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   One implication of the findings is that large improvements in
blacks' lung cancer survival rates could be made by applying
existing treatments.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a reason for optimism here,'' Bach said. ``We think
we've identified a group of patients who could substantially
benefit with a treatment of known efficacy.''

   Biggest rumor this week is that Hulk Hogan is quitting WCW. All
week leading up to Monday's ``Nitro'' in Biloxi, Miss., rumors
circulated that Hogan had exercised his 90-day release clause.
After the ``Nitro'' show, in which Hogan hinted that he wasn't
going to be leaving right away but he wasn't happy with the current
situation, WCW Live reporters Bob Ryder and Mark Madden said Hogan
gave his notice two weeks ago and exercised his out clause. The
reason for Hogan's decision could stem from WCW's decision to hire
the main creative team behind the WWF's raunchy story lines _ Vince
Russo and Ed Ferrara. The duo joined the struggling WCW and have
been given free rein to set the organization on its ear, which
presumably means less of the older wrestlers like Hogan and more of
the younger wrestlers like Chris Benoit. That does not sit well
with Hogan, who has forced his way to be the main event since
joining the WCW after being out of wrestling for a year. While
battling the WCW for ratings, Russo and Ferrara have taken less
well-known talent and made stars such as Steve Austin, Triple H and
The Rock. They hope to do the same in the WCW with wrestlers like
Benoit, Kidman, Disco Inferno, Eddy Guerrero and Buff Bagwell. That
could change the product and leave less of a role for
headed-over-the-hill stars such as Hogan, Ric Flair, Bret Hart and
Macho Man Randy Savage. The duo will take over creative control the
day after the Oct. 24 ``Halloween Havoc'' pay-per-view. It's
interesting to note that while WCW has pushed Goldberg since Eric
Bischoff's ouster, Russo and Ferrara have not mentioned Goldberg as
one of the top young talents in the WCW.
</P>
<P>
   _ The WWF had another tragedy last week when Droz broke his neck
and was paralyzed after falling the wrong way after a move by
wrestler D'Lo Brown. A week later, the 30-year-old former NFL
player was still in the hospital and getting feeling back in
different parts of his body.
</P>
<P>
   _ It looks like Ken Shamrock's wrestling career is over. He will
not need surgery on his neck, but he has been advised to stay out
of the ring.
</P>
<P>
   _ WCW had a return to ``Old School'' on the Oct. 4 ``Nitro.''
Bret Hart's return to Kemper Arena, where his brother Owen was
killed this year, was highlighted by the longest match in ``Nitro''
history (over 27 minutes). Hart vs. Benoit was Bret's idea, even
though WCW offered him the chance not to even have to show at
Kemper. But Bret wanted it and wanted an old-style NWA match and
originally wanted Benoit to win. Creative forces changed the
ending, thinking the fans would rather see a Hart victory.
</P>
<P>
   _ Speaking of Owen Hart, A&AMP;E expects to air a special biography
on the wrestler Nov. 16 at 8 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   _ WCW's woes at the gate continue. Last week's ``Saturday
Night'' taping drew only 500 paying fans. Meanwhile, buy rate for
the ``Fall Brawl'' pay-per-view was a dismal .23, which is less
than 100,000 purchases. ECW's recent ``Anarchy Rulz'' topped that.
Last year's ``Fall Brawl'' had over 250,000 purchases.
</P>
<P>
   _ The main event is set for the WCW ``Mayhem'' pay-per-view Nov.
21 in Toronto. Bret Hart will take on the winner of the Sting-Hulk
Hogan match from ``Halloween Havoc.''
</P>
<P>
   _ The WWF has not been happy with the performances of two former
WCW wrestlers _ The Big Show and Chris Jericho. Both may continue
their fall down the low-to-mid-card status until they get more over
with the fans.
</P>
<P>
   _ Announcer Mean Gene Okerlund has re-signed with the WCW for
three more years.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sting is asking WCW officials to let him turn face. He doesn't
feel the fans are buying him as a heel.

<P>
   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras _ The bus from Boulevard Suyapa had barely
pulled to a stop when Heriberto Herrera jumped off and began his
way to work through a wearying and familiar maze. First he walked a
block to La Isla bridge, which crosses the Rio Chiquito, a slender
river whose churning currents are the color of milk chocolate. Then
he squeezed past dozens of sidewalk vendors selling everything from
toothpaste to lottery tickets, sometimes stepping out onto the road
and gingerly dodging a steady caravan of cabs and sedans. Then he
walked some more. Uphill.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, after winds and floods from Hurricane Mitch damaged
scores of bridges throughout Honduras, buses were banned from
crossing the spans linking Tegucigalpa's outlying neighborhoods to
its historic center and thousands of people were forced to make
walking part of their daily and extended commute. People who had to
go from one end of the city to another suddenly confronted the
vexing reality of two-fare zones, since they had to get off one
bus, walk through downtown, then pay to board another bus. Nearly a
year later, the bus ban and the ensuing frustrating routine remain
in effect.
</P>
<P>
   Herrera, a typographer, said he resents the fact that after a
nation-battering catastrophe like ``El Mitch,'' the government has
created more hardships for the throngs of poor and working-class
bus riders while continuing to cater to the relatively fortunate
few with the time or money for cabs or cars that carry only a
handful of passengers each.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say the bridges are no good, but that's a lie,'' Herrera
said, watching as taxis and private cars crept over the bridge at
La Isla. ``Even before Hurricane Mitch they wanted to stop the
routes at the edge to protect the millionaires. The millionaires
have their own cars. But those of us who work in the center have to
walk.''
</P>
<P>
   His gripes were not off base, because although the capital's
bridges have been deemed largely safe, city officials have no
intentions of letting the buses back in. In fact, the emergency
measures taken after the hurricane allowed city officials to carry
out long-standing plans to bar buses from the central district's
incredibly congested and narrow streets, which were laid out during
the horse and buggy era.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you stop in the center of the capital at any hour, even
without the buses the traffic cannot move,'' said Nany de Flores, a
spokeswoman for the mayor of Tegucigalpa. ``The fleet of taxis has
grown from 2,500 to 6,000 since Mitch. It is a total block without
the buses. The day the buses enter the center, the city would be
paralyzed.''
</P>
<P>
   But Adrian Matamoros, an electrician who now spends twice as
much time and money for his commute, wonders about another kind of
paralysis, namely the fear that old people or women with children
must face as they walk through packed streets by day or darkened
sidewalks at night.
</P>
<P>
   ``A neighbor of mine was walking in the street with her child
and she was almost hit by a car,'' he said. ``I heard of other
people having their earrings or watches stolen. Before, when the
buses went through the center of the city you did not have that
problem. You could go from one side of the city to the other
without getting off.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many people, he has to leave an hour earlier if he wants to
get anywhere on time. Some take it, well, in stride.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me it's good,'' said Ruben Martinez, a retired translator.
``I'm old and I need the exercise.''
</P>
<P>
   He then lighted a cigarette and began his walk into town.
</P>
<P>
   However, there's nothing good about paying double, which is what
Idalia Euraque has to do to get to her job at a downtown archive.
She's usually late getting to work and coming home. Still, she
agreed that the buses should not cross the bridges.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say the pavement is weak,'' she said, pointing to the
Puente Mallol, which connects the market area in Comayaguela with
Tegucigalpa. ``Look at this pavement, the asphalt is almost gone.
It is pure stone.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the capital has fared better than other parts of the
country, where public works officials say 128 bridges were knocked
out by the hurricane, affecting some 70 percent of the road
network. With the cost of rebuilding estimated at more than $450
million, most places will have to make do with temporary metal or
culvert bridges. In some parts of the country, people have to walk
over trees that have been laid across rivers.
</P>
<P>
   Several new bridges are planned for Tegucigalpa, as well as yet
another rerouting of buses. Yet despite the numbers and needs of
commuters, no officials are suggesting what mass transportation
advocates have long urged in other countries: banning private cars
from downtown rather than buses.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we cannot go into the city, why should private cars?'' said
Jose Maldonado, a bus driver taking a break. ``The buses are for
the poor. I have been in 10 countries and that's how it is. They
leave the cars outside of the center and let the buses pass. Here,
it's the reverse.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials said they were planning a campaign to encourage people
to park their cars near the downtown bridges. Already, heavy trucks
are limited to making deliveries only between 6 p.m. and 7 a.m.
Officials are also collaborating with French consultants on
building bus stops closer to the bridges, on land reclaimed from
the riverbanks with stairs leading up to the bridge entrances _
from which they would walk into town.
</P>
<P>
   That's fine with street vendors like Jorge Anaribe, who sells
shorts and shirts from a blanket he spreads on the sidewalk leading
to La Isla bridge.
</P>
<P>
   Since the ban on bus crossings took effect, he said, his sales
have increased tenfold.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me it's good because everybody has to get off the bus,''
he said. ``Before, the buses passed by on their way to the center
and that hurt my sales.''
</P>
<P>
   About the only thing that hurts him now is the rain. Farther
down the street, Romulo Isaias was ready for anything. On hot days
he sells water. On rainy days he sells umbrellas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have everything,'' he said. ``You are born to die. So while
you live, you work.''
</P>
<P>
   And watch the people walk on by.

PRESCRIPTION DRUG COVERAGE NOT AMONG MEDICARE INCREASES PROPOSED BY
REPUBLICANS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Senior Republicans in Congress proposed Wednesday
to restore some of the money they cut from Medicare in 1997, but
they said they had no plans to provide prescription drug benefits
to the elderly this year.
</P>
<P>
   Under immense pressure from the health care industry, the
Republican lawmakers said they would soon pass legislation to
increase Medicare payments to hospitals, nursing homes, outpatient
clinics, home health care agencies, doctors and health maintenance
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   But they said they did not have enough time this year to address
the top priority of many elderly people: Medicare coverage of
prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   On June 29, Clinton unveiled an ambitious plan to redesign
Medicare. Drug benefits for the elderly were the keystone of that
plan. Overall, the plan was the most significant health care
proposal advanced by the president since Congress rejected his plan
to guarantee health insurance for all Americans in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Jennings, the health policy coordinator at the White
House, said Wednesday night: ``The president certainly would have
preferred to do broader reforms in the Medicare program, including
prescription drug benefits, this year. He is not giving up. He will
continue to work with Congress to achieve that goal.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill Thomas, R-Calif., who is chairman of the House Ways
and Means Subcommittee on Health, said he had ruled out new
initiatives this year and was trying only to solve problems created
by the last big budget-cutting law, the Balanced Budget Act of
1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of our basic principles was `no new starts,''' Thomas said
in announcing his proposals Wednesday. ``Pretty obviously
prescription drugs are an important benefit that needs to be added
in the context of overall reform of Medicare.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, such changes will have to wait till next year.
</P>
<P>
   The Medicare proposals were unveiled separately by Thomas and
Sen. William Roth Jr., R-Del., who is chairman of the Senate
Finance Committee. Neither man said how he would pay for his
proposals, other than by using some of the federal budget surplus.
</P>
<P>
   Lobbyists for nursing homes and home health agencies said they
liked the House proposals better than the Senate proposals. But
teaching hospitals strongly prefer the Senate proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York, the ranking Democrat
on the Finance Committee, was a co-author of the Senate proposals.
Moynihan's concerns were reflected in a proposal to provide
teaching hospitals with a big infusion of Medicare money.
</P>
<P>
   In restoring money cut from Medicare in 1997, the House and
Senate bills both go further than Clinton has proposed.
Administration officials have been clear on the question of whether
the 1997 cuts are harming hospitals and other health care
providers, as the industry contends.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference on July 21, Clinton said, ``The cuts in
Medicare were far more severe'' than he or Congress expected.
``That's why you've got all these hospitals all over America, every
place I go, talking about how they are threatened with
bankruptcy,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   But the president's comments have not been translated into
action by his administration. Officials at the White House Office
of Management and Budget and the Federal Health Care Financing
Administration, which runs Medicare, say that the financial
problems of hospitals and nursing homes have been caused by many
factors other than Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   The 1997 law cut the growth of Medicare by $115 billion over
five years. Thomas' proposals would restore $15 billion over five
years. Roth's plan would restore $12 billion to $14 billion over 10
years. The Clinton administration has proposed restoring $7.5
billion over 10 years. Sen. Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the
Democratic floor leader, has introduced a bill to restore $20
billion over 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas said the president could take action on his own to soften
the impact of the 1997 cuts. House Republicans are prodding Clinton
to restore $5.6 billion to Medicare through more generous
interpretations of the law, without action by Congress. That sum
accounts for more than one-third of the $15 billion that House
Republicans want to see restored to Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth E. Raske, president of the Greater New York Hospital
Association, welcomed the Senate proposal. Congressional aides said
Thomas' plan would provide teaching hospitals with $300 million to
$500 million over five years, while the Roth-Moynihan proposal
would provide $2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clear that the hue and cry from teaching hospitals is
being heard by the Senate Finance Committee,'' Raske said. ``The
Roth-Moynihan proposal could hold off the pain and bloodletting
that would otherwise occur as a result of the Balanced Budget Act.
Under the Senate proposal, there would be no further erosion of
medical education payments over the next four years.''
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Medicare beneficiaries say that one of the most troublesome
features of the 1997 law is a set of limits on the therapy services
they can receive under Medicare. The government will pay no more
than $1,500 a year for physical therapy and $1,500 for occupational
and speech therapy combined.
</P>
<P>
   Roth would replace these limits with a ceiling of $3,500 a year
for all three types of therapy. Thomas would allow a combined total
of $4,500 a year in therapy services, with $1,500 for each of the
three categories. In addition, under Thomas' proposal, 1 percent of
patients receiving therapy _ the sickest patients with the most
severe needs _ would be exempted from the limits.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Keegan, vice president of the American Health Care
Association, which represents 12,000 nursing homes, said the Thomas
proposals were more helpful than the Roth proposals, which she
described as ``wholly inadequate.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the Balanced Budget Act, Medicare payments to home health
agencies will be cut by 15 percent in October next year, just as
the government is scheduled to adopt a new reimbursement formula.
Thomas would re-examine the need for the cut and would delay it by
at least one year. Under Roth's proposal, the 15 percent cut would
take effect gradually over three years.
</P>
<P>
   Mara Benner, executive director of a trade group, the Home
Health Services and Staffing Association, said Thomas' proposal was
much better than Roth's proposal, which she said would provide only
``minimal help'' to home health agencies. Her group represents
1,500 such agencies.

COMMENTARY: GORE HAS IT MADE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By BOB HERBERT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The thing is, Al Gore should be _ even now, even with
all the trouble he's seen, the jokes he's spawned, the missteps
he's made _ unbeatable in the race for the Democratic nomination
for president. Even with his campaign limping embarrassingly along,
he should be able to beat Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   He's got Big Labor behind him. He's got hundreds of
superdelegates _ party chieftains and other assorted big shots _
already committed to him, with hundreds more ready to get on board.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats have scrapped the winner-take-all primaries and
gone to a system of proportional representation. So even if Gore
loses some key states to Bradley, the vice president would still
pick up a substantial number of delegates from those states.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has the advantage in California at the moment, and he'll
certainly do well in the South. So it would seem virtually
impossible for Bradley to prevent Gore from accumulating the 2,167
delegates he needs to secure the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, the smart money will tell you that Bill Bradley is
peaking too soon, that he was better off as the stealth candidate,
hoarding his money and keeping expectations as low as possible for
as long as possible. The spotlight found him three or four months
too early. The barbarians in the media are ready to pounce.
</P>
<P>
   But if all of this is such bad news for Bradley, why are so many
Gore supporters so ill at ease?
</P>
<P>
   There is a very dangerous divide developing for the Democrats as
the primary season approaches. Al Gore has just about locked up the
official support. He's been endorsed by more than 100 members of
Congress and by Democratic officeholders from coast to coast. He is
the candidate of the Democratic establishment. He's already won
that primary.
</P>
<P>
   But the voters are another matter. Gore is not connecting with
the people and time is running out.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president's supporters insist it will be awfully tough,
no matter what happens, for Bradley to steal the nomination. But
they are speaking openly, if not always for attribution, about
their dismay at seeing Gore struggling day after day to establish a
reasonably comfortable relationship with potential voters, the kind
of ordinary rapport that is second nature to most politicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's painful to watch,'' said one aide. ``It's like he was
born without the ability to be spontaneous. He's trying so hard,
but it's not working.''
</P>
<P>
   More bad news came Wednesday when a poll in Connecticut, thought
by Gore's people to be friendly turf, showed Bradley leading the
vice president by 51 to 34 percent. The poll was conducted by
Quinnipiac College. A similar poll in June showed the vice
president ahead of Bradley by 47 to 37 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In private conversations, several top Gore supporters said they
didn't think Bradley would win the nomination, but they could
imagine a scenario in which he might. One key aide put Bradley's
chances at 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley would have to use the early primaries, concentrated in
the Northeast, as a springboard. New Hampshire's primary is Feb. 1.
Then, on March 7, come New York, California, Maine, Vermont,
Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, Maryland, Georgia, Ohio
and Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's people say they expect the vice president to do well in
those primaries, but even if he doesn't they are building a
``firewall'' in the South. On March 14 there are primaries in
Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, Gore's home state of Tennessee,
Texas, Oklahoma and Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   The danger for Gore is that if he does not find a way to begin
connecting with voters, Bradley may change the whole dynamic of the
race before the Southern primaries come into play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Say Bradley does well in the Northeast,'' said Lee Miringoff,
director of the Marist College Institute for Public Opinion in
Poughkeepsie. ``And say the bookends topple, with Gore losing both
New York and California. That would be a cataclysmic, defining
event. The question on the news would be, `How can Gore win the
nomination?'''
</P>
<P>
   That's the best-case scenario for Bradley. The worst-case
scenario for Democrats is that Gore hangs on and wins the
nomination, but never finds that real connection with the voters.

COMMENTARY: THE YEAR OF DEBATES 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the coming year, with no White House incumbent
to vote for or against, we'll be basing our nomination and election
decisions largely on how candidates impress us in the televised
debates.
</P>
<P>
   The first match-up will be the Democrats Gore vs. Bradley.
Front-runners are usually reluctant to debate, for good reason: It
gives challengers an audience. Because the front-runner, Al Gore,
now knows he is in a scrap and is eager to appear the underdog, the
newly energized vice president has already challenged Bill Bradley
to a series of debates.
</P>
<P>
   The cool former senator is in no hurry to engage. He runs by his
own internal clock and pays no mind to either the importuning of
the press for specific positions or the call from Gore to respond
to his revitalization needs. In a month, however, after his
necessary foreign policy address to some New York forum, ducking
debate would make him appear weak or arrogant, and Bradley will
accede to popular demand for a series of televised confrontations.
</P>
<P>
   Gore will enter as the favorite, because he is famed for
trouncing Ross Perot and Jack Kemp in past debates (though he was
fought to a standstill by Dan Quayle). He will carry the fight to
Bradley, taunting him for ``quitting'' the progressive cause in its
hour of need to combat the Gingrich Congress; for timorously voting
against the war to contain Saddam Hussein, and for being nowhere
near the bridge during the ``Clinton-Gore'' prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley will surprise : noncombative but giving no quarter, he
will project a gentle strength and present a low-key disdain for
the usual political point-making. He will keep changing the subject
to race relations (seeking out a Clinton source of strength) and to
a need for the rebirth of decency (offering Democrats escape from
Clinton guilt).
</P>
<P>
   Who will win? First, the Democratic Party will. These are two
serious, experienced and intelligent candidates, neither of whom
wants to appear personally to be out to clobber the other and
thereby sow division in the ranks.
</P>
<P>
   In debate, Gore is likely to win on points; he not only knows
his stuff but is trained in how to slam it home. Bradley is likely
to win on general impression; he's a new face to most viewers,
good-humored and likable, talks dull but hangs loose, and fits in
his skin. In a nomination fight, points count; in a general
election, impression is all. Victory in the Gore-Bradley debates
will be measured by who gains most against the Republican
front-runner.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush, with the most now to lose, can be expected to
resist pre-nomination debate as long as possible. Lest this make
him seem fearful or unprepared, he will agree to a single debate
early next year with as many other Republican candidates as can be
rounded up. He would be the moderate, gamely suffering the arrows
of Steve Forbes and Gary Bauer, free in that format from the need
to expound in detail, stressing winnability.
</P>
<P>
   Senator John McCain has now broken out of the pack in New
Hampshire polls to become the viable Bush alternative. He has found
his villain _ ``the special interests'' in both parties trading
campaign money for legislative favor _ and is winning independents.
If McCain shakes up Bush in New Hampshire, the public pressure will
be intense for a one-on-one debate before the March 7 New York and
California primaries.
</P>
<P>
   With Bush in Clintonesque triangulation and McCain in
Trumanesque populism, that would be fun: two guys running against
their party for its nomination. Who'd win that debate? Despite
having done well debating Ann Richards in Texas (and let's see that
on C-Span), Bush would have the advantage of low expectations
against the feisty McCain.
</P>
<P>
   In the general election, neither major party will repeat the
1992 mistake of giving a huge audience to a third candidate,
especially from a party now giving ``lunatic fringe'' a bad name.
</P>
<P>
   So: Which Democrat, hard-hitting Gore or intellectual Bradley,
would be more likely to savage Bush in debate if he is still ahead?
Put another way: Which Republican, maverick McCain or moderate
Bush, would be more effective in stopping the momentum of the
victor of the exciting Democratic debates?
</P>
<P>
   For a guide to the Main Event, we have to watch the prelims.

IN FIRST, WOMAN TO HEAD TOP COURT IN MASS. 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL REZENDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Margaret H. Marshall was confirmed yesterday as chief
justice of the Massachusetts Supreme Judical Court, making her the
first woman to lead the state's judiciary or any of the three
branches of Massachusetts government.
</P>
<P>
   Governor Paul Cellucci, who has stood by his nominee in the face
of criticism from Cardinal Bernard F. Law and abortion-rights
opponents, Wednesday hailed Marshall as a leader of ``great
character'' and repeated his contention that her opponents on the
Governor's Council were motivated by sexism.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time in the history of Massachusetts we have a
woman leading one of the branches of state government,'' Cellucci
said. ``Margaret Marshall has a great intellect, she's a woman of
great character, and she will be a great Supreme Court chief
justice.''
</P>
<P>
   The eight members of the council and Lieutenant Governor Jane
Swift voted 6-3 to confirm Marshall. One councilor said she was not
sufficiently qualified for the post, and another said she had been
unfairly attacked by abortion rights opponents.
</P>
<P>
   The Council also voted 9-0 to confirm Superior Court Judge
Judith A. Cowin as an associate justice of the high court. Law had
also raised questions about Cowin's nomination, but councilors who
reviewed her ruling in a discrimination case against the
Catholic-affiliated Carney Hospital in Boston, said they were
convinced she did not exhibit an anti-Catholic bias.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on her record as a whole, I am persuaded that the text
of one decision called into question did not reflect a bigoted
mindset that would disqualify her from confirmation,'' said
Councilor Edward M. O'Brien, an Easthampton Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien led the opposition to Marshall's nomination as chief
justice, asserting that her comparatively short tenure of two years
and nine months on the high court, coupled with a lack of previous
judicial experience, should disqualify her from the position.
</P>
<P>
   The chief justice manages the activities of the SJC, assigning
judges to write opinions on specific cases, serving as the liaison
to the governor and Legislature, and helping to oversee operation
of the lower courts.
</P>
<P>
   ``At no time in the history of the court has any governor named
a chief justice who has had less experience as a member of the
court system,'' O'Brien said.
</P>
<P>
   Councilor Michael J. Callahan, a Medford Democrat, said he voted
against Marshall's confirmation because of her relatively brief
tenure as a judge, while Councilor David Francis Constantine, a New
Bedford Democrat, said he opposed Marshall in part because she did
not recuse herself from an abortion-related lawsuit after serving
on the board of a home for unwed mothers that performs the
procedure.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one can tell me this is the best candidate for the
position,'' said Constantine, who cast the sole vote against
Marshall's confirmation as an associate justice three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Marshall nor Cowin was on hand to witness Wednesday's
confirmation vote. In a prepared statement, Marshall said: ``I am
honored, deeply honored, by the vote of confirmation of my
nomination as Chief Justice. . . . I follow in the footsteps of
giants. I do so with humility and with a deep commitment to the
rule of law.''
</P>
<P>
   Marshall, 55, the wife of New York Times columnist Anthony
Lewis, was a student leader who opposed apartheid in her South
African homeland before immigrating to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her beliefs were tested when it was a dangerous thing to stand
up,'' said Cellucci. ``I think that kind of person leading one of
our branches of state government is a wonderful thing.''
</P>
<P>
   For Cellucci, Wednesday's confirmation votes helped define the
extradinary role he is playing in reshaping the high court. With
Supreme Court justices Ruth I. Abrams and Neil L. Lynch facing
mandatory retirement next year, Cellucci is on a course to have
appointed four of the high court's seven judges and named its chief
justice in a single gubernatorial term.
</P>
<P>
   In addition elevating Marshall and naming Cowin, Celluci
recently named Judge Francis X. Spina to the high court.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking for judges who have a respect for our democratic
system, respect for the legislature and respect for the people,''
Cellucci said, adding that judges in his view should uphold the
law, not make the law.
</P>
<P>
   The Marshall and Cowin nominations erupted in controversy last
month when Law said in a letter to Cellucci that each of the
nominees had taken actions that showed ``a certain mindset which at
times is open to the serious charge of anti-Catholicism.''
</P>
<P>
   In Marshall's case, Law objected to an action she had taken as
chief legal counsel at Harvard University, when she admonished
noted Catholic intellectural Mary Ann Glendon for using Harvard Law
School stationery for a letter to Catholic priests that discussed
opposition to federal abortion-rights legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Law, after speaking directly with Marshall, dropped his
objections to her nomination but abortion rights opponents
continued to oppose her elevaton to chief justice.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts Citizens For Life, the largest organization in the
state opposing abortion rights, charged Marshall violated the
judicial code of ethics by taking part in a unanimous ruling of the
high court that allowed a Brookline reproductive health clinic to
keep longtime anti-abortion protestor Barbara Bell from its doors.
</P>
<P>
   The group based its assertion on Marshall's tenure as a member
of the board of trustees of Crittenton Hastings House, a Brighton
home for unwed mothers that performs more than 1,500 abortions a
year. MCFL president Ray Neary said Marshall's role as a board
member at Crittenton Hastings, which ended in 1995, the year before
she was confirmed as a judge, means that Marshall's impartiality as
a judge is compromised.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Councilor Marilyn Petitto Devaney, a Democrat of
Watertown, Mass., said Marshall was the victim of a ``witch hunt''
perpetrated by abortion rights opponents, declaring that, of the
hundreds of letters and calls she received for and againt
Marshall's nomination, none had mentioned the abortion issue.
</P>
<P>
   But MCFL executive director Maryclare Flynn said she personally
spoke with Devaney and lobbied her to vote against Marshall's
confirmation because of her former affiliation with Crittenton
Hastings. ``I personally called Devaney and mentioned abortion,''
Flynn said. ``And I know others who called her and mentioned
abortion because that was the reason for their calls.''
</P>
<P>
   In Cowin's case, Law's concern about possible anti-Catholic bias
arose from a post-trial ruling in which she increased the standard
payment to attorneys representing a Carney Hospital employee who
successfully sued the Catholic-affiliated institution, claiming he
was wrongfully fired because his superiors believed he was gay.
</P>
<P>
   In her ruling, Cowin cited the difficulty that hospital employee
John Walsh had in finding attorneys willing to take a case in which
they would have to go up against ``the strength of the Catholic
Church.''
</P>
<P>
   Cowin's critics said that because the Church was not
specifically mentioned as a defendant in the case, the wording of
the ruling may have evinced prejudice against Catholics. But at her
confirmation hearing, Cowin, after allowing that she could have
written her ruling ``more artfully,'' said she harbors no
anti-Catholic bias and councilors believed her, resulting in the
unanimous vote for her confirmation as an associate justice.

 &HT;    Players in Atlanta Olympic bid to testify
 &HT;    By Melissa Turner
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Billy Payne certainly never believed Atlanta's
extraordinary Olympic adventure would end up here _ with the city's
heroes called before a Congressional panel bent on ferreting out
possible bribery and skulduggery that brought Atlanta its greatest
glory.
</P>
<P>
   Payne and former Mayor Andrew Young, the two men primarily
responsible for winning the 1996 Games for the city, will testify
this morning before a House Congressional subcommittee
investigating the Olympic site selection process.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Fred Upton (R-Mich.), the committee's chair, has labeled
the system corrupt because gifts and favors were exchanged for
votes.
</P>
<P>
   Payne and Young are not likely to disagree. But they probably
will portray themselves as victims caught up in an anything-goes
environment of currying favor in the hopes of landing the world's
biggest prize.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will describe the environment in which the bid was
conducted,'' said Lee Echols, the bid committee's spokesman, ``and
also discuss the fact that although we jumped over the line from
time to time, the ultimate reward of winning the Games was
Atlanta's most positive experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Upton, chairman of the House Commerce oversight and
investigations subcommittee, may not be persuaded by ``the end
justifies the means'' argument.
</P>
<P>
   A report submitted by former Attorney General Griffin Bell
portrayed the Atlanta bid team members as being tangled in a
pattern of excessive gift-giving and offers of scholarships and job
assistance, athletic training and free health care for IOC members
and their families.
</P>
<P>
   Upton said the report proved ``votes were for sale'' and accused
the IOC of fostering a corrupt bid culture.
</P>
<P>
   That was not the picture Payne painted when the first hint of
vote-buying emerged from Salt Lake City late last year.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, he assured Atlantans that such impropriety didn't
happen on his watch. But as the scandal unfolded over the next 10
months, it became clear it had.
</P>
<P>
   Now Upton wants to publicly air the sordid details as Congress
considers legislation that would limit the IOC's fund-raising in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch declined Upton's request to
appear, saying he was too busy enacting reforms aimed at restoring
the organization's image and credibility.
</P>
<P>
   Anita DeFrantz, a delegate from Los Angeles, is expected to
testify on behalf of the IOC.
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch had similarly snubbed Sen. John McCain's Senate
Commerce Committee hearing into the Salt Lake City Olympic scandal
last April.
</P>
<P>
   Ten IOC members already have been purged, but congressional
leaders are skeptical of the IOC's promise to enact lasting reforms
to make the Lausanne, Switzerland, organization more accountable
and less open to corruption.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech this summer aimed at his critics in Congress,
Samaranch said the IOC, which has bristled under Congress'
spotlight, would enact reforms at its own pace and on its own
terms.
</P>
<P>
   The IOC's own ethics commission would investigate any misconduct
by members related to the Atlanta bid.
</P>
<P>
   ``We say `no' to hasty reforms to please our critics,'' he said.
``No to reforms which defend the interests of some at the expense
of others. No to reforms based on personal and conflicting
interests.''
</P>
<P>
   Other speakers expected to testify: former secretary of state
Henry Kissinger, who serves on an IOC reform commission, and former
Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, whose independent ethics
committee suggested that the IOC undergo major reforms.
</P>
<P>
   DeFrantz said earlier that Congress should take into account
that the IOC has embarked on major reforms, expelling members and
opening its financial books.
</P>
<P>
   Her pleas are falling on deaf ears. McCain (R-Ariz.) plans to
hold hearings next week on the issue of performance-enhancing drugs
in sports.
</P>
<P>
   Barry McCaffrey, the White House drug policy chief, recently
launched a series of scathing attacks on the IOC and its plans to
set up an international anti-drug agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sometimes get the impression that our attentions are not
entirely welcome,'' the Arizona Republican said.

 By LAURA MARTINEZ RUIZ-VELASCO 
 c.1999 Latin Trade 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    LOS ANGELES _ Mexican filmmaker Luis Mandoki was one of the
first Latin American directors to make a Hollywood hit, with
``Gaby: A True Story,'' in 1987. Based on a true account and a
script by Mexican writer Elena Poniatovska, it garnered widespread
recognition, including an Oscar nomination.
 &HT;    Since then, Mandoki has remained in the United States, making
movies that have little or nothing to do with Mexico or Latin
America. He's now working with Hollywood stars such as Meg Ryan,
Andy Garcia and Melanie Griffith, and recently directed Kevin
Costner, Robin Wright Penn, and Paul Newman in the Warner Bros.
film ``Message in a Bottle.''
 &HT;    Mandoki is just one of many Latin American directors who, after
finding fame and fortune in Hollywood, have stayed here to make
movies with multimillion-dollar budgets, produced and directed for
the U.S. moviegoing public.
 &HT;    Examples abound. Mexican director Alfonso Arau has gone from the
success of the surrealist Mexican film ``Como Agua para Chocolate''
(Like Water for Chocolate) to ``magical comedy'' with `` Up
the Pieces,'' starring Woody Allen, Cheech Marin, and Kiefer
Sutherland. Venezuelan director Fina Torres went from the
Venezuelan jungle in ``Oriana'' to Parisian opera in ``Celestial
Clockwork,'' and now has ended up making ``Woman on Top,'' a comedy
about a Brazilian immigrant _ played by Spanish actress Penelope
Cruz _ who arrives in San Francisco and becomes a famous chef on
American television. And after making ``Cuatro Dias en
Septiembre,'' (Four Days in September), Brazilian director Bruno
Barreto is working on a police drama for Miramax, ``One Tough
Cop,'' starring Stephen Baldwin and Chris Penn.
 &HT;    ``About 80 percent of the world's movies come from the U.S. ...
the other countries have to split up the remaining 20 percent,''
says Guillermo Del Toro. The Mexican director has remained in the
horror film genre since arriving in Hollywood, but he has swapped
the Mexican vampires in his flick ``Cronos'' for killer New York
City cockroaches in his movie ``Mimic.'' The $30-million production
made some $70 million at the box office, so of course sequels two
and three are in the works.
 &HT;    All of these Latin American directors have found an unmatched
opportunity in Hollywood to do what they love best: Make movies,
with budgets they could only have dreamed of in their native lands.
 &HT;    Success, of course, has come at a price.
 &HT;    ``Money talks in Hollywood,'' says actress Bel Hernandez,
founder of Latin Heat, an L.A. magazine about Hispanic filmmaking.
``It doesn't matter how great your country is, in Hollywood,
directors take what is available and work on whatever Hollywood
wants.''
 &HT;    There is no lack of opportunity at home. Latin America is
currently undergoing a film-making renaissance.
 &HT;    ``Production is booming in places like Argentina, Brazil and
Mexico ... but there's no place for these films to go,'' says
Michael Donnelly, founder of Shadowfax Films, a distributor of
foreign movies. He points out that, thanks in no small measure to
tax incentives, some 60 films have been made during the past four
years in Brazil. But the majority of local productions hardly
recover their modest budgets because of lack of promotion and
distribution.
 &HT;    The easiest way to make money on them would be to show them in
the United States. But that has always been difficult, and is
getting harder all the time. In the 1960s, about 10 percent of box
office income in the United States came from foreign films. That
number is about 1 percent these days. The growing number of
independent films promises even more competition.
 &HT;    ``There are some very innovative films being made in Spain and
Latin America, but it is not a good time for foreign cinema in the
United States,'' says Cathy Rivera, an expert in Latin America
cinema. ``The boom in American independent films is filling the
space once occupied by foreign alternative cinema.''
 &HT;    ``Latin American movies don't make money in the U.S.,'' says
Andrew Paxman, former head of Latin American news for Variety
magazine.
 &HT;    So Latin American directors have given the market what it wants:
English-language movies with subjects that interest general
audiences. ``The problem is not exclusive to Latin American films.
All foreign movies share it. Distributing a foreign-language film
in the U.S. is always a problem,'' says Del Toro. ``You have to
make movies that can be enjoyed in any part of the world,
independent of its Latin flavor or the language they're made in.''
 &HT;    In an effort to overcome this obstacle, Del Toro, together with
other Mexican directors and a Spanish promoter, created Tequila
Gang, a production house dedicated to making movies in Spanish that
can play worldwide _ and that can make money.
 &HT;    Tequila Gang was behind ``Un Embrujo'' (A Spell), by Mexican
director Carlos Carrera, and it is getting ready to start on the
$6.5 million production of ``El Espinazo del Diablo'' (The Devil's
Spine), a classic ghost tale that will begin filming in Spain at
the end of the year. The film will be produced in partnership with
Pedro Almodovar's production outfit, El Deseo.
 &HT;    Many in the industry are betting that the rise in the
Spanish-speaking population in the U.S. will bring about a bigger
push for Latin American filmmaking. ``The growing awareness about
the Hispanic market in the U.S. is going to help Latin American
films, directors and actors to gain more recognition,'' says
Hernandez of Latin Heat.
 &HT;    The Hispanic community ``prefers to buy, rent and see `gringo'
movies, but if you show them that there's a good product in Spanish
that will entertain them, they'll go see it,'' Del Toro says.
 &HT;    All this has not been lost on U.S. film houses. Kushner-Locke,
an independent distributor and producer, launched Mexican actress
Thalia in her first English-language film, ``Mambo Cafe,'' directed
by Chilean Ruben Gonzalez.
 &HT;    The idea is to penetrate the Hispanic market in the U.S., and,
in the long run, distribute the movies in Latin America.
 &HT;    If successful, this project could put an end to the problems of
Latin American directors, who could dedicate themselves to making
Latin American movies, with Latin American actors, in Hollywood
then export them to Latin America.
 &HT;    Only in Hollywood.

FRANCE RECOGNIZES  ` PACTS' BETWEEN UNMARRIED COUPLES  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By SUZANNE DALEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ The French Parliament passed a new law Wednesday giving
legal status to unmarried couples, including homosexual unions.
</P>
<P>
   The decision came nearly two years after the Socialist
government proposed the law, touching off protests by conservatives
and the Catholic Church.
</P>
<P>
   The law allows couples, whether they are of the same sex or not,
to enter into a union and be entitled to the same rights as married
couples in such areas as income tax, inheritance, housing and
social welfare.
</P>
<P>
   The legal unions, or ``civil solidarity pacts,'' known here by
the acronym PACS, stem from a promise that Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin made to recognize gay unions.
</P>
<P>
   But during the idea's gestation, it grew to include virtually
any two people sharing a home, be it brother and sister or even a
priest and his housekeeper.
</P>
<P>
   The government has bent over backwards to say that PACS are not
marriages but a new form of legal coupling that recognizes the
needs of people today.
</P>
<P>
   In defending the new statute, the justice minister, Elizabeth
Guigou said the law would force ``the retreat of homophobia'' and
offer ``a solution to the 5 million couples who live together
without being married.''
</P>
<P>
   The law passed in the National Assembly by a vote of 315-249.
But conservative lawmakers, who several times delayed the passage
of the bill, immediately said they would ask the Constitutional
Council to decide whether the law is unconstitutional, in which
case it would become void.
</P>
<P>
   The new law makes France the first traditionally Catholic nation
to recognize homosexual unions. But even as the law proceeded
through its last debate, protesters staged a noisy demonstration
outside the National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives and the Catholic Church have denounced the
legislation as an assault on the family, an attack on the moral
fabric of society and a license for debauchery. Debates over the
bill were among the stormiest the country has seen as impassioned
legislators railed at each other.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, more than 200,000 people marched through
Paris to protest the law. One group, the Future of Culture,
bombarded Jospin with 60,000 postcards, saying the plan would
``destroy the remains of civilization still separating us from
barbarism.'' About half the country's 36,000 mayors said at the
outset that they would have nothing to do with officiating at gay
unions.
</P>
<P>
   Yet surveys showed that nearly half the French supported PACS
for homosexuals and even more wanted them for other relationships.
Supporters of the law argued that it was a long overdue
acknowledgment of modern relationships in a country where an
estimated two million heterosexual people live together outside of
marriage and 40 percent of the children are born to unwed parents.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters say the bill will help not only gay couples, but
young couples and older people and relatives, who want to live
together and pool their resources. ``Voulez-vous PACS-er avec
moi?'' became a hot joke here for a while.
</P>
<P>
   Among the provisions in the law, employers will have to take
couples' joint vacation plans into account. Partners will be able
to help foreign partners enter the country and each partner will
become liable for the other's debts.
</P>
<P>
   Couples who want to enter into PACS will sign up before a court
clerk. The contract can be revoked by either party with a simple
declaration, made in writing, which gives the partner three months'
notice. It does not extend any rights to homosexuals wanting to
adopt children or expand any parental rights.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, however, the new law has not entirely satisfied gay
organizations, which are unhappy that the PACS consign homosexual
unions to a lower status than marriage and make no mention of
adoption.
</P>
<P>
   Many people expressed disappointment that the law requires that
they register their union and live together for three years before
they can get the benefits of filing a joint tax return.

`ER' BOOSTER SHOT? ALDA PULLS STAFF DUTY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GOODYKOONTZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - It's not like he's never played a doctor before _ you
may remember a little character named Hawkeye Pierce _ but Alan
Alda isn't sure why the folks at ``ER'' asked him to hang a
stethoscope around his neck again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's this weird thing that I only know about from the
outside,'' Alda says in a conference call promoting his
five-episode stint. ``They're the Number 1 show, and somebody
thought they needed to do better. I don't know how you do better
than that.''
</P>
<P>
   My, how things have changed in the 16 years since Alda hung up
his surgical scrubs on ``MASH.'' As in any big business, it's no
longer enough to be No. 1. Your lead has to increase. Otherwise,
you're losing even if you're winning.
</P>
<P>
   And ``ER'' was losing _ viewers, that is. Not enough to topple
its position atop the heap but, what with George Clooney's
departure and increasingly weak story lines, enough to scare its
producers into adding new characters and hiring some big-name
celebrity guests (Rebecca De Mornay is in the midst of a four-story
arc).
</P>
<P>
   Whatever prompted the call from ``ER,'' Alda is just glad it
came.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so impressed with what I see on the air that they do,'' he
says. ``Some of the things I've seen them do, some of the
sequences, are some of the best things I've ever seen on
television. I think they do extraordinary work.''
</P>
<P>
   He must have missed last season's disastrous Mare Winningham
plot.
</P>
<P>
   Alda plays Dr. Lawrence, an emergency-medicine pioneer whom
Carrie Weaver hires as an attending physician.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had been her mentor when she was in med school,'' Alda says
of the plot. ``Apparently, she had to hire (Lawrence) in a hurry,
and she didn't really check it out with the Mark Green character,
so he's not too happy about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Alda didn't want to say much more about the role, other than
that the producers left the door open ``a crack'' for his return.
He laughs when he says that, and if rumors about what happens with
his character prove true, you'll see why. To say more would spoil
things.
</P>
<P>
   There were similarities to his MASH'' days, Alda says, but
differences, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see roots in ``ER'' that go back to `MASH,' '' he says,
noting that much of emergency medicine is based on wartime
medicine. ``I think they're aware of that. I think there were
things about ``MASH'' they wanted to pick up and carry forward, and
I think they did that.''
</P>
<P>
   On ``MASH,'' Hawkeye and the other doctors occasionally bandied
about medical terms, but nothing like the ``ER'' docs do.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys just rattle it off at each other, paragraph after
paragraph,'' Alda says. ``You sort of have to decode it as you
watch it if you're not a doctor. I think that adds to the interest.
I think they're very brave to do that. . . . Sometimes when I'm
watching it, I have to remind myself that they've rehearsed this
and that they're not really going through an emergency. It looks
very convincing to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of that has to do with another change since the ``MASH''
days: up-close-and-personal gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now the camera looks right down into the wound,'' he says.
``We did all our stuff out of frame. . . . It was only on cable
shows for doctors that you used to see surgery the way it's done on
an entertainment show now.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not just on television that those hacked-off legs and
sucking chest wounds look real, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was standing there over a gurney in one shot . . . and I
looked down at this guy's chest, and they say, `OK, now you're
going to stick the tube in his chest here,' '' Alda says. ``And I
think, well, I guess I have to fake that. How do I stick it in his
chest? I'm looking at his bare chest, and he's got hair growing out
of his chest. Here's his head, there's his chest. I'm three feet
away from him.
</P>
<P>
   ``And they say, `No, stick it right in there. Cut an opening
with the scalpel and stick the tube in. And it turns out it's not
his chest. It's a prosthesis. I thought it was his real chest! And
I'm three feet from him! And I cut a hole in it and stuck it in his
chest. It was revolting.''
</P>
<P>
   Can't wait to see that. Note to self: no late dinners that
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Despite starring in one of the best darkly comic shows in
television history, Alda says he doesn't watch enough TV to
pontificate on the current (sad) state of comedies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do remember the last time TV comedy was supposed to be dead
was right before Bill Cosby started his show and made a billion
dollars,'' he says. ``It seems to periodically die. It's like the
Broadway theater. It's always dying, but it's always thriving at
the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   Thriving may be pushing it. What comedy he does watch doesn't
make him laugh, Alda says.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an awful lot of mannerisms and joke lines that are
there to trigger laughter, rather than give actors a chance to play
a moment,'' he says. ``It's like there's more jokes than there is
humor. And there's a big difference between those two.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's, like, physical cues. There's a style of playing
that's almost like a kabuki of comedy. They make a ritualized
gesture, and that's supposed to be the funny part. I watch it with
sort of amazement. It doesn't make me laugh, but I think, `Look at
that: Those two people are doing this ritualized dance _ how
interesting.' I watch with stupefaction sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Not, presumably, when he watches ``ER.'' Despite his obvious joy
working on the show _ he ranks it alongside his work in ``MASH''
and the play ``Art'' _ Alda, who is writing a screenplay, makes it
clear he has no interest in returning to a network series full
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea of going in every day on a series, I don't picture
that,'' he says. ``If I ever did picture it, I think I couldn't
picture it unless it was with people like this, because they're
tops.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, he's right. Though if this fails to increase ``ER's''
ratings lead, can a Klinger plot be far behind? &QL;

 &HT;    Olympics investigator known for dogged style
 &HT;    By Rebecca Carr

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ On the morning that he took hi presidential
fitness test, a skinny boy named Fred Upton got some bad news: one
of the lowest scores in the class.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Upton arrived at school before any other student
with one thing in mind _ mastering the push-up. By the end of the
year, he had set the school's push-up record and aced the fitness
test.
</P>
<P>
   The story shows the tenacity of a 13-year-old who would later
become a U.S. congressman against improbable odds.
</P>
<P>
   It also sheds light on the way the moderate Michigan Republican
might conduct a wide-ranging inquiry into what he calls the
``culture of corruption'' surrounding Atlanta's bid for the 1996
Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to clean it up,'' said Upton, who at 46 still looks a
little like the Boy Scout he once was. ``The discovery period is
over. We've identified the mistakes. My charge is to restore the
integrity of the Olympic Games. We're going to demand that things
are changed.''
</P>
<P>
   As the chairman of the House Commerce Committee's panel on
investigations, Upton is determined that those demands will be
heard.
</P>
<P>
   If what friends, colleagues and his own family have to say about
him is any indication, Upton won't stop until he has uncovered
every misspent dollar.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't know the words `give up,''' said Bruce Laing, a
longtime friend from Michigan who has chased him down ski slopes
and worked closely on his re-election efforts. ``He's his own
man.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether it's skiing, playing hearts or talking policy, Upton
goes to the limit. When he wanted to propose, for example, he hired
a plane to fly over a Baltimore Orioles game with a banner
emblazoned with: ``Amey, this is the inning to say yes.''
</P>
<P>
   She did, and they now have two children, ages 8 and 11.
</P>
<P>
   On Capitol Hill, Upton constantly urges reporters, aides and
elevator attendants to ``call me Fred'' before they can even utter
the words ``Congressman Upton.''
</P>
<P>
   But Upton's relationship with his own party hasn't always been
so easygoing.
</P>
<P>
   Upton resigned the highly coveted post of deputy whip in 1993
because he did not agree with former House Speaker Newt Gingrich's
confrontational style.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to vote the party line,'' Upton said at the
time. ``I'm going to vote on the merits.''
</P>
<P>
   While he is a staunch fiscal conservative, he has stood against
his party on key social policy issues.
</P>
<P>
   During this summer's gun control debate, for example, Upton
sounded almost Democratic in his support for stricter regulations
on gun sales. He was one of the first Republicans to attack tobacco
companies for trying to sell discounted cigarettes through the mail
to minors. He also supported President Clinton's plans to deter
violent crime with social programs, which resulted in Michigan
Republicans booing him at the state party convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is very fair and thorough,'' said Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.),
who visited Upton's district last year to help him address some
bitter racial divisions between two communities there. ``He's a
great believer in doing what is right and trying to hear all
sides.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He has high moral standards, but he's not a goody-two-shoes;
he knows how the world works,'' said Mike Garey, the owner of a
roofing company in Benton Harbor, Mich., who has known Upton for
most of his life.
</P>
<P>
   The only bias that Upton has is for the Chicago Cubs or the
University of Michigan's football team, Garey said.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from Michigan in 1975 with a degree in
journalism, Upton returned home to St. Joseph to pursue his
lifelong dream of becoming a sports reporter.
</P>
<P>
   But a political speech made by a Republican candidate named
David Stockman changed all that.
</P>
<P>
   Upton was so inspired by Stockman's economic policies that he
signed up to work on his campaign. Soon he was a convert, following
Stockman to Washington to work in his congressional office.
</P>
<P>
   When President Ronald Reagan tapped Stockman to be the director
of the Office of Management and Budget, Upton followed him again.
</P>
<P>
   And when Stockman resigned, Upton went back home, a place where
his grandfather helped found the Whirlpool Corp., to run for
Stockman's former congressional seat.
</P>
<P>
   By then, the job was held by a Republican Christian conservative
named Mark Siljander.
</P>
<P>
   The primary race was tight until a few days before the election
when Siljander told the members of a church they should ``pray and
fast to break the back of Satan.'' The obvious comparison of Upton
to Satan won Upton votes, his father recalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``He does hone in,'' Steve Upton said. ``When he gets
militaristic, he'll hang on until satisfied that he has all the
facts.''

a plane to fly over a Baltimore Orioles game with a banner
emblazoned with: ``Amey, this is the inning to say yes.''
</P>
<P>
   She did, and they now have two children, ages 8 and 11.
</P>
<P>
   On Capitol Hill, Upton constantly urges reporters, aides and
elevator attendants to ``call me Fred'' before they can even utter
the words ``Congressman Upton.''
</P>
<P>
   But Upton's relationship with his own party hasn't always been
so easygoing.
</P>
<P>
   Upton resigned the highly coveted post of deputy whip in 1993
because he did not agree with former House Speaker Newt Gingrich's
confrontational style.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to vote the party line,'' Upton said at the
time. ``I'm going to vote on the merits.''
</P>
<P>
   While he is a staunch fiscal conservative, he has stood against
his party on key social policy issues.
</P>
<P>
   During this summer's gun control debate, for example, Upton
sounded almost Democratic in his support for stricter regulations
on gun sales. He was one of the first Republicans to attack tobacco
companies for trying to sell discounted cigarettes through the mail
to minors. He also supported President Clinton's plans to deter
violent crime with social programs, which resulted in Michigan
Republicans booing him at the state party convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is very fair and thorough,'' said Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.),
who visited Upton's district last year to help him address some
bitter racial divisions between two communities there. ``He's a
great believer in doing what is right and trying to hear all
sides.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He has high moral standards, but he's not a goody-two-shoes;
he knows how the world works,'' said Mike Garey, the owner of a
roofing company in Benton Harbor, Mich., who has known Upton for
most of his life.
</P>
<P>
   The only bias that Upton has is for the Chicago Cubs or the
University of Michigan's football team, Garey said.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from Michigan in 1975 with a degree in
journalism, Upton returned home to St. Joseph to pursue his
lifelong dream of becoming a sports reporter.
</P>
<P>
   But a political speech made by a Republican candidate named
David Stockman changed all that.
</P>
<P>
   Upton was so inspired by Stockman's economic policies that he
signed up to work on his campaign. Soon he was a convert, following
Stockman to Washington to work in his congressional office.
</P>
<P>
   When President Ronald Reagan tapped Stockman to be the director
of the Office of Management and Budget, Upton followed him again.
</P>
<P>
   And when Stockman resigned, Upton went back home, a place where
his grandfather helped found the Whirlpool Corp., to run for
Stockman's former congressional seat.
</P>
<P>
   By then, the job was held by a Republican Christian conservative
named Mark Siljander.
</P>
<P>
   The primary race was tight until a few days before the election
when Siljander told the members of a church they should ``pray and
fast to break the back of Satan.'' The obvious comparison of Upton
to Satan won Upton votes, his father recalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``He does hone in,'' Steve Upton said. ``When he gets
militaristic, he'll hang on until satisfied that he has all the
facts.''

 &HT;    
 &HT;    LOS ANGELES _ Uno de los primeros directores de cine
latinoamericano en lograr el exito en Hollywood fue el mexicano
Luis Mandoki, con su filme Gaby: A True Story (1987). Basada en
hechos de la vida real y un guion de la renombrada escritora
mexicana Elena Poniatovska, la citan recibio todo tipo de
reconocimientos, e incluso una nominacion al Oscar.
 &HT;    Mandoki se quedo en Estados Unidos haciendo peliculas que nada
tienen que ver con Mexico o America Latina. Ahora trabaja con
estrellas de Hollywood como Meg Ryan, Andy Garcia y Melanie
Griffith, y recientemente dirigio a Kevin Costner, Robin Wright
Penn y Paul Newman en Message in a Bottle.
 &HT;    Mandoki es uno de muchos directores latinoamericanos que tras
lograr un exito en Hollywood se quedan a realizar peliculas con
presupuestos millonarios dirigidas al publico norteamericano.
 &HT;    Los ejemplos abundan. El mexicano Alfonso Arau, director de Como
Agua para Chocolate, ha ido del surrealismo mexicano a la comedia
magica con Picking Up the Pieces, una pelicula con Woody Allen,
Cheech Marin y Kiefer Sutherland. La venezolana Fina Torres ha
pasado por la selva venezolana de Oriana y la opera parisina de
Celestial Clockwork, para terminar con Woman on Top, una comedia
sobre una inmigrante brasilena (la actriz espanola Penelope Cruz)
que llega a San Francisco y se vuelve un chef famoso de la
television norteamericana. Despues de Cuatro Dias en Septiembre, el
brasileno Bruno Barreto trabajo en One Tough Cop con Stephen
Baldwin y Chris Penn.
 &HT;    ``El 80 por ciento del cine que se ve es estadounidense ... el
restante 20 por ciento nos lo tenemos que dividir entre todos los
demas paises,'' dice el director mexicano Guillermo Del Toro, quien
mantuvo su genero de terror al llegar a Hollywood, pero cambio el
escenario de los vampiros mexicanos de Cronos por los enormes
insectos asesinos de Nueva York en Mimic, una produccion de US$30
millones que recaudo unos US$70 millones, por lo que ya se planean
una segunda y tercera partes.
 &HT;    Todos estos directores latinoamericanos han encontrado en
Hollywood una oportunidad sin igual para dirigir peliculas con
presupuestos que ni siquiera pueden imaginar en sus paises. Sin
embargo, todo tiene su precio.
 &HT;    ``El dinero habla en Hollywood,'' dice Bel Hernandez, actriz y
fundadora de Latin Heat, una revista de Los Angeles especializada
en cine hispano. ``No importa que tan grandes sean en su pais, aqui
(los directores) toman lo que sean y trabajan en lHollywood quiera
y mande. La cosa es hacerla aqui.''
 &HT;    De hecho, no faltan oportunidades en casa. El cine
latinoamericano no va en picada, por el contrario, paises como
Argentina, Mexico y Brasil ven un renacer de su industria
cinematografica.
 &HT;    ``La produccion esta en auge en lugares como Argentina, Brasil y
Mexico, pero estas cintas no tienen adonde ir,'' dice Michael
Donnelly, fundador de Shadowfax Films, distribuidora de peliculas
clasicas extranjeras, e indica que gracias en no poca medida a los
incentivos fiscales, durante los ultimos cuatro anos en Brasil se
han rodado 60 peliculas.
 &HT;    La manera mas facil de llegar a cuentas seria exhibirlas en
Estados Unidos. Pero mientras que en los anos 60 el 10 por ciento
de los ingresos de taquilla correspondian a peliculas extranjeras,
hoy esa cifra es de apenas el 1 por ciento. Por otro lado esta una
mayor oferta de peliculas de cine independiente, que hace la
competencia aun mas feroz.
 &HT;    ``En Espana y America Latina se filman peliculas muy
innovadoras, pero este no es un buen momento para el cine
extranjero en Estados Unidos. Esto tiene que ver con el auge del
cine independiente estadounidense, que llena el espacio que en otra
epoca ocupo el cine extranjero,'' afirma Cathy Rivera, especialista
en cine latinoamericano que tambien promueve peliculas en espanol.
Para Rivera, dado el aumento de la poblacion hispana en Estados
Unidos, es solo cuestion de tiempo, mercadeo y dinero que el cine
hispano se recupere en Estados Unidos.
 &HT;    Por ahora, como dice Andrew Paxman, ex jefe de noticias
latinoamericanas de la revista Variety, ``el cine latinoamericano
en Estados Unidos no es rentable.''
 &HT;    Asi que los directores latinoamericanos se adaptan a lo que
dicta el mercado norteamericano: filman en ingles temas de interes
para el gran publico. ``El problema no es exclusivo del cine
latinoamericano, sino de cualquier filme que no sea estadounidense.
Distribuir en Estados Unidos una pelicula en otro idioma siempre es
un problema,'' dice Del Toro. ``Hay que producir peliculas que
puedan verse en cualquier parte del mundo, independientemente de su
caracter latino o del idioma en que se cuenten.''
 &HT;    Del Toro, junto con otros directores mexicanos y una promotora
espanola, crearon Tequila Gang, una firma dedicada a producir de
manera rentable cine en espanol para audiencias de todo el mundo.
 &HT;    Tequila Gang estuvo detras de Un Embrujo, del mexicano Carlos
Carrera, y se prepara para una coproduccion de US$6,5 millones, El
Espinazo del Diablo, que comenzara a rodarse en Espana a fines de
este ano con la productora espanola El Deseo, de Pedro Almodovar.
 &HT;    Resulta curioso, pero muchos apuestan a que el crecimiento de la
poblacion de habla hispana en Estados Unidos significara un mayor
impulso al cine latinoamericano. ``La conciencia de que hay un
fuerte mercado hispano en Estados Unidos dara un reconocimiento
mayor a las peliculas, los directores y los actores
latinoamericanos,'' dice Hernandez, de Lat.
 &HT;    ``(La comunidad hispana) opta por comprar, alquilar o ver
peliculas gringas, pero si les demuestras que hay un buen producto
en espanol, que los va a entretener, lo van a ver,'' asegura Del
Toro.
 &HT;    Y esto no ha escapado a la atencion de empresas estadounidenses,
como la productora y distribuidora independiente Kushner-Locke, que
fue la primera en lanzar a la actriz mexicana Thalia como
protagonista de su pelicula Mambo Cafe, un filme en ingles dirigido
por el chileno Ruben Gonzalez. La intencion es tratar de penetrar
el mercado hispano en Estados Unidos y, a la larga, lograr una
distribucion mas amplia en America Latina.
 &HT;    De tener exito, este proyecto podria poner fin a la odisea de
los directores latinoamericanos, que se dedicarian a rodar
peliculas latinoamericanas con actores latinoamericanos en
Hollywood para exportar a America Latina.
 &HT;    Solo en Hollywood.

MASSACHUSETTS IS LAST OF 50 STATES TO PASS BUDGET THIS FISCAL
YEAR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., Wis.)  (bl) 
 By CAREY GOLDBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Massachusetts on Wednesday effectively claimed the
budgetary booby prize for 1999 when legislative leaders announced a
long-awaited agreement that will finally let the state pass its
annual financial plan _ 104 days after the fiscal year began July 1
and dead last among all 50 states.
</P>
<P>
   Senate President Thomas Birmingham and House Speaker Thomas
Finneran _ both Democrats, both powerful figures, and lumped
together by some as ``the Toms'' _ announced their breakthrough
Wednesday with relief after weeks of one-on-one wrangling, often on
a secluded State House balcony high on Beacon Hill.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   When white smoke wafts up from the Vatican, Birmingham told
reporters, people say, ```Habemus papam' _ `We have a pope.' So
perhaps today it would be appropriate to say, `Habemus rationem
pecuniae' _ `We have a financial plan.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Amen!'' responded Finneran with enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Both said the wait had been worthwhile because it had allowed
them to hash out compromises on moves of long-term importance to
the state, from reforming the finances of the subway system to
salting away 70 percent of the hundreds of millions of dollars the
state will receive from the tobacco settlement. The two also
managed after long debates to agree on increasing prescription drug
coverage for low-income elderly patients, proposing that old people
with incomes up to 188 percent of the federal poverty level be
covered by the state for up to $1,250 a year.
</P>
<P>
   But critics remained unmoved by their post-game back-patting and
bonhomie, saying the weeks of tardiness, during which monthly
interim budgets were passed and no new programs could be financed,
had hurt the state, including many poor people and underpaid state
employees who were waiting for promised state money.
</P>
<P>
   Critics also derided the two leaders as chamber chieftains whose
tete-a-tete talks bespoke an autocratic style typical of a
traditional, troubling Massachusetts style of back-room politics.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``The legislature has accomplished next to nothing this year,
and I think it's embarrassing,'' said Brian Cresta, chairman of the
state's Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Along the way, a lot of issues languished and almost died on
the vine,'' he said. ``You expect to see this during bad economic
times,'' he said, but in good times like these, ``It just doesn't
make sense to me.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Actually, say some experts on state budgets, it does make sense
that financial plans become much harder to pass when times are good
_ just as family budgets are harder to agree upon when parents'
incomes are up and a ``no'' to a child's request for a new bike or
sound system is harder to justify.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears to be more difficult in times of plenty for states
to pass a budget compared to relatively lean years, because in
those years, at least legislators understand that there is a limit
to how much they can ask for special projects in districts or for
special programs they favor,'' said Arturo Perez, a senior policy
specialist who follows state budgets at the National Conference of
State Legislatures.
</P>
<P>
   Coming at the end of a record spell of peacetime prosperity,
this year's budgets have been especially slow, Perez said: In
Wisconsin, the next-to-last state, the legislature passed its
budget only last week, and perennially tardy New York, whose fiscal
year starts in April, was four months late as well.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Wisconsin Assembly Speaker Scott Jensen said Wednesday that he
was ``glad to tell the legislative leaders of Massachusetts, ``Tag,
you're it!'' Wisconsin lawmakers mainly got hung up over how much
of the state's $1.1 billion surplus to devote to tax cuts and how
much to spend on new social and education programs, he said. It
ended up cutting about $900 million in taxes and spending about
$200 million, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, disagreement in the overwhelmingly Democratic
legislature was not so much over tax cuts, though the two leaders
did wrestle to an agreement over phasing the income tax down from
5.95 percent to 5.75 percent. Rather, it was an intra-Democrat
tussle focused more on how much windfall money to squirrel away
versus how much to spend now on social programs. Birmingham
appeared to be more for spending, Finneran more for squirreling.
</P>
<P>
   Prosperity also contributes to slow state budgets in the
complacency it engenders among voters, some lawmakers noted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten years ago, if we didn't have a budget this late in the
year, legislators didn't dare go out in public for fear of bodily
harm,'' said Jim Marzilli, a Democratic state representative from
Arlington. ``Now, when I meet my constituents on the street, there
is a mix of befuddlement and contempt for government _ they ask,
`What's wrong with us?' _ but nobody calls me going, `Make the
budget move!' Even while literally hundreds of thousands of people
are harmed by the failure of the legislature to act.''
</P>
<P>
   For weeks, the Boston Globe has been carrying a ``Budget Watch''
noting how many days the budget was late and naming a different set
of victims each day, from parents awaiting daycare subsidies to
school districts crippled in their hiring to elderly patients
skimping on their medications.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, officials in the Republican administration of Gov.
Argeo Paul Cellucci and some columnists in the more conservative
Boston Herald emphasized the positive side of the budget stalemate:
that it saved millions of dollars by holding back planned new
spending. (And the wait is not over yet: Finneran estimates it will
be another two weeks or so before final details can be worked out
and the budget can be passed.)
</P>
<P>
   But critics like Marzilli called the delay outrageous.
</P>
<P>
   ``As our economy creates two huge classes - one of winners and
one of losers -the folks who were most hurt by the budget stalemate
were the ones left behind,'' he said. ``They are not the people who
elect us. And most legislators know that.''

Estados Unidos. Pero mientras que en los anos 60 el 10 por ciento
de los ingresos de taquilla correspondian a p. Por otro lado esta
una mayor oferta de peliculas de cine independiente, que hace la
competencia aun mas feroz.
 &HT;    ``En Espana y America Latina se filman peliculas muy
innovadoras, pero este no es un buen momento para el cine
extranjero en Estados Unidos. Esto tiene que ver con el auge del
cine independiente estadounidense, que llena el espacio que en otra
epoca ocupo el cine extranjero,'' afirma Cdos.
 &HT;    Por ahora, como dice Andrew Paxman, ex jefe de noticias
latinoamericanas de la revista Variety, ``el cine latinoamericano
en Estados Unidos no es rentable.''
 &HT;    Asi que los directores latinoamericanos se adaptan a lo que
dicta el mercado norteamericano: filman en ingles temas de interes
para el gran publico. ``El problema no es exclusivo del ciino de
cualquier filme que no sea estadounidense. Distribuir en Estados
Unidos una pelicula en otro idioma siempre es un problema,'' dice
Del Toro. ``Hay que producir peliculas que puedan verse en
cualquier parte del mundo, independientemente de su caracter latino
o del idioma en que se cuenten.''
 &HT;    Del Toro, junto con otros directores mexicanos y una promotora
espanola, crearon Tequila Gang, una firma dedicada a producir de
manera rentable cine en espanol para audiencias de todo el m estuvo
detras de Un Embrujo, del mexicano Carlos Carrera, y se prepara
para una coproduccion de US$6,5 millones, El Espinazo del Diablo,
que comenzara a rodarse en Espana a fines de este ano con la
productora espanola El Deseo, de Pedro Almodovar. Resulta curioso,
pero muchos apuestan a que el crecimiento de la poblacion de habla
hispana en Estados Unidos significara un mayor impulso al cine
latinoamericano. ``La conciencia de que hay un fuerte mercado
hispano en Estados Unidos dara un reconocimiento mayor a las
peliculas, los directores y los actores latinoamericanos,'' dice
Hernandez, de Latin Heat.
 &HT;    ``(La comunidad hispa) opta por comprar, alquilar o ver
peliculas gringas, pero si les demuestras que hay un buen producto
en espanol, que los va a entretener, lo van a ver,'' asegura Del
Toro.
 &HT;    Y esto no ha escapado a la atencion de empresas estadounidenses,
como la productora y distribuidora independiente Kushner-Locke, que
fue la primera en lanzar a la actriz mexana Thalia como
protagonista de su pelicula Mambo Cafe, un filme en ingles o
por el chileno Ruben Gonzalez. La intencion es tratar de penetrar
el mercado hispano en Estados Unidos y, a la larga, lograr una
distribucion mas amplia en America Latina.
 &HT;    De tener exito, este proyecto podria poner fin a la odisea de
los directores latinoamericanos, que se dedicarian a rodar
peliculas latinoamericanas con actores latinoamericanos en
Hollywood para exportar a America Latina.
 &HT;    Solo en Hollywood.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Fifteen out of 1,871.
</P>
<P>
   Those numbers _ gleaned from the 1999 fall and winter catalogs
from 25 of the most prestigious U.S. publishing houses _ confirm
what any casual trip to a bookstore makes obvious.
</P>
<P>
   Very few Hispanic authors are getting books published _ at least
by mainstream publishers, which is the same thing as saying that
very few Hispanic authors are getting the chance to have their work
read by a wide audience. In the final quarter of this year, 15 of
1,871 books from major publishers, or fewer than 1 percent, were
written by Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somehow, I'm not sure why, it's slumped off a bit,'' says Ash
Green, a senior editor at Knopf. ``The numbers have been better.
We, for instance, publish Sandra Cisneros. I don't think American
publishers shy away from Hispanics. It may just  despite the
growing Hispanic population, the writing tradition there isn't
being developed much.''
</P>
<P>
   Hispanic educators and community leaders agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where kids are concerned, they want to become what they see,''
says Anita Quinones, who coordinates the Fort Worth school
district's school-to-work program and who has been an educator for
more than 20 years. ``Our kids aren't exposed to careers in
writing. Historically, they haven't had lots of books in their
homes, which perhaps is connected with economics. For economically
disadvantaged families, owning books may not be a priority compared
to buying other necessities.''
</P>
<P>
   Hispanic youngsters she talks to, Quinones notes, are often
interested in the arts.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that means acting, drawing and painting, but not
writing,'' she says. ``They get those ideas from watching TV and
going to movies. So they think about acting in that movie, but not
writing the book that movie is based on.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Fernandez, who serves on multiple local and state
community boards, including the state Board of Higher Education,
faults Hispanic families and public-school curriculums.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, our kids aren't growing up in family environments where
literary individuals are highly regarded,'' he says. ``That's my
opinion, unfortunately. But it's also true that, in school, I was
not exposed to Hispanic authors until I took some courses in
college. Public schools do not expose us to Hispanic authors as we
are growing up.''
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly, Quinones says, ``very few Hispanic kids I have
worked with _ very, very few _ have even mentioned the possibility
of becoming writers. I think some of them are probably writing on
their own at home without anybody saying to them, `Hey, that's a
good thing to be doing.' I think they have to get their support
outside the home.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet area support groups for developing writers report minuscule
Hispanic membership.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have any Hispanics out of about 60 members,'' says
Lucile Davis, who founded Fort Worth's Freelance Writers Network
five years ago. ``I've had inquiries about the group from two
Hispanics. I also teach a continuing-education writing class at
TCU, and in three semesters, only one Hispanic has enrolled. Now,
the African-American community seems to be encouraging writers.
There are several African-American writers' groups around now. But
there isn't one especially for Hispanic writers.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman says the 85-member D/FW Writers Workshop has no
Hispanic members.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the most, we had maybe six or seven,'' says longtime member
Jack Ballas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think many publishers are getting manuscripts from
Hispanics,'' says Kenneth Kirkland, an independent publishing
industry analyst based in New York. ``You can't print their books
if they're not being offered to you.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if more Hispanic writers were submitting manuscripts to
publishers, odds are not in favor of them selling their work.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that's the same as it is for almost any writers in 1999,''
says Judy Alter, director of Fort Worth's Texas Christian
University Press and the author of many fiction and nonfiction
titles. ``Right now, publishers are cutting back their publishing
lists, so there are fewer chances for Hispanic writers, black
writers, any kind of writer.''
</P>
<P>
   Kirkland says Hispanic writer-wannabes might also be hampered
``by not knowing how the publishing industry works. For instance,
they may not know you need an agent to sell a book to a major house
like Knopf or Putnam. Or, if they do, they may not know anyone who
can tell them how to find an agent.''
</P>
<P>
   But as the U.S. Hispanic population grows, many literary agents
are beginning to believe that Hispanic authors could eventually tap
into a new, gigantic market.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying hard to develop our Hispanic client list,'' says
Jan Miller, of Dupree/Miller Literary Agency in Dallas. ``I think
it's going to explode in very much the same way the
African-American market did 10 years ago.'' (About 8 percent of
this fall's 1,871 books are by black writers.)
</P>
<P>
   Michael Rosenberg, owner of the Rosenberg Group in Fort Worth,
says he has recently attended ``four Southwest writers' conferences
looking for Hispanic writers. We think there is going to be an
opportunity for them in the publishing industry. They are difficult
to find; we're looking in the academic community and now we're
talking to one, a professor of sociology. We're waiting for him to
send us his book proposal.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, publishers haven't beaten the bushes for
Hispanic authors, Miller says, ``because sales of books by Hispanic
writers haven't warranted it.''
</P>
<P>
   That opinion is seconded by Alter.
</P>
<P>
   ``In any financially based business, the product offered to the
public is determined by what's going to sell best,'' Alter says.
``I think we've published one book by a Hispanic author, published
it both in English and Spanish, and we had a hard time marketing
it. The feeling was that there weren't enough Hispanic readers to
support Hispanic authors.''
</P>
<P>
   That is going to change, Miller predicts.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to find the right writing talent, like you have to
find the right talent in anything,'' she says. ``So we're out
looking hard, even looking on the Internet, and it's going to be
fun. What we've seen with the African-American market is crossover.
It's not a case anymore that only black readers read black writers.
Now for the next 10 years, I think we'll see that for Hispanics and
Hispanic writers, too.''

JURY CLEARS COUNTRY SINGER OF MURDER CHARGES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RALPH WININGHAM  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UVALDE, Texas _ Country singer Johnny Rodriguez lowered his head
in relief and his supporters cheered Wednesday as a Uvalde County
jury found him innocent of murder.
</P>
<P>
   The six-man, six-woman jury returned its verdict after two hours
of deliberations.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez had been charged with murder in the Aug. 29, 1998,
shooting death of Israel ``Bosco'' Borrego, 26, at the Rodriguez
family home in Sabinal. The singer, who did not testify during the
trial, said he shot Borrego in self-defense after Borrego broke
into the house.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Borrego family, including Borrego's widow, Anita,
began softly crying when the verdict was read.
</P>
<P>
   The jurors were immediately ushered from the courthouse under
heavy security after the decision was announced, and Rodriguez was
quickly hustled to the judge's chamber. More than a dozen law
enforcement officers were in the courtroom for security when the
verdict was read.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing that went through my mind was that I could be
a father to my baby,'' Rodriguez said later in a courtroom news
conference. He said his daughter, Aubrey Rae, is 18 months old.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez said he was relieved to be acquitted, adding that he
is embarrassed and sorry about the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to thank my wife, my family and the jury, and everybody
who has been so nice,'' he said. ``I know a lot of people have been
praying for me, and I've been doing some extra praying myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Relatives and friends of both families have maintained a
constant vigil inside and outside the courthouse throughout the
six-day trial in Uvalde, 50 miles west of San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   There had been no incidents during the trial, but witnesses
testified there had been threats by the Borregos against anyone who
supported Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   One member of the Borrego family, Baltazar Borrego, is in the
Uvalde County Jail on a charge of making a threat that reportedly
included a promise ``to kill Johnny, if he walks.''
</P>
<P>
   District Attorney Tony Hackebeil said ``the jury has spoken''
and that he was satisfied with the way he presented the case.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Brown, the lawyer who represented Rodriguez, said he
believed the jury was sending a message with its verdict.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've heard clearly that citizens should have the right to
defend themselves,'' Brown said. ``We could have tried this case
anywhere, and we would have the same result.''

 &HT;    S.C. city declares Klan terrorists
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLESTON, S.C. _ A Charleston, S.C., councilman who sponsored
a city resolution to declare the Ku Klux Klan a terrorist
organization said Wednesday he will now push for state legislation
condemning hate groups.
</P>
<P>
   First-term Councilman Wendell Gilliard said if he can find a
sponsor for a resolution denouncing hate groups, he would expect
``rigorous debate'' among South Carolina legislators.
</P>
<P>
   He likened it to the debate over the Confederate battle flag
flying atop the state capitol in Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are not different topics,'' said Gilliard, 45. ``The Ku
Klux Klan, since its inception in the 1800s, has taken the
Confederate flag and used it as a symbol for their organization.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of the flag protest, the South Carolina NAACP will hold
its annual meeting next week in North Carolina, beginning Thursday
in Charlotte.
</P>
<P>
   Charleston's city council Tuesday approved by voice vote the
resolution stating that ``the Ku Klux Klan is a terrorist
organization.'' It said Charleston ``welcomes diverse opinion,''
but added that the city ``does not tolerate speech, actions, or
activities that incite violence in our community.'' ``What council
did was exercise its freedom of speech,'' city attorney Bill Regan
said, ``but it was not an enactment of any law.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Klan wants to march, it may apply for a permit.
</P>
<P>
   Echoing a concern raised by some council members, Regan said
publicity from the resolution ``might prompt the Klan to march
again in Charleston, something that has not happened for 10
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Potok, of the Southern Poverty Law Center in Montgomery,
Ala., said he believes Charleston may be the first municipality to
declare the Klan a terrorist group. But he questioned whether the
resolution would have much impact aside from symbolic rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the aim is in some way to ban the Klan or prevent them from
rallying or publishing, I think it is quite pointless,'' Potok
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Gilliard, a Charleston native who recalls rural cross
burnings as a teen-ager, said he intended the resolution as a
warning that the Klan and other hate groups are still active in
America.

EAGLES' BACKUP QUARTERBACK IS READY, JUST IN CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Brian St. Pierre, quite naturally, was shocked. The
Boston College redshirt freshman quarterback had no idea starter
Tim Hasselbeck had been injured in last Saturday's 24-14 loss at
Temple until Hasselbeck gingerly boarded the team bus, his right
(throwing) arm in a sling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked him what had happened,'' St. Pierre said Wednesday,
``and he said, `They think I might have separated my shoulder.' It
was a total shock to me. Since then, I haven't really talked with
Tim much about it. I know I don't like it when I'm injured and
people come up to me and ask about it, but I know Tim's done
everything this week to get himself ready like he should.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the starter and if he can play, he should play.''
</P>
<P>
   But, St. Pierre admitted, when he first saw Hasselbeck's wing in
a sling, another thought crossed his mind. ``This could be a week
where I need to be even more prepared, if that's possible,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   While St. Pierre got a majority of the repetitions in Tuesday's
practice, Hasselbeck proclaimed Wednesday he was ready to return to
work and expressed every confidence that he would be ready to play
in BC's huge Big East home game Saturday against Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   ``I threw some (Tuesday), but not a whole lot,'' Hasselbeck
said. ``But I felt a whole better and it wasn't bothering me, so
I'm ready to get back.''
</P>
<P>
   Hasselbeck did not report the mild shoulder separation until
after he completed 14 of 22 passes for 146 yards and a 3-yard
touchdown pass to fullback Ryan Burch. He threw one interception
and was sacked three times. But Hasselbeck said that at no time
during the Temple game did he feel his injury hindered his
performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I watched the tape and I know what play it happened on,
and I had a touchdown pass after that,'' Hasselbeck said. ``I hurt
it on an option play in the first quarter. The first one we ran was
when we were down on the goal line and next one we ran was when we
hurt it.''
</P>
<P>
   When told he appeared to be the latest casualty among Big East
quarterbacks, given the injuries to West Virginia's Marc Bulger
(broken index finger) and Rutgers's Mike McMahon (separated
shoulder), Hasselbeck shrugged and said, ``It's the fifth game and
really it's the first bump I've had. Playing this game, you've got
to expect it. You're not going to finish the season completely
healthy, so I'm not discouraged about this at all.''
</P>
<P>
   That certainly wasn't the case with Hasselbeck's older brother,
Matt, whose first year as a starter in 1996 was truncated by a
shoulder injury against Temple, forcing him to sit out the finale
at Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``He separated his left shoulder against Temple, which is
obviously different from when you're a righthanded quarterback,''
Tim said. ``But like I said I was able to throw (Tuesday) and I
feel better today. They wanted to see how it would feel today after
throwing (Tuesday) and it doesn't feel worse, so that was
encouraging. I'm approaching this like a normal week with the way I
feel right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Which meant, of course, that Hasselbeck went back to working
with the first-team offense and St. Pierre went back to work as
Hasselbeck's backup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to lie you. I don't like backing up. I don't
like not being on the field,'' said St. Pierre, who had hoped to
earn the starting job in preseason camp. ``I understand the
situation and I understand my role right now, as far as they
wanting to get me a series or two in the second quarter. I think
that's good and it benefits me. I think it'll benefit the team
because if something were to happen to Tim, then I'd have some
experience. At the same time, it's hard coming out of the game or
coming in cold off the bench, but I'll just take it week to week.''
</P>
<P>
   St. Pierre has made second-quarter appearances in all five games
so far this season, completing 14 of 20 passes for 175 yards. He
has been intercepted twice, once in the Navy game, where he tried
to force a ball into quadruple coverage, and again at Temple, where
he made the right decision and the right throw, but wound up
getting intercepted in the end zone when redshirt freshman Jamal
Burke was outleaped by cornerback Fulton Fryar.
</P>
<P>
   ``In that situation, you couldn't have drawn up a better play,''
St. Pierre said. ``We had man-to-man, bump and run. It was an
all-go play with four verticals and that's where my read took me. I
put the ball there and Jamal made a great effort for it and the
(Fryar) kid did, too.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the Navy pick? ``That was just a bad play on my part,''
he said. ``I was trying to force it and make something happen. I
think it was just a product of me pressing a little bit because I
want to play so badly. It was just inexperience on my part, but in
the past few weeks I think I've come so far since the Navy game.''
</P>
<P>
   While he is unsure of Hasselbeck's status, St. Pierre knows
he'll have to remain on ready-alert status against Pitt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wednesday was great getting those reps, because I feel like I
know more about the game plan this week than I have in any other
week,'' St. Pierre said. ``I don't know what to expect today and I
don't know what to expect Saturday, so I'll just go about soaking
up everything I can. You try to take every rep you can and just be
ready to play, because you're one play away just like you are on
every Saturday.''

   BC athletic director Gene DeFilippo indicated the ticket office
had been besieged with calls from angry fans who complained about
the switch of Saturday's starting time from noon to 5 p.m. to
accommodate the ESPN2 telecast. The Eagles, as a result, will go
head-to-head with Game 3 of the ALCS between the Red Sox and
Yankees. ``If we had our druthers, we'd prefer to have it at
noon,'' DeFilippo said. ``But we have no control over it. Our hands
are tied because of TV, and so are the Red Sox.'' . . . Senior free
safety Pedro Cirino, a Yankees fan at heart, said he doesn't mind
if Game 3 is the biggest game in town Saturday. ``That's fine,'' he
said. ``I don't mind the Yankees coming up here and spanking some
butt.'' Cirino, however, failed to mention he was a Yankees fan
when, during preseason camp, he happened upon Red Sox ace Pedro
Martinez, who was sitting on the steps outside the North entrance
of Conte Forum waiting on a friend. ``I introduced myself and we
talked in Spanish a little bit,'' Cirino said.

UTILITIES MERGER: BOLD MOVE FROM A METHODICAL COMPANY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Northeast points)  (lh) 
 By AGIS SALPUKAS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Five years ago, when deregulation of the utility
industry was just beginning in the Northeast, including New York
state, Eugene R. McGrath, the chairman and chief executive of
Consolidated Edison Inc. proudly showed off a large plan that
covered a wall in a room at its downtown Manhattan headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   It outlined in detail the steps the utility would take to
prepare for competition.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, McGrath said he wanted a gradual approach in which
the utility was able to adapt to change but still keep its system
reliable; continue paying its steadily increasing dividend to many
of its mostly older stockholders, and strengthen its balance sheet
to be able take advantage when opportunity knocked.
</P>
<P>
   It was not an approach that excited Wall Street. His methodical
approach seemed out of step with the fast pace taken by other
utilities, many of which hunted for merger partners and had big
ambitions to become national sellers of electricity.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, McGrath put Con Edison on the national stage with a
deal that holds the promise of cheaper power for its customers. At
a news conference in Berlin, Conn., McGrath announced the
acquisition of New England Utilities in deal worth $25 a share in
cash or stock, or $3.29 billion. The transaction also includes the
assumption of $4.2 billion in debt.
</P>
<P>
   Under this bold move, Con Edison will become the dominant force
in the Northeast in the rapidly changing industry and will become
one of the largest utilities in the country with a customer base of
4.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   But McGrath took care in an interview to point out that he was
staying on his straight and narrow path. ``Our core strategy is to
be a wires and pipes company,'' he said, meaning the company will
primarily deliver electricity and other services and no longer be a
large generator of electricity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not deviating from our business.'' he added. ``It has be
very close to what we know.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, he has kept the door open to becoming a dominant
player in the Northeast in the selling of electricity, natural gas
and eventually other services like security systems and
telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
   The two utilities have both set up marketing groups backed by
subsidiaries that have kept a core of power plants that are low
cost and will be a source of cheap electricity. Thus Con Edison is
in a strong position as states in the Northeast allow customers to
choose their electricity provider.
</P>
<P>
   A subsidiary called ConEdison Solutions has been marketing power
and other services, mostly in the New York metropolitan area, and a
unit of Northeast Utilities called Select Energy Inc. has been
doing the same in an 11-state area.
</P>
<P>
   McGrath said that the two units would most likely be combined to
save money, avoid duplication and bring together expertise.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the two marketing groups are concentrating on signing
up large customers like retail chains, businesses and institutions
that buy large amounts of electricity and natural gas, which are
more profitable than residential customers.
</P>
<P>
   The sales force also offers other services like upgrading
heating systems, balancing out the use of power to take advantage
of lower off-peak rates and programs to manage energy use.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, little attention has been paid to individual retail
customers because the cost of persuading them to switch and then
billing them is high.
</P>
<P>
   In the near future, smaller customers will see few marketers
offering them alternatives in states like New York, Connecticut and
Massachusetts, which have begun to deregulate.
</P>
<P>
   As markets are opened wider, however, smaller customers will be
able to buy cheaper power.
</P>
<P>
   Some people are seeing benefits already. Con Edison customers,
for example, will see their rates decrease by 10 percent by 2001
under New York's order to deregulate. And states served by
Northeast Utilities, like Connecticut and Massachusetts, plan to
require rate cuts under deregulation.
</P>
<P>
   Michael G. Morris, the chairman, president and chief executive
of Northeast Utilities, said in an interview Wednesday, that his
group had gained experience in selling to small customers and could
make money.
</P>
<P>
   John Boyd, the president of ConEdison Solutions, said in an
interview Wednesday that it was difficult to bring significant
savings on electricity because utilities had already been providing
power inexpensively. He said that perhaps 5 percent to 10 percent
could be cut form the power portion of the bill, which is about 25
percent of customers' total bills. The rest is for delivery of
electricity, which will not be opened to competition.
</P>
<P>
   In the future, he said, technological innovations will allow
even smaller customers to get bigger savings.
</P>
<P>
   Even in bringing together the marketing units of the two
companies, McGrath remained cautious. ``We're going to be very
careful about the way we do things'' he said. ``We want to start
out on the right foot.''

RHODE ISLAND SUES PAINT MAKERS OVER LEAD-POISONING HEALTH COSTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: R.I., Calif., Del., Ohio, Texas, N.J., S.C., Mid., Miss.)  (bl) 
 By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Rhode Island attorney general sued eight paint manufacturers
and a lead industry trade group in state court Tuesday in an effort
to make them pay for treating children poisoned by lead paint and
removing lead paint from buildings.
</P>
<P>
   At least a dozen other states, counties and cities are
considering filing similar suits, as governments did earlier
against the tobacco and gun industries, and others are considering
suits, lawyers involved in the cases said.
</P>
<P>
   And as in the suits against cigarette makers, which led to
settlements with the states totaling $240 billion, lawyers for
Rhode Island are accusing paint manufacturers of knowing lead paint
was dangerous, especially to children, and of covering up the risk.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government banned lead paint in 1978 because of
health concerns, but studies this decade have found that two-thirds
of the nation's housing still contains lead paint, and that 890,000
children between 1 and 5 years old have elevated lead levels in
their blood. Ingesting paint chips or dust containing lead can
cause severe mental, developmental and behavioral problems,
including lowered intelligence, in children.
</P>
<P>
   High lead levels are more common in the older Northeast, where
many homes and buildings were constructed more than a generation
ago, when lead was a standard ingredient in paint. According to
Rhode Island officials, 20 percent of kindergarten students there
have elevated blood-lead levels.
</P>
<P>
   The Rhode Island suit accuses the eight companies, or companies
that they now own, of promoting the use of lead paint while
covering up the dangers it posed to children. The suit, filed by
Attorney General Sheldon Whitehouse, also names as a defendant the
Lead Industries Association, an industry trade group.
</P>
<P>
   The defendants are Atlantic Richfield Co. of Los Angeles; DuPont
Co. of Wilmington, Del.; Sherwin-Williams Co. of Cleveland; and NL
Industries Inc. of Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Also named were Glidden Co., a unit of Imperial Chemical
Industries PLC in England; O'Brien Corp., which was bought by ICI;
and SCM Chemicals Inc. and American Cyanamid Co., whose paint
liabilities were assumed by Cytec Industries Inc. of West Paterson,
N.J.
</P>
<P>
   A number of lawsuits against lead manufacturers by individual
plaintiffs have failed in the past. But the Rhode Island lawsuit
seeks a different remedy, following the path of state lawsuits
against the tobacco industry, which ended in settlements totaling
more than $240 billion.
</P>
<P>
   As in those cases, which sought to recoup the costs of treating
smoking-related illnesses, Rhode Island is seeking reimbursement of
money spent on the health costs of lead paint, not money to
compensate individual victims.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers pressing the new cases also plan to harness the same
financial resources used to pay for the tobacco litigation, as at
least three lawyers who played major roles and won huge fee awards
in suits against tobacco will be involved in lead-paint cases. The
Rhode Island attorney general said the plaintiffs' lawyers would
receive about 17 percent of any verdict or settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Lead industry officials called the lawsuit a ``groundless and
wasteful action'' and said that past lawsuits alleging industrywide
conspiracies have failed. ``This is litigation that is trying to
make a scapegoat of responsible companies,'' said Timothy Hardy, a
lawyer representing NL Industries, one of the defendants in the
Rhode Island suit. ``The story the plaintiff lawyers are trying to
tell is wrong.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Jeff Miller, executive director of the Lead Industries
Association, said he had not seen the lawsuit and could not comment
on its specifics. But he said blood-lead levels have been falling
for years, in part because the industry quit selling lead paint in
the early 1960s. ``Most kids are way below any medical level of
concern,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Motley, a key lawyer in the state tobacco lawsuits, whose
firm filed the Rhode Island lead-paint suit, said he believed that
documents he has show that the industry covered up the dangers of
lead paint, much as tobacco executives hid the dangers of smoking.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were as omnipresent and evil as the tobacco industry ever
hoped to be,'' Motley said. ``This is not a teenage problem. This
is a toddler problem. The tobacco industry targeted teenagers, but
at least teenagers could read. You're talking about poisoning
children with an odorless, colorless but tasty thing. It's
insidious.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for New York City Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said
the city is looking at possibly suing lead paint manufacturers but
that no decision has been made. A spokesman for New York State
Attorney General Eliot Spitzer said he was not aware of any
imminent plans to file a suit against the industry.
</P>
<P>
   The Rhode Island lawyers will seek to contrast advertisements
and statements by manufacturers that lead is not harmful with
internal and other documents that they contend demonstrate the
industry knew of serious health risks but lied about them and
sought to delay increased labeling and disclosure.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Subpoenas to the defendants will begin going out this week,
lawyers said. But they already have obtained some documents that
they say support their accusations, with industry officials
dismissing concerns about poisoning as a problem faced largely by
``slum children,'' while also showing that they knew more than 50
years ago that lead was toxic and lead paint dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   One document, from the Lead Industries Association's 1959 annual
report, comments that lead poisoning, or the threat of it, ``means
thousands of items of unfavorable publicity every year. This is
particularly true since most cases of lead poisoning today are in
children, and anything sad that happens to a child is meat for
newspaper editors and is gobbled up by the public. It makes no
difference that it is essentially a problem of slums, a public
welfare problem. Just the same, the publicity hits us where it
hurts.''
</P>
<P>
   And, according to the lawsuit, the association's director of
health and safety informed members in 1955 that ``childhood lead
poisoning is common enough to constitute perhaps my major
`headache,' this being in part due to the very poor prognosis in
many such cases, and also to the fact that the only real remedy
lies in educating a relatively ineducable category of parents. It
is mainly a slum problem with us,'' the lawsuits quotes document as
stating, adding that ``we have no monopoly on either substandard
housing or substandard mentalities in the U.S.A.''
</P>
<P>
   Hardy, the lawyer for NL Industries, said these documents have
been introduced into courts before, and yet no judge or jury has
ruled against the manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   Don Ryan, executive director of the Alliance to End Childhood
Lead Poisoning, a public interest group in Washington, said lead
poisoning has long been a more severe problem in lower-income
areas. But he said it also afflicts affluent areas, especially when
renovations cause the release of lead-paint dust.
</P>
<P>
   Some problems happen because of ``the inadvertent creation of
hazards at the other end of the economic spectrum, yuppies fixing
up the grand old Victorian,'' Ryan said. He estimates it would cost
$500 billion to remove all the paint in the nation's dwellings.
</P>
<P>
   The lead-paint lawsuits will be a reunion of sorts for some of
the most important lawyers involved in the state tobacco
settlements.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from Motley, whose Charleston, S.C., firm, Ness, Motley,
Loadholdt Richardson &AMP; Poole, represented 28 states in the tobacco
litigation, Baltimore Orioles owner Peter Angelos, another
prominent anti-tobacco plaintiff lawyer, filed two cases against
lead paint manufacturers in September in Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   And Richard Scruggs, a Pascagoula, Miss., lawyer who also was
instrumental in the tobacco litigation, is expected to play a part
in at least a few lead paint lawsuits in the Southeast. Scruggs
said Wednesday he may not become involved at the same national
scope as he was with tobacco, due to the press of other cases,
including recent litigation against HMOs. But he said ``in some
selected cases, I'm sure we'll be with them.''

HISPANIC LITERARY LUMINARIES _ AND NEWCOMERS TO WATCH
</HEADLINE>
 
Accompanies HISPANICS-MISSING (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF GUINN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Three Hispanic writers have earned special renown, certainly
achieving the so-called crossover audience that guarantees
six-figure book advances and regular visits to bestseller lists. In
approximate order of literary importance, they are:
</P>
<P>
   OSCAR HIJUELOS, a Cuban-American who became the first Hispanic
writer to win the Pulitzer Prize for fiction. ``The Mambo Kings
Play Songs of Love'' remains his best-known novel, but any Hijuelos
novel is exceptional. ``The Fourteen Sisters of Emilio Montez
O'Brien'' is equally full-spirited, whereas ``Empress of the
Splendid Season'' is a darker tale of dreams thwarted and a
middle-aged woman's determination not to give in to life's
disappointments.
</P>
<P>
   ISABEL ALLENDE is Chilean, and, unlike Hijuelos, is a Hispanic
whose major works were first published in Spanish and translated
into English. ``The House of the Spirits'' is her most popular
work, thanks partly to its movie version. But there is also
``Cuentos de Eva Luna'' (''Tales of Eva Luna,'' ``El Plan
Infinito'' (''The Infinite Plan'') ``Hija de la Fortuna''
(''Daughter of Fortune'') and, most recently, the sensual
``Aphrodite: A Memoir of the Senses.''
</P>
<P>
   Texan SANDRA CISNEROS is the most eclectic of the trio: She
seems equally at home writing for children (''The House on Mango
Street);'' and adults (''Woman Hollering Creek and Other Stories;''
``My Wicked, Wicked Ways),'' a collection of poems. Cisneros'
emergence a half-dozen years ago was considered a sign that more
talented Hispanic writers would come to national literary
attention, but that didn't prove to be the case.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even in today's sparse Hispanic market, there are a
number of gifted authors whose books are readily available in local
stores. These writers include:
</P>
<P>
   YXTA MAYA MURRAY, whose gritty barrio tales (''What It Takes to
Get to Vegas'' and ``Locas)'' have either captivated readers or
elicited accusations of stereotype-ng. Maya Murray has the
kind of writing style that invites strong emotional reaction, both
pro and con. She's someone to watch.
</P>
<P>
   ERIC GARCIA, a screenwriter-turned-author whose first novel,
``Anonymous Rex,'' is a quirky farce starring a race of dinosaurs
who masquerade as humans, hiding their reptilian identity from
``Homo sapiens.'' ``Anonymous Rex'' is solid proof that Garcia is
one of those rare authors who can combine good writing chops with
colorful, if somewhat warped, characters and story lines (think
Christopher Moore and ``The Lust Lizard of Melancholy Cove'').
</P>
<P>
   ANA CASTILLO, author of ``Peel My Love Like an Onion,'' a novel
destined to be short-listed for many major literary awards. Carmen
Santoas, its protagonist, is a flamenco dancer hampered by
childhood polio. Other notable Castillo titles include ``So Far
From God,'' ``Loverboys'' and ``Massacre of the Dreamers.''
</P>
<P>
   ANDRES Martinez, a journalist of note (''The Wall Street
Journal,'' among other papers), offers as his first book
``24//7:Living It Up and Doubling Down in the New Las Vegas.''
Because his book isn't limited to Hispanic experience, Martinez may
be the first of the New Wave to gain the attention of mainstream
readers.
</P>
<P>
   FELIPE FERNANDEZ-ARMESTO is anything but a struggling author; he
is on the faculty of Britain's Oxford University. Some of his
previous books (''Millennium,'' ``Reformations'') have received
considerable attention in academic circles. But ``Truth: A History
and a Guide for the Perplexed'' is being published by mainstream
St. Martin's Press, and its chatty, informal tone
(Fernandez-Armesto's first example of semitruth is the Santa Claus
legend) makes it a definite contender for bestsellerdom.

<P>
   Some addiction counselors classify the children of alcoholics
into behavioral types: the hero child, who tries to save the family
by doing everything right; the scapegoat, who constantly fails and
gets into trouble; and the lost child, who goes AWOL from the
family dynamic and develops a private solution, sometimes with
disastrous results.
</P>
<P>
   With the ironically titled ``Joe the King,'' which opened on
Friday, Frank Whaley has made an intensely affecting yet
unsentimental movie about a lost child. That the film contains a
large dollop of autobiography _ it is dedicated to his parents _
only makes this 36-year-old actor's achievement more striking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe the King'' is Whaley's first outing as a writer and
director, and if this is what's considered a small film, it's an
exceptionally rich one. The movie won the screenwriting award at
this year's Sundance Festival, and it opens with a beautifully
composed pan of schoolchildren on the lawn at recess that feels
like a tour of childhood itself.
</P>
<P>
   We see children playing, reading, chatting, roughhousing and, in
a few lonely instances, wistfully looking on. Finally, beyond a
dense barrier of leafy shrubs, the camera finds Joe. He's slumped
against the side of the building, his hands in his pockets and his
back to the world.
</P>
<P>
   His hair is so short you wonder if his head has been shaved.
When the bell goes off, he jerks around to reveal a gaunt face and
hard, fearful eyes; a half-smoked cigarette droops from his mouth.
He can't be more than 9 or 10.
</P>
<P>
   The first 20 minutes of ``Joe the King'' are background,
sketching in the misery of Joe's early childhood before moving on.
His father (played without a scrap of vanity by a bloated,
bleary-looking Val Kilmer) is a surly drunk who does some of his
drinking at Joe's school, where he's the janitor.
</P>
<P>
   This makes him all but ubiquitous in his son's life. It also
makes Joe the target of cruelty by other children, and by a
sadistic teacher, who gives him a bare-bottom spanking in front of
the class after he throws an eraser at a child who has razzed him.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it happened today,'' Whaley says, ``she'd be arrested. She
pulled down my pants, and it was mortifying. It's like a dream _
you know how you remember moments of it? I remember the kids in the
class looked like they were in shock. They were as traumatized as I
was.''
</P>
<P>
   This scene points up the perils of autobiographical art. The
teacher, played with monstrous relish by Camryn Manheim _ it's one
of the movie's more piquant pleasures that we get to see some
high-profile actors in down-and-dirty roles _ is a villain of
near-Dickensian dimensions. Whaley says this is one incident that
was drawn from life, but reality has a way of pushing realism into
melodrama. What saves the scene is the way it's shot, with just the
faintest touch of Grand Guignol wit.
</P>
<P>
   Whaley likes to hear that his film is unsentimental. ``When
you're dealing with something of a personal nature, it's easy to
become precious with it,'' he says. ``Something you might sit at
home and cry about may not be important to the rest of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   His clipped speech and flattened vowels make Whaley, who grew up
in inner-city Syracuse, sound a little like a character out of a
1940s movie; with his pale, serious face, small features and thick
shock of brown hair, he looks like one, too. He could be a Dead End
Kid grown up or John Garfield's younger brother.
</P>
<P>
   He has had a busy 12-year film career, mostly with leading roles
in small films (``Swimming with Sharks,'' ``Homage'') and
supporting roles in big ones (``The Doors,'' ``Hoffa,'' ``Field of
Dreams.'')
</P>
<P>
   We meet at a French cafe in Chelsea, where Whaley lives. The
cafe, which specializes in crepes and coffee, isn't chic, exactly,
but it's very '90s. The young women who work there tend to be slim
and leggy, the men incline to fashionable, convict-cropped hair or
retro-hippie locks.
</P>
<P>
   In this setting, maybe what makes Whaley stand out most is his
complete lack of self-absorption. He seems far more interested in
what's going on around him than in himself, and he enjoys a joke.
When a thunderous pounding erupts in the kitchen, he deadpans,
``They're beating up a couple of Belgians back there.''
</P>
<P>
   Whaley's sense of humor works like yeast in ``Joe the King.''
But what really saves the movie from sinking into simple pathos is
his decision to focus on his protagonist in adolescence. At 9, Joe
is inescapably a victim. At 14, he has begun to contend with his
lousy circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   His tactics are hustle and evasion. This is a boy navigating in
a sea of adults who, with few exceptions, either ignore or injure
him. His teachers get on him about the money they've been dumb
enough to lend his endlessly cadging father.
</P>
<P>
   As played by Karen Young (in a performance so beautifully
contained that Whaley instructed his child actors to make her their
model), his mother is a once tender woman cauterized by abuse and
disappointment. She takes the brunt of her husband's violence,
partly to deflect it from her children. But suffering deforms more
than it ennobles.
</P>
<P>
   Whaley expresses gratitude for his own mother, Josephine
Timilione, who he thinks married his father because ``she wanted a
little danger.'' But ``the pain and the pleasure kind of mangled
her,'' he adds.
</P>
<P>
   In the film, Joe's mother bullies the boy but occasionally gives
him a treat, when she's not altogether withdrawn. So he does his
best to duck his tormentors and look after himself. He has a decent
older brother, but Joe is essentially a loner.
</P>
<P>
   He works long nights washing dishes in a greasy spoon. He's also
an opportunistic thief, well-acquainted with the local pawnbroker.
Sometimes he's an impulsive thief as well, stealing things he can't
use or sell, like the tampon he nabs from a classmate's locker. He
squirrels it away in his secret hideout under the family's shabby
house, to take apart and examine later. (He really is raising
himself; nobody's teaching him anything.)

DEFENSIVE END   HAS TAKEN LONG AND WINDING ROAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ The song ``Long and Winding Road'' may have
been a hit for the Beatles, but it also describes Ferric Collons's
NFL career.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots defensive end has endured many twists and turns in
his five-year NFL career and at one time left New England for
another team, but somehow hasn't played an NFL game for anyone
other than the Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   Collons was released after last season by the Patriots because
his salary was scheduled to increase from $525,000 to $2.1 million.
The Patriots had given Collons a two-year contract after the
Philadelphia Eagles signed him to an offer sheet as a restricted
free agent after the 1997 season.
</P>
<P>
   In order to retain Collons's services, the Patriots had to match
the Eagles' offer, even though the second-year salary was
prohibitive, given salary cap restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots and Collons's agent, Angelo Wright, engaged in
bitter negotiations before the Eagles tendered their offer.
</P>
<P>
   And when the Patriots elected not to pick up the second year, an
angry Wright said he failed to understand why the team didn't try
to negotiate a decreased salary rather than a release.
</P>
<P>
   Wright even began to file a suit against the Patriots because
Collons was injured at the time.
</P>
<P>
   But when Collons went on the free agent market, the Oakland
Raiders signed him to a two-year deal. Collons was pleased, since
he calls the Bay Area home and his wife is an orthopedic surgeon at
a San Francisco hospital.
</P>
<P>
   While feeling he did a good job in Raiders camp, Collons did not
survive the final cut. The road was about to take another turn.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the Patriots' defensive line was as thin as it
could be. Henry Thomas had missed training camp with a torn
shoulder tendon, Chad Eaton had missed some time with sore knees,
Willie McGinest was still trying to come back from groin injuries,
and Brandon Mitchell had broken his hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be perfectly honest, the phone rang two hours after I got
cut and I didn't entertain (going) anywhere else,'' said Collons.
``I was sitting around my house with my family. I was surprised
they called, but as I've found out, it's a business. Personal
feeling and emotions can't enter into it on my part or theirs.
</P>
<P>
   ``And this is where I wanted to be anyway. I never wanted to
leave. It wasn't my choice. I had no control over that situation.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots definitely adhered to the adage ``in confusion
there is profit,'' for they made out like bandits in a situation
they appeared to botch, lopping $2.1 million off their 1999 payroll
and re-signing Collons for the $400,000 veteran minimum.
</P>
<P>
   Does Collons harbor any hard feelings about being let go
originally?
</P>
<P>
   ``You would not be human if you weren't upset about that. But
sometimes you put yourself second for other people,'' Collons said.
</P>
<P>
   Collons was happy to return to the team that had originally
acquired him Aug. 25, 1995 for ``past considerations,'' which meant
dinner at then Patriots general manager-coach Bill Parcells's
favorite restaurant. It's one of the trades that Parcells and Green
Bay Packers GM Ron Wolf make.
</P>
<P>
   Usually the two star executives try to help improve the other's
team _ though the last trade, when Green Bay sent quarterback irer to the Jets _ hasn't worked out yet. Parcells needed a run
stopper, and Wolf had just the guy. Collons wasn't needed in Green
Bay line.
</P>
<P>
   It was a perfect fit for the Patriots. Parcells came to like
Collons's attitude and his obvious abilities to contain the run.
</P>
<P>
   Collons has been both a front-line player, when he made 13
starts last season, and a role player, such as this year. But
what's becoming obvious is that Collons will have to play more, for
he is an impact player.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he makes such a difference to our defense,'' said
Eaton, one of Collons's biggest fans whose constant boosting of
Collons to coach Pete Carroll and the front office helped get him
another deal with the Patriots. ``He's a force on the edge, and
having him do what he does helps us control the other team's
running game. He just does it so well.''
</P>
<P>
   Collons admits his name doesn't show up much in the statistics.
He won't have many sacks. Though the Patriots have typecast him as
a run stopper, the 6-foot-7-inch, 300-pound Collons would like
nothing more than to be unleashed toward the quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's when it gets fun, but there are a lot of people on this
team who play roles,'' said Collons. ``That's the way they set this
team up. You have to deal with those things.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last four years I've been here, I just do what they ask
me. I give them everything I have on the field and take it from
there. I can't control my playing time or when they play me and
when they don't play me. I'm trying to progress in a positive
fashion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just look at the stats and you'll see I don't get a lot of
sacks, but that's not what they ask me to do. They ask me to go out
there and shut down the running game and I do that to the best of
my ability. Five years ago when I got here I never played on
running downs. I always played on third down. Now, I never see a
third down. I do what they ask me to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Collons has heard all the questions about the
Patriots' AFC East showdown Sunday against Miami in Foxborough.
He's been asked whether his team has exceeded expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hasn't exceeded anything,'' he said. ``This team will go as
far as we allow ourselves to go. Strange things happen in this
game. We won't go far if we shoot ourselves in the foot. I don't
see why you wouldn't expect a lot from this team. The core guys
have been together a long time. We're not going to quit.''
</P>
<P>
   Collons never did. That's why the long, winding road has led
him, again, to New England.

 UNDATED: him anything.)  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Joe is also given to fits of compulsive eating, as well as acts
of unexpected generosity. As he wolfs down a stolen box of Ho Ho's,
some children who are obviously as poor as he is draw near to
watch. He looks at them for a moment and then shares.
</P>
<P>
   When he was growing up, Whaley says: ``I would go to other kids'
houses and they'd open the cupboard and it would be full of food.
And it was like opening the doors of heaven. And I'd say, `Why
aren't you eating that?' And they'd say, `We'll eat it later.' And
I'd think, `Eat it  &UR; now. &LR; '''
</P>
<P>
   Smiling, he says of Noah Fleiss, the young New York actor who
plays Joe: ``He's a happy kid. His parents are professionals. He's
got a cell phone. He's never been hungry. He'd start to eat a
cookie, and I had to say, `No, man, you've got to shove that cookie
into your mouth. Or they're going to take it from you.'''
</P>
<P>
   Like that of Peter Tambakis, who plays the younger Joe, Fleiss'
performance conveys a pervasive sense of deprivation. It's there in
his slight frame and the denim jacket and jeans that seem to be his
only clothes, and most of all in the unnervingly old look in his
eyes, a mix of wariness, cynicism and resignation. One thing Joe is
being deprived of is his childhood.
</P>
<P>
   That the performances in ``Joe the King'' are consistently
excellent may be due in part to Whaley's experience directing and
acting onstage. That, and an enticing script, helped attract an
extraordinary array of name talent to his film.
</P>
<P>
   Ethan Hawke, a close friend with whom he founded the
Off-Broadway theater troupe Malaparte, is all but unrecognizable in
the film as a pudgy, distracted guidance counselor whose clumsy
attempt to help Joe turns out to be the boy's undoing. Hawke says
he gained weight not for the role but in empathy with the pregnancy
of his wife, Uma Thurman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was empathetically eating chocolate bars in bed,'' he says,
laughing. ``I think Frank got some sort of perverse pleasure out of
making Val and me look as disgusting as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Hawke's attachment to the project helped raise the money for it,
as did John Leguizamo's. Leguizamo plays the one friendly adult in
Joe's life, a womanizing waiter who warns him to stop gobbling
leftovers off the customers' plates because he might catch
something and then, barely pausing for his subconscious to take a
breath, launches into a lewd rhapsody about oral sex.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, somebody had to tell him,'' jokes Leguizamo, who shot his
scenes over three very long days in June 1998, commuting between
the film's Staten Island location and the Broadway theater where he
was doing his hit one-man show, ``Freak,'' also a tale of errant
sons and a fearsome father.
</P>
<P>
   Leguizamo is the executive producer of ``Joe the King.'' His
company, Lower East Side Productions, helped raise the $1.7 million
budget, and he helped convince Kilmer to play the all-important
role of the father. If the movie is about the son, the father is
still the pivot on which the boy's future turns.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it's fitting, then, that Whaley is never more eloquent,
sometimes painfully so, than when talking about his father, who,
before he left the family for good, tried to warn his 16-year-old
son away from his own destructive path.
</P>
<P>
   This is one of a scattering of moments Whaley hoards like
treasure _ an ``expression of love from this ghost of a man,'' he
calls it. Although he later gave his father money and tried to help
him to a better life, they were estranged when Robert W. Whaley
died a decade ago of alcohol-related illness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think now that the demons began very slowly to enter his
body,'' Whaley says. ``When I first remember him, he was my age,
mid-30s, and he was a beer guy, he drank a lot of beer, and I
thought he was pretty charismatic. But alcohol is like heroin or
any drug. So 10 years later he was drinking $2 whisky at 11 in the
morning. That was his destiny, I think. He was born into that life;
his father was that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I'm angry that he didn't do things differently. The
guy had a job. It wasn't glamorous, but those guys, after 25 years
of working that job, they can make a nice income. A lot of his
buddies had two-car garages, they had nice lawns and they had nice
families. They had a basketball net in their driveway; they went to
the supermarket on Sunday. He had a family! Guys like that, all
they can hope for, they're not going to seek fame or fortune, but
they can raise up their kids the right way. And watch them grow.
And then when they're 65 or 70 years old, they can say: `That's my
son. Look at him, he wrote a movie.'''

 &HT;    S.C. next to face lottery question
 &HT;    By Marlon Manuel
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTGOMERY, Ala. _ Gambling opponents can cross Alabama off
their list of lottery-friendly states. Next in their cross hairs is
South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   There, voters not only are expected to decide whether to start a
lottery but also whether to keep an unregulated, undertaxed video
poker industry. The state Supreme Court was expected to rule today
on whether to allow next month's video poker vote to proceed.
</P>
<P>
   Despite more than a year of campaigning, Alabama Gov. Don
Siegelman couldn't persuade voters Tuesday to approve a
Georgia-style education lottery he projected would raise $150
million a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no plans to come back with a lottery proposal,''
Siegelman said during an office news conference Wednesday. ``Never
say never, but I have no plans. I think the people spoke pretty
clearly.''
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Zeb Little, who sponsored the legislation that would
have set up the lottery, said the issue is dead ``at least for
several generations. I don't see that changing.''
</P>
<P>
   Next year, South Carolina voters will consider a similar
referendum. Anti-gambling forces are hopeful voters will take a cue
from Alabama, where the issue lost in 47 of 66 counties.
</P>
<P>
   ``It tells me people in the Deep South are taking a long, hard
look at gambling and not just stepping in line to do what everyone
else is doing,'' said Scott Vaughan, director of marketing for the
state Baptist Convention in South Carolina. The group represents
750,000 members in 2,000 churches.
</P>
<P>
   Alabama's Baptist Convention united clergy from all religions to
kill a lottery proposal that looked like a sure bet just two months
ago. Despite polls throughout the decade that gauged statewide
lottery approval at nearly 65 percent, more than 54 percent of
Tuesday's voters rejected the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   A similar scenario could play out in South Carolina. Like
Alabama, South Carolina is mostly rural with few urban centers,
said Brooks Holifield, a professor of American religion at Emory
University.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina and Tennessee, where state legislatures have
debated the lottery for years without resolution, are less
susceptible to the political sway of Southern Baptists because of
larger cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more of a factor in Southern states than any other part
of the U.S.,'' Holifield said. ``They set the tone. But when you
have large urban centers, you have more religious diversity.''
</P>
<P>
   Current polls show lottery support in South Carolina at 50
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Alabama's lottery rejection is an isolated incident or
the first sign of a gambling backlash may become clearer next
month.
</P>
<P>
   ``In conjunction with what could be the defeat of video poker in
South Carolina, it sends a signal that some states are rethinking
the rush to gambling of one form or another. That would be a
significant trend nationally,'' said Whit Ayres, a Roswell,
Ga.-based Republican pollster who once worked for former South
Carolina Gov. David Beasley.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show voters favor banning the video poker machines, which
pervade gas stations, restaurants, bowling alleys, hair salons and
hotels throughout the state. However, representatives of the $2.8
billion industry went to court to try to stop a referendum on the
issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``South Carolina voters are smart enough to know the differences
between a lottery and video poker,'' said Kevin Geddings, who will
lead the pro-lottery campaign on behalf of Gov. Jim Hodges.
</P>
<P>
   In November, Hodges was elected on the promise of an education
lottery, just like Siegelman.

INDEPENDENT COUNSEL CLEARS BABBITT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ariz., Wis.) (rk) 
 By DAVID JOHNSTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Ending an investigation that had haunted Interior
Secretary Bruce Babbitt for 19 months, an independent counsel
announced Wednesday that she had uncovered insufficient evidence to
warrant charges against Babbitt or anyone else involved in his
agency's handling of a American Indian gambling project.
</P>
<P>
   The statement by the prosecutor, Carol Elder Bruce, represented
a decisive dismissal of the allegations against Babbitt after an
investigation that centered on whether the secretary lied in
congressional testimony in 1997 about an Interior Department
decision to deny an application by three Indian tribes to operate a
casino in Hudson, Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   In her statement, Ms. Bruce said that her investigation, which
included interviews with 450 witnesses and examination of more than
630,000 pages of documents also found no evidence of criminal
conduct in connection with the Interior Department's rejection of
the casino project. The investigation of Babbitt also focused on
allegations that political contributions to the Democratic party
influenced the department's decision.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Bruce said in her statement that the evidence ``would
not support a finding of a criminal `quid pro quo,' an explicit
agreement between any opponent of the casino application and any
government official involved in the Hudson decision to perform an
official act in exchange for a political contribution.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Ms. Bruce said that she and her staff concluded that
``the evidence was insufficient to prove that Babbitt violated the
statutes prohibiting perjury and false statements in his Senate
testimony.'' Ms. Bruce said she would present a more detailed
discussion of the evidence and her findings in a report that she
will submit to the three-judge panel that appointed her.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor's statement represented a powerful vindication
for the 61-year-old Babbitt. But the long investigation had been an
unexpectedly painful test of political survival for a former
two-term Arizona governor from one of the state's oldest and best
known merchant and ranching families who arrived in Washington in
1993 with greater star power than almost anyone else in the
Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Babbitt said he was pleased by the outcome. ``I
am, of course, gratified that the grand jury and independent
counsel have determined after an exhaustive investigation that no
charges are justified in this matter,'' Babbitt said. ``That is not
surprising, as I have said from the beginning, all the employees of
the Department of Interior who participated in the Hudson casino
decision acted with complete integrity,''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   With the appointment of Ms. Bruce in February 1998, Babbitt
became one of five Clinton cabinet officers to undergo criminal
investigation by an independent counsel, in addition to Kenneth
Starr's inquiry of Clinton. Together, the cases fed a furious
congressional debate over the independent counsel law that ended
when the statute expired in June without being renewed.
</P>
<P>
   Only one independent counsel inquiry involving a Cabinet
official remains unfinished. That investigation of Labor Secretary
Alexis Herman, which was unaffected by the law's expiration, is
focused on allegations that she engaged in a plan involving
kickbacks and illegal campaign contributions _ although Attorney
General Janet Reno in seeking an outside investigation said she had
uncovered no direct evidence of a crime.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Clinton expressed satisfaction with the outcome of
the Babbitt investigation. ``I am very pleased by today's
announcement concerning Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt,'' Clinton
said. ``As I said at the beginning of this inquiry, Bruce Babbitt
is a man of the highest integrity, and I was convinced that he
would be vindicated. Secretary Babbitt's record of superb
stewardship of our nation's lands speaks for itself, and I look
forward to his continuing service to our country, its people and
its extraordinary God-given resources.''
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt had been under scrutiny since Janet Reno referred the
case, after intense debate among her circle of advisers, to a
three-judge independent counsel panel that selected Ms. Bruce, a
former federal prosecutor, to investigate the allegations against
the interior secretary.
</P>
<P>
   The Babbitt inquiry, coming at a time when the White House was
already buffeted by multiple investigations into Clinton's
relationship with a former intern, into campaign finance and into
other Cabinet officers sharpened the impression of serious ethical
laxity within the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, from the start, Babbitt said he had played no role
in the Interior Department's decision to deny the casino permit and
said that the deliberations reflected the Interior Department's
policies on Indian gambling operations.
</P>
<P>
   But Babbitt's account was challenged by Paul F. Eckstein, a
lawyer, former classmate and law partner of the interior secretary,
who lobbied in favor of the permit. Eckstein said that Babbitt told
him of a White House lobbying effort to kill the casino deal. After
the decision, victorious tribes who opposed the casino permit gave
$230,000 to the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 30, 1997, Babbitt told the Senate governmental Affairs
Committee that the decision to reject the casino was made by a
senior career civil servant at the Interior Department and said
that political considerations had not influenced the permit denial.
</P>
<P>
   But Eckstein said that he spoke with Babbitt two or three times
on the telephone and met with him in the secretary's office on the
day the decision was announced. Eckstein said that Babbitt had told
him that Harold Ickes, then deputy White House chief of staff,
wanted a quick decision on the case.
</P>
<P>
   Eckstein, who was chairman of Babbitt's gubernatorial campaign
in 1982, said that the secretary also asked him whether he realized
how much money the Indians were contributing to the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt said that he did not remember mentioning campaign
donations, but he did not deny that he mentioned Ickes. Babbitt
said that he had mentioned the name of the powerful presidential
aide as a way to usher Eckstein out of his office. In his
congressional testimony, Babbitt said, ``It was just an awkward
effort to terminate an uncomfortable meeting on a personally
sympathetic note.''

CON ED PURCHASE OF NORTHEAST UTILITIEPROVED 
</HEADLINE>

 By PETER HOWE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even as the Red Sox-Yankees pennant playoff whips thousands of
New Englanders into a frenzy of hating all things New York, the Big
Apple's hometown utility announced a $3.5 billion deal to take over
the parent of three New England electric utilities.
</P>
<P>
   ConsolEdison Inc. Wednesday approved a $25-a-share,
cash-and-stock purchase of Northeast Utilities, based in Berlin,
Conn. Northeast is the parent of Western Massachusetts Electric,
Public Service of New Hampshire and Connecticut Light &AMP; Power and
is taking over gas utility Yankee Energy in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, which is not expected to close until the end of next
year, would create one of the country's biggest utilities, with 5
million electric customers and 1.4 million gas customers from
Pennsylvania to New Hampshire and annual revenues of about $11
billion. Customers would continue to get bills and service from
operating companies such as WMECO.
</P>
<P>
   The Northeast takeover accelerates a trend of rapidly
consolidating ownership of New England utilities, including last
month's combination of Boston Edison and Commonwealth Electric into
NStar.
</P>
<P>
   British utility giant National Grid plc, which is in the process
of acquiring New England Electric System and Eastern Utilities, had
been rumored earlier this week to be interested in Northeast
Utilities.
</P>
<P>
   A National Grid spokeswoman said Wednesday the company does want
to pick up more northeastern utilities to build on the NEES
footprint, but only after it has digested the NEES and Eastern
deals, indicating it may not be ready for a bidding war with Con Ed
for Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   Bloomberg Business News reported that Northeast must pay Con Ed
a $130 million termination fee if it breaks off the merger, so a
rival bidder such as National Grid would have to pay $1 a share
more than Con Ed to beat its offer.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Maloney, president of Devonrue Ltd. in Hingham and a
consultant on electric and telecommunications deregulation, said
the Northeast-Con Ed deal ``is one of those combinations that is
just inevitable, and I know we haven't seen the last of these
deals.''
</P>
<P>
   By 2002, New York will introduced competition for electric
supply to its market as Massachusetts did last year. That could
push Con Ed to look for merger partners in New Jersey, Pennsylvania
or elsewhere to get big and efficient enough to cope with
deregulation, Maloney said.
</P>
<P>
   Con Ed chief executive Eugene McGrath said his company and
Northeast ``are natural partners.'' Company officials expect to
save $150 million a year by merging the companies, but said they
will take steps to minimize layoffs and focus on retraining
employees, reducing hiring and leaving vacancies unfilled.
</P>
<P>
   Con Ed said it would pay $25 a share for Northeast, a 17.6
percent premium to the 21 1/4 Tuesday closing price of Northeast
shares on the New York Stock Exchange and up nearly one-third since
the beginning of this month as rumors of a Con Ed or National Grid
takeover began circulating on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   Northeast shares had cratered in 1996 and 1997, dropping below
$10 for a time, during protracted problems restarting its Millstone
nuclear units in Connecticut. The Millstone outage cost the company
$1.5 billion and forced it to stop paying dividends.
</P>
<P>
   Northeast, which recently put two Millstone units up for sale,
is scheduled to pay its first dividend in nearly three years, of 10
cents a share, on Dec. 30.
</P>
<P>
   Con Ed said it will add $1 a share to its bid if Northeast is
able to unload the troubled Millstone 2 and 3 units and also add to
its purchase price for every day the transaction's closing is
delayed past next August.
</P>
<P>
   McGrath will remain chairman and chief executive of the combined
company. Northeast president and chief executive officer Michael G.
Morris will become president of the Con Ed holding company, which
will remain based in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   The merger needs approval from the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission, Securities and Exchange Commission, Nuclear Regulatory
Commission and some state regulators.

 Will Crutchfield is a conductor specializing in 19th-century
opera.  
 By WILL CRUTCHFIELD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Transposition is in the news at the Metropolitan
Opera. Sir Charles Mackerras just concluded a series of
performances of ``Lucia di Lammermoor'' with three large chunks of
the score restored to the higher keys in which the composer
originally wrote them.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time Placido Domingo has been reprising two of his
most celebrated roles, the tragic clown of ``Pagliacci'' and the
tormented Moor of ``Otello,'' with adjustments in the other
direction to accommodate the autumnal range of his tenor voice.
Both circumstances are being discussed extensively _ even heatedly
_ and both are being a bit misunderstood as often as not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Transposition'' in music refers to the collective lowering or
raising of a group of notes, a process that leaves the essential
musical message intact. Yes, they sound different; but a tune that
starts on E is the same tune if you start it on D, as long as you
move all the other notes down by the same distance.
</P>
<P>
   Any piece of music can be transposed, but in professional
practice, it is almost exclusively a vocal issue. An oboe is an
oboe, and what is well written for oboe in one key need never be
moved to another. What is well written for piano or violin may,
indeed, suffer considerably if it is moved, because the mechanics
of execution (just where the violinist shifts from one string to
another, for instance, or which notes are easily accessible to the
pianist's thumb) are so particular that a passage that is
satisfyingly brilliant in one key can become dauntingly awkward in
another.
</P>
<P>
   But singing is a different matter. One soprano, one baritone, is
not like another. Each voice is a unique instrument, and though
there is enough correspondence to allow a great deal of music to
pass from artist to artist unaltered, there has also been a lot of
tailoring as music has been committed to paper.
</P>
<P>
   Whether by rewriting individual lines to add or subtract notes
at the end of the range or by transposing entire pieces, it has
always been necessary to organize a fit between the voices one
wants and the music one wants them to sing.
</P>
<P>
   Such things happen a thousand times a day in the world of
popular song, and no one is concerned; even musicians who are
prepared to take Gershwin's ``Who Cares?'' quite seriously as a
piece of skillful composition (and they should) do not care what
its ``original key'' might have been. The same is largely true in
the world of classical lieder, though pianists know that sometimes
the singer's convenience can add hours to their practice schedule.
</P>
<P>
   But in opera, it's news. The reasons range from a sportive
interest in competitive statistics (how high can Dame Joan
Sutherland still sing this season?), through sensitivity to the
color of a particular key (we tend to think that D major sounds
``military'' and D flat sounds ``warm''), to concern for the
long-range harmonic relationships between one key and another that
were _ sometimes _ important to the way composers conceived their
music over the span of an opera.
</P>
<P>
   Each of these aspects has its complications. The earlier we look
in operatic history, the simpler the answers, for two reasons.
Until, say, Mozart's time or a little after, operas were composed
for specific singers and, if revived at all, recomposed for the new
ones.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the orchestrally accompanied musical units (arias and,
eventually, ensembles) were linked by the keyboard-accompanied
dialogue we call ``recitative,'' whose harmonic structure was
intentionally loose, having no purpose but to prepare the key of
the next piece.
</P>
<P>
   Recitative is infinitely adjustable to accommodate whatever that
next key might be. So Handel transposed his arias all over the map,
a step, a third or a fourth above or below their original keys as
the situation might require, expertly rewriting the instrumental
parts to avoid awkwardness in the orchestra. (If the composer was
not around, the presiding maestro of any operatic season stepped in
to do this job.)
</P>
<P>
   Both these situations changed, and that is the reason we have an
issue today. At more or less the same time, composers moved toward
a more continuous musical texture, reducing and eventually
eliminating the arbitrary nature of the ``linking'' material; and
they began thinking in terms of a coherent artwork that would pass
more or less unaltered from one theater to another.
</P>
<P>
   So singers had to become more adaptable. Then, too, a further
complication was gradually introduced: the exploitation of extreme
vocal notes for their particular character and impact. All the
notes of an aria by Vivaldi or Bach make sense if you play them on
the violin; the same is not true of Verdi, because some notes are
there for a more purely vocal impact.
</P>
<P>
   These changes did not happen in a flash. Different composers
attempted different degrees of continuity and coordination. And
even when those were at their maximum, it remained a matter not of
principle but of the musical particulars of the moment whether a
certain transposition was easy or difficult, justifiable or
questionable, noticeable or hidden.
</P>
<P>
   What is certain is that in all generations before our own,
transposition was practiced a lot more frequently than it is in our
museum-oriented opera houses. The less we do it, the more we talk
about it: just now, the Internet is buzzing with debate over
``Lucia'' and Domingo. But any Met season 50 or 100 years ago
involved far more transposition and far less consternation.
</P>
<P>
   A few examples. We think of the conductor Arturo Toscanini as a
purist, but even at the end of his operatic career, and even in the
shrinelike environment of the Salzburg Festival, he made
transpositions to accommodate his singers in both ``Fidelio'' and
``The Magic Flute.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The latter opera illustrates one frequent cause for
transposition: the Queen of the Night is written for an
extraordinarily high soprano voice, and the voices that are both
sufficiently high and appropriately dramatic are rare. The Queen's
``vengeance'' aria is composed in D minor. Dame Joan was criticized
for singing it in C minor the one time she performed the role, in
the early 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Toscanini was not criticized, as far as I know, for letting his
Queen do the same in the 1930s. At the Met in 1901, Marcella
Sembrich lowered it farther (to B minor), apparently without
raising eyebrows. Nowadays we tend to prefer slighter voices and
the original key; different compromises for different times.
</P>
<P>
   This is only the tip of the iceberg. The beloved Rosa Ponselle
made extensive transpositions in ``Aida,'' ``Il Trovatore,''
``Norma,'' ``La Traviata'' and much else. The baritone aria in
``Faust,'' the tenor arias in ``La Boheme'' and ``Il Trovatore,''
and the bass arias in ``The Barber of Seville'' have probably been
heard as often in transpositions as in their original keys.
</P>
<P>
   It has always been understood that transposition could become a
problem, and in earlier times, composers and singers freely
adjusted vocal lines within the original key to solve problems
without transposing, when that was the more practical solution.
That still happens at the drop of a hat when a new composition is
being prepared, but it has fallen out of favor in familiar operas,
probably because so many listeners have memorized them from
recordings that the adjustments would be too easily commented on,
and singers are shy about revealing their limitation Still, the limitations exist, and it is silly to suppose that
adaptation to them should or could be forbidden. Tenors are
especially prone to need it; we all love the sound of a good
tenor's high range, but the fact is that many fine tenors have the
right sound without having the last few notes their higher
colleagues command.
</P>
<P>
   Tito Schipa, also at the Met, transposed a good deal more of
``Manon'' than Domingo is transposing of ``Otello.'' And yes, it
meant that his co-star had to adjust to some passages lower than
she might have wished. ``Of course it was a little difficult,''
Bidu Sayao, the Manon of one Saturday broadcast that has been
preserved, told me many decades later, ``but he was such an artist
that it was worth the effort.'' Good attitude.
</P>
<P>
   As for the composer's intentions: what is lacking in many
discussions is an appreciation of how flexible and contingent these
were. It is wonderful to see the long-range harmonic structure of
an opera composer who worked that way, but this is not the same as
thinking that the opera is ruined if the structure is modified on
occasion.
</P>
<P>
   Mozart did work that way, but it did not stop him from
transposing afterward when he needed to. Verdi, as far as the
evidence suggests, did not work that way, though he did seem to
care about the local color of individual keys; yet he, too,
willingly transposed all his life.
</P>
<P>
   The case of Verdi is complicated, and this is relevant to the
current ``Otello'' fracas. It's true that he once called for a
contractual right to forbid transposition in his scores, but only
as part of a general program of asserting control over rights,
royalties, cuts and casting that he pursued in the middle of his
career to assure the success of his operas and his (then
unprecedented) right to veto their production when he deemed
success unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   He was dealing with a situation in which Amelia in ``Simon
Boccanegra'' might substitute a Donizetti aria for ``Come in
quest'ora bruna'' (this happened), so his verbal pronouncements on
the matter have to be seen as exaggerations in that context.
</P>
<P>
   But practice was another matter. In ``Rigoletto,'' Verdi
composed Gilda's ``Caro nome'' in F and transposed it himself
before finishing the score. He made a midpiece modulation from G to
F in ``I Lombardi'' specifically to give the soprano high As
instead of Bs, ``because that note is particularly effective'' in
the particular singer's voice. He transposed a high-C showpiece
from the original St. Petersburg ``Forza del Destino'' to B flat
precisely because, as he put it, ``nobody will be able to sing what
was written for Tamberlik.''
</P>
<P>
   Violetta's duet with Germont in ``La Traviata'' went from E to E
flat because for the second production of the opera he had a
lower-voiced baritone; Verdi referred to his revision of this scene
as ``some tranpositions and adaptations for the new cast,'' though
in fact he also made other improvements: the reason he had the
second version published in place of the first.
</P>
<P>
   Even his oft-quoted letter objecting to the transposition of
``Celeste Aida'' is followed by one saying, in effect, ``OK, give
the permission, but let's not let this become a habit.'' (Verdi
also approved, advised and practiced copious local rewriting for
the sake of vocal comfort, up to and including his last opera,
``Falstaff.'')
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   And Verdi's predecessors did all this even more than he. In the
case of Donizetti and ``Lucia,'' it is probably exaggerated to call
the current Met production a different ``version'' of the score. A
different approach, yes, because Sir Charles has rethought the
embellishments from the ground up. He has also restored many cuts;
but so did the team that performed the opera with Edita Gruberova a
few seasons back.
   Still, ``Lucia'' at the Met, even at its most transposed and
altered, has always been closer to the composer's original than,
say, ``Giulio Cesare'' or ``The Tales of Hoffmann'' have been.
</P>
<P>
   As for the keys: since the Lucia arias have traditionally been
sung in lower keys and very high notes have been added at their
conclusions, it has been easy for many to assume that the high
notes are the reason for the transpositions. But history does not
bear this out; the Lucia arias were being sung (and published) in
the familiar transpositions within a decade of the opera's
premiere, long before the ultrahigh added notes became standard.
</P>
<P>
   The evidentiary record, for those who enjoy poring through it,
is clear that as late as the turn of the expiring century, more
Lucias sang the role without high E flats than with. And yet they
were singing in the lower keys. It is much more a matter of the
usual reason for transposition: general vocal ``fit'' between
singer and music.
</P>
<P>
   The gradual fossilization of certain ``standard'' interpolations
_ in this opera and in many others _ was a phenomenon of the
post-World War I period, as the few surviving operas from the age
of improvisation were equipped for life in an operatic environment
no longer hospitable to improvisation.
</P>
<P>
   So everybody should lighten up. Wagner was the most continuous
and least transposable of opera composers (and he sensibly avoided
unusual high notes, probably in part for that reason); yet even
Wagner accepted transpositions for the abandoned first production
of ``Tristan,'' and certain transpositions have functioned well
enough in his scores. Helen Traubel always sang Brunnhilde's Battle
Cry in B flat, not B. At Bayreuth itself, Senta's Ballade was
transposed upward for the young voice of Anja Silja (just as the
little aria of Mozart's Masetto is usually transposed up for the
youngish baritones who sing the part).
</P>
<P>
   It's all a matter of practicality, not principle. If the
transition can be made with some harmonic elegance, and if the
musical loss is either negligible or, at worst, small enough to be
outweighed by the performance it makes possible, then _ no big
deal. If it can't be, then one decides, OK, that singer can't do
that role.
</P>
<P>
   The ``overall harmonic conception'' is important to the
composer's inspiration if it is _ and sometimes it is. But as the
composers themselves knew, that takes its place among many other
priorities when it comes down to what happens on the individual
night, and sometimes it can yield.
</P>
<P>
   As for Domingo, meanwhile: if Verdi had not opened up his
autograph score and scratched out some key signatures, ``Otello''
itself would be with ``Lucia'' and ``Norma'' on the list of operas
that changed between manuscript and publication. The quartet in Act
II, where Desdemona asks her husband's pardon and Iago finagles the
famous handkerchief from his wife, was originally composed in B.
Verdi moved it to B flat during rehearsals, and though we have no
correspondence on the matter, the reason could hardly be more
obvious: as written, the piece required two sustained high Bs, a
note Otello is otherwise required to touch only briefly.
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to surmise, from what we know of Francesco Tamagno,
that these were difficult for the original singer of Otello,
especially given the lyrical context of the lines in question.
</P>
<P>
   If Tamagno had needed the other transpositions that are being
used at the Met, would Verdi have provided them? Or would he have
made local adjustments in the vocal part to render them
unnecessary? Or would he have said, ``All right, too much, let's
get another singer''? We can't know.
</P>
<P>
   If he were around right now, and ``get another singer'' meant
forgoing the services of a beloved artist who had much to offer, in
a role whose distinguished exponents are painfully rare _ well, I
don't think there's a lot of doubt here.
</P>
<P>
   The important thing to remember is that what happens on a given
evening cannot really ``damage'' a musical score. It is still
there, and nothing prevents its being performed unaltered another
day. The moment an Otello of comparable caliber arrives who is
comfortable with the original keys (as our current one was from
1976 until now), those keys will be right there waiting for him.
Meanwhile, rest easy, Maestro Domingo; the ghost of Verdi is on
your side.

 &HT;    Delta ends alliance with Swissair to concentrate on Air France
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The divorce is final.
</P>
<P>
   Delta Air Lines said Wednesday it is ending its long-standing
marketing alliance with Swissair, Sabena and Austrian Airlines to
concentrate on closer ties with Air France.
</P>
<P>
   Delta marketing chief Fred Reid diplomatically called the move a
``difficult decision,'' but it was one that had been widely
expected since Delta and Air France said last spring they would
form a new global alliance.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement immediately strained Delta's ties with
Swissair, which views Air France as a competitor for the
trans-Atlantic passengers it has shared with the Atlanta-based
carrier.
</P>
<P>
   Both Swissair and Delta in recent months sold their stock
holdings in each other, and Swissair has made preliminary moves
toward new ties with American Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   The demise of the Delta-Swissair alliance ends a long and tight
relationship that was among the first of its kind. Over the years,
many thousands of passengers booked by Delta have flown Swissair
flights under their ``code share'' pact.
</P>
<P>
   But Delta in 1997 established ties with Air France and last year
decided to make a major push to build those links into a new
branded alliance.
</P>
<P>
   That alliance, which has not yet been named, also includes
AeroMexico and is expected to include an Asian partner.

   Delta hopes to be able to generate more code-share business with
Air France, whose hub at Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris is much
bigger than Swissair's in Zurich.
</P>
<P>
   Delta and Air France hope to build a multicarrier alliance that
will rival other pacts such as the Star Alliance, which includes
United, Lufthansa, Thai Airways and Brazil's Varig, among others.
</P>
<P>
   Delta said it will continue to book passengers on code-share
flights with Swissair, Sabena and Austrian through the end of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   Swissair, Sabena and Austrian all fly to Atlanta, with Delta
filling some seats on their planes. It remains to be seen whether
the end of the alliance will affect those flights.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Delta is expected to gradually expand the number of
Air France flights on which it sells seats, but no specific
announcements have been made.

<TEXT>
<P>
   REDDISH KNOB, Va. _ President Clinton said Wednesday that he
would permanently protect at least 40 million acres of federal
forest land from road building, logging and mining, using
administrative actions meant to outmaneuver powerful opponents in
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Standing in front of a spectacular fall vista here on the edge
of the Shenandoah National Park _ and next to the grandson of
Gifford Pinchot, who mapped out the first protected forests under
President Theodore Roosevelt _ Clinton said, ``We're going to have
a big fight on this for about a year.''
</P>
<P>
   Later he said, ``In the end, we're going to protect all this
before it's too late.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the strategy described Wednesday by Clinton's top aides,
the Forest Service will speed through hearings and issue
regulations by the end of next year that will prevent any type of
development in the remote sections of national forests that have
never had roads, and in other underdeveloped areas of the 192
million acres the agency manages.
</P>
<P>
   They would include the North Fork of the American River in
California, the Pagoda Peak Roadless Area in Colorado, and the
South Quinault Ridge in Olympic National Forest in Washington. Most
of the newly set aside land would be in tracts of 5,000 acres or
more that are undeveloped, but not protected by formal wilderness
designation.
</P>
<P>
   The protection of so much land would be one of the most
significant conservation actions taken by the administration, which
has fought bitter battles over the use of public lands. The
directive Clinton issued Wednesday affects far more acreage, for
example, than the preservation of 1.7 million acres of the
mineral-rich Grand Staircase Escalante in Utah.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, which has been pressed by Vice President Al Gore and
Clinton's chief of staff, John Podesta, has been debated heatedly
since the administration first floated the idea early in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton went out of his way to credit Gore, who was in Los
Angeles, seeking an endorsement from the AFL-CIO. At one point,
Clinton referred to conservation efforts ``taken under the
administration of Vice President Gore _ and me.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's action was applauded by conservation groups, which
the White House had invited to this remote peak overlooking the
Little River Roadless Area, another of the forests that would be
protected under the new rules.
</P>
<P>
   But the action was denounced by the timber and paper industries
and legislators from states, mostly in the West, where logging in
the national forests is big business.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Ted Stevens, the Alaska Republican who chairs the Senate
Appropriations Committee, has opposed including the 17-million-acre
Tongass National Forest in the declaration. So have Sen. Frank H.
Murkowski and Rep. Don Young, both Alaska Republicans who chair the
House and Senate committees that oversee the Forest Service.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a grand slam,'' said Ken Rait, the director of the
Heritage Forests Campaign, a conservation group financed by the Pew
Charitable Trusts. ``Future presidents would have to go through the
same type of review process to undo this, and we think that's
politically impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   But other environmental groups were far more cautious in their
endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's simply premature to say that this is a great thing,''
said Carl Ross, executive director of Save America's Forests, a
coalition of environmental groups based in Washington, D.C. ``All
he's doing is setting in motion a study, which may or may not lead
to more protection in the end. It's preservation, with a big
asterisk, and maybe with loopholes.''
</P>
<P>
   Ross said the protections also fell short of those in a bill
sponsored by Sen. Robert Torricelli, the New Jersey Democrat, which
would essentially ban clear-cut logging on the nation's public
forests altogether.
</P>
<P>
   And the environmentalists were also concerned that Wednesday's
announcement left open the fate of the Tongass National Forest. It
is one of the world's largest remaining temperate old-growth rain
forests and has long been at the heart of a legal battle zone
pitting conservationists against logging companies, both seeing
immense value in the forest's vast stands of cedar, hemlock and
spruce.
</P>
<P>
   ``This could be one of the greatest environmental protection
measures in the country's history, but it has to include the
Tongass,'' said Matt Zencey, campaign manager for the Alaska
Rainforest Campaign, an environmental group. ``It is the largest
national forest, and it is the poster child for everything that
could be right or could be wrong with the country's forests.''
</P>
<P>
   But if environmentalists expressed some mixed feelings about
Clinton's announcement, logging industry representatives and many
Western Republicans were unshaking in their disdain for the whole
proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a tremendous state of frustration in our industry _ I
mean, who is going to argue with the idea of protecting national
forests?'' said W. Henson Moore, president of the American Forest &AMP;
Paper Association and a former congressman from Louisiana. ``You
can give a beautifully crafted speech, which President Clinton is
very good at doing, and make the American people feel very good
that we're going to stop these evil people from cutting trees down,
but that's not what's going on here at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore said the protections outlined by Clinton amounted to ``an
extremist form of preservation'' that could lead to the loss of
thousands of jobs and that would subject the forests to fire and
disease hazards.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main reason roads are built is to keep the forests
healthy,'' he said, ``to get out dead and dying trees that can
build a fuel load and cause a catastrophic fire, which happened on
5 million acres in the past year alone. Now the extreme
environmentalists will say, that's right, a forest burning down is
all a part of the natural cycle and that's OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Larry Craig, a Republican from Idaho, was equally caustic
in his criticism, and said Clinton was wrong to try to impose
unilaterally a decision that should have been up to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an attitude in this administration that not only does
King William want to reign, he appears at this moment to be setting
up a monarchy for Prince Albert,'' Craig told reporters Tuesday,
criticizing the president in advance of his public announcement.
``These are not the king's lands, th the people's lands, and
we think he ought to come to the people's bodies to form and shape
this kind of policy.''
</P>
<P>
   The plan outlined by the president, however controversial, could
well amount to one of the most sweeping land-preservation measures
in the nation's history. Roosevelt added more than 100 million
acres to the national forest system in his tenure, and the National
Park System, created under a single agency in 1916, started with
about 7 million acres and has grown over subsequent decades to
around 80 million acres in all.
</P>
<P>
   Under Forest Service rules, most national forests can be used
for logging and some types of mining, although much of the property
is not suitable for these uses. About 34 million acres of the
forests _ roughly 18 percent _ have been designated ``wilderness
areas'' by Congress, and are off limits for development.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton cannot expand wilderness areas without congressional
approval, which would be virtually impossible to obtain. So
instead, starting with a notification that is expected to be
published Thursday in the Federal Register, the White House is
creating a another class of Forest Service lands, only slightly
less protected than wilderness areas. That category of roadless
areas would restrict a wide variety of activities, chiefly the
construction of new roads. And without roads, it is extraordinarily
difficult to harvest timber.

 REDDISH KNOB, Va.: harvest timber. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Since early this year the Forest Service has enforced an
18-month moratorium on road-building and other development in most
of the areas covered by Clinton's action Wednesday. If all goes
according to the White House plan, the new, permanent ban would be
put in place just as the moratorium runs out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be tight, but we're going to make it,'' Podesta
said, clearly enjoying an outdoor break from his duties in the West
Wing. Clinton flew into the area Wednesday on a helicopter, and
then drove up the mountain _ in a sport utility instead of his
limousine _ along a Forest Service road of the kind he wants to
outlaw.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've already seen a lot of people saying a lot of terrible
things about what I'm doing, saying the world will come to an
end,'' Clinton said, referring to the reaction to news last week
that a permanent ban was on the way. He argued that only 5 percent
of the timber harvested in the United States each year comes from
the national forests, and only 5 percent of that timber comes from
the land protected by his directive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can replace 5 percent of 5 percent of the timber,'' he
said. ``We can't replace these 40 million acres.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also vowed to veto an interior department bill, now
making its way through Congress, that he said was ``loaded up with
special-interest riders that permit overlogging in national forests
and a windfall to major companies that produce oil on federal
lands.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that if the bill stays in its current form, ``I'll send
it straight to the recycling bin.''

A TALK SHOW HOST SPEAKS OUT ABOUT PALESTINIANS TORTURING
PALESTINIANS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JOEL GREENBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   RAMALLAH, West Bank _ Maher Dasuki, a popular talk show host on
a local television station in this Palestinian-ruled town, became
the topic of his own program last week.
</P>
<P>
   Arrested and jailed for 20 days by the Palestinian security
forces after a guest on his program denounced Yasser Arafat, the
Palestinian leader, Dasuki was back in the studio to tell the tale
of his incarceration.
</P>
<P>
   Interviewed by a colleague for more than an hour, Dasuki, 38,
pulled no punches, and the echoes of his remarks are still
reverberating.
</P>
<P>
   He accused his jailers, some of whom had served time with him in
Israeli prisons, of torture. He described how they had blindfolded
and shackled him in a painful position, how they had called him a
collaborator with Israel and abused other prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   Pointing at the camera as he named his interrogators, he defied
them to arrest him again, and received a steady stream of
supportive telephone calls from viewers. There was no disruption of
the broadcast by the Palestinian authorities, nor any official
denial of his account.
</P>
<P>
   Dasuki's imprisonment and forceful television appearance
reflected the contradictions of life under the Palestinian
Authority: arbitrary intimidation on one hand and freedom to
criticize it on the other.
</P>
<P>
   The unpredictable responses of the security forces showed the
peculiar nature of Arafat's authority in the areas he controls,
which often swings from autocratic repression to tolerance of
dissent.
</P>
<P>
   Dasuki's program, on which guests and viewers debate political,
social and economic topics, is broadcast twice a week on two
Ramallah-based television stations. He was arrested at his office
on Sept. 15, several days after guests on the program criticized
the Palestinian Authority for failing to secure the release of
their sons from Israeli jails.
</P>
<P>
   The mother of one prisoner, an Israeli Arab sentenced to life
imprisonment, went so far as to wish Arafat a speedy death. The
object of her anger was Arafat's assent to the exclusion of Arabs
from East Jerusalem and Israel from the lists of prisoners released
under the latest Israeli-Palestinian accord.
</P>
<P>
   The personal attack on Arafat appears to have been too much for
the security forces and the likely cause of Dasuki's arrest, which
Jibril Rajoub, the Palestinian security chief in the West Bank,
attributed to ``security reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   Dasouki's interrogators accused him of ``incitement and
possession of inciteful materials,'' he recalled in the televised
interview last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``The words that recurred in every interrogation session were,
`You insult us,' '' Dasuki said during the interview, which was
conducted by Daoud Kuttab, a prominent Palestinian journalist who
heads the Institute of Modern Media at Al Quds University, which
owns one of the two stations that broadcast Dasuki's show.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Palestinian tortures you as a Palestinian, that's the big
problem,'' Dasuki continued. ``I never imagined that at 2 o'clock
in the morning I would hear screaming and beating of prisoners. The
Islamic Club in thr of town has become a center of torture,
a center of degradation. How does that happen? It should be the
opposite, prisons should be turned into clubs.''
</P>
<P>
   Callers, some of whom declined to identify themselves, praised
Dasuki as courageous, and expressed revulsion at his treatment in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone knows these things are going on,'' said one caller,
Abu Muhammad. ``The authority must put a stop to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Another caller said: ``We want respectable people to govern us,
we don't want to be ruled by security agencies. The Palestinians
reject government by the security forces. We want institutions,
democratic institutions.''
</P>
<P>
   The unhindered interview with Dasuki and the strong viewer
response it evoked showed the ``strengths and weaknesses of the
Palestinian Authority,'' Kuttab said. ``It allows terrible things
like torture, but it also allows people the freedom to say
something about it.''

 &HT;    Georgia fertile territory for private companies
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Georgia has a ``peachy'' small-business economy, Inc.
(Dec. 19) says in a special edition on the nation's 500
fastest-growing private companies.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia and New York have 24 firms each, but Georgia led the
nation in growth by adding seven since last year. California had
the most with 75, followed b with 38, and Virginia and
Massachusetts with 27 firms each.
</P>
<P>
   The 500 companies posted average 1998 sales of $22.1 million and
five-year average sales gains of 1,715 percent. Inc. says 46
percent are computer-related businesses, 15 percent provide
business services and 10 percent offer consumer goods and services.
</P>
<P>
   The five fastest-growing Georgia companies on the list are CFC
Refimax, a Marietta refrigerant recycler at 55th place; IntelliNet,
an Atlanta software company, 76th; Datamatics Consultants, Duluth
computer consultants, 81st; CodeSoft International, an Atlanta
software and consulting firm, 85th; and Lockwood Sign, a Marietta
manufacturer and installer of electric signs, 98th.
</P>
<P>
   COMPUTER REVOLUTION
</P>
<P>
   Management guru Peter F. Drucker, writing in The Atlantic
Monthly (October), looks at the computer-driven information
revolution and concludes that its impact ``is just beginning to be
felt.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as the Industrial Revolution altered our mental maps and
gave rise to industries nobody predicted, e-commerce _ or business
by Internet _ will do the same thing, he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the new mental geography created by the railroad, humanity
mastered distance,'' he writes. ``In the mental geography of
e-commerce, distance has been eliminated. There is only one economy
and only one market. The competition is not local any more _ it has
no boundaries.''
</P>
<P>
   The new knowledge-based industries will depend on attracting,
holding and motivating ``knowledge workers'' _ a term Drucker
coined.
</P>
<P>
   ``When this can no longer be done by satisfying the knowledge
workers' greed, it will have to be done by ... turning them from
subordinates into fellow executives, and from employees, however
well-paid, into partners,'' writes Drucker.
</P>
<P>
   FUTILE CRACKDOWNS
</P>
<P>
   Periodic waves of puritanism inspire politicians to ban alcohol
or tobacco or other drugs. But, says Forbes (Oct. 18), ``history
shows that legislating sobriety achieves nothing _ and may
aggravate the excesses it is aimed at.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes cites research by Indiana University Professor Ruth C.
Engs showing that temperance and similar movements follow
predictable cycles of early success, restrictive laws and eventual
failure. When enough time has passed to forget the failures, the
next cycle begins, leading to new laws.
</P>
<P>
   The irony, says Forbes, is that in each temperance campaign,
``most of the decline in consumption came before the laws took
effect.''

TOKYO: I expected.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the deal was announced in March, Hanawa was clearly under
pressure. Nissan was closer to being broke than most imagined, with
its banks pushing it to find a new source of cash fast and talks
with Daimler Chrysler AG ending abruptly, in an embarrassingly
public way. The company had no mid- to long-term strategy at that
point; it was simply trying to stay alive day to day.
</P>
<P>
   In hindsight, however, an alliance with DaimlerChrysler, roiled
now by its own dramatic management changes and the
take-no-prisoners style of its chief executive, no doubt seems far
less appealing.
</P>
<P>
   Even though some changes at Nissan are uncomfortable _ Hanawa
himself said it was somewhat unsettling how fast decisions were
being made _ he is pleased with the deal he made.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we were totally the same, there would not be stimulus and
inspiration between us,'' he added. ``Sometimes that stimulus is
comfortable, and sometimes it's painful.''
</P>
<P>
   The two men speak with each other often _ ``Between my broken
English and Ghosn-san's Japanese, the gap is getting closer,''
Hanawa said _ but Ghosn is clearly calling the shots now. He has
startled workers by showing up to stroll the assembly lines and ask
questions, not only of senior engineers and managers but also of
workers themselves. He has encouraged the use of e-mail, rarely
used in the past at Nissan, although language has proven to be
somewhat of a barrier.
</P>
<P>
   Sakanoshita, the labor representative, said Nissan's senior
executives had previously visited production lines only for formal
celebrations of new-car introductions. He could recall only one
other time when someone of Ghosn's stature visited the plant at
Musashimurayama, when Takashi Ishihara, Nissan's legendary chairman
in the early 1980s, paid a call.
</P>
<P>
   `` Hanawa seems more Japanese in that when he collects
information, it is after it has worked its way up from the factory
floor through the plant managers to the section chiefs and division
chiefs,'' Sakanoshita said. `` Ghosn skips the process and goes
directly to the factory floor.''
</P>
<P>
   While Sakanoshita is not at all certain he likes Ghosn's common
touch, even he recognizes that Nissan must change. ``It would be
hard for Nissan to avoid,'' he said. ``I'm not sure Renault should
have been the partner we chose, but it is clear that Nissan could
not survive on its own.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite doubters like Sakanoshita, Ghosn is confident he will
have an easier time selling the plan to Nissan than to outsiders.
``Hundreds of people have had a chance to contribute to this inside
the company,'' he said. ``I've met no resistance and had a lot of
good cooperation.''
</P>
<P>
   Has he had any fun in the last six months? He burst into
laughter, then said it was a difficult question. ``It's an intense
job, and I like intense jobs,'' Ghosn said. ``I'll put it this way:
it takes up all your intelligence, all your skill, your capacity to
listen, your humor, your patience. You are fully used in this
job.''

   TROY, Mich. _ Delphi Automotive Systems' run of good news
continued Wednesday with the company announcing strong
third-quarter earnings and continued growth in orders from
companies other than former parent General Motors Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Delphi also announced the creation of a new division, Delphi
Aftermarket, to bolster sales of replacement auto parts. The
company had focused on the warranty-related aftermarket parts, but
now will push into the broader aftermarket parts industry, said
Alan Dawes, chief financial officer.
</P>
<P>
   Dawes said Delphi also continues to look for companies to
acquire, including businesses that now serve the aftermarket.
</P>
<P>
   Delphi employs about 13,000 people in the Dayton area.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our acquisition strategy is truly what I would call
opportunistic,'' Dawes said. Delphi has made inquiries but no
formal bids on other companies.
</P>
<P>
   Delphi is looking for companies that introduce new customers,
bring synergistic technology, or expand the geographic footprint,
Dawes said.
</P>
<P>
   Auto industry analyst Gary Lapidus of Goldman Sachs said he is
encouraged by that stance and by the third-quarter results, which
show strong sales growth and good cash flows.
</P>
<P>
   The world's largest auto parts maker said it earned $136
million, or 24 cents a share, compared with a loss of $214 million,
or 38 cents a share, in the same period last year that was blamed
on a strike at GM plants in Flint.
</P>
<P>
   The results were a penny a share higher than Wall Street
predictions, according to a survey of analysts by First
Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
   Sales totaled $6.8 billion, up 18 percent over 1998 levels. The
company also generated $484 million in operating cash flow during
the quarter, allowing Delphi to make a $300 million pension
contribution.
</P>
<P>
   ``The third quarter is typically a challenging period for us,''
said J.T. Battenberg III, Delphi's chairman, president and chief
executive. ``This year, despite the usual production changes for
the new model year and the seasonality of (customer) schedules, we
were able to post very solid results.''
</P>
<P>
   Lapidus said he was particularly encouraged by the company's
growth in non-GM business.
</P>
<P>
   In the third quarter, Delphi booked $2 billion in business with
non-GM customers, including a deal with Caterpillar that
significantly expands the company beyond its traditional auto
industry base. Delphi also booked $8 billion of new business with
GM.
</P>
<P>
   Dawes said this year's non-GM business bookings total $7
billion, topping 1998's $6.2 billion in total non-GM bookings.
</P>
<P>
   Delphi (NYSE:DPH) stock closed at 15 13/16, down 5/16. The
52-week range was 15 1/16 to 22 1/4.
</P>
<P>
   Dawes and Lapidus both said the company's recent soft stock
market performance is due to overall lack of interest in auto
components businesses. Dawes said the possible spin-off of Ford's
Visteon parts maker could help stock prices by generating interest
in the components sector. Lapidus also said it will create an
opportunity for Delphi to grab some Ford business now done by
Visteon.

TIME OFF TO DIVE INTO REALITY RATHER THAN RETREAT FROM IT  
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, OCT. 17)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Texas, Mo., N.C., N.Y.)  (af) 
 By ANN WILSON LLOYD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a late 20th-century version of J.M.W. Turner's search for the
untrammeled landscape, a small band of contemporary artists is
spending this month trekking in the Himalayas, seeking fresh vision
as well as fresh scenery.
</P>
<P>
   In Salvador, Brazil, artists are working with street children to
bring them back into society. In Kansas City, Mo., artists have set
up shop in a converted downtown garage, while in San Antonio, a
former automobile showroom functions as a high-tech studio.
</P>
<P>
   All are new versions of the artist residency program in which,
traditionally, artists retreat for sabbaticals in bucolic,
cloistered settings like Yaddo or the MacDowell Colony. Now artists
may convene in gritty urban environments, participate in group
living experiments or join far-flung adventures resembling Outward
Bound.
</P>
<P>
   The Himalayan trek, for example, initiated by the Kiasma Museum
of Contemporary Art in Helsinki, Finland, is theoretically about
perception and how new experience rets formation, according
to Maaretta Jaukkuri, the museum's chief curator. Artists may work
while walking, or during a monthlong residency at the museum next
spring. An exhibition will be held in the summer of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Liisa Roberts, a trekker and New York-based artist who is half
Finnish, said before leaving that combining nature, art and
expeditions is not so strange in Finland. Jussi Heikkila, a Finnish
artist who has previously used mountain hiking in his work, came up
with the idea. Ms. Roberts was excited but a little nervous. ``I am
not much of an outdoor person,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Xu Bing, a Chinese artist living in New York and another
trekker, may be more prepared, at least ideologically. The trip
echoes his student days in China during the Cultural Revolution,
when he was sent to live with farmers. Long conditioning marches
were also prescribed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This project is an avant-garde idea in Western contemporary
art,'' he said, ``but it's something they were doing 20 years ago
in China. The project addresses a lot of problems in contemporary
art, where things are missing between the artist and the audience.
A more social-minded approach is needed.'' Perhaps a response to
withdrawal of funds by the National Endowment for the Arts, these
new-style artists' residencies are cropping up everywhere, said
Tricia Snell, executive director of the Alliance of Artist
Communities. The alliance, which started in 1990, has a membership
of 60 nonprofit programs, but there are close to 80 in the field at
large.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twelve have recently opened, 11 more are in planning stages,
40 or 50 people have contacted us about startups,'' Ms. Snell said.
``Here is a grassroots movement much as there was in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   ArtPace, the new program in San Antonio, is where Ms. Roberts
was contacted to discuss the Himalayan trek. ArtPace was founded in
1993 by Linda Pace, a San Antonio artist, benefactor and collector,
whose father developed Pace Picante Sauce. ArtPace residencies,
awarded by nomination, are considered the cream.
</P>
<P>
   A local-global mix of residents is chosen by a panel of
international art professionals or a curator. This year, Okwui
Enwezor, director of the next Documenta, tapped Ms. Roberts, Chris
Sauter from Texas and Oladl Ajiboy Bamgboy from London.
</P>
<P>
   Artists live and work for two months in a sleek new facility
carved from a vintage car showroom, are given private apartment and
studio space, technical support and facilities, a $500 weekly
stipend and an $8,000 budget for supplies. Exhibitions cap the
residency.
</P>
<P>
   ArtPace prides itself on underwriting costly new works. ``The
demise of NEA grants to individual artists and the aftermath of the
early '90s economy diminished opportunities for artists to make
significant, expensive works,'' says Ms. Pace.
</P>
<P>
   It was here that in 1997 Cornelia Parker, a British artist, made
``Mass (Colder Darker Matter),'' an installation of charred remains
from a burned Texas church that was later exhibited in the Turner
Prize show at the Tate Gallery in London. Consequently, San Antonio
has become a preview site for the art world, staff members claim.
</P>
<P>
   In a collaborative first, Isaac Julien, a British filmmaker, is
splitting his residency this fall between ArtPace and a somewhat
similar program, Grand Arts, in Kansas City. It, too, is financed
by a private foundation established by Margaret Hall Silva, a
member of the Hall family of Hallmark Cards. Ms. Silva is also an
artist, though like Ms. Pace, she has found her program eclipsing
personal artmaking.
</P>
<P>
   Grand Arts is in a former garage in downtown Kansas City that
has also undergone an upscale architectural makeover, setting it
apart from nearby pawn shops and parking lots.
</P>
<P>
   Grand Arts is slightly smaller in scope and more fluid than
ArtPace. ``We have no program the artist has to plug into, Ms.
Silva said. ``Each residency is individual.'' The stipend and
budget are customized. Recently Jim Leedy, a local artist, used
Grand Arts state-of-the-art sculpture studio to prepare a large
installation.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the staff was also mapping logistics for Julien's
film project and a project with the New York artist Dennis
Oppenheimer.
</P>
<P>
   Grand Arts residents come from solicited applications, with
final selection made by a revolving panel of national arts
professionals. The center offers, in addition to the sculpture
studio, an elegant on-site apartment and two galleries. As at
ArtPace, Grand Arts' staff says art-world traffic has enlivened the
scene in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Evolving from sources exactly opposite from Grand Arts and
ArtPace, the new Tryon Center for Visual Art, in Charlotte, N.C.,
may be the first residency program to be generated by civic leaders
rather than art ponals. Opening its doors last month with
six artists ranging from local to international, the Tryon Center
has a $7 million endowment given by the Bank of America, which has
its headquarters in Charlotte.
</P>
<P>
   Tryon Center was inity Hugh McColl, the CEO of Bank of
America who has been behind much of the rebirth of downtown
Charlotte. But the new arts center is not necessarily an urban
renewal project, says Barbara Spradling, chairman of the Tryon
board and a Bank of America senior vice president. ``Culture and
visual arts are what make cities great,'' she said. ``We would like
more artists to live here, to help build audience and collectors,
and to fill a gap in Charlotte.''
</P>
<P>
   Tryon Center also filled a gap in the urban landscape _ a
burned-out shell of a neo-Gothic church just blocks from the bank's
downtown corporate tower. The spectacular renovation created 15us studios (almost too handsome for messy art making),
lavishly equipped workshops and high-tech labs for everything from
digital media to printmaking.
</P>
<P>
   Such grand scale corporate largesse stems partly from the fact
that McColl's mother was a painter. ``I like art and want to
support artists,'' he explained. ``I thought of painters living on
the south side of the rebuilt church and painting in north-facing
studios, so it's not exactly as I envisioned it. But my philosophy
is to do something and then be happy with it. And part of the deal
is that artists will give back in some way.''
</P>
<P>
   Tryon's residents are chosen half by nomination and half by the
staff. Residencies are for three months and artists receive
housing, studios, up to $2,500 for materials plus a monthly stipend
of $1,500 to $4,000. In return, community involvement is strongly
encouraged.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, everyday life is the leitmotif of the Quiet in the
Land, a series of ad hoc residency projects created by France
Morin, an independent curator. The first, in 1996 at the Sabbathday
Lake, Maine., Shaker colony, included 10 artists she personally
selected. Now Ms. Morin is in Salvador, Brazil, overseeing the last
of 16 staggered residencies in her second project.
</P>
<P>
   In Salvador, completely removed from the typical pampered
residency and from the art world, artists work with Projeto Axe, a
philanthropic organization that uses the arts to seduce street
children back into society.
</P>
<P>
   ``By sharing powerful histories, first the Shakers and now
children of Axe help artists re-examine relationships of life and
work to the world beyond the narrow confines of the art world,''
Ms. Morin says. ``I cannot say all the artists have had the same
level of experience, but most of them are leaving troubled and
rethinking these relationships.''
</P>
<P>
   Nari Ward, who has participated in both Ms. Morin's projects,
found Brazil incredibly challenging. ``I think artists came on
board thinking they were tired of the old model residency, to flex
themselves a little more,'' he said. ``The Shaker project was a
personal introspection. Brazil is much more a social project, but
both had the same premise _ to take everyday situations and regard
them the way you would art in a museum or gallery. It has
intensified my desire to work more with communities.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone was completely comfortable with the Salvadoran
experience. Kara Walker, who worked with teen-age girls, cited
frustrations with language barriers as well as living close
together in one house with other participants. She recalls vigorous
discussions about why they were there; whether they were artists or
missionaries. ``I wasn't really sure what we were working toward,''
she said, ``but there were moments when something a little bit
magical would happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The art generated from her collaboration with the young women
had a little bit of a high school feel to it, Ms. Walker said
(which may be one reason Ms. Morin and the artists decided not to
show the project's exhibition outside of Salvador as originally
planned). Ms. Walker, who spent four weeks in Salvador, added, ``It
affected my real life more than my working life; it made me
question all that I do.''
</P>
<P>
   These projects stem from Ms. Morin's general dissatisfaction
with the gallery and museum circuit (she was formerly the head
curator at the New Museum of Contemporary Art in New York) and her
desire to work in more intuitive and personal ways. Two more
phases, one at the Parrish Museum on Long Island and another
long-term project in Southeast Asia, for which the artist Chen Zhen
is teaching himself to become a Chinese doctor, are planned.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of their quixotic nature, Ms. Morin is passionate
about their necessity. ``I know these projects are like throwing
pebbles in the water,'' she said. ``But they have an amazing
capacity to ripple outward.''

 &HT;    SENATE VOTES TO REJECT NUCLEAR TEST BAN TREATY
 &HT;    750&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A deeply divided Senate voted Wednesday to reject
an international ban on nuclear test explosions, derailing the
centerpiece of the global non-proliferation agenda and dealing
President Clinton a bitter foreign policy defeat.
</P>
<P>
   The 51-48 vote, split along party lines, plunged the treaty into
a sort of legislative purgatory, ending any near-term prospects for
an objective that has eluded the world diplomatic community since
the dawn of the nuclear age.
</P>
<P>
   Treaty proponents pledged to try to resurrect it after the
current Congress adjourns in January 2001, with some expressing
hope that the accord might be strengthened in the interim.
</P>
<P>
   With polls suggesting that eight in 10 Americans support the
treaty, Democrats also signaled they would use the vote as a
political weapon in next year's elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect that this should be, and will be, a national issue
next year in the presidential elections,'' Senate Minority Leader
Tom Daschle, D-S.D., told reporters. ``And we certainly don't want
to preclude the opportunity from speaking out on the issue on the
Senate floor.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the treaty's Republican opponents carried the day by
rallying around the view that the 154-nation pact would risk
undermining the U.S. nuclear arsenal without sufficiently deterring
the efforts of outlaw states and others to build and test atomic
bombs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a dangerous treaty,'' said Senate Foreign Relations
Committee Chairman Jesse Helms, R-N.C. Perhaps the treaty's most
vociferous opponent in the Senate, Helms assailed the accord as
unverifiable and called it ``the most egregious arms control treaty
ever presented to this body.''
</P>
<P>
   The treaty's proponents, however, said the Senate missed an
historic chance to add an important tool, however imperfect, to
global efforts to limit the spread of the most dangerous weapons on
Earth.
</P>
<P>
   ``My heart aches,'' said Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., who led the
floor debate on behalf of the treaty's proponents. ``This is the
most serious mistake the U.S. Senate has ever made.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., ``With this fateful vote tonight,
the world becomes a more dangerous place.''
</P>
<P>
   In an immediate effort to head off such criticism, Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., ordered a Senate survey of the
global spread of nuclear weapons on Clinton's watch, ``from North
Korea to Iran to Iraq, from China to Russia and from India to
Pakistan.''
</P>
<P>
   Brushing aside critics who said the treaty's rejection gives a
green light to nations wanting to acquire or expand nuclear weapons
capabilities, Lott said Wednesday's vote sent a more important
message.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will defeat bad treaties,'' Lott said. ``We did the right
thing for America.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Clinton was the first head of state to sign the accord,
formally called the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. Since then,
another 153 nations have signed on to the treaty. It cannot take
force, however, without the ratification of 44 nuclear-capable
states, including the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Senate ratification would have required a two-thirds majority
vote. The treaty failed to garner a simple majority, however, as 51
Republicans voted against the measure and only four Republicans _
John Chafee, of Rhode Island, James Jeffords of Vermont, Gordon
Smith of Oregon and Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania _ voted for it.
</P>
<P>
   All Democrats voted in favor of the treaty except Sen. Robert
Byrd, of West Virginia, who simply voted ``present,'' as a protest
against what he regarded as insufficient deliberation and
consideration of the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents levied serious substantive charges against the treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Some, like Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Tex., objected to the
treaty's ban on test explosions so small that the U.S. intelligence
community cannot detect them. Previous presidents, dating to Dwight
D. Eisenhower, had favored a ban on tests of larger bombs that
would have allowed the United States to conduct test blasts of its
smaller and more sophisticated weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Clinton gave that up,'' Hutchison said. ``No other
president gave in on that issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Paul Coverdell, R-Ga., said the treaty ``relies more on
hope than fact,'' and would actually raise the danger of atomic
attack by undermining the U.S. nuclear deterrent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our children deserve to live in a world free from the threat
of nuclear war,'' Coverdell said in a prepared statement.
``However, the ratification of this treaty would have increased our
nation's vulnerability to such an attack.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Near the heart of the debate, however, also lay a fundamental
difference of world view between those senators, mostly Democrats,
who touted the necessity of collective diplomacy and international
agreements and those lawmakers, chiefly Republican, who vest far
less faith in global institutions and treaties.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't know, unfortunately, for another 10 years or so, the
real negative effects of turning down this treaty,'' said Sen. Max
Cleland, D-Ga. ``It's a terrible, terrible, terrifying message to
send.''
</P>
<P>
   Helms, though, scoffed at such talk, saying the key to U.S.
security and influence in a dangerous world is to maintain the
might to command ``a credibility not based on scraps of paper but
on clear American resolve.'''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond any substantive or ideological arguments, the treaty was
undoubtedly roiled by the enmity between Clinton and his Republican
foes at a time of heightened political posturing in the run-up to
next year's presidential and congressional elections.
</P>
<P>
   Helms, for his part, even managed to inject into Wednesday's
debate a dig at Clinton over the sex scandal that nearly toppled
his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Belittling a plea for treaty passage by Prime Minister Tony
Blair of Britain, Helms suggested that Blair weighed in only in
deference to Clinton's request.
</P>
<P>
   ``And he (Blair) will say 'Oh I'll do that, I'll do that _ and
give Monica my regards,' '' Helms said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's relationship with former White House intern Monica
Lewinsky led to his impeachment by the House last year and
subsequent acquittal by the Senate.

PAKISTANIS APPEAR TO ACCEPT COUP BUT WONDER WHAT WILL HAPPEN NEXT 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By CELIA W. DUGGER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ A day after Pakistan's armed forces seized
power and dismissed the elected government of Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif, the people of Pakistan waited expectantly on Wednesday to
find out who will rule them.
</P>
<P>
   Bureaucrats reported for work, but were left in limbo, as some
ministers had been detained by the army. Traders milled about
outside the Karachi Stock Exchange when it failed to open. So didlers at the country's airports, which remained closed on
Wednesday. Pakistani embassies were paralyzed as staff members were
left to wonder exactly what government they would represent.
</P>
<P>
   The army chief, Gen. Pervaiz Musharraf, said in a nationally
televised speech to the nation early Wednesday morning that he
would soon lay out the army's plans, but by late evening he still
had not revealed whether he would impose martial law, call new
elections or install a civilian government controlled by the
military.
</P>
<P>
   During the day, he met for more than an hour with President
Muhammad Rafiq Tarar and with constitutional law experts,
apparently searching for a way to give a veneer of legitimacy to a
naked coup d'etat. In the hours after the prime minister, Sharif,
announced Tuesday that he was firing Musharraf, the army moved to
take power.
</P>
<P>
   It was still not clear on Wednesday exactly where Sharif, his
brother Shabaz and Lt. Gen. Ziauddin Butt, the intelligence agency
head whom Sharif had named to serve as the new army chief, were
being held.
</P>
<P>
   A senior army officer who spoke on condition of anonymity said
they were still under house arrest at the prime minister's
residence. Other reports suggested they had been shifted to an army
mess.
</P>
<P>
   Soldiers on Wednesday arrested key figures in the dismissed
Sharif government, including Brig. Javed Malik, military secretary
to the prime minister, and Mushtaq Tahir, Sharif's political
secretary.
</P>
<P>
   And troops continued to maintain a presence _ albeit a smaller
one _ at Parliament House, the cabinet block, the state-run
television station and the residences of influential ministers of
the dismissed government. They also took over key provincial
government offices.
</P>
<P>
   But there were virtually no signs of public grief on Wednesday
at this latest blow to democracy in a nation that has been ruled by
the military for 25 of its 52 years of independence. Nor were many
shedding tears at the downfall of Sharif, who won in a landslide
electoral victory two-and-a-half years ago but disappointed the
voters' hopes for a stronger economy and an end to public
corruption.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, children went to school and adults went to work. There
were no big public protests against the military's actions. In
fact, the only people demonstrating seemed to be those happy about
the coup.
</P>
<P>
   Even as Pakistan was wondering what kind of government its
military will select, India was celebrating the rituals of the
world's biggest democracy: the swearing in of Prime Minister Atal
Behari Vajpayee as head of a newly elected government.
   The chasm of distrust between India and Pakistan, which have
both tested nuclear weapons and nuclear-capable missiles in the
last year-and-a-half, has yawned wider since this summer when a
conflict over the Himalayan territory of Kashmir nearly turned into
their fourth war. But Vajpayee, a man with a temperate style,
seemed in a magnanimous mood on Wednesday about Pakistan, not an
alarmist one.
</P>
<P>
   He did not rule out restarting talks with Pakistan, even though
India would now have to negotiate with a government controlled by
Pakistani army leaders who many Indians blame for the
Pakistan-supported occupation of portions of Indian-held Kashmir.
More than 400 Indians died this summer battling to drive those
forces out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wish the people of Pakistan well,'' Vajpayee said on
Wednesday. ``We remain committed to developing friendly relations
and cooperative ties with Pakistan based on mutual trust and
confidence for which the government of Pakistan needs to create the
right environment.''
</P>
<P>
   More than any other issue, the Kashmir conflict damaged Sharif's
relationship with the military. Some analysts say army leaders were
angered when the Sharif bowed to American pressure and called for
withdrawal of the Pakistan-supported forces. Others say military
leaders were upset that the prime minister gave the impression that
rogue army officers were to blame for the misadventure, rather than
accepting responsibility himself.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the baldness of Tuesday's power grab by the military,
many Pakistani intellectuals _ people who advocate democracy _ do
not seem outraged about what has happened. As rumors of a possible
coup swirled in recent weeks, scholars, journalists and opposition
politicians have talked about what form a post-coup government
might take.
</P>
<P>
   Ijaz Hussain, chairman of the international relations department
at Quaid-I-Azam University in Islamabad, said one option might be a
government of technocrats whom he described as ``nonpolitical
people who don't have a suspicious past indulging in wrong doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharif's own authoritarian impulses _ his government's crack
down on critics in the press and its decision to curtail public
demonstrations _ badly undermined his credibility, as did his
failure to deliver good government.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not the demise of democracy,'' said Najam Sethi,
editor of the Lahore-based weekly, The Friday Times, who was
himself dragged from his home in the middle of the night and
interrogated for over a month before being released. ``It died a
year or two ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Statements from opposition groups, however, betrayed deeper
indignation, even though they have called on the prime minister to
step down for months, alleging he had misruled the country.
</P>
<P>
   The Pakistan People's Party, led by former Prime Minister
Benazir Bhutto, whose own political life has been shrouded by
corruption allegations, demanded new elections under an interim
government. Ms. Bhutto herself remains in London in a kind of
self-imposed exile.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike previous military coups, Musharraf has so far not
declared martial law, which would dissolve parliament and abrogate
or suspend the constitution. He has thus left the country, for the
time being at least, suspended in a kind of legal and political
limbo.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can very well understand that this is not something that
one expects to happen every day,'' one officer, Brig. Rashid
Qureshi, told the BBC on Wednesday. ``And whatever was done, it was
a spontaneous reaction actually by the army to what actions, and
wrong action, Mr. Nawaz Sharif had taken.''

<P>
   Whatever its motivations, it is nearly certain to place at risk
billions of dollars in loans and assistance from international
lenders and Western governments that Pakistan cannot afford to
alientate.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in Paris, the head of the International Monetary Fund,
Michel Camdessus, said he was ``not certain'' whether the fund
could ofistance to Pakistan after Tuesday's events.
</P>
<P>
   British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said in London that he
would meet with the representatives of Commonwealth nations, which
would consider a ``collective response'' to the coup. ``Any country
under military rule qualifies itself for suspension,'' Cook said.
``As for other steps, it is too early to say.''

TEXAS JURY ACQUITS COUNTRY SINGER 

</HEADLINE>

<P>
   UVALDE, Texas _ Country singer Johnny Rodriguez was acquitted of
murder Wednesday in the shooting death of a drunken acquaintance
who he found in his mother's house in the pre-dawn hours after a
drinking party nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez, whose voice propelled him to country music stardom in
the 1970s, was charged with killing 26-year-old Israel ``Bosco''
Borrego, on Aug. 29, 1998, in the ranching community of Sabinal. If
convicted, he could have been sentenced to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   A jury of six men and six women deliberated two hours before
delivering a verdict that left Borrego's widow and other relatives
in tears and prompted cheers from Rodriguez supporters and extended
family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just sorry that the whole incident took place,'' Rodriguez
said later. ``I don't want to go through anything like this
again.''
</P>
<P>
   He later went up to Uvalde County District Attorney Tony
Hackebeil, hugged him, called him a ``peckerwood,'' and said he had
no hard feelings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a reflection of the conscience of the community,'' the
prosecutor said of the verdict. ``Obviously the jury feels Johnny
was justified in taking the actions he did, even though it resulted
in taking the life of Israel Borrego.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez's lawyers had argued that he was justified under Texas
law to defend himself and his property. The singer's mother was not
living in the house at the time of the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the verdict, local residents had said an acquittal
wouldn't surprise them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Around here if you find somebody in your house at night,
they're toast,'' said a Uvalde gun dealer.
</P>
<P>
   During the trial, the jury learned that Borrego was on felony
probation for four separate burglaries in Sabinal. He also had an
extensive criminal history of arrests for drunk driving, public
intoxication, assault and criminal trespass.
</P>
<P>
   A friend of Rodriguez's testified that Borrego was suspected of
breaking into Rodriguez's home two weeks before the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   However, Hackebeil sought to portray Rodriguez as drunken and
angry _ not fearful _ when he discovered Borrego preparing
breakfast in the kitchen of his mother's home.
</P>
<P>
   And a police officer testified that when he arrived on the scene
after Borrego was shot, Rodriguez was viciously kicking the wounded
man, as he lay moaning on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez is best known for his 1970s hits such as ``Pass Me
By'' (If You're Only Passing Through) and ``Ridin' My Thumb to
Mexico,'' which soared into the Top 10 on the country charts. His
career took a downturn by the 1990s, but he still plays weekend
gigs in South Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think my mind will be a little more clear now. I think I'm
going to cut back on the drinking, too. I've learned a little about
that,'' he told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez has struggled over the years with drug and alcohol
addiction. In 1994, he was jailed for public intoxication after he
and a Nashville guitarist got into a fight in a Weslaco lounge.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez said Wednesday that he had booked a singing date this
weekend in the Houston suburb of Rosenberg ``just in case,'' but he
didn't have definite plans beyond that other than trying to write
some new songs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't think that far ahead right now,'' he said. ``I think
I'm going to go barbecue me some little ribs or something.''

MARKET PLACE: THE FED LEANS IN, AND THE MARKETS PULL BACK 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When the Federal Reserve policy makers want to, they
can still stir the pot on Wall Street. Their Oct. 5 decision to
leave their interest rate target unchanged at 5.25 percent but to
hint at a future increase in rates has left investors uncertain,
tripped up stocks and pushed long-term interest rates near a
two-year high.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks tumbled Wednesday after Intel Corp. announced
disappointing third quarter earnings late Tuesday and interest
rates moved higher. The Nasdaq composite index dropped 2.48 percent
while the Standard &AMP; Poor's index of 500 stocks dropped 2.09
percent. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 1.77 percent.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the yield on the 30-year bond jumped to 6.27
percent, its high since Aug. 12 and just below 6.28 percent in
October 1997. The yield on the two-year note, which is more
sensitive to the threat of Fed interest rate increases, jumped to
5.83 percent, its highest since October 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed policy-makers did not say this was their intent when
they released their statement explaining what they decided after
the policy-making session earlier this month. They would not do
that. But the members of the Federal Open Market Committee are
savvy and had to know that the uncertainty about the next rate
increase would have an impact on the market.
</P>
<P>
   Fed policy-makers have been worrying about the rally in the
stock market all year because the gains are spurring consumer
spending through what is called the wealth effect. Even after
Wednesday's declines, the Dow is up 11.44 percent so far this year,
and the Nasdaq has jumped 27.58 percent this year. Consumer
spending has been the driving force of an economy that is growing
at a 4 percent pace, much faster than the Fed would like.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Reserve Governor Laurence H. Meyer has been talking
about the problem of the stock market and how it effects the
central bank's interest rate policy for some time. He realizes that
the danger of a rate increase to cool the stock market is that
investors could overreact, setting off a big sell-off that could
damage the economy rather than slow it.
</P>
<P>
   Policy-makers, he said in a speech last month, ``should be alert
to the potential that a tightening of policy could have a
disproportionate effect on demand, if it induces a reassessment of
market fundamentals.''
</P>
<P>
   So maybe no rate increase but a lean toward higher rates is a
step in between.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the Fed is disappointed in seeing the stock
market stabilizing or moving lower,'' said Joseph Abate, senior
economist at Lehman Brothers. ``A little bit of uncertainty about
the outlook for monetary policy is not necessarily a bad thing.''
</P>
<P>
   With the sell-off this week, the Dow has given back the 4.3
percent rally that started at the end of September. Equity
investors are jittery, although third quarter earnings overall are
supposed to be strong followed by a good fourth quarter. But if the
interest rate worries subside, the earnings outlook _ backed by
some important companies beating expectations _ could give stocks a
lift again.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Louis Crandall, chief economist at R.H. Wrightson &AMP; Associates,
said that if the Fed had increased its short-term interest rate
target a quarter of a percentage point to 5.50 percent Oct. 5, many
investors would have taken that as a all-clear signal for the year.
And that could have opened the door for stocks to move higher.
</P>
<P>
   What is adding to the negative environment now is the
anticipation of reports of rising inflation in September at both
the producer and consumer levels. Although analysts argue that the
jumps are caused by the recent increases in tobacco prices, in oil
prices last month to just under $25 a barrel, and the subsequent
jump in gasoline prices, they are still disturbing investors.
</P>
<P>
   The core rate for the September producer price index of finished
goods, which excludes food and energy, is forecast to rise 0.5
percent, well above the trend for the year. For the Consumer Price
Index, the core rate is forecast to jump 0.3 percent, the biggest
move since April and well above the trend for the year.
</P>
<P>
   Although economists are telling Wall Street traders that these
jumps in September inflation gauges are not signaling a trend, they
do not want to make you buy bonds a week after Fed policy-makers
said they were leaning toward a rate increase, Crandall said. ``If
buyers see reasons to sit on their hands for a period of time,'' he
added, ``the market suffers for it.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, although September retail sales, which will be
reported Thursday, are expected to slow to an increase of 0.2
percent, that is coming after two months of 1 percent or more
growth. And that means the economy may not be slowing fast enough
to satisfy the Fed.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Crandall said that the threat of a weakening dollar is also
worrying investors. The dollar is down sharply against the yen this
year but has leveled off recently. But it is not yet clear if steps
taken by the Bank of Japan Wednesday will really lead to an easier
monetary policy there that could end the dollar's decline.
</P>
<P>
   But the dollar, which has rallied for most of the year against
the euro, could turn around, especially if growth here slows while
it is picking up in Europe. A steady dollar decline against the
euro, Crandall said, would make investment by Europeans in the
United States less attractive because the weaker dollar would
reduce their returns when translated back into euros. That would
slow foreign investment in both stocks and bonds here, taking away
an important prop for both markets.
</P>
<P>
   However, a rise in interest rates _ home mortgage rates are
still near their highs foyear _ and a modest slump in the
stock market could help change the mood of investors by slowing
economic growth enough to get Fed policy makers less worried about
the tight labor market and rises in wages and commodity prices.

SCIENTISTS DEVELOP A MOUSE THAT RESISTS SOME CANCERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Slug changed from SCI-IMMUNE-MICE to better reflect story
subject.) 
(th) 
 By NICHOLAS WADE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a striking demonstration of the reach of a new anticancer
technique, scientists have developed a strain of mouse that is
immune to certain types of cancer, surviving injections of
malignant cells that quickly raise lethal tumors in normal mice.
</P>
<P>
   The technique is based on the idea of starving tumors by cutting
off their blood supply. Several compounds that inhibit the
formation of new blood vessels _ a process called angiogenesis _
are at various stages of testing and may or may not prove
clinically useful.
</P>
<P>
   The new strain of mice, which is genetically incapable of making
many new blood vessels, shows how effective an anti-angiogenesis
therapy might be if someone could develop a drug that worked as
well in people as the genetic manipulation does in mice.
</P>
<P>
   A team led by scientists at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer
Center in New York developed the mice by deleting two genes that
appear to control the process of angiogenesis. Their work is
described in the issue of the journal Nature that is being
published Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Experts on angiogenesis said that the new finding would help
explain the genetic mechanisms that underlie the formation of new
blood vessels, and that discovery of these mechanisms would provide
a new set of targets against which anti-angiogenesis drugs could be
developed.
</P>
<P>
   Directing drugs against blood vessels rather than the tumor
itself is regarded as particularly promising because cancer cells,
being genetically unstable, can quickly develop resistance to a
drug. But new blood vessels, which are composed of the body's
normal cells, cannot.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very compelling and exciting work,'' said Dr. David A.
Cheresh of the Scripps Research Institute in San Diego, Calif. ``It
gives you a gold mine of potential targets.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. George Yancopoulos, chief scientific officer at Regeneron
Pharmaceuticals, described the new work as a ``fabulous story''
because it explained a range of previous observations about
angiogenesis, including the fact that blood vessels that sprout new
branches seem in some respects to be reverting to an embryonic
state.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the new work springs from a study of genes that control
the development of the embryo and in particular a process by which
the versatile, all-purpose cells of the embryo take up their mature
and final form.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, Dr. Robert Benezra discovered a family of genes that
postponed the maturation of muscle cells, a process known to
biologists as differentiation. He called the genes ID genes, for
inhibitors of differentiation.
</P>
<P>
   With David Lyden, Alison Z. Young and colleagues at Memorial
Sloan-Kettering and elsewhere, Benezra then created strains of mice
that lacked the genes. Creating these ``knock-out'' mice is a
laborious though standard way of trying to learn what role a new
gene plays by seeing what deficiencies a mouse develops.
</P>
<P>
   To Benezra's surprise he found that although the proteins
produced by the ID genes are important in the embryo, they also
have a role in adult life, that of orchestrating the changes
involved in creating new blood vessels.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to figure out how these proteins worked,'' Benezra
said. ``I had no idea we would be thrown into the angiogenesis
world.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sloan-Kettering team found that mice lacking all copies of
the ID genes died in the womb, but if just three of the four copies
were knocked out, the mice were born healthy and apparently normal.
The deficiency of ID genes showed up only when the animals were
injected with malignant cells.
</P>
<P>
   When either lymphoma or breast cancer cells were injected, the
mice formed transient tumors that failed to establish a blood
supply and quickly regressed. The mice did not develop cancer and
lived a normal life span. After an injection of lung cancer cells,
tumors did develop but did not spread to other sites in their
usually aggressive way. The mice died, but not until much later
than normal mice treated the same way.
</P>
<P>
   The mice's resistance to cancer, Benezra and his colleagues
believe, arises because their lack of ID genes makes them incapable
of building the new blood vessels that tumors must have to survive.
</P>
<P>
   To grow beyond a certain size, tumors must induce a nearby blood
vessel to sprout new branches that will supply them with oxygen and
nutrients. Presumably, the tumors send out some signal that forces
the blood-vessel cells to switch on their ID genes. In mice that
lack the ID gene, the cells are deaf to the tumors' deadly siren
call.
</P>
<P>
   Benezra said that he had already identified a chemical that
inactivates the protein produced by the ID genes, and is working
with Angiogenex, a biotechnology company in Seattle, to evaluate
it.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Because the ID genes seem to play no role in human adults except
when new blood vessels are being formed, therapy that inhibits the
gene should have no serious side effects.
</P>
<P>
   The broader significance of the Sloan-Kettering work is that the
ID genes seem to lie at the top of the cascade of genes that direct
growth of new blood vessels. Each of these genes could offer a
point at which to disrupt the angiogenesis induced by tumors.
Exploration of the role of these subsidiary genes may also lead to
better understanding of the substances now being tested as
anti-angiogenic agents.
</P>
<P>
   Cheresh, for example, has found that angiogenesis is inhibited
by substances that attack a protein called integrin, which studs
the surface of new blood-vessel cells and helps them bore into the
tissues they are irrigating.
</P>
<P>
   Benezra found some evidence that the integrin gene is switched
off in cells that lack their ID genes. He also hopes to determine
whether angiostatin and endostatin, two angiogenesis antagonists
developed by Dr. Judah Folkman of the Harvard Medical School, work
through the ID gene pathway.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate on Wednesday rejected a treaty banning
all underground nuclear testing in a 51-48 vote that crushed one of
the major arms initiatives of the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   The vote on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, largely along
party lines, followed a weeklong power play among Senate
Republicans, Democrats and the White House to forestall the defeat
of the treaty by delaying action until after President Clinton
leaves office.
</P>
<P>
   In a last-ditch effort to save the treaty, Clinton called the
Republican leader, Trent Lott, two hours before the vote and asked
that he delay action for national security reasons. In a blunt
rebuff, Lott told the president that what he offered was too
little, too late, and he pushed ahead with an action he knew would
humiliate Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The vote marked the first time that the Senate defeated a major
international security pact since the Treaty of Versailles,
creating the League of Nations, failed to win Senate approval in
1920. While the Senate and White House often joust on legislation
governing domestic issues, in matters of national security senators
of both parties have usually deferred to the president.
</P>
<P>
   The failure of the treaty to clear the Senate raised serious
questions about its survival. Supporters of the treaty, in
Washington and abroad, had argued that if it was not adopted by the
United States, other nuclear nations, ranging from Pakistan and
India to Russia and China, would follow suit, denying the 1996
treaty the 44 ratifications it needs to go into force. The leaders
of Britain, France and Germany had urged the Senate to postpone the
vote.

PATAKI WILL ORDER POWER PLANTS TO CUT EMISSIONS

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Gov. George Pataki will order power plants in the
state to make sharp cuts in the smokestack emissions that cause
acid rain and smog, his aides said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The move will raise the state's electricity rates by 1 percent
to 2 percent, they said, but it will put New York substantially
ahead of the rest of the country in the cleanup schedule set by the
federal Clean Air Act.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki, who is expected to outline the plan at a news conference
Thursday, will order cuts in two kinds of pollution: sulfur
dioxide, the main cause of acid rain, and nitrogen oxides, which
cause smog and also contribute to acid rain, administration
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   While an impending federal rule would require cuts in nitrogen
oxides only in the summer, when smog is at its worst, the new New
York state regulations would require the same reductions all year,
the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Word of Pataki's plans pleased both environmental groups seeking
cleaner air and power companies with proposals to build new
natural-gas power plants in the state. These plants are costly to
build but produce much less pollution than the old coal-burning
plants that dominate in western New York. Under the new rules, the
gas-fired plants will be able to compete against coal plants,
energy experts say, because the coal plants will have to invest in
expensive systems to filter pollution.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very exciting and bold move by the governor,'' said
Ned Sullivan, the executive director of Scenic Hudson, a private
environmental group. ``No other state has mandated this level of
reduction for acid rain control.''
</P>
<P>
   The slight increase in electric rates would be more than offset
by the environmental benefits, said John Cahill, the state
commissioner of environmental conservation. ``No one could dispute
now that New York has done more than any other state in the country
to control emissions from its sources,'' Cahill said Wednesday,
after describing the plan. In addition, he said, the New York plan
could add momentum to efforts in Congress to pass federal
legislation that would require similar reductions.
</P>
<P>
   Owners of some of the state's coal-fired plants, which sit
mainly in western New York and the upper Hudson Valley, said they
could not comment on specifics until after the Pataki
administration released details Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But some said they planned to comply with whatever new standards
emerged once the new regulations were written. ``Our goal is always
to meet or exceed environmental standards,'' said Frank Rapley, a
spokesman for NRG Energy Inc., a Minneapolis company that recently
bought two of the biggest power plants in the state, Dunkirk and
C.R. Huntley, near Buffalo.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Starting next year, a provision of the Clean Air Act will
require a 35 percent reduction in nitrogen oxide emissions from
power plants, but only from May through September. The state would
require the same reduction throughout the year. As a result, annual
emissions would drop from levels like those seen in 1998 _ 102,000
tons _ to 62,000 tons a year, according to state environmental
officials. That level is 20,000 tons less than the federal rule
would allow, they said.
</P>
<P>
   The planned reductions in sulfur dioxide emissions would be even
sharper, dropping from more than 300,000 tons a year _ the level in
1998 _ to less than 130,000 tons a year, with the reduction being
phased in from 2003 to 2007, Cahill said. Under the Clean Air Act,
New York would only be required to cut its sulfur dioxide pollution
to 262,000 tons a year, according to state officials.
</P>
<P>
   A spate of recent studies has shown that pollution cuts called
for under the Clean Air Act will not be sufficient to repair damage
to forests, streams and lakes around the Northeast from acidic rain
and snow.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, New York environmental officials calculate, only 17 to
20 percent of the acid rain problem in the Adirondacks and other
areas upstate comes from pollution produced by New York's own power
plants. The rest comes from coal-fired power plants in the Middle
West and South, Cahill said.
</P>
<P>
   New York has been locked in a dispute for a decade with those
states.
</P>
<P>
   By moving to cut its own pollution, Cahill said, the state can
increase the pressure on them to follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the federal Environmental Protection Agency said
that some of Pataki's planned cuts in power-plant pollution would
have been required anyway. Some states downwind of New York have
petitioned the EPA to force some of New York's old coal-fired
plants to cut pollution that drifts east and contributes to
problems.
</P>
<P>
   But they conceded that some of New York's moves, particularly
the cut in nitrogen oxides throughout the year, went beyond
anything done by any other states.
</P>
<P>
   Many private environmental groups were delighted by the Pataki
plan. ``It sets a new tone, and increases New York's commitment to
putting more pressure on Washington to make it all happen,'' said
Ashok Gupta, an economist at the Natural Resources Defense Council.
But, he said that if Congress did not quickly follow suit with
stronger federal laws, it might still be possible in several years
for New York to retreat.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate development, state Attorney General L. Spitzer,
who is investigating eight of New York's older power plants for
possible violations of federal and state pollution rules, sent
letters Tuesday to their owners requesting hundreds of pages of
documents.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer announced in September that he planned to sue the owners
of power plants in upwind states, on the ground that their
pollution harmed New Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
   According to Larry Shapiro, a lawyer for the New York Public
Interest Research Group, a lobbying and environmental organization,
the moves by Pataki and Spitzer show that New York is finally
getting serious about stanching the flow of air pollution, whether
its source is smokestacks in upwind states or in New York itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have to lead by example,'' Shapiro said, ``and
that's what the governor's doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Many air pollution experts said that the maneuvers implied a
significant amount of political competition for credit as New York
moved toward cutting pollution, with the Republican governor and
Democratic attorney general eager to be perceived as a leader on
the issue.
</P>
<P>
   But Darren Dopp, a spokesman for Spitzer, said the end result
was a good one. ``The bottom line is that a little competition
between us and them is good for the air,'' he said Wednesday.

EXPECTED COST SAVINGS, PROFITS ELUDE RAYTHEON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A round of consolidation in the defense industry in recent years
was supposed to produce big cost savings and profits for the
survivors.
</P>
<P>
   But things haven't worked out that way for Raytheon Co., the
nation's third-largest defense contractor, whose class B shares
tumbled 44 percent on Tuesday to close at 24 1/4 after it outlined
big revenue and earnings shortfalls; shares lost another 1 5/8 in
trading Wednesday to close at 22 5/8.
</P>
<P>
   The disclosures included a confession by Raytheon chief
executive Daniel Burnham that the company had blown its attempts to
integrate operations it purchased in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``In retrospect, we tried to do too much too fast,'' he told
analysts and reporters in a marathon three-hour teleconference,
reviewing a plethora of cases where profits had fallen below
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Burnham vowed to do better, but the news left analysts
struggling to comprehend the outlook for the company, based in
Lexington, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   The disappointing earnings news also served as a reminder that
despite modest growth in defense spending, contractors such as
Raytheon and its troubled rival, Lockheed Martin Corp., must find
ways to build sales, particularly in often-lucrative overseas
markets.
</P>
<P>
   The lower costs Raytheon had hoped to obtain from its
acquisitions _ the declared rationale for many mergers _ ``clearly
appear to have been over-estimated,'' said Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP;
Jenrette analyst Joe Nadol. He downgraded Raytheon's stock from
``buy'' to ``market perform'' despite its lower price.
</P>
<P>
   Nadol said he worries whether Raytheon can achieve the
additional foreign sales it needs to drive earnings growth. ``I'm
not convinced we have a full grip on what the ongoing profitability
in their defense business is,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Defense industry consolidation moved into high gear in 1995 with
the merger of Lockheed Corp. and Martin Marietta Corp. Over the
next two years Boeing Corp. purchased Rockwell International and
McDonnell Douglas. The Pentagon blessed all these deals, mindful of
a procurement budget that had fallen to $43.1 billion in 1995 from
its 1985 peak of $90 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon didn't join the merger-and-acquisitions game until
1997, however, and when it did, it set the ambitious goals of
integrating simultaneously two giant defense units purchased from
Texas Instruments Inc. and Hughes Electronics Corp. for a total of
$12.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Those purchases doubled Raytheon's annual revenue to about $20
billion and brought it control of many new products such as the
Hughes' Tomahawk cruise missile.
</P>
<P>
   Most analysts expected that Raytheon's reputation for good
management meant the company would assimiliate the new units
straightaway, said Jon Kutler, president of Quarterdeck Investment
Partners, a Los Angeles-based investment bank that has worked for
Raytheon on other deals.
</P>
<P>
   But the company now admits it had difficulty keeping track of
finances made more complex by the acquisitions that added dozens of
new facilities and thousands more employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``By trying to do it all at once they basically upped the bar,''
Kutler said in a telephone interview Wednesday. ``Raytheon had the
reputation of being great managers, and people thought they could
pull it off. In hindsight, maybe there was a happy medium in terms
of the speed they could have attempted.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Raytheon must prove it can boost overseas sales of products
like its Patriot ground-to-air missile, which command higher profit
margins than do sales to the Pentagon. Overseas revenue accounted
for 26 percent of Raytheon's business last year, down from 29
percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Along with its gloomy earnings forecast, Raytheon on Tuesday
said it would cut 2,380 jobs, including 340 positions in
Massachusetts and New Hampshire, for which it would take a charge
of about $92 million this year. The figures include 140 workers who
will lose their jobs at Raytheon's Lexington headquarters, but the
company hasn't specified which other facilities will be affected.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Raytheon spokesman David Polk said the company is
continuing to hire software engineers and other white-collar
employees, and that total Massachusetts employment at the end of
the year will be about 13,700, or the same as last summer.
Worldwide, Raytheon now has 108,000 employees, although the company
was unable to say how many workers it will have after the current
round of layoffs is complete.
</P>
<P>
   One group of workers whose jobs appear safe are the 1,000
workers at a Portsmouth, R.I., facility where Raytheon builds naval
electronics systems.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of positions already have been shed at Portsmouth in
recent years, but a spokesman for US Representative Patrick
Kennedy, a Democrat whose congressional district includes
Portsmouth, said Wednesday Raytheon executives told them recently
no further cuts are planned there.

COLUMBIA PROFESSOR WINS NOBEL PRIZE IN ECONOMICS 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By DIANA B. HENRIQUES    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Robert A. Mundell of Columbia University, an eccentric
Canadian-born economist who helped frame the supply-side economic
theories that strongly influenced the Reagan administration, was
awarded the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Mundell, 66, was recognized by the Royal Swedish Academy of
Sciences not for his influence on what came to be called
Reaganomics, but for his contributions to international economics,
as the first theorist to demonstrate how the international flow of
capital could affect an individual country's ability to manage its
own economy through interest-rate changes and tax and budget
policies.
</P>
<P>
   His discovery may seem commonplace today, when tidal waves of
money surge around the globe at the click of a computer mouse as
professional currency speculators like George Soros cruise from
dollars to lira to yen and back again.
</P>
<P>
   But in the early 1960s, when Mundell was developing his
prize-winning theories, most nations except for Canada and the
United States heavily regulated the flow of capital across their
borders and government officials typically tinkered with their own
economies without much attention to global currency movements.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was way ahead of his time in recognizing that capital
mobility had profound effects on the functioning of a country's
economy,'' said Peter Kenen, an economist at Princeton University.
</P>
<P>
   Mundell was in London for a conference on Wednesday when he
learned he had won the prize and the $1 million cash award that
accompanies it. He did not return calls left at his hotel, but many
economists said Wednesday that he had long been considered a
leading contender for the profession's top honor.
</P>
<P>
   Although a longtime resident of the United States, Mundell grew
up in a small town in Ontario and earned his undergraduate degree
in economics at the University of British Columbia. Those Canadian
roots were critical to the development of his ideas, several
colleagues said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Canada, he had his laboratory,'' said Rudi Dornbusch, a
professor of international economics at the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology who once studied under Mundell.
</P>
<P>
   His experiments focused on the two tools that governments use to
affect their economic health: Monetary policy, which involves
changes in interest rates and the money supply, and fiscal policy,
the sum of a government's budget and tax decisions.
</P>
<P>
   As a young doctoral student, Mundell observed that Canada's use
of monetary policy sometimes worked and sometimes didn't, depending
on what kind of currency exchange-rate policies were in place at
the time.
</P>
<P>
   His conclusion, according to the citation released Wednesday by
the academy in Stockholm, was that ``under a floating exchange
rate, monetary policy becomes powerful and fiscal policy powerless,
whereas the opposite is true when the exchange rate is fixed.''
</P>
<P>
   Mundell's work ``was very precocious at the time,'' said Jadish
Bhagwhati, a colleague at Columbia. ``In those days, you could
actually teach about closed economic models _ today it would be
ludicrous to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   A rumpled, broad-faced man who once wore his unruly white hair
down to his shoulders, Mundell was an early advocate of substantial
tax cuts as a stimulus to economic growth. When his views attracted
the attention of political conservatives in the late 1970s, he
found himself on the front lines of Washington policy battles
between those who feared the economic impact of huge deficits and
those who believed that tax cuts were just the tonic the economy
needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``His work really began to give intellectual firepower to the
supply-side tax cuts movement,'' said former Rep. Jack Kemp on
Wednesday. ``By 1980, then-candidate Ronald Reagan had become
persuaded about what Robert Mundell was saying _ and the rest is
history.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Jude Winniski, a former editorial writer for The Wall Street
Journal who helped promote Mundell's views, was elated at the news
from Stockholm. On his Web site Wednesday, he predicted that the
honor will give Mundell ``the standing to consolidate the
supply-side revolution he began.''
</P>
<P>
   Mundell has also contributed substantially to the emergence of a
common y for Europe, said Kenneth Rogoff, a professor of
economics at Harvard. ``He started people on the road to realizing
that it is very, very hard to go to a fixed exchange rate without a
common currency,'' Rogoff said.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, Mundell has generated controversy by encouraging
a return to a system of fixed exchange rates, similar to the
arrangement established after World War II that called for the
value of world currencies to be tied to the U.S. dollar, which in
turn could be redeemed for gold. That system died in 1971, after
huge trade deficits had put piles of dollars into the hands of the
nation's trading partners, which threatened to redeem them for
gold.
</P>
<P>
   One recent paper, published by the Center for Economic Policy
Studies at St. Vincent College in Latrobe, Pa., is entitled, ``The
International Monetary System in the 21st Century: Could Gold Make
a Comeback?''
</P>
<P>
   But if exchange rates and monetary policy conjure up an image of
a tedious ideologue, nothing could be further from reality, the
professor's colleagues and friends said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is decidedly not a nerd,'' laughed Dornbusch.
</P>
<P>
   Mundell earned his doctorate in economics in 1956 from MIT,
after spending a year at the London School of Economics. His
various faculty posts included at stint at the University of
Chicago, where from 1966 through 1970, he was an editor of the
prestigious Journal of Political Economy. The university's famous
economics department ``was sort of like a mining town in those
days, with lots of hard drinking and long poker games,'' one friend
recalled.
</P>
<P>
   He joined Columbia's faculty in 1974, establishing himself in a
rambling book-filled apartment in Morningside Heights. An avid
painter, he produced roughly 400 richly colored canvases in a
single 18-month period, said Winniski, who compared the professor's
bold abstract artistic style with ``Van Gogh gone wild.''
</P>
<P>
   Colleagues and proteges have come to covet invitations to his
second home, ``Santa Colomba,'' an ancient Tuscan villa in
Monteriggioni, near Siena, which he purchased from the Catholic
Church about 30 years ago and has been slowly restoring to its
Renaissance glory.
</P>
<P>
   And a visit to the professor's home page at Columbia's Web site
reveals his latest fascination: his baby son Nicholas, his
photogenic offspring from a second marriage. He has three grown
children from an earlier marriage that ended in divorce in 1972.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Three times now, President Boris Yeltsin has tried to
get rid of a troublesome prosecutor general whose investigations
into corruption have crept inside the Kremlin itself.
</P>
<P>
   And Wednesday, Yeltsin failed for the third time. Russia's
increasingly rebellious Federation Council, the upper house of
parliament, rebuffed yet another attempt to fire Yuri Skuratov, who
sealed his political fate in Russia one year ago by signing a
secret order initiating a criminal investigation into links between
top Kremlin officials and a Swiss construction company, Mabetex
Project Engineering.
</P>
<P>
   That investigation, given new life recently by a stream of leaks
in both Russia and Switzerland, has offered evidence suggesting,
among other things, that Mabetex, which did considerable work in
Russia, bankrolled shopping sprees by Yeltsin's two daughters.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, after eight months of limbo since the first attempt
to oust him, and with eight months to go before Russia is scheduled
to elect a president, Skuratov again put his case to the Federation
Council.
</P>
<P>
   ``The masks have been cast off and the situation has become as
simple as it can be,'' he said. ``Either we all try to stem the
tide of corruption and salvage whatever authority our country still
has in the world community _ and I am prepared to work with your
support _ or the Federation Council will follow the path indicated
for it by the corrupt Kremlin officials.''
</P>
<P>
   By a vote of 98-52, the council _ made up of regional leaders
now at the focus of Russia's intense and vicious power struggle _
again took Skuratov's side.
</P>
<P>
   Skuratov's next battle to win back his old job will be in
Russia's Constitutional Court, which is scheduled this week to
examine Yeltsin's order to suspend him pending a criminal
investigation hurriedly prepared against him last April. The heart
of that case is a video, broadcast March 18 on a state-owned
television channel, that showed Skuratov in bed with two
prostitutes allegedly provided by businessmen under investigation
by the prosecutor's office.
</P>
<P>
   Turned out of his office, Skuratov has continued to occupy an
ample government dacha on the outskirts of Moscow provided,
paradoxically, by the Kremlin property administration headed by
Yeltsin's friend Pavel Borodin, who is the principal target of the
Mabetex inquiry.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   His armored Mercedes has been replaced by a Russian-made Volga
sedan, and his salary has shriveled to about $60 a month.
</P>
<P>
   In the last month, his dacha, his Moscow apartment and even his
mother-in-law's apartment have been searched by government
investigators. He said they had confiscated videos of family
birthday parties, as well as 13 of 14 suits made by a
Kremlin-favored tailor, which his enemies say were actually a gift
from Mabetex.
</P>
<P>
   But Skuratov has refused to stay silent. And his periodic salvos
against the Yeltsin administration, delivered to a steady stream of
visiting journalists, have become part of the background noise for
the political battle to control who succeeds the president, and
what Yeltsin's legacy will be.
</P>
<P>
   In all this, Skuratov remains a curious figure. Not everyone
accepts his portrayal of himself as a lonely crusader against
corruption. Some point to his friendly relations with some of the
most hard-line members of the Communist opposition. Others say he
is no better than the people he investigates.
</P>
<P>
   Again and again, however, Skuratov comes back to the tale of the
Mabetex investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Attempts are being made to destroy the Mabetex case, to show
that it is all politics,'' Skuratov said recently in a lengthy
interview in his dacha dining room. ``But I won't allow it to
happen because I paid for it with my own career. I simply won't
allow the case to be destroyed. It is a method of self-defense.''
</P>
<P>
   The secret order initiating the Mabetex case was the key that
unleashed a Swiss-Russian investigation that is still in progress.
Documents seized in a search of the Mabetex offices in Lugano,
Switzerland, and brought to Moscow last spring contained evidence
that Mabetex had provided credit cards to Yeltsin and his two
daughters, Tatyana Dyachenko and Yelena Okulova, Skuratov said. The
documents also indicated that Mabetex paid for purchases made on
those cards, which amounted to tens of thousands of dollars, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone conversation in September with President Clinton,
Yeltsin denied the allegations against him and his daughters.
</P>
<P>
   Skuratov is fighting his suspensions in the courts, but
acknowledges that he is unlikely to get his job back _ at least not
until there is a change in Russia's leadership. And he plays a
prominent part in the power tussles preceding the elections for
Parliament in December and for president next summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The closer we get to a change in power, now less than a year
away, the more those who know things feel on firmer ground,'' said
Pavel Voshchanov, a former press secretary to Yeltsin. ``And
corruption in Russia is a tree that has its roots at the top.''
</P>
<P>
   Skuratov denies that his pursuit of the Mabetex investigation is
politically motivated. But he makes no secret of his admiration for
Yevgeny Primakov, the former prime minister who was also fired by
Yelt-sin for failing to pass the Kremlin's increasingly pointed
loyalty tests, and who is now a leading candidate to become the
next president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pin great hopes on Primakov,'' Skuratov said. He said
Primakov allowed him to investigate Russia's oligarchs and the
Yeltsin family.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Skuratov, 47, the son of a police officer, began his career as a
law professor in Sverdlovsk, now renamed Yekaterinburg, which is
also Yeltsin's hometown. He wathusiastic supporter of
Yelt-sin, first as the local Communist Party boss and later as the
leader of the democratic reform movement.
</P>
<P>
   Skuratov came to Moscow in 1989 to join the staff of the law
department of the Communist Party's Central Committee. By 1991 he
was a member of the Yeltsin team, as adviser to the Se
Ministry _ the old KGB _ and later as one of the drafters of the
1993 Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   When he was named chief prosecutor in October 1995, the
opposition welcomed him as someone who was politically unengaged.
</P>
<P>
   His first break with the Yeltsin team, he said, came in the 1996
elections when he opened an investigation into two top Yeltsin
campaign aides who were caught leaving the Kremlin with a box
containing $550,000 in cash. Skuratov said he soon learned that
Kremlin denials of the event were false, and top Kremlin aides
pressed him to drop the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since then the president has held me in distrust,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the weeks before his suspension, Skuratov said, he tried to
reach Yeltsin to inform him that evidence of his daughters'
shopping sprees had turned up in the Swiss investigation. When he
failed to get a meeting with the President, Skuratov said, he
reported it to Primakov, who told him it was his duty to carry on
the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   But he said that when Yeltsin called him last March to tell him
he was being ousted, Primakov, who was present along with Vladimir
Putin, now prime minister, did not object.
</P>
<P>
   He said the original investigation into Mabetex was begun by the
German and Italian tax police, who were investigating the ``huge
turnover'' in Mabetex-related bank accounts. Carla del Ponte, then
the Swiss federal prosecutor, asked Skuratov whether he was
interested in pursuing it at his end.
</P>
<P>
   ``How could I say I was not interested in that?'' he asked.
``She would say that Skuratov is not interested in corruption in
the top echelons of power in Russia, that he is a prosecutor who is
afraid of everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``I also understood one more thing,'' he said. ``Sooner or
later, these materials would come out.''
</P>
<P>
   Since his suspension, the tempo of the Mabetex investigation in
Russia has slowed. But Skuratov, helped by television stations and
newspapers whose owners have also broken with the Kremlin, has kept
up the pressure.
</P>
<P>
   This month he gave an interview to NTV, a private television
channel, in which he said for the first time that Mabetex had paid
$10 million to $15 million in bribes to Russian officials, a figure
he said came from the Swiss prosecutors. He also called on
Yeltsin's daughters to make a public accounting of the reported
credit card charges.
</P>
<P>
   Within days officials raided Skuratov's dacha and his apartment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course the family is afraid,'' he said. ``Now they control
the situation, but it may get out of hand.''

WILT CHAMBERLAIN: GIANT CONTRADICTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ To the generation of basketball fans who have grown up
since Wilt Chamberlain retired: You have no idea.
</P>
<P>
   Not just about the the enormity of the man, who was then dwarfed
by his staggering accomplishments. But about the contradictions.
</P>
<P>
   The only player to lead the NBA in scoring, rebounds and assists
could not execute consistently a basketball action often mastered
by 12-year-olds: The free throw.
</P>
<P>
   When the nation in 1968 was shaken by a civil rights movement
seeking long-denied justice, Chamberlain,who along with Muhammad
Ali may have been the world's most prominent black athletes,
endorsed Richard Nixon for president.
</P>
<P>
   The man who once averaged 48.5 minutes in a season for a
48-minute game (he played overtimes too) was sometimes criticized
for lacking competitive heart.
</P>
<P>
   For a player who remade basketball for all future big men, who
forced the rules writers to rejigger the game, who was the
7-foot-1, 275-pound acme of basketball's majestic power, his most
frequent contact with the game in his retirement was as a spectator
at Los Angeles Clippers' contests, where he was a pal of the club's
vile owner, Donald Sterling.
</P>
<P>
   For all his imagery as an invincible titan, he was probably too
soft, fearful of his power to injure. Said longtime rival and
friend Bill Russell of Chamberlain's famous 1970 Finals showdown
with gimpy-legged Willis Reed, who led the Knicks to victory over
the Lakers partly because Chamberlain seemed to back off:
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm the one playing Willis when he comes out limping, it
would only have emphasized my goal to beat them that much worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the behemoth Lothario who claimed to have bedded 20,000
women died Tuesday at home in bed, alone, never married.
</P>
<P>
   A man bigger than nearly all men and nearly all description,
Chamberlain's contradictions make him that much richer a character,
and so much more than a great ballplayer.
</P>
<P>
   Yet his ballplaying greatness has somehow been warped, not only
with time but through the green filter of Russell, his nemesis,
rival and friend whose unmatched career seemed fated to compromise
the game's most powerful, agile giant.
</P>
<P>
   As the pair locked up in a goateed grind in the low post
throughout the 1960s, it was Russell's Celtics who almost always
were superior to Chamberlain's Warriors, 76ers and Lakers teams.
Watching the NBA evolve on fuzzy black-and-white TVs, it seemed
that every winter Sunday was incomplete without at least a few
minutes spent watching Russell barely outmaneuver his formidable
adversary.
</P>
<P>
   Sports theater was rarely better. To witness two such skilled,
intelligent, dramatic rivals directly pitted against each other for
most of a decade was a national privilege, made all the more rare
by sports' failure to produce its like again.
</P>
<P>
   Russell's teams won 11 championships in 13 years, and he was
recently selected Sports Illustrated's greatest team player of all
time. Chamberlain's Philadelphia team of 1966-67 and his Laker team
of 1971-72 won titles, but it was never enough, even though those
teams may have been the best in league history.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all judged by the championships we win,'' said forlorn
Laker president Jerry West Tuesday, talking about his former
teammate and fellow 40-year hoop icon. ``Unfortunately, he only won
two.''
</P>
<P>
   Only won two.
</P>
<P>
   Think about that. Consider how many NBA greats, particularly in
the Michael Jordan era, never won a single one. But Chamberlain
seems forever consigned to secondary status because his foil had so
many more.
</P>
<P>
   The heat of their battle long since faded to cold embers,
Russell articulated, during the NBA All-Star game in 1997 that
featured the selection of its 50 greatest players, the truth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody seems to appreciate what an incredible player Wilt
was,'' he said. ``He was the best player of all time because he
dominated the floor like nobody else ever could. To be that big and
athletic was special.''
</P>
<P>
   That may be blasphemous in the recently concluded era of Jordan.
Comparisons between eras are always murky, as well as comparisons
between different positions. But there is one fact that usually
escapes consideration in the argument.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA of Chamberlain's time had about 100 players. The NBA
when Jordan dominated swelled to more than 300, meaning he came up
against nowhere near the caliber of competition Chamberlain took on
every night. Whether it was Russell or Reed, or Nate Thurmond, Walt
Bellamy or Wes Unseld, Chamberlain almost always ran into a quality
foe.
</P>
<P>
   He crushed 'em all.
</P>
<P>
   Forget the freakish, 100-point game. Those 50-point, 28-rebound
games that he (begin italic) averaged (end italic) didn't come
against Jim McIlvaine or Greg Ostertag. While 30 years of gene-pool
splashings may have improved the caliber of the average NBA
athlete, 30 years of expansion have spread those athletes around
much more broadly.
</P>
<P>
   Chamberlain in his prime today would be even more dominant than
in his day, because of the flatness of the surrounding territory.
And owing to growth of the NBA's popularity and the increase in
media coverage, his blunt, sometimes reckless personality would be
even more immense.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine a Dennis Rodman with brains, sophistication and
multidimensional talent.
</P>
<P>
   In his 1983 biography ``Giant Steps,'' Kareem Abdul-Jabbar wrote
about his hero worship as a kid of Chamberlain, his brief playing
rivalry as their careers crossed in the early 1970s, and of his
later contempt for his personal politics.
</P>
<P>
   But the game's giants eventually patched things up. And although
the book is filled with Abdul-Jabbar's belief of his superiority
over Chamberlain, he knew that in psychological as well as physical
stature, there was no one in the public mind quite like
Chamberlain.
</P>
<P>
   Abdul-Jabbar wrote: ``In airplanes and subways, on movie lines
or in the street, all big black guys were asked not, `Are you Bill
Russell?' but `Are you Wilt?' ''
</P>
<P>
   In his greatness, his contradictions and his foibles,
Chamberlain was a magnificent American original _ outsized, all
ways.

BLACKS LESS LIKELY TO HAVE LUNG CANCER SURGERY, SAYS STUDY

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Black patients with early-stage lung cancer are less
likely than whites to undergo life-saving surgery, and as a result
are more likely to die of their disease, doctors are reporting
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Peter B. Bach, a lung specialist at Memorial Sloan-Kettering
Cancer Center in Manhattan and an author of the report, said the
for the disparity was unknown. But Bach said it was not
because of the differences between the races in socioeconomic
status, insurance, general health or access to medical care.
</P>
<P>
   Among the possible causes, the researchers said, are that
doctors do not recommend surgery to blacks as often as to whites,
or that blacks more often refuse surgery, perhaps because of poor
doctor-patient communication.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a bad situation where patients with potentially curable
disease are not having surgical treatment and therefore are
dying,'' Bach said. He and his co-authors said it was imperative
that doctors acted to make sure that black patients got the lung
surgery they needed. ``It's extremely important that we figure out
what's happening,'' Bach said. ``We're talking about saving a lot
of lives.''
</P>
<P>
   The study by Bach and three other researchers is being published
Thursday in the New England Journal of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Hugh Stallworth, a national vice president of the American
Cancer Society, said, ``This study suggests that, possibly,
physicians are treating cancer patients not just based upon their
illness and recommended treatment, but on the basis of their
race.'' Stallworth said other studies had also suggested that the
providers of health care treated patients differently on the basis
of race or ethnic group.
</P>
<P>
   ``So this is not new,'' Stallworth said. ``But each time we hear
it, it's surprising and rather shocking, specifically as it relates
to cancer. It's quite concerning.''
</P>
<P>
   He and Bach said that the findings come at a critical period in
lung cancer research in the United States. A study published in
July suggested that a test called spiral C.T., or computed
tomography, could detect lung cancers at an earlier stage than
standard methods, and increase the rate of cure for the disease. If
that test fulfills its promise, and nothing is done to eliminate
the racial disparity, the gap in the lung cancer death rate might
even increase.
</P>
<P>
   Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in the United
States, killing more than 150,000 people a year. The people in
Bach's study all had the most common form of the disease,
non-small-cell lung cancer. The study was based on the medical
records of 10,984 patients (860 black and 10,124 white) 65 years
old and over who were found to have an early stage of the disease
from 1985 to 1993. Surgery is the treatment of choice for such
patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without surgery, half the patients are dead in a year,'' Bach
said. ``With surgery, it takes more than four years for half to
die.''
</P>
<P>
   Among whites, 76.7 percent had surgery. But only 64 percent of
the blacks did.
</P>
<P>
   ``For every five whites that had surgery, only four blacks
did,'' Bach said.
</P>
<P>
   Survival differed as well: five years after the diagnosis, 34.1
percent of whites, but only 26.4 percent of blacks, were still
alive. But when patients who had surgery were compared, five-year
survival rates were similar: 42.9 percent for whites, 39.1 percent
for blacks; the difference was not meaningful statistically, and
may have been due in part to the fact the overall longevity is
lower for blacks than for whites.
</P>
<P>
   The authors studied people 65 and over because medical
information on them was available through the Medicare program.
They cautioned that it is not known if the findings applied to
younger patients.
</P>
<P>
   The records did not disclose why some patients did not have
surgery. But Bach said they provided enough information to prove
that the unequal surgery rates could not be blamed on differences
between the races in socioeconomic status, insurance, sex,
complicating illnesses or access to care. Rather, the disparity
appeared to depend entirely on race itself, the researchers said.
</P>
<P>
   But the researchers could not say if doctors were less likely to
recommend surgery to black patients, or if black patients
themselves were more likely to refuse surgery.
</P>
<P>
   But Stallworth said, ``I can't believe that number of people
would not avail themselves of the recommended treatment, if the
information is presented in the right way, in a sensitive and
knowledgeable way.''
</P>
<P>
   But there may be communication gaps, he said. If doctor and
patient cannot establish a rapport, the patient may be reluctant to
take the doctor's advice, and the doctor may give up, feeling he or
she has made a good-faith effort to help.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that patients, black and white, feel more comfortable
with physicians that are like them, look like them and sound like
them,'' Stallworth said. ``And physicians relate better to patients
who are more like them.''
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, 12 percent of the population is black, but
only 4 percent of doctors are.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``What has been suggested is that we may need to look at our
medical training programs and begin to introduce some type of
cultural sensitivity,'' Stallworth said. ``Some would even go
further and say we need to introduce some human sensitivity. This
transcends culture. It's one human being talking to another human
being.''
</P>
<P>
   It has also been suggested that more minority doctors are
needed, but Stallworth said that while he agreed, that was no way
to solve cultural misunderstandings. If doctor and patient cannot
communicate, regardless of racial background, ``you have a serious,
serious problem,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In an editorial accompanying the study, Dr. Talmadge E. King
Jr., chief of Medical Services at San Francisco General Hospital,
said racial differences could be a barrier to effective
communication. ``I think there's a very, very complex interaction
we need to understand better so that we can partner with patients
who may not feel comfortable interacting with us,'' King said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   King said that at his hospital, more than half the patients were
black or Hispanic, and 20 percent were Chinese. Each group, he
said, has slightly different attitudes about medical care.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a huge issue we deal with,'' King said. ``We are
acutely aware of it, and trying to do better.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   King, who is black, said that some black patients tended to be a
bit more fatalistic and religious than whites, and to believe that
God would take care of them.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Because of those beliefs, he said, it can be harder to convince
them that treatment is necessary.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   ``If a patient is talking to a majority physician who is not
familiar with the background and and doesn't think through how to
approach this patient, there can be delays in care,'' King said.
``And the patient moves from being an operable candidate to
becoming inoperable during this period of miscommunication. This is
a ticking time bomb.''

MOTOROLA PLANS TO TAKE A BIG CHARGE FOR IRIDIUM 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By DAVID BARBOZA    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Motorola Inc. said Wednesday that it expected to take
a $500 million charge against earnings in the fourth quarter, a
move that would essentially write off its entire exposure to
Iridium, the struggling global satellite telephone service.
</P>
<P>
   The charge would bring Motorola's entire write-off to more than
$2.3 billion _ eclipsing even the huge corporate misstep that
Quaker Oats Co. made a few years ago with its acquisition of
Snapple, the beverage maker ultimately cost Quaker $1.4
billion.
</P>
<P>
   For Motorola, the hope is that the large reserves it has built
up to cover its exposure to Iridium will not be entirely depleted,
and that Iridium, which is trying to reorganize under Chapter 11
bankruptcy-law protection, will emerge with new prospects for
growth. The announcement may also alleviate some pressure on
Motorola by outlining its full exposure to the troubled satellite
project.
</P>
<P>
   The Motorola announcement came a day after the giant
telecommunication and semiconductor maker announced a $994 million
pretax charge against third-quarter earnings because of its
investment in Iridium. The news was released after the close of
stock trading Tuesday, and the company's stock fell $4.5625 a share
Wednesday, to $90.375, on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone conference call with Wall Street analysts
Wednesday, Motorola executives offered more detail, saying that the
third quarter write-off had created a $1.8 billion reserve related
to its exposure to Iridium.
</P>
<P>
   They said the announcement of an additional $500 million charge
in the coming quarter, if it occurred, would push the reserve to
$2.3 billion and represent the company's entire exposure to
Iridium.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the buildup in reserves, Motorola executives say they
still believe in the viability of Iridium, which has been hurt by
huge costs and a low subscriber base since it began operating
earlier in the year.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's announcement is further evidence that Motorola is
still deeply tethered to Iridium, a $6 billion system of about 66
low-orbit satellites that was expected to deliver communications to
``anyone, anytime, virtually anywhere in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   But most Wall Street analysts say Motorola is on sound financial
footing after reporting healthy third-quarter sales and profit
gains on Tuesday, a strong turnaround from a year earlier when
Motorola was faltering.
</P>
<P>
   The analysts say they largely view the Iridium situation as a
disturbing one, but one not likely to do substantial damage to
Motorola's balance sheet. Motorola has taken gradual steps to
inform analysts about its exposure and to prepare for the
possibility of a bankruptcy filing by Iridium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Motorola has taken a very prudent and conservative position on
Iridium,'' said Kenneth M. Leon, an analyst at ABN-AMRO. ``I'm not
concerned. They have prepared themselves very well. They have $4
billion in cash and cash equivalents on hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Iridium, which is based in Washington, is trying to rework its
debt and finances with the support of Motorola. And executives
close to the two companies say Craig McCaw, the cellular telephone
pioneer, is considering taking a huge stake in Iridium as a way to
help revive a venture he views as technologically sound.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola executives say the company will not commit any more
money to Iridium unless the company gets large commitments from
other investors. Motorola said, however, that there was a chance
additional costs would be incurred after a restructuring.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, Motorola is holding huge reserves to cover
everything from a $750 million loan it backed to investments and
financing provided for the ``gateway'' companies that sell the
satellite service for Iridium.
</P>
<P>
   It was scientists at Motorola who first developed the idea of a
global satellite system in the 1980s. Poor marketing and technical
glitches, however, were cited for getting the service off to a slow
start earlier this year and, before long, the company found itself
unable to finance its debt. &QL;

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the clearest indication yet that he is planning
to break with the Republican Party, Pat Buchanan has begun
notifying supporters that he will make a major speech on Oct. 25 in
Falls Church, Va., where he is widely expected to announce that he
will seek the Reform Party's nomination for president.
</P>
<P>
   Though Buchanan, the conservative commentator and former adviser
to Presidents Reagan and Nixon, has been signaling for weeks that
he would try to run on a third-party line, his campaign said on
Wednesday night that Buchanan had still not made a final decision
about his political future.
</P>
<P>
   But a close adviser to Buchanan said it was all but certain that
he would bolt the Republican Party and try to win a place on the
Reform Party ballot. ``I think it would be very unusual to schedule
a major room to not announce it,'' the adviser said. ``You can
count on it happening.''
</P>
<P>
   Much to Buchanan's apparent delight, talk of his running on an
independent line has roiled the Republican Party for weeks. Top
Republican officials, including Jim Nicholson, chairman of the
Republican National Committee, and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas,
the frontrunner for the party's presidential nomination, have
appealed to Buchanan to stay within the party and not play the
spoiler with a third-party candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   But his potential candidacy has also revealed deep fractures
within the Reform Party itself. Gov. Jesse Ventura of Minnesota,
the party's highest ranking elected official, has said he would
support a more moderate alternative to Buchanan. But Ross Perot,
the Texas billionaire who founded the party, has signaled through
intermediaries that Buchanan has his tacit support.
</P>
<P>
   Donald J. Trump, the developer, has formed an exploratory
committee to investigate a Reform Party candidacy. Trump, who calls
himself a fiscal conservative but a liberal on social issues, has
been mentioned by Ventura as a possible standard bearer for the
party.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan, an ardent isolationist, has fueled the media buzz
around his potential campaign by publishing a book earlier this
year, ``A Republic, Not an Empire,'' in which he questioned whether
Hitler had hostile intentions toward the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Russell J. Verney, chairman of the Reform Party, said on
Wednesday that Buchanan has not told him whether he plans to seek
the party's nomination. But if he does, Verney said, Buchanan will
have to explain his theories on World War II more clearly to party
members.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think one of the first things he should do is address these
charges that have been made against him in the commentary class
about his writings and views, so members of the Reform party can
have an understanding of his position,'' Verney said.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Reform Party has never been large _ just 50,000
people voted in its nominating contest in 1996 _ its impact on the
presidential race could be significant, political analysts say.
Because of Perot's presidential campaigns of 1992 and 1996, the
party has automatic slots on the ballot in 21 states and is
eligible to receive $12.6 million in federal funds. Perot won 19
million votes in 1992 and may have played a crucial role in helping
Bill Clinton win the general election by siphoning votes from
President George Bush.
</P>
<P>
   With his staunchly conservative credentials, Buchanan would
probably draw more votes from the Republican candidate, and for
that reason the campaign of George W. Bush has not wanted him to
mount a third-party candidacy. Bush has tried to avoid the
appearance of banishing Buchanan from the party, which might
increase Buchanan's credibility among disaffected conservatives. At
the same time, Bush has been criticized for not taking a stronger
stand against Buchanan's contention that American involvement in
World War II might not have been necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Mindy Tucker, a spokeswoman for Bush's campaign, said on
Wednesday that she would not comment on Buchanan's Reform Party
campaign until he makes it official.
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. John McCain of Arizona, who is also running for the
Republican nomination and has been sharply critical of Buchanan's
views on World War II, bid Buchanan good riddance from the
Republican Party. ``As I have said all along, I believe that Pat
Buchanan has already left the Republican Party,'' McCain said
through a spokesman. ``Today's news comes as no surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   The Reform Party does not use the traditional primary process to
select its presidential nominees, but rather relies on a
complicated process under which party members will cast ballots
during the party's national convention next August. Candidates are
also expected to try to get on the ballot via petitions in the 29
states where the Reform Party does not have automatic ballot lines.

 &HT;    Risks of delivering aid are rising worldwide
 &HT;    By Keith Graham
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Without doubt, this has been a bad week for the good
guys, the humanitarian workers who risk their own lives to make
others' lives safer, healthier and happier.
</P>
<P>
   Monday: In Kosovo, a U.N. worker was beaten by a mob, then shot
in the head. Valentin Krumov, fresh from completing a doctoral
program at the University of Georgia, had arrived in the troubled
Serbian province only that day. He had hoped to help re-establish
civilian government.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday: In Burundi, Hutu rebels attacked a U.N. humanitarian
convoy. They robbed everyone and killed nine people. Shot at
point-blank range were Burundi's UNICEF representative, Luis
Zuniga, and Saskia von Meijenfeldt, a logistics officer for the
World Food Program. Zuniga had devoted his career to helping
children. Von Meijenfeldt fed the hungry.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday: In Georgia's breakaway republic of Abkhazia, six U.N.
military observers and their translator were taken hostage. Part of
a force monitoring a truce in the region, the neutral observers
were in the process of delivering aid to refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Hearing about such incidents ``is very painful,'' said Kathleen
Egan, director of UNICEF Atlanta. ``And it's just happening too
much.''
</P>
<P>
   Is the world becoming a more dangerous place for humanitarian
workers? ``Absolutely,'' said Bob MacPherson, assistant director of
the emergency group for Atlanta-based CARE USA.
</P>
<P>
   MacPherson is CARE's leading expert on land mines and security
issues and does strategic assessments of security issues around the
world for CARE International.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, while helping CARE re-establish operations in
Kosovo, he became very familiar with the neighborhood where Krumov
died. This week, he returned to Atlanta from 16 days in East Timor,
which is attempting to assert its independence from Indonesia.
There, as in Kosovo, humanitarian workers are pouring in at the
same time U.N. peace-keeping troops are struggling to re-establish
a safe environment.
</P>
<P>
   In both cases, relief agencies have legitimate worries about the
security of their staffs. In neither case does MacPherson, a
retired Marine colonel, see aid workers as special targets.
</P>
<P>
   In East Timor, he said, he never felt especially threatened,
although concerns continue about the re-organization _ just across
the border in West Timor _ of militia groups that could re-ignite
violence. ``But I was very cautious,'' MacPherson said. He
generally worked in secure areas. When he asked about the safety of
an area and peacekeepers began their responses with the conditional
word ``Well ... ,'' he took note.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as I heard the word `Well,' I said we should keep our
people out of there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In general, for the last decade, humanitarian workers have
needed to act with extra caution, MacPherson said.
</P>
<P>
   One reason is that aid workers are increasingly sent into areas
where violent clashes have been led by ragtag militias and
paramilitary forces. ``Dealing with ill-trained or untrained
militias is definitely far worse than dealing with regular
armies,'' MacPherson said. Not only relief workers but also
civilians have been far more vulnerable to violent attacks in those
scenarios.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, humanitarian groups _ once universally accepted
as neutral _ have been actively targeted because they are seen
merely as representatives of Western society.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to violent attacks, kidnappings also have become
more common, MacPherson said. Some seem designed mainly to attract
publicity and make a point. In those cases, the victim may be
treated well. Other times, kidnappers are prepared to slice a
victim's throat.
</P>
<P>
   But some attacks occur simply because humanitarian workers, just
like anyone else, happen to be at the wrong place at the wrong
time: Someone wants to rip off a warehouse or steal a vehicle, or a
worker gets caught in cross fire.
</P>
<P>
   Often, the motives for attacks may have less to do with politics
than the fact that relief organizations of necessity move large
amounts of cash into chaotic situations.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you tell what makes someone pull the trigger even if
they just want to steal your watch?'' MacPherson said. ``I spend a
lot of time while I'm in some of these godforsaken places coming up
with ways to ensure that both the CARE workers and the funds we're
entrusted with are safe.''
</P>
<P>
   The challenges have made basic security training one of the
paramount concerns for many humanitarian agencies. ``There are
certain baseline skills we have to ensure our people have,''
MacPherson said.
</P>
<P>
   But dying in a violent attack is far from the only risk aid
workers face, he added quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``When everything is said and done, automobile accidents
absolutely lead the list of what causes death and injury in the
humanitarian community,'' MacPherson said.
</P>
<P>
   His best advice for workers abroad applies equally at home:
``Wear your seat belts, and drive sanely and safely.''

CHURCHGOERS REJOICE IN DEFEATING A STATE LOTTERY IN ALABAMA  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: S.C., Fla., Miss., La., Ga., N.D., Ark. and Okla.)   By DAVID FIRESTONE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTGOMERY, Ala. _ Wednesday was a day of jubilation for the
churchgoers of Alabama. To the dismay of a clearly shaken Gov.
Donald Siegelman, religious leaders led his plan for a state
lottery to firm defeat in a referendum on Tuesday, and there was
widespread rejoicing at their display of political force.
</P>
<P>
   ``Glory,'' said one woman who called in to a Christian radio
station in Opelika this morning. ``The Lord was with us in the
voting booth.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, in the words of Bob Russell, chairman of the Alabama chapter
of the Christian Coalition, ``The Red Sea just parted.''
</P>
<P>
   For years, gambling's once-improbable march through the Bible
Belt had seemed inexorable. There were casinos in Louisiana and
Mississippi, lotteries in Georgia and Florida, and video poker
machines in almost every gas station in South Carolina. Alabama had
only dog racing and bingo, but after Siegelman was decisively
elected last year on a platform consisting almost entirely of his
proposal for a lottery, the state seemed ready to join its
neighbors in the search for easy money.
</P>
<P>
   That all changed on Tuesday, when the driving force behind the
success of government-sponsored gambling _ the region's hostility
to taxes _ ran directly into a rock that may be even stronger here:
the power of the pulpit. There was barely a pastor in the state, of
any denomination, who did not issue fiery instructions to defeat
gambling as a moral corruption and an injustice to the poor. When
54 percent of the voters did just that on Tuesday, both sides
agreed that the church's role had been decisive.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an interfaith effort, people from all over, churches
that probably hadn't spoken to each other in years,'' said Tom
Blackerby, president of the American Family Association of Alabama,
a group of religious conservatives that campaigned against the
proposal. ``But this was a common cause that brought the churches
together.''
</P>
<P>
   As the Siegelman proposal envisioned it, a lottery would have
raised $150 million a year for education. With its defeat,
Alabamians will still find themselves with one of the worst
educational systems in the country. Other states are finding ways
to pay for preschool programs and guaranteed college scholarships,
but neither the governor nor his opponents have put forward a clear
plan to do so now that the lottery has been killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no Plan B,'' a chagrined the governor said at a news
conference in his office at the State Capitol Wednesday. ``My plan
was on the table yesterday. Now my door is open, my mind is open,
my arms are open, for any of those people who want to come in and
offer suggestions on how we can improve education for our
children.''
</P>
<P>
   As long as those plans do not include raising taxes, he added.
Alabama, with the lowest per-capita spending on education in the
country, also has the lowest per-capita state and local tax burden,
$100 a person less than the states ranked next-lowest, Mississippi
and Tennessee. But the governor said he would not consider a tax
increase to improve education.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I speak for the people of Alabama,'' he said. ``They
don't want their taxes raised, and I'm not going to do it. Can I
find the money? I don't know, but we're going to look. We're going
to do everything we can.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the governor said he would not put a revised lottery
proposal on the table, he vowed not to give up his hopes for
improved education, adding, ``I didn't get my black belt in karate
some years ago, I might add, by being a wuss.''
</P>
<P>
   Siegelman, a Democrat, run for governor in 1990 on a tax reform
platform, and his loss that year purged the idea from his playbook.
Similarly, for all its political strength, the anti-lottery
religious coalition has been criticized for being an essentially
negative force, knowing what it is against but not what it is for.
</P>
<P>
   ``The religious groups are outraged by private sins, but they
don't seem as concerned about social sins, like a third of the kids
in Alabama's public schools being poor,'' said Wayne Flint, a
prominent history professor at Auburn University. ``I haven't seen
them mobilize to this extent in favor of anything that might
actually improve education.''
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Gov. Steve Windom, a Republican, and Jim Cooper, chairman of
the state's largest anti-lottery group, Citizens Against Legalized
Lottery, spoke without detail Wednesday of using existing education
funds to pay for college scholarships. That could mean cutting
current programs, which the governor said was pointless, but they
said they believed the money could be found. ``If the scholarship
program was a high priority yesterday with the lottery, it should
still be today without it,'' said Windom, a vocal lottery opponent.
``I think we can pay for it with the growth in our budget, or with
pork spending.''
</P>
<P>
   D.L. Ireland, executive director of another leading anti-lottery
group, the Alabama Citizens Action Program, said voters might
consider a tax increase for education, but only after they were
convinced that current funds are being properly spent.
</P>
<P>
   That general mistrust of government is another important force
behind Tuesday's defeat, in which Alabama joined North Dakota,
Arkansas and Oklahoma as the only states to turn down a lottery.
Cooper's group focused its advertising on the lottery's potential
for corruption, and many voters said they did not believe that
officials of Alabama, never known for governmental efficiency,
could be trusted to use the money as promised. A recent
ticket-fixing scandal, in which it was revealed that high-ranking
Siegelman aides had traffic tickets dismissed, only contributed to
that sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a good while, you know, we were a dry county here,'' said
Bob D. Plunket, pastor of the Tuscumbia Church of Christ, in the
northwest corner of the state. ``And they told us if we'd just have
liquor, which was voted in, that it would solve our tax problems
and our school problems and we'd have plenty of money, and it was
never a reality. And I think people remembered that, for one
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the only areas of support for the lottery was the belt of
historically black counties through the lower middle of the state,
as well as the area around Birmingham, similar to areas where the
lottery is the most popular in other Southern states. Those
counties tend to be the poorest, with the largest percentage of
students in public school. The lottery failed in suburban and rural
areas, precisely the places where the idea of higher taxes for
schools is often the most repugnant.
</P>
<P>
   ``As strong as the religious opposition is to gambling, that's
where there's even stronger opposition to tax reform,'' said Flint,
of Auburn. suggesting that the anti-lottery vote might have a
silver lining. ``Maybe that's a sign of the maturing of the
culture, if people recognize that there's not going to be any magic
bullet to the problems that have plagued this region. But that's
only if this crisis winds up producing a solution.''

GORE WINS ENDORSEMENT OF AFL-CIO

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES &UR;  &LR; _ &UR;  &LR; Winning the biggest prize so far in the
presidential campaign, Vice President Al Gore on Wednesday gained
the AFL-CIO's endorsement and vowed to battle for working families,
although labor leaders urged him to work harder to win the hearts
and minds of union members.
</P>
<P>
   The endorsement came without the support of two of the nation's
most powerful unions, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters
and the United Auto Workers, and only after Gore had met privately
this week with several union leaders and promised more attention to
their concerns, like job losses caused by trade.
</P>
<P>
   After an extended entrance to the jaunty beat of blaring salsa
music, Gore thanked the AFL-CIO convention here for its support and
spoke to the heart of the argument that had prevailed earlier in
the debate whether to endorse now or later.
</P>
<P>
   ``The work of labor is to lead and not to follow,'' the vice
president said. The endorsement was made by voice vote among 700
delegates representing the labor federation's 13 million union
members.
</P>
<P>
   The AFL-CIO endorsement is a boon to candidates because the
federation includes 68 unions, prints millions of leaflets and,
perhaps better than any other group in society, can mobilize tens
of thousands of volunteers for phone banks, registration drives and
get-out-the-vote drives.
</P>
<P>
   Former Sen. Bill Bradley, Gore's rival for the Democratic
nomination, conceded in an interview Wednesday that he did not
believe he himself could win the endorsement of therkers or
the Teamsters, but he added, ``I think it's a significant gap in
(Gore's) support given the size of both unions.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's speech Wednesday to the organization underlined many of
the commitments that he made in private meetings with union leaders
in the last few days. With regard to one of labor's most pressing
issues, Gore pledged that any agreements he negotiated to expand
trade would not undercut American workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our president needs the authority to reach new trade
agreements to open new markets to our goods and services,'' he
said. ``But as president, I will also insist on the authority to
enforce worker rights, human rights and environmental protections
in those agreements. Trade should lift up living standards around
the world, not drag them down in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   He also indicated that he would take to heart union leaders'
advice that he should meet personally with members of local unions
across the nation. The Teamsters president, James P. Hoffa, told
Gore's campaign manager, Tony Coelho, that Gore could not win the
Teamsters support without doing so.
</P>
<P>
   Heeding the advice, Gore said in his speech, ``I want to work
alongside all of you in Iowa, in New Hampshire, in every state and
from every member of this AFL-CIO. I want to take this message
right to the grassroots. I need everyone of you to be with me, and
I am not taking a single vote for granted.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 20 minutes of debate before the vote, Hoffa said his
1.4-million member union was not ready to endorse, and in speaking
out so forcefully, he indicated he would be a power to reckon with
within organized labor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We disagree not necessarily with the candidate but with the
process,'' he said. ``I understand the need to lead, but I also
understand the need to listen. Now is the time to listen.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Hoffa said a crucial test would be how the Clinton
administration performs at a December meeting of the World Trade
Organization in Seattle, where some pro-business trade proposals
that worry labor unions are on the agenda.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is the vice president going to listen?'' Hoffa asked. ``We
hope so.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore was pressed on his trade views in the private meetings
here. George Becker, president of the United Steelworkers of
America, which was sitting on the fence, said he would back the
federation's endorsement of Gore but only after the vice president
promised to address the union's biggest concern, the loss of
manufacturing jobs.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Hoffa, who said his position should not be construed as
anti-Gore, added: ``Our members have made it clear they don't want
to be told how to vote. They want voting information, not
instruction. They want to know how the candidates we endorse will
affect their lives, and at this time, we still don't know that,
between these two candidates.''
</P>
<P>
   One teamsters delegate from Kentucky, Jerry Vincent, seconded
Hoffa's views about wanting to know more. ``In the South, we always
say, `Don't wrap that pig. Weigh it.' And we'd like to have it
weighed before it's wrapped,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   After promising to ``work my heart out to earn this
nomination,'' Gore concluded his speech with his new battle cry
that he will ``stay and fight.'' The reference was a thinly veiled
swipe at Bradley for quitting the Senate when many Democrats dug in
to fight what Gore described as an anti-union offensive by the
Republican Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also took some swipes at the Republican Congress and at
Gov. George W. Bush of Texas for not supporting an increase in the
minimum wage. He said they should ``stop paying off their special
interest friends on the backs of the working poor.''
</P>
<P>
   He vowed as president to buck any anti-union action. ``If they
send any anti-union bill to my desk, I'll ink up that veto pen, and
I'll hit them right between the eyes with a veto,'' he declared.
``You can count on that.''
</P>
<P>
   The delegates reacted enthusiastically, but not rapturously
during Gore's 37-minute speech in which he often ran right over his
applause lines.
</P>
<P>
   In an emotional plea before the endorsement vote, John Sweeney,
the AFL-CIO's president, said: ``Ours is a movement with an
extraordinary gift for hope. We must make it a movement with an
uncommon ability to act. In this compressed election season, I
believe that this endorsement at this time represents our best
ability to act and to make a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   In an admonition to those holding out, Sweeney added: ``When we
are unified we can move mountains.''
</P>
<P>
   The resolution acknowledged that Bradley ``has the respect of
many and a good record,'' but added: ``there is no question that Al
Gore is the presidential candidate most favored.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The resolution said that during Gore's seven years in the
Senate, he voted the pro-union position 88 percent of the time. It
did not note that Bradley voted with unions 86 percent of the time.
Gore had the second most pro-union voting record in the Senate,
after Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass..
</P>
<P>
   ``More than any other national leader,'' the resolution said,
``Al Gore has used the power of his office to defend the freedom of
workers to choose a union, free from interference by their
employers, and he has repeatedly urged other elected officials to
do the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking forcefully for Gore's endorsement was Gerald McEntee,
president of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal
Employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many unions in this hall who have called upon him
for help and assistance,'' he said. ``He has been there for us, he
has been there I think for most unions in this room, if not all
unions in this room.''

   The only player to lead the NBA in scoring, rebounds and assists
could not execute consistently a basketball action often mastered
by 12-year-olds: The free throw.
</P>
<P>
   When the nation in 1968 was shaken by a civil rights movement
seeking long-dustice, Chamberlain, who along with Muhammad
Ali may have been the world's most prominent black athletes,
endorsed Richard Nixon for president.
</P>
<P>
   The man who once averaged 48.5 minutes in a season for a
48-minute game (he played overtimes too) was sometimes criticized
for lacking competitive heart.
</P>
<P>
   For a player who remade basketball for all future big men, who
forced the rules writers to rejigger the game, who was the
7-foot-1, 275-pound acme of basketball's majestic power, his most
frequent contact with the game in his retirement was as a spectator
at Los Angeles Clippers' contests, where he was a pal of the club's
vile owner, Donald Sterling.
</P>
<P>
   For all his imagery as an invincible titan, he was probably too
soft, fearful of his power to injure. Said longtime rival and
friend Bill Russell of Chamberlain's famous 1970 Finals showdown
with gimpy-legged Willis Reed, who led the Knicks to victory over
the Lakers partly because Chamberlain seemed to back off:
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm the one playing Willis when he comes out limping, it
would only have emphasized my goal to beat them that much worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the behemoth Lothario who claimed to have bedded 20,000
women died Tuesday at home in bed, alone, never married.
</P>
<P>
   A man bigger than nearly all men and nearly all description,
Chamberlain's contradictions make him that much richer a character,
and so much more than a great ballplayer.
</P>
<P>
   Yet his ballplaying greatness has somehow been warped, not only
with time but through the green filter of Russell, his nemesis,
rival and friend whose unmatched career seemed fated to compromise
the game's most powerful, agile giant.
</P>
<P>
   As the pair locked up in a goateed grind in the low post
throughout the 1960s, it was Russell's Celtics who almost always
were superior to Chamberlain's Warriors, 76ers and Lakers teams.
Watching the NBA evolve on fuzzy black-and-white TVs, it seemed
that every winter Sunday was incomplete without at least a few
minutes spent watching Russell barely outmaneuver his formidable
adversary.
</P>
<P>
   Sports theater was rarely better. To witness two such skilled,
intelligent, dramatic rivals directly pitted against each other for
most of a decade was a national privilege, made all the more rare
by sports' failure to produce its like again.
</P>
<P>
   Russell's teams won 11 championships in 13 years, and he was
recently selected Sports Illustrated's greatest team player of all
time. Chamberlain's Philadelphia team of 1966-67 and his Laker team
of 1971-72 won titles, but it was never enough, even though those
teams may have been the best in league history.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all judged by the championships we win,'' said forlorn
Laker president Jerry West Tuesday, talking about his former
teammate and fellow 40-year hoop icon. ``Unfortunately, he only won
two.''
</P>
<P>
   Only won two.
</P>
<P>
   Think about that. Consider how many NBA greats, particularly in
the Michael Jordan era, never won a single one. But Chamberlain
seems forever consigned to secondary status because his foil had so
many more.
</P>
<P>
   The heat of their battle long since faded to cold embers,
Russell articulated, during the NBA All-Star game in 1997 that
featured the selection of its 50 greatest players, the truth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody seems to appreciate what an incredible player Wilt
was,'' he said. ``He was the best player of all time because he
dominated the floor like nobody else ever could. To be that big and
athletic was special.''
</P>
<P>
   That may be blasphemous in the recently concluded era of Jordan.
Comparisons between eras are always murky, as well as comparisons
between different positions. But there is one fact that usually
escapes consideration in the argument.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA of Chamberlain's time had about 100 players. The NBA
when Jordan dominated swelled to more than 300, meaning he came up
against nowhere near the caliber of competition Chamberlain took on
every night. Whether it was Russell or Reed, or Nate Thurmond, Walt
Bellamy or Wes Unseld, Chamberlain almost always ran into a quality
foe.
</P>
<P>
   He crushed 'em all.
</P>
<P>
   Forget the freakish, 100-point game. Those 50-point, 28-rebound
games that he (begin italic) averaged (end italic) didn't come
against Jim McIlvaine or Greg Ostertag. While 30 years of gene-pool
splashings may have improved the caliber of the average NBA
athlete, 30 years of expansion have spread those athletes around
much more broadly.
</P>
<P>
   Chamberlain in his prime today would be even more dominant than
in his day, because of the flatness of the surrounding territory.
And owing to growth of the NBA's popularity and the increase in
media coverage, his blunt, sometimes reckless personality would be
even more immense.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine a Dennis Rodman with brains, sophistication and
multidimensional talent.
</P>
<P>
   In his 1983 biography ``Giant Steps,'' Kareem Abdul-Jabbar wrote
about his hero worship as a kid of Chamberlain, his brief playing
rivalry as their careers crossed in the early 1970s, and of his
later contempt for his personal politics.
</P>
<P>
   But the game's giants eventually patched things up. And although
the book is filled with Abdul-Jabbar's belief of his superiority
over Chamberlain, he knew that in psychological as well as physical
stature, there was no one in the public mind quite like
Chamberlain.
</P>
<P>
   Abdul-Jabbar wrote: ``In airplanes and subways, on movie lines
or in the street, all big black guys were asked not, `Are you Bill
Russell?' but `Are you Wilt?' ''
</P>
<P>
   In his greatness, his contradictions and his foibles,
Chamberlain was a magnificent American original _ outsized, all
ways.

SPORTS COLUMN: DUQUETTE HAS THE RED SOX IN HIS BLOOD
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Most baseball general managers are strangers in town.
Most are hired to assemble a team for a franchise they know only
from the standings. To them, one city is not that much different
from any other. They sit at their office desk or in the ballpark.
It's their job, but no fan emotion is involved, no attachment to
the franchise history. No blood, so to speak.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Duquette is different.
</P>
<P>
   As the general manager of the Red Sox watched Wednesday night's
opener of the American League Championship Series, his team was
doing what he had been hoping to do since he was growing up in the
Berkshires near Pittsfield, Mass., where the Red Sox had a farm
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've wanted to play the Yankees for the pennant ever since I
was 10,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Now 41, he remembered going to Fenway Park with his father and
his older brother Dennis in 1967, the year the Red Sox lost the
World Series to the St. Louis Cardinals. He remembered players he
had seen in Wahconah Park in Pittsfield who went on to play for the
Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   ``George Scott was the first,'' he said. ``Billy Conigliaro,
Sparky Lyle, Carlton Fisk.''
</P>
<P>
   And in 1978, while an English literature major at Amherst, where
he caught Jeff Reardon, he was in Fenway Park when Bucky Dent hit
the home run that will always haunt Red Sox fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was sitting behind home plate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, when it appeared that the Red Sox were about to win the
World Series against the Mets at Shea Stadium, he was the Milwaukee
Brewers' scouting director.
</P>
<P>
   ``My brother called late that Saturday night,'' he remembered,
``and told me, `All we need is two more outs from Schiraldi.'''
</P>
<P>
   To him and his brother, ``we'' meant the Red Sox, but Calvin
Schiraldi never got those two outs. Mookie Wilson's grounder rolled
through first baseman Bill Buckner's legs; the Mets won that sixth
game and the seventh game. Another haunting memory for the Red Sox
and Dan Duquette, but he continued to climb baseball's front-office
ladder.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991 he was hired as the Montreal Expos' general manager, the
major leagues' youngest at the time. Early in 1994 he moved to the
Red Sox in the job he had always wanted.
</P>
<P>
   His autocratic style could be alienating. He kicked the Red Sox
icon and longtime coach Johnny Pesky upstairs. He talked to beat
writers only in a weekly conference call. After the 1996 season, he
described Roger Clemens as being ``in the twilight of his career.''
Clemens departed as a free agent to Toronto, where he earned two Cy
Young Awards. Before the 1997 season, Duquette hired Jimy Williams,
who has now managed the Red Sox to their first consecutive
postseason appearances since 1914-1915 when Babe Ruth was a
pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew Jimy from when he was Bobby Cox's first lieutenant with
the Braves, who shared a spring training facility with the Expos,''
he said. ``He knows how to bring young players along. When we lost
our closer, Tom Gordon, he did a great job of stabilizing this
team. And he had been a good manager in Toronto.''
</P>
<P>
   After the 1997 season, Duquette startled baseball by signing
free agent Pedro Martinez to a six-year, $75 million contract. He
knew all about the Dominican right-hander. As the Expos' boss, he
had obtained Martinez from Los Angeles in a trade for second
baseman Delino DeShields after the 1993 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1997 Pedro had a Cy Young year with the Expos that was
almost unparalleled,'' Duquette said. ``He was the first
right-hander since Walter Johnson in 1912 to have an ERA under two
and to strike out over 300.''
</P>
<P>
   With a 19-7 record, Martinez led the Red Sox to the 1998 wild
card, but after they lost to Cleveland in the division series, Mo
Vaughn, their popular slugger, departed as a free agent to the
Anaheim Angels. Without him, the Red Sox were not considered a
contender this season. But they earned the wild card, then stunned
the Indians in the division series.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question for the Red Sox,'' Duquette said, ``is not
whether we can put a good team out there, but whether the team can
withstand the movement of star players. We can do it. We've done
it.''
</P>
<P>
   More than anybody else, Pedro Martinez has helped them do it.
With a 23-4 record, a 2.40 ERA and 313 strikeouts, he will be voted
another Cy Young Award, if not the most valuable player award.
Monday night in Cleveland, his six no-hit innings in relief put the
Red Sox into this best-of-7 showdown with the Yankees for the AL
pennant.
</P>
<P>
   And ever since Dan Duquette was 10, that's all he has wanted.

 &HT;    For Ferraro, the goal is to get going
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNIONDALE, N.Y. _ Players who score 108 goals in one year in the
juniors don't take slumps well. Players who twice record 40-goal
seasons in the NHL and average more than 25 a year don't smile a
lot when their statistics after three games read: 0 goals, 0
assists, 5 penalties. Especially when the player was signed
specifically for his goal-scoring ability.
</P>
<P>
   When the Thrashers open a three-game trip tonight against the
New York Islanders, no player on the team will be looking to alter
the recent course of events more than Ray Ferraro.
</P>
<P>
   The veteran center said he has been plagued by bad starts most
of his career, but the situation this year has been magnified by
the Thrashers' lack of proven goal scorers and Ferraro's
determination that he can bounce back from two injury-plagued
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously I'm not happy with the way I've played,'' Ferraro
said. ``I know I was being counted on to score and I haven't done
it yet. I've been frustrated and I know that's the worst thing I
can do to myself. But it's only three games out of 82, so there's
still time.''
</P>
<P>
   The surroundings tonight could help. Ferraro had some of his
best career moments in his nearly five seasons with the Islanders
(1990-95); he scored 40 goals and had a career-high 80 points in
1991-92. The next year, he led the team in the playoffs with 13
goals in 18 games, and New York eliminated Pittsburgh and Mario
Lemieux before losing to Montreal in the league semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always like going back to places where I played before,''
Ferraro said. ``When we went to the semifinals in '93, that was the
most fun I've had in hockey. I don't like to see what's happened to
the franchise. Hopefully, (coach) Butch (Goring) can turn it
around.''
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, Ferraro wants to turn himself around. His frustrations
were evident Saturday against Buffalo when he drew consecutive
minor penalties in the second period, including elbowing the
Sabres' Rob Ray. According to Ferraro, Ray ``gave me a whack'' as
both exited the penalty box moments earlier. The penalty led to a
power-play goal that closed Atlanta's lead to 4-3 in the game that
wound up 5-5.
</P>
<P>
   In the opener Ferraro was slowed by a sore back, the result of a
check in the final exhibition e says the back is at 95
percent now. In the second game, a 7-1 loss to Detroit, Ferraro
missed three great scoring chances _ two breakaways and a
redirected pass from Mike Stapleton in the slot.
</P>
<P>
   Thrashers assistant general manager Les Jackson was the general
manager of Ferraro's junior team in Brandon, Manitoba, in 1983-84,
the season he scored 108 goals. Jackson also saw Ferraro bounce
back from knee injuries last season to play well down the stretch
for Los Angeles, leading Atlanta to sign him as an unrestricted
free agent. ``He's got some goals in him that he hasn't shown us
yet,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once he scores that first goal,'' coach Curt Fraser said,
``we'll see a different Ray Ferraro in the confidence department.
He's taking the load on his shoulders right now and he can't do
that. Instead of putting all this pressure on himself, he needs to
just go out and have fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferraro acknowledges that he hasn't had fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need to play a simple game, move the puck and go to the
net,'' he said. ``I need to get myself into position to score.''
</P>
<P>
   With his stick, not his elbow.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Kenny Rogers could only wait, pounding the ball
mindlessly into his glove, as pitching coach Dave Wallace and Mike
Piazza converged on the mound. The agony of that moment was
achingly familiar for Rogers, whose long, ugly postseason history
had just taken on a miserable new addition.
</P>
<P>
   The pitcher who was vilified as a New York Yankee for three
horrible postseason starts in 1996, who had lost to the Arizona
Diamondbacks in the division series last week in his only other
playoff start, turned away as the second home run he had yielded to
the Braves in the space of five sixth-inning pitches sailed over
the wall. Rogers stared at the backstop and into the deep, 0-2 hole
into which the Mets' league championship fortunes rapidly sunk with
the 4-3 loss.
</P>
<P>
   The best-of-7 series moves to Shea Stadium for three games, but
Bobby Valentine's reaction to Eddie Perez's home run _ which gave
the Braves a two-run lead _ told the story of how this series has
gone against the Mets. He ripped off his cap in disgust and threw
it to the ground. The Mets have now lost 11 of 14 games to the
Braves this season _ seven out of eight in the last three weeks _
and their continuing futility at the plate (John Olerud, Mike
Piazza and Robin Ventura are 1-for-21 in this series and 1-for-7
with runners in scoring position) is swallowing their hopes of
making it to the World Series as surely as the two home runs Rogers
gave up. An hour later, Valentine admitted he regretted leaving his
starter _ who lasted longer than he ever had in the postseason, and
who was pitching a shutout until the sixth _ in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no reason to keep him in,'' Valentine said. ``I left him
in, and it was absolutely the wrong move.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogers had gone 5-1 with a 4.00 earned run average since coming
from Oakland in a pre-trade deadline deal. But his postseason
struggles are the stuff of legend. With the Yankees in 1996, he
went 0-0 with a 14.14 ERA in three postseason starts _ one of them
in Atlanta in the World Series. His longest outing then was just
three innings. Last week, Rogers managed to make it into the fifth
against Arizona, but he took the Mets' only loss of the division
series.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's history,'' Rogers said. ``Every game is over. I don't
look back on years' past postseasons. I don't think that's a good
barometer. These two starts could have been better, but I don't
think I pitched badly. It will come sooner or later.''
</P>
<P>
   But Wednesday, there was only more disappointment. Despite the
2-0 lead the Mets hn him with a Roger Cedeno single that
scored Robin Ventura in the second, and a Melvin Mora solo home run
in the fifth, Rogers had not pitched terribly well. Two pickoffs
and two double plays erased four of the eight baserunners he
allowed in the first five innings. But in the sixth inning, with
one out, Rogers began to unravel. He walked Chipper Jones on a full
count. Then, on a 1-0 pitch, he threw a changeup outside to Brian
Jordan. Jordan had killed the Mets during the regular season,
batting .359 with three home runs, three triples and 13 runs batted
in and he had been even hotter against Houston in the division
series, driving in eight runs in four games. Rogers was shocked
when Jordan sent the pitch, which he thought was a good one, to the
opposite field, where it ticked off the foul screen for a two-run
home run that tied the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think he had taken an opposite field swing,'' Rogers
said. ``Hitters are a lot better than in the past. They're
stronger. You can't make a mistake because they can take any pitch
out of the park.''
</P>
<P>
   The next batter was Andruw Jones, who had already singled twice.
Surely, Valentine would bring in a reliever. But he did not, and it
is that decision that cost the Mets the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure he wishes he had pulled me,'' Rogers said. ``Me,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogers threw the only mistake he thought he made, a two-seam
fastball that Jones slapped for a single to left. Again, Rogers
remained in the game, to face Eddie Perez, the catcher who had
smacked a home run in Game 1. Rogers decided his first pitch would
be a sinker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have great movement on the pitch,'' Rogers said. ``It
just wasn't as good as I wanted. I'd throw it again.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentine probably wishes he wouldn't. Perez smashed the pitch
to left field, and the home run gave the Braves a 4-2 lead.
Finally, Valentine took Rogers out and Turk Wendell got out of the
inning. But Braves starter Kevin Millwood, who took the win, had
grown stronger with each inning. He retired the Mets in order in
the seventh before the Mets had their final gasp in the eighth.
With one out, Mora, who was playing for a flu-ridden Rickey
Henderson, reached first on a fielding error by Chipper Jones.
Edgardo Alfonzo, who was 2-for-4 Wednesday, doubled to center to
score Mora. But then Atlanta Manager Bobby Cox called on closer
John Rocker, who saved Game 1 and the three games of Atlanta's
late-season sweep over the Mets at Turner Field. Rocker exploited
the Mets' failures at the plate. He struck out Olerud, the bat
flying out of Olerud's hands on the final swing. After
intentionally walking Piazza, Rocker struck out Ventura, who is
hampered by a mildly strained right shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to do well,'' said Ventura. ``We just haven't done
it. It's happened at other times of the year. It's like golf. When
you miss an opportunity, you don't get to go back and redo it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets didn't even get an opportunity in the ninth. Cox
replaced Rocker with John Smoltz, who is scheduled to start Game 4
of the series and who had never made a major-league relief
appearance before. The Mets went from facing a fireballer in Rocker
to a sidearmer in Smoltz. Good luck. Pinch hitter Shawon Dunston
popped up, and Cedeno grounded out. Rey Ordonez had made the last
out of Game 1 and Valentine, when asked why he didn't pinch hit for
him, said he could not envision a scenario in which he would.
Valentine must have had a change of heart. Up came Bobby Bonilla,
who had just five pinch hits all season and none in the postseason.
He took three strikes, looking appalled at each one, without ever
moving his bat. Bonilla complained later about the calls, but it
hardly mattered. The Mets are back to where they were two weeks
ago, reeling and searching for a way to save themselves. This time,
though, there is little room for error.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had our backs against the wall,'' Ventura said. ``We've
been there for two weeks. It feels normal to us. You learn until
you're dead, you're still alive. Nothing is over yet, but you
better start winning some, because we're running out of games.''

 &HT;    Huge purses not a draw for everyone
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Something is missing from the Tour Championship this
year. And it won't be any different when the event returns to
Atlanta's East Lake Golf Club in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The 1999 PGA Tour money champion might not be determined in the
$5million Tour Championship with its $900,000 first prize, Oct.
28-31, at Champions Golf Club in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Odd as it might seem, no longer does the Tour Championship end
the official PGA Tour money season. It isn't over until the next
week's $5 million American Express Championship, Nov. 4-7 at the
Valderrama Golf Club in Sotogrande, Spain. It is the third World
Golf Championship event of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The WGC event will count for all the applicable money lists. It
is open to the top 50 players on the Official World Golf Rankings,
the top 30 from the PGA Tour money list, the top 20 from Europe and
top three from Japan, Australasia and South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   When PGA Tour commissioner Tim Finchem and the other pooh-bahs
of the world tours created the WGC events, they envisioned the Tour
Championship and the American Express Championship as a two-week,
worldwide money showdown. If a world money list evolves, perhaps
then the two events will blend. But as things stand, both the PGA
Tour and European Tour players seemed to think everything was fine
before.
</P>
<P>
   American Justin Leonard joins the majority of PGA Tour players
who would rather see the WGC event played the week before the Tour
Championship, if the former has to be played.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably so,'' Leonard said. ``It's strange, and I think David
Duval put it very well, that a European player could decide who
wins our money list (and vice versa). That would be my only
criticism.''
</P>
<P>
   A few prominent names might be no-shows, Duval, in particular.
In early spring, Duval half-seriously hoped for a money lead of
$1,000,001 in order to bag the Spain event and still guarantee the
title. But even though he trails Tiger Woods by nearly $800,000,
Duval apparently does not have Spain on his schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm playing in Houston in our Tour Championship and I've got a
couple of opportunities after that, all in the States,'' Duval said
last week at Kingsmill.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the PGA Tour should have reduced the price on the $6,200
charter it has organized from Houston to Malaga, Spain, Oct. 31. A
few million bucks in earnings just doesn't reach as far as it used
to.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard plans to attend, but he said, ``I don't think I would be
too harsh on a player who doesn't go.''
</P>
<P>
   It says something about the financial explosion in golf when a
player can bypass a field of approximately 60 players that pays a
minimum of $25,000 and $1 million to the winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can play well those two weeks and pass a lot of guys on
the money list,'' Leonard said. ``It's something to get excited
for. The public wants to see the best in the world playing against
each other as much as possible, and we have two weeks like that
back to back.''
</P>
<P>
   It might not be a reason for skipping Spain, but some U.S. Ryder
Cup players are bracing for some post-Brookline celebration
reaction at the site of the 1997 matches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'll catch some flak,'' Leonard said. ``I'm hoping
that people start to put that behind them.''

PLEDGES OF EXTRADITION ACCOMPANY COLOMBIAN DRUG ARRESTS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By BARRY MEIER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Justice Department announced Wednesday that
Colombian officials had arrested the head of that nation's largest
cocaine trafficking ring and other drug traffickers and had pledged
to move quickly to extradite them to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Colombia has not extradited drug traffickers to this country
since 1990, after a wave of terror by drug cartels that involved
the assassination of government officials and bombings. In 1997, it
changed its constitution to permit extradition, and the Justice
Department is currently seeking to bring 10 Colombians to stand
trial in the United States on drug charges.
</P>
<P>
   Among 31 people arrested in early morning raids Wednesday in
Colombia and Mexico were Alejandro Bernal Madrigal, whom a federal
official described as the head of the biggest cocaine ring in
Colombia, and Fabio Ochoa, a member of the Medellin cartel.
</P>
<P>
   The latest arrests come as Colombia is seeking $3.5 billion in
international aid, mostly from the United States, to combat drug
trafficking and leftist insurgents and to prop up its faltering
economy.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference here Wednesday, Luis Alberto Moreno,
Colombia's ambassador to the United States, said that the Colombian
government and its judicial system will review extradition requests
for the suspects and fulfill those deemed legally warranted.
</P>
<P>
   ``They will be certainly extradited to the United States,'' said
Moreno.
</P>
<P>
   Both U.S. and Colombian officialsn interviews that they
believed that the extradition of Colombians for trial in this
country could have a significant impact on drug trafficking.
Colombian courts have often handed out light sentences and drug
lords have continued to operate from jails.
</P>
<P>
   But Michael Shifter, a senior fellow with the Inter-American
Dialogue, a policy institute here, said he doubted such moves would
have much impact.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a mistake to look at this as something that marks a
major step in the drug war,'' said Shifter, who has studied drug
issue. ``It is not going to make a difference in American cities
that a few Colombians are going to be extradited to the U.S.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials estimated that those arrested were part of an
operation that may have been responsible for shipping between 20
tons to 30 tons of cocaine monthly from Columbia through Mexico to
the United States and Europe. That would represent as much as
one-third of the cocaine consumed in this country.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials said that the drug ring used four different
routes to send cocaine to the United States, including shipping the
drug by shrimp boats and in deliveries of frozen fruit pulp
produced by plants controlled by the drug gang.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our estimation, this was the most significant cocaine
trafficking operation in Colombia today,'' William Ledwith, chief
of the Drug Enforcement Administration's office of international
operations, said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   The Colombia ring also operated closely with drug traffickers in
Mexico, including an operation once run by Amado Carillo Fuentes,
who was at one time that country's top drug smuggler.
</P>
<P>
   A senior DEA official who asked not to be identified said that
the investigation was particularly significant because, although
the inquiry was conducted by officials in Colombia, the United
States and other countries, those charged with crimes had been
indicted only in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, most Colombians facing drug charges, including the
leaders of the Cali and Medellin cartels, were charged both in the
United States and Columbia. That allowed them to be tried in
Colombia and receive more lenient sentences than they were likely
to have received in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Those arrested Wednesday on drug trafficking and money
laundering charges were indicted on Sept. 30 by a federal jury in
Miami. The charges were unsealed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Ledwith, of the DEA, said that the drug trafficking headed by
Bernal had emerged a few years ago to fill the void left by the
deaths or arrests of the heads of the Medellin and Cali cartels.
</P>
<P>
   For much of the 1990s, the issue of extradition was a source of
tension and friction between U.S. and Colombian officials. American
authorities argued that Colombia's refusal to extradite its
citizens reflected its ambivalence toward the drug trade. But
Columbians also had to confront a wave of terrorist acts by drug
traffickers opposed to facing trial in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Moreno said in an interview that Colombians' attitudes toward
extradition began to shift about four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people came to recognize that extradition is a very
useful tool in fighting the war on drugs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The change in the country's law, in December 1997, only applies
to those charged with crimes after that date.
</P>
<P>
   One DEA official said the agency was pleased with how Columbia
officials were handling the pending requests, which he estimated
could take anywhere from one to two years to resolve.
</P>
<P>
   Extradition requests for those arrested Wednesday will be made
in coming weeks, the official said.

 &HT;    Falcons try to solve slyness of the Rams
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ On Sept. 26 in St. Louis, confusion reigned in the
Falcons' secondary.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams ``flat-out looked All-World,'' free safety Eugene
Robinson said.
</P>
<P>
   If the Falcons (1-4) are going to win the rematch Sunday in the
Georgia Dome, they must slow down the 4-0 Rams.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, St. Louis bolted to a 21-0 lead before the Falcons
ran their fifth offensive play. They led 28-0 at the half and won
35-7.
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons didn't slow the running game, either, but they were
done in mostly by the Rams' passing attack. Kurt Warner completed
12 of 17 passes for 190 yards and three touchdowns in the first
half.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis coach Dick Vermeil's offense made it happen mainly by
moving backs and receivers around. In turn, the Falcons tried to
counter by moving defenders around, sometimes before the snap,
trying to preserve matchups.
</P>
<P>
   It was a disaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``They really got us on our heels because we were moving,''
Robinson said. ``Hopefully, we can alleviate that problem by
getting set up and not worrying about who's at the `X' spot and
who's at the `Y' spot.''
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons won't be running around as much in the secondary
Sunday, although defenses usually have to follow a man in motion.
</P>
<P>
   One option might be to double-team wide receiver Isaac Bruce and
put one man on rookie Torry Holt, depending on alignment.
Sometimes, however, they are on the same side.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difficulty is they move around in so many formations,''
Falcons coach Dan Reeves said.
</P>
<P>
   Cornerback Ray Buchanan, on the wrong end of touchdown
receptions by Holt and Bruce that day, concedes it might be time to
simplify matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they did pretty good was game-plan us,'' he said. ``They
knew what we were in, but a lot of times we didn't know what they
were going to be in. A lot of what they did we didn't see in
film.''
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons' defensive pressure has to start with the pass rush.
Warner was not sacked and rarely was pressured in the first
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're sitting back there massaging the ball, I don't care
what quarterback it is, any quarterback can look good,'' Buchanan
said.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive end Lester Archambeau agreed. ``You can't lay a
measure on it,'' he said. ``It is immensely important (to pressure
the passer). You can't let a guy who is that accurate have time to
throw the ball ... and the DBs (must) bump those (wide receivers)
and disrupt their routes.''
</P>
<P>
   The Falcons failed to jam the receivers at the line, Robinson
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their receivers got off the ball. It was free access,'' he
said. ``We didn't do a good job of getting in their faces. That has
to stick in your craw. If it doesn't, something is wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked like we were in high school and they were world
champions,'' Robinson said. ``I anticipate this go-around is going
to be starkly different.''

</P>
<P>
   After warning last month of an earnings shortfall, Apple
Computer reported results for its fourth quarter that exceeded
revised estimates. Apple executives also predicted strong sales for
the quarter ended in December. Apple earned $111 million, or 63
cents a diluted share, compared with $106 million, or 68 cents a
share, in the period a year earlier. Analysts had expected Apple to
earn 45 cents. That number would have been reachable but for the
limited availability of microprocessors, said Steve Jobs, Apple's
interim chief executive.

BLACKS LESS LIKELY TO HAVE LUNG CANCER SURGERY, SAYS STUDY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds.: Resending to delete graphic note)   By DENISE GRADY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Black patients with early-stage lung cancer are less
likely than whites to undergo life-saving surgery, and as a result
are more likely to die of their disease, doctors are reporting
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Peter B. Bach, a lung specialist at Memorial Sloan-Kettering
Cancer Center in Manhattan and an author of the report, said the
reason for the disparity was unknown. But Bach said it was not
because of the differences between the races in socioeconomic
status, insurance, general health or access to medical care.
</P>
<P>
   Among the possible causes, the researchers said, are that
doctors do not recommend surgery to blacks as often as to whites,
or that blacks more often refuse surgery, perhaps because of poor
doctor-patient communication.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a bad situation where patients with potentially curable
disease are not having surgical treatment and therefore are
dying,'' Bach said. He and his co-authors said it was imperative
that doctors acted to make sure that black patients got the lung
surgery they needed. ``It's extremely important that we figure out
what's happening,'' Bach said. ``We're talking about saving a lot
of lives.''
</P>
<P>
   The study by Bach and three other researchers is being published
Thursday in the New England Journal of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Hugh Stallworth, a national vice president of the American
Cancer Society, said, ``This study suggests that, possibly,
physicians are treating cancer patients not just based upon their
illness and recommended treatment, but on the basis of their
race.'' Stallworth said other studies had also suggested that the
providers of health care treated patients differently on the basis
of race or ethnic group.
</P>
<P>
   ``So this is not new,'' Stallworth said. ``But each time we hear
it, it's surprising and rather shocking, specifically as it relates
to cancer. It's quite concerning.''
</P>
<P>
   He and Bach said that the findings come at a critical period in
lung cancer research in the United States. A study published in
July suggested that a test called spiral C.T., or computed
tomography, could detect lung cancers at an earlier stage than
standard methods, and increase the rate of cure for the disease. If
that test fulfills its promise, and nothing is done to eliminate
the racial disparity, the gap in the lung cancer death rate might
even increase.
</P>
<P>
   Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in the United
States, killing more than 150,000 people a year. The people in
Bach's study all had the most common form of the disease,
non-small-cell lung cancer. The study was based on the medical
records of 10,984 patients (860 black and 10,124 white) 65 years
old and over who were found to have an early stage of the disease
from 1985 to 1993. Surgery is the treatment of choice for such
patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without surgery, half the patients are dead in a year,'' Bach
said. ``With surgery, it takes more than four years for half to
die.''
</P>
<P>
   Among whites, 76.7 percent had surgery. But only 64 percent of
the blacks did.
</P>
<P>
   ``For every five whites that had surgery, only four blacks
did,'' Bach said.
</P>
<P>
   Survival differed as well: five years after the diagnosis, 34.1
percent of whites, but only 26.4 percent of blacks, were still
alive. But when patients who had surgery were compared, five-year
survival rates were similar: 42.9 percent for whites, 39.1 percent
for blacks; the difference was not meaningful statistically, and
may have been due in part to the fact the overall longevity is
lower for blacks than for whites.
</P>
<P>
   The authors studied people 65 and over because medical
information on them was available through the Medicare program.
They cautioned that it is not known if the findings applied to
younger patients.
</P>
<P>
   The records did not disclose why some patients did not have
surgery. But Bach said they provided enough information to prove
that the unequal surgery rates could not be blamed on differences
between the races in socioeconomic status, insurance, sex,
complicating illnesses or access to care. Rather, the disparity
appeared to depend entirely on race itself, the researchers said.
</P>
<P>
   But the researchers could not say if doctors were less likely to
recommend surgery to black patients, or if black patients
themselves were more likely to refuse surgery.
</P>
<P>
   But Stallworth said, ``I can't believe that number of people
would not avail themselves of the recommended treatment, if the
information is presented in the right way, in a sensitive and
knowledgeable way.''
</P>
<P>
   But there may be communication gaps, he said. If doctor and
patient cannot establish a rapport, the patient may be reluctant to
take the doctor's advice, and the doctor may give up, feeling he or
she has made a good-faith effort to help.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that patients, black and white, feel more comfortable
with physicians that are like them, look like them and sound like
 Stallworth said. ``And physicians relate better to patients
who are more like them.''
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, 12 percent of the population is black, but
only 4 percent of doctors are.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``What has been suggested is that we may need to look at our
medical training programs and begin to introduce some type of
cultural sensitivity,'' Stallworth said. ``Some would even go
further and say we need to introduce some human sensitivity. This
transcends culture. It's one human being talking to another human
being.''
</P>
<P>
   It has also been suggested that more minority doctors are
needed, but Stallworth said that while he agreed, that was no way
to solve cultural misunderstandings. If doctor and patient cannot
communicate, regardless of racial background, ``you have a serious,
serious problem,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In an editorial accompanying the study, Dr. Talmadge E. King
Jr., chief of Medical Services at San Francisco General Hospital,
said racial differences could be a barrier to effective
communication. ``I think there's a very, very complex interaction
we need to understand better so that we can partner with patients
who may not feel comfortable interacting with us,'' King said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   King said that at his hospital, more than half the patients were
black or Hispanic, and 20 percent were Chinese. Each group, he
said, has slightly different attitudes about medical care.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a huge issue we deal with,'' King said. ``We are
acutely aware of it, and trying to do better.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   King, who is black, said that some black patients tended to be a
bit more fatalistic and religious than whites, and to believe that
God would take care of them.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Because of those beliefs, he said, it can be harder to convince
them that treatment is necessary.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   ``If a patient is talking to a majority physician who is not
familiar with the background and and doesn't think through how to
approach this patient, there can be delays in care,'' King said.
``And the patient moves from being an operable candidate to
becoming inoperable during this period of miscommunication. This is
a ticking time bomb.''

SPORTS COLUMN: JOHN SMOLTZ DISCOVERS `THE RUSH' 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Three hundred and eighty times John Smoltz had entered
a major-league game, but always with the measured pace of a
starting pitcher who cannot get too rambunctious too soon.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, John Smoltz tried it a different way, leaving the
bullpen in the ninth inning. He literally did not know what to do.
Should he run in with the quarter-miler stride of the Braves' own
Galloping John Rocker? Should he stroll to the mound with the
banker's poise of a starting pitcher?
</P>
<P>
   It was all a mystery to Smoltz. All he knew was that the Braves
had a one-run lead on the Mets in the ninth inning, and that his
team dearly hoped to take a two-game lead into the Boschian depths
of Shea Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Smoltz is second in longevity to Tom Glavine, the only two
Braves who have been here for the eight division titles, the four
World Series, the one world championship. So far, that is.
</P>
<P>
   The team keeps evolving, but Glavine and Smoltz have been the
constants; Glavine a wiry left-hander who still has never relieved
in 424 games, regular and postseason, and Smoltz, a durable
right-hander who had pitched 356 first innings in the regular
season and 24 more first innings in the postseason, but had never
pitched out of the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody can start,'' Smoltz would say later with a touch of
gallantry, ``but I don't know that everybody can relieve.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, he had volunteered to pitch relief a few times in the past
when the Braves had a gap in the bullpen, but Bobby Cox had always
declined the offer. A few times Smoltz had passed the evening in
the somewhat neurotic company of relief pitchers, whose twitches
make them first cousins to such haunted souls as hockey goalies and
football place-kickers.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you start, you can work your way into it,'' Smoltz said
Wednesday. ``When you relieve, you have to be ready right away.''
</P>
<P>
   He is to be the starting pitcher in Saturday's fourth game. He
last started last Saturday as the Braves mopped up Houston.
Starting pitchers always throw between starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been with John Smoltz for 12 years,'' said Leo Mazzone,
the stubby pitching coach who constantly rocks forward and backward
on the dugout bench. ``There isn't one thing John Smoltz can't
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Cox has already used Kevin Millwood and Greg Maddux in the first
round of the playoffs. When Smoltz volunteered to pitch an inning
Wednesday, if needed, Maddux gave him advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me, `Don't try to get all your pitches working,'''
Smoltz recalled afterward. ```Just find a few that are working and
go with them.'''
</P>
<P>
   Smoltz ambled out to the bullpen in the fifth inning, unsure he
would be needed, but he started loosening up when Rocker blew away
the Mets in the top of the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   And then the bullpen phone rang. A decade plus in the major
leagues, and the bell had never tolled for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first thought was, `Who could I possibly face?''' Smoltz
said.
</P>
<P>
   He semi-jogged in from the bullpen, without the thundering
footsteps or maniacal glares or exaggerated resin-bag tossings of
career relief pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   But even without trying to stoke himself up, Smoltz discovered
the nutty little secret of relief pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rush,'' he called it. The sudden supply of energy that, in
more life-threatening situations, allows a mother to lift the rear
end of a car to save her baby.
</P>
<P>
   Smoltz already knew he had a good fastball working, and he
forgot about the other pitches in his repertory. He retired Shawon
Dunston on a pop fly to short left field. He got Roger Cedeno to
ground out to shortstop. And that brought up Bobby Bonilla as a
pinch-hitter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know he bats primarily from the left side,'' Smoltz said.
``I was going to pitch him outside. If he got a single, he got a
single.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Bonilla looked at a third strike, and the Braves had a
4-3 victory. But Smoltz displayed none of the panache of a Dennis
Eckersley pumping his fists or the swashbucklers who close
imaginary doors or blow away the smoke from imaginary six-shooters.
He had not thought it through.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes you appreciate what a great job our relief pitchers
do,'' Smoltz would say later. ``This is nice. This is great.''
</P>
<P>
   He had packets of ice strapped to his right arm. The physical
work he had done was no more than what he ordinarily would do to
prepare for the 381st start on Saturday. But in his eyes there was
the trace of the secret life of the relief pitcher. John Smoltz's
life may never be the same.

 &HT;    Midseason report has some A's and F's
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Here at the halfway point of the season, we present
the highlights and lowlights of the season to date:
</P>
<P>
   _ Biggest surprise: Michigan State, which was barely on the
radar screen when the season began and is 6-0 and ranked No. 5. The
Spartans still have a lot of work to do, but a Nov. 20 game at home
with Penn State could be a blockbuster. The Spartans had better be
careful Saturday at Purdue.
</P>
<P>
   _ Biggest disappointment: The behavior of Florida State wide
receiver Peter Warrick, whose suspension on charges of felony theft
could cost him the Heisman Trophy. Warrick passed up NFL millions
to come back to school and gets done in by Tommy Hilfiger.
</P>
<P>
   _ Best game: Florida State 41, Georgia Tech 35. It gave the
whole country a chance to find out what we already knew _ Tech QB
Joe Hamilton is a great football player. Honorable mention: Army
59, Louisville 52, in double overtime.
</P>
<P>
   _ Best conference: No debate this season. With Penn State,
Michigan State, and Michigan in the top 10, and with Wisconsin,
Ohio State, and Purdue not far behind, it's the Big Ten in a
walkover.
</P>
<P>
   _ Worst conference: Another easy choice. The Pac-10 has a
combined record of 28-26 and no team ranked in this week's Top 25.
Halfway through the season, every team in the conference has at
least two losses. The Rose Bowl must be excited.
</P>
<P>
   _ Teams to watch in the second half: Mississippi State (6-0),
Syracuse (5-1), Texas (5-2), Tennessee (4-1).
</P>
<P>
   _ Biggest upset: East Carolina 27, Miami 23. The Pirates rallied
from a 20-0 deficit to post one of the biggest wins in school
history.
</P>
<P>
   MIDSEASON COACHES OF THE YEAR
</P>
<P>
   ACC: George O'Leary, Georgia Tech
</P>
<P>
   SEC: Jackie Sherrill, Mississippi State
</P>
<P>
   Big Ten: Nick Saban, Michigan State
</P>
<P>
   Big East: Frank Beamer, Virginia Tech
</P>
<P>
   Big 12: Bill Snyder, Kansas State
</P>
<P>
   Pac-10: No winner.
</P>
<P>
   MIDSEASON PLAYERS OF THE YEAR
</P>
<P>
   ACC: QB Joe Hamilton, Georgia Tech
</P>
<P>
   SEC: QB Tee Martin, Tennessee
</P>
<P>
   Big Ten: WR Plaxico Burress, Michigan State
</P>
<P>
   Big East: DE Corey Moore, Virginia Tech
</P>
<P>
   Big 12: QB Major Applewhite, Texas
</P>
<P>
   Pac-10: No winner
</P>
<P>
   WORTH NOTING
</P>
<P>
   _ For the seventh time in the history of the series, but for the
second time in three seasons, neither Notre Dame nor Southern
California will be ranked when they meet on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   _ Virginia Tech plays Syracuse on Saturday for homecoming. In
the Hokies' past two homecoming games, they have lost to Temple
(28-24) and Miami of Ohio (24-7). Both times, Virginia Tech was
undefeated.
</P>
<P>
   _ Former Kentucky football player Jeremy Streck, a starter at
offensive guard last season, died Saturday after he was struck by a
car. He was 23.
</P>
<P>
   WORTH QUOTING
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that's a fair assessment, because, if that's the
case, then we don't need to play the gam   Reggie Germany, Ohio State receiver on comments from coach John
Cooper that the Buckeyes would have to play a perfect game to beat
Penn State.
</P>
<P>
   JUST THINKING
</P>
<P>
   _ SMU was passed over for membership in Conference USA this week
for several reasons. But the main reason is that the football
program is 0-5 and is in the middle of a new investigation into
possible wrongdoing. The ``death penalty'' placed on the Mustangs
in the 1980s is still affecting the program.
</P>
<P>
   _ Penn State coach Joe Paterno has put all but three of his
players off limits to the media in the days leading up to
Saturday's game with Ohio State. Could be that Joe Pa is more
worried about the Buckeyes than the media. Ohio State has won four
of the past six meetings.
</P>
<P>
   _ When it comes to the Heisman Trophy, let's not forget about
Ron Dayne just yet. The Wisconsin running back needs to average
172.8 yards in his final five games to break the NCAA rushing
record.
</P>
<P>
   BY THE NUMBERS
</P>
<P>
   1-9: Combined record of Rutgers and West Virginia, who play
Saturday in Morgantown.
</P>
<P>
   269: Rushing yards for Army's Michael Wallace last week against
Louisville, for an academy record.
</P>
<P>
   36.7: Yards rushing per game allowed by Michigan State, best in
the nation.
</P>
<P>
   14-3: Combined record of the three Division I teams from the
state of Mississippi _ Mississippi State, 6-0; Mississippi 5-1;
Southern Miss 3-2.

WILT CHAMBERLAIN: GIANT CONTRADICTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ To the generation of basketball fans who have grown up
since Wilt Chamberlain retired: You have no idea.
</P>
<P>
   Not just about the the enormity of the man, who was then dwarfed
by his staggering accomplishments. But about the contradictions.
</P>
<P>
   The only player to lead the NBA in scoring, rebounds and assists
could not execute consistently a basketball action often mastered
by 12-year-olds: The free throw.
</P>
<P>
   When the nation in 1968 was shaken by a civil rights movement
seeking long-denied justice, Chamberlain, who along with Muhammad
Ali may have been the world's most prominent black athletes,
endorsed Richard Nixon for president.
</P>
<P>
   The man who once averaged 48.5 minutes in a season for a
48-minute game (he played overtimes too) was sometimes criticized
for lacking competitive heart.
</P>
<P>
   For a player who remade basketball for all future big men, who
forced the rules writers to rejigger the game, who was the
7-foot-1, 275-pound acme of basketball's majestic power, his most
frequent contact with the game in his retirement was as a spectator
at Los Angeles Clippers' contests, where he was a pal of the club's
vile owner, Donald Sterling.
</P>
<P>
   For all his imagery as an invincible titan, he was probably too
soft, fearful of his power to injure. Said longtime rival and
friend Bill Russell of Chamberlain's famous 1970 Finals showdown
with gimpy-legged Willis Reed, who led the Knicks to victory over
the Lakers partly because Chamberlain seemed to back off:
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm the one playing Willis when he comes out limping, it
would only have emphasized my goal to beat them that much worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the behemoth Lothario who claimed to have bedded 20,000
women died Tuesday at home in bed, alone, never married.
</P>
<P>
   A man bigger than nearly all men and nearly all description,
Chamberlain's contradictions make him that much richer a character,
and so much more than a great ballplayer.
</P>
<P>
   Yet his ballplaying greatness has somehow been warped, not only
with time but through the green filter of Russell, his nemesis,
rival and friend whose unmatched career seemed fated to compromise
the game's most powerful, agile giant.
</P>
<P>
   As the pair locked up in a goateed grind in the low post
throughout the 1960s, it was Russell's Celtics who almost always
were superior to Chamberlain's Warriors, 76ers and Lakers teams.
Watching the NBA evolve on fuzzy black-and-white TVs, it seemed
that every winter Sunday was incomplete without at least a few
minutes spent watching Russell barely outmaneuver his formidable
adversary.
</P>
<P>
   Sports theater was rarely better. To witness two such skilled,
intelligent, dramatic rivals directly pitted against each other for
most of a decade was a national privilege, made all the more rare
by sports' failure to produce its like again.
</P>
<P>
   Russell's teams won 11 championships in 13 years, and he was
recently selected Sports Illustrated's greatest team player of all
time. Chamberlain's Philadelphia team of 1966-67 and his Laker team
of 1971-72 won titles, but it was never enough, even though those
teams may have been the best in league history.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all judged by the championships we win,'' said forlorn
Laker president Jerry West Tuesday, talking about his former
teammate and fellow 40-year hoop icon. ``Unfortunately, he only won
two.''
</P>
<P>
   Only won two.
</P>
<P>
   Think about that. Consider how many NBA greats, particularly in
the Michael Jordan era, never won a single one. But Chamberlain
seems forever consigned to secondary status because his foil had so
many more.
</P>
<P>
   The heat of their battle long since faded to cold embers,
Russell articulated, during the NBA All-Star game in 1997 that
featured the selection of its 50 greatest players, the truth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody seems to appreciate what an incredible player Wilt
was,'' he said. ``He was the best player of all time because he
dominated the floor like nobody else ever could. To be that big and
athletic was special.''
</P>
<P>
   That may be blasphemous in the recently concluded era of Jordan.
Comparisons between eras are always murky, as well as comparisons
between different positions. But there is one fact that usually
escapes consideration in the argument.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA of Chamberlain's time had about 100 players. The NBA
when Jordan dominated swelled to more than 300, meaning he came up
against nowhere near the caliber of competition Chamberlain took on
every night. Whether it was Russell or Reed, or Nate Thurmond, Walt
Bellamy or Wes Unseld, Chamberlain almost always ran into a quality
foe.
</P>
<P>
   He crushed 'em all.
</P>
<P>
   Forget the freakish, 100-point game. Those 50-point, 28-rebound
games that he (begin italic) averaged (end italic) didn't come
against Jim McIlvaine or Greg Ostertag. While 30 years of gene-pool
splashings may have improved the caliber of the average NBA
athlete, 30 years of expansion have spread those athletes amuch more broadly.
</P>
<P>
   Chamberlain in his prime today would be even more dominant than
in his day, because of the flatness of the surrounding territory.
And owing to growth of the NBA's popularity and the increase in
media coverage, his blunt, sometimes reckless personality would be
even more immense.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine a Dennis Rodman with brains, sophistication and
multidimensional talent.
</P>
<P>
   In his 1983 biography ``Giant Steps,'' Kareem Abdul-Jabbar wrote
about his hero worship as a kid of Chamberlain, his brief playing
rivalry as their careers crossed in the early 1970s, and of his
later contempt for his personal politics.
</P>
<P>
   But the game's giants eventually patched things up. And although
the book is filled with Abdul-Jabbar's belief of his superiority
over Chamberlain, he knew that in psychological as well as physical
stature, there was no one in the public mind quite like
Chamberlain.
</P>
<P>
   Abdul-Jabbar wrote: ``In airplanes and subways, on movie lines
or in the street, all big black guys were asked not, `Are you Bill
Russell?' but `Are you Wilt?' ''
</P>
<P>
   In his greatness, his contradictions and his foibles,
Chamberlain was a magnificent American original _ outsized, all
ways.

SPORTS COLUMN: BERNIE WILLIAMS A SYMBOL OF THE RIVALRY
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It would have been entirely appropriate, if
completely out of character, for Bernie Williams to have taken a
moment before the first pitch of the latest Yankee-Red Sox hoedown
Wednesday night by doffing his cap and saluting Jimy Williams and
the entire Boston bench.
</P>
<P>
   Here's to you, your well-intentioned offer and your delusions of
luring an authentic Yankee center fielder to that charming little
dump you call home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have only the best things to say about the Red Sox
organization,'' Williams said before Game 1 of the American League
Championship Series. ``We had a very nice, productive
communication.''
</P>
<P>
   If ever there was one, this was a unilateral summation of what
had been a joint endeavor. Williams got $87.5 million. The Red Sox
wound up with a .240 hitter, Darren Lewis, in center field.
</P>
<P>
   Williams was talking about a sit-down with Jimy Williams, the
Red Sox manager, in Atlanta last November, which preceded a $91
million offer to the free-agent center fielder when the Yankees, at
the time, were asking him to survive on $30 million less.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, after the Yankees experienced a bout of temporary
insanity and unsuccessfully pursued Albert Belle, they upped the
ante for their placid, homegrown star, who was practically pleading
with them to not make him go.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as the rivalry and the fans, that would have been
something I would've had to deal with had I gone,'' Bernie Williams
said. ``But you start to think about playing for an organization,
how it works, and that makes it hard.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Williams knew the Yankees were truly the better fit,
the more fashionable locale. George Steinbrenner realized his
hard-line bluff was called. The Red Sox recognized they had lost to
the Yankees one more time.
</P>
<P>
   They have always been an American League afterthought, one
crucial little detail that too often gets overlooked when people
begin to rhapsodize Yankees-Red Sox as the best rivalry in sports.
The Los Angeles Lakers and the Boston Celtics in the 1980s, that
was a rivalry. The San Francisco 49ers and the Dallas Cowboys at
least took turns beating each other in important postseason games.
Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier battered each other silly. When
Martina Navratilova and Chris Evert played in the final of a Grand
Slam, you didn't sleep easily after betting the mortgage on the
outcome.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Russians won a couple of Olympic basketball gold medals
by directly beating the United States. When the World Series
tabulation in the last 81 years is Yankees 24, Red Sox 0, what we
are talking about is less a definitive rivalry and more a case of
one invading army occupying the territory of another.
</P>
<P>
   Passions run deep, even if the results are one-sided.
</P>
<P>
   ``You learn about the Yankees and the Red Sox the first time you
come in here,'' Bernie Williams said. ``I remember one year, I
think it was '93, we opened here against Boston and Roger Clemens
was their starter. It was amazing to see the fans, the
electricity.''
</P>
<P>
   Six years later, Clemens is emotionally unplugged from New
England, having defected to the Yankees, by way of Toronto. He
believed he had to put his money on the Yankees to finally get him
a championship ring.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys in here, they expect to win,'' Clemens said.
</P>
<P>
   After all these years, after all their disappointments, it would
surely be sweeter for Red Sox fans if they could somehow win at the
expense of Clemens. John Valentin is the only player left from when
Clemens was in Boston, but he's a friend. That is another angle
that gets distorted in the rush to create the event of the decade
every other month. This is not personal. It's all about uniforms
and history.
</P>
<P>
   Their overall pitching is typically shallow. Their payroll isn't
as large. But it would be a wonderful boost to the propagandists if
the Red Sox could finally beat the Yankees, deprive Clemens of a
World Series, and the Yankees of the chance to stamp the century
with their 25th World Series title.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees have much to lose, so the pressure's on them. If the
Red Sox can claw their way to Game 7, they would likely have Pedro
Martinez and the indisputable edge.
</P>
<P>
   They've had their feel-good years, the Red Sox have. Four World
Series since 1918. A couple of ACLS appearances in the late 1980s
when the Yankees were Cleveland, an All-Star lineup with a 10-cent
staff. But the World Series tally is what it is. The one-game
playoff in 1978 stands as a nine-inning synopsis of Boston's
endless pursuit of the Yankees, like the Road Runner cartoon.
</P>
<P>
   Now they finally meet in the postseason. It's time for the Red
Sox to stand up and win. The so-called best rivalry in sports can't
be a rout.

 &HT;    Remlinger rewarded with deal
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For the first time in his life, Mike Remlinger has
some long-term security.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves signed the 33-year-old reliever to a two-year
contract extension Wednesday worth $3.2 million with a club option
for a third year. It was the first multiyear deal for Remlinger, a
first-round draft pick by the Giants in 1987 who didn't spent his
first full season in the majors for another 10 years.
</P>

   Remlinger, traded to the Braves from the Reds last winter, along
with Bret Boone for Denny Neagle, Michael Tucker and Rob Bell, has
emerged as the Braves' primary left-handed reliever. He had a
career year, going 10-1 with a 2.37 ERA and appearing in 73 games.
His 10 wins were the most by a Braves reliever since Cecil Upshaw
had 11 in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   ``With everything I've been through, to be in a place I'd pick
over everywhere else, to get to stay here and to be financially
secure is great,'' Remlinger said. ``It's a great cap to what to
this point has been a great year.''
</P>
<P>
   Remlinger had a one-year deal for this season worth $1.1
million. With his new contract, he will make $1.4million in 2000
and $1.6million in 2001, with a club option worth $2million in 2002
with a $200,000 buyout.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike's done a remarkable job, as his statistics attest,''
Braves general manager John Schuerholz said. ``He's been an
important linchpin performer for our bullpen.''
</P>
<P>
   NOW PITCHING ...
</P>
<P>
   John Smoltz's excellent adventures continued with the first
relief appearance of his career.
</P>
<P>
   Just as nearly everything Smoltz has tried this season has come
out golden _ from a new arm angle to a knuckleball _ so did the
ninth inning. Smoltz retired the side to add his first career save
to his record of 12 postseason wins.
</P>
<P>
   Smoltz was greeted by a roar from the Turner Field crowd as he
jogged out of the bullpen in right-center field.
</P>
<P>
   Smoltz needed only 11 pitches, eight of which were strikes, to
retire the side. He finished by striking out Bobby Bonilla on a
fastball clocked at 97 mph.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to smile now,'' said Smoltz, who said he'll have no
problem being ready for his start in Game 4 Saturday. ``It gives me
a far greater appreciation for what those guys do.''
</P>
<P>
   LEARNING THE HARD WAY
</P>
<P>
   The Braves had discussed Kenny Rogers' capacity to pick off
runners at first base during a team meeting before the series. They
even listened to longtime American Leaguer Ozzie Guillen say not
only was Rogers' move good, it was great.
</P>
<P>
   But Gerald Williams and Andruw Jones got picked off first base _
neither was trying to steal on the plays _ in the first two innings
to spoil offensive opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, we learned to glue our feet to first base,'' Cox said.
``I told Gerald and the guys when you get up there, you're not
running, his move is good. It's borderline (to a balk), but we
weren't stealing.'' WEISS BACK IN
</P>
<P>
   Cox had originally planned to start Jose Hernandez in Game 2
against Rogers, but changed his mind after the night Walt Weiss had
in Game 1, going 3-for-4.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looked good at short and he swung the bat well ... so we're
going to go ahead and go with the hot hand right now,'' Cox said.
``It's not demeaning Hernandez in any way. It's a great situation
having two right-handers on the bench (along with Howard Battle)
instead of one.''

DALLAS FILM FEST MAKES INROADS FOR HISPANICS

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like a lot of micro-budget independent films, Bob's Video _ ``a
romantic comedy about a hostage situation in a video store'' _ is a
mixture of problems and promise. Although it's a bit ragged, it has
flashes of bright wit that have inspired comparisons with
``Clerks,'' and moments of stylistic dash that echo the raucous
work of the Coen brothers.
</P>
<P>
   It almost didn't get made, though, because director Dino Andrade
wanted to cast a Latino actor in a nonethnic role _ a decision that
ultimately cost him his financing. Eventually, he and his wife
maxed out four credit cards and put their business up as collateral
to get the movie made.
</P>
<P>
   ``It made a lot of distributors crazy,'' says Andrade, whose
movie will show this weekend at the Vistas Film Festival, Dallas'
first Hispanic-oriented film fest. ``I would say what I had to say,
and they'd look at me and nod, and then they'd say, `Do you think
Michael J. Fox could play Hispanic?' ''
</P>
<P>
   It's frustrations such as Andrade's that helped lead to Vistas,
an ambitious fest that opens Thursday (Oct. 14) on three screens at
the Medallion 5 theater in east Dallas. The festival has an
impressive lineup ranging from hard-to-find films by surrealistic
director Luis Bunuel to regional premieres of more than a
half-dozen movies. Some of the movies, such as ``Bob's Video,'' are
not ethnocentric; others speak specifically to Hispanic culture and
issues. In some way, however, all involve Latinos, either onscreen
or behind the scenes.
</P>
<P>
   Vistas is the latest in a growing number of Hispanic-oriented
festivals, including those in Corpus Christi, San Antonio, San
Francisco and New York. The fest was the brainchild of Frank P.
Hernandez, a Dallas lawyer and activist who is the founder of the
Herculano y Elida Hernandez Foundation, which is presenting the
festival. Hernandez enlisted Rita Meno, a 1998 graduate of Southern
Methodist University's film school, as the executive director for
the festival.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is this huge audience,'' Meno, 23, says of the Hispanic
population. ``And yes, they go see the blockbusters. But I think
that it's important that there's a place that can provide the films
that show reflections of themselves. And I don't even mean ... it
has to be about Hispanic culture, it has to be about Latinos, it
has to be about that. Just to see a Hispanic, regardless.''
</P>
<P>
   Often, though, seeing a Hispanic character in a movie means
seeing a stereotype. Even in successful Hispanic-themed movies such
as ``American Me, Stand and Deliver'' and ``Mi Familia,'' a
Hispanic actor was just as likely to play a gang member or maid as
to portray a positive role model. For every success story such as
Jimmy Smits, Jennifer Lopez or Salma Hayek, scores of actors
struggle against the typecasting mind-set. And just because a
character is Hispanic doesn't mean that a Hispanic will be cast in
the role.
</P>
<P>
   Andrade tells stories of having agents send him Italian and
Greek actors for ``Bob's Video'' when he specifically requested a
Mexican-American, or of having Latino hopefuls show up in gang
regalia because that's the kind of part they expected to play.
Besides Fox, distributors also suggested John Cusack for the role
of a timid video-store clerk _ an adopted young man who's unsure of
his heritage. Andrade eventually cast Mexican-American actor
Richard Coca, a veteran of such movies as ``The Truth About Cats
and Dogs'' and ``Lone Star,'' in the lead role.
</P>
<P>
   Similar casting woes led Evelina Fernandez, an actress who has
had parts in such movies as ``American Me,'' to write
``Luminarias,'' a romantic comedy about four Latinas and their
search for love. Unlike Andrade, who simply wants to see more
opportunities for Hispanic actors, Fernandez wants to make films
with Hispanic themes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think our film is maybe the first film that features four
professional Latina women in the lead roles,'' says Fernandez, who
also stars in ``Luminarias,'' which has played festivals in San
Francisco and Europe. ``We've been to so many different cities, and
it seems as though the Latino audience is just dying to see visions
of themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Meno _ who emphasizes that she is not Hispanic _ is
trying to remedy that with her programming, she hopes to attract
non-Latino audiences to the festival as well. Her mixture of
classics by Bunuel and Carlos Saura, '80s and '90s films such as
``The Milagro Beanfield War'' and ``American Me,'' and new material
should be of interest to any film fan. So should the festival's
half-dozen workshops, as well as the guest appearances by
filmmakers and actors, including Andrade, Fernandez and Coca (who
is in ``Luminarias'' as well as ``Bob's Video'').
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the new films are all in English,'' Meno says. ``Just
because it involves Hispanic people, and because it's about the
Hispanic culture, it doesn't have to be scary. It doesn't have to
be completely different and completely nonrelated to everything
else. I think they're all pretty mainstream, as far as the story
goes.''
</P>
<P>
   And although ``Bob's Video'' falls into that mainstream category
_ it's as influenced by the '60s slapstick comedies of Blake
Edwards as by the hipster shenanigans of the Coens _ Andrade's
biggest hope is that the fest will eventually lead distributors to
see the film through colorblind eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a possibility that we'll have a premiere at
CineVegas,'' he says, referring to Las Vegas' film festival,
scheduled for December. ``That kind of thing, to be recognized by a
nonethnic festival, happens because of festivals like Vistas.
That's one of the most important things _ to put us on the map.''

DALLAS FILM FEST MAKES INROADS FOR HISPANICS

<P>
   Like a lot of micro-budget independent films, Bob's Video _ ``a
romantic comedy about a hostage situation in a video store'' _ is a
mixture of problems and promise. Although it's a bit ragged, it has
flashes of bright wit that have inspired comparisons with
``Clerks,'' and moments of stylistic dash that echo the raucous
work of the Coen brothers.
</P>
<P>
   It almost didn't get made, though, because director Dino Andrade
wanted to cast a Latino actor in a nonethnic role _ a decision that
ultimately cost him his financing. Eventually, he and his wife
maxed out four credit cards and put their business up as collateral
to get the movie made.
</P>
<P>
   ``It made a lot of distributors crazy,'' says Andrade, whose
movie will show this weekend at the Vistas Film Festival, Dallas'
first Hispanic-oriented film fest. ``I would say what I had to say,
and they'd look at me and nod, and then they'd say, `Do you think

 By DAVID E. SANGER with SAM HOWE VERHOVEK    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   REDDISH KNOB, Va. _ President Clinton said Wednesday that he
would permanently protect at least 40 million acres of federal
forest land from road building, logging and mining, using
administrative actions meant to outmaneuver powerful opponents in
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Standing in front of a spectacular fall vista here on the edge
of the Shenandoah Valley _ and next to the grandson of Gifford
Pinchot, who mapped out the first protected forests under President
Theodore Roosevelt _ Clinton said, ``We're going to have a big
fight on this for about a year.''
</P>
<P>
   Later he said, ``In the end, we're going to protect all this
before it's too late.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the strategy described Wednesday by Clinton's top aides,
the Forest Service will speed through hearings and issue
regulations by the end of next year that will prevent any type of
development in the remote sections of national forests that have
never had roads, and in other underdeveloped areas of the 192
million acres the agency manages.
</P>
<P>
   They would include the North Fork of the American River in
California, the Pagoda Peak Roadless Area in Colorado, and the
South Quinault Ridge in Olympic National Forest in Washington. Most
of the newly set aside land would be in tracts of 5,000 acres or
more that are undeveloped, but not protected by formal wilderness
designation.
</P>
<P>
   The protection of so much land would be one of the most
significant conservation actions taken by the administration, which
has fought bitter battles over the use of public lands. The
directive Clinton issued Wednesday affects far more acreage, for
example, than the preservation of 1.7 million acres of the
mineral-rich Grand Staircase Escalante in Utah.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, which has been pressed by Vice President Al Gore and
Clinton's chief of staff, John Podesta, has been debated heatedly
since the administration first floated the idea early in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton went out of his way to credit Gore, who was in Los
Angeles, seeking an endorsement from the AFL-CIO. At one point,
Clinton referred to conservation efforts ``taken under the
administration of Vice President Gore _ and me.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's action was applauded by conservation groups, which
the White House had invited to this remote peak overlooking the
Little River Roadless Area, another of the forests that would be
protected under the new rules.
</P>
<P>
   But the action was denounced by the timber and paper industries
and legislators from states, mostly in the West, where logging in
the national forests is big business.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Ted Stevens, the Alaska Republican who chairs the Senate
Appropriations Committee, has opposed including the 17-million-acre
Tongass National Forest in the declaration. So have Sen. Frank H.
Murkowski and Rep. Don Young, both Alaska Republicans who chair the
House and Senate committees that oversee the Forest Service.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a grand slam,'' said Ken Rait, the director of the
Heritage Forests Campaign, a conservation group financed by the Pew
Charitable Trusts. ``Future presidents would have to go through the
same type of review process to undo this, and we think that's
politically impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   But other environmental groups were far more cautious in their
endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's simply premature to say that this is a great thing,''
said Carl Ross, executive director of Save America's Forests, a
coalition of environmental groups based in Washington, D.C. ``All
he's doing is setting in motion a study, which may or may not lead
to more protection in the end. It's preservation, with a big
asterisk, and maybe with loopholes.''
</P>
<P>
   Ross said the protections also fell short of those in a bill
sponsored by Sen. Robert Torricelli, the New Jersey Democrat, which
would essentially ban clear-cut logging on the nation's public
forests altogether.
</P>
<P>
   And the environmentalists were also concerned that Wednesday's
announcement left open the fate of the Tongass National Forest. It
is one of the world's largest remaining temperate old-growth rain
forests and has long been at the heart of a legal battle zone
pitting conservationists against logging companies, both seeing
immense value in the forest's vast stands of cedar, hemlock and
spruce.
</P>
<P>
   ``This could be one of the greatest environmental protection
measures in the country's history, but it has to include the
Tongass,'' said Matt Zencey, campaign manager for the Alaska
Rainforest Campaign, an environmental group. ``It is the largest
national forest, and it is the poster child for everything that
could be right or could be wrong with the country's forests.''
</P>
<P>
   But if environmentalists expressed some mixed feelings about
Clinton's announcement, logging industry representatives and many
Western Republicans were unshaking in their disdain for the whole
proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a tremendous state of frustration in our industry _ I
mean, who is going to argue with the idea of protecting national
forests?'' said W. Henson Moore, president of the American Forest &AMP;
Paper Association and a former congressman from Louisiana. ``You
can give a beautifully crafted speech, which President Clinton is
very good at doing, and make the American people feel very good
that we're going to stop these evil people from cutting trees down,
but that's not what's going on here at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore said the protections outlined by Clinton amounted to ``an
extremist form of preservation'' that could lead to the loss of
thousands of jobs and that would subject the forests to fire and
disease hazards.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main reason roads are built is to keep the forests
healthy,'' he said, ``to get out dead and dying trees that can
build a fuel load and cause a catastrophic fire, which happened on
5 million acres in the past year alone. Now the extreme
environmentalists will say, that's right, a forest burning down is
all a part of the natural cycle and that's OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Larry Craig, a Republican from Idaho, was equally caustic
in his criticism, and said Clinton was wrong to try to impose
unilaterally a decision that should have been up to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an attitude in this administration that not only does
King William want to reign, he appears at this moment to be setting
up a monarchy for Prince Albert,'' Craig told reporters Tuesday,
criticizing the president in advance of his public announcement.
``These are not the king's lands, these are the people's lands, and
we think he ought to come to the people's bodies to form and shape
this kind of policy.''
</P>
<P>
   The plan outlined by the president, however controversial, could
well amount to one of the most sweeping land-preservation measures
in the nation's history. Roosevelt added more t million
acres to the national forest system in his tenure, and the National
Park System, created under a single agency in 1916, started with
about 7 million acres and has grown over subsequent decades to
around 80 million acres in all.
</P>
<P>
   Under Forest Service rules, most national forests can be used
for logging and some types of mining, although much of the property
is not suitable for these uses. About 34 million acres of the
forests _ roughly 18 percent _ have been designated ``wilderness
areas'' by Congress, and are off limits for development.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton cannot expand wilderness areas without congressional
approval, which would be virtually impossible to obtain. So
instead, starting with a notification that is expected to be
published Thursday in the Federal Register, the White House is
creating a another class of Forest Service lands, only slightly
less protected than wilderness areas. That category of roadless
areas would restrict a wide variety of activities, chiefly the
construction of new roads. And without roads, it is extraordinarily
difficult to harvest timber.

SENATE VOTES DOWN NUCLEAR TEST BAN PACT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a blistering slap at President Clinton, the
Senate on Wednesday rejected a treaty banning nuclear weapons
testing worldwide. It refused to delay the vote even after an
11th-hour personal plea from the president.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats and the White House attributed the treaty defeat to
unbridled partisanship and personal animosity toward Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The 48-for, 51-against vote was historic both in its
implications for global nuclliferation and for its impact on
Clinton's presidency. The vote marked the first time since the
League of Nations was killed during the Woodrow Wilson
administration that a foreign policy treaty had been defeated on
the Senate floor.
</P>
<P>
   The failure to ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty also
robs Clinton of his hope, amid the scandals that have marred his
presidency, to earn a line in history as the president who ushered
in a new era of nuclear stability.
</P>
<P>
   In an extraordinary move, European heads of state had pleaded
with the Senate to ratify the treaty, noting that other nations
would follow the lead of the world's last superpower. Many world
leaders have voiced the concerned that some rogue regimes might
take a U.S. defeat of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty as a green
light to develop and test nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   But the Senate, after struggling and failing to find a graceful
way out of voting on the treaty, went ahead with a vote, falling
well short of the 67-count, two-thirds majority needed to ratify
the document.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a moment that will long be remembered for the failure
of the U.S. Senate to act responsibly,'' said Senator John F. Kerry
of Massachusetts. The Senate acted ``without even the veneer of
statesmanship. Politics and spite are what are directing this
vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Four Republicans, including Senator James M. Jeffords of
Vermont, sided with the Democratic minority; veteran Senator Robert
C. Byrd, Democrat of West Virginia, voted ``present.''
</P>
<P>
   In a late attempt to stop the vote, Clinton called the Senate
majority leader, Trent Lott of Mississippi, at 5:15 p.m. to ask
what could be done, said a Lott spokesman, John Czwartacki.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lott basically said, `Well, thank you, Mr. President, for
calling for the first time since this started, but we have a vote
in a few minutes,''' Czwartacki said of the conversation.
</P>
<P>
   The unsuccessful call demonstrated Clinton's diminishing
personal clout, and gave weight to complaints from both Republicans
and Democrats that the president had not spent enough time lobbying
for the treaty's ratification since he signed it at the United
Nations in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible, under parliamentary rules, Senate leaders said,
that the treaty could be reconsidered. But with support for the
treaty weak, a new vote is not expected soon.
</P>
<P>
   A disappointed Clinton called the rejection of the treaty
``reckless, and ultimately partisan,'' and said the United States
would continue to refrain from nuclear testing, treaty or no
treaty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I assure you, the fight is far from over'' to get the treaty
ratified, Clinton told reporters Wednesday night. ``We have to
press on and do the right thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican legislators, replying to the partisanship assertions,
insisted that they objected to the treaty on its merits. Some
senators say believe that any kind of arms control compromises the
U.S. ability to protect itself.
</P>
<P>
   Others said they were unconvinced that the compliance of other
signers could be verified.
</P>
<P>
   But the underlying issue, Democrats on Capitol Hill and in the
White House argued, had less to do with honest, philosophical
disagreement on arms control and more to do with a lingering,
post-impeachment bitterness toward Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never seen partisanship as bad as it is here now. It
started with impeachment, and it's gotten worse since,'' said
Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   There is ``a major disconnect between the White House and the
Congress,'' Leahy said. ``For some members, it's as though having
failed to convict the president, they want to convict him every day
on something else.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Republicans on Capitol Hill have shown astonishment and
anger at the president's repeated ability to bounce back from
adversity, be it a poor showing in a poll or an impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   It is that frustration and irritation, Democrats say, that has
led the Republicans in Congress to try to thwart Clinton at every
turn.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate, for instance, has refused to confirm many of
Clinton's judicial nominees.
</P>
<P>
   The test ban vote was especially embarassing for the President,
analysts say, because it makes him appear weak internationally, out
of control of foreign policy.

   ``The sad thing here is that Trent Lott's hatred of Bill Clinton
is stronger than his love of country,'' said Mark Mellman, a
Democratic pollster who is an unofficial adviser to Vice President
Al Gore's presidential campaign. ``I never thought I'd see this,
but that's the way it is.''
</P>
<P>
   The irritation with Clinton surfaced during Wednesday's debate.
Senator Jesse Helms, Republican of North Carolina, dismissed an
article written by the leaders of France, Britain and Germany
urging ratification of the treaty, suggesting that Clinton had
ordered it up from Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain, with whom
Clinton shares a strong relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Voicing an imaginary conversation between Clinton and Blair,
Helms said Blair might have responded to Clinton's alleged request
by saying, ``Yes, I can do that. And give my regards to Monica.''
</P>
<P>
   Senators spent much of the last week trying to find a way to
delay the vote, in negotiations that focused mainly on couching the
right rhetoric to give political cover to both Democrats and
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Neither side wanted to appear to have caved in, and the
Republicans were worried that a ``no'' vote on the treaty, which
polls said 80 percent of the American public supported, would hurt
them in their 2000 campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans had insisted on, and got, a formal request from
Clinton to delay the treaty vote. They had demanded a promise that
the Democrats would not bring the treaty up again for the remainder
of Clinton's term, a condition Lott refused to give absolutely,
arguing that international events might warrant a reconsideration.
</P>
<P>
   The demand was meaningless, since it is the Republican Senate
leadership, not the Senate Democrats or the White House _ that
schedules items for votes.

 &HT;    Independent brokers making big gains
 &HT;    By Jim Dillon
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CENTERVILLE, Ohio _ Dwayne Adams, Bob Gossett and Cory Crozier
share more than adjoining office space at 7990 Clyo Road. They
share careers as independent securities brokers.
</P>
<P>
   Adams, who runs the Adams Financial Group, and Gossett and
Crozier, who run a separate firm that bears their names, are among
the thousands of securities dealers nationwide who have left major
brokerage houses in recent years to start their own businesses as
so-called ``independents.''
</P>
<P>
   As of 1998, there were 96,000 independents nationwide. That
constituted about 20 percent of all financial intermediaries in the
country, according to Edwin Barkel, senior vice president for Sky
Investments, a division of the Sky Financial Group based in Bowling
Green, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1992 and 1997, the number of independents grew at a rate
of 23 percent annually, Barkel said. That rate has dropped to about
20 percent as the ``Merrill Lynches and Smith Barneys of the world
realized they were losing good, quality producers. They have
changed some strategies'' to retain good brokers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Adams Financial and Gossett and Crozier sell securities offered
by Sky Investments. About 80 percent of Sky Investments' sales are
made through independents, said Sky Investments President and Chief
Executive Robert Gioia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We pride ourselves on products that vary from insurance to
financial planning to fee-based accounts,'' Gioia said. ``We offer
everything because we truly are a conduit for a broker to do
business.''
</P>
<P>
   Independents must adhere to the same rules and regulations
issued by the National Association of Securities Dealers and the
Securities and Exchange Commission as their brokerage house
counterparts. But independents say they are freer to offer a wider
variety of products and services to their clients because they are
not locked into offering only what their employer wants them to
sell.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not representing any one company or product,'' said Adams,
who started working with Sky Investments about three years ago. ``I
can sit next to my client and look at all of the products available
and make a recommendation on what best fits his needs. That's how I
explain it to prospective clients, and most of them really like the
idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Adams said he has about 200 clients. Gossett said he and Crozier
have about 150 clients. Like Adams, they focus largely on financial
planning, mutual funds and annuities.
</P>
<P>
   Gossett said he much prefers being an independent.
</P>
<P>
   ``After running your own business, it's hard to imagine going to
work for somebody else again,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gioia said his ultimate goal is to sign up 400 independent
brokers in Sky Investments' 20-state sales territory.
</P>
<P>
   Prospective brokers go through a series of background checks
that include reviews of their credit and regulatory records.
</P>

 &HT;    NAACP leader urges progress in education
 &HT;    By Scott Elliott
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ NAACP President Kweisi Mfume rallied urban
educators from around the country in a speech in Dayton on
Wednesday, telling them to keep faith in their struggle to improve
the lives of children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of you think what you do goes unnoticed by others,'' he
said. ``That is not the case at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Mfume spoke at a kick-off reception at the Crown Plaza Hotel for
the annual convention of the Council of the Great City Schools, an
organization that represents the 58 largest urban school districts
in the United States. More than 500 educational leaders are
expected to attend the five-day convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Real andawesome challenges face all of us,'' Mfume said.
``It's not a matter of having come a long way, but of having a
long, long way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   The disparity between the high level of spending per student in
the wealthiest suburban public schools and the low level in the
poorest urban public schools in the U.S. is ``immoral,'' Mfume
said.
</P>
<P>
   He assailed voucher programs that use public dollars to pay for
children to attend private schools, saying they benefit only a few
poor children while taking money from public schools that must
educate the disadvantaged students left behind.
</P>
<P>
   `not want to leave any child behind,'' Mfume said.
``Vouchers leave 98 percent of them behind.''
</P>
<P>
   Congress has enacted a ``reverse Robin Hood'' economic plan, he
said, so that ``the haves have more and the have-nots have nothing
at all,'' and race still is an issue in the U.S. and in education.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue of skin color dominates too many aspects of American
life,'' Mfume said.
</P>
<P>
   The convention continues today and includes a luncheon speech by
civil rights leader the Rev. Jesse Jackson. Speeches and programs
are open only to those registered to attend the convention.

SENATE FARM BILL LEAVES OUT NEW ENGLAND DAIRY COMPACT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ New England farmers suffered two costly defeats
Wednesday, as the Senate passed a $69 billion farm bill that the
region's senators say shortchanges the region's dairy and crop
producers.
</P>
<P>
   The farm bill, which passed the Senate 74-26 and has already
been approved by the House, did not reauthorize a regional dairy
compact that had guaranteed farmers in the New England states a
base price for milk above that set by the US government. The bill
also shuts out the region from the bulk of disaster relief funds.
</P>
<P>
   All New England senators voted against the Agriculture
Appropriations bill except for Massachusetts Democrats Edward M.
Kennedy and John F. Kerry.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy and Kerry favored the package because they were able to
tack on a provision giving $15 million to New England fishermen,
aides to the senators said. The $15 million in research grants is
meant to alleviate the losses fishermen incurred from conservation
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The Northeast Dairy Compact, which has brought $75 million to
the region's dairy farmers since it was set in place in 1996, was
designed to pNew England's dairy farmers _ who are at a
climatic disadvantage to their counterparts in the Midwest _ from
fluctuations in milk prices.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the compact say it artificially inflates dairy
prices. But Kenneth Becker, executive director of the compact,
based in Montpelier, Vt., said the system has provided ``a safety
net for farmers.'' Now the region's dairy farmers may face
increased competition from Wisconsin and other states, and lower
prices for their products, New England lawmakers said.
</P>
<P>
   If raw market forces push Northeastern dairy producers out of
business, Becker and other supporters of the compact said,
consumers in the region might not have enough milk. Since dairy
products are perishable, farmers cannot store them in time of
excess, nor move them across the country in time to fill shortages.
</P>
<P>
   The farm bill also shortchanges the Northeast of federal aid for
farmers hit by this summer's drought, the area's lawmakers
complained.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never considered votes for people'' struck by disasters ``a
regional vote,'' said Senator Christopher Dodd, Democrat of
Connecticut. ``I'm just disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   The dairy industry in the Northeast ``gets a double-hit,''
because it loses out on both the dairy compact and on disaster aid,
Dodd said. ``It's grossly unfair.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton is expected to sign the bill.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate fight over the agriculture bill was sharply divided
along regional lines, with Midwestern senators, whose states tend
to benefit more from the $8.7 billion in disaster relief,
squelching the cries of Northeastern lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   The way the relief portion of the bill is structured, New
England will have no shot at all at $5.5 billion of the disaster
relief pool, and will only be able to compete with dozens of other
states for $1.2 billion in aid to cover losses from the drought,
the New England senators said.
</P>
<P>
   New England governors estimate that the need in their region
alone is $1.5 billion to $2 billion. Senate Minority Leader Thomas
Daschle, Democrat of South Dakota, said he would try to get an
additional $1 billion for disaster relief later in the year.
</P>
<P>
   The fate of the dairy compact is unclear. Both the dairy compact
and analysts like the Massachusetts Public Interest Research Group
say the system has not substantially raised milk prices, because
farmers are able to do better financial planning with the price
supports.
</P>
<P>
   But companies that buy dairy products to produce other foods
called the compact a ``price-fixing cartel'' that costs both milk
drinkers and food companies money.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't need a dairy farm in every backyard in New England,''
said Kathleen Nelson, spokeswoman for the International Dairy Foods
Association. ``New England has way more milk than it needs.''
</P>
<P>
   Midwestern farmers, Nelson said, should not be punished because
New England cannot produce milk as ``efficiently.''
</P>
<P>
   Milk prices have been propped up by the federal government for
60 years on the theory that milk producers have extraordinary risks
_ such as weather, natural disasters, and the short shelf-life of
dairy products.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration decided it was time to bring a more
market-oriented approach to dairy farming, and ordered an overhaul
of the price-support program.
</P>
<P>
   The 26-member Northeast Dairy Compact has had a brief reprieve
from dissolution as supporters and opponents of the new Clinton
policy battle in court over the overall dairy policy. But Becker
said that when the fight over the Clinton agriculture policy is
resolved, the compact _ whose authorization has expired _ will die
unless Congress acts.

ANALYSIS: THE MOST SIGNIFICANT TREATY REJECTION SINCE VERSAILLES 
</HEADLINE>
  (With TEST-BAN-TREATY) 
(bl) 
 By R.W. APPLE Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate's decisive rejection of the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty on Wednesday night was the most
explicit U.S. repudiation of a major international agreement in
almost 80 years, and it further weakened the already shaky standing
of the United States as a global moral leader.
</P>
<P>
   Not since the Versailles Treaty was voted down in November 1919,
an action that was repeated in March 1920, has so far-reaching an
accord been turned down. In the entire history of the Republic, the
Senate has rejected only 20 treaties negotiated by U.S. presidents
or other officials, while it has approved 1,523.
</P>
<P>
   By torpedoing a face-saving compromise that had been tentatively
agreed upon by the White House and the Republican leadership,
conservative Republicans made a vote inevitable. And by denying the
treaty not only the requisite two-third majority but even a simple
majority, the conservatives and their allies made good on a promise
by Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., to give the agreement a Capitol Hill
``funeral.''
</P>
<P>
   The control of nuclear weapons, perfected in the final days of
World War II, has been a central goal of U.S. foreign policy since
President Dwight D. Eisenhower proposed a ban on all nuclear
testing in 1958. All eight presidents in the four decades since _
Republicans and Democrats, liberals and conservatives _ have sought
in some way to limit testing and weapons development.
</P>
<P>
   In rejecting the test ban treaty, which President Clinton signed
on Sept. 24, 1996, at a ceremony at the United Nations, the Senate
halted the momentum built up over the years. No modern arms-control
treaty had ever been rejected, although President Jimmy Carter, who
had a hard time winning passage of the Panama Canal treaties,
withdrew the SALT II agreement with the Soviet Union from
consideration after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in late
1979.
</P>
<P>
   The SALT agreement was finally ratified in 1996, when memories
of Afghanistan had faded, but the Russian Duma has never acted upon
it.
</P>
<P>
   The treaty rejected Wednesday night was to have been the
capstone of arms-control efforts, banning even nuclear tests
conducted underground.
</P>
<P>
   Only last week, an international conference in Vienna urged the
United States, Russia and China, all of which had signed the global
agreement without formally ratifying it, to accelerate approval as
a means of bringing renewed pressure on North Korea, India and
Pakistan. They are the only three of the world's 44 nuclear-capable
nations that have not signed the pact.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday of this week, a spokesman for the Chinese foreign
ministry urged U.S. ratification, arguing that it would ``serve as
an example and promote the ratification of the treaty by other
countries.''
</P>
<P>
   North Korea has not stated its intentions clearly. India and
Pakistan have said they would ultimately sign, although the
military coup in Pakistan this week has raised doubts.
</P>
<P>
   The 15 nations that have signed but not ratified the accord now
have far less incentive to ratify. In addition to Russia and China,
Egypt and Israel are on that list. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright said in a speech in Maine on Wednesday that the United
States would continue to observe the terms of the treaty,
conducting no nuclear testing, and urge other nations to do the
same.
</P>
<P>
   But the whole point of the treaty was to make such undertakings
legally binding, not voluntary, and that now seems unachievable.
Ratification by all 44 countries is required for the agreement to
take effect.
</P>
<P>
   So the United States finds itself in the position of the
spoiler, at a time when it is already stigmatized as a nation that
refuses to pay its dues to the United Nations and, in some
quarters, as a nation that takes part in international
peace-keeping and other such efforts only reluctantly, only in some
parts of the world and only when its own ox is being gored.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For Clinton, whose influence abroad is waning, perhaps more than
that of the typical president approaching his final year in office,
the treaty's rejection was the latest in a series of difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   It took place against a backdrop of intense partisan and
ideological polarization between the White House and Congress,
which Clinton was unable to neutralize with the finesse he often
displays on domestic issues. Such polarization also played a key
role in the defeat of the Versailles Treaty, which came after t the
end of World War I, the most popular war the United States had ever
fought up to then.
</P>
<P>
   President Woodrow Wilson, a Democrat, invited neither Republican
leaders nor important senators to Paris for the peace talks,
telling associates that the Republicans, who had taken control of
both houses of Congress in the 1918 elections, would never dare to
refuse ratification. Compounding his error, Wilson refused to
compromise with Sen. Henry Cabot Lodge, R-Mass., chairman of the
Foreign Relations Committee and leader of the opposition to the
Versailles Treaty and the League of Nations, which was set up by a
covenant within the treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Lodge and many other Republicans intensely disliked Wilson, and
that contributed to the defeat, just as the enmity of Helms, the
current chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, and others
towards Clinton contributed to the rejection of the test ban
treaty. But in 1919 and 1920, unlike today, there was a passionate,
detailed debate about the treaty on both sides of the Atlantic,
with leading thinkers joining in attacks on the treaty.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the great British economist John Maynard Keynes
condemned Wilson as ``a blind and deaf Don Quixote'' who had been
``bamboozled'' by the more sophisticated Europeans. But the debate
on the test ban treaty has been brief and muted, with opponents
relying on generalized assertions that the accord would harm U.S.
national security by unwisely limiting sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   Because it never joined the League of Nations, the United States
was unable to play a role in the League's attempts to head off the
approach of World War II in places like Ethiopia, then called
Abyssinia, and that inevitably weakened the League's peace efforts.
</P>
<P>
   After the defeat of the Versailles Treaty and before Wednesday,
only five other treaty agreements had been rejected by the Senate.
U.S. adherence to the World Court, an arm of the League of Nations,
was one of the most important of the issues involved; it was turned
aside in January 1935, with 20 Democrats forsaking President
Franklin D. Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
   Described as a historic setback at the time, it proved to be
much less than that, as the influence of the World Court crumbled
in Europe's rush towards war. U.S. adherence would have made little
difference.
</P>
<P>
   The St. Lawrence Seaway project was blocked a year earlier, but
it was of course built after World War II. A commercial rights
treaty with Turkey was voted down in 1927. More recently, a
protocol of the Law of the Sea treaty regarding the compulsory
settlement of disputes was rejected (though not the treaty itself),
as was an obscure Montreal aviation protocol.
</P>
<P>
   But none of those actions had anything approaching the gravity
of Wednesday night's rejection, which went to the very heart of thes by the victorious allies to build a safer world in the wake
of World War II.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate on Wednesday rejected a treaty banning
all underground nuclear testing in a 48-51 vote that crushed one of
President Clinton's major foreign policy goals.
</P>
<P>
   The vote on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, largely along
party lines, failed to gain a simple majority, let alone the
two-thirds vote needed for ratification. It followed a weeklong
power play among Senate Republicans, Democrats and the White House
over a proposal to forestall the defeat of the treaty by delaying
action until after President Clinton left office.
</P>
<P>
   In a last-ditch effort to save the treaty, Clinton called the
Republican leader, Trent Lott, two hours before the vote and asked
that he delay action for national security reasons. In a blunt
rebuff, Lott said the president had offered too little, too late,
and he pushed ahead with an action that he knew would humiliate
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   This was the first time the Senate had defeated a major
international security pact since the Treaty of Versailles,
creating the League of Nations, failed to win Senate approval in
1920. While the Senate and White House often joust on legislation
governing domestic issues, senators of both parties usually defer
to the president in matters of national security.
</P>
<P>
   After the vote, Clinton, speaking on the White House lawn,
denounced the rejection by the Senate as a ``reckless'' and
``partisan'' act, and said that he would continue to pursue a ban
on testing. ``I assure you the fight is far from over,'' he said.
``When all is said and done, the United States will ratify the
treaty.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No constitutional obligation has been treated so cavalierly,
so casually, as this treaty,'' said Sen. Tom Daschle, the
Democratic leader.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The failure of the treaty to clear the Senate raised serious
questions about its survival. Supporters in Washington and abroad
had contended that if it was not adopted by the United States,
other nations with nuclear capability, ranging from Pakistan and
India to Russia and China, would follow suit, denying the 1996
treaty the 44 ratifications it needs to go into force. The leaders
of Britain, France and Germany had urged the Senate to postpone the
vote.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters said the treaty's demise dealt the United States a
diplomatic embarrassment that sends a perilous signal to nations
with emerging nuclear programs, like Pakistan and India, that more
testing is acceptable. ``This is a significant step backward in the
effort to stop the spread of nuclear weapons,'' said Sen. Byron
Dorgan, D-N.D.
</P>
<P>
   But to its critics, the ban would freeze an accord-abiding
United States dangerously in place while states like North Korea
and Iran, or even China and Russia, cheated and conducted
clandestine tests that eroded America's nuclear deterrent. ``This
won't make any difference to countries who are determined to be
part of the nuclear club,'' said Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., who is
a staunch arms control advocate.
</P>
<P>
   After the vote, Lott declared that the Senate and the president
were ``coequal partners'' in the treaty-making process. ``The fact
that the Senate has rejected several significant treaties this
century underscores the important quality control function that was
intended by the framers of the Constitution,'' he said. ``The
Founding Fathers never envisioned that the Senate would be a rubber
stamp for a flawed treaty.''
</P>
<P>
   Treaty supporters vowed to bring it up again, although Senate
and administration aides said that was unlikely this year or next.
In a telephone interview, the president's national security
adviser, Sandy Berger, said, ``Our job now is to reassure the world
that the United States continues to ascribe to the principles in
the treaty and the testing moratorium.''
</P>
<P>
   The treaty was signed by the United States in 1996 and sent to
the Senate a year later. So6 of the 44 nations considered to
have nuclear capability have approved the pact, including Britain,
France and Japan. But Russia and China have yet to ratify it,
signaling that they would take their lead from the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The United States imposed a moratorium on underground nuclear
tests in 1992, complementing a treaty banning atmospheric tests
adopted in 1963. To maintain the safety and reliability of the
aging arsenal now, the government employs a $4.5 billion annual
program of sophisticated computer models and non-nuclear explosive
tests.
</P>
<P>
   For the last two years, the treaty had been stalled in the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee, whose chairman, Jesse Helms,
R-N.C., was locked in a fight with the administration over two
other treaties that he wanted to kill before taking up the test
ban.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But when Senate Democrats threatened to tie up the Senate floor
unless Republicans held hearings and a vote on the treaty, Lott
abruptly called their bluff and scheduled a vote. Very quickly, it
became clear that supporters did not have the votes to pass the
pact.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, Clinton and Senate Democrats focused all their
efforts on getting Lott to pull the treaty from the Senate
calendar. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, Defense Secretary
William Cohen and Gen. Henry Shelton, the chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, all urged the Senate to delay action on the vote
for national security reasons.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton refused to meet Republicans' demand that he give an
ironclad promise not to bring up the treaty for the rest of his
presidency. He said this would jeopardize his administration's
efforts to curb the spread of nuclear arms.
</P>
<P>
   Senators said on Wednesday that the high-stakes brinkmanship
forced Lott and Daschle into inescapable procedural corners. On
Tuesday night, the two leaders reached a tentative deal to postpone
any floor action on the treaty until the next Congress took office
in 2001. Committees would hold hearings on the accord.
</P>
<P>
   Daschle agreed to those terms except in ``extraordinary
circumstances,'' as defined by the two leaders, effectively giving
Lott veto power over when the treaty could be brought up.
</P>
<P>
   But Republican hard-liners, including Helms, Jon Kyl of Arizona
and Paul Coverdell of Georgia, objected, contending that Democrats
could use that ``loophole,'' in Kyl's words, against Republicans as
a campaign issue next year.
</P>
<P>
   With that, the talks collapsed and the two leaders hardened
their stances on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made a run at it yesterday, but we just couldn't get
there,'' Lott said before the vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've put my best offer forward, and we're prepared to have the
vote,'' Daschle told reporters on Wednesday morning. ``We expect
that this should be and will be a national issue next year.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the decision to go forward with the treaty rested
squarely with Lott, who, as majority leader, controls the Senate
calendar.
</P>
<P>
   To bring the treaty to a vote on Wednesday, Lott first moved the
Senate from its regular legislative business to what is called the
executive calendar, where treaties and nominations are placed. This
procedural move requires a simple majority vote.
</P>
<P>
   Such votes are typically tests of party loyalty, and Wednesday
was no different. Senators voted 55 to 45 in a partisan vote to
move to the executive calendar.
</P>
<P>
   If Lott had not made such a motion, the treaty would have been
bottled up indefinitely and effectively killed. Even so, Lott had
the power to free individual Republicans who opposed the treaty but
sought to delay action on it to vote against him without
repercussions.
</P>
<P>
   At least one Republican, Gordon H. Smith of Oregon, who
supported postponing action, said he would have voted against the
procedural motion if Lott had given his blessing. But Lott said in
the hallway interview that he refused to grant any such privileges.
</P>
<P>
   A letter urging Mr. Lott and Daschle to postpone a vote on the
treaty ultimately gained 62 signatures, including those of 24
Republicans. But all those Republicans put a higher priority on
supporting their leader.
</P>
<P>
   The party line vote largely extended to the the treaty itself.
Only four Republicans _ Smith of Oregon, Arlen Specter of
Pennsylvania, James Jeffords of Vermont and John Chafee of Rhode
Island _ joined 44 Democrats in favor of the pact. Sen. Robert
Byrd, a West Virginia Democrat, voted present.

ON BASEBALL: VALENTINE FINESSED AND FLUMMOXED BY COX 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Think of it. The manager who gets no credit for his
team's eight consecutive division championships has outmanaged,
outmaneuvered, outfoxed the self-proclaimed smartest manager in
baseball. It's Bobby Cox 2, Bobby Valentine 0, and counting. Two
more games like the two here, and the Mets will be counted out.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets lost the second game of the National League
Championship Series Wednesday because Brian Jordan and Eddie Perez
clouted two-run home runs for the Braves in the space of five Kenny
Rogers pitches. Rogers, Valentine freely admitted afterward, should
not have been allowed to throw the fifth pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no reason to keep him in,'' Valentine said when asked
about the sixth-inning meltdown. ``I left him in, and it was
absolutely the wrong move.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes Valentine makes comments because he thinks that's what
his listeners want to hear, not necessarily because he means them.
So he was asked a few minutes later why he kept Rogers in to pitch
to Perez after Andruw Jones followed Jordan's game-tying home run
with a single.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just what I said,'' he responded. ``I had no reason for that.
It was just not the right move to do. It was just the wrong
decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Why was it the wrong decision?
</P>
<P>
   ``Because the guy hit a home run, and we got down by two.''
</P>
<P>
   But the failure to remove Rogers at what turned out to be a
critical juncture of the game was unprovoked by anything Cox did or
did not do. Just as he did the night before in Game 1, the Braves'
manager conned Valentine into making a pinch-hitting move that
would backfire. The Game 1 incident was not as meaty as
Wednesday's, but it worked for the Braves and against the Mets
nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   In Game 1, Greg Maddux went to the mound to warm up for the
eighth inning, the Braves ahead, 3-1. Dennis Cook, the Mets' relief
pitcher, was scheduled to be the first batter in the inning, but
Valentine sent up Matt Franco, his premier pinch-hitter, to bat for
him. Sorry, Bobby, bad move.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as the left-handed-hitting Franco was announced as being
in the game, Cox went to the mound and summoned a left-handed
pitcher, Mike Remlinger, from the bullpen. Gotcha. Valentine had
just wasted his best pinch-hitter. ``He fell for it,'' a member of
the Braves' staff chortled. Playing the right-left game, Valentine
had Melvin Mora, a right-handed hitter, bat instead of Franco.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was done; I had stiffened up a little bit,'' Maddux said
later. ``We were just trying to get Franco out of the game. I
wasn't going to make a pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   Fast forward to the ninth inning of Wednesday's game. John
Rocker, the Braves' closer whom the Mets can't hit, had relieved in
the eighth inning after securing the last four outs of the first
game and, with a runner at second base, maintained the one-run lead
by striking out John Olerud and Robin Ventura. When the Braves ran
onto the field for the ninth inning, the left-handed Rocker went
with them, taking his place on the mound.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine reacted accordingly, telling the right-handed hitting
Shawon Dunston to bat for the left-handed Darryl Hamilton. But as
soon as Dunston was officially in the game, Rocker was out. The
right-handed John Smoltz entered, and Dunston was left to face him.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Bonilla, who would face Smoltz later in the inning, used
the word brilliant in discussing Cox's decision to use Smoltz in
the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Cox, who has taken teams to more postseasons than any other
manager in baseball history, declined to take credit for outfoxing
his foe. He acknowledged that he had no intention to have Maddux
and Rocker pitch any longer, but he said of Valentine, ``He doesn't
know that. What was he going to do? I've had to do the same thing
before.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was not Cox who said in a recent magazine interview: ``I
don't need my competition to like me. But a lot of them just
absolutely fear that someday they're going to have to be on a panel
with me or something, and they'll just be exposed. That's a bad
statement. I know that. But I think it's absolutely true.''
</P>
<P>
   The Franco and Dunston moves weren't the only ones that
backfired for the Mets' Bobby.
</P>
<P>
   In the ninth inning of Game 1, the Mets, down a run, had a
runner at first, two out and Rey Ordonez the next hitter. Valentine
let Ordonez, the weakest hitter in the starting lineup, bat while
he had Benny Agbayani in the on-deck circle to bat for Turk
Wendell. Agbayani might not have had much of a chance against
Rocker, but maybe he would have gotten lucky and tied the game with
a home run. Such a possibility did not exist with Ordonez.
</P>
<P>
   But Valentine regretted that he had had Bonilla bat for Ordonez
with the bases loaded in a game here three weeks ago _ Bonilla
struck out _ and apparently had resolved not to make that move
again.
</P>
<P>
   Asked before the game Wednesday if there might be a time he
would hit for Ordonez, Valentine said: ``I don't think so. I don't
have a reason to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, he added: ``He's giving really good at-bats. That was the
best at-bat we had all day yesterday.''
</P>
<P>
   He meant the one against Rocker when Ordonez fouled off a
succession of pitches before grounding out sharply. But with two
out in the ninth inning Wednesday, Valentine did hit for Ordonez,
calling on Bonilla again. Again Bonilla struck out.
</P>
<P>
   At least the bunt that Ordonez foolishly tried in the second
inning wasn't Valentine's doing. With one run in, runners at first
and third and no one out, Ordonez pushed a bunt toward first base,
and Brian Hunter caught it in the air. The shortstop had bunted on
his own, the manager said. ``I was surprised by it,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The part of the baseball world that listens to Valentine is
undoubtedly surprised at the turn of managerial events in this
series.

INSURER TO PAY W.R. GRACE $3.7 MILLION FOR DISPUTED PAYOUTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Md., Maine)   (af)  
 By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   W.R. Grace &AMP; Co. said Wednesday that it would recover $3.7
million from an insurance company for excess payments and benefits
that were paid to two former chief executives, who themselves
disagreed over the disclosure of such payments.
</P>
<P>
   Charles P. Valdes, chairman of the investment committee of the
California Public Employees' Retirement System, or Calpers, said
the recovery was a victory for Grace shareholders like Calpers,
which owned 1.4 percent of Grace and which joined in lawsuits over
the payments in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``This settlement serves as a reminder to all corporations that
share owners won't stand by and let their interests be taken for
granted and their capital wasted,'' Valdes said.
</P>
<P>
   The case involved benefits that J. Peter Grace negotiated when
he retired at the end of 1992 after running the company for 48
years. The benefits, which included nursing care, continued use of
a company jet and other perquisites, were not disclosed to
shareholders at the time.
</P>
<P>
   After J.P. Bolduc succeeded Grace as chief executive, he learned
of those and other payments and wanted to disclose them to
shareholders, his lawyer, Gerald Walpin, said.
</P>
<P>
   That prompted an ugly battle between the two men that resulted
in Bolduc's abrupt resignation in March 1995. The resignation
stunned large investors who believed that Bolduc had been reviving
the company by shedding losing operations and focusing on a new
strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Soon it came out that five women had accused Bolduc of sexually
harassing them, accusations that Grace used as a cudgel to force
Bolduc to resign.
</P>
<P>
   At least four lawsuits were filed in New York Supreme Court
against Grace directors, contending that they improperly allowed
more than $11 million in payments to Grace, who died in April 1995,
and $20 million to Bolduc. The insurance company, Corporate
Officers and Directors Assurance, known as Coda, will now pay
within 30 days the $3.7 million to settle the litigation against
the Grace directors.
</P>
<P>
   Bolduc denied the harassment accusations, and the one lawsuit
brought against him was withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
   However, a nonprofit organization that Grace organized to expose
government waste did pay $400,000 to settle a claim by one woman
who said that she had been retaliated against after she made her
harassment claim against Bolduc, lawyers for Calpers and Bolduc
said.
</P>
<P>
   Walpin said no payments had been made to anyone based on
misconduct by his client.
</P>
<P>
   Bolduc, who now runs a rope company in Maine and Maryland,
objected to any payment to settle complaints that $5 million of his
severance was improper, Walpin said.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for the Grace estate did not respond to a request for
an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Grace, now a speciality chemicals company in Maryland, has an
entirely new team of directors and executives, said Bill Corcoran,
a spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the settlement is fair,'' Corcoran said. ``Since we
do have a new group of directors and a new management group, we
want to get all legacy litigation behind us.''

 &HT;    Report critical of Dell customer service
 &HT;    By Jerry Mahoney
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ In a surprising turnabout for a company that
consistently garners awards for customer service, Dell Computer
Corp. has been placed on a ``watch list'' for alleged
customer-service failings by a company that advises corporate and
government clients about their computer purchases.
</P>
<P>
   A report by Giga Information Group cites seven customers,
ranging from an author to a large Atlanta mortgage lender, who
complained of problems and poor customer service.
</P>
<P>
   The six-page report follows a sharply critical one-page
``Alert'' from Giga on Sept. 27 that accused Dell of shipping wrong
equipment, missing promised delivery dates, failing to fulfill
terms of agreements and ``arrogant disregard'' for customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because the problems largely appear to be new accounts, this
does not reflect a broad quality problem with Dell,'' wrote Giga
Vice President Rob Enderle on Sept. 27. ``But (it) does reflect a
risk for accounts that are choosing to move to Dell from another
vendor _ a move that we believe is unreasonable.''
</P>
<P>
   In both reports, Enderle claims that Dell employees are covering
up mistakes, which is a pattern he said he saw previously in
fast-growing companies such as Apple Computer Inc., Microsoft Corp.
and Netscape Communications Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Enderle, a 26-year veteran of the industry, also has been
critical of other computer makers. Earlier this year, he put
Houston-based Compaq Computer Corp. on a watch after Chief
Executive Eckhard Pfeiffer was fired. Compaq has since been removed
from the watch.
</P>
<P>
   Dell executives readily acknowledge problems with some orders,
noting that mistakes are inevitable for a company that is expected
to ship 12 million PCs this year. But the company disputes
Enderle's assertion that employees routinely conceal
customer-service problems from senior management.
</P>
<P>
   ``To think that customer-support issues do not get raised to
senior executive level is ... ridiculous,'' Dell spokesman David
Frink said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Frink said Dell officials will meet with Giga, a 4-year-old
Cambridge, Mass., company with more than 1,000 clients in business
and government.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just can't reiterate enough that we are continuing to talk
to Giga to resolve these customer issues,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The reports are surprising in light of Dell's reputation for
being sharply focused on customer service. Last year, Fortune
magazine's Technology Buyer's Guide gave Dell its ``Readers'
Choice'' award for overall service and reliability. Another
publication, PC Magazine, named Dell its ``Readers' Choice'' winner
for service and reliability for desktops and notebooks.
</P>
<P>
   Other industry research companies said they have not noticed
recent customer-service problems at Dell. Nonetheless, complaints
about Dell _ or any computer maker _ aren't hard to find.
</P>
<P>
   Geri Roberts, a 62-year-old Austin resident, said she tried
recently to buy a Dell Dimension with the help of her sister in
West Virginia, who planned to charge the machine on her credit
card. Excited to learn Web page design as a source of income,
Roberts tried to order a custom-built machine on the phone with a
Dell saleswoman. But for the next several days, Roberts and her
sister were unable to reach salespeople at Dell to complete the
purchase. Frustrated, they bought a PC from Micron Electronics
Inc., Roberts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still think that somewhere along the line they (Dell
officials) need to find out that customers are not being treated as
they ought to be,'' Roberts said.
</P>
<P>
   Donna Oppenheim chose Dell in June for a server, workstations
and notebooks when she started her Dallas-area business, Grapevine
Medical Systems Inc., which sells software programs for physicians.
</P>
<P>
   But because of problems with several notebooks she ordered _
ranging from shipping delays to missing software and two computers
with pinholes in screens _ she had employees sitting idle for weeks
while waiting for new equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was paying five people for two months to sit there because
we didn't have computers,'' Oppenheim said.
</P>
<P>
   Oppenheim said she bought notebooks from Compaq. This week, Dell
told her it would credit her account for the $25,000 order.
</P>
<P>
   The experience of Atlanta-based HomeBanc Mortgage Corp., the
leading residential lender in Georgia, was more serious. The
company estimates its five-month problem with Dell notebooks cost
it $350,000 in lost business.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, HomeBanc bought 100 Latitude notebooks from Dell
for loan officers in South Georgia and Florida. Almost immediately
they started failing because the motherboards were loose, said
Robert Bennett, HomeBanc's executive vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Warranty work with Dell's partner, GetronicsWang, that was
supposed to arrive within a day didn't come for five days, he said.
He said Dell resisted accepting responsibility for the defects.
</P>
<P>
   ``They put the burden back on us to prove their hardware had a
problem,'' said Bennett.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett said things improved once he reached Dell Senior Vice
President Joe Marengi, who flew to Atlanta this summer to meet with
him. The faulty notebooks will be replaced with faster machines and
the company has agreed to buy an additional 175 Latitudes, Bennett
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bad news is it took quite a long time to get here,'' he
said, adding that Dell salespeople pleaded with him not to go over
their heads.

SPORTS COLUMN: ENJOY THE SHOW AT SHORTSTOP  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JACK CURRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The statements uttered as facts begin with one or two people
when Derek Jeter ambles out of the team hotel in Boston. The words
turn into verbal abuse when he emerges from the dugout for batting
practice at Fenway Park. The noise escalates to a deafening level
when he saunters toward the on-deck circle in the first inning.
</P>
<P>
   There are thousands of fans booing Jeter, but there are always a
few who are a little louder and a little more proud of their own
slick shortstop. So they let Jeter know that, in their opinion, he
cannot lift Nomar Garciaparra's batting gloves. Not today, not next
week, never.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, when I go to Boston, that's all I hear,'' Jeter
said. ``How bad I am. How I'm no Nomar. I'm sure when he comes
here, he hears the same things.''
</P>
<P>
   Affirmative. Garciaparra grinned when he heard about Jeter's
ears buzzing in Boston and confirmed that his ears buzz whenever he
visits the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hear the same thing here about Derek being great and stuff
like that,'' Garciaparra said. ``I think it's all in good fun. I
have the utmost respect for all the fans here.''
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra is obviously not as loose with his opinions about
New York fans as the Braves' Chipper Jones was, but his gracious
sentiments will not prevent them from treating him like an imposter
who is invading Jeter's hallowed ground between second and third
base. This is the way it should be. Baseball should be about
debating who is better, team versus team, player versus player and,
of course, Nomar versus Derek.
</P>
<P>
   Jeter and Garciaparra are talented, respectful, team-oriented
players who symbolize their teams; the businesslike Yankees and the
resilient Red Sox, and, therefore, the two shortstops symbolize
this rivalry. It is a different rivalry now, not built on hatred so
much anymore. That could change during this century-concluding
American League Championship Series. Even Roger Clemens said,
``This might rekindle it a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   It should. The rivalry between the Yankees and the Red Sox will
always be intense because they have a history, because they are in
the American League East, because they are so close geographically
and because, for the next decade, it will continue to be
embellished by Jeter and Garciaparra.
</P>
<P>
   ``It only enhances it,'' Yankee pitcher David Cone said. ``It's
already a good matchup and then you add two good, young players to
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra has more power (27 homers to Jeter's 24), but Jeter
has more range and is better defensively (14 errors to Nomar's 17).
Garciaparra won the batting title with a .357 average, with Jeter
second at .350. Garciaparra has helped a pesky team reach the
post-season for the last two years, but Jeter has helped the
Yankees win two World Series titles in the last three years.
</P>
<P>
   Who is better? Who cares? Enjoy the show.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who would have thought they were going to be putting up the
numbers they do?'' asked John Valentin, who was supplanted by
Garciaparra and now plays third for Boston. ``It's like Nintendo. I
still think they're going to get better.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the way it should be. Fans stillabout whether Ted
Williams or Joe DiMaggio was the superior hitter. Don Zimmer said
on Tuesday that Carlton Fisk hated Thurman Munson and vice versa.
Don Mattingly was perturbed when Wade Boggs sat out the last three
games of the 1986 season against the Yankees with a phantom
hamstring injury and won the batting title over Mattingly, .357 to
.352. Mike Torrez helped the Yankees win the World Series in 1977
and helped the Red Sox lose a playoff game and so much more to
Bucky Dent in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know if you're a Yankee fan, you hate the Red Sox,'' Jeter
said. ``If you're a Red Sox fan, you hate the Yankees.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is apparently no animosity between Jeter and
Garciaparra, just respect. When Jeter jogged onto the field to
replace Garciaparra during the All-Star Game in Fenway Park last
July, they hugged. When Jeter batted, he tapped his left foot and
imitated Garciaparra's constant fidgeting in the batter's box.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said I didn't do it right,'' Jeter said. ``I struck out.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeter is perfect for New York and Garciaparra is perfect for
Boston and neither team would trade one for the other. Boston is a
conservative town and Garciaparra mixes seamlessly into this
attitude with his no-nonsense style. He dislikes talking about
himself and someone who has been around the Red Sox said that
Garciaparra looks weird wearing sunglasses. Even that seems too
flashy for him.
</P>
<P>
   Jeter, who has a white mother and an African-American father,
thrives in the multicultural melting pot of New York. He once said
that fans are not sure what nationality he is so everyone embraces
him, which is being modest about his skills. Jeter is not too
flashy, but he has been on the cover of GQ, he endorses clothing by
Michael Jordan and he has more pizazz than Garciaparra. Argue about
which shortstop is better, but, more important, watch and enjoy
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever I hear my name in the same sentence as his, I think
that's an honor,'' Garciaparra said. ``I think he's absolutely
tremendous. Put my name with his and I'm saying, `Wow, that's an
honor.''' &QL;

SENATE APPROVES $8.7 BILLION FOR EMERGENCY AID TO FARMERS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.J., Pa., Vt., Iowa, N.C., Cuba)   By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Driven by low crop prices, bad weather in many
parts of the country and arcane farm-state politics, the Senate
gave final legislative approval Wednesday to an $8.7 billion
package of emergency aid to farmers.
</P>
<P>
   This is the second straight year Congress has spent billions to
bail farmers out of financial trouble, raising doubt about the
political practicality of applying free-market principles to
American farmers.
</P>
<P>
   The emergency assistance is part of a $69 billion spending bill
to finance agriculture and food programs in the current fiscal
year.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate approved the final version by a vote of 74-26. The
opponents were almost all Easterners from both parties who opposed
the way the bill dealt with milk prices.
</P>
<P>
   The House gave its final approval to the measure on Oct. 1.
President Clinton is expected to sign the measure quickly. The
Agriculture Department said checks should begin going out to
farmers within two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The new fiscal year began on Oct. 1, but the agriculture bill is
only the sixth of 13 spending bills for the federal departments and
agencies to clear Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The government has been running on stop-gap legislation that
will expire on Oct. 21 and will almost certainly have to be
extended to keep federal offices open while the politicians work
out their differences.
</P>
<P>
   More than half the money in the bill approved Wednesday will go
for food stamps and other nutrition programs. Much of the rest is
earmarked for uncontested agriculture and rural development
programs.
</P>
<P>
   To get the final version through Congress, several potentially
controversial items were left out by the conferees who reconciled
the bills passed by the House and Senate. One would have allowed
food and medicine to be shipped to Cuba. Another would have
prohibited the Food and Drug Administration from approving abortion
drugs like RU-486.
</P>
<P>
   But senators from the East balked when the conferees excluded
provisions that would have blocked a new milk-pricing system
favored by the Clinton administration and would have allowed the
continuation of an arrangement that keeps a floor on milk prices in
New England. Several other Eastern states hoped to join the New
England compact.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday the Senate voted, 79-20, to cut off a filibuster by
the Easterners and bring the bill to a vote.
</P>
<P>
   The dairy question led to strange political bedfellows. Liberal
Democrats like Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont and Frank R. Lautenberg
of New Jersey voted alongside conservatives like Rick Santorum,
R-Pa., and Robert C. Smith, a Republican-turned-Independent from
New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   The emergency assistance itself had no opposition, though many
senators argued that $8.7 billion was inadequate in the face of
Midwestern grain prices that are the lowest in decades and the
large crop losses from the drought this summer in the East, floods
in the South and crop disease in the upper Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Tom Harkin, an Iowa Democrat who voted for the bill,
c it to ``throwing a leaking life raft to a drowning
person.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It helps a little bit,'' he added, ``but it's not a long-term
solution to the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The consensus in Congress is that additional emergency
assistance will be needed when the farm losses in North Carolina
from Hurricane Floyd are tallied.
</P>
<P>
   Farm politics is guided much more by regional interests than
partisan ones. But Democrats used the bill Wednesday to renew their
attack on the Freedom to Farm Act of 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The law was one of the central elements of Republican dogma that
party leaders got enacted after they won control of Congress in the
1994 election. It abolished most of the government price-support
programs, in place since the 1930s, on the theory that farmers
would fare better in an unfettered marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers were happy in 1996 and 1997, when commodity prices were
high and they were entitled to what were called transition payments
from Washington.
</P>
<P>
   But when grain prices began to plunge last year, farmers turned
to the government for help, and the politicians who represent them,
regardless of party, obliged.
</P>
<P>
   ``The transition turned out to be more difficult than we
anticipated,'' said Sen. Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, a leading
Republican supporter of the Freedom to Farm Act.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, Grassley said, was not the principle of the law but
the fact that its authors did not anticipate such events as the
devaluation of Brazilian currency and the crash in Asian economies,
which had a devastating effect on American farm exports.

GRAND JURY DISMISSED IN RAMSEY CASE, BUT GOVERNOR MAY ACT
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga.)  (rk) 
 By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOULDER, Colo. _ Nearly three years after JonBenet Ramsey was
found beaten and strangled in her parents' home here, prosecutors
said Wednesday they did not have enough evidence to charge anyone
with her killing and were dismissing the grand jury in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Little more than an hour after Alexander M. Hunter, the Boulder
city and county district attorney, announced that decision, Gov.
Bill Owens of Colorado said he was considering the appointment of a
special pro in the killing.
</P>
<P>
   ``While I am not presently in a position to comment on the work
of this grand jury,'' Owens said in a statement, ``I do know one
fact, a little girl was brutally murdered in Boulder, Colo., and
the killer or killers remain free today. As governor I have the
power to appoint a special prosecutor. I am reviewing this option
and will make a decision shortly.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter's decision seemed at first to end a highly visible and
contentious case in which the 6-year-old beauty queen's wealthy
parents, John and Patsy Ramsey, were widely regarded as the prime _
and virtually only _ suspects.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, it underscored major concerns over shoddy
police work in the early hours after the girl's body was found on
Dec. 26, 1996, and what many called Hunter's deference to the
Ramseys, who for months were not questioned about their daughter's
death.
</P>
<P>
   Owens had raised the possibility of appointing a special
prosecutor just before Hunter impaneled the grand jury on Sept. 15,
1998, after he was was prodded for months to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking before a throng of reporters outside the Boulder County
Justice Center, Hunter said late Wednesday afternoon: ``The Boulder
grand jury has completed its work and will not return. No charges
have been filed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yet I must report to you,'' he added, ``that I and my
prosecution task force believe we do not have sufficient evidence
to warrant the filing of charges against anyone who has been
investigated at this time.''
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear, however, whether the grand jury wanted to hand
up any indictments and, if so, whether prosecutors ignored their
sentiments, fearing they could not win a case before a jury.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter, who declined to answer questions, said he and his
colleagues would hold a news conference on Thursday. He said grand
jurors would not answer questions `'today or ever.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter seemed to leave the door open for further action if new
evidence was developed. That evidence would be presented to a
second grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   The the girl's parents, who moved to Atlanta months after their
daughter's death, were considered suspects because of suspicions
about a ransom note they said they found in their home before
Ramsey found JonBenet's body in the basement.
</P>
<P>
   The 370-word ransom note was written with a pen and paper from
the house and included a demand for $118,000, an amount identical
to what Ramsey received as a bonus in 1995 from the company he once
owned, Access Graphics. It was signed by ``a small foreign
faction.'' Handwriting experts have said the note could have been
written by Mrs. Ramsey.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the investigation the Ramseys have steadfastly denied
any involvement in the murder. ``I'm appalled that anyone would
think that John or I would be involved in such a hideous, heinous
crime,'' Mrs. Ramsey said in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, they did not cooperate with investigators. Then they
answered their questions for three days in June 1998. Then their
relationship with authorities turned sour again, as they accused
police, through one of their lawyers, of victimizing them by a
``pattern and practice of police leaks and outright slander.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The grand jury of eight women and four men produced a roller
coaster of expectation and speculation, partly because of its
erratic schedule.
</P>
<P>
   The panel heard evidence from police, detectives, hand-writing
experts, JonBenet's brother Burke, who is now, 12; and two adult
children from Ramsey's previous marriage, Melinda Ramsey Long and
John Andrew Ramsey, who were not in Colorado at the time JonBenet's
body was found.
</P>
<P>
   The parents were never called to testify.
</P>
<P>
   JonBenet's death was sensational enough, since she was the
daughter of wealthy parents from a mountainside enclave where
homicide is almost unknown. But unlike so many other children who
die young anonymously, she had attained a public image as an
ebullient beauty-contest queen, the 1995 Little Miss Colorado,
whose talents and smiling radiance, sequined outfits and
fuchsia-colored lipstick were all captured by pageant videotapes
and generously shown on television news reports whenever some
development arose in the case.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, her celebrity burned into the American psyche,
making her, even in death, one of those famous people, like Oprah
and Cher, who are known just by a singular name.
</P>
<P>
   At least six books were written about the case, one serving as a
basis for a television movie now in production. But none drew any
conclusion as to the identity of the killer.
</P>
<P>
   The work of the Boulder police was heavily criticized and police
officials conceded that the murder investigation was compromised
from the beginning. Police officers arrived at the home thinking,
because of the ransom note, that the girl had been kidnapped.
Ramsey found her body after he was allowed to search the house
without an escort. He brought her body upstairs, possibly tainting
evidence.
</P>
<P>
   The first detective on the scene, Linda Arndt, either placed a
blanket over the dead girl or allowed Ramsey to do so, perhaps
spoiling more evidence, and further allowed the Ramseys and friends
visiting at the time to wander freely about the 6,500-square foot
house.
</P>
<P>
   It was only weeks later that investigators performed a more
thorough and scientific search of the house for evidence. Still,
police officers said Hunter's office had hurt the investigation by
being too easy on the Ramseys.

CONGRESS EXPANDS CHOICES ON PUNISHING PAKISTAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (With PAKISTAN-COUP) 
(lh) 
 By STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congress moved Wednesday to give President Clinton
greater flexibility in deciding whether to impose sanctions against
the Pakistani military a day after the overthrow of the elected
government there.
</P>
<P>
   The change, which was embedded in a $268 billion defense
appropriations bill approved by the House, technically eases
sanctions that have prohibited U.S. military assistance and arms
sales to Pakistan since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   The House voted Wednesday to approve the bill, which House and
Senate negotiators worked out last week, 372-55. It now goes to the
Senate, where approval is also expected.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of Wednesday's House vote was a coincidence, but the
change in sanctions underscored the complexities of the U.S.
response to the coup and other events in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has endorsed the change in the
sanctions, but officials emphasized Wednesday that the United
States would not now begin providing military assistance or
economic aid to Pakistan in light of the coup on Tuesday, led by
Pakistan's army chief, Gen. Pervaiz Musharraf. The bill stops short
of repealing the sanctions outright, which the Senate originally
included in its version of the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it gives the president the authority to waive a raft of
sanctions that, by law, are now imposed automatically against
Pakistan, as well as India, because of their development of nuclear
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said Wednesday that the changes would
give the president greater flexibility in offering incentives and
disincentives to the Pakistanis, rather than tying his hands with
blanket restrictions on aid. At the same time, officials said, the
coup had sorely undercut any Pakistani hopes of receiving aid.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no intention of pursuing military sales at this
time,'' the State Department's spokesman, James Rubin, said. ``What
we intend to do is seek from Pakistan the earliest possible
restoration of civilian government.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement released Wednesday night, President Clinton
announced that he had ordered the U.S. ambassador, William B.
Mylam, back to Pakistan's capital, Islamabad, to push the
administration's call for a return to civilian rule. ``Pakistan's
interests would be served by a prompt return to civilian rule and
restoration of the democratic process,'' Clinton said. ``I urge
that Pakistan move quickly in that direction.''
</P>
<P>
   The legislation to ease sanctions had been part of a bipartisan
congressional effort, supported by the administration, to try to
deepen its engagement with Pakistan following years of tensions
over its development of nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The United States cut off all arms sales and military assistance
in 1990 after concluding that Pakistan possessed nuclear weapons.
Pakistan, like India, faced even more sweeping sanctions on trade
and food assistance last year after detonating nuclear weapons in
May 1998. But members of Congress, worried that those sanctions
could hurt farmers and manufacturers, gave Clinton the authority to
waive some of those.
</P>
<P>
   The new bill would make that waiver authority permanent and
expand it to include the prohibitions on military assistance, as
well as those on sales of products that have both civilian and
military uses. The United States would still prohibit sales of
military items that could be used to develop missiles or nuclear
weapons.

TWO STARS SHINE BRIGHTLY IN PAC-10 GLOOM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   XX SEATTLE _ As far as can be determined, there is no
coaching-controversy angle for Washington's game Saturday against
Arizona State.
</P>
<P>
   Sun Devils coach Bruce Snyder never succeeded Rick Neuheisel.
Nor has he publicly complained that the Washington coach cheated.
He has never coached a Seattle team, as did Dennis Erickson.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Snyder has not bellyached about Neuheisel's contract,
sideline dress, singing, hair color, play calling or substitution
patterns.
</P>
<P>
   Absent these talking points, for the first time in Neuheisel's
rookie year at Washington, we are left with a plain old college
football game between two plain old football teams, one 3-2 and the
other 2-3.
</P>
<P>
   Jeez. That means this week's stories are about ... players?!
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough.
</P>
<P>
   Just in time, too. The Pac-10's two best will be at Husky
Stadium: ASU running back J.R. Redmond and UW quarterback Marques
Tuiasosopo.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, arguments can be made for Stanford wide receiver Troy
Walters and UCLA wide receiver Danny Farmer. But, please, no
arguments for defensive players.
</P>
<P>
   Bad as the Pac-10 is this year, the defense by conference
members could not be more embarrassing if played in orange fright
wigs, oversize shoes and red noses.
</P>
<P>
   Check out this stat: USC leads the conference in scoring defense
at 24.2 points given up per game. For perspective, that's nearly a
touchdown worse than the highest number since the league began
keeping the stat in 1954: The '97 ASU team surrendered 18.5 points
a game.
</P>
<P>
   For further perspective, the famed Arizona ``Desert Swarm'' in
1992 has the Pac-10 record low at 8.9, followed by the '92
Washington unit's 9.2.
</P>
<P>
   For a conference whose leaders traditionally used to give up
only a couple of touchdowns a game, the '99 defenses are rubble
where once were walls.
</P>
<P>
   But enough about defenseless defenders. In Redmond and
Tuiasosopo, there is some serious star power in a league that is
otherwise nearly lights out.
</P>
<P>
   Redmond, who is recovering from a shoulder separation Saturday
against Notre Dame, was a preseason Heisman Trophy candidate who
led the Pac-10 last year in all-purpose yards, including 254
against Washington in the 42-38 loss to the Huskies.
</P>
<P>
   Said Neuheisel: ``There's reasons why he's considered a top-10
pick in the NFL draft.''
</P>
<P>
   The virtues of Tuiasosopo are slightly more elusive, though far
more influential in the UW season. The fact is that teams can load
up to stop Redmond, as Notre Dame did last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Loading up to stop Tuiasosopo is not possible.
</P>
<P>
   While Washington's line and running backs deserve credit for
some of the improvement in the offense _ the Huskies have averaged
almost 39 minutes of possession time in their three consecutive
wins _ Tuiasosopo's versatility has made it difficult for defenses
to do anything but play Washington straight up.
</P>
<P>
   Tuiasosopo made the point well Saturday on the opening drive
against the Beavers. Running the option around the right side, he
kept the ball until three defenders were taking him down. Then he
flipped a long, dangerous pitch to running back Willie Hurst, who
one-handed the ball behind him and scored from 41 yards.
</P>
<P>
   It was the kind of ``no-no! ... yes-yes!'' play that makes
football coaches familiar with the acronym EKG. It's also the kind
of play that defines stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Marques thinks he can make that play, then I think it's a
good decision,'' Neuheisel said. ``That's why you recruit big-time
athletes.''
</P>
<P>
   As Snyder put it, ``I think he's a really amazing performer.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuiasosopo's deftness with the option is no real surprise. What
has improved this season is his sometimes suspect throwing.
</P>
<P>
   He's hitting on 58 percent of his passes with seven touchdowns
and five interceptions. Partly because of a lack of speed at wide
receiver, Tuiasosopo is still not throwing deep _ his longest
completion is 36 yards _ but he's also only a junior.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still believe he can be a very talented drop-back
quarterback on Sundays,'' Neuheisel said, referring to an NFL
future.
</P>
<P>
   But early on, it was what he wasn't doing in the mental game
that left Tuiasosopo aghast.
</P>
<P>
   ``I apologized to the team for my poor play in the first two
games,'' he said, referring to losses to BYU and Air Force. ``I
wasn't doing everything I could do.''
</P>
<P>
   He bumped up the work load in practice _ more film study, route
practice with receivers and playbook self-tests.
</P>
<P>
   ``My responses to every situation had to be cleaner and
faster,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The results are most obvious in the fourth quarter. Through five
games, he has 28 completions in 40 attempts for 338 yards and four
TDs, with one pick. He also has rushed for 62 yards, giving him 400
yards of total offense in final periods.
</P>
<P>
   However, none of those accomplishments contribute to
controversies about coaching. It just makes for entertaining,
winning football, a consolation prize for which Huskies fans must
learn to adjust.

CRITICISMS OF TYCO CAUSE DROP IN SHARES PRICE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Texas)  (af) 
 By DAVID LEONHART   9 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the latest sign of skittishness on Wall Street, criticisms
from a single investment manager sent shares of one of the decade's
best-performing stocks, Tyco International, plunging Wednesday,
causing the New York Stock Exchange to halt its trading.
</P>
<P>
   Tyco, a manufacturing conglomerate, called the criticisms
``unfounded and malicious'' in a statement released Wednesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Tyco shares have fallen almost 10 percent this week since David
W. Tice, a Dallas fund manager and a prominent short-seller,
questioned the company's accounting practices in its $30 billion
acquisition binge over the last three years.
</P>
<P>
   He said it disguised a decline in cash flow by delaying some
payments and took overly large charges to inflate future earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Its shares fell $7.375 Wednesday, to $96, before trading was
halted by the exchange because of an imbalance of orders.
</P>
<P>
   In its statement, Tyco said quarterly earnings, to be released
Oct. 21, would exceed analysts' expectations. ``I heard the reports
being circulated about our company,'' said L. Dennis Kozlowski,
Tyco's chief executive, ``and I can state unequivocally that they
are false and baseless.''
</P>
<P>
   Prominent analysts did not change their rating on the stock
Wednesday, and Tyco scheduled a conference call for Thursday
morning to assuage investors' fears.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, the stock market suffered its second consecutive bad
day, with the main stock gauges all falling. The Dow has declined
almost 4 percent this week. Even Tice acknowledged that the sharp
reaction to his comments reflected a broader mood among investors.
``It's a sign of a nervous market,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tyco, which is based in Bermuda, has been a star of the
longstanding bull-market run, gobbling up rivals it considered
poorly managed and watching its share price rise from about $11
five years ago. Through holdings including its ADT security unit,
Tyco sells electronic components, fire prevention devices, alarm
systems and medical products.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Wednesday, Tice said he was bothered mainly by
two things: the large charges Tyco has taken after buying other
companies and the drop in cash flow that few investors noticed.
Tice's investment company originally made its criticisms in a
report that was written by Albert Meyer, a senior analyst at the
firm, and sent to investors this week.
</P>
<P>
   Write-offs can make a company's earnings look stronger than they
are because many investors ignore the charges when examining
current earnings but then take them into account when making
comparisons in later years. ``These are the kind of cookie-jar
reserves Arthur Levitt has been railing about,'' Tice said,
referring to a recent campaign by the chairman of the Securities
and Exchange Commission to crack down on accounting tricks.
</P>
<P>
   Tice also said that even though the company showed its cash flow
increasing to $2.1 billion in the first nine months of 1999, up
from $1.5 billion over the corresponding period in 1998, the entire
jump was a result of a delay in payments of taxes and accounts due.
``It looks funny to us,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Phua Young, an analyst at Merrill Lynch, dismissed those
objections, saying that the SEC had looked closely at each of
Tyco's major acquisitions and did not find any problems. ``That
gives me a sense of comfort,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Young also noted that Tyco has told analysts it expects cash
flow to rise to $3.3 billion next year from $1.7 billion in the
fiscal year that ended Sept. 30. That would make its cash flow for
next year nearly as large as its projected net income, a benchmark
for companies with strong balance sheets, Young said. The company
expects to report $22 billion in sales for the fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   Tice said his firm's report did not accuse the company of
violating generally accepted accounting principles.
</P>
<P>
   Tice's Prudent Bear mutual fund was up 17 percent in the third
quarter, making it one of the quarter's top performers, though it
is down 36 percent over the last year.

SENATE VOTES NOT TO RATIFY NUCLEAR TEST BAN TREATY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Republican-controlled Senate voted Wednesday
not to ratify the landmark global test ban treaty, rejecting a
last-minute appeal by Democrats and allied leaders to set aside the
accord aimed at preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The 51-48 vote against it was an unprecedented and stunning
rebuke for President Clinton, who has worked hard to have it
ratified by other nations and to win support for it from U.S.
lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   In an appearance at the White House, Clinton vowed to revive the
treaty again and suggested that he would use it against Republicans
in next year's elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is well-worth fighting for, and I assure you the fight is
far from over,'' the president said, calling the vote ``reckless''
and ``partisan.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a political deal and I hope it will get the treatment
from the American people it richly deserves,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said his administration would continue to abide by the
terms of the treaty anyway and continue with a 7-year-old U.S.
moratorium on nuclear testing.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton needed the backing of two-thirds of the senators, or 67
votes, to win ratification. But only four Republicans joined with
44 Democrats to support it. Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., voted
present.
</P>
<P>
   The vote marked the first time since the Treaty of Versailles
following World War I was defeated that the Senate had rejected an
arms-related pact intended to stop the spread of weapons and the
expansionist ambitions of rogue nations.
</P>
<P>
   It also endede time being decades of bipartisan
cooperation on arms control matters that have helped guide U.S.
foreign policy down a consistent path through both Democratic and
Republican administrations.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Trent Lott, R-Miss., said Republicans had acted
``with great pride'' in rejecting the Comprehensive Test Ban
Treaty, which was negotiated by 154 countries between 1994 and
1996.
</P>
<P>
   Insisting the treaty was ``fatally flawed,'' Lott said
Republicans would not be ``a rubberstamp'' for Clinton's foreign
policy. ``We did the right thing for America,'' he declared.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, however, said rejection of the treaty would only
contribute to instability in areas of the world, such as South
Asia, where nuclear proliferation problems are nearing a crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``With this fateful vote tonight, the world becomes a more
dangerous place,'' said Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich.
</P>
<P>
   Condemnation of the Republican-led effort rejecting the test ban
treaty also came from U.S. allies who have already ratified the
pact signed by 154 countries. British Prime Minister Tony Blair and
other leaders took the unprecedented step of appealing directly to
Republican leaders by letter and phone before the vote, saying that
rejection of the treaty would send a message to emerging nuclear
nations that it's all right to pursue weapons development programs.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats vowed to use the treaty's rejection to portray
Republicans in next year's elections as opponents of global
anti-proliferation efforts designed to prevent the buildup of
nuclear arsenals. Democratic leaders said they would also resubmit
the treaty again next year in hopes of persuading more Republicans
to back it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect this will be an issue in the national elections next
year,'' declared Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D.
</P>
<P>
   In a floor speech prior to the vote, Daschle accused Lott of
choosing partisanship over statesmanship in moving ahead with the
vote on the controversial treaty, which would prohibit all nuclear
test explosions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republican response was cynical. It was a partisan attempt
to embarrass the president and embarrass the Democrats,'' he
charged.
</P>
<P>
   The vote was a major defeat for Clinton, who had made the
initiative a cornerstone of his foreign policy. He and Daschle had
sought to head off a vote by forging a compromise agreement with
Lott on Tuesday that would have shelved the pact in return for
Daschle's written pledge that the Democrats would not try to revive
it until 2001 after Clinton leaves office.
</P>
<P>
   But that tentative deal was ultimately scrapped by four
conservative opponents of the treaty _ Sens. Jesse Helms, R-N.C.,
Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., James Inhofe, R-Okla., and Bob Smith, I-N.H. _
who insisted that Lott not compromise.
</P>
<P>
   As further evidence of just how highly-politicized the test ban
treaty had become, the Republicans beat back an 11th-hour attempt
by Democrats to withdraw it by voting 55-45 strictly along party
lines in favor of holding the final vote.
</P>
<P>
   In the subsequent debate, Helms and other treaty opponents
scoffed at Democrat charges that they were playing politics with
the nation's national security just to ``get even'' with Clinton
for besting them on a host of other issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Give me a break,'' said Helms, who also rejected what he
called ``the Chicken Little argument'' asserted by Democrats and
allied leaders such as Blair that the United States would no longer
be able to object when other countries conduct nuclear test
explosions.
</P>
<P>
   Helms stressed that the treaty would hinder U.S. efforts to
modernize its own nuclear arsenal. He also expressed concerns that
the treaty could not be verified because monitoring technology does
not yet exist that can distinguish between low-level nuclear
explosions and naturally occurring phenomena, such as earthquakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must have a clean break (on the treaty) so that the next
president can establish American credibility on nonproliferation,''
Helms said.
</P>
<P>
   Helms was able to keep more than enough Republicans from siding
with the Democrats. Only four Republicans senators _ Arlen Specter
of Pennsylvania, John Chafee of Rhode Island, Gordon Smith of
Oregon and James Jeffords of Vermont _ voted in favor of the
treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Specter agreed with the Democrats that rejection of the pact
would be ``an open invitation for other nations to test.'' In hopes
of winning more GOP support, he also pointed to an ``escape
clause'' in the treaty that would allow the United States to
withdraw its support if U.S. nuclear officials conclude at any time
that the safety and reliability of the U.S. arsenal cannot be
certified without further testing.
</P>
<P>
   The raw politization of the issue was apparent from the first
moment debate began Wednesday. Tempers flared, for example, when
Lott rejected a request by Byrd to speak for 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd eventually got his time and he used it to blast Lott for
engaging in partisan politics and running roughshod over the
minority.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in this body for 41 years ... and as a (former)
majority leader and minority leader I never once objected to a
senator's request to speak,'' a red-faced Byrd snapped at Lott.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to have better comity in this Senate. The American
people are watching,'' Byrd said.
</P>
<P>
   Responding, Lott offered no apologies for his handling of the
treaty or his treatment of the senior senator. Instead he simply
summed up the attitude on both sides of the aisle by observing that
``passions do run high.''

AIRBUS IS SAID TO WIN ORDER FROM FRONTIER 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Frontier Airlines has decided to buy 20 new narrow-body jets
from Airbus Industrie, two people close to the negotiations said,
becoming the latest airline to choose the European consortium over
its archrival, Boeing Co.
</P>
<P>
   Frontier, a low-cost carrier that flies to 19 cities from its
base in Denver, Colo., plans to replace its current fleet of 19
Boeing 737s, beginning in 2001. The two people said that the
airline is in the final stages of negotiating a letter of intent
with Airbus that includes a firm order for 10 Airbus A319 and A318
jets, as well as options for another 10 aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   At list prices, the deal is worth about $1 billion, though
airlines often pay much less than list.
</P>
<P>
   Samuel D. Addoms, Frontier's president and chief executive, said
in a telephone interview Wednesday that the airline had been
negotiating with Airbus and Boeing for six months, but he declined
to say whether a final decision had been made. Spokesmen for Airbus
and Boeing also declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   The loss of Frontier is yet another blow to Boeing, which has
lost several longtime customers to Airbus in recent years. Last
week, British Airways, which bought its first Airbus planes last
year, said it had placed an additional order for the 100-seat A318
to replace its fleet of 44 Boeing 757s.
</P>
<P>
   Since its resurrection under new management in 1994, Frontier
has struggled to compete against UAL Corp.'s United Airlines, which
dominates Denver's airport.
</P>
<P>
   Frontier turned a profit for the first time last year, making
owning rather than leasing planes more cost-efficient, Addoms said.
</P>
<P>
   One person close to Frontier said that the airline, which only
offers economy service, chose Airbus in part because the fuselage
of its narrow-body jets is slightly wider than the 737s, giving
Frontier the ability to offer slightly wider seats or a wider
center aisle.

THE OTHER MARTINEZ HEADS FOR THE SPOTLIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By STEVE POPPER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ He is the Martinez brother who pitched a no-hitter.
He is the one who struck out 18 batters in one game. He is the one
who will take the mound at Yankee Stadium Thursday night in Game 2
of the American League Championship Series.
</P>
<P>
   He is Ramon Martinez, the older brother of Pedro. That Ramon
Martinez would pitch in a meaningful October game against David
Cone is quite improbable after a rotator cuff injury threatened to
end his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is great,'' Ramon said of the prospect of the two
brothers starting for the same team in the postseason, a baseball
rarity that until now has been identified with Dizzy and Paul
``Daffy'' Dean, who won two games each as they led the St. Louis
Cardinals over the Detroit Tigers in the 1934 World Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since the beginning, I've enjoyed being with my brother this
year, and we've got a chance to make it to the World Series,'' the
31-year-old right-hander said. ``I mean, I don't think anybody
could ask for anything more.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox could ask for Ramon to pitch the way he did before
the surgery, when his production with Los Angeles placed him among
the league's elite pitchers. At the time, Ramon, who was 123-77
with the Los Angeles Dodgers, was the prominent Martinez brother,
and Pedro was trying to establish himself with the Montreal Expos.
</P>
<P>
   But the elder Martinez cannot be what he was then. Clearly,
Ramon is still finding his way back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see any difference,'' Ramon said. ``My velocity maybe,
but everything else is there. I can throw all my pitches. I don't
have any kind of problem with my arm. And I feel better and
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Cone, who has had to endure his own shoulder problems,
understood what it feels like to step back on the mound filled with
uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure in his own mind he didn't know what to expect when he
went out there,'' Cone said. ``It sort of came on in a hurry for
him. It's a remarkable comeback. I don't think anyone was counting
on him pitching in the postseason for Boston. Not only has he
pitched, he seems to be back. It's a real emotional story, sort of
a tough thing to deal with, that you're back, that your arm
strength is back.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox took a gamble on him, signing him last March 11
after he had undergone the surgery on his right shoulder on June
30, 1998. There was some hesitance on the part of Pedro to bring
his older brother, a more quiet and sensitive man, to Boston. But
the team discussed its plans with Pedro and the two sides agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue of whether we were going to sign him or make him an
offer was discussed with Pedro prior to us extending an offer to
Ramon,'' Dan Duquette, the Red Sox general manager, said. ``It was
discussed, and Pedro thought about it. We talked about it a couple
of times.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Pedro came around, Duquette smiled and said, ``Ramon
signed with us.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramon made his first rehabilitation start last June 21, throwing
two innings in the New York Penn League for the Lowell Red Sox.
After 10 rehabilitation assignments, while working his way through
the Red Sox chain, he finally found his way to a major-league mound
on Sept. 2.
</P>
<P>
   Four starts during the regular season totaling 20 2/3 innings
was all he had pitched when he took the mound in Game 3 of the
division series against Cleveland. But he limited the Indians to
two runs in 5 2/3 innings in Boston's 9-3 victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``He put a lot of air miles on this year, bus miles too,''
Boston Manager Jimy Williams said. ``When he joined us, he started
a game, and then I brought him in and said, `Listen, maybe it is
just asking too much of you.' But the kid kept working, and he
never stopped one day from doing his exercises. He was just trying
to come back and help our club win.
</P>
<P>
   ``He still felt in his mind he could pitch and help us. We had a
situation later on during the trip, in Cleveland, when Pat Rapp had
to leave our club and was supposed to start a game. In my mind,
flying at 35,000 feet, I said, `I'll pitch Ramon.' He pitched very
good there. He got better with each of his starts.''
</P>
<P>
   While Ramon once struck out 18 in a game and the best Pedro has
done is 17, Pedro did strike out 15 or more batters six times this
season, and the 17 strikeouts were against the Yankees in a
one-hitter he pitched last month. So being ranked second in the
Martinez family is hardly shameful. But Ramon is happy just to be
back, pitching in a crucial situation, even if he has to resort
more to craft than to raw talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I started my rehab, that was the hardest part because
there was a lot of pain,'' he said. ``There was a lot of soreness,
but I never stopped. I never gave up.''

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CARLTON THOMPSON  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
ATLANTA _ Their backup catcher is playing like Carlton Fisk, their
baby-faced closer looks like he has been here a million times, and
their starting pitching has been everything you might expect from
the best collection of starters in baseball.
<TEXT>
<P>
   And, oh, yeah: The Atlanta Braves' manager is batting close to
1.000 when it comes to making key decisions in the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Mets are in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves extended their postseason winning streak to five
games with a come-from-behind 4-3 victory Wednesday in Game 2 of
the National League Championship Series. If you thought it was only
the Astros who had trouble solving the complexities of the Braves,
think again.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves are two victories away from another trip to the World
Series. And from the looks of things, there's not much the Mets can
do about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd better do something soon,'' Mets third baseman Robin
Ventura said. ``We're running out of time.''
</P>
<P>
   Time might as well be on the Braves' side; everything else is.
</P>
<P>
   In the 29-year history of the NLCS, only two teams _ the 1984
Cubs and the 1985 Dodgers _ have failed to reach the World Series
after winning the first two games.
</P>
<P>
   Today is a travel day in the best-of-seven series, which resumes
Friday at New York's Shea Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going to New York up 2-0 gives us a lot of confidence, and
maybe it puts a little pressure on them, too,'' said Braves starter
Kevin Millwood, who won his second playoff game.
</P>
<P>
   Millwood outdueled Mets starter Kenny Rogers, who was cruising
along until the Braves exploded for four runs in a sixth-inning
outburst keyed by a pair of two-run homers _ one by Brian Jordan
and the other by Eddie Perez.
</P>
<P>
   The little-known catcher is 4-for-7 with two homers and three
RBIs in the series.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the key,'' said Mets manager Bobby Valentine, who
second-guessed himself for allowing Rogers to pitch to Perez.
``That was absolutely the wrong move. I had no reason for it; it
was just not the right move to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of things that went through my mind. It was
just the wrong decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Braves manager Bobby Cox wouldn't know about that. Every move he
made turned to gold.
</P>
<P>
   If it were possible to credit two pitchers with a save in the
same game, John Rocker and John Smoltz each would have received one
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Smoltz got the save in his first career postseason appearance
out of the bullpen. Smoltz pitched the ninth inning, but you could
argue that Rocker actually saved the game in the eighth when he
struck out John Olerud and Robin Ventura to bail Millwood out of a
jam.
</P>
<P>
   Because Rocker pitched 1 innings in Game 1 and had worked past
the Mets' two dangerous lefthanded hitters, Cox wisely used the
hard-throwing Smoltz to close Wednesday's game. Smoltz, who is
scheduled to start Game 4 on Saturday, would have done his
between-starts throwing Wednesday anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I had him in my hip pocket,'' Cox said of Smoltz, who
reached 96 mph on the radar gun.
</P>
<P>
   It's the third time Cox has used a starting pitcher in relief
during this postseason. Millwood and Greg Maddux worked out of the
bullpen against the Astros in Game 3 of the Division Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to have good makeup, and you have to be kind of
special,'' Cox said. ``I'm sure a lot of pitchers could do it, and
these guys have pretty good stuff, too. You kind of want to get
them in there; it's not a desperate-type thing.''
</P>
<P>
   If the move had backfired, Cox would have opened himself to
second-guessing for using his closer, Rocker, too soon. But when
Rocker entered the game, the Mets had a runner on second base with
one out.
</P>
<P>
   Considering Olerud and Ventura are a combined 0-for-11 with
seven career strikeouts against Rocker, Cox picked a good time to
use his closer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think when you have an opportunity to win, you'd better grab
ahold of it,'' Cox said. ``It was a critical part of the
ballgame.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets scored first on Roger Cedeno's RBI single in the second
and stretched the lead to 2-0 when former Astros farmhand Melvin
Mora homered in the fifth. It was the first home run of Mora's
brief big-league career.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves killed the Mets' early momentum with two swings in
the sixth inning. Not surprisingly, Chipper Jones walked prior to
Jordan's home run.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love it when people challenge me, and if the Mets want to
continue to walk Chipper to get to me, then I'm just going to
continue to take advantage of those opportunities,'' Jordan said.
``So far, I've been pretty fortunate.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones said: ``They've been pitching me carefully, and now
they're going to have to pitch B.J. carefully. He did this to
Houston, too. I think people are going to start looking at our
lineup and see that I'm the only sure out.''
</P>
<P>
   The way things are going, the Braves might be able to wrap up
the series in New York even without much of a contribution from
Chip-pah.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. Byron Dorgan reached the limit of his patience
on Sept. 8.
</P>
<P>
   Dorgan, a Democrat from North Dakota, took to the Senate floor
that day to denounce the Republican leadership for refusing to
permit debate on the worldwide treaty to ban nuclear testing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I am not here to cast aspersions on any member of the
Senate,'' said Dorgan, doing just that with an attack on Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott. Dorgan said Lott had failed in his duty
_ to the Senate and to the world _ to allow consideration of the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. Until Lott relented, Dorgan said,
``I intend to plant myself on the floor like a potted plant'' and
block any routine business from coming before the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be a tough place to run if you do not decide
to bring this issue to the floor of the Senate,'' Dorgan threatened
Lott.
</P>
<P>
   It was a foolish and empty threat, Clinton administration
officials and some of Dorgan's Democratic colleagues now say. Not
only did it offend Lott's sense of his role as master of the
Senate, it precipitated Wednesday night's vote that defeated the
treaty and humiliated President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   What Dorgan and other advocates of the test ban treaty did notwhen he issued his threat in September was that the
Republicans already had more than enough votes to decisively reject
the treaty.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a sharp stick in the eye of the Republicans,'' said a
chagrined senior administration official. ``They called our
bluff.''
</P>
<P>
   The demise of the test ban treaty is a tale of fatal
miscalculation by Senate Democrats, benign neglect by the White
House and sleight of hand by Senate Republicans and other opponents
of the agreement. The result pleased Lott and his associates, but
it shined a harsh light on the institution of the Senate and left
U.S. allies bewildered yet again by the nation's strange way of
doing public business.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate action was a particularly sharp repudiation of
Clinton because he had sold the treaty as a national security
imperative for the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Since last winter, a handful of Republicans led by Sen. Jon Kyl
of Arizona had been secretly proselytizing their fellow members
about the treaty and accumulating committed votes against it. They
enlisted several former top U.S. officials who opposed the treaty,
including former Defense Secretary James Schlesinger and retired
Gen. Brent Scowcroft, a former national security adviser, to help
sway their colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   In May, Kyl told Lott he had 34 firm Republican votes against
the treaty, meaning that advocates of the treaty could not reach
the two-thirds majority needed to approve it.
</P>
<P>
   Lott reported the news to Sen. Jesse Helms, chairman of the
Foreign Relations Committee, an ardent foe of the nuclear testing
agreement, and suggested that Helms could safely release the treaty
for a quick rejection on the Senate floor.
</P>
<P>
   Helms said, ``Get me more,'' according to an aide. He wanted the
treaty finished, dead, with no chance of revival, the aide said.
Kyl continued quietly rounding up opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats did not see the opposition to the treaty hardening in
large part because relations between the parties are so bad that
Democrats and Republicans often do not talk to each other about
pending business. The White House's legislative affairs operation
likewise did not detect the looming disaster for the president,
according to a senior administration official.
</P>
<P>
   Although President Clinton and Senate Democrats had periodically
issued calls for consideration of the treaty since Clinton
submitted it to the Senate in September 1997, they began their
agitation in earnest this summer.
</P>
<P>
   All 45 Democratic senators signed a letter to Helms on July 20
urging him to hold hearings on the treaty and report it to the
Senate for debate by September, so that the United States could
attend a conference of countries that had signed the treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Helms responded a week later with a scornful letter, saying he
would not consider the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty until after he
had disposed of two other international agreements the
administration cared about, amendments to the Anti-Ballistic
Missile treaty and the Kyoto global-warming pact.
</P>
<P>
   ``I note your distress at my floccinaucinihilipilification of
the CTBT,'' Helms wrote, using a word meaning ``considering as
worthless.'' ``I do not share your enthusiasm for this treaty for a
variety of reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   The matter lay dormant through the Congress' August recess, but
when lawmakers returned in early September, some Democrats were
determined to press the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a frustration with the failure to get this treaty
considered, a legitimate frustration,'' said Sen. Carl Levin,
D-Mich. He acknowledged that Democratic impatience gave Lott all
the excuse he needed to call for a quick vote on the treaty, a vote
he was certain he would win.
</P>
<P>
   ``They put us in a position of looking like we didn't want the
treaty to come up if we opposed that kind of extremely rapid
consideration,'' Levin said.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 22, Senate Democratic Minority Leader Thomas Daschle
and Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., the senior Democrat on the Foreign
Relations Committee, assembled other Democratic supporters of the
treaty to meet with White House National Security Adviser Samuel
Berger to plot their next move.
</P>
<P>
   Biden told Berger that he intended to try to make good on
Dorgan's threat to disrupt other Senate business in a bid to speed
consideration of the weapons testing treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Biden and other Democrats, ignorant of the deeply rooted
Republican opposition to the treaty, thought at that point that as
many as 25 Republicans could be persuaded to vote to approve the
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time, we felt we needed to bring this to a head, any
way we could,'' Biden recalled. He told Berger that unless the
Democrats acted, the treaty would remain bottled up by Helms in the
Foreign Relations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Berger asked, presciently, ``What if they call for up or down
vote?'' Biden recalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the best way,'' Biden replied, ``but it's better than
nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   A week later, in a private conversation on the Senate floor,
Lott told Biden that he would bring up the test ban treaty if
Democrats lifted their threat to obstruct the Senate calendar.
</P>
<P>
   It sounded like a good-faith offer, but in fact it was a trap.
Lott intended an accelerated schedule of treaty hearings,
culminating in a vote less than two weeks later.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, only partly aware of what was happening behind the
scenes in the Republican caucus, gave their unanimous consent to
Lott's timetable.
</P>
<P>
   ``It became difficult for the Democrats to say we can't do this,
we would have looked stupid demanding hearings, demanding a vote
and then complaining about the process. There's no moral victory in
that,'' said a Democratic legislative aide.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lott thought we'd turn down his offer,'' the aide continued,
``and so we were both locked into essentially a fight to the death,
like scorpions in a bottle.''
</P>
<P>
   The administration quickly recognized the noose Lott had slipped
around the president's neck. Privately, officials were furious with
Senate Democrats for putting the treaty at risk by baiting the
Republicans into calling a quick vote without adequate time to
gauge the sentiment of the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is the White House didn't see this coming,'' said a
senior administration official enlisted in the belated effort to
salvage the treaty.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question the administration wanted the treaty and
wanted it done right, but the precipitous rule giving us only 12
days to do it was based on taunting by the Senate Democrats and
they were free-lancing,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   The president and his top foreign policy advisers went all out
to try to win votes for the treaty. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright, Defense Secretary William Cohen and Gen. Henry Shelton,
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, all appeared on Capitol Hill
to lobby for the agreement. Clinton assembled former officials and
Nobel laureates at a White House pep rally to try to build support.
White House chief of staff John Podesta and Berger made dozens of
calls to Senators trying to find a face-saving way to delay the
vote.
</P>
<P>
   But it was a losing battle, and all seemed to know it.
</P>
<P>
   Albright on Tuesday telephoned Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan,
D-N.Y., and Sen. John Warner, R-Va., who together were trying to
fashion a compromise that would defer consideration of the treaty
indefinitely. The administration had grasped at that solution as
preferable to the treaty's being permanently rejected.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm feeling kind of helpless here,'' Albright told Moynihan,
according to an official who was privy to the conversation. ``What
can I do?''
</P>
<P>
   Not much, Moynihan replied, the Republicans have made up their
minds to take this thing down.
</P>
<P>
   The question was echoed by Clinton himself in a series of
belated phone calls to Republican senators as late as two hours
before the vote.
</P>
<P>
   And the answer was the same: It's too late.

ROCKER HELPS GET ATLANTA OUT OF ANOTHER TIGHT SPOT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ John Rocker is a man of habit. And during the
postseason, he has made a habit of getting batters out.
</P>
<P>
   More than 50 minutes after Wednesday's sparkling relief
performance, Rocker finally appeared in the Atlanta Braves'
clubhouse, having followed his ritual of working out after games.
Why should Rocker change his routine? He has been baseball's best
reliever during the postseason, a hard-throwing, highly emotional
left-hander who attacks batters and dares them to hit his best
stuff.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Rocker is winning the battles. During the eighth inning
of Wednesday's 4-3 victory in Game 2 of the division series against
the Mets, Rocker pitched his way out of another crucial jam.
</P>
<P>
   He entered the top of the eighth with one out, with the Braves
protecting their one-run lead and with Edgardo Alfonzo on second
base after a run-scoring double. The heart of the Mets' order was
coming up _ John Olerud, Mike Piazza and Robin Ventura _ and
Rocker's difficult mission was to keep Alfonzo from scoring, to
protect Atlanta's lead.
</P>
<P>
   Mission accomplished. First Rocker struck out Olerud, a fine
left-handed hitter who usually makes contact, even against
left-handers. Then after walking Piazza intentionally, Rocker
struck out Ventura, another left-hander, with a nasty slider,
ending the inning and bringing the partisan crowd at Turner Field
to its feet.
</P>
<P>
   John Smoltz retired the Mets in the ninth inning to earn the
save, but Rocker earned congratulations on another job well done.
He has saved both games as the Braves have taken a 2-0 lead over
the Mets in the best-of-7-game championship series, and in the
division series against the Houston Astros he escaped a
bases-loaded, nobody-out situation in the 10th inning of Game 3
without allowing a run, which proved to be the turning point of
that series.
</P>
<P>
   It has become an impressive formula for the Braves: get to the
late innings with a lead, then get Rocker in the game. Rocker has
made it look easy. But when it was over, Rocker, the star reliever,
admitted that he was relieved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys like Olerud and Ventura are veteran hitters who keep
making adjustments, and you never know what adjustments they'll
make,'' Rocker said. ``I'm playing a cat-and-mouse game with them,
changing my patterns. If Olerud guesses right and gets the pitch
he's looking for, it's almost a guaranteed base hit. But so far,
I've been fortunate.''
</P>
<P>
   Rocker has also been good, and his emergence as a dominant
pitcher could not have come at a better time for Atlanta. The
Braves lost their ace reliever, Kerry Ligtenberg, for the season
with an arm injury in spring training, opening the door for Rocker
to fill the void.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker responded by saving 38 games, one short of the team
record. And being a left-hander gives him an advantage in many
situations, such as Wednesday, when he overmatched the left-handers
Olerud and Ventura.
</P>
<P>
   ``Left-handed closers are rare, because if you have a
left-hander with that kind of stuff, you usually make a starter out
of him,'' said John Schuerholz, Atlanta's general manager. ``But we
don't need starting pitching. We needed a closer. When John was a
starter earlier in his career, there was nothing very special about
him. But he was a closer walking around in a starter's body. He not
only has the stuff to be a closer, he has the aggressive
mentality.''
</P>
<P>
   When Rocker runs hard from Atlanta's outfield bullpen to the
mound, the crowd explodes. And after Rocker ends a game, or escapes
a jam, he often celebrates outwardly, pumping his fist or
screaming. But his actions were subdued by his standards after
saving Game 1 on Tuesday and after Wednesday's eighth inning. What
gives?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to act like not quite such an idiot,'' Rocker
explained. ``And the game wasn't over. It would've looked silly to
do that, then see them come back and win 5-4 in the ninth.''
</P>
<P>
   Rocker wanted to pitch the ninth inning Wednesday, but he lost
his dugout debate with Manager Bobby Cox.
</P>
<P>
   ``I argued, but it's kind of pointless to argue with a manager
with his credentials,'' Rocker said.
</P>
<P>
   Leo Mazzone, Atlanta's respected pitching coach, sided with Cox.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want Rocker to pitch another 10 years,'' Mazzone said. ``We
protect arms around here.''
</P>
<P>
   Rocker warmed up before the ninth inning, then yielded to
Smoltz, leaving the game to a warm ovation. But when the series
resumes Friday at Shea Stadium, Mets fans will not be nearly as
friendly to Rocker.
</P>
<P>
   Was Rocker worried? What do you think?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tired act,'' he said of the Mets fans. ``I'd rather
pitch in front of a crowd that jeers than a crowd that cheers.''
</P>
<P>
   Rocker will get his wish this weekend. But so far in the
postseason, both home and away, Rocker has been having his way.

A DISAPPOINTED CLINTON SAYS THE FIGHT IS `FAR FROM OVER'
</HEADLINE>
   (With TEST-BAN-TREATY, TREATY-MISSTEPS, TREATY-ASSESS) 
(rk) 
 By DAVID STOUT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A grim-faced President Clinton said Wednesday night
that he was ``very disappointed'' over the Senate's rejection of
the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty but said the fight was ``far from
over.''
</P>
<P>
   Appearing on the White House lawn, the president attributed the
treaty's defeat to ``politics, pure and simple.'' He said the
treaty was critically important in preserving world peace, and that
it was ``well worth fighting for _ and I assure you, the fight is
far from over.''
</P>
<P>
   Many politicians involved in the battle have said that the
Senate's action Wednesday dooms any chances for the treaty to be
considered again for the rest of the Clinton presidency, and the
president did not elaborate on his promise that the fight would
continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never before has a serious treaty involving nuclear weapons
been handled in such a reckless and ultimately partisan way,'' the
president said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish we could have had a responsible alternative,'' he told
reporters. ``I worked until the 11th hour to achieve it,'' adding:
``I also encourage strongly countries that have not yet signed or
ratified this treaty to do so. And I will continue to press the
case that this treaty is in the interest of the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   Several countries had planned to follow the lead of the United
States in taking action on the treaty.
</P>
<P>
   He said the senators who rejected the treaty ``turned aside the
best advice of our top military leaders,'' and ``ignored the
conclusion of 32 Nobel Prize winners in physics, and many other
leading scientists.''
</P>
<P>
   The president went on to call the vote ``a political deal _ and
I hope it will get the treatment from the American people it richly
deserves.''
</P>
<P>
   And speaking thousands of miles away, Vice President Al Gore
pledged that if he was elected president, his first act would be to
work toward ratifying the treaty. Gore called the Senate's
rejection the fruit of ``right-wing extremists'' and said it was
``breathtakingly irresponsible.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to make this a campaign issue,'' he said in an
interview with National Public Radio shortly after he landed in
Seattle, on a flight from Los Angeles. ``And with the support of
the American people, I will make this pledge: My very first act as
president, if I have the support of the American people to become
president, my very first act will be to resubmit this treaty to the
Senate for ratification. And during this campaign, I want to do
everything I can to cultivate support for ratification.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore added: ``For somebody in the rest of the world who thinks
`Oh, gee, the United States has just gone off its rocker here and
come out in favor of opening up nuclear tests again,' no, that's
not what happened. A small, willful group of Republicans listened
to a tiny minority of right-wing extremists and took an action thatis contrary to what the American people feel.''
</P>
<P>
   He continued: ``So stay tuned, world. We are going to ratify a
treaty banning nuclear tests. It is only a matter of time.''

ISAAC GRAINGER, BANKER AND FORMER PRESIDENT OF USGA, DIES AT 104  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By AMY E. TURNBULL   
 c. 1999 The Morning Star, Wilmington, Del.   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILMINGTON, N.C. _ Isaac B. (Ike) Grainger, former president of
the U.S. Golf Association who was one of the country's leading
authorities on the rules of golf, died on Tuesday at his home in
Wilmington. He was 104.
</P>
<P>
   His nephew, Walker Taylor, recalled that a former USGA president
once told him that Grainger ``was the only person he knew who went
to sleep every night reading the rules of golf. And he did.''
</P>
<P>
   Grainger was also president of Chemical Bank from 1956 to 1960.
He was considered instrumental in developing the bank's retail
network. In 1996, Chemical Bank merged with Chase Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor said his uncle retired to Wilmington in the 1970s, but
maintained an office in New York until his death, conducting
business by calling his secretary several times a day. At the time
of his death, Grainger was a director of the Hartford Fire
Insurance Co. and Smith Barney Managed Funds and was an
adviser-director of the Union Electric Co. of St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   His business expertise, however, was probably overshadowed by
his knowledge of and devotion to the game of golf.
</P>
<P>
   Grainger was chairman of the USGA committee that in 1951
negotiated the first uniform code of rules with the Royal and
Ancient Golf Club of St. Andrews in Scotland, and reportedly
assisted President Dwight D. Eisenhower with his short game at the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   He was a chairman of the USGA rules committee and vice chairman
of the Augusta National Rules Committee.
</P>
<P>
   As president of the USGA, Grainger presented Arnold Palmer with
his first amateur champion cup in 1954. He also served as president
of the Metropolitan Golf Association and the U.S. Seniors' Golf
Association.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Wilmington in 1895, Grainger attended Woodberry Forest
School in Virginia and Princeton University in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   During World War I, he served on the home front as a captain of
infantry and as an instructor in officers training schools at Fort
Oglethorpe and Camp Gordon, both in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   He later held executive positions with the Murchison National
Bank in Wilmington, the North Carolina Bank and Trust Co. of
Greensboro and the Montclair Trust Co. in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   He joined Chemical Bank in 1943 and served as president from
1956 to 1960, when he reached mandatory retirement age.
</P>
<P>
   Grainger was widowed when his wife of 70 years, Catherine, died
in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   His survivors include two sons, Isaac B. Grainger Jr. of
Charlotte and John Victor Grainger of Wilmington.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995 (the centennial year for both the association and
Grainger), the USGA designated the Ike Grainger Award to recognize
people who have volunteered for the USGA for 25 years. &QL;

RHODE ISLAND SUES PAINT MAKERS OVER LEAD-POISONING HEALTH COSTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs 7th graf to give full DuPont name; adds insert after 89th
graf to give companies' response)  (bl) 
 By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Rhode Island attorney general sued eight paint manufacturers
and a lead industry trade group in state court Tuesday in an effort
to make them pay for treating children poisoned by lead paint and
removing lead paint from buildings.
</P>
<P>
   At least a dozen other states, counties and cities are
considering filing similar suits, as governments did earlier
against the tobacco and gun industries, and others are considering
suits, lawyers involved in the cases said.
</P>
<P>
   And as in the suits against cigarette makers, which led to
settlements with the states totaling $240 billion, lawyers for
Rhode Island are accusing paint manufacturers of knowing lead paint
was dangerous, especially to children, and of covering up the risk.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government banned lead paint in 1978 because of
health concerns, but studies this decade have found that two-thirds
of the nation's housing still contains lead paint, and that 890,000
children between 1 and 5 years old have elevated lead levels in
their blood. Ingesting paint chips or dust containing lead can
cause severe mental, developmental and behavioral problems,
including lowered intelligence, in children.
</P>
<P>
   High lead levels are more common in the older Northeast, where
many homes and buildings were constructed more than a generation
ago, when lead was a standard ingredient in paint. According to
Rhode Island officials, 20 percent of kindergarten students there
have elevated blood-lead levels.
</P>
<P>
   The Rhode Island suit accuses the eight companies, or companies
that they now own, of promoting the use of lead paint while
covering up the dangers it posed to children. The suit, filed by
Attorney General Sheldon Whitehouse, also names as a defendant the
Lead Industries Association, an industry trade group.
</P>
<P>
   The defendants are Atlantic Richfield Co. of Los Angeles; E.I.
duPont De Nemours &AMP; Co. of Wilmington, Del.; -Williams Co.
of Cleveland; and NL Industries Inc. of Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Also named were Glidden Co., a unit of Imperial Chemical
Industries PLC in England; O'Brien Corp., which was bought by ICI;
and SCM Chemicals Inc. and American Cyanamid Co., whose paint
liabilities were assumed by Cytec Industries Inc. of West Paterson,
N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of some of those companies said the lawsuit was
meritless and that they had always manufactured paint in a safe and
appropriate manner. Some compa- nies also said they had not
manufac- tured paint in years. Cytec Indus- tries Inc., which
acquired certain as- sets of American Cyanamid six years ago, said
it did not believe the company was ever a maker of made lead paint.
</P>
<P>
   A number of lawsuits against lead manufacturers by individual
plaintiffs have failed in the past. But the Rhode Island lawsuit
seeks a different remedy, following the path of state lawsuits
against the tobacco industry, which ended in settlements totaling
more than $240 billion.
</P>
<P>
   As in those cases, which sought to recoup the costs of treating
smoking-related illnesses, Rhode Island is seeking reimbursement of
money spent on the health costs of lead paint, not money to
compensate individual victims.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers pressing the new cases also plan to harness the same
financial resources used to pay for the tobacco litigation, as at
least three lawyers who played major roles and won huge fee awards
in suits against tobacco will be involved in lead-paint cases. The
Rhode Island attorney general said the plaintiffs' lawyers would
receive about 17 percent of any verdict or settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Lead industry officials called the lawsuit a ``groundless and
wasteful action'' and said that past lawsuits alleging industrywide
conspiracies have failed. ``This is litigation that is trying to
make a scapegoat of responsible companies,'' said Timothy Hardy, a
lawyer representing NL Industries, one of the defendants in the
Rhode Island suit. ``The story the plaintiff lawyers are trying to
tell is wrong.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Jeff Miller, executive director of the Lead Industries
Association, said he had not seen the lawsuit and could not comment
on its specifics. But he said blood-lead levels have been falling
for years, in part because the industry quit selling lead paint in
the early 1960s. ``Most kids are way below any medical level of
concern,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Motley, a key lawyer in the state tobacco lawsuits, whose
firm filed the Rhode Island lead-paint suit, said he believed that
documents he has show that the industry covered up the dangers of
lead paint, much as tobacco executives hid the dangers of smoking.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were as omnipresent and evil as the tobacco industry ever
hoped to be,'' Motley said. ``This is not a teenage problem. This
is a toddler problem. The tobacco industry targeted teenagers, but
at least teenagers could read. You're talking about poisoning
children with an odorless, colorless but tasty thing. It's
insidious.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for New York City Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said
the city is looking at possibly suing lead paint manufacturers but
that no decision has been made. A spokesman for New York State
Attorney General Eliot Spitzer said he was not aware of any
imminent plans to file a suit against the industry.
</P>
<P>
   The Rhode Island lawyers will seek to contrast advertisements
and statements by manufacturers that lead is not harmful with
internal and other documents that they contend demonstrate the
industry knew of serious health risks but lied about them and
sought to delay increased labeling and disclosure.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Subpoenas to the defendants will begin going out this week,
lawyers said. But they already have obtained some documents that
they say support their accusations, with industry officials
dismissing concerns about poisoning as a problem faced largely by
``slum children,'' while also showing that they knew more than 50
years ago that lead was toxic and lead paint dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   One document, from the Lead Industries Association's 1959 annual
report, comments that lead poisoning, or the threat of it, ``means
thousands of items of unfavorable publicity every year. This is
particularly true since most cases of lead poisoning today are in
children, and anything sad that happens to a child is meat for
newspaper editors and is gobbled up by the public. It makes no
difference that it is essentially a problem of slums, a public
welfare problem. Just the same, the publicity hits us where it
hurts.''
</P>
<P>
   And, according to the lawsuit, the association's director of
health and safety informed members in 1955 that ``childhood lead
poisoning is common enough to constitute perhaps my major
`headache,' this being in part due to the very poor prognosis in
many such cases, and also to the fact that the only real remedy
lies in educating a relatively ineducable category of parents. It
is mainly a slum problem with us,'' the lawsuits quotes document as
stating, adding that ``we have no monopoly on either substandard
housing or substandard mentalities in the U.S.A.''
</P>
<P>
   Hardy, the lawyer for NL Industries, said these documents have
been introduced into courts before, and yet no judge or jury has
ruled against the manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   Don Ryan, executive director of the Alliance to End Childhood
Lead Poisoning, a public interest group in Washington, said lead
poisoning has long been a more severe problem in lower-income
areas. But he said it also afflicts affluent areas, especially when
renovations cause the release of lead-paint dust.
</P>
<P>
   Some problems happen because of ``the inadvertent creation of
hazards at the other end of the economic spectrum, yuppies fixing
up the grand old Victorian,'' Ryan said. He estimates it would cost
$500 billion to remove all the paint in the nation's dwellings.
</P>
<P>
   The lead-paint lawsuits will be a reunion of sorts for some of
the most important lawyers involved in the state tobacco
settlements.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from Motley, whose Charleston, S.C., firm, Ness, Motley,
Loadholdt Richardson &AMP; Poole, represented 28 states in the tobacco
litigation, Baltimore Orioles owner Peter Angelos, another
prominent anti-tobacco plaintiff lawyer, filed two cases against
lead paint manufacturers in September in Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   And Richard Scruggs, a Pascagoula, Miss., lawyer who also was
instrumental in the tobacco litigation, is expected to play a part
in at least a few lead paint lawsuits in the Southeast. Scruggs
said Wednesday he may not become involved at the same national
scope as he was with tobacco, due to the press of other cases,
including recent litigation against HMOs. But he said ``in some
selected cases, I'm sure we'll be with them.''

HARPER SIGNS; ROSTER IS CROWDED

<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ In a move anticipated for months, Ron Harper
became a Laker on Wednesday. His arrival will have consequences up
and down the Lakers roster.
</P>
<P>
   The former Chicago Bull and favorite of Lakers coach Phil
Jackson signed a two-year, $4.2 million contract and is expected to
join the team today.
</P>
<P>
   Harper, a 6-6 guard, will be the 19th player in uniform, and the
12th with a guaranteed contract, implying that the roster could be
set (NBA teams are limited to a dozen players, with up to three
more on the injured list).
</P>
<P>
   But the Lakers' situation is more complicated than that, and
guaranteed deals might not translate into guaranteed jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Among the seven players with nonguaranteed contracts are Benoit
Benjamin and John Salley. At least one of them is expected to make
the team because of the Lakers' need for big men. Someone else will
be pushed aside.
</P>
<P>
   ``But nothing appears as it seems, you know,'' Jackson said
earlier this week. ``And that's the way about life, is that
everything just kind of changes. This is going to change. Our
roster is going to take some changes during the course of the year.
And we're going to explore with it, see how we are.''
</P>
<P>
   Harper's arrival probably forces second-round pick John
Celestand, a guard, onto the injured list or waiver wire. Even
second-year guards Tyronn Lue and Sam Jacobson, who each have
guaranteed deals for two more seasons, don't appear secure.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, some of the long shots are likely to be cut soon.
Jackson almost made cuts Monday, the last day of training camp, but
decided to take everyone on the Lakers' two-day exhibition road
trip.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson wants his roster finalized before the last exhibition
game, Oct. 28.
</P>
<P>
   The 35-year-old Harper played the last five seasons for the
Bulls, four of them under Jackson, winning three NBA championships.
A strong defender, he can play either guard position and is
proficient in Jackson's triangle offense. He averaged 11.2 points,
5.1 rebounds and 3.3 assists last season.
</P>
<P>
   The 13-year veteran was drafted by Cleveland and played
four-plus seasons for the Clippers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy to be here and happy to be a part of this great team
that is hopefully going to be even greater very soon,'' Harper
said.
   Dribbles: The Lakers hope to reschedule Tuesday's canceled
exhibition game and have not ruled out returning to Little Rock,
Ark., to do it. The game was called off because of structural
problems at the new Alltel Arena. If the arena remains unavailable,
the Lakers will try to play the game elsewhere in order to maintain
a full slate of exhibition games.... Expect the Lakers to wear a
patch or some other symbol to honor the late Wilt Chamberlain this
season. The team must obtain league approval before adding anything
to its uniforms. A ceremony of some kind is also possible when the
Lakers host a two-day exhibition tournament at the Forum on Oct.
21-22.

FRANK FROST, WHO PLAYED DELTA BLUES ON THE HARMONICA, DIES AT 63  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ark., Mo., Miss., Tenn.)   By NEIL STRAUSS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Frank Frost, one of the foremost Delta blues harmonica players
of his generation, died on Tuesday at his home on the street named
in his honor in Helena, Ark. He was 63.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cardiac arrest, said Otha Bush, deputy coroner of
Phillips County, Ark.
</P>
<P>
   Born Frank Otis Frost in Auvergne, Ark., Frost moved to St.
Louis when he was 15 and began his musical career as a guitarist.
He toured in 1954 with the drummer Sam Carr and Carr's father,
Robert Nighthawk. Soon after, he spent several years touring with
Sonny Boy Williamson, who helped teach him to play harmonica. After
a hand injury, Frost turned his attention to the harmonica and
piano.
</P>
<P>
   He moved with Carr to the Mississippi Delta around 1960, and
after he played a show with the guitarist Big Jack Johnson, they
added him to their group. Together they attracted the interest of
the producer and record-label owner Sam Phillips, who years earlier
had overseen Elvis Presley's first recording sessions. He produced
the first album by Frank Frost with the Night Hawks, ``Hey Boss
Man,'' for his Phillips International label in 1962, with shuffling
blues hybrids like ``Frank's Jump'' showing off Frost's dynamically
diverse, intensely melodic harmonica solos. Presley's guitarist,
Scotty Moore, produced Frost's next album in Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   In the late '70s Frost, working as a school janitor, was
rediscovered by a blues enthusiast, Michael Frank, who began
releasing albums on his Earwig label by the trio, now called the
Jelly Roll Kings after a song from ``Hey Boss Man.''
</P>
<P>
   Cigarettes and alcohol wore Frost down over the years, but he
continued to record, tour and diversify his repertory, appearing in
the films ``Deep Blues'' and ``Crossroads.'' Most recently he
released an album titled ``The Jelly Roll Kings'' with Carr on
Hightone.
</P>
<P>
   He made an appearance on Friday at the King Biscuit Blues
Festival in Helena, where he was brought onstage in a wheelchair
during a set by Carr and given a harmonica, which he had trouble
playing. Carr, said one of his bandmates, had tears in his eyes as
he performed.
</P>
<P>
   Frost is survived by a brother, Theo, and a sister, Francis, of
St. Louis, and several children. &QL;

FIXING THINGS UP IN ALABAMA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ If you have any doubts about the influence a
college football program can have when it dominates a state, here's
this week's cautionary tale, courtesy of Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   With the state holding a vote Tuesday on instituting a state
lottery (it lost), someone ``removed'' a file from the office of
interim director of public safety, Col. Mike Sullivan.
</P>
<P>
   The file contained information regarding speeding tickets that
had been ``fixed,'' or dropped, on Sullivan's recommendation.
</P>
<P>
   Among those who had received favors: the wife of Alabama Gov.
Don Seigleman, several judges and state legislators, the proposed
director of the lottery, and, of course, several members of the
University of Alabama athletic department.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan, a 33-year veteran of the state troopers, was one of
the Crimson Tide's sideline escorts for many years.
</P>
<P>
   Most notable among those who'd had tickets fixed were senior
wide receiver Shamari Buchanan, the only active player whose named
turned up.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan was suspended for the Florida game pending
investigation of the allegations by embarrassed Alabama officials.
The favor could be construed as an NCAA violation under the ``extra
benefits'' rule, and the school was appealing his suspension, based
on his one-game suspension and his paying the proper amount of
fines for the speeding ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Also caught in the report were Alabama linebackers coach Jeff
Rouzie, former assistant and current associate athletic director
Mal Moore, and Alabama athletic ticket manager Rhoda Vaughn, who
also allegedly had a ticket fixed for her nephew.
</P>
<P>
   While `fixing' tickets is illegal, it is not considered an NCAA
violation when done for coaches or administrators.
</P>
<P>
   But almost worse than the ticket-fixing was the reaction of
Rouzie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to lie about it,'' he said. ``It's like paying
taxes _ you don't want to pay any more than you have to. It (ticket
fixing) has been going on around here since the 1970s, and probably
at every other place you can think of.''
</P>
<P>
   If that wasn't enough, that great moral authority, Alabama head
coach Mike DuBose, dismissed the investigation as ridiculous.
</P>
<P>
   ``I imagine if you check the world, there's people all over the
world (doing it),'' DuBose said. ``I think it's silly.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the worst rationalization since Cade McNown tried to
weasel his way out of the UCLA handicapped parking scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Crossing the T: The orange ``T'' painted on the Neyland Stadium
field stood for more than Tennessee last Saturday night. It stood
for ``Ticked.''
</P>
<P>
   The Vols were not amused after Georgia's players gathered in the
middle of the field during warmups, danced on the Vols' emblem and
kicked at the turf.
</P>
<P>
   Linebacker Raynoch Thompson delivered a pregame talk to several
teammates in the locker room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told everybody, `Georgia can't come in our house and do
that,''' Thompson said after Tennessee's 37-20 victory. ``They were
living off false emotion.''
</P>
<P>
   Defensive back Fred White of Griffin, Ga., also said the
Bulldogs got under the Vols' skin by ``getting in our faces before
the game. They disrespected us. We had to come out and show they
have to respect us.''
</P>
<P>
   No change: Cal coach Tom Holmoe elevated true freshman Kyle
Boller to the starting quarterback spot three weeks ago, and the
coach is sticking with him.
</P>
<P>
   The Hart High graduate was 11 for 33 Saturday against BYU for
173 yards with one touchdown and one interception. At one point, he
was 1 for 11 for 5 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Holmoe said he didn't replace Boller _ and doesn't plan to _
with Samuel Clemons because, ``I don't want to start a Ping-Pong
match.''
</P>
<P>
   Futile conference: The Associated Press in New York said it
believes (as best it could tell) that this is the first time the
Pacific-10 Conference has not had even one team in the polls since
Oct. 6, 1985 (it was the Top 20 then).
</P>
<P>
   For what it's worth, the last time the league didn't have a
single team ranked in the final AP poll of the season was 1963,
when only 10 teams were ranked by the organization.
</P>
<P>
   Mascot bashing: Middle Tennessee's hardest hit of the night
against Arkansas came before the game when the team stampeded the
fighting Razorback mascot while taking the field.
</P>
<P>
   Brad Lynch, who wears the Razorback costume, said he did not
realize he had wandered so close to the visitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty hard to see wearing this,'' Lynch said, referring
to the big Razorback head. ``I didn't see (the Blue Raiders).
</P>
<P>
   ``One of their guys really lowered his shoulder into me. They
were laughing about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynch, who was examined by a trainer, suffered a cut above his
eye but returned to cheer.
</P>
<P>
   Go Terps: Maryland is in position to play in its first bowl game
since 1990 after a 4-1 start. The Terrapins won 17-14 at Wake
Forest, their first ACC road victory over a team other than Duke
since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Maryland has not won more than six games in a season since 1985,
the year the Terps captured their last ACC title with a 6-0 league
record. Ahead on the schedule are Duke, North Carolina, N.C. State
and Virginia. &QL;

ANALYSIS: THE MOST SIGNIFICANT TREATY REJECTION SINCE VERSAILLES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs 6th graf to change `Duma' to `Parliament'; subs 10th graf to
clarify India-Pakistan situation)  (With TEST-BAN-TREATY) 
(bl) 
 By R.W. APPLE Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate's decisive rejection of the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty on Wednesday night was the most
explicit U.S. repudiation of a major international agreement in
almost 80 years, and it further weakened the already shaky standing
of the United States as a global moral leader.
</P>
<P>
   Not since the Versailles Treaty was voted down in November 1919,
an action that was repeated in March 1920, has so far-reaching an
accord been turned down. In the entire history of the Republic, the
Senate has rejected only 20 treaties negotiated by U.S. presidents
or other officials, while it has approved 1,523.
</P>
<P>
   By torpedoing a face-saving compromise that had been tentatively
agreed upon by the White House and the Republican leadership,
conservative Republicans made a vote inevitable. And by denying the
treaty not only the requisite two-third majority but even a simple
majority, the conservatives and their allies made good on a promise
by Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., to give the agreement a Capitol Hill
``funeral.''
</P>
<P>
   The control of nuclear weapons, perfected in the final days of
World War II, has been a central goal of U.S. foreign policy since
President Dwight D. Eisenhower proposed a ban on all nuclear
testing in 1958. All eight presidents in the four decades since _
Republicans and Democrats, liberals and conservatives _ have sought
in some way to limit testing and weapons development.
</P>
<P>
   In rejecting the test ban treaty, which President Clinton signed
on Sept. 24, 1996, at a ceremony at the United Nations, the Senate
halted the momentum built up over the years. No modern arms-control
treaty had ever been rejected, although President Jimmy Carter, who
had a hard time winning passage of the Panama Canal treaties,
withdrew the SALT II agreement with the Soviet Union from
consideration after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in late
1979.
</P>
<P>
   The SALT agreement was finally ratified in 1996, when memories
of Afghanistan had faded, but the Russian Parliament has never
acted upon it.
</P>
<P>
   The treaty rejected Wednesday night was to have been the
capstone of arms-control efforts, banning even nuclear tests
conducted underground.
</P>
<P>
   Only last week, an international conference in Vienna urged the
United States, Russia and China, all of which had signed the global
agreement without formally ratifying it, to accelerate approval as
a means of bringing renewed pressure on North Korea, India and
Pakistan. They are the only three of the world's 44 nuclear-capable
nations that have not signed the pact.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday of this week, a spokesman for the Chinese foreign
ministry urged U.S. ratification, arguing that it would ``serve as
an example and promote the ratification of the treaty by other
countries.''
</P>
<P>
   North Korea has not stated its intentions clearly. India and
Pakistan are still trying to decide whether to sign, although the
military coup in Pakistan this week has raised doubts.
</P>
<P>
   The 15 nations that have signed but not ratified the accord now
have far less incentive to ratify. In addition to Russia and China,
Egypt and Israel are on that list. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright said in a speech in Maine on Wednesday that the United
States would continue to observe the terms of the treaty,
conducting no nuclear testing, and urge other nations to do the
same.
</P>
<P>
   But the whole point of the treaty was to make such undertakings
legally binding, not voluntary, and that now seems unachievable.
Ratification by all 44 countries is required for the agreement to
take effect.
</P>
<P>
   So the United States finds itself in the position of the
spoiler, at a time when it is already stigmatized as a nation that
refuses to pay its dues to the United Nations and, in some
quarters, as a nation that takes part in international
peace-keeping and other such efforts only reluctantly, only in some
parts of the world and only when its own ox is being gored.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For Clinton, whose influence abroad is waning, perhaps more than
that of the typical president approaching his final year in office,
the treaty's rejection was the latest in a series of difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   It took place against a backdrop of intense partisan and
ideological polarization between the White House and Congress,
which Clinton was unable to neutralize with the finesse he often
displays on domestic issues. Such polarization also played a key
role in the defeat of the Versailles Treaty, which came after t the
end of World War I, the most popular war the United States had ever
fought up to then.
</P>
<P>
   President Woodrow Wilson, a Democrat, invited neither Republican
leaders nor important senators to Paris for the peace talks,
telling associates that the Republicans, who had taken control of
both houses of Congress in the 1918 elections, would never dare to
refuse ratification. Compounding his error, Wilson refused to
compromise with Sen. Henry Cabot Lodge, R-Mass., chairman of the
Foreign Relations Committee and leader of the opposition to the
Versailles Treaty and the League of Nations, which was set up by a
covenant within the treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Lodge and many other Republicans intensely disliked Wilson, and
that contributed to the defeat, just as the enmity of Helms, the
current chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, and others
towards Clinton contributed to the rejection of the test ban
treaty. But in 1919 and 1920, unlike today, there was a passionate,
detailed debate about the treaty on both sides of the Atlantic,
with leading thinkers joining in attacks on the treaty.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the great British economist John Maynard Keynes
condemned Wilson as ``a blind and deaf Don Quixote'' who had been
``bamboozled'' by the more sophisticated Europeans. But the debate
on the test ban treaty has been brief and muted, with opponents
relying on generalized assertions that the accord would harm U.S.
national security by unwisely limiting sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   Because it never joined the League of Nations, the United States
was unable to play a role in the League's attempts to head off the
approach of World War II in places like Ethiopia, then called
Abyssinia, and that inevitably weakened the League's peace efforts.
</P>
<P>
   After the defeat of the Versailles Treaty and before Wednesday,
only five other treaty agreements had been rejected by the Senate.
U.S. adherence to the World Court, an arm of the League of Nations,
was one of the most important of the issues involved; it was turned
aside in January 1935, with 20 Democrats forsaking President
Franklin D. Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
   Described as a historic setback at the time, it proved to be
much less than that, as the influence of the World Court crumbled
in Europe's rush towards war. U.S. adherence would have made little
difference.
</P>
<P>
   The St. Lawrence Seaway project was blocked a year earlier, but
it was of course built after World War II. A commercial rights
treaty with Turkey was voted down in 1927. More recently, a
protocol of the Law of the Sea treaty regarding the compulsory
settlement of disputes was rejected (though not the treaty itself),
as was an obscure Montreal aviation protocol.
</P>
<P>
   But none of those actions had anything approaching the gravity
of Wednesday night's rejection, which went to the very heart of the
efforts by the victorious allies to build a safer world in the wake
of World War II.

APPLE REPORTS POSITIVE FOURTH QUARTER RESULTS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ After warning last month of an earnings
shortfall, Apple Computer Inc. Wednesday reported results for its
fourth quarter that exceeded Wall Street analysts' revised
estimates. Apple executives also predicted strong sales for the
December quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Apple said it had been able to ship only 6,000 of its new iBook
laptops, which were announced in July, because of production delays
caused by the Taiwan earthquake. Apple executives said they
expected no material impact from the earthquake in the December
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Apple also said that IBM Corp. would begin manufacturing its
high-end G4 microprocessor next year, alleviating supply problems
that held back sales during the quarter. Motorola, which has been
the sole supplier of the chip, was not able to raise production
rapidly enough to meet the demand for Apple's new G4 Power
Macintosh. The G4 is the latest version of the Power PC
microprocessor co-developed by Apple, IBM and Motorola.
</P>
<P>
   Apple reported its results after the market's close. In Nasdaq
trading, Apple shares closed at $64.03125, down $3.65625, but they
gained as much as $4 in after-hours trading.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they squeaked out of the quarter pretty well, and have
set themselves up for just tremendous performance now through the
end of the year,'' said Lou Mazzucchelli, an analyst with Gerard
Klauer Mattison. Noting that growth in orders was accelerating, he
added: ``The company's profile has been elevating, and people feel
safer buying these things. That's a very powerful long-term
trend.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Motorola has been unable to supply the fastest versions
of the G4, Apple said it had rered the Power Mac computers
using the chip. They will now ship in speeds of 350, 400 and 450
megahertz, each 50 megahertz slower than originally announced, but
with no reduction in prices. The 500-megahertz version will now not
be available until after the first of the year.
</P>
<P>
   For the quarter ended Sept. 25, Apple reported earnings of $111
million, or 63 cents a diluted share, up 5 percent from $106
million, or 68 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. Sales
fell 14 percent, to $1.35 billion, from $1.56 billion in the fourth
quarter of fiscal 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Fourth-quarter 1999 earnings include a $21 million positive
impact from nonrecurring items, including an after-tax gain of $37
million from the sale of approximately three million shares of ARM
Holdings PLC, and a reorganization charge of $16 million for
contract cancellation charges related to previously outsourced
services and a discontinued business. Without these nonrecurring
items, Apple's earnings for the quarter would have been $90
million,cents a diluted share.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts had expected Apple to earn 45 cents a share, according
to First Call/Thomson Financial. Before Apple's warning last month,
the consensus estimate was 76 cents.
</P>
<P>
   That would have been reachable but for the limited availability
of microprocessors, Steven P. Jobs, Apple's interim chief
executive, said in a telephone interview. ``If we'd have gotten the
G4 chips that had been promised us, we'd have been fine,'' he said.
``We're back on track now. We have no production constraints on
Powerbooks, G4s or the new iMac, and we're coming up to speed very
quickly on iBooks.''
</P>
<P>
   In a conference call with securities analysts, Fred Anderson,
Apple's chief financial officer, said Apple had orders for 200,000
iBooks but had only been able to ship 6,000 units in the quarter.
He said it had orders for 150,000 G4 PowerMac's, but had only
shipped 64,000. The company ended the quarter with a backlog of
400,000 units, equivalent to $700 million in unrealized revenue, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Apple announced three new versions of its popular
iMac, including two with the ability to edit digital movies, and it
has already received more than 250,000 orders, Anderson said. These
machines are not included in the backlog number.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect to catch up on G4 Power Macs by the end of the
December quarter, but will remain constrained on iBooks,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   With all four product lines shipping in the December quarter,
Anderson said he expected sales to exceed the fourth fiscal quarter
and the corresponding quarter a year earlier. But he said gross
profit margins would probably drop a point or two from the 28.7
percent reported in the fourth quarter, primarily because a greater
percentage of total sales would be lower-margin consumer machines
and because of higher costs for memory chips. These negative
impacts will be partly offset by the release of Mac OS9, the latest
version of Apple's operating system, which begins shipping this
month.
</P>
<P>
   For the year, Apple reported earnings of $601 million, or $3.61
a diluted share, nearly twice the $309 million, or $2.10 a diluted
share, it reported in fiscal 1998. Revenues rose 3 percent, to $6.1
billion, from $5.9 billion in the prior year.

 MARTIN BARTNER, PUBLISHER OF THE STAR-LEDGER, DIES AT 69  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By NICK RAVO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Martin Bartner, a former high school sports stringer who became
publisher of The Star-Ledger of Newark, N.J., and helped build the
newspaper into the largest in the state, died Sunday at his home in
Verona, N.J. He was 69.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of death was prostate cancer, said Donald E. Newhouse,
president of the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   During his 46-year career, Bartner, along with the paper's
editor, Mort Pye, who died in 1997, saw The Star-Ledger, once a
small, weak, local daily, grow into a successful regional
publication with a daily circulation of 406,000 and a Sunday
circulation of 606,000, up from 200,000 in the late 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   Bartner was born April 11, 1930, in Newark. He started his
career at The Star-Ledger as a high school student, phoning in
sports scores for 10 cents a printed inch, according to the paper's
obituary.
</P>
<P>
   He attended New York University and returned to the newspaper
after graduation. In 1955, after two years in the army, he moved to
business posts at The Jersey Journal in Jersey City. In 1965, he
returned to The Star-Ledger as classified manager. In 1972, the
newspaper's once-vaunted competitor, The Newark News, went out of
business. Bartner and Pye expanded and improved the newspaper's
business and editorial staffs, helping the paper create a statewide
identity.
</P>
<P>
   Bartner was The Star-Ledger's director of advertising before
becoming associate publisher in 1980 and publisher in 1988. He
learned he had cancer two years ago, but remained in his job up to
his death.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Audrey; a son, Douglas Bartner of
Manhattan; a daughter, Lisa Coleman of Madison, N.J., and three
grandchildren.

TIME WARNER SAYS RESULTS SHOW STRONG REBOUND 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ALEX KUCZYNSKI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Time Warner Inc. said Wednesday that it earned $369
million in the third quarter, with the cable, cable networks and
publishing divisions posting substantial gains while the music and
filmed entertainment divisions showed losses.
</P>
<P>
   Net income per diluted share was 27 cents, in contrast to a loss
of 3 cents a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner's combined cash flow _ earnings before interest,
taxes and amortization _ for the period was $1.6 billion, up 49
percent from $1.08 billion a year earlier. Revenue grew 3 percent,
to $6.71 billion, from $6.59 billion for the same period in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Leibowitz, a senior vice president at Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP;
Jenrette, said that the report had no surprises. ``The expectations
had been lowered because of a recent downturn in the music
business, which showed a pretty big decline,'' he said. ``But
everything else was pretty much in line with their expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner's stock closed Wednesday at $62.625, down $1.25, on
the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner chairman and chief executive Gerald Levin said
Wednesday in meetings with analysts and reporters that he expected
the company's overall growth rate for 1999 to be similar to that of
1998, about 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The earnings at the cable networks grew 21 percent, to $328
million, in the third quarter; part of that growth was driven by
double-digit growth at Turner Cable Networks and HBO. Time Warner
Cable posted record earnings of $894 million, up from $417 million
a year earlier, reflecting an increase in basic cable, advertising
and pay-per-view revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Levin cited the People group as the most dynamic producer of new
products at Time Inc., the company's publishing division, where
earnings rose 15 percent to $129 million. He said Teen People, a
magazine founded in early 1998, will be profitable by the beginning
of the new year.
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting with reporters, Levin said he was disappointed in
the music division, the Warner Music Group, which posted
third-quarter earnings of $76 million before interest, taxes and
amortization, down from $99 million in the third quarter the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Music was off and will be down for the year,'' Levin said, but
he added that the replacement of the former management team, Robert
Daly and Terry Semel _ whose primary duties included overseeing the
Warner Brothers film studio _ with Roger Ames would bolster the
division's productivity.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner president Richard Parsons said the music industry
had been affected by adverse economic conditions in Japan, Germany
and Brazil, three of the five major international music markets.
Levin said that the music division experienced ``some slippage''
this year, but that was also partly because the division's major
performers _ among them Madonna, Alanis Morrissette and Jewel _ did
not produce any albums this year. ``Not enough of our big horses
were out there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Third-quarter earnings for the filmed entertainment division
were down slightly, to $228 million, from $233 million in the third
quarter of 1998. But earnings for the first nine months of 1999
were up to $806 million, versus $497 a year earlier. Revenue at the
Turner Broadcast Networks filmed entertainment division declined
because of the absence of revenue included in the previous year
from the syndication of ``Seinfeld.''
</P>
<P>
   Theatrical revenue benefited from the domestic box-office
results of New Line Cinema's ``Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged
Me'' which earned $205 million, and the worldwide box-office
revenue for ``The Matrix,'' which has earned $418 million.
</P>
<P>
   The WB Television Network lost $24 million in the third quarter,
which compared with a loss of $17 million for the third quarter in
1998. The network has lost $95 million in 1999, large part because
of the cost of expanded programming; analysts said that was to be
expected. ``The WB added another night of programming and the
ratings have been pretty good,'' Leibowitz of Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP;
Jenrette said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though the WB is losing money now, if you are trying to
reach the teen-age demographic, there is no better place to be,''
Levin said, adding that he expected to see advertising revenue rise
in the next year.

DE NIRO GROUP REPLACED AS DEVELOPERS OF FILM STUDIO IN BROOKLYN  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.J., Calif.)   By TERRY PRISTIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Five months after it was announced with fanfare, a
tentative deal calling for the actor Robert De Niro and Miramax
Films to develop a $150-million Hollywood-style sound stage complex
at the Brooklyn Navy Yard has collapsed, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the mayor said the project would go forward, with the
sound stages to be built by a group headed by Douglas C. Steiner,
the son of David S. Steiner, a New Jersey financier who is
prominent in political and Jewish causes. Their company, Steiner
Equities, will provide much of the financial backing for two
entrepreneurs, Louis Madigan and Cary Dean Hart, who signed a
contract with the city in 1998 to build the sound stages but were
brushed aside when De Niro and his partners became involved.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Douglas Steiner and his partners signed a 70-year
lease with Brooklyn Navy Yard Development Corp.,asi-public
agency that manages the former shipbuilding site, Marc H.
Rosenbaum, the agency's president, said Wednesday. Their team, New
York Studios, has $90 million in financing, enough to begin
construction, Rosenbaum and Steiner said. Steiner Equities is
putting up $35 million of that, Rosenbaum said.
</P>
<P>
   Calling the New York Studios proposal ``a much better deal for
the city,'' Giuliani said that the plans with De Niro's company,
TriBeCa Productions, and his partner, Steven Roth, the chairman of
Vornado Realty Trust, were abandoned for legal, financial and
practical reasons. The city's decision was first d Wednesday
by Bloomberg News Service and New York 1 News.
</P>
<P>
   New York Studios had threatened to sue the city if De Niro's
team prevailed, and that could have tied up the project for a long
time, even if the city ultimately won, officials said. While the
TriBeCa deal would have required the city to put up $25 million,
the rival group has not asked for a similar subsidy. Under the
Steiner proposal, the city would get at least $63 million more in
revenue during the first 40 years of the contract, Rosenbaum said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked by reporters why the plans with De Niro had been unveiled
with so much hoopla, including the actor's presence, Giuliani said
that the press release for that event had emphasized that the idea
was being explored.
</P>
<P>
   ``The press release says `explore' at least three times, so it
was explored,'' the mayor said. ``That's what the word means. It
doesn't mean `agreement.' It doesn't mean `deal.'''
</P>
<P>
   But the press release also quoted Giuliani as saying, ``This is
great news for New York City's booming film and television
industry.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposed deal with De Niro and his partners was greeted with
skepticism in some quarters because the team had yet to raise $80
million at a time when there was a surplus of sound stages in
Hollywood and the movie industry itself _ including the Walt Disney
Co., Miramax's parent _ was not in good financial shape. Even
people who operate sound stages say it is tough to make money
because production companies cannot usually make long-term
commitments.
</P>
<P>
   Some in the entertainment industry said that it might be even
tougher for inexperienced entrepreneurs. Madigan is a computer
consultant and Hart is a set designer.
</P>
<P>
   But Rosenbaum, of the Brooklyn Navy Yard, dismissed those
concerns, saying that film companies using the site for location
shooting routinely complained about a shortage of modern sound
stages. He said the city wanted to meet the demand without
incurring any further delays.
</P>
<P>
   Steiner said his team planned to build 11 sound stages _ one
fewer than the rival group had proposed _ ranging in size from
12,000 to 40,000 square feet. He estimated the cost of the project
at $90 million to $120 million and said he hoped that TriBeCa
Productions, Miramax and Vornado would eventually agree to join
forces with New York Studios venture. ``But we're prepared to go it
alone,'' he said. He said construction could begin in six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   TriBeCa and its partners declined to comment on the city's
decision. But one associate of the partners with intimate knowledge
of the negotiations said that De Niro and Harvey Weinstein, the
co-chairman of Miramax, had been committed to the Navy Yard project
and were baffled by the way the city had treated them. He said
there was no chance that the De Niro-Weinstein group would join the
rival team.
</P>
<P>
   There was some speculation Wednesday that politics had played a
role in the city's decision. This summer, Weinstein, a staunch
supporter of Hillary Rodham Clinton, Giuliani's potential rival in
next year's Senate race, had to hold the celebratory party for his
new magazine, Talk, at the Statue of Liberty after the city refused
to allow him the use of the Navy Yard.
</P>
<P>
   David Steiner and his wife, Sylvia, have contributed thousands
of dollars to Giuliani's campaigns. But over the last five years,
Steiner has contributed more than $700,000 to the Democratic Party
and many Democratic candidates. In July, he attended a White House
dinner for Ehud Barak, the prime minister of Israel, and sMrs. Clinton's table.

MRS. CLINTON TAKES MIDDLE GROUND: SHE ROOTS FOR SUBWAY SERIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARMONK, N.Y. _ The New York Mets were battling for the National
League pennant in Atlanta. The New York Yankees were going up
against the Boston Red Sox in the Bronx. And Hillary Rodham Clinton
was here in Westchester County Wednesday for a news conference
devoted to epidemiology, when what is arguably the most difficult
question any candidate in New York could confront this fall whizzed
toward her head:
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees or the Mets?
</P>
<P>
   The answer, it seems, is both.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am for a Subway Series!'' the first lady, who is a probable
candidate for the U.S. Senate, declared. ``I can state that without
fear of any contradiction. I think it would be great for New York
and hope it comes to pass.''
</P>
<P>
   With that, Mrs. Clinton's press secretary, Howard Wolfson,
stepped in with a polite, if firm, `'Thank you,'' and drew the news
conference to a hasty close.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady, whose hometown is Chicago, had been asked the
question back in July, when the notion of a Mets-Yankees World
Series senciful. At the time, Mrs. Clinton sidestepped it,
saying that _ no matter her inexperience in running for office _
she was smart enough not to take sides in such a hypothetical
dispute. This took place after she had plopped a Yankee cap on her
head during a White House ceremony, which struck even her friends
as politically inartful.
</P>
<P>
   But baseball times have changed. Mrs. Clinton's likely
Republican opponent, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, is a vigorous Yankee
fan, and, inevitably, was headed to Yankee Stadium for Wednesday
night's game. And with her answer, it seems safe to say that Mrs.
Clinton may be the only New Yorker _ or more precisely,
soon-to-be-New-Yorker _ who has not chosen sides in the
Mets-Yankees faceoff.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's nonrevealing response was in keeping with the
generally risk-averse nature of these early days of her presumed
campaign for the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, for example, she came to a biological field
station of Fordham University to denounce Republicans in Congress
for failing to finance a $65 million network for tracking emerging
epidemics. The context was the outbreak of West Nile-like
encephalitis in New York, but she declined to suggest the network
would have made any difference in how the matter was handled, nor
did she find fault with Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real issue,'' she said, ``is will we be prepared next
time, because I think all of us agree there will be a next time.''
</P>
<P>
   From here, Mrs. Clinton headed back to New York City for another
fund-raiser, arranged by the Rap impresario Russell Simmons. The
first lady had no plans to drop in on any ball games that might be
taking place in the Bronx, said Wolfson (who is, he revealed
without hesitation, a Yankees fan.)

KINGS READY FOR WEST RIVALS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ After three games against Eastern Conference teams
and four days off, the Kings fly to Calgary this afternoon for the
first of two games against Western Conference opponents.
</P>
<P>
   The Flames and Oilers have one victory between them, but as
teams from the West, the Kings will play them a little differently
than they did the Washington Capitals last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings blew a two-goal lead to tie the Caps 2-2. Under a new
system, teams each receive a point for a tie game after regulation
and another point if they win in the five-minute, sudden-death
overtime period.
</P>
<P>
   Against nonconference opponents on the road, the Kings said they
didn't mind playing for the tie. But against teams that could
impact the Kings season-long battle to make the playoffs, the team
is expected to be more aggressive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly didn't want to tie a game that we were leading
2-0,'' coach Andy Murray said. ``But to go home after starting the
season 3-1-1 on the road is pretty good in my book.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the new rules, teams use four skaters in the extra session
to promote more scoring. So far the Kings are tied for second in
the conference with 14 goals, including seven by league leader Luc
Robitaille, who was named NHL Player of the Week.
</P>
<P>
   Robitaille actually was in the penalty box for more than 1{
minutes to begin the overtime against Washington, putting the Caps
at a 4-3 advantage. Robitaille returned to the ice and swatted away
a last-second shot in front of the goal to preserve the tie.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a little too exciting,'' Murray said. ``But I like the
new setup. It will be wide open and we need that. You can gain a
point in your conference if you tie and another if you win. If you
lose, you still get a point.''
</P>
<P>
   The Flames will take anything they can get these days. The NHL's
second-youngest team behind the New York Islanders earned its first
point Monday afternoon with a tie against Carolina. The Hurricanes
play in the Eastern Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Playing time: Forward Dan Bylsma and defenseman Jaroslav Modry,
who were scratched from each of the Kings' first five games, were
sent to the Kings' minor-league affiliate, the Long Beach Ice Dogs,
to play Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Murray wanted to keep both sharp and the players will accompany
the team to Calgary and Edmonton this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Modry had an outstanding training camp, playing in place of
Mattias Norstrom, who missed the entire preseason in a contract
dispute. Murray told Modry two days before the season opener in
Nashville that Norstrom was close to signing and that Modry would
lose playing time.
</P>
<P>
   Modry played 64 games last season at Long Beach with six goals
and 29 assists. Bylsma played most of the 1998-99 season with the
Ice Dogs but appeared in eight games with the Kings.
</P>
<P>
   Storr ready: With back-to-back games in Calgary on Friday and
Edmonton on Saturday, the Kings wanted to make sure goalie Jamie
Storr was ready. He started the second of back-to-back games last
Thursday but left after one period with a strained right groin.
</P>
<P>
   Stephane Fiset, who has started four of the first five games,
entered the game Thursday against Tampa Bay and turned away all 17
shots he faced. Storr, who missed 16 games last season with astrained left groin, participated in workouts this week.

EDITORIAL: A DAMAGING ARMS CONTROL DEFEAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, Oct. 14:
</P>
<P>
   In a narrow and misguided show of partisanship, the
Republican-led Senate on Wednesday forced a vote on the nuclear
test ban treaty and defeated it by a margin of 48-51.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate's action _ its bluntest rebuff of a president on a
major international agreement since it voted down Woodrow Wilson's
Treaty of Versailles in 1919 _ is a destructive abdication of U.S.
leadership on arms control and other international issues. The harm
done to U.S. foreign policy and national security could be
considerable. President Clinton must now do what he can to limit
the damage.
</P>
<P>
   Tactical blunders were made on all sides of the treaty debacle.
Democratic senators insisted that the issue be included on the
Senate calendar though they were well short of the 67 votes needed
for ratification. The White House belatedly launched its campaign
for the treaty and seemed unprepared for opposition testimony. But
by far the greatest blame belongs to Senate Majority Leader Trent
Lott and the Republican caucus, which allowed itself to become
captive to some of the party's most parochial senators.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days Lott stubbornly rejected efforts by Senate
Democratic leaders to avoid the international embarrassment of a
rejection vote even when they were prepared to offer him firm
assurances that the treaty would not be reintroduced without his
approval during the life of the present Congress. Those guarantees
amounted to a painful concession by treaty supporters. But they
were right to make the offer. Regrettably, Lott turned them down.
</P>
<P>
   Understandably, Senate Democrats now intend to make an issue of
the Republicans' unstatesmanlike handling of the test ban treaty.
They are entitled to do so, and the American people may choose to
register their unhappiness over this Senate vote in next year's
elections. But the Democrats should remember that any future
attempt to ratify the treaty, which must presumably wait until
after those elections, will require bipartisan support, since the
Constitution requires a two-thirds Senate majority for approval.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, some of the worst fears expressed by treaty
opponents may now be more likely to come about as a result of
Wednesday's vote. These include nuclear weapons development by
countries that have not yet signed the treaty, erosion of America's
current lead in weapons technology and secret low-yield testing by
Russia or other nuclear powers.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest dangers lie in South Asia, especially after this
week's military coup in Pakistan. It will be much harder now for
the United States to persuade both India and Pakistan to sign a
test ban trea the Senate has refused to ratify. Washington
must also keep working to prevent such potential nuclear powers as
Iran, Iraq and North Korea from moving ahead toward their own
nuclear tests.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate vote will also complicate America's nuclear diplomacy
with China, which has signed the treaty and is observing a
voluntary moratorium on testing. Beijing has recently acquired
improved bomb designs, possibly through espionage at U.S. nuclear
labs. China may be tempted to test those designs if it begins to
seem as if the treaty will never be ratified.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a greater risk that a future Russian government
might feel tempted to conduct secret underground nuclear tests now
that plans for establishing the treaty's worldwide network of
monitoring stations and its provisions for on-site inspections have
been indefinitely postponed.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge for Clinton will be to do his best to discourage
such dangerous developments by keeping alive some realistic hope of
eventual U.S. ratification. After 40 years of bipartisan efo
make the world safer through arms control treaties, dating back to
the Eisenhower administration, it is dismaying that a small band of
Republican opponents could abruptly upend U.S. policy.  &QL;

146 PERCENT RISE IN EARNINGS AT BEAR STEARNS FALLS BELOW ESTIMATES
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By PATRICK McGEEHAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Bear Stearns Cos. posted first-quarter earnings
Wednesday that fell short of expectations, a trend-breaking
disappointment that the securities firm attributed to weaker
markets for the stocks and bonds it underwrites and trades.
</P>
<P>
   For the quarter ended Sept. 24, Bear Stearns, the sixth-largest
Wall Street securities firm, had net income of $157.on, or
$1 a diluted share, up 146 percent from $64.1 million, or 38 cents
a share, in the unusually bleak period a year earlier. Revenue rose
to $1.05 billion from $740.9 million.
</P>
<P>
   But the results fell well short of analysts' expectations, which
were for $1.15 a share, according to First Call/Thomson Financial,
which tracks company earnings. Bear Stearns was the only large
securities firm that did not report better-than-expected earnings
in the latest quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Investors reacted by pushing shares of Bear Stearns down $3.50,
or 8.7 percent, to $36.75.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been crushing the numbers for three quarters in a row,
but this time they came up short,'' said Chuck Hill, director of
research at First Call. ``No matter how you slice it, they missed
the number.''
</P>
<P>
   The trend among securities firms has been to post profits much
higher than those in the period a year earlier, when a global
economic crisis sent financial markets into a tailspin, but down
from a revved-up first half of 1999. Still, the magnitude of the
dropoff in some of Bear Stearns' businesses, especially its trading
operations, caught most analysts off-guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue is that, relative to other firms, their declines
business by business were greater,'' said Joan Solotar, an analyst
at Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette.
</P>
<P>
   As an example, analysts pointed to the firm's 20 percent drop in
investment banking revenue, to $262.5 million from $324.9 million,
despite a big increase in gains from the sale of merchant-banking
investments.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Solotar said Bear Stearns suffered by comparison in Europe,
where some of its competitors have raked in big fees for advising
companies on a spree of mergers and acquisitions. ``Even
domestically, you're continuing to see the tiering effect where the
top firms are separating from the rest,'' she said. ``That has to
hurt the tier-two company.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the investor unrest, Bear Stearns executives said they
were pleased by the results. ``This quarter, while it was not
spectacular, was very solid,'' said Samuel L. Molinaro, the chief
financial officer. He said revenue rose for the firm's clearing
business, which processes trades for smaller brokerage firms.
</P>
<P>
   That operation landed the firm in legal trouble when one of its
clearing clients, the now-defunct brokerage firm A.R. Baron &AMP; Co.,
was charged with defrauding investors in thinly traded stocks. Last
summer, Bear Stearns agreed to pay $38.5 million to settle charges
filed against it for its role in clearing Baron's fraudulent
trades.
</P>
<P>
   Molinaro said the cost of that settlement did not significantly
affect Bear Stearns' first-quarter earnings because the firm had
previously set aside money for that purpose. He said much of the 30
percent increase in ``other expenses'' for the period, to $96
million, went toward the firm's restricted-stock plan for
employees.
</P>
<P>
   That amount came on top of $516.4 million in employee
compensation and benefits, which ate up about 49 percent of the
firm's net revenue for the quarter. Bear Stearns traditionally
gives its executives some of the fattest pay packages on Wall
Street. Last week, it disclosed that it had paid $76 million to its
top five executive officers for the fiscal year 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The firm's proxy statement also disclosed another change: Bear
Stearns is reviving the practice of using stock options to pay key
employees. Those options would grant holders the right to buy the
stock for as little as half of its market price at the time the
options are granted.

JAMES LOGAN, WINNER OF THE MEDAL OF HONOR, DIES AT 78  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD GOLDSTEIN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   James M. Logan, who won the Medal of Honor as an army sergeant
in World War II by single-handedly capturing a German machine-gun
position in the first hours of the landing at Salerno, Italy, died
on Saturday at a hospital in Longview, Texas. He was 78.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, said the Rader Funeral Home in the nearby
town of Kilgore, where he lived.
</P>
<P>
   Before dawn on Sept. 9, 1943, American soldiers entered the
German-occupied European continent for the first time. The U.S.
36th Infantry Division, untested in battle, joined American and
British commandos and two British divisions in the Fifth Army's
Operation Avalanche. They went ashore around the Gulf of Salerno,
hoping to capture nearby German outposts, then seize the port at
Naples, 50 miles to the north, and join with the British Eighth
Army for a drive on Rome.
</P>
<P>
   Sgt. James Marion Logan, a Texan with the 141st Infantry
Regiment, 36th Division _ originally a Texas National Guard
division _ was in the first wave of the beach assault.
</P>
<P>
   The Italian government had surrendered to the Allies the day
before, but German tanks and machine-gunners occupying high ground
raked the invading Americans with heavy fire. Nonetheless, by 7
a.m., three and a half hours after the invasion began, the 36th
Division had moved 800 yards inland.
</P>
<P>
   Logan was advancing on flat terrain when the Germans
counterattacked from a four-foot-high rock wall 200 yards farther
inland. Exposing himself to fire from a machine gun along the wall
that sprayed the ground close by, showering him with flying dirt
and stones, he killed three Germans as they came through a gap in
the wall, then headed for the machine-gun position.
</P>
<P>
   As he dashed across the open ground, the Germans blazed away.
But he got to the wall, then crawled along its base until he
reached the machine gun. He jumped up, shot two Germans manning it,
hurdled the wall and seized the gun. He swung it around and fired
on fleeing German soldiers, then captured an officer and a private
trying to sneak away.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the morning, Logan went after a sniper hidden in a
house 150 yards from his company. He withstood heavy fire, shot the
lock off the door, kicked it in and shot the sniper.
</P>
<P>
   Logan received his Medal of Honor in a ceremony outside Naples
on June 6, 1944, D-Day. He was also awarded the Distinguished
Service Cross, the Army's highest medal for bravery next to the
Medal of Honor.
</P>
<P>
   Logan, a native of McNeil, Texas, was discharged from the Army
in May 1945 and spent three decades working for Exxon. He is
survived by a son, Paul, of Dallas, four grandchildren and a
great-granddaughter.
</P>
<P>
   On Memorial Day 1997, in a ceremony at the Texas Capitol in
Austin, he received the state's first Legislative Medal of Honor,
for bravery in combat.
</P>
<P>
   ``You remember the people who died close to you,'' he said then.

AMBUSH LEAVES 3 LAW OFFICERS DEAD IN TEXAS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JAMES PINKERTON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PLEASANTON, Texas _ A man who made a phony 911 call lay in wait
with an assault rifle and killed three law enforcement officers,
including a deputy who earlier had arrested him for beating his
wife.
</P>
<P>
   Before his fury played out three hours later Tuesday night,
21-year-old Jeremiah Engleton shot two more officers and held off
75 more officers. Then he spun around in a circle, spraying gunfire
in every direction in a last attempt to hit anyone within range
before he killed himself.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators could only speculate that Engleton's anger was
connected to his arrest less than 24 hours earlier for beating his
wife, who fled their mobile home before he was released from jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if he felt the police had caused his wife to
leave him or what,'' said Atascosa County Sheriff Tommy Williams.
``He had to blame somebody, and I would say he took it out on us.''
</P>
<P>
   The shooting outside this ranch town south of San Antonio was
the deadliest assault on law enforcement officers in Texas since
the Branch Davidians killed four federal agents outside Waco in
1993.
</P>
<P>
   The officers slain Tuesday were Atascosa County sheriff's
Deputies Thomas Monse Jr., 31, and Mark Stephenson, who would have
turned 32 Friday, and Texas Department of Public Safety Trooper
Terry Miller, 37.
</P>
<P>
   It was Monse who had arrested Engleton on assault charges around
1 a.m. Tuesday for beating his 35-year-old wife, Violet.
</P>
<P>
   The sheriff said Engleton had also been arrested in April for
hitting her, although not as violently.
</P>
<P>
   While Engleton was locked up, a sheriff's department's family
violence officer advised his wife to leave. By the time Engleton
posted his $2,000 bond Tuesday afternoon, she and their
15-month-old daughter were gone.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Deputy David Soward said that immediately after Engleton
got out of the county jail in Jourdanton, he headed to Pleasanton,
went to a gun store and bought $200 worth of ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   He called 911 shortly after 8 that evening, telling the
operator, ``need someone ... right way,'' giving his address and
hanging up.
</P>
<P>
   Monse was the first to arrive. He was shot immediately with
Engleton's SKS Chinese-made semiautomatic assault rifle, then
apparently was hit again as he got out of his car.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, Stephenson drove up. The same thing
happened to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``They both were probably shot in the car, got out of the car,''
the sheriff said, ``and he probably shot them again.''
</P>
<P>
   And it appeared that Engleton had taken each officer's Glock
automatic pistol and shot each man in the back of the head with his
own gun, Williams said. Investigators did not know if the deputies
were still alive or conscious when those last shots were fired.
</P>
<P>
   ``These officers, as far as I'm concerned, they done everything
right,'' the sheriff said. ``There's no way to prepare for
something like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty minutes later, Trooper Miller arrived after a dispatcher
reported no contact with the two deputies. Miller radioed in,
saying, ``Two officers down.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We surmise that in the next three or four seconds after he did
that, he took on fire and he tried to back out of there, back down
the road, but he was shot while he was trying to back out,'' Soward
said.
</P>
<P>
   Miller's car rolled into a ditch across the road. He died with
his seat belt still fastened.
</P>
<P>
   Living nearby was U.S. Marshal Carl Fisher, who either heard the
police radio or was curious about the gunfire. The shots were so
near that his wife hid in the closet.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher arrived on the scene, and so did Pleasanton police
Officer Louis Tudyk.
</P>
<P>
   The sheriff's office got a call from Fisher on his cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``911? This is Carl and Louis,'' he said. ``We're both here with
gunshots.'' On the tape of the call, gunfire is clearly heard in
the background.
</P>
<P>
   Next on the scene was Wendell Munson, owner of a local cattle
company who also lives nearby. Munson drove up in his truck and
hastily rescued Fisher and Tudyk, braving the gunfire. As he drove
away, Engleton sprayed his truck with shots, puncturing the tires.
</P>
<P>
   But Munson was able to get the two men to a waiting ambulance.
</P>
<P>
   As more officers swarmed the area, Soward said, ``we couldn't
move very much'' because of the darkness and because no one knew
exactly where the gunman was.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, a San Antonio police helicopter with infrared cameras
arrived. ``It was real tense until the helicopter got him
pinpointed, and then we knew where he was and we could take
cover,'' Soward said.
</P>
<P>
   Little is known about Engleton. Residents said he moved to the
area from San Antonio less than a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   He appeared to be unemployed, and authorities said he had no
criminal record.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, he used the pistol of one of the officers he had
killed to shoot himself in the head. He also was shot by
approaching officers who saw he was still moving. Nearby, police
found a shotgun and three pistols in addition to the deputies' guns
and assault rifle.
</P>
<P>
   As signs and billboards expressing grief sprouted up around
Pleasanton, Jim Daughtry, an oil and gas company executive, spoke
of the tragedy and the loss of innocence in another small town.
</P>
<P>
   ``Atascosa County, in the last 10 years, we've gotten a lot of
the rough stuff out of San Antonio. But we've never had nothing
like this,'' he said. ``We don't have murders here, especially law
officers.''
</P>
<P>
   In a strange postscript, the gunman's two grief-stricken
brothers from San Antonio were arrested just hours after he died.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Engleton, 25, was arrested around 2 a.m. Wednesday on a
charge of public intoxication and unlawful possession of a weapon
after a friend drove him to Pleasanton and he tried to get to his
dead brother's home.
</P>
<P>
   In San Antonio early Wednesday, Jonnell Engleton, 20, was
arrested after neighbors reported hearing gunshots. He was sitting
alone and distraught in a car. He was charged with unlawful
carrying of a weapon and resisting arrest.

GORE PICKS UP LABOR ENDORSEMENT, SLAMS RECORD OF BUSH 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CRAGG HINES 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Vice President Al Gore, claiming his long-sought
endorsement by the AFL-CIO, on Wednesday slammed the labor record
of Texas Gov. George W. Bush and stiffened a pledge to veto
anti-union legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Make no mistake, there is a battle,'' Gore told cheering
delegates at the labor confederation's convention. ``I stand with
you. I will fight with you.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore faulted Bush's support of a proposal to require specific
authorization from workers before their union dues can be used in
political campaigns and the governor's call to allow states to opt
out of future increases in the federal minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   Gore addressed AFL-CIO convention delegates shortly after they
shouted approval of a resolution endorsing his quest for the
Democratic presidential nomination and brushed aside Teamsters'
calls to delay a decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``The work of labor is to lead and not to follow,'' an exuberant
Gore declared. He entered the Los Angeles Convention Center to
pulsating salsa music, grasping outstretched hands and giving some
delegates high-fives.
</P>
<P>
   He spoke in a vast exhibition hall across the street from the
new arena where the Democratic National Convention next August will
select the party's nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has been focusing recently on the increasingly potent
nomination challenge from former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey.
But because of Bradley's strong labor record, Gore trained his
rhetorical guns on Bush, even mentioning the Republican
front-runner by name, which he usually avoids.
</P>
<P>
   ``The current Republican front-runner believes we should pass
what's called `paycheck deception' tobust up unions and silence
working families,'' Gore said of the dues-authorization proposal,
which advocates refer to as a ``payroll protection'' measure. Gore,
along with most leading Democrats, opposes the idea, which has made
its way to the ballot in several states only to be defeated.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said Bush ``also believes there should be a lower minimum
wage for millions of struggling workers,'' a reference to the
Republican proposal for a so-called training wage for young people
entering the work force.
</P>
<P>
   ``And now he says let's refuse to raise the minimum wage unless
individual states can opt out of the minimum-wage increase,'' Gore
said. ``I guess that's Governor Bush's idea of 'compassionate
conservatism.' States get to choose one or the other.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm for a minimum wage increase in every state including the
state of Texas, because people can't get by on what it is today,''
Gore said. ``It ought to be raised $1 an hour and be phased in over
the next couple of years.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokeswoman Mindy Tucker said ``it is compassionate to
protect the paychecks of union members'' so they are not forced to
contribute to political campaigns or parties through dues
checkoffs. Tucker also said ``it's compassionate to make sure we
protect jobs by allowing states where jobs would be eliminated by
raising the minimum wage to opt out.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's rhetorical assertiveness masked the fact that he
solicited the union endorsement as a lifeline for his sluggish
campaign. Labor's official move into Gore's camp comes as polling
indicates Bradley is gaining on Gore nationally. The former senator
already leads Gore in several large or early-voting states, such as
New Hampshire, traditionally the site of the first primary, and New
York, which with California is among a mass of states scheduled to
hold primaries March 7. The latest CNN-USA Today national survey by
the Gallup Organization showed Gore leading Bradley 51 percent to
39 percent, down from 63 percent to 30 percent in mid-September.
</P>
<P>
   Both polls showed Bradley and Gore trailing Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Brown, a vice president of the International
Longshoremen's Association, urged delegates to back Gore so that
Bush ``not be given aid and comfort by our failure to act.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley had urged the AFL-CIO, with 13 million members in its
dozens of unions, to withhold an endorsement until the campaign
takes firmer shape.
</P>
<P>
   Similar caution had been advocated by the Teamsters and United
Auto Workers, two major AFL-CIO component unions. Teamsters leaders
spoke against the endorsement and voiced scattered 'nays' in an
anti-climactic voice vote.
</P>
<P>
   FL-CIO President John J. Sweeney said the quickly
approaching primary season _ the first caucus will be in Iowa in
January _ dictated action.
</P>
<P>
   The union move cuts off one more avenue for Bradley to the heart
of the Democratic Party, but he issued a statement thanking Sweeney
and union members who supported him and added: ``My commitment to
working men and women and the role that labor can play in their
lives is unwavering.''
</P>
<P>
   The Gore campaign's high command declared the labor vote was
``the first primary,'' a phrase used by campaign chairman Tony
Coelho and campaign manager Donna Brazile. Union representatives
have made up about one quarter of the delegates to recent
Democratic National Conventions and claim about the same proportion
of specially appointed ``super delegates.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore fought for the endorsement because it is considered yet one
more testimonial that the candidate favored by the Democrat
establishment needs to have. It can also be an organizational plus
because of the unions' contact with its members.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Federal and state health officials told grocers
Wednesday to remove from their shelves Sabrett hot dogs that carry
an Oct. 22 sell-by date, because two packages from a Saratoga
Springs, N.Y., market were contaminated with listeria bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   Listeria usually causes mild flu-like symptoms in healthy
people, but can be serious or even fatal in children, the elderly,
pregnant women and people with depressed immune systems, said Pete
Gregg, a spokesman for the State Department of Agriculture and
Markets.
</P>
<P>
   The warning refers only to 1-pound packages of Sabrett's
Skinless Beef Frankfurters, Gregg said. The hot dogs were
distributed to stores in New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, North
Carolina, George and Florida, he said.

WILLIAMS RETURNS, WITHOUT A RACKET
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By ROBIN FINN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A buoyant Serena Williams ventured back to New York
Wednesday for the first time since she captured her first Grand
Slam title, and became the first black woman since Althea Gibson to
win a major title, at the U.S. Open last month.
</P>
<P>
   In a generous mood, Williams praised Gibson, as well as her
older sister Venus for paving her way toward tennis posterity.
</P>
<P>
   ``People like Althea gave me this opportunity,'' said Williams,
who has interviewed the reclusive Gibson, by fax, for the monthly
newsletter she and her sister publish from their home in Palm Beach
Gardens, Fla. ``I hope I can inspire other young kids to get into
tennis.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams said she felt blessed to have her sister for a
trailblazer, but insisted that she felt no additional pressure to
become an African-American role model after her Grand Slam victory.
She also expressed no regrets about dedicating her childhood to
training.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have the opportunity of a lifetime,'' she said. ``People
would give their left arm to have this opportunity. And I'm going
to take my opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   That's exactly what Williams did at the Open, said Brandi
Williams, her mother, coach and chaperone. Unlike Venus, who lost
in the 1997 Open final, Serena maintained a carpe diem attitude
through all seven rounds this year. Within the family, Brandi
Williams said, there are no hard feelings that Serena, the younger
sister, collected a Grand Slam title before Venus. ``If anything,
Serena is setting a good example for Venus now,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The last time Serena Williams came to New York, she was a player
in search of her first major championship. This time she came as a
full-fledged celebrity, right down to the lap dog she cuddled like
a furry life preserver.
</P>
<P>
   One of the perks of making your first million before turning 18,
said Williams _ whose two latest singles titles were worth $1.5
million _ is being able to support your own dog. But she no longer
plans to become a veterinarian after her retirement from tennis;
she has enrolled at a Florida art institute to pursue a degree in
fashion design between tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, clad in black leather and traveling in a black
limousine, passed a tennis-free day in Manhattan Wednesday that
included a motivational visit to Public School 129 in Harlem,
appearances on talk shows with Barbara Walters and Conan O'Brien
and a shopping spree at Saks Fifth Avenue, where she rated the VIP
fitting room.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said her next goal in tennis, the No. 1 ranking, could
wait until next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I can be the best player out there if I work hard, but
I'm definitely ready for a wind-down,'' said Williams, who just
turned 18. Her next and last 1999 event is the invitational Chase
Championships at Madison Square Garden, beginning Nov. 15.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Williams followed her breakthrough at the Open
with one on a more personal front _ she defeated Venus for the
first time, dethroning her sister as champion of the Grand Slam Cup
in Munich, Germany. The victory ended a three-match losing streak,
and although Serena did not pretend to be sorry it happened, she
did memorize her sister's reaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``She came over to my side of the net and she said, `Sometimes
little sisters can be very mean,''' said Williams, whose older
sister is competing alone in Zurich this week.

ANGER ON AGENDA FOR WTO SUMMIT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By ELIZABETH OLSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA, Switzerland _ A dispute over the agenda that appears to
pit developing nations against the United States has injected a
tense atmosphere into preparations for the World Trade
Organization's summit next month.
</P>
<P>
   Non-industrialized countries in the 134-member group that makes
the rules for global commerce had drafted a detailed list of
priorities for the Seattle meeting agenda, determined to rectify
what they see as bias in current trade rules that have benefited
larger economic powers at their expense.
</P>
<P>
   But their two-page list was mysteriously deleted from the first
formal draft of the agenda that circulated at the organization's
Geneva headquarters earlier this week. Representatives of
developing nations expressed outrage, particularly because the
coming summit has been publicly extolled by the group's new
director general, Mike Moore, as a forum meant for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was totally, totally unfair. It shocks us, frankly,'' said
India's trade envoy to Geneva, Srinivasan Narayanan.
</P>
<P>
   While no names were publicly mentioned, the United States was
blamed and accused of bullying tactics. ``It was too convenient.
Every single item developing countries wanted was eliminated,''
said one aggrieved trade envoy.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. representatives to the trade group declined to comment on
these accusations Wednesday, saying only that the agenda remains
subject to negotiation.
</P>
<P>
   But a subsequent version of the agenda draft restored much of
what developing nations had proposed earlier. Whether all or even
some of those issues survive the final draft remains unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Among them are a proposal to weaken anti-dumping measures, an
important U.S. trade tool used to protect U.S. manufacturers from
low-priced imports. Developing countries want a one-year waiting
period between inquiries into a product that has flooded the
market. The United States would likely reject such a change.
</P>
<P>
   Another agenda item sought by developing countries would
reintroduce subsidies to protect domestic manufacturers, made
illegal in previous trade agreements. Countries such as India argue
that subsidies are necessary to protect their native businesses
from foreign competition.
</P>
<P>
   Modifying rules for the textile trade is also on the developing
countries' list. They want to shorten the 10-year schedule for
lifting restrictions on imports. The Americans want to keep the
schedule unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   Developing nations also want the agenda to include proposed
changes that would delay enforcement of intellectual property
rights, postpone a tightening of trade-related investment rules and
force pharmaceutical companies to sell essential drugs at
affordable prices.
</P>
<P>
   In recent congressional testimony, the U.S. Trade
Representative, Charlene Barshefsky, gave little support for such a
wish list, saying implementation of existing agreements is
necessary to the credibility of future negotiations.''
</P>
<P>
   But comments by a top Commerce Department official this week
indicate that the United States may offer some room to compromise,
partly because it wants the trade summit to include negotiations on
raising labor standards among all member nations. This is an
important issue to American and European unions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we could get a trade deal though Congress
without some kind of concessions,'' said Deputy Commerce Secretary
Robert Mallett. He indicated that U.S. negotiators may have to put
``some incentives on the table ... perhaps a more protracted
timetable for the implementation of some issues.''

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JONATHAN FEIGEN  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
SEATTLE _ Rudy Tomjanovich had one hero, one favorite player who
stood as far above all other choices as he did opponents.
Tomjanovich tied paper around his knees to mimic Wilt Chamberlain's
kneepads. He finger-rolled trash into the garbage.
<TEXT>
<P>
   And when Tomjanovich reached the NBA, he played as if to show
his hero that he belonged on the same court.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like a dream playing against the guy,'' Tomjanovich
said.
</P>
<P>
   But there was one part of the fantasy Tomjanovich had never
concocted back in Hamtramck, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hated me,'' Tomjanovich recalled Wednesday, a day after
Chamberlain died in Bel-Air, Calif. ``I was this young guy going
after rebounds, sometimes on shots that would go in. I'd end up on
his back, and he got pretty irritated. He tried to intimidate me
when I'd come into games.''
</P>
<P>
   Chamberlain never got over his feelings about Tomjanovich. But
Tomjanovich had an accomplice in getting under Chamberlain's skin.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were playing down at the Dome,'' said Calvin Murphy,
Tomjanovich's teammate then and eventually a friend of Chamberlain.
``Rudy dunked on Wilt, and I'm talking a hellacious tomahawk. I
started talking . I said, `Damn, Wilt, he just busted you.' Wilt
came into our huddle and said, `From now on, nobody gets nothing.'
</P>
<P>
   ``From that point on, Wilt wanted to fight Rudy. Out in LA, Rudy
was on the foul line. I was on the bench, and Wilt was talking .
And I'm talking back. I'm on the bench anyway, (saying) `Rudy, I've
got your back.'''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, when traveling with Chamberlain, Murphy said he
asked Chamberlain why he maintained his obvious distaste for
Tomjanovich during the three seasons both were in the league.
Chamberlain told Murphy then that he never got over the dunk.
</P>
<P>
   But at least Tomjanovich's hero never forgot him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would always attack the boards and wind up on his back,''
Tomjanovich said. ``It used to aggravate the hell out of him. He
was being dubbed the strongest basketball player in the league. He
had really bulked up by then.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Why the hell do I have to have him be my hero, No. 1,
and the strongest guy in the league mad at me, No. 2?' He used to
tell me, `Get your butt out of here.' But I told him, `Look, I've
got to do my job.' But he came after me a couple of times.
</P>
<P>
   ``You start realizing sometimes your expectations aren't what
you wanted. Calvin used to always rip me about that. When we were
going to play the Lakers, he'd tell me I was going to aggravate the
guy. He'd be under the basket, and I'd come in looking for
offensive rebounds.''
</P>
<P>
   When Tomjanovich finally got his chance to see his hero up
close, Chamberlain did not disappoint.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before I got in the league, he used a fadeaway bank shot in
the left corner that was unstoppable,'' Tomjanovich said. ``He was
the most dominating force there was. He was still a really, really
good force if he played today. The 100 points probably would never
have happened. They didn't do all the double-down stuff, the
rotations then. But he was very athletic before he bulked himself
up. He could pass, rebound, block shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a guy that really could do just about anything. When he
set up his mind to score, he was going to score; to rebound, he
would rebound. His stats will never be broken.''

EDITORIAL: NEW RISK FOR CAMPAIGN LAW 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, Oct. 14:
</P>
<P>
   An important but little-noticed boost was given to campaign
finance reform in the Senate this week. Sam Brownback of Kansas
became the eighth Republican to break with his party's leadership
and support the McCain-Feingold soft-money ban, scheduled for
debate Thursday. There are now 53 votes to choke off a
Republican-led filibuster and pass the bill, only seven votes short
of what is needed. The pressure is mounting on other Republicans to
support reform. But amid these favorable developments, a move by
Robert Torricelli and some other Democratic supporters of reform
could undercut the cause.
</P>
<P>
   The risk is posed by a Democratic attempt to block Sens. John
McCain and Russell Feingold from advancing a stripped-down 
of their reform legislation. The new McCain-Feingold bill would
omit a section preventing independent groups from raising unlimited
money for sham campaign ads two months before an election. Some
Republicans say that because that section threatens free speech,
they cannot go along with the central objective of reform, which is
to ban unlimited donations to campaigns waged by political parties.
Shrinking the bill to a simple soft-money ban for parties has paid
off. Brownback is on board and other Senate Republicans may follow.
</P>
<P>
   Torricelli and the Democratic Senate leader, Tom Daschle, are
nonetheless determined to scrap the new McCain-Feingold bill and
substitute the original bill, with the limits on independent
groups. This is a serious tactical mistake that raises questions
about the Democrats' commitment to campaign finance reform. They
ought to know that the bill they are pushing does not have the
votes to break a filibuster, whereas the revised McCain-Feingold
bill has a chance of getting them.
</P>
<P>
   It would be especially grievous if their move played into the
destructive tactics of Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and other
Republican foes of reform. McConnell might even try to deliver
enough votes for the Democratic move, allowing it to pass because
in the end the bill in that form will surely die.
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats, noting that the House passed its broader
Shays-Meehan reform bill last month, warn that a narrower bill in
the Senate will not survive either. But Brownback's courageous move
makes it worth a try.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate development, Rep. Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas, an
influential Republican in the House, also announced his backing of
the stripped-down version. His brother, Sen. Tim Hutchinson of
Arkansas, could follow suit. Sens. Pete Fitzgerald of Pennsylvania,
William Roth of Delaware, Chuck Hagel of Nebraska and George
Voinovich and Mike DeWine of Ohio are known to be looking at this
new version of reform. They need to liberate themselves from
McConnell and from the ring of their party's cash machines. If they
do, a campaign cleanup can actually happen.

EDITORIAL: THE TRUTH ABOUT TOBACCO
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, Oct. 14:
</P>
<P>
   After denying the truth for decades, Philip Morris now admits
that cigarettes cause cancer and other fatal diseases and are
addictive. In what appears to be a calculated turnabout, the
tobacco company says on its new Internet Web site that ``there is
overwhelming medical and scientific consensus that cigarette
smoking causes cancer, heart disease, emphysema and other serious
diseases.'' It also now admits that ``cigarette smoking is
addictive, as that term is most commonly used today.''
</P>
<P>
   These admissions might have helped save American lives had they
been made 30 years ago when the tobacco industry's own researchers
found cigarettes to be addictive dispensers of nicotine. But as
late as 1994, top executives of the seven largest American tobacco
companies, including Philip Morris' president, testified in
Congress that they did not believe tobacco was addictive.
</P>
<P>
   Denial no longer works with the public or with government
officials who have been forced to deal with smoking-related health
costs. The $246 billion settlements in state lawsuits for Medicaid
expenses against the industry, and greater willingness by juries to
award large damages to addicted smokers, are forcing the industry
to modify its tactics.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Morris' new stance is an effort, according to a company
spokesman, to begin a new public dialogue about tobacco. It may
also be a savvy way to limit liability in future lawsuits by
allowing the company to assert that it has given smokers full
warning. For the more than 35 million smokers who are addicted, the
company's new position will not make ending their addiction easier.
</P>
<P>
   But truth-telling should have consequences. In admitting that
its business is sustained by addiction, Philip Morris should now
voluntarily agree to regulation of its product by the Food and Drug
Administration. In 1996 the FDA asserted power to regulate nicotine
and tobacco as a drug and a device ``intended to affect the
structure or any function of the body.'' The tobacco industry
promptly challenged that authority, arguing that the FDA lacked
jurisdiction to impose new restrictions on the sale of cigarettes
to teenagers and new limits on tobacco marketing.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court will take up the question of the FDAs
authority this term. The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled
last year that the FDA had no right to regulate tobacco. If upheld,
that odd decision would make tobacco the only addictive drug that
is not subject to government regulation.
</P>
<P>
   More than 400,000 Americans die annually from smoking-related
diseases, and the average smoker cuts his life short by 15 years.
Tobacco kills more people than alcohol, homicides, suicides, car
accidents, illegal drugs, AIDS and fires combined. For years,
industry leaders told the public that they would not knowingly sell
a dangerous product. Philip Morris, for one, is no longer hiding
behind that cover.

NEARLY 80 PERCENT HAVE PASSED STATEWIDE TEST 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ In the first high school class that is required
to pass the Regents English exam to graduate, nearly four in five
students have so far succeeded, state education officials announced
Wednesday. They hailed the results as evidence that raising
standards has raised performance. But the data were open to other
interpretations as well, experts said.
</P>
<P>
   In New York City, 55 percent of the class has passed thus far.
</P>
<P>
   Those numbers, for students who entered high school three years
ago and took the test in January or June, are expected to rise as
students who failed the test or have not yet taken it are able to
try next year.
</P>
<P>
   But there are ominous ambiguities buried in the numbers released
Wednesday. During a four-year transition period, the Board of
Regents has lowered the minimum passing grade for the exams from 65
percent, to 55. For those who begin ninth grade next year, the
class of 2004, the standard will rise to 65 again.
</P>
<P>
   What concerns some educators is that of the students who entered
high school three years ago, only 66 percent statewide have scored
65 or better, and just 40 percent of those in New York City have
done so.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, only an elite group of students have taken the
Regents exams, while most students have taken less stringent
competency exams to graduate. But beginnh those who entered
ninth grade in September 1996, all students must pass the Regents
exam in English to graduate.
</P>
<P>
   The city's schools chancellor, Rudy Crew, said he was encouraged
by the results. ``I am pleased to report that our students showed
steady improvement this year, which confirms my belief that with
the proper support from the system, all students can achieve at
higher levels,'' he said.

JUSTICES FAULT PACE OF EFFORT FOR PRESCHOOL IN NEW JERSEY
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By MARIA NEWMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ State Supreme Court justices criticized state
Education Department officials Wednesday over their slow pace in
putting into effect a court order to provide preschool for 3- and
4-year-olds in the state's 30 poorest districts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court believed the preschool program would be the
foundation for reform of the entire school system for these
districts,'' said Justice Gary S. Stein, noting that fewer than
half of the 49,000 eligible children in those districts had access
to preschool so far. ``The result has been chaotic. My question is,
how did this happen?''
</P>
<P>
   Seventeen months after the court ordered broad changes in
financing and programming to help the districts overcome the
disadvantages of poverty, the case was back in court Wednesday,
with the plaintiff, the Education Law Center of Newark, contending
that the preschool program provided by the state so far fell far
short of what the court intended.
</P>
<P>
   David Sciarra, the Law Center lawyer who is representing the
students in the districts, has said the Education Department and
Gov. Christie Whitman are engaging in ``consumer fraud'' and ``bait
and switch'' by providing a preschool program that does not have
properly trained teachers.
</P>
<P>
   He said Wednesday that to keep its costs down, the state had not
made the program available to all children who would be eligible.
He also said the state has tried to impose programs on districts _
and financing levels _ without taking into account their own
opinion on how best to serve their children.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has to be that the districts at the ground level get to
make these decisions, at least initially,'' Sciarra told the court
Friday . The Law Center is asking the court to appoint a judge to
oversee the making of the changes outlined in the court's decision
on Abbott vs. Burke, the nation's longest-running court battle to
improve the quality of education for urban schoolchildren.
</P>
<P>
   The state justices, who will not announce a decision on the
matter for some time, appeared to agree with the Law Center, at
least on some points.
</P>
<P>
   Stein pointed out that in September 1998, the state gave the
districts _ from large systems like Newark's to small ones like
Phillipsburg's _ one month to come up with their own plans for a
preschool program, and that it had received many creative plans.
</P>
<P>
   But in February, the Education Department sent letters to all of
the districts rejecting those plans, saying in large part that the
districts had not explored the possibility of working with existing
day care centers to provide such programs, something the court
order allows.
</P>
<P>
   The rejection letters arrived less than a month before the
districts had to make their budget requests to the state on how
much money they would need for their programs, Stein said, not long
enough for them to come up with another plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the classic Catch-22,'' Stein said. ``The effect of
that process has been so disillusioning to many of the
superintendents.''
</P>
<P>
   The state attorney general, John J. Farmer Jr., who represented
the Education Department in the hearings, acknowledged that there
had been several problems in the first year. But he attributed most
of it to the difficulties of trying to start such a huge program in
such a short time _ from May 1998 to September 1999 _ a task that
has involved coming up with new standards for the preschool
programs, training new teachers, recruiting students who were not
yet in the school system and finding space for the additional
students in districts that were often already overcrowded.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state has acted in good faith to implement preschool in
the Abbott districts,'' he said.

BILL REQUIRING TRIGGER LOCKS ON ALL HANDGUNS IS PASSED BY CITY
COUNCIL 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The City Council voted Wednesday to approve
legislation requiring all gun owners to use safety devices designed
to prevent accidental shootings by locking a weapon's trigger.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, which passed unanimously at a meeting of the full
Council Wednesday, was sponsored by Councilman Sheldon Leffler of
Queens and is supported by Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   The new law would broaden existing legislation that requires
that safety devices be installed on all pistols that are sold or
otherwise change hands in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new legislation, the devices would be required for all
weapons, and gun owners would be required to lock the triggers of
all firearms whenever they are not in use. The locks can cost as
little as $2 to $3, and are available from licensed gun dealers,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   A commission appointed by Giuliani to change the City Charter
has put forth a proposal that is virtually identical to the Council
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Leffler said the law would make the Charter change unnecessary.
``We have the legislative authority to do just what the Charter
proposal wants,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to the mayor said he had urged Leffler to introduce the
legislation and would most likely sign it.
</P>
<P>
   Leffler, the chairman of the Council's Public Safety Committee,
said the new law would provide ``additional protection from
accidental discharges.'' He said the law was aimed primarily at
protecting children but might save adults lives, too. ``Others, as
well, can sometimes set off a gun accidentally,'' he said.

THE SPIRIT OF THE ANCIENTS AND A CLASSICAL PURITY IN THE AUSTRALIAN
BALLET  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ANNA KISSELGOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Australian Ballet may usually be down under, but
it was absolutely tops on Tuesday night when it opened a weeklong
season at City Center with a brash and contemporary triple bill
brimming with energy and fresh ideas.
</P>
<P>
   With sexy men and good-humored women, all ablaze in the
perfection of classical style introduced by their current artistic
director, Ross Stretton, it was a very different Australian Ballet
from the past.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. premiere of ``Rites,'' a company collaboration with
Bangarra Dance Theater, a modern-dance troupe that focuses on the
heritage of Australia's Aborigines, added to the distinctly
Australian flavor of this first of three different programs.
</P>
<P>
   Discarding the scenario of Stravinsky's all-too-familiar ballet
score for ``The Rite of Spring,'' Stephen Page's choreography
nonetheless has something of the pantheistic inspiration of the
original. It also offers a singular Australian perspective:
``Rites'' is a story of Creation, referring directly to spirits
that in Aboriginal beliefs have inhabited the landscape of
Australia since the beginning of time.
</P>
<P>
   Centered on the charismatic Djakapurra Munyarryun, who dances in
the work with the Australian Ballet and fellow members of Bangarra,
``Rites'' is a fascinating and successful experiment. But it does
not mean that the Australian Ballet must seek Australian subject
matter to define itself.
</P>
<P>
   It there is to be an Australian style in ballet, it is most
likbe found in works by Stanton Welch, including his
``Divergence,'' which received a rousing reception after it opened
the program in a packed house filled with, among others, many
members of American Ballet Theater. Stretton, an Australian who
returned to Melbourne to succeed Maina Gielgud as artistic director
in 1997, was a Ballet Theater star for many years.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gielgud fostered the development of Welch and Stephen Baynes
as young choreographers in the company. ``Divergence'' was seen in
1994 when the Australian Ballet appeared at the John F. Kennedy
Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, and it was clear then
that the company was reaching a new level of technique.
</P>
<P>
   Stretton has now given it a greater classical purity, especially
impressive in the perfect body placement that recalls his own noble
style as a dancer. Yet this is not an old-fashioned style, and it
is used with a contemporary attack that literally stretches the
dancers' silhouettes withou losing form.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Divergence'' and in William Forsythe's ``In the Middle,
Somewhat Elevated,'' the two neo-classical pieces on the program,
the company has a sleekness, clarity and modern spirit that is a
far cry from how it looked on its first U.S. tour in 1970-71 with
Rudolf Nureyev, and even on its last visit to New York in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   It is true that Stretton has not included any 19th-century
classics, and one has to pay tribute to the company's early stars,
who excelled in those works: among them, Marilyn Jones and Garth
Welch, the parents of Stanton and Damien Welch, a principal in
``Divergence'' whose bravura comes with heartthrob appeal.
</P>
<P>
   If the original style in the company owed much to the British
view of classical ballet, Stretton and his new artistic staff
(Danilo Radojevic and Wendy Walker from Ballet Theater and Noelle
Shader, formerly of New York City Ballet) have streamlined the
dancers' classical silhouette and cleaned up the details in
technique.
</P>
<P>
   That is why Forsythe's way with classical technique (daring
images of acceleration and off-balance arabesques with something
always askew) looks perfectly at home in the Australian company.
``In the Middle, Somewhat Elevated,'' was seen here originally with
Sylvie Guillem, Isabel Guerin and other stars of the Paris Opera
Ballet, for which it was created.
</P>
<P>
   The larger-than-life dimension of the French cast is missing
here but the Australians, just plain excellent dancers, go at
Forsythe's sashaying and convoluted encounters in a bare-bones
setting with apt vim and vigor.
</P>
<P>
   Welch has a similar interest in subverting neo-classical
choreography, and his approach is more playful and sardonic. Now
bereft of the set it had in 1994, the piece is clearer on its
various levels, commenting on life in ballet and life in general.
</P>
<P>
   The women in pleated flat tutus throw these tutus into the wings
in the end, liberated to pursue most of the activities they have
been pursuing anyway until then to incidental music from Bizet's
``Arlesienne.''
</P>
<P>
   There are some images of women entering crablike in deep plies
and going through some programmed sex. There is plenty of kissing
amid the conventional ballet steps used unconventionally.
</P>
<P>
   Best of all is the astounding duet in which Damien Welch keeps
wrapping the s Justine Summers around his neck.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Rites'' Munyarryun dominates the stage, his large frame not
at odds with the spring in his t as he presides over the
joining of earth, water, fire and wind.
</P>
<P>
   Page's choreography is not always at one with Stravinsky's
music. But more important, he succeeds in suggesting the essence of
these elements through the ensemble. &QL;

GRAPPLING WITH DEATH OF A LEGEND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By E.J. MONTINI  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
(UNDATED) - One of the all-time greats, a sports legend in his 60s,
died quietly in his home recently. He deserved in death all the
testimonials he'd earned in life, but I had no plans to produce
one.
<TEXT>
<P>
   At least, not until Wilt Chamberlain, also in his 60s, died
quietly in his home, and every keyboard puncher in the West ern
Hemisphere filed a teary-eyed tribute.
</P>
<P>
   In our house, Wilt the Stilt wasn't nearly as big as Gorilla
Monsoon.
</P>
<P>
   Just over a week ago, the Associated Press reported that Robert
``Gorilla Mon soon'' Marella, died at age 62. The news came. The
news went. A paragraph bur ied in the sports section, maybe.
</P>
<P>
   Chamberlain made front pages every where.
</P>
<P>
   Almost always, when reporters mourn the passing of a great
athlete, they're only rewriting a eulogy to their own youth.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1960s, when I was a boy, we didn't know a Celtic
from a Laker from a Warrior. Basketball was hardly ever on
television. I don't remember see ing a game.
</P>
<P>
   But every week, my friends, my neigh bors, my parents, my
grandparents gath ered around to watch a show called Studio
Wrestling.
</P>
<P>
   It was produced at a television station in downtown Pittsburgh
and featured a ring, an announcer, a few rows of folding chairs
(always with a heavyset woman called Ringside Rosie sitting closest
to the ropes), a camera and, on its best days, the great Bruno
Sammartino.
</P>
<P>
   Bruno immigrated to western Pennsyl vania from the Abruzzi
region of Italy, where my mother's people lived. At the time, he
was the World Wrestling Federa tion champion. &QL; 
A MODEL `VILLAIN'
</P>
<P>
   Because he was a good Pittsburgh boy, he appeared often on
Studio Wrestling. And because the show's producers wanted to
capitalize on Bruno's hometown appeal while keeping the show fresh,
they'd bring in a series of ``evil'' opponents for him to defeat.
</P>
<P>
   There was 600-pound Haystacks Cal houn. And George ``The
Animal'' Steele. And Killer Kowalski. And Dick the Bruiser. And The
Crusher.
</P>
<P>
   And Gorilla Monsoon, who, in an exhi bition, once body-slammed
Muhammad Ali.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the ring, Robert ``Gorilla Monsoon'' Marella had a wife
and four children and, like Sammartino, was a friendly fellow who
spent most of his time with his family.
</P>
<P>
   You couldn't tell that from Studio Wrestling, though, which
played out like an old-fashioned Western staged in tight trunks.
</P>
<P>
   During the wrestling re-enactments performed in the bedroom I
shared with my older brother, I always played the bad guy.
</P>
<P>
   Gorilla Montini.
</P>
<P>
   This was not by choice. My brother's name is Sam, and, through
size and brute force, he claimed the champion's identity of Bruno
Sam Montini, eventually caus ing his smaller, weaker, but
surprisingly nefarious opponent to cry for his mommy. &QL; 
HERO OUT OF RING
</P>
<P>
   The real Gorilla Monsoon never did such a thing.
</P>
<P>
   This was before pay-per-view, steroids and face paint.
</P>
<P>
   Before heroes went out of fashion.
</P>
<P>
   After retiring from the ring, Gorilla Monsoon became a
commentator for wrestling matches, where he worked with the future
governor of Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Jesse Ventura issued a statement last week saying, ``The loss of
Gorilla Mon soon saddens me deeply. He was both a friend and a
colleague.''
</P>
<P>
   One of Marella's sons, Joey, died in an auto accident in 1994,
and the Gorilla character seldom appeared on television after that.
He is survived by his wife, Maureen, another son and two daughters.
</P>
<P>
   Wilt Chamberlain's sport is considered to be more legitimate
than Robert Marel la's, his accomplishments more profound.
Chamberlain claimed in his autobiogra phy to have slept with 20,000
women.
</P>
<P>
   These days, off-the-court accomplish ments like that will earn
you more more front-page eulogies than anything in the life of
Gorilla Monsoon, a loving father who, neighbors said, prided
himself on his lasagna. &QL;
