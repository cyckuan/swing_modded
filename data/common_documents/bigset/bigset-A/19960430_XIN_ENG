ATHENS, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Greek Prime Minister Costas
Simitis today held talks with his visiting Luxembourg counterpart
Jean-claude Juncker on issues concerning the European Union, its
institutions and the course towards economic and monetary union,
as well as Greek-Turkish relations.
</P>
<P>
The two premiers told reporters after the meeting that they
were in agreement as regard to the direction of the EU issues,
with Juncker stressing that there should be a mechanism of
protection of relations between the member countries taking part
in the single currency and those outside the single currency.
</P>

Simitis briefed Juncker on Greek-Turkish relations following
the meeting between the two countries' foreign ministers Theodoros
Pangalos and Emre Gonensay on Saturday on the sidelines of the
Black Sea economic cooperation meeting in Bucharest.
</P>
<P>
He said the Luxembourg premier believed that if claims existed,
recourse should be taken to the international court of justice at
the Hague.
</P>
<P>
Juncker said there should be a "public statement" on the
peaceful settlement of differences, on implementation of the rules
of international law, and on the non-threat of violence.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Expects US to Admonish Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The Cyprus government expects the
U.S. to admonish Turkey in order to persuade it into shifting its
intransigent position on the Cyprus problem, government spokesman
Yiannakis Cassoulides said here today.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman made the remarks while commenting on a position
reportedly held by U.S. President Bill Clinton that the U.S. does
not intend to exert pressure on Turkey.
</P>
<P>
"We do not expect to see pressure exerted on Turkey. We
expect the U.S. to admonish Turkey," the spokesman told the
press at his daily briefing.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated Cyprus' President Glafcos clerides' view that
"serious preparatory work should take place before Clerides and
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash meet."
</P>
<P>
Cassoulides said that the government insists on the need to
establish, behind the scenes or through proximity talks, whether
there is common ground on the fundamental aspects of the Cyprus
problem, such as security and guarantee of a future federal
Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
"Our political will to break the deadlock is granted and this
should be considered as a fact," he said. "If the Turkish side
responds in a similar manner, the next step would be direct
dialogue, under the auspices of the U.N. Secretary-General, aided
by the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council and
the European Union."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops
invaded and seized the northern third of the island following
an Athens-backed coup.
</P>
<P>
The problem has remained unsolved despite all peace efforts
for the past 22 years. The U.N. and the international community
are still trying hard to bring together the two communities'
leaders to a direct negotiation table in a bid to seek a peaceful
settlement.

<HEADLINE> New Home Sales in U.S. Hit 10-Month Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Sales of new homes in U.S.
dropped 7.6 percent in March to the lowest level in 10 months, the
U.S. Commerce Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department said sales of single-family new homes
totaled 672,000 at a seasonally adjusted annual rate, down from a
revised 727,000 in February. The February rate was revised from
originally estimated 700,000.
</P>
<P>
The decline was the second straight drop and pushed the sales
level to the lowest since a 667,000 rate last May. The drop was
the steepest since sales plunged 9.6 percent in August 1995.
</P>
<P>
The decline was due to the rising of mortgage rate recently.
After dipping to an average of 7.03 percent in January, rates
increased to 7.08 percent in February and 7.62 percent in March.
</P>
<P>
Reflecting the strong sales pace during January and February,
sales of new homes during the first three months of the year were
18.2 percent above those of the same period of 1995.
</P>
<P>
The seasonally adjusted estimate of new houses for sale at the
end of March was 379,000, representing a supply of 6.8 months at
the current sales rate. It was the largest inventory since 380,000
homes were on the block in February 1980.
</P>
<P>
Regionally, sales in the Northeast plunged 21.2 percent, the
largest decline since sales fell 29.2 percent in January. Sales
dropped 10 percent in the South and they decreased 4.1 percent in
the West. The Midwest registered the only gain, a small 0.9
percent increase.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Olympic Torch Relay Starts in L.A. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 27 (Xinhua) -- An across the United States
Olympic torch relay started from Los Angeles Saturday after the
flame arrived from Greece, where the Olympics was rooted more than
2,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
"It's a beacon that summons up the best in all of us,"
President Bill Clinton said in a message read to the 1,500 crowd
at a ceremony at the Los Angeles Coliseum by Vice President Al
Gore's wife Tipper.
</P>
<P>
Atlanta Olympics Organizing Committee President William Payne
also said that "it can be the dawn even of a new world."
</P>
<P>
At the end of the short celebration, 1960 Decathlon
gold-medalist Rafer Johnson lit a torch from the flame in a bowl
brought to the Coliseum by a helicopter from the Los Angeles
International Airport, where the flame arrived from Greece by a
special chartered flight this morning.
</P>
<P>
Johnson, the last runner in the torch relay across the country
for the 1984 Los Angeles Olympic Games, held the torch aloft and
then set off on the first leg of the 25,000-kilometer, 84-day
relay to Atlanta, where the 17-day Games will begin on July 19.
</P>
<P>
He ran into the street from the stadium and handed the torch to
Gina Tillman, granddaughter of Jesse Owens, 4-gold medalist at the
1936 Berlin Games.
</P>
<P>
The flame will be carried by 10,000 runners representing more
than 100 countries to cover a land of 42 states and the District
of Columbia of the host nation to Atlanta in time for the Games,
which will be participated by over 10,000 athletes from some 197
countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
The torch relay will also include bicycle, horseback, boat,
plane and car travels, according to the Atlanta Committee for
Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
The Olympic flame was handed over by Greece on Friday in a
ceremony at the marble Panathenean Stadium in Athens where the
Olympics were revived in 1896.
</P>
<P>
The flame was handed to William Payne after a month's relay
throughout Greece.
</P>
<P>
The flame was lit from the sun's rays on March 30 in the
western pagan sanctuary of ancient Olympic where the Olympics was
Born in 776 BC.
</P>
<P>
Since 1936 Berlin Games, a flame lit in Olympia has opened the
games to underscore the continuation of the ideals of the ancient
Greeks in the modern Olympics.

<HEADLINE> New Chechen Separatist Leader Killed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 29 (Xinhua) -- New Chechen separatist leader
Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev, who replaced slain leader Dzhokhar Dudayev
a week ago, was killed in an internal clash Sunday night, a
Moscow-backed Chechen government spokesman said today.
</P>
<P>
Yandarbiyev was killed "in a clash between Chechen militants
near the settlement of Urus-Martan, 20 kilometers of Grozny
(Chechen capital)," Ruslan Martagov, a personal representative of
the pro-Moscow Chechen leader Doku Zavgayev, told the Itar-Tass
news agency.
</P>
<P>
However, there has been no confirmation of Yandarbiyev's death
from Chechen separatists.
</P>
<P>
Itar-Tass quoted Martagov as saying, "The killing of
Yandarbiyev is connected with a gangland war among the militants
which has been going on for some time in the Urus-Martan
district."
</P>
<P>
Yandarbiyev, 44, took over as leader of the Chechen rebels
after Dudayev was killed by a Russian missile attack on the
village of Gekhi-Chu on April 21. He had been vice-president of
Dudayev's self-styled Chechen Republic of Ichkeria since April
1993.
</P>
<P>
Yandarbiyev is most likely to be replaced by the chief of staff
of the separatist forces, Aslan Maskahdov, reports reaching here
said.
</P>
<P>
However, the reports added, Maskahdov may face tough
competition from noted "irreconcilable" chieftain Shamir Basayev,
who led the notorious raid on the southern Russian town of
Budennovsk last summer.
</P>
<P>
The decision on Yandarbiyev's successor will be made at a
session of the rebels' Military Council within two days, the
reports said.
</P>
<P>
Maskhadov is believed to be a moderate in Dudayev's immediate
circle and most suitable for peace talks with Moscow, which had
hoped Maskhadov would replace Dudayev as leader.
</P>
<P>
Russian President Boris Yeltsin launched a peace plan for
Chechnya on March 31, which included talks with Dudayev.
</P>
<P>
More than 30,000 people have been killed in the Chechen
conflict.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Police Chief Warns of Terrorist Attacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 29 (Xinhua) -- A senior Israeli police
officer said here today that terrorist groups may try to
carry out attacks in Israel to sabotage the upcoming general
elections.
</P>
<P>
Assaf Hefez, police inspector-general, made the remarks to
reporters following a meeting with top police commanders to
conclude arrangements for the upcoming elections
</P>
<P>
The Knesset (Israel's parliament) elections are scheduled to
be held on May 29, during which, a new Israeli prime minister will
be elected directly for the first time since the establishment of
the State of Israel.
</P>
<P>
Hefez said that some 20,000 police and security forces will
be deployed on the election day at more than 600,000 polling
stations nationwide to provide security and maintain public
order.
</P>
<P>
Each police officer will be equipped with a special
guideline prepared by the Attorney-General's office on how to
deal with any irregularity, the police chief added.
</P>
<P>
Despite the recent crack down on Islamic extremist groups by
the Israeli and Palestinian security forces, terrorist groups
still have the capability to launch attacks, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Israel had implemented a number of new security measures
following a series of suicide bombing attacks in late February
and early March, which killed at least 60 people and wounded
over 150 others.
</P>
<P>
Izzadine Kassam, military wing of the Islamic Resistance
Movement, or Hamas, claimed responsible for the suicide bombing
attacks on buses in Jerusalem and outside a shopping center
in Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian police have arrested hundreds of Hamas and
Islamic Jihad activists in an effort to crack down on the
extremist groups operating inside the Palestinian autonomous
areas.
</P>
<P>
However, Hamas said last week that the group will continue its
military struggle against Israel despite the fact that the
Palestinian National Council voted to amend the Palestinian
Charter, which calls for Israel's destruction on April 24.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The Ulster Unionist Party (UUP)
said today that it is setting up a "Unionist Information Office"
in London to raise the profile of unionism in Britain, reported
BBC TV this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
David Burnide, a leading member of the UUP said that this
Unionist Information Office (UIO) will be in full operation within
eight weeks and the name NIO had been chosen as a "serious dig" at
the activities of Britain's Northern Ireland Office (NIO).
</P>
<P>
Burnide complained: "Since the NIO no longer supports and acts
as persuaders for the union, the UIO in London will."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile the UUP has been angered at the secret talks between
the British government and Sinn Fein, political wing of the Irish
Republican Army (IRA).
</P>
<P>
Deputy leader of the UUP John Taylor said the secret meetings
increased fears that the British government was "going behind
backs to try to reach a secret deal with Sinn Fein and the IRA.
</P>
<P>
Taylor complained that "no one knows when to believe this
government" and he described meetings between the government and
Sinn Fein as "a total breach of trust with the greater number of
people in Northern Ireland".
</P>
<P>
Both the British government and Sinn Fein confirmed Sunday that
they had opened up a secret channel of communications through
senior conservative member of parliament and former Northern
Ireland minister Michael Mates as a go-between.
</P>
<P>
But both sides also stressed the two meetings between Mates and
Sinn Fein involved a frank exchange of views and little progress
had been made.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Crack Water Chestnuts Crisp Secret </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 29 (Xinhua) -- British scientists have unlocked
the secret to why water chestnuts remain crisp after cooking, and
now aim to use it to develop soggy-free vegetables.
</P>
<P>
They believe they will also be able to engineer a new breed of
fruit and vegetables that defy the characteristics of their
natural counterparts and remain firm even after prolonged boiling.
</P>
<P>
The discovery is the fruit of two years' hard work by
researchers at the Norwich Institute of Food Research. They
believed that if they could find out why water chestnuts remain
crisp, even after lengthy boiling, they would be able to provide
the public with fruit and vegetables that retain a crunchy texture
even after being cooked, canned or microwaved.
</P>
<P>
The researchers have discovered the secret lies in the nut's
cell wall lining, according to a press release of the institute
available here today.
</P>
<P>
The key is that nearly half of the ferulic acid molecules
lining the cells join together to form diferulic acid.
</P>
<P>
By joining together, the acidic molecules form a strong bond
that can resist the pressure on cells when heated. This gives a
crisp texture when bitten because the cell linings are still
strongly bound and so provide resistance to the teeth.
</P>
<P>
This contrasts with the unpleasant soggy feel of fruit or
vegetables whose cell wall lining has been broken down by cooking,
providing no resistance to a bite.
</P>
<P>
The scientists now know that if consumers are to enjoy firmer
produce, they need to encourage the ferulic acid molecules to bond
with a partner molecule and form diferulic acid.
</P>
<P>
The team is now trying to identify the correct enzyme to make
this bond. It could be added to fruit and vegetables before they
are packaged.
</P>
<P>
Keith Waldron, who heads the research team, believes this
procedure will provide the key to soggy-free fruit and vegetables.
</P>
<P>
By adding the enzyme that links the acid molecules together,
Waldron says mass produced convenience food could be made with the
characteristics of fresh, firm produce.

<HEADLINE> S. Korean Ex-President's Aides to Be Imprisoned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The South Korean prosecution today
demanded prison terms ranging from five to seven years for four
accused in connection with the bribery scandal involving former
President Chun Doo-hwan.
</P>
<P>
The prosecution's demands came in the third trial session of
Chun's graft case held at the Seoul District Court this morning.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors demanded that Ahn Hyun-tae, former chief
presidential bodyguard, be sentenced to a seven-year imprisonment
and an additional fine of 64,000 U.S. dollars on charges of aiding
Chun to collect 35.9 million dollars in bribes from businessmen
and receiving 64,000 U.S. dollars in bribes himself.
</P>
<P>
Sung Yong-wook, a former national tax administrator charged of
aiding Chun to collect 35.9 million U.S. dollars from two
companies and collecting himself 6.99 million dollars from 11
companies for it to be conveyed to Chun, was demanded to be given
six years in prison and an additional fine of 2.33 million
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
A five-year imprisonment and an additional fine of 2.33 million
dollars was demanded for Ahn Moo-hyuk, former director of the
Agency for National Security Planning, while a five-year
imprisonment alone was demanded for Sagong Il, former finance
minister.
</P>
<P>
Ahn Hyun-tae testified at today's hearing that in late 1987
Chun personally gave 192.3 million dollars of secret political
fund collected from businessmen to Roh Tae-woo as the then ruling
Democratic Justice Party's presidential candidate.
</P>
<P>
Chun, who was arrested on December 3 last year, was indicted on
January 12 this year on charges that he raised about 900 million
dollars of secret fund while in office from 42 major business
leaders. Of that amount 270 million dollars was confirmed to be
from bribes.
</P>
<P>
Chun seized power on August 27, 1980, and ruled the nation
until February 1988. He was followed by Roh Tae-woo who stepped
down in February 1993.
</P>
<P>
Roh, who was taken into custody on November 16 last year after
being arrested, has stood trial three times already as he also
faces charges of receiving 370 million dollars in bribes from
businessmen while in office.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the graft charges, Both Chun and Roh are also
being tried for insurrection and treason for their leading roles
in the military mutiny on December 12, 1979 and the military
crackdown on the movement of May 18, 1980 in Kwangju, capital of
South Korea's South Cholla Province.

<HEADLINE> Oman Expects Kazakh Pipeline to Work in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The Government of Oman expected
that the pipeline of Kazakhstan linking Tengiz oil field to the
Black Sea will operate in 1998, the official Omani News Agency,
ONA, reported today.
</P>
<P>
Omani Commerce and Industry Minister Maqbool Bin Ali Bin Sultan
said the Sultanate, a parter in the 1.2 billion U.S. dollars
venture, is looking forward to the success of the efforts that
would enable them to make the first delivery in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Oman, Kazakhstan and Russia Saturday signed a protocol in
Alma-Ata, capital of Kazakhstan, for the restructuring the Caspian
Pipeline Consortium (CPC) they formed in 1992. Russia will have a
share of 44 percent, Kazakhstan has 19 percent and Oman's share
fell to 7 percent from 50 percent four years ago.
</P>
<P>
The remaining parts belong to U.S. companies Chevron, Mobil and
Oryx, Iraly's Agip, British Gas and two Russian companies, Lukoil
and Rosneft.
</P>
<P>
The pipeline will link Kazakhstan's giant Tengiz oil field to
the Black Sea through Russia. The Tengiz oil field, with reserves
of between 6 and 9 billion barrels, is being developed under a 20
billion dollars joint venture with the U.S. Chevron Corp.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the oil field output is set to peak at
700,000 barrels per day, bpd, by 2010, up from 100,000 bpd now.

<HEADLINE> Notebook Makers to Cut Prices for Greater Market Share </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Personal computer (PC) makers are
about to launch a price war for more market share in the notebook
sector, local press said today.
</P>
<P>
According to the Sunday Times report, notebook buyers can
expect unheard-of bargains in the months to come, and the price of
a portable computer is likely to be only about 100 pounds (about
U.S. dollars) above its desktop equivalent within a year.
</P>
<P>
Key players in the market, including IBM, Compaq and Toshiba,
are set to announce lower-price models in the next few weeks. But
the pace of the market will be set by the ambitious direct
manufacturer Dell, thought to be number four in worldwide sales.
</P>
<P>
American PC company Dell will announce drastic price cuts on
new machines. It will confine its offerings to mid-range notebooks
from about 1,700 pounds (2,550 dollars) to 2,400 pounds (3,600
dollars).
</P>
<P>
All machines in the range will be Pentium-based, and the most
expensive will feature the fastest 133MHz chip, 16 megabytes of
RAM, multimedia sound, long-life lithium ion batteries and the
latest 11.3 inch SVGA TFT screen, a level of specification that
would have cost 5,000 pounds (7,500 dollars) only two months ago.
</P>
<P>
Analysts also believe that the deployment of PCs on internal
corporate networks will lead to notebooks replacing conventional
desktops for normal use.
</P>
<P>
Apart from war in price and performance in the notebook field,
there is also competition on size. Digital has hit gold in America
with its release of an 1.1 inch-thick Windows notebook, which has
sold out only five weeks after launch. New buyers may have to wait
two months for delivery.
</P>
<P>
Both IBM and Compaq are thought to be planning their own
ultra-thin notebooks to compete with Digital. IBM's rumored
ThinkPad 560, due to be launched next month, is expected to boast
a new 12.1 inch TFT screen housed in a unit that is only 1.25 inch
thick.
</P>
<P>
The flood of new product launches may mean bargain prices for
buyers, but some confusion too.
</P>
<P>
Many existing notebook lines are still in stock with retailers,
and likely to be discounted heavily into the market as they become
obsolete. But the fast-falling price of high-end Pentium models
may make older ones a poor buy unless the price cuts are
dramatic.

ULAN BATOR, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Thirteen people have been
killed, 34 injured and hundreds of others forced to flee their
homes by forest and grassland fires which have been raging across
Mongolia for weeks, a senior government official said today.
</P>
<P>
The 72 fires, which have spread to 13 of the 21 Mongolian
provinces, have also killed more than 5,000 animals, destroyed 117
tents, 191 farms and 667 wire poles, the official said.
</P>
<P>
More than 24,000 people and 1,000 vehicles have been sent in to
put out the fires and the government has so far spent 374 million
tugriks (800,000 U.S. dollars) on the rescue operation, said
Bayala, secretary-general of Mongolia's Standing Emergency
Commission in charge of fire-fighting and relief work.
</P>
<P>
He said that President Punsalmaagiyn Ochirbat and Prime
Minister Puntsagiyn Jasray today called on the whole nation to

</P>
<P>
Mongolia has appealed for international emergency assistance in
fighting the fires.
</P>
<P>
The northwestern province of Bulgan is the hardest-hit, with 25
forests and acres of pasture land ablaze, followed by Khobsgol and
Tub provinces, stricken by 12 fires and 9 fires respectively,
Bayala said.
</P>
<P>
Fifteen percent of Mongolia, the world's largest landlocked

<HEADLINE> South Korea Holds Sixth Trial of Two Former Presidents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Former South Korean President Chun
Doo-hwan admitted here today that the extensive merger of press
media in late 1980 was his idea.
</P>
<P>
Chun made the confession at the sixth trial session on mutiny
and treason charges involving Chun and another former President,
Roh Tae-woo, as well as some of their fellow generals and colonels
at the Seoul District Court this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Standing trial at the court were Chun and Roh as well as nine
close aides of Chun, including Hwang Young-shi, former first army
corps commander.
</P>
<P>
"The press merger plan was worked out by the then Information
Minister Lee Kwang-pyo, but the plan was my idea," Chun said in
the trial.
</P>
<P>
The disgraced former president, however, declined to talk about
the role of the Defense Security Command, headed then by Roh
Tae-woo, in the press merger. Roh's command was said to have
stage-managed the merger.
</P>
<P>
The prosecution also questioned Chun if he did not apply a sort
of indirect pressure to the justices of the Supreme Court so that
the highest court could mete out heavy term to opposition leader
Kim Dae-jung then on trial on sedition charges.
</P>
<P>
Chun ducked the question, saying that he could not remember the
action he took regarding the matter.
</P>
<P>
A total of 16 former South Korean army officers including Chun
and Roh have been indicted for mutiny and treason. The mutiny and
treason charges respectively stem from their roles in the military
revolt on December 12, 1979 and in the bloody crackdown of the
civil uprising on May 18, 1980 in Kwangju, capital of South
Korea's South Cholla Province.
</P>
<P>
Chun, who loomed large as the army strongman after the 1979
military mutiny, seized power on August 27, 1980, and ruled the
country until February 1988. He was followed by Roh, who stepped
down in February 1993.
</P>
<P>
The two ex-presidents, who were arrested last year, have also
been indicted for graft as they received huge bribes from
businessmen while in office.
</P>
<P>
Both Chun and Roh have already stood trial three times each
respectively on the graft charges.
</P>
<P>
The seventh trial session on mutiny and treason charges will be
held on May 6.

<HEADLINE> Hariri Reiterates Bases of Lebanon's Position </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik
Al-Hariri reiterated here today the bases of the Lebanese
government's position over peace with Israel, including
implementation of U.N. Security Council Resolution 425.
</P>
<P>
Resolution 425 calls for Israeli withdrawal from all the
Lebanese territories, the Lebanese prime minister stressed in a
press conference held in his office tonight.
</P>
<P>
The other bases of his government's position are adhering to
the principles of the 1991 Madrid conference on the Middle Ease
peace process, and the interlocking between the Syrian and
Lebanese tracks, Hariri noted.
</P>
<P>
He said that the United States is required to play an
effective role in advancing the peace process in the region.
</P>
<P>
On a cease-fire understanding which put an end to the 17 days
of fighting between Israel and the Lebanese pro-Iranian Hezbollah,
or Party of God, the Lebanese premier said, "The enforcement of
the April understanding is within the responsibility of the
Lebanese state."
</P>
<P>
He said that the resistance is a means of liberation, adding
that the highest national interest is in the liberation of part of
Lebanon's lands from Israel's occupation.
</P>
<P>
"All can live together in a framework of the April
understanding and it is not in the interest of the resistance to
confront with the government," the prime minister said, adding
that the April understanding "fully guarantees security of the
civilians."
</P>
<P>
"We will work to comply with the understanding in order to
prevent what had happened from repeating and to defend our people
in southern Lebanon, western Bekaa and all other areas," the prime
minister vowed.
</P>
<P>
He denied any secret agreement complementing the April
understanding.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question on whether the government would make
re-arrangement of its priorities after the damages caused by the
Israeli military operations, the prime minister said, "One of the
Israeli purposes was to strike the (Lebanese) government's project
because of its success, so why the government should change its
programs?"
</P>
<P>
Because of international pressures and mediation efforts made
by the United States, France and others, the cease-fire went into
effect at 4:00 a.m. (01:00 GMT) Saturday after some 200 Lebanese
were killed and four hundred others were wounded since Israel
launched Operation Grapes of Wrath on April 11.
</P>
<P>
Half a million refugees, who had been displaced by the
continuous Israeli air raids and bombardments from their
homelands in south Lebanon, have begun to return to their
villages.
</P>
<P>
A funeral ceremony is scheduled to be held Tuesday for some 110
people who were killed in an Israeli air strike at a military camp
of the Fijian contingent of the U.N. peacekeeping force near the
southern Lebanese town of Kana on April 18.

Peninsula," is actually busy preparing for war.

<HEADLINE> Conference on Taiwan Closes in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 29 (Xinhua) -- A three-day working conference on
Taiwan was closed here today.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Premier Qian Qichen addressed the conference. Wang
Zhaoguo, director of both the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State
Council and the Office of Taiwan Work of the Central Committee of
the Communist Party of China (CPC), delivered a working report on
the conference.
</P>
<P>
Qian Qichen said the important speech given by President Jiang
Zemin on behalf of the CPC Central Committee and the central
government, "Continue to promote the reunification of the
motherland", reflected the basic principle of "peaceful
reunification, one country, two systems" put forward by Deng
Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
The speech has a great realistical significance and a long-term
guiding function, Qian said.
</P>
<P>
The conference holds that the serious setback and retrogression
occured to the relations across the Taiwan Straits hence after
mid-1995 is completely caused by some leaders of the Taiwan
authorities who have been engaged in activities purposed to split
China, in colluding with foreign anti-China forces.
</P>
<P>
The conference believes that the Chinese people's anti-split
and anti-Taiwan-Independence struggle under the leadership of the
CPC Central Committee and the State Council has rendered a severe
strike on forces seeking "Taiwan independence" and on splittists
on the island, and reflected the Chinese people's determination and
capability in safeguarding the sovereignty and territorial
integrity of China.
</P>
<P>
The conference reinterates that the reunification of China is a
pure internal affair of China, and that no foreign forces are
allowed to meddle in it in any form.
</P>
<P>
The conference notes that new headways have been made in the
past year in the economic and trade relations and people-to-people
exchanges across the Taiwan Straits. It decided to further promote
the economic co-operation and other exchanges across the straits.
</P>
<P>
The conference holds that the Taiwan authorities should truly
return to the one China principle by stopping producing "two
Chinas", or "one China, one Taiwan" internationally, so as to
create the conditions and atmosphere necessary for easing and
developing the relations across the straits.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the office of Taiwan affairs of localities and
central government departments, took part in the meeting.

the Dayton Peace Agreement.
</P>
<P>
NATO said in the declaration that IFOR will continue to assist
their efforts in such areas as the conduct of elections, the return

<HEADLINE> Round-up:  Greece and Turkey Closer to Compromise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Greece and Turkey, two Nato member
nations, are closer to a compromise on the dispute in the Aegean
following a meeting between the two countries' foreign ministers
last week in Bucharest.
</P>
<P>
The compromise deal, struck on Saturday on the sidelines of the
Black Sea economic cooperation meeting between Theodoros Pangalos
and Emre Gonensay, showed the first sign of understanding since
the two countries nearly went to war in January over Aegean island
of Imia.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Greece has agreed to direct talks with
Turkey over the Aegean on condition that the two sides would agree
to international arbitration if key differences remained.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Foreign Minister Gonensay reportedly said he and
Pangalos had agreed on a procedure for talks.
</P>
<P>
According to the procedure, the two ministers would send
experts to Switzerland to assess ambiguous points in a treaty
covering the Aegean and prepare the ground for bilateral talks at
a Nato meeting in Berlin at the beginning of June.
</P>
<P>
Gonensay said he was confident his meeting with Pangalos was a
good start and would reduce tension.
</P>
<P>
The Greek government, which has blocked EU aid to Turkey
following the Imia Island incident, is apparently satisfied at the
result of the Pangalos-Gonensay meeting.
</P>
<P>
"Saturday's meeting was considered as a positive step in re-
establishing contacts between the Greek and Turkish foreign
ministers," a government official said.
</P>
<P>
Pangalos told reporters upon his return to Athens from
Bucharest that Gonensay had assured him Turkey had no territorial
claims on Greece and wanted to develop friendly relations with
Greece.
</P>
<P>
Greek government spokesman Dimitris Reppas today stressed "if
Turkey rids its policy from the claims on our territorial
integrity, Greece will respond affirmatively", adding that the
new Turkish foreign minister was refraining from using the phrase
"casus belli" with regard to Greece's right to extend its
territorial waters to 12 miles in the Aegean.

<HEADLINE> EU Round Table Meeting on Employment Ends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 29 (Xinhua) -- A round table meeting organized
by the European Commission(EC) with representatives of both sides
of business ended here today with participants agreed to make
joint efforts to tackle the unemployment in the European
Union(EU).
</P>
<P>
During the two-day encounter, more than 70 participants
discussed the employment situation in the EU and raised various
proposals aimed at restorating "a climate of confidence" which is,
said the EC, a prior condition for a recovery in investment and
consumption.
</P>
<P>
The social partners(companies and trade unions) assembled at
the round table stressed the need to "act in concert" at the
appropriate levels, the EU, Member States, industry-wide, company
level, in a strategic framework.
</P>
<P>
According to the meeting's Conclusion, a so-called "interlinked
undertakings" will have to come into being over the next few
months.
</P>
<P>
"If we are to succeed in this, it is important for everyone to
take a step in the other side's direction," the Conclusion said.
</P>
<P>
This means, stated the Conclusion: firms must agree to place
investment and employment at the top of their agenda; employees
must accept a less corporatist form of labour market and the
authorities must undertake to promote a general framework which is
favorable to business competitiveness and which can give rise to
a more solidarity-oriented society.
</P>
<P>
To modernize the labour market, it said, there is need for
positive forms of working flexibility, to reduce labour costs and
to enhance vocational training.
</P>
<P>
According to latest figures from EUROSTAT, the statistical
office of the European Communities, about 18.3 million people are
now unemployed in the European Union, a jobless rate of 11
percent.
</P>
<P>
In the wake of this round table meeting, the Italian Presidency
of the EU's Council of Ministers will organize a three-sided
conference in mid-June, between governments, employers/workers and
the EC to discuss growth and employment in the countdown to the EU
Summit in Florence, on June 21/22.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Police Chief Warns of Terrorist Attacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 29 (Xinhua) -- A senior Israeli police
officer said here today that terrorist groups may try to
carry out attacks in Israel to sabotage the upcoming general
elections.
</P>
<P>
Assaf Hefez, police inspector-general, made the remarks to
reporters following a meeting with top police commanders to
conclude arrangements for the upcoming elections
</P>
<P>
The Knesset (Israel's parliament) elections are scheduled to
be held on May 29, during which, a new Israeli prime minister will
be elected directly for the first time since the establishment of
the State of Israel.
</P>
<P>
Hefez said that some 20,000 police and security forces will be
deployed on the election day at more than 6,000 polling stations
nationwide to provide security and maintain public order.
</P>
<P>
Each police officer will be equipped with a special
guideline prepared by the Attorney-General's office on how to
deal with any irregularity, the police chief added.
</P>
<P>
Despite the recent crack down on Islamic extremist groups by
the Israeli and Palestinian security forces, terrorist groups
still have the capability to launch attacks, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Israel had implemented a number of new security measures
following a series of suicide bombing attacks in late February
and early March, which killed at least 60 people and wounded
over 150 others.
</P>
<P>
Izzadine Kassam, military wing of the Islamic Resistance
Movement, or Hamas, claimed responsible for the suicide bombing
attacks on buses in Jerusalem and outside a shopping center
in Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian police have arrested hundreds of Hamas and
Islamic Jihad activists in an effort to crack down on the
extremist groups operating inside the Palestinian autonomous
areas.
</P>
<P>
However, Hamas said last week that the group will continue its
military struggle against Israel despite the fact that the
Palestinian National Council voted to amend the Palestinian
Charter, which calls for Israel's destruction on April 24.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Last-Minute Constitutional Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 29 (Xinhua)-- Talks on South Africa's
outstanding constitutional issues got under way today as the
constitutional assembly (CA ) geared itself for a nine-day spurt
to adopt the final constitution next week, the South African
Press Association reported today.
</P>
<P>
Following Sunday's summit between President Nelson Mandela and
Deputy President F W De Klerk, both the African National Congress
(ANC ) and the National Party (NP) were consulting interest
groups on crucial aspects today.
</P>
<P>
During last night's crucial discussions, the ANC and NP
reached an agreement in principle on three of the four
outstanding issues included in the new constitution, relating to
the lock-out of strikers, property rights, the language and
education.
</P>
<P>
It is understood that the ANC was discussing the controversial
lock-out clause with the Congress of South African Trade Unions
(COSATU ), which called a one-day nationwide strike last Tuesday
to demand the exclusion of the clause from the final
constitution.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the NP was talking to education interest groups
about the latest proposals on the education clauses. The NP had
also committed itself to hearing further views from business
groups on the property clauses, which was looming as possibly the
biggest stumbling block to getting the two-thirds majority needed
for the CA to pass the constitution by the May 9 deadline, set by
the interim constitution two year ago.
</P>
<P>
However, both parties were also consulting within their own
ranks in a bid to get ready with their final positions when the
CA's Constitutional Committee (CC ) met later in the day to hear
about the report-backs on the multi-lateral and bilateral talks
over the almost 300 amendments tabled last Thursday to the
constitution bill.
</P>
<P>
The CC was girding itself for a late-night or even all-night
sitting as it was committed to completing the amended draft of
the final constitution for the final drafting and printing
process to begin from Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Major, Kohl Discuss EU Beef Ban At Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 29 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister John Major
and visiting German Chancellor Helmut Kohl discussed here today
the European Union (EU) ban on British beef exports and urged for
swift EU action on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a joint press conference after the Anglo-German
summit at No. 10 Downing Street this afternoon, Major said that he
and his German counterpart have discussed the difficulties facing
the British beef industry and EU ban on British beef.
</P>
<P>
Major expressed the hope that the EU conference in Luxembourg
on the British proposal of wiping out the BSE or mad cow disease
would achieve some progress of relaxing the ban.
</P>
<P>
"I am very much looking forward to an early lifting of the
world-wide ban and the EU conference will achieve some positive
results on that direction," he said.
</P>
<P>
Kohl, who has eaten British beef for lunch earlier today,
pointed out that the British proposal of slaughtering some 40,000
cows "should be discussed as speedily as possible".
</P>
<P>
Asked if British beef is safe to eat, the German leader refused
to give a clear-cut answer, saying "it is not fair for a German
government leader to make a comment on that matter, while the
proposal is being discussed by the EU partners."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, British Agriculture Minister Douglas Hogg is
reported by the BBC television as saying "it would be a great
disappointment if we do not make progress and I would hope we can
secure some steps towards a lifting of the ban."
</P>
<P>
It is reported that Hogg will meet his EU counterparts later
today in Luxembourg to discuss the latest British proposal of
eliminating the BSE.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Visiting United Nations
Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali today reviewed peace
issues in Africa with Kenyan President Denial arap Moi who
pledged full support to the U.N. peace mission.
</P>
<P>
A press release issued by the U.N. Information Center in
Nairobi said the two leaders, during their 30-minute talks, made
special emphasis in the situations in Africa's war-torn countries
like Burundi, Somalia, Sudan and Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
President Moi promised that Kenya, as an important country in
the sub-region, would be committed to seeking peaceful ways to
end years of civil wars in these countries.
</P>
<P>
Ghali, who is currently in Nairobi to chair a three-day U.N.
Global Conferences which opened on Sunday, also reviewed a series
of U.N. initiatives to reverse the trend towards marginalisation
of Africa.
</P>
<P>
They included the U.N. System-Wide Initiative for Africa and
the current ninth U.N. Conference on Trade and Development in
South Africa. The U.N. chief said the focus of the high-level
meeting was on the implementation of the U.N.'s new Initiative on
Africa.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief promised further development of the U.N.'s
global approach to implementing the Programs of Action adopted at
the various international meetings sponsored by the U.N. over the
past three years.
</P>
<P>
The holding of the Nairobi U.N. Global Conference reflects the
focus of the session on African Development, he added.
</P>
<P>
All the executive heads of the U.N. organisations and agencies
attended the meeting. It was the first time that the U.N. held
its global meeting in a developing country.

<HEADLINE> Basayev Likely to Become Chechen Real Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Chechen rebel field commander
Shamil Basayev, who led a terrorist raid on Budnnovsk in southern
Russia last summer, has been appointed as the commander-in-chief
of the Chechen separatist forces, the Itar-Tass news agency said
tonight.
</P>
<P>
It cited "sources close to the Chechen separatists" as noting
that the appointment was made early Sunday even before Zelimkhan
Yandarbiyev had been killed Sunday night in a clash between
Chechen rebels near the village of Gekhi in Urus-Martan district,
20 kilometers south of Grozny.
</P>
<P>
Yandarbiyev, 44, succeeded Chechen separatist leader Dzhokhar
Dudayev last week after the latter was killed on April 21
reportedly by a Russian missile strike. Yandarbiyev, a writer and
chief ideologue of the separatist movement in Chechnya, had been
Vice-President of Dudayev's regime.
</P>
<P>
The sources said Basayev, 31, will have powers close o those
that Dudayev had, but he will deal primarily with military, not
political issues.
</P>
<P>
The question of who will become the President of the so-called
"Chechen Republic of Ichkeria" remains open so far.
</P>
<P>
Basayev was born in the Chechen village f Vedeno in 1965. He
graduated from a high school in 1982. In 1987, he studied in
Moscow Institute of Lan Engineers, but a year later he was
expelled for bad performance. However, some reports say that
Basayev graduated from the institute with a diploma.
</P>
<P>
On November 9, 1991, Basayev hijacked a Tu-154 passenger plane
from Mineralnye Vody to Turkey where he and his accomplices
surrendered to the local authorities and, after negotiations,
returned to Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
Following the plane hijacking, Basayev was put in charge of
Duayev's task-force company.
</P>
<P>
From the end of 1991 to the beginning of 1992, Basayev was
reported to have fought in Nagorno-Karabakh on the Azerbaijani
side and trained at Mujahideen center in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Since August 1992, Basayev had been actively involved in combat
activities in Abkhazia, a breakaway region in Georgia, and
commanded a unit of Chechen volunteers, which later became the
so-called "Abkhazia Battalion."
</P>
<P>
In the summer 1994, with the outbreak of the civil war in
Chechnya, Basayev began fighting on the side of Dudayev's forces,
and became one of the rebel field commanders.
</P>
<P>
On June 14-20, 1995, Basayev led a raid on the city of
Budennovsk in Russia's Stavropol region where he seized hundreds
of civilian hostage in a bid to force Moscow to stop fighting in
Chechnya and begin talks with the Chechen separatists.

<HEADLINE> Moscow Makes Statement on Efforts Over Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Moscow stated today that the
formation of an observer group to monitor the implementation of an
agreement in Lebanon without Russia's participation is a "clear
underestimation" of its efforts and its status as co-sponsor of
the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Foreign Ministry noted in a statement that Russia,
in coordination with France and the European Union (EU) as well as
in cooperation with the United States (U.S.)and Iran, made a
"considerable contribution" to reach a compromise.
</P>
<P>
"The chief goal of today has been achieved -- the sides have
signed a ceasefire agreement aimed first of all at ensuring the
security of civilians and civilian facilities," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
It pointed out that work is underway to set up mechanism of
guarantees and control under which Russia, the U.S., France and the
EU will set up a consultative group.
</P>
<P>
Russia fully supports the results of collective efforts and
joint mediation to normalize the situation in southern Lebanon,
the Statement stressed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it pointed out that the compromise is an temporary
settlement.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the statement said the Russian Foreign Ministry,
while attaching special significance to the resumption of a
full-fledged negotiating process on the Syrian-Israeli and
Lebanese-Israeli tracks, believes that the question of holding a
forum, similar to the Madrid conference, in the future should not
be removed from the agenda.

<P>
LUSAKA, Spril 29 (Xinhua)-- Zambian Auditor-General Frederick
Siame today appealed to member states of the Southern African
Development Community (SADC) to attach more importance to the
training of auditors in the region.
</P>
<P>
Siame made the appeal at opening of a three-day SADC workshop on
auditing in Lusaka.
</P>
<P>
Siame said rapid changes taking place in the SADC region required
good governance, proper auditing and transparency.
</P>
<P>
To ensure the proper management of public funds, the principles of
responsibily and accountability should be implementd by those
charged with collection of government revenues and those charged with
the expending of such resources, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
All this could only be achieved if the audit offices were equipped
with competent staff who could handle modern techniques in auditing
and equipment, Siame added.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from SADC member states attended the workshop.

<HEADLINE> Global Telecoms Deal Threatened by US Move </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, April 29 (Xinhua) -- World Trade Organization (WTO)
members might fail to meet a self-imposed deadline of April 30 to
reach a deal to liberalize the global telecommunications market.
</P>
<P>
This prediction came after the United States announced that it
was still unsatisfied with the quality and quantity of
market-opening offers from other countries.
</P>
<P>
EU trade commissioner Leon Brittan told reporters here that he
regarded it as a "profound disappointment" that the United States
had moved to the view that there was still not a sufficient
"critical mass" of countries who agreed to liberalize their
telecom market and that offers from Asian countries and Canada
were still inadequate.
</P>
<P>
A senior U.S. trade official later confirmed the U.S. view,
saying the U.S. was unsatisfied with offers from both the
developing countries and the developed one. He also indicated that
the U.S. would meet negotiators from its trading partners Tuesday
to press for more concessions.
</P>
<P>
Brittan, who came to Geneva for a special ministerial meeting
of the EU countries on telecoms negotiations, told reporters after
the meeting that the EU did not share the U.S. view that a
critical mass of offers was not yet available.
</P>
<P>
He said that there had been a large number of new and improved
offers in the last few days and weeks. If some outstanding issues
could be solved, he said, it would be sufficient to clinch a deal
by Tuesday's deadline.
</P>
<P>
"It has been an unpleasant surprise of the evolution of the
U.S. thinking on the issue. We're waiting to hear their proposal
as for what to do in such a situation," Brittan said, adding that
he hoped "overnight, wiser counsel will prevail."
</P>
<P>
The EU ministerial meeting had been convened to discuss further
improvement of the EU offer, in particular on whether to relax
remaining foreign ownership restrictions in telecoms markets of
France, Belgium, Spain and Portugal.
</P>
<P>
Brittan said that the meeting had shown "great flexibility" to
improve the EU offer provided that the U.S. would also improve its
offer in particular with regard to its limitation for the landing
of submarine cables. The EU also urged the U.S. to be more
forthcoming on liberalizing satellite communications.
</P>
<P>
The telecoms negotiation is one of the so-called unfinished
work of the Uruguay Round multilateral trade talks concluded at
the end of 1993. Over 50 WTO members have been working for two
years to forge a deal on the issue.
</P>
<P>
To date a total of 33 market-opening offers have been put on
table by the participants which cover over nine-tenths of global
telecom revenues of over 500 billion U.S. dollars a year.

LAGOS, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The federal government of Nigeria
will soon unveil a package for the refurbishing and re-equipping
of polytechnics in the country, the News Agency of Nigeria
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The package, which will be extended to the universities,

She did not elaborate on the package, but stressed that

</P>
<P>
According to the minister of state, there are disparities in
the funding, welfare package and the degree of recognition given
to the universities and polytechnics.
</P>
<P>
However, the continued search for technological breakthrough
has made it mandatory to put special attention to technical
education, she said, adding that this will involve adequately
funding the polytechnics and establishing craft and vocational
institutions as back ups.

<HEADLINE> Major, Kohl Hold Summit to Mend Impaired Fences </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 29 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister John Major
and visiting German Chancellor Helmut Kohl held a regular
Anglo-German summit here today in an effort to mend their impaired
fences.
</P>
<P>
The Anglo-German summit is held at a time when the relations
between the two principal European countries are in a dire strait,
according to local analysts.
</P>
<P>
It can be argued that the British and Germans have not
disagreed so profoundly since the end of the Second World War,
they said.
</P>
<P>
What is more, the Anglo-German conflicts center on the whole
blueprint of Europe, from the European Monetary Union to the
common European security and defense policies.
</P>
<P>
However, the tense relations seem to be a little relaxed from
the one-day summit talks between Major and Kohl, with both leaders
describing the talks as useful and positive.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a joint press conference here this afternoon, Kohl
said, "We should cooperate as closely as possible with our British
friends at this particular stage of European integration."
</P>
<P>
However, the same German leader has recently launched repeated
verbal attacks upon Britain, saying the slowest ship should not
determine the speed of the whole convoy.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in a much milder tone, Kohl said that the "common
European house" will probably be built by different stages of
developments, but it will come about."
</P>
<P>
"In building the European common house, we should bear in mind
the different traditions, different historical developments and
different geographical situations," Kohl said.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized it is important "we should bear each other's
interests in mind and should not be locked in philosophical
debate."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Major said that Britain and Germany share many
common views on the European single market, the enlargement of the
European Union and the peacekeeping mission in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, the two leaders also promised to promote
bilateral economic cooperation and strengthen contacts in other
fields.
</P>
<P>
Local political commentators say that although the two
countries have made some progress in mending their fences during
the one-day summit, their deep-rooted differences on the single
European currency, reforms of the European Union institutions and
other crucial issues concerning the future of Europe remained
unresolved.

<HEADLINE> UK Government Plans to Arm Every School with Computers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Tory government is
planning to buy 250,000 personal computers to install in every
school, the Financial Times newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
But this decision is a prelude of the battle with the
opposition Labor which put forth the notion at its annual
conference last October that every school would be armed with
computers so as to lead a UK information technology revolution.
</P>
<P>
Now the Conservative government has set up an ad hoc cabinet
committee chaired by Deputy Prime Minister Michael Heseltine to
develop a comprehensive IT strategy with an emphasis on education
and helping business.
</P>
<P>
The committee includes Trade and Industry Secretary Ian Lang,
Education and Employment Secretary Mrs Gillian Shephard and Public
Services Minister Roger Freeman. A team of officials is also
working full-time on the project.
</P>
<P>
Central to the committee's mandate is a deal with computer
makers for purchase of 250,000 PCs at a discount price of about
500 pounds (750 U.S. dollars) each, a total cost of 125 million
pounds (187.5 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
The members of the committee are confident that they can obtain
attractive terms although negotiations with computer manufacturers
have not yet started because the government is "offering a
tremendous opportunity to manufacturers to massively expand their
market."
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister John Major is also a computer enthusiast and is
reportedly devoting considerable time to educating himself on the
opportunities offered by IT.
</P>
<P>
In his keynote speech to Tories' mid-year conference last
month, he alluded to the initiative as a "project for the
millennium."
</P>
<P>
Both the Tories and Labor are convinced of the appeal to the
electorate of IT initiatives. Labor leader Tony Blair is planning
soon to announce proposals to provide school children with access
to thousands of computers.
</P>
<P>
Blair made an arrangement with British Telecom company to
provide connections to the information superhighway for all
schools, hospitals and colleges.

<HEADLINE> Slower Economic Growth Fuels Prospect of Rate Cut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Interest rate cuts appear to be
firmly back on the agenda in Britain after new figures on Monday
showed that economic growth remains sluggish.
</P>
<P>
Gross domestic product grew by 0.4 percent in the first quarter
of this year compared with 0.5 percent in the last quarter of
1995, figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show -
the slowest rate of growth for a year.
</P>
<P>
Growth in the first quarter compared with the same period a
year earlier was 2.0 percent, the same annual growth rate as the
previous quarter and lower than financial analysts expected.
</P>
<P>
The figures threw fresh doubt on the upbeat forecast by Kenneth
Clarke, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, for 3 percent annual
growth this year.
</P>
<P>
The data clearly illustrate the contrasting fortunes of
different sectors of the economy.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturing recorded virtually no growth, as companies worked
off stocks of unsold goods instead of stepping up new production,
and export sales dipped as key overseas markets faltered.
</P>
<P>
In contrast to manufacturing, the service sector continued to
enjoy robust growth, although at a slower rate than in previous
quarters.
</P>
<P>
Total service sector output grew by 0.5 percent in the first
quarter, compared with 0.8 percent in the previous quarter, and
was 2.8 percent higher than in the same period a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
Some economists said that the data has intensified pressure on
the Chancellor to cut interest rates to deliver faster growth
before the next general election, which must be held by mid-1997
at the latest.

<HEADLINE> UK Trade Gap at Its Widest for Almost Six Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Britain recorded its widest trade
gap, excluding oil and erratic items, for almost six years in
February as imports strengthened but key European exports markets
faltered, official statistics showed Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Office for National Statistics said that the UK's trade
deficit with the rest of the world widened from 1.42 billion
pounds (2.13 billion US dollars) in January to 1.54 billion
pounds (2.31 billion US dollars) in February.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the whole world deficit was reduced by the highest
oil trade surplus since 1986. Adjusting for oil and erratic items,
Britain's trade gap was 2.0 billion pounds (3 billion US dollars)
in February, the widest since April 1990.
</P>
<P>
In value terms, both exports and imports recorded a rise in
February, although imports were stronger than exports. The total
value of exports rose 1.5 percent between January and February to
13.4 billion pounds, whereas imports grew by 2.5 percent to 14.9
billion pounds.
</P>
<P>
Economists said they expected the trade gap with the rest of
the world to improve slightly during the next few months but then
to widen farther in the second half of this year.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Public health should not
be regarded as subsidiary to economic policies, nor should social
policies be seen as devices to compensate for the potentially
adverse health outcome of economic policies, according to a United
Nations Development Program (UNDP) study.
</P>
<P>
In the study "Health Implications of Economic Policies: A
Framework of Analysis" published by the UNDP, authors Sudhir Anand
and Lincoln Chen argued that an integrated approach is required
in which economic policies work to produce the required health
outcomes and health policies support economic productivity and
growth.
</P>
<P>
The paper noted that health expenditures have recently been
under pressure -- in industrial countries, in transition countries
and in developing countries. Health expenditure cuts have serious
negative effects though the consequences may not be prominent in
short term.
</P>
<P>
The argue that health status is a "stock" which depends on the
quantity and quality of previously built-up health assets and
current "flows" -- not only of health care but also of food,
income, environmental factors and behavior.
</P>
<P>
Mortality in fact may not rise immediately as a result of drop
in these flows brought by macroeconomic policies. However, lasting
deficits of the flows can produce disastrous result such as health
crisis in Russia, which has experienced about 1.3 million excess
deaths since its transition in 1989. The very severe economic
collapse in Russia: poverty, income inequality and unemployment
were identified as important mediating factors contributing to the
morality crisis, especially alarming increases of cardiovascular
and injury deaths.
</P>
<P>
The authors also suggested that privately supplied health care
needs to be regulated to play a more effective role in enabling
those in need.

<HEADLINE> British Police Arrest Soccer Ticket Touters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 30 (Xinhua) -- British police raided 12 ticket
outlets on Tuesday and arrested 11 people for illegal sales of
Euro 96 tickets.
</P>
<P>
Tickets for the European Football Championships tournament,
being staged in June, have yet to be distributed in Britain.
</P>
<P>
It is an offence under the Criminal Justice Act to tout tickets
for football matches, with a maximum 5,000 pounds (8,300
U.S. dollars) penalty.
</P>
<P>
A woman was arrested during the raid on Willis' National
Sporting Club, which occupies the penthouse suite at London's
Cafe Royal.
</P>
<P>
She was among a number of people arrested as a total of 80
officers mounted simultaneous raids across the English capital as
a part of Operation Potent.
</P>
<P>
The National Sporting Club was offering champagne deals for the
opening game in the Euro 96 championships for 300 pounds.
</P>
<P>
The Football Association (FA) said: "In recent months, the
Metropolitan Police through its Euro 96 Intelligence Unit has
asked for our support and we've readily given it. Today's action
is the first result," the FA said.
</P>
<P>
The Football Association said in a statement "Ticket touting is
illegal. It's highly damaging for our game."
</P>
<P>
The association also warned those tempted to purchase tickets
from touts that they could be forged or stolen -- and receiving
them may be illegal.

"National Model Worker" -- Xu Hu, a property maintenance worker,
Bao Qifan, a company manager, and Ma Guining, a department store
assistant.
</P>
<P>
Jiang expressed his appreciation for their excellent work in
their ordinary positions and said he hoped that they would continue

<HEADLINE> EU, Japan Agree to Promote Dialogue on Deregulation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Both the European Union (EU) and
Japan are willing to promote dialogue on deregulation, EU's Trade
Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan said today.
</P>
<P>
But, although relations between the two sides are "in good
shape", said Sir Leon, "We still have a long way to go before
Japan is as open to foreign imports and investment as Europe is.
</P>
<P>
"The EU will continue to press with force and persistence for a
deregulated and open Japanese economy," he said.
</P>
<P>
Sir Leon, vice-president of the European Commission (EC), was
speaking after a three-hour meeting between the EU officials and
Japanese Foreign Minister Yukihiko Ikeda and other Japanese
ministers to discuss trade and economics.
</P>
<P>
He said relations between the 15-nation EU and Japan are "in
good shape" but need to be improved further.
</P>
<P>
"We are focusing on a broad-based approach, building a mature
political relationship alongside our close economic ties," he said.
</P>
<P>
Although trade between the EU and Japan has grown rapidly, with
more and more European products exported to Japan, the EU has been
pressing Japan to make its market more open to European exports
and to remove the trade barriers between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
At a 1994 ministerial meeting in Tokyo between the two sides,
Brittan urged Japan to take steps to cut its trade surplus to the
EU, which suffered a trade deficit of 26.3 billion U.S. dollars
with Japan in 1993.
</P>
<P>
After today's meeting, Sir Leon said that since then, both
sides agreed that relations between the EU and Japan have
continued to improve and that EU-Japan trade has been increasing
at a faster rate than world trade.
</P>
<P>
But he pointed out that there was still a long way to go before
Japan's market was as open as the EU's.
</P>
<P>
At today's meeting, the two sides also discussed Euro-Asian
relations, the world economy and international trade.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese delegation held a special meeting with EC
President Jacques Santer here today.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Motives For Massacre Still Mystery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 30 (Xinhua) -- As Australian police, witnesses
and media struggled to put together the horrible picture of the
shooting incident on Sunday, a question was asked: Why a young man
killed 35 people in cold blood without even knowing most of them?
</P>
<P>
Martin Bryant, 28, was charged with murder at bedside in a
hospital where he is treated for burns to his back and buttocks
this morning.
</P>
<P>
But it maybe weeks or even months before people could get to
know why the blond, fresh-faced man picked up his victims with a
high-powered semi-automatic rifle in the street.
</P>
<P>
Police said that the gunman was to stay in hospital for at
least ten days while court hearings were held at his bedside in an
isolated room. There was a mammoth task faced by the police to
investigate the world's worst shooting massacre by a lone gunman,
which happened at Port Arthur in Tasmania early Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Grief and anger are deep. Tasmanian police released the names
of 26 victims this afternoon, including Madeline Mikac, 3, from
Tasmania and Ronald Jary, 71, from Victoria. Even the new Federal
Parliament that sat for the first day today paused briefly to
mourn for the Port Arthur victims. Flags flew at half mast on
commonwealth buildings around the country, including the
Parliament House.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Howard called for the nation to rethink after
the massacre. Criminal experts have put forward a number of
explanations of the gunman's motives.
</P>
<P>
British criminologists said that Bryant was probably a "spree
killer," who felt a sense of being humiliated and ignored, and
dreamed of inflicting pain and humiliation on the people he hated.
</P>
<P>
"Where you look...at things like isolation, a loner, possible
desire for revenge, a desire for status, a desire to be famous or
infamous, a desire to be a soldier or a commando who idolizes
guns," said forensic psychiatrist Gerald Bailes.
</P>
<P>
Police is yet to confirm whether the gunman is mentally ill or
intellectually disabled.
</P>
<P>
Rod Milton, an Australian expert on the psychology of mass
murderers, said that most mass killers were not mentally ill in
strict clinical sense.
</P>
<P>
"They are people who mostly don't have any diagnosable mental
illness," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The common thread is self-indulgence, a certain amount of
unhappiness and, the dangerous factor, they feel they are entitled
to do whatever they like to feel better," he said.
</P>
<P>
Bryant's former neighbors and schoolmates said that he was not
good at interact with people and would suddenly changed to a
totally different person.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that he used to threaten to shoot his late
father and former neighbors and was driven out of home. He used to
live lonely with a grown-up pet pig. Local press quoted his
18-year-old girlfriend as saying that he showed an increasing
interest in firearms before the massacre. Police had found a large
amount of ammunitions and a firearm in his house in the northern
suburb of Hobart, Tasmania, though he never had a gun license,
local press reported.
</P>
<P>
The massacre triggered a wide-spread call for the adoption of a
uniform, stricter gun law throughout the country. But some people
do not think this will solve the problem.
</P>
<P>
Jody Hodgett, who grew up with Bryant in the neighborhood, told
the Australian Associated Press (AAP) that he was a social outcast
in his teenage years and was unable to meet people.
</P>
<P>
"I feel sad for his family and feel sad on the whole that
something wasn't done before he did this to us," she said.
</P>
<P>
It is understood that Bryant's family told police that he was
schizophrenic.
</P>
<P>
Milton said that governments were becoming increasingly
impotent to limit the dissemination of images of violence through
media. He believes that there is a link between increasing
violence in media and mass murders.
</P>
<P>
There were suggestions that the Port Arthur massacre was
triggered by the slaughtering of 16 children and their teacher in
Dublane, Scotland last month.
</P>
<P>
Best-selling author John Grisham recently called for Hollywood
movie directors like Oliver Stone to be sued for inciting the
young to murder.
</P>
<P>
Claude Minisini, a former executive director of the
Melbourne-based Forensic Behavioral Investigate Services, said
that mass murderers were typically male, sullen, single and
hostile individuals who blamed others for their personal
misfortunes.
</P>
<P>
Some people in Australia have called for the resumption of
death penalty after the massacre.

<HEADLINE> Police Arrest 17 Drug Traffickers in Fujian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Police in Fujian Province rounded
up a gang of drug traffickers, including eight from Taiwan and nine
from the mainland in January, and seized a total of 172 kg of drugs
along with a pistol, ammunition and drug-making equipment.
</P>
<P>
Liu Yongzhen, mastermind of the gang, was one of those arrested
during the raid. He had established two "underground factories"
in the countryside near Longhai city.
</P>
<P>
At the end of last year Liu and his cronies plotted to smuggle
drugs to Taiwan, in collusion with the crew of a Taiwan fishing
boat.
</P>
<P>
When the ship entered Weitou Port, Jinjiang City, local police,
who had been alerted, pounced on it on the night of December 23.
</P>
<P>
Four Taiwan traffickers were arrested, and 68 kg of drugs
was found in the boat, as well as an Italian PB pistol and 250
bullets.
</P>
<P>
By mid-January the local police had captured the other drug
traffickers and destroyed the two factories.

<HEADLINE> Global Telecoms Talks Set to Miss Deadline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Two years of negotiations on a
global pact to liberalize basic telecommunications seem set to
miss the April 30 deadline after the United States bluntly
rejected offers from the European Union (EU) and Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. negotiators surprised all their trading partners
Monday by rejecting their market-opening offers as insufficient.
</P>
<P>
EU trade commissioner Leon Brittan deplored the move but
indicated that the real reason behind the hardening of the
U.S. stance is domestic pressure in a run-up to this autumn's
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
He described the failure to reach a deal within the deadline as
"a setback to the WTO and the multilateral trading system" it
represents.
</P>
<P>
Brittan told reporters that the two sides had agreed to extend
the deadline to February 15, 1997 to maintain the momentum built
up during the past two years of negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The new deadline is subject to approval by other WTO members
involved in the talks. Altogether there are 53 countries involved
in the negotiations. Brittan said he still hoped to stick to the
original implementation date of the deal, January 1, 1998.
</P>
<P>
"Disappointed as we are, we shall work with vigor and
determination in the remaining phase of the negotiations and we'll
seek to bring them into a successful conclusion," he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. negotiators hoped the extension of the deadline would
help some countries including Australia, Switzerland, Thailand and
Brazil come up with better offers, Brittan added.
</P>
<P>
He also said the extension of the deadline would also undermine
ongoing WTO negotiations on maritime transport due to be concluded
by June 1996.
</P>
<P>
Both the maritime and telecoms talks are parts of the
unfinished work left over from the seven-year Uruguay Round
multilateral trade talks concluded at the end of 1993.

<HEADLINE> HK Deposits Rise in March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's total deposits
increased 1.3 percent in March, following the 1.4 percent increase
in February, a spokesman of Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA)
said here today.
</P>
<P>
The increase was attributable to increases of 1.5 percent and
1.1 percent in HK dollar deposits and foreign currency deposits
respectively, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Within HK dollar deposits, demand deposits fell 2.1 percent,
but savings and time deposits grew by 1 and 2.2 percent
respectively, he said.
</P>
<P>
The rise in foreign currency deposits was mainly accounted for
a 1.9 percent in non-US foreign currency deposits during the
month. The US deposits grew by a modest 0.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that total outstanding loans and advances
receded by 1.6 percent in March, reversing the 2 percent growth in
February.
</P>
<P>
He said that the decline was the result of a 3.2 percent
decline in loans for use outside Hong Kong, which outweighed a 0.6
percent rise in loans for use in Hong Kong.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Regional Integration Fuels Asia's Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Over the past two decades the
Asia- Pacific region has become the most dynamic and rapidly
growing region in the world.
</P>
<P>
An important feature of this development has been the open
international trading system which countries of the region have
adopted.
</P>
<P>
In the context of globalization, trade between the Asia-Pacific
region and the rest of the world has increased dramatically.
</P>
<P>
This has fueled growth and stimulated the inflow of foreign
capital into the region.
</P>
<P>
Growing regional integration has been an important aspect of
this process as trade and capital movements within the
Asia-Pacific region have also increased.
</P>
<P>
Reinforcing this trend, countries have joined in formal
cooperative arrangements such as the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations and the South Asian Association for Regional
Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
They have also entered into subregional cooperative
arrangements such as "growing triangles" and "growth areas."
</P>
<P>
At a seminar held today at the Asian Development Bank on
"globalization and regional integration," Professor Wu Jinglian
of the Chinese Academy of Social Science said that regional
integration has played a very important role in East Asia's
sustained economic growth.
</P>
<P>
In the past several years, he said, the economic integration
process has been spreading further to China and Southeast Asian
countries.
</P>
<P>
However, he indicated that the distinguishing feature and merit
of Asia's regional integration lies in its non-exclusive
characteristics.
</P>
<P>
Countries in this region should exert themselves to foster this
"open regionalism" for their own interests, he added.

<HEADLINE> Improve Low-Yield Land to Raise Grain Output: Premier (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Economically-developed coastal areas, particularly provinces
like Jiangsu, where agriculture has a solid foundation for
development, should attach all the more importance to agricultural
production, increase agricultural output and strive particularly
to raise grain output in the course of developing a brisk healthy
economy, Li said.
</P>
<P>
After hearing a report by Zheng Silin, governor of Jiangsu
Province, on the integrated development of agriculture, the
premier said that a new way of comprehensively developing
agriculture has to be worked out. And a new investment management
mechanism for cultivating wasteland and beaches should be actively
explored.
</P>
<P>
Li said agriculture may achieve good economic results, as
indicated by the case of Jiangsu, through technical advancement,
proliferation of applicable technology, adoption of management of
scale on a moderate basis and in suitable places and development
of a diversified economy.
</P>
<P>
The premier said that the development of township firms must be
market-oriented and based on the specific conditions of various
localities to achieve a sounder growth.
</P>
<P>
On an inspection tour of the Jiangsu Weiwei Group and Xuzhou
Engineering Machinery Group, Li said state-owned firms should
utilize their advantages and develop their own products on the
basis of absorbing internationally-advanced technology. "Only in
this way can they prevail in the fierce market competition," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Visiting the Xuzhou Engineering Machinery Group, the premier
extended his congratulations to the workers there on the eve of
their holiday. May 1st is the international Labor Day.
</P>
<P>
During his tour of Xuzhou, Li also paid tribute to
monument to the heroes who fell in the historic Huaihai battle, a
major battle on the eve of the founding of new China.

<HEADLINE> Computer Railway Ticket Sales System Operational in Shenyang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, April 30 (Xinhua) -- A computer railway ticket sales
system was put into operation today at the North Railway Station
of this capital of Liaoning Province in northeast China.
</P>
<P>
Stationmaster Bao Xuesi said the station had spent four million
yuan to install 40 computer terminals in the ticket hall of the
station and the 15 ticket sales outlets scattered around the city.
</P>
<P>
Instead of designated windows for different trains, the
computer network allows passengers to buy an ticket at any window,
said Bao.
</P>
<P>
Computerization helps reduce mistakes and improve
efficiency. It allows better management of the ticketting and
makes tickets harder to forge.
</P>
<P>
The railway stations of Beijing, Shanghai and other Chinese
cities are also in the process of installing similar systems, with
the approval of the Ministry of Railways, whose aim is to set up a
nationwide computerized ticketting network before long.

<HEADLINE> Vice-Premier Urges Expansion of "Project Hope" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Li Lanqing, vice-premier of the
State Council, said that Party committees and governments at all
levels should support the operations of "Project Hope", to
help poverty-stricken areas develop local educational undertakings.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting with representatives of the project attending a
national work conference here today, Li called for the whole of
society to participate in the project, which is of far-reaching
influence for the country's educational development.
</P>
<P>
The project was launched a few years ago, aiming to help poor
children to attend school and dropouts to resume their schooling,
through raising public funds and building more schools for them.
</P>
<P>
It is a key point for the central government to strengthen the
nine-year compulsory education program in both urban and rural
areas in order to upgrade the overall qualifications of the
Chinese people, Li said.
</P>
<P>
But, because of limited financial capacity the central
government needs to rely on society in general to provide more
funds for education, Li added.
</P>
<P>
He also pointed out that the funds collected should be mainly
used fore the repair and reconstruction of dilapidated schools in
the poor areas.
</P>
<P>
On a separate occasion, Li met with 100 "outstanding
middle-school teachers" and praised them highly. He said the
teachers should help young people cultivate a correct outlook on
life and value, so that they can adapt to the rapidly-changing
world.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Repeats Opposition to NATO Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
today denounced NATO's planned eastward expansion as an attempt to
maintain Cold War mechanisms and proposed the setting up of a
security system to meet Europe's post-Cold War realities.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said, in an interview with the French "Politique
Internationale" magazine, that the preservation and expansion of
NATO is "an attempt to keep the foreign policy mechanisms and the
mentality of the Cold War times."
</P>
<P>
"The realities of the end of the 20th century demand new
approaches to the doctrine of security and, first and foremost, to
mount the preventive potential of security systems," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said the western military alliance, a product of the Cold
War, was out-dated and its enlargement to include central and
eastern European countries ran counter to its efforts to establish
a security system fit for the continent's new realities.
</P>
<P>
He said the premise of the Warsaw Pact bloc in early 1992 and
recent conflicts in Europe, such as those in the former
Yugoslavia, demanded a thorough reform of Europe's current
security mechanisms.
</P>
<P>
The existing security system in Europe had proved impotent in
dealing with such prolonged conflicts as those in the former
Yugoslavia and the powerful European Union should be equal to
setting up a preventive security system to avert such conflicts,
Yeltsin noted.
</P>
<P>
Russia and some other former Soviet republics have strongly
opposed NATO's eastward enlargement on the grounds that their
security would be threatened.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice-Premier Meets US Entrepreneurs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Premier Li Lanqing said here
today that China and the United States should do their best to
seek common views on the basis of mutual understanding so as to
expand bilateral trade and economic co-operation.
</P>
<P>
Li made the remark at a meeting with a senior delegation from
the US Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong led by its Chairman Mark
Michelson here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
He said that the US is the largest developed country in the
world while China is the largest developing country.
</P>
<P>
Their economies are mutually complementary. Further
strengthening their co-operation conforms to the fundamental
interests of the two nations and the two peoples, he added.
</P>
<P>
Facing the 21st century, Li said, the two countries should
combine their respective advantages and eliminate obstacles so as
to develop bilateral co-operation in economy, trade and technology.
</P>
<P>
The vice-premier said that the two countries differ in culture,
history and values so that differences in ideologies can not be
avoided.
</P>
<P>
"We should not mix ideological differences with the development
of bilateral economic relations and trade. If we do so, it will
bring no benefit to either side," Li said.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting Li expressed his appreciation for the
efforts that the US Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong has made to
promote Sino-US ties.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the two sides will strengthen
co-operation so as to give impetus to the growth of bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Li also briefed the visitors on the progress that China has
made in protecting intellectual property rights.

<P>
BEIJING, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong businesses are welcome
to participate more in the transformation of the mainland's
state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises, said Vice-Premier
Wu Bangguo here today.
</P>
<P>
He said he hoped that the advantages of Hong Kong in finance
and information would be better combined with the mainland's
technical talent and industrial basis so as to boost economic
co-operation and mutual development.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks when he met with a delegation of the
Business and Professionals Federation of Hong Kong, headed by its
President Vincent Lo Hong-sui.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting he introduced China's economic situation
and reform of its state-owned enterprises, saying that the actual
strength of the state-owned enterprises has been enhanced with
the deepening of the reform since the beginning of this year.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the problems and difficulties of the state-owned
enterprises, Wu stressed that the problems of the state-owned
enterprises are not a case of ownership, but of a mechanism left
over from history and connected with the macro-environment.
</P>
<P>
"If we stick to the correct guidelines, follow the current
road and summarize experience from practice, the reform of the
state-owned enterprises will be hopeful," he said.
</P>
<P>
Vincent Lo said that he was confident about the long-term
economic development of the mainland, adding that his federation
is willing to co-operate with mainland counterparts in the
management of modern enterprises and other fields.

<HEADLINE> Hezbollah, Amal Movement Clash in Southern Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Some members of the Hezbollah
(Party of God) organization and the Amal movement have clashed in
the southern Lebanese town of Qana where an Israeli shelling
killed 105 people on April 18.
</P>
<P>
Well-informed sources disclosed here today that the clash
between the two organizations occurred in Qana Monday. The Amal
movement is led by Nabih Berri, Speaker of Lebanon's House of
Representatives.
</P>
<P>
In view of the decision by the Lebanese government to hold a
national funeral ceremony in Sour today, the Hezbollah members
Monday hung banners of their organization along the road leading
to the cemetery where the massacre victims were to be buried.
</P>
<P>
This move was objected to the Amal movement, which demanded
that the Hezbollah banners be removed and replaced by the national
flag of Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
A quarrel between supporters of the two sides developed into
a fist fight, which gave rise to a great deal of tension in the
town of Qana.
</P>
<P>
The source pointed out that Hezbollah has maintained that there
is an attempt to encircle it following the conclusion of the
"April Understanding," and that Nabih Berri and the Amal movement
leaders have formed an alliance intended to enhance the State
influence in the south and to limit Hezbollah's control of the
situation there.
</P>
<P>
No reports of casualties resulted from the clash are available
for the time being, however.
</P>
<P>
Political observers say that the current truce between
Hezbollah and the Amal movement will be temporary and that
contradiction between the two sides will take place later in
several places.

<HEADLINE> Improve Low-Yield Land to Raise Grain Output: Premier (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 30 (Xinhua) -- China pins high hopes on the
transformation of medium- and low-yield farmland as a major means
of raising grain output, Premier Li Peng said.
</P>
<P>
He said arable land must be strictly protected from being
diverted to other purposes. And in places where conditions permit,
waste land and beaches should also be cultivated to beef up
agricultural production.
</P>
<P>
The premier made the remarks during a visit to Xuzhou City, in
east China's Jiangsu Province, April 28-29, during which he
inspected rural areas, township enterprises and state-owned firms.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture is the basis of China's national economy, and its
sustainable growth is of particular significance to economic
development, Li said, stressing that efforts must be made to
meet the rising demand of economic development and the growing
population for grain.
</P>
<P>
Braving mud and drizzle, the premier visited Damiao Township
near Xuzhou, a showcase of transforming unproductive farmland into
high-yield soil, and made an on-the-spot inspection of the local
wheat fields.
</P>
<P>
The issue of feeding the people is of paramount importance to
China, with a population of over 1.2 billion, Li Peng said,
calling for unremitting efforts to hit the target of increasing
the grain yield by 50 million tons during the 1996-2000 period.
</P>
<P>
He said that there is still much room for increasing grain
output on the Huanghe-Huaihe-Haihe Plain in east China, one of the
country's major agricultural zones, where much medium- and
low-yield farmland is yet to be cultivated as potential fertile
areas.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ministry of Agriculture, two-thirds of China's
farmland is not very productive, and China has many uncultivated
mountainous areas, as well as bodies of water and beaches that can
be tapped for foodstuff production.
</P>
<P>
With only a month to go before the summer harvest, the premier
reminded local governments to make good pre-harvest preparations.

<HEADLINE> Chechen Rebels Deny Yandarbiyev Killed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Chechen separatists today denied
that their new president Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev had been killed,
while pro-Moscow Chechen officials claimed the rebel leader had
quit the political arena, whether alive or dead.
</P>
<P>
One of Yandarbiyev's aides, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, told the Itar-Tass news agency that reports about his
death were "absolutely groundless."
</P>
<P>
He said Yandarbiyev was "alive and working in a normal regime,"
although it was not clear whether the aide had personally seen the
leader, who took charge of the Chechen separatist rebels after
their leader Dhokar Dudayev was killed in a Russian air attack on
April 21.
</P>
<P>
The aide also denied reports of clashes between warring
factions within the Chechen guerrilla movement, during which
Yandarbiyev was reportedly killed.
</P>
<P>
Itar-Tass reported on Monday that Yandarbiyev was killed in a
skirmish between Chechen rebels on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
Dead or alive, Yandarbiyev has quit the political arena,
according to Moscow-backed Chechen government spokesman Ruslan
Martagov, who initially broke the news about Yandarbiyev's death
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
However, he still believes Yandarbiyev has been killed because
he has not appeared in public since reports about his death
surfaced.
</P>
<P>
"The withdrawal of Yandarbiyev from the political arena,
following Dzhokhar Dudayev, can be considered as a fact," Martagov
told Itar-Tass, adding that his death was not a necessary
condition for that to happen.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here on Monday night said Shamil Basayev, who
led a terrorist raid on Budennovsk in southern Russian last
summer, has taken over as commander-in-chief of the Chechen rebel
forces.

ULAN BATOR, April 30 (Xinhua) -- France and Britain have both
pledged to continue their support for Mongolia's foreign policy
and its political and economic reforms, Mongolian President
Punsalmaagiyn Ochirbat said here Monday.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Workers Urged to Strive for New Five-Year Plan (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 30 (Xinhua) -- The "People's Daily" calls on all
working people to do their utmost for the implementation of the
Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000) and the long-range objective for
the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
In an editorial to mark International Labor Day to be published
tomorrow, the country's leading newspaper describes the plan for
national economic and social development and the objective as a
"grand program" for guiding the Chinese people of various ethnic
groups into the 21st century along the road of building socialism
with Chinese characteristics.
</P>
<P>
It notes that to attain the objective it is imperative to
achieve two fundamental shifts, namely, a shift in the economic
structure from a planned one to a socialist market one, and a
shift in the economic growth model from extensive operation to
intensive operation.
</P>
<P>
The shifts are "essential" to the sustained, rapid and sound
growth of China's economy, it adds.
</P>
<P>
As the representative of the advanced productive forces, the
working class "shoulders a great mission in realizing the two
fundamental shifts," it says.
</P>
<P>
The editorial emphasizes the importance of attaching the utmost
importance to and giving full scope to the role of the working
class in stepping up the restructuring of state-owned enterprises
and achieving the two shifts.
</P>
<P>
It says that if the status of the working class as masters of
the country were neglected, and if the sense of responsibility,
initiative and creativeness of workers were neglected, it would be
totally impossible to achieve China's grand cross-century program.
</P>
<P>
It adds that it is imperative to further understand the status
and role of the working class in the country and enterprises from
the viewpoint of consolidating and strengthening the role of the
Chinese Communist Party as the ruling party and building socialism
with Chinese characteristics.

<HEADLINE> Widening Income Disparity, Major Challenge to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Widening income disparity is
posing a major challenge to Singapore's social cohesion, Prime
Minister Goh Chok Tong said here today in his May Day Message.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Singapore has already become a "more advanced
developing economy," the prime minister said, "one major challenge
to our social cohesion will be widening income disparity."
</P>
<P>
But he was quick to add that overall, income distribution in
the country has been getting more, not less, equal. Incomes of
Singaporeans would continue to rise across the board as the
economy grows, he observed.
</P>
<P>
Goh also said that he expected incomes of very successful
Singaporeans, those with top professional skills, managerial
ability, business acumen and drive, to rise much more.
</P>
<P>
This group, he said, represented five percent to ten percent of
the population and are in short supply not just in Singapore but
throughout the booming region.
</P>
<P>
He said that the government's policies on universal education,
home ownership and asset enhancement are the most vital ways to
give every citizen the best chances in life and a substantial
stake in the country.
</P>
<P>
He noted that not all Singaporeans can become entrepreneurs or
professionals. But given the proper training and education, nearly
all citizens can become skilled technicians or workers.

<HEADLINE> China to Lower Bank Interest Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 30 (Xinhua) -- China will lower its bank savings
and loan interest rates starting tomorrow, the People's Bank of
China, the country's central bank, announced today.
</P>
<P>
The interest rates for deposits and loans between the central
bank and other financial organizations will also be adjusted, the
announcement added.
</P>
<P>
The adjustment, made with the approval of the State Council, is
the first of its kind since July 11, 1993, though the inter-bank
rate was adjusted twice in the period.
</P>
<P>
The announcement said that China's successful macro-economic
adjustment has brought once-rampant inflation under control and
produced a remarkable fall in the level of prices, and that the
actual interest rate has turned from negative to positive.
</P>
<P>
To reduce the burden of interest upon enterprises and promote
the sustained, rapid and healthy development of the national
economy, the bank said, the interest rate on savings deposits will
be lowered by 0.98 percentage points, and the interest rate for
loans by 0.75 percentage points, starting tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the special interest rates for savings
deposits held by overseas Chinese will be canceled. The rate will
be the same as that for Chinese citizens, according to the
announcement.
</P>
<P>
The annual interest rate for savings deposits by citizens and
institutions after the adjustment will be 2.97 percent for current
deposits, 4.8 percent for three-month fixed deposits, 7.2 percent
for half-year deposits, 9.18 percent for one-year deposits, 9.9
percent for two-year deposits, 10.8 percent for three-year
deposits and 12.06 percent for five-year deposits.
</P>
<P>
The adjusted annual interest rate for loans by banks will be
9.72 percent for six-month loans and 10.98 percent for one-year
loans, both for circulating capital. As far as fixed assets are
concerned, the annual interest rate will be 11.52 percent for
one-year (including less than one-year) loans, 13.14 percent for
loans ranging from one year to three years, 14.94 percent for
three-to-five-year loans and 15.12 percent for loans longer than
five years.
</P>
<P>
A spokesmen for the bank said that interest rate adjustment
will have a positive effect on the Chinese economy, as it will
reduce the burdens on enterprises, especially those on large and
medium-sized state-owned enterprises, while protecting the
interests of depositors.
</P>
<P>
However, the spokesman also pointed out that the adjustment is
mainly a result of the reduced inflation level. Therefore, it can
not be regarded as a sign that the central bank has relaxed its
control over the money supply. The central bank's relatively tight
monetary policy has not changed, he said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Workers Urged to Strive for New Five-Year Plan (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The editorial notes that it is of historic importance to
realize the two shifts, to further promote productivity and to
upgrade China's comprehensive strength.
</P>
<P>
However, the editorial says, in the course of realizing the two
shifts, due to various reasons the interests of some people,
including some working people, will be somewhat affected and some
difficulties will appear in their lives.
</P>
<P>
This is what the Party is trying to avoid, but cannot totally
avoid, the editorial states, adding that this needs the
understanding and support of the workers and the masses.
</P>
<P>
It asks all Party officials and trade unions to work hard to
relieve the workers' difficulties, help solve their problems and
guide them to work in tandem with the Party's basic lines and
policies in an effort to step up the reforms and opening to the
outside world.
</P>
<P>
Describing the working class as the key force in advancing
social progress and the main force in the reform and modernization
drive, the editorial stresses the importance of implementing the
policy of relying on the working people and guaranteeing their
leading status in the socialist cause.
</P>
<P>
The editorial explains that the workers should also make
efforts to improve their qualities and arm themselves
ideologically with Deng Xiaoping's theories on building socialism
with Chinese characteristics.
</P>
<P>
It urges the working class to learn and master new technology,
improve their working efficiency and promote productivity.
</P>
<P>
The editorial says that some model workers have been selected,
and all workers should learn from them.
</P>
<P>
It calls on all the working people to unite around the Party
Central Committee with Jiang Zemin at the core and make greater
contributions to the new Five-Year Plan.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Lu Ping, director of the Hong
Kong and Macao Affairs Office of China's State Council, met with a
delegation from the Business and Professionals Federation of Hong
Kong headed by its President Vincent Lo Hong-sui here today.
</P>
<P>
Lu told the visitors that the Provisional Legislative Council
of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) is a
necessary mechanism with which to deal with the "legal vacuum", as
the resumption of China's sovereignty over Hong Kong looms, since
the British side has sabotaged the "through-train" arrangement.
</P>
<P>
The Provisional Legislative Council will not infringe upon the
powers of the existing Legislative Council of the British Hong
Kong government, nor will it become another power center, he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
With the task of passing laws that are necessary for the
effective operation of the future SAR, the Provisional Legislative
Council will end its tenure when the first Legislative Council is
elected, he pledged.
</P>
<P>
Lu noted that the Hong Kong compatriots expect improved
transparency and the opportunity of becoming acquainted with the
Preparatory Committee's work. He proposed that Radio Television
Hong Kong gives air time for the committee's work.
</P>
<P>
"In this way, the Hong Kong people will be able to get a prompt
and overall understanding of the Preparatory Committee's work,
while some cloudy issues will be clarified," he said. He added
that the Hong Kong people will welcome such a step.
</P>
<P>
Issues of permanent Hong Kong residents, people with foreign
nationality's right of abode, the civil servants and other
relevant matters were also discussed between Lu and the visitors
at the meeting.

<HEADLINE> ADB Expects Shared Responsibility from Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 30 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank (ADB)
is expecting from Asia shared responsibility for the solving
urgent global task such as poverty reduction.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening session of the 29th annual ADB meeting,
Klaus-Jurgen Hedrich, chairman of the ADB Board of Governors and
governor for Germany, said today that most of the poorest people
in the world, namely some 750 million out of a total of one
billion, are still to be found in Asia.
</P>
<P>
This means that the tasks facing "traditional" development aid
in this region are still immense, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that achieving greater equality of wealth within some
countries and also between different countries and regions is a
problem that the affected countries and their neighbors need to
tackle themselves, jointly.
</P>
<P>
This will bring a new dimension to economic cooperation between
traditional donor countries and the newly industrialized countries
as donors in the field of poverty alleviation in Asia, he said.
</P>
<P>
Hedrich, who is also parliamentary state secretary of Germany,
said that there is perhaps a need to emphasize the dual role of
new donors.
</P>
<P>
On the one hand, he said, they can help with advice on matters
of development policy, even allowing for the fact that every
country has found its own way of development which is best suited
to its individual needs.
</P>
<P>
He added that on the other hand, the integration of new donors
in the global responsibility naturally means significant
appropriate financial contributions as part of international
burden sharing.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, ADB President Mitsuo Sato said, "The war on poverty
requires additional resources. Our capacity to assist the poorer
developing member countries will need to be reinforced."

</P>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, April 30 (Xinhua) -- The annual growth rate of
the industrial sector in Tanzania increased from one per cent in
1994 to about five per cent in 1995.

<HEADLINE> China to Expand International Co-operation in Telecom Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 30 (Xinhua) -- China's telephone industry is to
step up co-operation with other countries in technical and capital
fields this year, in a bid to greatly improve the country's
telecommunications infrastructure and technical benchmark.
</P>
<P>
The co-operation will concentrate on three aspects, including
upgrading the efficiency of the national public telecom network,
sorting out and introducing the latest technologies from abroad,
and strengthening co-ordination with international telecom
organizations and regional technical standards bodies, according
to People's Posts and Telecommunications Daily.
</P>
<P>
In the technical development plan of the industry this year,
high technologies such as ATM, SDH and ISDN will be given priority.
</P>
<P>
The industry will also try to attract more foreign investment,
but the public telecom services are still inaccessible to foreign
investors.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the low-interest foreign loans, China will
introduce a payment by installment scheme to the industry to
expand the application of foreign equipment.
</P>
<P>
The paper added that foreign companies will be permitted to
invest in China's telecom projects through co-operation with
domestic enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The industry had absorbed overseas investment of more than six
billion US dollars by 1995.
</P>
<P>
The industry has so far launched co-operative projects with 61
countries and regions, according to the paper.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Asian Economies Face Major Challenges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 30 (Xinhua) -- In the past 20 years and more,
Asia has experienced a rapid economic growth with an annual rate
of some eight percent.
</P>
<P>
It was once thought that the economic fortunes of developing
countries were closely linked to those of industrialized nations.
</P>
<P>
Last year, despite the Mexican financial crisis and the Barings
fiasco, Asia's average economic growth stood at 7.9 percent as
against 2.6 percent for the global economy.
</P>
<P>
This resilience is attributed to several factors: the openness
of their economies and flexibility of their domestic markets,
especially labor markets.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, competitiveness and increasing economic integration
in the world economy have created an expanding set of economic
opportunities for the region.
</P>
<P>
However, at the opening session of the 29th annual meeting of
the Asian Development Bank (ADB) held today, ADB President Mitsuo
Sato said that the future of the region faces four major
challenges.
</P>
<P>
The first and foremost challenge is poverty reduction. He
said, "We must never forget that Asia remains home to the majority
of the world's poor people. In many Asian countries, poverty
indicators are worse than in sub-Saharan Africa."
</P>
<P>
In trying to close the gap between the "two Asias," important
lessons can be learned from the experience of the more prosperous
economies of the region, he added.
</P>
<P>
The second challenge is the transitional economies in Asia. In
most of these countries, gradualism has been the preferred
approach, helping avoid the economic and social upheavals often
associated with the "big bang" strategy.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that further efforts will be needed on several
fronts to facilitate their transition to market economies.
</P>
<P>
The third major challenge is raising productivity in Asia,
particularly in the middle-income countries.
</P>
<P>
To accomplish this, he noted that mobilizing adequate resources
has to be joined to a more efficient use of resources.
</P>
<P>
The fourth challenge is subregional economic cooperation.
While the Asian and Pacific region is characterized by diversity,
there is also much commonality within the subregion.
</P>
<P>
He said, "cooperation at this level enables us to exploit a
great deal of complementarities and economies of scale, thus
accelerating the growth momentum.

<HEADLINE> Fruitful Results Scored for 863 Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 30 (Xinhua) -- China's high-profile Hi-tech
Research and Development Program, popularly known as the 863
Program, is expected to make major new technical breakthroughs in
the coming years, a senior minister said in Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
The program -- employing 30,000 Chinese scientists -- has
already achieved fruitful results since its implementation a
decade ago, said Song Jian, State Councillor and Minister of State
Science and Technology Commission today.
</P>
<P>
Song made the remarks at a press conference in the capital to
highlight the first ten years of the Hi-tech R&AMP;D program (863
Program) of China.
</P>
<P>
And he made it clear that the program would continue into the
future with no time limit.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Lilan, executive vice-minister of State Science and
Technology Commission and some leading scientists from the program
gave detailed accounts on the progress of the program.
</P>
<P>
China's 863 Program was formally approved by the State Council
in March 1986. It identified at the very beginning 15 subjects in
seven key areas as the hi-tech R&AMP;D priorities, namely
biotechnology, space technology, information technology, laser
technology, automation technology, energy technology and new
material.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,200 research findings have been scored in ten
years, 560 of them have reached the world advanced levels; it also
made major breakthroughs in a group of key technologies,
shortening the technological distance from the world advanced
level in those areas.
</P>
<P>
According to an evaluation survey on 36 key technologies of the
program, 60 percent of them rose towards, or neared world advanced
levels; and 11 percent of them reached or maintained world
advanced levels.
</P>
<P>
The program has promoted the commercialization and
industrialization of research results, and has made contributions
to the technological renovations of the traditional industries,
and to the fostering of new industries.
</P>
<P>
Ten percent of laboratory research results have been put
into production and 38 percent of the research results have been
applied into practice, bringing in remarkable economic and social
benefits.
</P>
<P>
More than 30,000 scientists have participated in the program,
from which has emerged a new generation of hi-tech research talents,
and the program has also built seven research and development
centers and 17 laboratories.
</P>
<P>
"During the Ninth Five-Year Plan(1996-2000), the program will
make breakthroughs in eight or ten fundamental technologies which
are closely related to the national economy and have bright
prospects for industrial applications, contributing to solving the
urgent problems in the growth of national economy and to the
accomplishment of the country's second strategic goal," said Zhu
Lilan at the conference.
</P>
<P>
"There is no termination in the development of the 863
Program, we will bring forth new ideas and further open up new
fields to achieve the specific goal of industrialization as soon
as possible," she noted.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Asian Economies Face Major Challenges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 30 (Xinhua) -- In the past 20 years and more,
Asia has experienced a rapid economic growth with an annual rate
of some eight percent.
</P>
<P>
It was once thought that the economic fortunes of developing
countries were closely linked to those of industrialized nations.
</P>
<P>
However, experts said that Asia's dynamic economies now appear
to be more able to weather the changing tidies of economic
performance in the industrialized countries.
</P>
<P>
Last year, despite the Mexican financial crisis and the Barings
fiasco, Asia's average economic growth stood at 7.9 percent as
against 2.6 percent for the global economy.
</P>
<P>
This resilience is attributed to several factors: the openness
of their economies and flexibility of their domestic markets,
especially labor markets.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, competitiveness and increasing economic integration
in the world economy have created an expanding set of economic
opportunities for the region.
</P>
<P>
However, at the opening session of the 29th annual meeting of
the Asian Development Bank (ADB) held today, ADB President Mitsuo
Sato said that the future of region faces four major challenges.
</P>
<P>
The first and foremost challenge is poverty reduction. He
said, "We must never forget that Asia remains home to the majority
of the world's poor people. In many Asian countries, poverty
indicators are worse than in sub-Saharan Africa."
</P>
<P>
In trying to close the gap between the "two Asias," important
lessons can be learned from the experience of the more prosperous
economies of the region, he added.
</P>
<P>
The second challenge is the transitional economies in Asia. In
most of these countries, gradualism has been the preferred
approach, helping avoid the economic and social upheavals often
associated with the "big bang" strategy.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that further efforts will be needed on several
fronts to facilitate their transition to market economies.
</P>
<P>
The third major challenge is raising productivity in Asia,
particularly in the middle-income countries.
</P>
<P>
To accomplish this, he noted that mobilizing adequate resources
has to be joined to a more efficient use of resources.
</P>
<P>
The fourth challenge is subregional economic cooperation.
While the Asian and Pacific region is characterized by diversity,
there is also much commonality within the subregion.
</P>
<P>
He said, "cooperation at this level enables us to exploit a
great deal of complementarities and economies of scale, thus
accelerating the growth momentum.

<HEADLINE> More Multinational Firms Locate in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 30 (Xinhua) -- At least 15 regional headquarters
(RHQS) of multinational corporations were approved by the
Philippine government in the first four months of 1996.
</P>
<P>
Eloisa Lim, director of the Board of Investments (BOI), said
today that Manila is expecting to attract some 70 RHQS this year,
which will surpass the 43 approved RHQS last year.
</P>
<P>
Already, the BOI has approved the pending three applications
for RHQS that will oversee the operations of its branches and
affiliates in the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
They are World Enterprise (Far East) Ltd. of Hongkong,
Yamanouhi Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. and Kia Intertrade of America
Inc.
</P>
<P>
Multinational firms establishing their RHQS here are required
to fund their operations from their principal with a minimum of
15,000 US dollars to 50,000 dollars.
</P>
<P>
However, most of the RHQS investments exceed the required
amount, even reaching 300,000 dollars.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government has created a legislative-executive
Development Advisory Council task force primarily to promote a
hospitable environment for multinational firms locating their RHQS
in the country.

<HEADLINE> China to Strike Overall Balance Between Energy Supply. Demand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 30 (Xinhua) -- China will maintain an overall
balance between energy supply and demand this year in its national
economic growth. But there will be isolated energy shortages in
some regions, according to source of the State Planning Commission
(SPC).
</P>
<P>
The SPC officials said in Beijing today that energy production
this year is expected to be up 2 percent over the 1995 figure.
</P>
<P>
The output of mined coal this year is forecast at 1.29 billion
tons, equivalent to the amount of last year. Electricity output is
expected to stand at 1.07 trillion kwh, up 7 percent, or 70
billion kwh, as compared with that of last year.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the country will produce 150 million tons of crude oil
and 19.6 billion cu m of natural gas this year.
</P>
<P>
This shows that there exists only slight energy shortage this
year, which can be eased through redistribution, according to the
officials.
</P>
<P>
They said that owing to the state's encouraging policy, new
progress is expected this year in the development of new energy
resources in the rural areas.
</P>
<P>
The country will develop nearly 1.47 billion cu m of methane
gas, a generating capacity of over 17 million kw by small
hydro-electric power stations and a wind-power generating capacity
of over 63,000 kw.
</P>
<P>
The SPC officials noted that the country will strive hard this
year to save energy and reduce consumption, alongside efforts to
enhance economic efficiency, in a bid to strike a balance between
energy supply and demand nationwide.
</P>
<P>
According to the officials, the coal sector will rely on
technological progress to develop high-yield and highly-efficient
coal mines and develop intensive coal production, in addition to
the efforts to readjust coal product mix and enhance competition
capability by cutting production costs in the large and
medium-sized coal mines.
</P>
<P>
While in power construction, the country will concentrate funds
on the construction of backbone power stations and power grids
which can be completed within the year or in the near future.
Meanwhile, efforts should be made to regulate power supply and
consumption at peak time and take full advantage of the installed
generating capacity.
</P>
<P>
As for petroleum development, steps will be taken to raise oil
recovery rate in the aging oilfields in the eastern part of the
country and speed up oil exploration and production in the
offshore oilfields as well as the oilfields in the western part of
the country.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Port City Trades Property Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Port city of Xiamen in east
China's Fujian Province has started trading property rights for
the first 36 Chinese and foreign enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Twenty state-owned concerns, 11 private entities, and five
foreign-funded firms, engaged in real estate, machinery and
electronics, chemical, transportation, and freezing aquatic
products are participating in the trading.
</P>
<P>
The trading of property rights creates conditions for mergers
and acquisition of enterprises in different regions. Since the
inauguration of the center for trading property rights at the end
of 1995, its transactions have reached nearly 50 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Trading property rights is one of the ways China has tried to
streamline state enterprises, and make better use of property in
those enterprises.

<HEADLINE> Special Secretaries Required for Shanghai's Companies Listed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai has led other Chinese
cities in requiring companies issuing B shares targeted at foreign
investors to employ special secretaries for their boards of
directors.
</P>
<P>
"Hiring special secretaries is in line with international
practice," said Zhang Ning, an official with the Shanghai
Securities Administration Office. "It helps standardize the B
share market and meets overseas investors' demands."
</P>
<P>
He noted that the establishment of the secretary system will
enable companies issuing B shares to release information in a
standardized way, build an effective mechanism to regulate
directors and the boards of directors, and protect the investors'
interests.
</P>
<P>
The secretaries will be in charge of releasing information,
preparing meetings of directors and general conferences of
share-holders, helping the boards of directors act in line with
laws and company regulations, and keep day-to-day contacts with
share-holders, according to a regulation which Shanghai
promulgated in March.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai Securities Administration Office and the Shanghai
Stock Exchange are expected to hold the first training course for
the secretaries for the boards of directors in 38 companies
issuing B shares on the local bourse.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that companies issuing A shares, strictly for
domestic investors, will also have special secretaries for their
boards of directors.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 30 (Xinhua) -- A war of words broke out over
family trifles between father and son in north Shanghai's Yangpu
District. It quickly escalated to an exchange of fists.
</P>
<P>
But the fight did not last long thanks to the intervention of
Wang Lihua, a middle-aged woman who rushed to the spot when she
was told about the altercation.
</P>
<P>
Troubleshooter Wang, 56, is the director of mediation on the
residents committee of her neighborhood, a job she was given after
her retirement from a food manufacturing factory.
</P>
<P>
"Mediation can help improve relations between the residents and
maintain peace and harmony in families," said Wang, who in the
past six years has mediated in some 350 disputes.
</P>
<P>
There are over 100,000 neighborhood mediators like Wang in
Shanghai, which has a population of 13 million. In the past three
years, they have found solutions for some 170,000 civil disputes,
and prevented around 1,300 suicides and major crimes, such as
murder, from happening.
</P>
<P>
The team of mediators includes staff members of legal
authorities, members of residents' committees, as well as
volunteers among common citizens, with organizations at levels of
districts, streets, and neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
Local legal authorities regularly give them lectures on law and
allow them to attend court trials to hear criminal trials to
enhance their mediation skills.
</P>
<P>
"Mediation organizations in Shanghai have helped solve a large
number of civil disputes in their early stage, thus making great
contributions to the maintenance of social order," a local court
official said, citing a case in which a mediator stopped a divorce
by persuading the husband to quit gambling.

<HEADLINE> Southern Somali Port Of Merca Closed In Clash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, April 30 (Xinhua) -- At least two people were
killed and nine others wounded yesterday evening in armed clashes
in the southern Somali port of Merca.
</P>
<P>
The fighting erupted among militiamen of General Mohamed Farah
Aidid inside the seaport of Merca, 100 km south of Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
According to eyewitnesses from Merca, small and heavy machine
guns were used during the armed confrontation, which has forced
the port operations to cease with all embarked vessels going off
the seashore for safety preacutions.
</P>
<P>
The wounded, mainly businessmen, were rushed to the private
hospitals in South Mogadishu after the main hospital of Merca was
closed down.
</P>
<P>
The armed confrontation in Merca occurred following the
nomination of a new administrator for the port by General Aidid.
</P>
<P>
The shooting began when angry gunmen stormed into the seaport
to protest against the new administration, eyewitnesses said.
</P>
<P>
The government of General Aidid, who controls most of South
Mogadishu, remains silent about the incident.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Merca was turned a battle field between militiamen
of General Aidid and those of his former financier, Mr Ssman
Hassan Ali Atto.
</P>
<P>
The closure of Merca port will severely affect the already
sharpening food prices in Mogadishu's main markets, where foreign
exchange rates are soaring against Somali Shillings amid
political uncertainties.

<HEADLINE> China to Enforce Job Permit System for Foreign Workers  (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 30 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government is ready
to implement a strict job permit system tomorrow (May 1) for
foreigners intending to work in China, and those already in China
will have to apply for job licences within two months.
</P>
<P>
"The Regulations on Management Of Foreign Workers in China,"
jointly issued by the Labor Ministry, Public Security Ministry,
Foreign Ministry and Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation, take effect on May 1.
</P>
<P>
"From then foreign workers that China is short of will continue
to be received warmly, and `ordinary workers' will be rigorously
controlled from entering the labor market," said Wang Cheng, an
official with the Employment Department of the Labor Ministry, in
an interview with Xinhua today.
</P>
<P>
"This measure, a certain outcome of rule of law over China's
increasingly mature labor market, is to protect its domestic labor
market and safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of
foreign workers and Chinese employers," he said.
</P>
<P>
New China started to employ foreign people when it was founded
in 1949, and especially the large number of foreign workers with
specialized expertise have "played active roles in promoting
China's economic progress, its process of opening up to the
outside world and the modernization drive," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, foreign workers have been found to be doing minor jobs
that many Chinese are also capable of, and "such phenomena is
quite serious in some places," he said
</P>
<P>
Since the unemployment problem in China is already tough with a
large population of 1.2 billion, allowing ordinary foreign workers
to vie for precious job opportunities is not appropriate for
China's domestic situation, Wang explained.
</P>
<P>
"Moreover, the new system has been in accordance with
international practice, which has nothing to find fault with," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The Public Security Ministry also said that it has found many
foreign laborers engaged in the illegal trades of prostitution,
smuggling and drug-trafficking in China, and "causing adverse
effects on social order," and in need of effective management and
control.

<HEADLINE> China's Workers' Games Opens in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 30 (Xinhua) -- China's Third Workers' Games, the
second in more than a decade, opened here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
State Councilor Li Tieying officially declared the games open
in Tian'anmen Square.
</P>
<P>
Li, also a member of the Political Bureau of the Chinese
Communist Party Central Committee, lit a tripod-shaped cauldron
with the torch set afire earlier by a welding torch in suburban
Beijing's Changxindian Rolling Stock Plant.
</P>
<P>
Before the founding of New China in 1949, over 30,000 workers
on the Beijing-Hankou Railway, including those in the plant, went
on strike in 1923 under the leadership of the Chinese Communist
Party.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, thousands of colored balloons and pigeons were
flied over the Tian'anmen Square to celebrate the second such
games since 1985.
</P>
<P>
Fifty-five torches were then lit to coincide with the number
the delegations participating in the games.
</P>
<P>
About 8,000 athletes will compete in 11 events in 17 cities
across the country from April to September this year.
</P>
<P>
The inaugural Workers' Games were held in October, 1955, and
the second in September, 1985, both in Beijing.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Textile Industry Cuts Redundant Workforce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 30 (Xinhua) -- The textile industry in China's
leading industrial city of Shanghai has laid off 170,000 people on
half pay in the past five years as part of a pruning program.
</P>
<P>
But 90,000 of them have found new jobs.
</P>
<P>
Local textile industries used to employ a record workforce of
550,000 and generated a gross output value of 654.5 billion
yuan (about 80 billion US dollars) between 1949, when the New
China was founded, and 1995.
</P>
<P>
The rising costs of both raw materials and labor compelled the
textile sector to adjust the product mix with the establishment of
a market economy system in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
Workers who have been laid off still can get half of their
original salary to help cover their daily expenses.
</P>
<P>
An official with the local government said that departments
concerned have taken all means possible to solve the problem,
including providing training programs and encouraging laid-off
workers to find their own new jobs.
</P>
<P>
After the readjustments the textile industry has made net
profits worth several hundred million yuan, overturning the loss
making years in the past.
</P>
<P>
According to a long-term development plan, Shanghai will move
two thirds of its textile mills in the downtown areas to the
suburban areas and other parts of the country in the coming five
years.
</P>
<P>
And by the end of the century, the textile industry is expected
to cut down its workforce to only 250,000 people, 120,000 less
than present.
</P>
<P>
However, the annual output value is expected to hit some 20
billion yuan by then, the official said.

<HEADLINE> China to Enforce Job Permit System for Foreign Workers  (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
According to the regulations, foreign people intending to work
in China must obtain a permit approved by the Chinese government
and apply for professional visa from Chinese embassies, and later
a job licence from local labor departments and a residential
licence from public security departments.
</P>
<P>
Those already working in overseas-funded enterprises in China
have to visit labor departments to apply for job licences with
their residential licence by June 30.
</P>
<P>
The regulations are not applicable to those with diplomatic
immunity. And those employed by the government, working on the
seas, on acting tours may not need job permits and licences.
</P>
<P>
Foreigners employed by Sino-overseas joint projects and
representatives of foreign businesses in China do not need job
licences.
</P>
<P>
The regulations strictly ban foreign students and spouses of
foreign diplomatic personnel from taking jobs in China without
relevant procedures.
</P>
<P>
According to provisional official statistics, there are about
180,000 foreigners working in China, 70,000 of them employed by
government bodies, and 100,000 working for foreign institutions or
overseas-funded ventures.

The second family health project will cost over 40 million
U.S. Dollars. The funds have been sourced from the World Bank,

DAR ES SALAAM, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian Vice-president
Omar Ali Juma urged for religious tolerance in the
country on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after Idd-el-Haj prayers in Dar es Salaam on Sunday
morning, Dr. Omar condemned the war of words between religious
denominations, saying this was dangerous as it could divide the
nation along religious lines.

Although freedom of worship was guaranteed in the country, the
government would not tolerate any person or group proved to
engage in religious instigation, he warned.

The vice-president blasted the so called Islamic
fundamentalists and urged religious leaders to control them.

He said muslims today were living in the very same world which
the founder of the religion, prophet Muhamad lived in. "He
(prophet), lived with people of different religions, but never
inflamed them," he said.

<P>
Earlier, the Tanzania Muslim Council (Bakwata) Executive
Secretary#,Alhaj Mahame Rajab Kundya, emphasized peace and unity

<HEADLINE> Developing Sino-African Ties Is China's Consistent Policy: Qian (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 30 (Xinhua) -- The forthcoming visit by Chinese
President Jiang Zemin to Africa demonstrates that the
maintenance of friendly relations with Africa from generation to
generation is a consistent policy of the Chinese government and a
long-lasting wish of the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen made this
remark when he held talks with visiting Foreign Minister Stan
Mudenge of Zimbabwe in Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
Qian assured that the policy will not change because of any
changes of time, situation or government.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of Jiang's visit is to "increase friendship,
strengthen unity, promote cooperation and learn from the African
people," he said.
</P>
<P>
"At this important moment towards the turn of the century,
the visit will help friendly relations between China and
African nations to become even closer, strengthen China-Africa
cooperation in international affairs, as well as establish the
long-term, stable and 21st-century-oriented brotherly ties with
Africa," Qian said.
</P>
<P>
Mudenge said his country welcomes President Jiang's visit,
which will also include Kenya, Ethiopia, Egypt, Mali and Namibia.
</P>
<P>
He commented that profounded changes have taken place in the
situation in Africa after the Cold War, and that a trend of
ignoring Africa has occurred in the international community.
</P>
<P>
Under those circumstances, he said, Jiang's visit will be "of
extreme importance."
</P>
<P>
The visit will help consolidate and develop Africa-China and
Zimbabwe-China relations, Mudenge said.

two countries have been closely co-operating in political and
economic fields for a long time, with a constant exchange of top
level visits.
</P>

relations with Zimbabwe, and treasures the friendship between
people of the two countries.

maintaining national unity and political stability under the
leadership of President Robert Mugabe. He also praised the african
country for its determination to carry on with its reforms and to
develop its economy.
</P>
<P>
Mudenge said that the government of Zimbabwe sticks to the "one
China" policy, and such a position will not change despite the
"money diplomacy" pursued by the Taiwan authorities. "Any attempt
of the Taiwan authorities is doomed to failure," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Qian expressed his thanks for Zimbabwe's stand on the Taiwan
issue and its support to China's cause of reunification.

<P>
NEW DELHI, April 30 (Xinhua) -- India's first ever Grand Prix
track and field meet has been postponed because of conflict with
the country's parliamentary elections, a top sports official said
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The event, originally slated for May 8, was a Grade Two meet
sanctioned by the International Amateur Athletic Federation (IAAF).
</P>
<P>
But Lalit Bhanot, secretary of the governing body of Indian
track and field, said because the date coincided with the
vote-counting in the general elections, the grand prix could draw
little attention.
</P>
<P>
"The IAAF has agreed to our request and asked us to fix an
alternate date as early as possible," Bhanot said, adding a
probable date would be in August.
</P>
<P>
The IAAF stated that India could hold the meet in the last week
of August, but at least two days before the Berlin Grand Prix on
August 30, he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 30 (Xinhua) -- A third body was found in the
rubble of a guesthouse where mass killer Martin Bryant held three
hostages after slaughtering 32 people at Port Arthur in Tasmania,
Australia, police said.
</P>
<P>
This has brought the death toll of last Sunday's shooting
massacre to 35.
</P>
<P>
Police said that identification of the victims was difficult
because many of them did not wear certificates.
</P>
<P>
There were at least two Malaysians, two Canadians, possibly one
United State citizen and one person of Indian origin among the
dead, police said.
</P>
<P>
Among the 19 injured, two are Canadian diplomats.
</P>
<P>
The three bodies found in the ash at the guesthouse are yet to
be identified. Bryant kept up to three hostages in the house
after shooting dead 32 people with a semi-automatic rifle early
Sunday afternoon. He set fire on the house Monday morning shortly
before his arrest outside the house.
</P>
<P>
Police have released the names of some of the Australian
citizens who were killed or injured in the massacre, raising new
waves of grief and condemnation among the people around the
country. The victims aged between three and 72.
</P>
<P>
West Australia state Premier Richard Court said that the
massacre was "sickening" after learning that one of the women
victims was from his state.
</P>
<P>
Flags on commonwealth buildings around the country will flow on
half mast to mark a national mourning for the victims tomorrow.

conducive not only to China's economic growth, but to the growth
of world economy as well.

DAR ES SALAAM, April 30 (Xinhua) -- The new flux of Burundi
refugees into Tanzania's northwestern Kagera region has brought
their total population to 70,000.
</P>
<P>
The Ngara district commissioner in the region, Brigadier

<HEADLINE> China's Youngest Female Writer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 30 (Xinhua) -- In the mid-1980's, a female
university student in her early 20s drew the attention of the
Beijing literature and art circle with works full of what the
critics called "a distinctive feminine charm."
</P>
<P>
Ten years later, Chen Ran has become a member of the Chinese
Association of Writers and made her name both inside and outside
China.
</P>
<P>
At a friends' gathering at her Beijing residence, the
delicately-built Chen spoke with a gentle smile of her past.
</P>
<P>
"I was born in an intellectual family and therefore fostered a
keen interest in the arts. I studied music for a time but did not
become a musician, because literature is something more appealing
to me," she recalled.
</P>
<P>
Later she entered Beijing Arts University, where she spent much
time reading both Chinese and foreign literary classics and
critiques.
</P>
<P>
Her literary debut, the 1986 novel The Centenary Illness,
became an overnight success, published in several major literary
magazines, and widely regarded as a successful trial of pure
literature with an avant-garde nature.
</P>
<P>
"In that novel I tried to focus my sight on the psychological
world of university students, especially young females, and to
reveal the disillusionment, loneliness and rebellious disposition
of the younger generation," explained the young writer.
</P>
<P>
Since 1990, with the publication of more philosophical and
thoughtful works like "Nowhere to Bid Farewell", "Empty Windows",
and "Time and Cage", she has come closer to maturity in
psychological descriptions and become more unique in her writing
style.
</P>
<P>
Her fame of being a powerful psycho-analysis writer led to
invitations to visit Australia and to give lectures at several
universities in Europe and America.
</P>
<P>
"A domestic publishing house is planning to publish a
four-volume collection of my works," she added.
</P>
<P>
According to Chen, most of her works are based upon "continuous
retrospects" of her past life. But she did not say whether the
divorce of her parents in her childhood had cast a vital influence
upon her writing.
</P>
<P>
Though successful in her career, her house is not very big.
But it is cozy and furnished tastefully.
</P>
<P>
To the astonishment of her friends, Chen is also a highly
skillful cook, who prepared all the nice-looking and delicious
food for the gathering.
</P>
<P>
"I am very fond of drinking and chatting with my friends at
home. It is really a very good relaxation for me," she said.

<HEADLINE> China's Hi-tech Export Tops 10 Billion US Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Exports of hi-tech products from
China set a historical record of 10 billion US dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
But China's export market is tiny compared to developed
countries, says a leading commentary in Beijing today, adding that
the country is anchored down by its old reputation for making
"clumsy, big and crude" goods.
</P>
<P>
The country's total import and export value of hi-tech products
totalled 31.9 billion US dollars in 1995, representing a
18-percent rise, China's "Economic Daily" reported today.
</P>
<P>
Hi-tech exports performed superbly with a growth rate of 59.1
percent, the highest since 1985.
</P>
<P>
The export of personal computers (PCs) and telecommunication
products made up 60 percent of the total hi-tech exports, at a
value of six billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
A sharp rise was recorded in sales of electronic products with
a value of 1.4 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin, a leading port city in north China, ranked first in
the export of hi-tech products, snatching an export market worth
840 million US dollars, followed by Beijing at 640 million US
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The merit record indicates a significant breakthrough in
China's foreign trade which is characterized by exports of farm
and sideline products, raw materials and semi-finished products,
and the import of industrial goods, the paper's commentary said.
</P>
<P>
However, the figure is tiny compared with that of developed
countries. China-made products have not shaken off their
reputation of "clumsy, big and crude" on the world market. This
has prevented China from raising its market competitiveness, it
added.
</P>
<P>
Only if China produces more hi-tech products, and raises the
value of its products, can it increase its export and win bigger
market shares, the commentary said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Children Oppose Smoking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Half a million Chinese children
are trying to encourage their parents to quit smoking.
</P>
<P>
The youngsters have formed a mini-army of peaceful persuaders
in a nationwide drive to curb the increase in the country's smoker
population, already standing at 350 million.
</P>
<P>
Children across the country have joined in an one-year
anti-smoking publicity campaign, in which they are attempting to
advise family members to quit smoking, and to stop people who puff
cigarettes in public places with "no-smoking" signs.
</P>
<P>
Campaign organizers, the Soong Ching Ling Foundation and a
children newspaper, say the children have promised not to smoke,
or buy or sell cigarettes themselves.
</P>
<P>
The organizers believe that the drive will help the country, a
large tobacco producer and consumer in the world, to control its
growing smoking population, now including five million teenagers.
</P>
<P>
Chinese medical experts have warned that by the year 2025, two
million people -- today's teenagers -- will die of smoking-related
diseases annually.
</P>
<P>
Children who do not smoke are probably part of 460 million
passive smokers in China, who are affected mainly at home and in
public places, according to a national survey conducted early this
year.
</P>
<P>
So far, 26 cities, including Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenyang,
have banned smoking in public places.
</P>
<P>
Beijing has published a local regulation to ban smoking in
public places, which will be effective on May 15.

<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, April 30 (Xinhua) -- The Tumen River Zone helped by
China's rapid economic development is destined to be an ideal
place for long term overseas investment.
</P>
<P>
The zone covering parts of China, Russia and the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), is rich in natural and labor
resources.
</P>
<P>
A ministerial meeting involving China, Russia, DPRK, the
Republic of Korea (ROK), Mongolia and the United Nations
Development Program (UNDP) was held in Beijing recently to join
hands in financing the Tumen River Zone intergovernmental
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Chen Cai, director of the Northeast Asian Research Center of
Northeast China Teachers' University, called for more foreign
investment in the area by saying "It is the prime time to make an
investment."
</P>
<P>
Chen, an expert in Tumen River area, has carried out detailed
studies of the area. He said the area in eastern Jilin province is
part of the international cooperative project, as well as one of
Northeast China's two primary areas opened wider to the outside
world. It has been listed as China's only local project for
international cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"China's Tumen River Zone is a potential area for an investment
and trade area, and the costs in transport, land use and labor
service are one half of those in east and south China, and only
one third of those in Guangdong," Ian Daries, an official of the
United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNDIO) said
after a recent inspection of the area.
</P>
<P>
A survey showed that contractual overseas investment in Yanbian
Korean Autonomous Prefecture, where the Tumen River Zone is
located, totalled 800 million US dollars by the end of last
year.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 30 (Xinhua) -- the 29th annual meeting of the
Board of Governors of the Asian Development Bank opened here
today, focusing on economic development and economic cooperation
in the region.
</P>
<P>
Some 2,000 participants including government and official
delegates from its 56 members, as well as observers from
international organizations attended the opening ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of international banking, financial and development
institutions are also attending the three-day annual meeting.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening session, Philippine President Fidel
Ramos said, "Today, the Asian developing economies are the
best-performing in the world."
</P>
<P>
"Real gross national product (GNP) growth in Asia last year
averaged 7.9 percent, while the global average was at 2.6
percent," he added.
</P>
<P>
Compared on a global basis, he said that developing Asia's 7.9
percent average compares even more remarkably with Africa's 3.0
percent, 2.1 percent for its counterparts in Europe and the Middle
East, and negative 0.3 percent for Latin America,
</P>
<P>
However, he said that along with this experience of growth
comes a lesson that must not be forgotten.
</P>
<P>
Growth can only be sustained if sound economic management and
policies are pursued in member countries, and global cooperation
and regional teamwork are enhanced, he added.
</P>
<P>
"Equally important for us and this is particularly true for the
Philippines," he indicated, development must have a human face and
its condition must be actualized by the empowerment of the people
through social and economic reforms.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 30 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) has said it is satisfied with the pace of economic reforms
so far undertaken by the Kenyan government.
</P>
<P>
Visiting IMF boss Michel Camdessus told the Press here on
Tuesday that the institution has recently released funds to the
Kenyan government because it has implemented most of the economic
reforms they have been advocating.
</P>
<P>
He was refuting the claims of the unregistered opposition
party Safina (The Ark) that the IMF has compromised itself by
releasing to Kenya 220 million U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Michel Camdessus, who is the Managing Director of the IMF,
said the money is not meant to fortify any particular group or
political party, but to fortify the country in general.
</P>
<P>
The IMF job is to support and finance positive reforms, he
stated, adding the Policy Framework Paper published by the Kenyan
government recently, which outlines progress and further
development for the coming years, is the basis for the release
of the promised IMF funds.
</P>
<P>
Michel Camdessus said he is also satisfied with the assurance
from the Kenyan government to strictly abide by its budgetary
targets and expenditure controls.

<HEADLINE> Unauthorized Muslim Holidayers Sent Back to Sarajevo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Bosnian Serb police and the
NATO-led peace Implementation Force (IFOR) sent back to Sarajevo
300 Muslim civilians who had entered Serb territories without
prior arrangement.
</P>
<P>
The Serb radio quoted Serb police commander Goran Sefovac as
saying that the Muslims had been asked to stop but they
disregarded the warning and proceeded toward Trnovo, a Serb
district 30 kilometers southeast of Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
The Muslim civilians, who had wished to follow their religious
belief and visit their old homes and the graves of their relatives
on the Islamic festival of Kurban Bayram, were intercepted by Serb
civilians and then sent back to Sarajevo after Serb police and
IFOR troops intervened, Sefovac said.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of Muslim civilians attempted to enter Serb
territories last week without any agreement with the Serb or the
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).
</P>
<P>
Their maneuvers had caused clashes with local Serb civilians.
The IFOR troops had to intervene and even fired warning shots into
the air to disperse the melee.
</P>
<P>
The IFOR command said on Sunday that unauthorized maneuvers by
Muslims would not be allowed and added that any such attempts
would be stopped.
</P>
<P>
However, a Muslim visit to a Serb territory in Tesanj took
place without a hitch on Sunday in that the visit had been agreed
between local Serb and Muslim authorities and mediated by IFOR and
other international organizations, according to the Tanjug news
service.

ZAGREB, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Three Muslim refugees were killed
and more than 20 others wounded on Monday when they were trying to
cross into the Serb-controlled areas to visit their homes and
cemeteries.
</P>
<P>
The Sarajevo-based televisions said that small fires from the
Serbs killed two men and wounded three, including two in serious
conditions, when some 300 Muslims tried to return to their homes
in the northern Bosnian village of Sjenina.
</P>
<P>
The IFOR headquarters in Sarajevo only confirmed that two
persons were wounded in the incident and said that the situation
in the area was tense.
</P>
<P>
An old woman was killed in another incident, in which the Serbs,
with stones and hoes, attacked a convoy of six buses and other
vehicles carrying about 500 Muslims who tried to visit graves in
Trnovo, some 30 kilometers southeast of Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
Three persons were severely wounded while 15 others sustained
light wounds in the attack, the televisions said.
</P>
<P>
The embittered Muslims who failed to visit Trnovo then gathered
in front of the office of the international community's High
Representative Carl Bildt, protesting that they had not been
provided with escort for the visit.
</P>
<P>
Monday was the second day of Kurban Bayram, or the Feast of
Sacrifice, in which Muslims slaughter sheep and visit family
graves.
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Electioneering for the second
phase of polling for India's 11th Lok Sabha (lower house) on May 2
in 17 states and union territories has gathered momentum with top
leaders and candidates making their last sprint before the 5 p.m.
deadline today.
</P>
<P>
The second phase assumes great significance as it covers the
most populous and politically important state of Uttar Pradesh,
which has 85 Lok Sabha seats, the largest number of seats in the
country.
</P>
<P>
It also covers the political hotbed of Bihar, which holds the
second largest Lok Sabha seats of 54, the biggest state of Madhra
Pradesh, the Left Front-dominated West Bengal and two major
industrial states of Maharashtra and Gujarat, which are ruled
respectively by the Shiv Sena and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).
</P>
<P>
With first-round polling on April 27 over, political leaders
and candidates have now turned their focus on the second leg of
elections for the 204 Lok Sabha and 223 assembly seats, addressing
whistling-stop meetings in a bid to cover as many places as
possible.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister and President of the ruling Congress Party P.V.
Narasimha Rao, whose second Lok Sabha constituency -- Berhampur in
Orissa state -- is going to polls on May 2, is on a whirlwind tour
of Andhra Pradesh and Orissa Monday and Tuesday. He addressed a
number of meetings for party candidates in the northern part of
West Bengal last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
BJP prime ministerial candidate A.B. Vajpayee toured his
Lucknow, capital of Uttar Pradesh, constituency where he is pitted
against film star Raj Babbar of the Samajwadi (socialist) Party.
</P>
<P>
In his meetings, Vajpayee said that the BJP would stake its
claim to power even if it failed to get absolute majority in the
elections.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 6,000 candidates are involved in the second phase of
elections compared with the 3,300 aspirants for the 150 Lok Sabha
seats that had polling on April 27 in the first phase.
</P>
<P>
The fortunes of the prime minister, Vajpayee and some other
important political leaders will be decided on May 2.
</P>
<P>
The Thursday polling will bring to an end the voting exercise
in states of Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Goa
and Meghalaya.
</P>
<P>
The states going to first-day partial polling are Maharashtra
(24 of 48 Lok Sabha seats), Gujarat (12 of 26), Uttar Pradesh (33
of 85), Madhya Pradesh (20 of 40), West Bengal (20 of 42 Lok Sabha
seats and 140 of 294 assembly seats), Orissa (12 of 21) and Bihar
(20 of 54).
</P>
<P>
Polling in three Lok Sabha constituencies -- Lucknow, Hardoi
and Misrikh -- in Uttar Pradesh have been advanced to May 2 from
May 7 in view of local festival.
</P>
<P>
On the whole, electioneering in the second phase remained
low-key in view of the expenditure ceiling and model code of
conduct.
</P>
<P>
A total of 447 polling stations in the country started their
repolling today due to violence on April 27.

<HEADLINE> Government Doctors on Strike In Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, April 30 (Xinhua)-- Doctors in major government
hospitals in Sri Lanka are out on strike today in protest against
giving precedence to Cuban qualified doctors in appointments over
locally qualified individuals.
</P>
<P>
According to the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA)
sources, all post interns should be given employment on April 26
when they had qualified and there was no question of foreign
qualified doctors being given precedence over their local
counterparts.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that Health Minister A.H.M. Fowzie had agreed
to make post intern appointments immediately but to give these
appointments retrospective effects "must have Cabinet approval."
</P>
<P>
However, the GMOA declined to accept this position, saying that
Cabinet approval was not necessary to adhere to the practice of
the past and that the appointments should be given in the same
merit order adopted when internship appointments were given, the
sources added.
</P>
<P>
The GMOA launched a "sick note" campaign from April 27 whereby
doctors reported sick and crippled work in about 300 hospitals.
</P>
<P>
The current strike is affecting all government hospitals.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Reaffirms Opposition to NATO Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
reiterated his opposition to NATO's eastward expansion plan,
according to a report published today in Le Figaro.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin made the statement in an interview with a French
magazine.
</P>
<P>
As a product of the Cold War, NATO's strategy of eastward
expansion runs counter to European efforts to create the security
system to keep abreast of the new situation, the Russian President
was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
NATO, established in 1950s, no longer has any potential
enemies, he said, adding that the present conflicts and crises in
Europe made it necessary for NATO to make a complete revision of
the old security system.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin noted that the conflicts in the former Yugoslavia
showed the incompetence of the present European defense and
security system in solving such crises. The realities by the end
of this century demand Europe make and enforce preventive security
measures.
</P>
<P>
The European Union, as a powerful alliance, should be capable
of setting up a security system to avoid the recurrence of such
conflicts as in the former Yugoslavia, Yeltsin said.

<HEADLINE> Kidnap Suspect Arrested in Costa Rica </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The kidnappers of a German
tourist and her Costa Rican guide have been identified as members
of the former Nicaraguan "contras," police sources said today.
</P>
<P>
The identities of the kidnappers were exposed last Saturday
when Julio Cesar Vega Rojas, a Nicaraguan national, was arrested
with part of the 200,000-U.S.-dollar ransom on him.
</P>
<P>
The ransom was paid for the release of German tourist Nicola
Fleuchaus and Costa Rican tourist guide Susana Siegfried, a
naturalized Swiss, who had been kidnapped in January.
</P>
<P>
Both women were released in March after the ransom was paid.
</P>
<P>
Vega was a member of the contras group headed by Eden Pastora.
The group had operated in Nicaragua close to the border of Costa
Rica during the 1980s, attempting to overthrow the Sandinista
government.
</P>
<P>
Though Costa Rican police said that they arrested Vega on
Saturday, Vega told the press that he had been captured three days
earlier by the Nicaraguan army that later turned him over to the
Costa Rican police. He was brought to a jail in the northern part
of the country.
</P>
<P>
Costa Rican authorities would not rule out the possibility that
Urbina Lara could also be behind the January kidnap.
</P>
<P>
Siegfried, the Swiss-born tourist guide, said she was not sure
if she would be able to recognize Vega, because hoods had always
been placed on the heads of the two women in the presence of the
kidnappers.

<HEADLINE> India's BJP Leader Hopes to Get 200 Parliament Seats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, April 30 (Xinhua) -- A.B. Vajpayee, prime
ministerial candidate of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the
biggest opposition party in India, has said that his party was
looking for the wonder figure of 200-plus seats in the 11th Lok
Sabha (lower house) to form government at the center with the help
of some regional parties.
</P>
<P>
The Lok Sabha has 543 elective seats with the remaining two
seats filled by nomination. The BJP got 113 seats in the 10th Lok
Sabha.
</P>
<P>
Latest reports showed that the BJP would get 205 to 210 seats,
with major gains in Bihar, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra. In
Uttar Pradesh, the BJP would win between 65 and 70 seats out of
85, he said in Lucknow, capital of Uttar Pradesh, Monday.
</P>
<P>
When asked if the Congress Party would be a factor in getting
the 272 seats he would require for an absolute majority in the
parliament, he said that he would not think that a chunk of the
Congress would defect to join the BJP.
</P>
<P>
Some Congress leaders, however, would welcome a BJP government
rather let P.V. Narasimha Rao remain at the helm of affairs of the
Congress.
</P>
<P>
The president was bound to invite the BJP to form government in
the event of no single party or coalition of parties getting an
absolute majority.
</P>
<P>
With the prospect of the BJP emerging as the single largest
party in the 11th Lok Sabha, it would constitutionally have the
opportunity to form government and be given a stipulated time to
prove its majority on the floor of the house, Vajpayee said.

MONTEVIDEO, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Bank deposits in Uruguay
increased by 11.5 percent in local currency and 2.6 percent in
U.S. dollars during the first quarter of the year as compared
with the same period last year, said the central bank today.
</P>
<P>
The deposits in local currency increased by 387 million pesos
(50 million dollars) and in foreign currency by 164 million
dollars during the first three months of the year, according to
the bank.
</P>
<P>
The Banco Republica Oriental del Uruguay (BROU) reported that
the biggest increase in peso deposits represented 49 percent of
the total of the deposits made in local currency.
</P>
<P>
Dollar deposits grew by 88 million dollars in the private
banking sector during the first quarter to reach 3.956 billion
dollars, while the increase in the BROU was 76 million to reach a
total of 2.139 billion.
</P>
<P>
Dollar deposits increased 593 million in 1995 mainly because of
the return of capitals that had been invested in Argentine papers

LIMA, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Fossil remains of human beings who
lived 10,000 years B.C. were found in Peru, local reports said
today.
</P>
<P>
The fossil human remains were discovered in some caves in Mount
Sacja Sacja in the province of Aymaraes.
</P>
<P>
The discovery was made by accident when a group of researchers,
led by anthropologist Leonidas Torre Virlo, went on an expedition
to remote areas in the Aymaraes province.
</P>
<P>
Fossil remains of men were found in the caves in the mountains.
</P>
<P>
Carved rocks and shards of pottery were also in the eight
caves, one of which had been defiled whereas the others were still
sealed at the time of discovery.
</P>
<P>
The pot shards were believed to belong to the Wari culture and
it was inferred therefore that the caves had been occupied by
other pre-hispanic cultures that had engaged in hunting and
farming.

<HEADLINE> Last Panda in Spain Dies on Monday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Chu Lin, the last panda in Spain
and the only one born in Europe, died of prostatitis on Monday in
the Madrid Zoological Park.
</P>
<P>
Having difficulty to urinate and a stomachache since April 24,
the 14-year-old male panda was diagnosed suffering prostatitis.
Though catheterization was practiced, his illness worsened. Chu
Lin ran into a coma and died Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Chu Lin was born to Shao Shao, who were brought here together
with Chang Chang, a male panda, in 1978 as a token of friendship
to the Spanish people. The two did not have a baby panda for
years.
</P>
<P>
However, using the sperm donated by a male panda in London,
Shao Shao was pregnant through insemination. She gave birth to
two baby pandas on September 4, 1982. Only Chu Lin survived.
</P>
<P>
Chu Lin became the only panda in Spain when Shao Shao died in
1983 and Chang Chang died of cerebral haemorrhage in 1995.
</P>
<P>
As a mascot of the Madrid Zoological Park, Chu Lin was greatly
treasured by Spaniards. Thousands of children flooded into the
park to celebrate his birthday every year.
</P>
<P>
Chu Lin will be made a specimen and exhibited in the park
together with the specimens of Shao Shao and Chang Chang.
</P>
<P>
Panda is an endangered rare species. According to earlier
estimations, only about 1,000 pandas are now living in natural
reservations in southwestern China.

<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, April 29 (Xinhua) -- General Vigleik Eide, chief
international mediator, said today that he holds "guarded
optimism" toward the ongoing disarmament negotiations among the
various sides from the former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The Norwegian army general, who is presiding over the
negotiations under the surveillance of the Conference on Security
and Cooperation in Europe, told the press that the outcome of the
negotiations will depend heavily upon the development of the
situation in the former Yugoslavia and the implementation of the
Dayton peace accord.
</P>
<P>
Under the Dayton accord, a weaponry control protocol should be
initialed through the Vienna negotiations by June 6 this year.
</P>
<P>
Eide said all the negotiators agreed during the second round of
negotiations which ended last week that the deadline should be
honored.
</P>
<P>
Though the negotiators were moving toward a consensus
concerning the framework of the final agreement, they still have
to make concessions so as to reach a compromise in key issues and
the details, Eide said.
</P>
<P>
The next round of negotiations starts on May 6 while the fourth
and last round is scheduled to start on May 22, according to
Eide's time schedule.
</P>
<P>
The weaponry control protocol will be signed on June 6 while
ministers from the former Yugoslav republics are expected to sign
the protocol into a binding accord on June 11.
</P>
<P>
Eide said that more negotiations would follow and will aim at
the effective disarmament in the former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
He said that a failure to reach the weaponry control agreement
will have a negative impact on the peace process in the former
Yugoslavia.

<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, April 29 (Xinhua) -- President Ernesto
Samper appointed Jose Antonio Ocampo, director of the National
Planning Department, as the new finance minister today to replace
Guillermo Perry who resigned last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Ocampo, who was agriculture minister, is in London for an
economic seminar.
</P>
<P>
According to press reports, Perry resigned because of a
confrontation with President Samper and several other cabinet
members over economic policy.
</P>
<P>
Several weeks ago, Samper asked Perry for an emergency program
to reactivate the nation's economy.
</P>
<P>
But Perry opposed the program and said that a new tax law was
the way to curb the economic recession.
</P>
<P>
He decided to resign last Saturday when Perry found that four
other cabinet ministers authorized by the president held talks
with their economic unions without his knowledge.
</P>
<P>
Perry has been agriculture minister since August 7, 1994 when
Samper took office.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Perry today, Samper praised him for fulfilling
the important task of formulating the economic policy of the
government, defending the tax reform and preventing a financial
crisis.

<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Germany's economy will grow by only
0.5 percent in 1996, a group of independent advisers to the
government known as the "Five Wise Men" said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The group's assessment, released by the Economics Ministry on
Monday, was the most pessimistic prediction which is even lower
than the 0.75 percent forecast by the six major economic research
institutes.
</P>
<P>
The advisers said the economy in western Germany would stay
stagnant and the east of the country would have an increase of 4.5
percent.
</P>
<P>
The joblessness would reach 3.9 million this year, they said.
</P>
<P>
Though close to recession, the German economy will recover
later this year and grow by 2.5 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The "Five Wise Men" proposed the government to control public
spending, cut taxes and ease the burden on enterprises.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to vitalize its economy and hope to save 50 billion
marks (about 32 billion U.S. dollars), German Chancellor Helmut
Kohl has announced a radical welfare reform package last week,
calling for a two-year wage freeze for government employees and a
reduction in sick leave benefits.

BANGKOK, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Thailand and Vietnam have agreed
to accelerate the development of the Route 9 link through Laos,
according to a Bangkok Post report today.
</P>
<P>
Route 9, from Mukdahan of northeastern Thailand to Vietnam's
Danang, via Savannakhet, Laos, has been identified as being
beneficial to the sub-region, including Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
There is also a possibility that this east-west corridor will
establish a tourism link to Myanmar, the paper quoted Vietnamese
Deputy Foreign Minister Vu Khoan as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Asian Development Bank, the main advocate of the Greater
Mekong Sub-region Economic Cooperation scheme, has made the route
a priority project and is working on so-called soft infrastructure
to facilitate movement of goods and people between Yunnan of
China, Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, Thailand and Myanmar.

<HEADLINE> German Economic Growth, Employment to Fall: Think Tanks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The German economic growth will slow
down by 1.15 percentage points this year while the jobless rate
for the whole year will increase by 0.7 percentage points, the
country's six economic institutes said today.
</P>
<P>
In a spring report, the institutes predicted that economic
growth in western Germany will fall by 1.1 percentage points from
1.6 percent in 1995, while that in the east will decline by 2.6
percentage points from last year's 5.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
The economic growth will reach 2.5 percent in 1997, but the
prospects for employment are still discouraging, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The institutes predicted a 10.1 percent jobless rate for the
entire 1996, compared to 9.4 percent for last year. They said
unemployment "will hardly lessen" next year.
</P>
<P>
Unemployment in Germany has been hitting postwar record highs
since January. Last month, 4.141 million people, or 10.8 percent
of the work force, were getting jobless pay.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the number of jobless people in
Germany will total 3.9 million in 1996, 0.3 million more than last
year.
</P>
<P>
The report was written by the German Institute for Economic
Research in Berlin, the HWWA Institute for Economic Research in
Hamburg, the IFO Institute for Economic Research in Munich, the
Global Economy Institute at the University of Kiel, the Institute
for Economic Research in Halle, and the Rhineland-Westphalia

<HEADLINE> Perkins to Have Blood Tests to Identify Slump Cause </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 30 (Xinhua) -- World swimming champion Kieren
Perkins will have blood tests to help identify the reason for the
excessive drop of form, a Sydney newspaper reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The test for Perkins, the world record holder for the 400
meters, 800 meters and 1500 meters freestyle, would focus on the
the level of iron in the blood, whose defiency could cause the
lack of strength in the limbs, The Sydney Morning Herald said.
</P>
<P>
"If the tests do show up something it would be a relief, but
only if it's something he can easily recover from," coach John
Carew was quoted as saying by the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
In last week's national Olympic swimming trials, the
22-year-old Perkins failed to qualify for his favorite 400 meters
freestyle with a lowly fourth place.
</P>
<P>
He saved his face by qualifying for the 1,500 meters, finishing
second Saturday after 400 meters winner Daniel Kowalski.
</P>
<P>
Carew played down the possibility of Perkins swimming the 400
meters freestyle in the place of Malcolm Allen at the Atlanta
Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
According to speculations by Australian media, Allen, who
finished third and edged Perkins to the fourth place in the 400
meters in the trials, could give up his berth in exchange for a
spot in the relay team.
</P>
<P>
But Carew said, "To my knowledge the only people saying that
are in the media. Nobody has contacted either Kieren or myself.
</P>
<P>
"Our focus is now entirely on the 1500m," he said. "The fact
is Malcolm Allen qualified for the 400m and Kieren didn't."

<HEADLINE> Flood of Funds to Rebuild Schools in Reservoir Area </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 30 (Xinhua) -- China is pouring 240 million yuan
(28.9 million US dollars) into education in the Three Gorges Dam
area, today's "China Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
By the time the dam project is finished, 600 schools will have
been effected and almost 200,000 students will face resettlement.
</P>
<P>
Priority for the State Education Commission (SEC) funds will be
given to Wanxian, the city which will shoulder the bulk of
resettlement.
</P>
<P>
The SEC has provided 1.5 million yuan to help build teachers'
housing and support education in the city.
</P>
<P>
Wanxian has set up the first college to meet the needs of
resettled residents.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the SEC has allocated 42 million yuan to ensure
the nine-year compulsory education scheme can be carried out in
nine poverty-stricken counties in the city.
</P>
<P>
Kaixian county is to get World Bank loans worth 1.06 million US
dollars. The Three Gorges reservoir, on which work began last
year, will alleviate the threat of floods in the middle and lower
reachers of the Yangtze River, and should make the river better
for shipping. But it will also mean more than one million local
inhabitants will have to move.
</P>
<P>
As the deadline for the blocking of the river by the dam
approaches, the SEC has called on 22 provinces and cities and 45
educational departments to assist the 21 counties around the
reservoir area in the resettlement of the local people.

<HEADLINE> New AIDS Drugs Introduced in Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Two new AIDS drugs, claimed to be
more effective and have fewer side effects than old drugs, were
officially introduced in Thailand Monday.
</P>
<P>
The drugs, "Saquinavir" from Roche Company and "Ritonavir" from
Abbott Laboratories, are categorized as "protease inhibitors"
which could weaken the new HIV virus in the cell.
</P>
<P>
The drugs were introduced at an international seminar here
which was attended by medical experts from Asia, South Africa,
Australia and other countries.
</P>
<P>
Abbott Company said that Ritonavir can reduce the death rate of
patients in their last stage of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
Unlike the other drugs categorized as "nucleoside analogs"
which reduces the virus in the blood, the protease inhibitor
obstructs the growth of the virus before it can reach the cell,
the US company said.
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers said that currently there are only three
protease inhibitors registered in the United States --
"Saquinavir", "Ritonavir" and "Indinavir" of Merck Company.
</P>
<P>
The two drugs have been proposed to Thailand's Food and Drug
Administration for registration. The administration said that it
has to confirm the reported efficiency of the drugs before
approving their use in Thailand.

<HEADLINE> Cuban President Calls for Boosting Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, April 29 (Xinhua) -- President Fidel Castro said today
that Cuba will continue to develop the tourism industry because it
is an important source of income for the Caribbean nation.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the 17th Congress of the Cuban Workers' Union, the
Cuban leader said that the advance of tourism in Cuba implies
winning the battle of the survival of the revolution.
</P>
<P>
Castro said that the tourism industry is a resource which the
island cannot dispense with under current conditions.
</P>
<P>
According to earlier government reports, gross earnings by the
tourism sector have surpassed that of the sugar industry to become
Cuba's main foreign exchange earner.
</P>
<P>
In the first three months of this year, about 297,000 foreign
tourists visited the country, a 50 percent rise over the same
period of last year.
</P>
<P>
On tourism-related crimes in the country, the Cuban president
at the Cuban Worker's Union meeting advocated intensifying
measures to combat prostitution and drugs.
</P>

Meanwhile, participants at the meeting also asked for tougher
actions from the state and the society to fight against the

<HEADLINE> China to Set Up Foundation to Control Hepatitis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 30 (Xinhua) -- China will set up a foundation to
collect funds to increase hepatitis-B vaccination among children
in remote and poverty-stricken rural areas and carry out research
on viral hepatitis control, according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Minister of Public Health Yin Dakui said here Monday
that the target is to expand the coverage of hepatitis-B
vaccination to 50 to 60 percent of children in rural areas by the
year 2000, and to more than 90 percent in cities, according to the
paper.
</P>
<P>
About 85 percent of urban children are able to take hepatitis-B
vaccination at the recommended time, but the rate for rural areas
is only around 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Public Health included hepatitis-B vaccination
in the regular immunization program for children starting in 1992,
but the work was not carried out in the countryside until last
year.
</P>
<P>
Many families in poor and mountain areas do not know much about
the disease and can not afford vaccinations.
</P>
<P>
The US SmithKline Beecham Co. donated two million yuan (about
240,000 US dollars) toward the establishment of the National
Hepatitis Prevention and Treatment Foundation that is being
initiated by the Ministry of Public Health, the National Experts
Consultancy Committee on Viral Hepatitis Control and the Chinese
Academy of Preventive Medicine.
</P>
<P>
Five types of viral hepatitis have been detected in the
country, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
There are about 120 million people carrying the B-type virus,
of which 40 percent are pregnant women who might pass the disease
top their babies.
</P>
<P>
Each year, more than 300,000 people die from liver problems,
with about half caused by hepatitis-B and C.
</P>
<P>
The State spends 30 to 40 billion yuan (3.6 to 4.8 billion US
dollars) every year to treat hepatitis patients.

<HEADLINE> Panamanian Businessmen Strike Against Tax Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Proprietors of some 1,400
companies in the Duty-free Zone of Colon, eight kilometers west of
the Panamanian capital, held a strike today to protest against the
government's tax policy.
</P>
<P>
The 24-hour strike is sponsored by the Association of
Concessionnaires (AC) in the duty-free zone, in a bid to call the
government's attention to the crisis due to an "unpopular tax" law.
</P>
<P>
It's the second strike in less than 12 months launched by the
proprietors to protest the policy that increased taxes from 8.5
percent to 15 percent on their earnings from import-export
operations.
</P>
<P>
Giovanni Ferrari, president of the AC in the Duty-free Zone of
Colon, pointed out that the strike is a peaceful one and that it
has the backing of 95 percent of the warehouse owners.
</P>
<P>
According to businessmen in the duty-free zone, the general
strike demanding a modification of the tax law has caused 100
million U.S. dollars in economic losses.
</P>
<P>
The protesters also called for lifting bank restrictions
established by the government to control money laundering in the
zone.
</P>
<P>
Ricardo Ortega, president of the Panamanian Association of
Business Executives, called the strike a political movement and
urged politicians not to get involved in the confrontation between
the AC and the management of the duty-free zone.
</P>
<P>
The strike decision was made on Saturday in a meeting of the
AC, which was attended by about 200 businessmen who were trying to
force the government to reconsider the tax law.

<HEADLINE> U.S. President Releases 12 Million Barrels of Oil Reserves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 29 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today authorized the sale of about 12 million barrels of oil from
the nation's strategic petroleum reserves to drive down the rising
gasoline prices.
</P>
<P>
In a speech made during his trip to Miami, Clinton expressed
his concern about rapidly rising gasoline prices and said that he
ordered the U.S. Energy Department to pump up the nation's fuel
supplies.
</P>
<P>
By increasing supplies, such a move might drive down prices
which were rising 5 cents per gallon on average in the past two
weeks.
</P>
<P>
The average price of gasoline nationwide, including all grades
and taxes, was 1.36 U.S. dollars a gallon as of last Friday,
according to the Lundberg Survey of 10,000 gasoline stations.
</P>
<P>
That compares with 1.31 dollars on April 12 and was 14 cents
higher than a year earlier, the survey said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Clinton said he was asking Energy Secretary Hazel
O'Leary to review market circumstances and report within 45 days
"about the factors that led to the run-up in prices."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the American Petroleum Institute, the trade
association of U.S. oil companies, reacted negatively. It said in
a statement that the strategic reserve "was not intended to be
used to control prices or to dampen normal price fluctuations" but
only "to provide Americans a buffer in case of a major oil supply
disruption or shortage."

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The China International Marine
Containers (Group) Company Ltd. (CIMC), the largest container
maker in China, began to raise 50 million U.S. dollars through a
commercial paper program on the U.S. market.
</P>
<P>
Under a contract signed here today between CIMC and the Societe
Generale, the major French bank and one of the leading sponsors of
the program, the fund raising activity would be divided into two
stages.
</P>
<P>
The first stage, which was completed today, covers 30 million
U.S. dollars. The remaining 20 million U.S. dollars is scheduled
to close in July, according to a press briefing here today.
</P>
<P>
The program was arranged by the Bank of America and supported
by a letter of credit issued by the Societe Generale, which has
been operating in the United States for more than 50 years.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of America syndicated the credit with six other
banks: Societe Generale, Bank of China, Bank of Communications of
China, Commerz Bank, the Development of Singapore and
Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation.
</P>
<P>
CIMC, now also the second largest container manufacturer after
Jindo of the Republic of Korea, accounted for 25 percent and 15
percent of market shares, respectively, of total Chinese and
worldwide container production. It increased its output to
141,230 ton equivalent units (TEU) in 1995 from 18,700 TEU in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Chinese companies having previously raised funds on the U.S.
commercial paper market included the China Ocean Shipping (Group)
Company (COSCO), the country's largest state-owned shipping
company, the China National Chemical Import and Export
Corporation, and the China National Cereals, Oils and
Foodstuffs Import and Export Corporation.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Seles Sues Organizers for 16-million Dollars over Sabbing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Monica Seles is sueing the
organizers of the 1993 Citizens Cup where she was stabbed on the
back of shoulder for 16 million U.S. dollars, it was announced on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The claim was lodged just one day before such an action would
have been ruled out by a three-year limit.
</P>
<P>
Seles was stabbed in the back by a Steffi Graf fan on April 30,
1993, during a quarter-final match with Magdalena Maleeva at the
Citizens Cup.
</P>
<P>
Her lawyers filed the suit in the Regional Civil Court,
claiming Deutscher Tennisbund (DTB) Rothenbaum Turnier GmbH, the
commercial business which organised the event, failed to provide
adequate security.
</P>
<P>
Seles is seeking money for lost earnings and income. The
injuries -- physical, emotional and psychological -- kept her
sidelined for two-and-a-half year until last August.
</P>
<P>
She returned with an exhibition against Martina Navratilova,
then won the Canadian Open and advanced to the US Open finals,
where she lost to Germany's Steffi Graf.
</P>
<P>
Seles won the Australian Open in January, but has been
sidelined for the last three months by tendinitis in a shoulder.
</P>
<P>
Parche, a 38-year-old unemployed machine operator, admitted to
stabbing Seles in an attempt to help Graf regain the number one
ranking.
</P>
<P>
He was convicted of causing grievous bodily harm and was given
a two-year suspended sentence. Prosecutors hoped to charge him
with attempted murder and had asked for a two-year prison
sentence.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Step up Tourism Promotion Overseas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, April 30 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian Tourism Promotion
Board (BPPI) plans to spend some 22 million US dollars on
promotional campaigns overseas in the fiscal year 1996-97, 10
percent more than last year, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
BPPI Managing Director Wuryanti Sunario said Singapore, Japan,
Germany, Britain, the United States and Taiwan were Indonesia's
main tourism markets and therefore the promotional campaigns would
mostly be staged there.
</P>
<P>
According to the Tourism, Posts and Telecommunications
Ministry, the main markets contributed no less than 2.6 million or
62.3 percent of the total number of foreign tourists to Indonesia
in 1995.
</P>
<P>
"It is our strategy to attract foreign tourists facing the
tourism vision of the year 2005 in order to make this sector the
leading contributor to the country's foreign exchange earnings,"
Sunario said.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, Indonesia earned 5.2 billion US dollars from tourism,
up from 3.9 billion dollars in 1993. More than four million
tourists came to Indonesia last year.

<HEADLINE> Chechen Separatists Reportedly Get New Military Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Former Chechen field commander
Shamil Basayev has been appointed to be the commander-in-chief of
the Chechen separatist forces, the Itar-Tass news agency reported
late today.
</P>
<P>
The news service attributed its report to an inside source of
the Chechen rebels.
</P>
<P>
The 31-year-old Basayev was notorious for masterminding last
year's bloodshed in Budennovsk, southern Russia, where at least
120 people were killed in a shootout with the Russian troops.
</P>
<P>
A student of the Moscow Institute of Civil Engineering, Basayev
joined rebel leader Dzhokhar Dudayev's separatist campaign in 1991
and was responsible for several other armed conflicts including
the one in Abkhazia in 1993 and the one which happened last month
in Grozny, capital of the breakaway Russian republic.
</P>
<P>
Basayev is loyal to Dudayev, who was killed on April 21 in a
Russian rocket attack in the Chechen village of Gekhi-Chu.
</P>
<P>
But Yuri Plugin, first deputy prime minister of the Chechen
government, told Itar-Tass that he was not able to confirm the
appointment.
</P>
<P>
He was quoted as saying that Chechen terrorist activities could
escalate if the report was true.
</P>
<P>
Rumors have spread in the past few days that Zelimkhan
Yandarbiyev, successor of Dudayev, was assassinated. But it
cannot be confirmed independently.
</P>
<P>
Local news reports said, however, that the one who had been
killed was the niece of the former vice-president of the rebel
regime and not Yandarbiyev himself.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar to Export 20,000 Tons of Agro-Products in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar will export 20,000 tons of
beans and pulses next month.
</P>
<P>
According to today's official paper The New Light of Myanmar,
the Myanmar Ministry of Agriculture has signed contracts with
foreign countries for the export.
</P>
<P>
The ministry will use the returns from this transaction to

Myanmar's agriculture contributes 35 percent to exports, 40
percent to foreign exchange earnings and 40 percent to the GDP.
</P>
<P>
Annual growth rate of agriculture in the last four years
(1992-93 to 1995-96) ending on March 31 stood at 8.8 percent and

<HEADLINE> Interior Decoration Industry Booming in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 30 (Xinhua) -- The bare floors and plain brick
walls which used to characterize Chinese homes are fast
disappearing nowadays.
</P>
<P>
Instead, block-tiled floors, carpets, wallpaper and decorative
lighting are fast becoming parts of what Chinese families expect
in their new homes.
</P>
<P>
The age of interior decoration has arrived -- and in major
cities like Beijing and Shanghai it is causing a boom for makers
and suppliers of home decoration products.
</P>
<P>
Officials confirm that the interior decoration industry will be
worth 80 billion yuan a year in the coming five years.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the Ministry of Construction show that the
total cost of housing decoration work nationwide exceeded 60
billion yuan in 1995, up 50 percent over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
But even that only represents 60 percent of the nationwide
demand.
</P>
<P>
The fast-growing national economy and the steady rise in the
living standards of the Chinese people have created a demand for
comfortable and tasteful residential environments, according to
officials.
</P>
<P>
And more wage-earners, including workers, salespeople,
teachers, scientific and technological personnel and governmental
office staff can now afford well-decorated and well-equipped homes.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest statistics, the total savings deposits
of the country hit 3.3 trillion yuan in the first quarter of this
year.
</P>
<P>
Besides food, clothing and entertainment, ordinary Chinese
residents are spending more on decorating their houses.
</P>
<P>
In big cities like Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Harbin,
Nanjing, Shenzhen and Zhuhai, over 40 percent of the urban
households have decorated their houses, at an average cost topping
15,000 yuan. The total cost of house decoration materials in
Beijing exceeded 1.5 billion yuan in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some 32 percent of the urban households in
medium-sized cities and 25 percent of those in county-level cities
have decorated their homes, with the average expenditure ranging
from 3,000 yuan to 10,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Yao Yue'e, a 46-year-old textile worker in Shanghai, now lives
with her husband and daughter in a well-decorated apartment with
two bedrooms, a sitting room, a kitchen and a toilet. The
apartment boasts a parquet floor, graceful pendant lamps, plush
carpets, wallpaper and ornaments like fresh flowers and oil
paintings, in addition to a complete set of household electrical
appliances.
</P>
<P>
She said that all the married workers in her factory have moved
into new apartments with two rooms and a sitting room, benefiting
from the state's "comfortable housing" project, which is designed
to improve people's housing conditions. And all her neighbors have
decorated and modernized their houses, with expenditure on this
ranging from 10,000 to 50,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
According to the state's housing development plan for the
coming 20 years, China will complete the construction of new
residences with a total annual floor space of 200 million sq m,
and provide 4.5 million urban households facing housing
difficulties with an average of eight sq m in floor space each.
</P>
<P>
Experts here expect that by the year 2000 the country's total
housing floor space will hit five billion sq m, and a potential
total of 83 million apartments will be well-decorated, at a total
cost of 30 billion yuan each year.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, in the vast rural areas of the country housing
construction is proceeding at an even faster pace, completing 600
million sq m in floor space annually. It has become common for the
better-off farmers to live in stylish and well-equipped houses.
</P>
<P>
The experts estimate that the farmers will spend about 25
billion yuan in the coming five years to fit up their residences.
</P>
<P>
And the interior decoration sector, nurtured by people who are
getting better-off, will grow at a rate of over 50 percent in the
coming five years.

<HEADLINE> NATO Expansion Should Not Isolate Russia, Solana Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The NATO eastward expansion should
not lead to the isolation of Russia, NATO Secretary-General Javier
Solana said here today.
</P>
<P>
Solana voiced his hope that Russia could play an important role
in ensuring Europe's stability and security.
</P>
<P>
Solana, who arrived here for a day-long visit today, made the
remarks when meeting with Czech President Vaclav Havel and Prime
Minister Vaclav Kalus on the controversial expansion.
</P>
<P>
Russia is firmly against the NATO enlargement.
</P>
<P>
However, the NATO chief did not make it clear when the Czech
Republic will join the 16-country organization, which was founded
in April 1949.
</P>
<P>
Prague has applied for the NATO membership and proposed the
beginning of the NATO-Czech talks on its application.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Havel said that the NATO expansion is a
complicated political process.
</P>
<P>
Solana is scheduled to leave here for Slovakia late today.

<HEADLINE> NZ Suffers First March Quarter Trade Deficit in Decade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, April 30 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand's trade balance
went into red in the March 1996 quarter, the first trade deficit
for the quarter since 1986.
</P>
<P>
Statistics NZ said in a press release received today that in
the three months to March, foreign trade recorded a deficit of 6
million NZ dollars (about 4 million US dollars), compared with a
surplus of 541 million NZ dollars (about 368 million US dollars)
for the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The deficit left the trade balance 859 million NZ dollars (584
million US dollars) in red for the year ending March 1996, while
in the previous year, trade registered a surplus of 293 million NZ
dollars (199 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Sliding exports to Australia, NZ's largest trading partner, was
partly to blame for the yearly deficit. NZ has lost its recent
trade surplus with Australia by chalking up a 544
million-NZ-dollar (370 million-US-dollar) deficit in the year.
</P>
<P>
The rising NZ dollar was considered as the culprit for the
worsening trade situation with Australia. The NZ dollar was traded
at 77 Australian cents two years ago, jumping to 92 Australian
cents last year, and staying at around 87 Australian cents at
present.

higher today, extending a record-setting rally for some indexes.

The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index struggled higher to
its eighth straight record closes. It rose 1.31 to 1,188.20.

<P>
CANBERRA, April 30 (Xinhua) -- Following are major news items
in leading Australian newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The Australian
</P>
<P>
-- Prime Minister Howard yesterday ordered an emergency meeting
of state police ministers to toughen gun laws and draw up a
national plan for firearm registration as the nation reeled from
the Port Arthur massacre.
</P>
<P>
The Sydney Morning Herald
</P>
<P>
-- A nation asks why, the portrait of a lone gunman, Martin
Bryant, should have no reason to be a killer. The man arrested
after the Port Arthur massacre should be a wealthy man, only four
years ago he inherited more than 500,000 Australian dollars
(375,000 US dollars) from one of the heirs of George Adams's great
Tattersalls fortune.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Financial Review
</P>
<P>
-- The federal government plans sweeping reform of the national
training system, with apprenticeship numbers to increase and
business to be given more say in training programs.
</P>
<P>
The Age
</P>
<P>
-- Police were standing guard last night over the hospital bed
of 28-year-old Martin Bryant, suspected of the massacre of at
least 34 people at Port Arthur.

<HEADLINE> UN Financial Situation Remains Precarious </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The financial situation of
the United Nations remains precarious despite the fact that 53
countries have paid their assessments in full, the chief U.N.
financial officer said today.
</P>
<P>
Joseph Connor, under-secretary-general for administration and
management, told the press that assessments unpaid by member
states aggregate 2.8 billion U.S. dollars, of which 1.5 billion is
owed by the United States, 400 million by the Russian Federation,
and 250 million by Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
As to the cash position, he said, regular budget cash forecast
presented to the member states in February estimated the U.N.
would have a regular cash balance of 79 million U.S. dollars at 30
April. In fact, the regular budget cash balance tomorrow will be
zero, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the shortfall in regular budget cash is due largely to
payments from three member states -- the United States, Germany
and Japan -- not fully meeting the forecasts they had provided in
February to the organization.
</P>
<P>
In this case, Connor said, the U.N. will have to borrow, once
more, from peacekeeping funds to meet regular budget obligations.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Likely to Meet Arafat This Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 29 (Xinhua)-- U.S. President Bill Clinton is
likely to meet Palestinian President Yasser Arafat when he flies
in here for a visit this week, the White House said today.
</P>
<P>
"The president is expected to meet with him later this week,"
White House deputy press secretary Ginny Terzano told reporters
when traveling with Clinton on a day trip to Miami.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, who met Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak earlier today
for talks on the Mideast peace process, leaves for the United
States from Cairo for talks with the Clinton administration on the
next steps in Palestinian-Israeli peace talks, U.S. and Egyptian
officials said.
</P>
<P>
A White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
told reporters that it was the White House "intention" to arrange
a meeting between Clinton and Arafat, "but nothing is set yet."
</P>
<P>
Arafat's arrival will coincide with the departure of Israeli
Prime Minister Shimon Peres. Peres will wrap up his three-day
visit to the United States Tuesday during which Clinton approved
several defense-oriented agreements with Israel, including a
U.S.-Israel pact to fight terrorism.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian Parliament voted last Wednesday to revoke
charter clauses calling for the destruction of Israel, and the
Jewish state described the reversal as the ideological decision of
the century.
</P>
<P>
Peres said this month that talks with the Palestine
Liberation Organization on the final status of the West Bank and
Gaza Strip would begin on May 4 as scheduled.

<HEADLINE> Ireland Supports Parallel Talks on Ulster Arms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Irish Foreign Minister Dick Spring
said today that the Irish government supported plans for parallel
talks to tackle the issue of arms decommissioning by rivals
paramilitary groups in Northern Ireland, according to reports from
Dublin.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to an Anglo-Irish inter-parliamentary conference in
Limerick, the Irish Republic, Spring said decommissioning was an
essential element in the Northern Ireland peace process and there
was a strong argument in favor of remitting this issue to an
"independent outside aegis."
</P>
<P>
However, the Irish leader stressed that he did not want to see
it derailing the political negotiations on the future of Northern
Ireland.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time the British government has given details
of its proposals to negotiate the arms issue separately.
</P>
<P>
Spring's remarks were welcomed by Britain's Tory member of
parliament Peter Temple-Morris, co-chairman of the Anglo-Irish
inter-parliamentary body, but the British side did not agree with
the proposals made by Spring.
</P>
<P>
The British side reiterated that arms decommissioning had to be
dealt with as the first subject in the planned all-party talks
scheduled for June 10.
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, the British side insisted, Ulster Unionists, who
strongly defend British rule over Northern Ireland, could not
become involved in the peace process.

<HEADLINE> Crews Fight to Contain Fire From Reaching Weapons Lab </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Firefighters burned brush in
the path of a forest fire today to prevent it from reaching the
Los Alamos nuclear weapons laboratory and ancient Indian ruins
in northern New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
The fire, having burned 14,500 acres over five days, was moving
over parched, rugged hills and canyons to within six miles of the
Los Alamos National Laboratory, local press reports said.
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of concern among some people about nuclear
materials being lofted into the air," spokesman John Gustafson was
quoted by the Associated Press as saying.
</P>
<P>
Emergency crews removed explosives from one building in the
line of fire as a precaution. Explosives in a second building are
stored in fireproof bunkers surrounded by earthen berms, he said.
</P>
<P>
Trace amounts of tritium, a radioactive isotope used to
increase the power of nuclear weapons, are housed in a third,
fireproof building. Gustafson said the radioactivity was not great
enough to pose a health hazard even if it escaped.
</P>
<P>
The fire was burning at an elevation of 8,000 to 8,500 feet in
the Santa Fe National Forest and Bandelier National Monument,
northwest of Santa Fe.
</P>
<P>
Crews set a fire ahead of the blaze, igniting leaves, branches
and stumps that the flames feed on. Airplanes dropped fire
retardant, and more than 800 firefighters fought the blaze on the
ground.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Forest Service officials said they don't expect to contain
the fire fully for another week.
</P>
<P>
Authorities believe the fire started from an illegal campfire
built by Gregory Steele, 27, of Taos and Farid Touchi, 23, of
Germany. The men were arrested Saturday.

<HEADLINE> UK Business Chief Slams Notion of Withdrawal From EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Adair Turner, leader of the
Confederation of British Industry (CBI), denounced today calls for
Britain to pull out of the European Union, according to a BBC TV
report this evening.
</P>
<P>
The CBI's director-general derided the notion advocated this
morning by Norman Lamont, former chancellor of the exchequer, that
Britain could prosper by withdrawing from Europe.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that a successful single market required a "basic
framework of rules" which its member states should abide by.
</P>
<P>
But Turner also revealed his doubt about a single European
currency when he said that the British government was "absolutely
right" to keep an open mind on the European money union.
</P>
<P>
The British business leader also supported the government to
maintain the opt-out from the Social Chapter of the Maastricht
Treaty.

<P>
WASHINGTON, April 29 (Xinhua) -- A pipe bomb exploded in a
doorway of the City Hall of Spokane, Washington State, early
this morning, with no injury reported as the building was
unoccupied.
</P>
<P>
The bomb with packed nails blasted at about 3 a.m. and debris
was scattered for more than 100 yards in front of the building,
an Associated Press report said.
</P>
<P>
"If this had been a crowded day, if we had had a lot of people
out here, we would have had very, very serious and very, very many
injuries," Police Chief Terry Mangan said.
</P>
<P>
No one claimed responsibility for the bombing, and Mangan said
it was not known if the explosion was related to other bombings,
such as a package that detonated this morning at a Jewish center
in Calgary, Alberta.
</P>
<P>
The federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and the FBI
were called in, and other municipal buildings, bridges and
communications sites were searched as a precaution, but no other
devices were found, Mangan said.
</P>
<P>
On April 1, a small bomb exploded in a bank when a group of
masked men was robbing it in suburban Spokane Valley and another
pipe bomb had exploded outside a nearby suburban office of a local
newspaper in the same day.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Urges Developing Countries For Free </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 29 (Xinhua) -- The South African
government today called for trade efficiency, saying
globalisation and liberalisation of world trade would benefit
developing countries.
</P>
<P>
South African Trade and Industry Minister Alec Erwin made the
remarks at the National Executive Symposium on Trade Efficiency
which is part of the program of United Nations Conference on
Trade and Development held in Midrand today.
</P>
<P>
Erwin said trade efficiency is particularly important to South
Africa in the light of reduced tariffs.
</P>
<P>
"As trade protection and export subsidies are progressively
dismantled, our enterprises have to find new ways of maintaining
their relative competitiveness at home and abroad," said the
minister.
</P>
<P>
Erwin said trade efficiency by contributing to the lowering of
the cost of trade transactions should play the priority role in
ensuring South Africa's competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
Trade efficiency is especially important for the development
of small-and-medium-size businesses in South Africa, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Swiss Secretary of State for Economic Affairs Franz
Blankart said the Program of Trade Efficiency was designed to
integrate developing countries into the world trading system by
reducing transaction costs, improving export potential, and
providing entrepreneurs with data and trade-related services.
</P>
<P>
He noted that poorer countries often lacked the basic
infrastructure to benefit from the opportunities of freer trade
and reduced trade barriers.
</P>
<P>
"We have a duty to assist these countries to enable them to
participate in world trade," said Blankart.
</P>
<P>
He said the trade efficiency initiative called for the setting
up of trade points which are connected by the internet in all
developing countries to enable users to receive and send out
information on products, markets and trade regulations.
</P>
<P>
Erwin said by spearheading efforts to establish trade points
in South Africa, the government is showing the way toward the
greater participation of the small-and-medium-size enterprises in
global trade.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Outlines New Anti-Drug Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 29 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
put forward a new national anti-narcotics strategy at a middle
school in Miami today.
</P>
<P>
Announcing what he described as a new 10-year strategy, Clinton
proposed 15.1 billion dollars in federal drug control activities
in the fiscal 1997 budget, an increase of 9.3 percent over the
13.8 billion dollar level in the current fiscal year, according to
media reports.
</P>
<P>
Addressing several hundred students of the George Washington
Carver Middle School, Clinton said his latest anti-drug plan
focuses on programs to convince youngsters to abstain from drug
use.
</P>
<P>
In addition to battling drug use among youth and drug-related
violence, Clinton's five-point strategy consists of programs to
reduce drug-related health and welfare costs, step up protections
at U.S. borders and break both domestic and international drug
supply lines.
</P>
<P>
The new strategy also describes a heightened emphasis on
methamphetamine, which is blamed for a surge of drug-related
deaths in Western U.S. cities and which could reach "pandemic
proportions" nationwide if left unchecked.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that drug use in the United States is declining
overall, but it is increasing among those under age 18; and that
overall crime rates are down, but rates of random violence among
those under age 18 are increasing.
</P>
<P>
The new strategy is issued in the form of a 100-page report
titled "The National Drug Control Strategy: 1996."

<HEADLINE> Peres: Israel Ready to Help Rebuild Southern Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, April 29 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Shimon
Peres expressed here today his nation's willingness to help
rebuild the war-ravaged southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
"If the Lebanese are ready to, we are ready to consider to help
to reconstruct the part of southern Lebanon," Peres said when
speaking to the Washington Institute for Near East Peace.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese officials said that the two weeks of Israel's air
raids in earlier April killed hundreds of civilians and caused an
estimated 1 billion U.S. dollars in damage.
</P>
<P>
Israel has alleged that the raids were an retaliatory operation
against rocket attacks by the Islamic Hezbollah guerrillas based
in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher brokered a
cease-fire last Friday between Israel and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Peres, who arrived here Sunday for a three-day visit, and U.S.
Defense Secretary William Perry signed on the same day a "joint
statement of intent" to strengthen U.S.-Israel defense cooperation
against missile attacks against Israel.
</P>
<P>
Peres told the Washington Institute for Near East Peace that
the time had come for the United States and Israel to form a study
group to examine a possible bilateral defense pact.
</P>
<P>
But he acknowledged that there would be "certain
advantage...certain problems" for such a pact.
