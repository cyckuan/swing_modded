<HEADLINE> Turkey Calls for Solving Aegean Sea Islet Dispute with Greece through Negotiations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Turkey today demanded that
Greece withdraw its troops from Imia (Kardak) rocks in the Aegean
Sea and called for holding negotiations to solve the dispute.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish government said in a statement that Turkey is
committed to defusing, rather than increasing, tension in this
region.
</P>
<P>
Turkey said it is ready to enter into negotiations with Greece,
with a view to determining the possession of small islands, islets
and rocks in the Aegean.
</P>
<P>
The statement said "Greece issued bellicose statements on
January 28 regarding the status of the Kardak rocks, which is only
3.8 miles off the coast of Turkey in the Aegean Sea. This is yet
another example of unfounded Greek claims to sovereignty."
</P>
<P>
The statement added that "it is obvious that the possession of
the small islands, islets and rocks in the region -- the status of
which have not been clearly defined by international documents --
has yet to be determined by agreement."
</P>
<P>
Therefore, attempts by Greece to inhabit the small islands,
islets and rocks in question can in no way create any legal
consequences in regard to their status, the Turkish government
said.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Foreign Minister Deniz Baykal has summoned the Greek
ambassador in Ankara and gave him a protest note claiming the
islet belonged to Turkey and asked Greece to withdraw the 12
soldiers stationed there.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Greek Defense Minister Gerasimos
Arsenis claimed in a news conference today that "the islet of Imia
is Greek and it is the responsibility of the armed forces to
defend Greek territory."
</P>
<P>
He added that the Greek armed forces are in full readiness to
deal with any threat against Greek territory.
</P>
<P>
The escalation in tension between the two NATO members
surfaced a week ago, when a Turkish ship crashed into the twin
rock group with a total area of four hectares, which is 3.8
nautical miles away from the Turkish shore and 11 nautical miles
from he Greek island of Kalimons.
</P>
<P>
It grew worse through the remarks of Greece's new Foreign
Minister Theodoros Pangalos who said that Turkey had "claimed
Greek land for the first time."
</P>
<P>
Greece and Turkey nearly went to war in 1987 in a dispute over
mineral rights in the Aegean. They argued last year over whether
Athens has the right to extend its territorial waters in the
Aegean to 12 miles from six miles.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Welcomes Appointment of EU Representative </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 30 (Xinhua) -- The Cyprus government today
welcomed the decision of European Union (EU) to appoint a
representative of the presidency for Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference here, Foreign Minister Alecos
Michaelides described the EU decision, taken in Brussels by the EU
Council of Ministers Monday, as "very important" and "a positive
step."
</P>
<P>
"We welcome the fact that the EU concerned itself with its
involvement to help the efforts solve the Cyprus question. This
signals the first step, which I hope will develop further," the
Minister said.
</P>
<P>
The EU decision says that "the council decided to appoint
ambassador Federico Di Roberto representative of the presidency
for Cyprus who will visit the region in view of his report to the
council and the recommendations he will make."
</P>
<P>
Michaelides believes the report will be submitted before the
end of the current Italian EU presidency, which expires at the
end of June, and the recommendations are likely to involve
suggestions on EU involvement in efforts to settle the Cyprus
question.
</P>
<P>
"We appreciate Italy's interest but we are more interested in
seeing the EU, as a whole, being involved in Cyprus following a
decision by the EU council," Michaelides said.
</P>
<P>
The Minister also disclosed that EU Commissioner Hans Van Den
Broek will be in Cyprus in early March for contacts with the
government to be briefed on efforts to settle the Cyprus
problem.
</P>
<P>
The EU's initiative is regarded here as part of intensified
peace efforts by the U.N. and international community started
since the beginning of this year.
</P>
<P>
The year 1995 witnessed stalemate in peace process of Cyprus
problem, created as a result of Turkish military intervention and
taking control of northern third of the island following an
Athens-backed coup in 1974.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 30 (Xinhua)-- A World Bank financial
agency today revealed an ambitious plan of investment in South
Africa, saying his institute would not impose any "limit" to
the investment.
</P>
<P>
"The limitation of capital is not a problem," Jannik Lindbaek,

The World Bank official said his agency hoped to pour an

dollars in South Africa in the next three years.
</P>
<P>
Lindbaek, who just completed a visit to South Africa, said he

</P>
<P>
The IFC has already approved four equity investments in the
country valued at around 10 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The official said IFC's current strategy was to help
disadvantaged entrepreneurs forge links with the developed
sectors of the economy and with foreign private capital.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslav PM Urges West to Unblock Overseas Assets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav Prime Minister Radoje
Kontic has urged the U.S., Britain, France, Switzerland and
Denmark to unblock Yugoslavia's deposits in their banks.
</P>
<P>
In letters sent to his British, French, Swiss and Danish
counterparts and the U.S. Secretary of State, Kontic said the
further freezing of Yugoslav overseas assets would be in violation
of the international law, according to a Yugoslav foreign ministry
statement today.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia's foreign assets were all frozen in May, 1992, when
the United Nations imposed an overall sanction against the Balkan
country for its alleged involvement in the Bosnian civil war. The
sanctions were suspended last November to reward Belgrade's
important role in the regional peace process, but the final
lifting would not begin until the beginning of the general
elections in Bosnia in the Autumn of this year.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said there was no reason to continue
freezing Yugoslav national bank's assets abroad because of the
suspension of the U.N. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
"If the assets remain blocked, the principle of the equal
treatment of all sides would be brought into question," the letter
said.
</P>
<P>
Kontic also said talks on the overall division of the former
Yugoslavia's assets and debts were under way among the former
republics, and the freezing of the Yugoslav central bank's assets
alone would prejudice the final solution to the issue.
</P>
<P>
"There is no ground in international law or practice for
further keeping the assets blocked. The continued freezing of the
assets could have negative impact on the achievement of a lasting
and just peace and stability in the region," he warned.

<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus President Glafcos
Clerides will meet Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis here on
February 8, government spokesman Yiannakis Cassoulides announced
here today.
</P>
<P>
This will be the first meeting between Clerides and Simitis,
who was elected recently as Prime Minister of Greece and replaced
Andreas Papandreou.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman did not disclose the planned content of
discussion between the two leaders, but political analysts here
expect that the Cyprus problem and the issue of Cyprus' EU
accession will be top on the agenda.
</P>
<P>
Cassoulides told his daily press briefing that the Cyprus
government welcomes with great satisfaction the Greek
government's political program outlined Monday by Simitis
in the Greek parliament, which embraces the efforts for a solution
to the Cyprus problem and the island's bid to become a full
member of the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
Cyprus is also satisfied with Simitis' statement concerning a
joint defense pact concluded by Greece and Cyprus in November
1993, which the Greek Prime Minister described as "an option" for
a just political solution to the Cyprus problem, the spokesman
added.
</P>
<P>
In his statement to the Greek parliament, Simitis said that
"the constant goal of our defense policy is the reversal of any
military threat against Greece and Cyprus."
</P>
<P>
He reiterated Greece's firm support to the Cyprus government
to "pursue the creation of those conditions which would allow the
peaceful reversal of the fait accompli through various
initiatives for a just and viable solution".
</P>
<P>
On Cyprus' accession to the EU, Simitis said the process
for Cyprus' entry constituted a priority issue for Greece's
foreign policy, thereby strengthening the efforts for a peaceful
and just solution to the Cyprus problem.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 30 (Xinhua) -- An Israeli soldier was
stabbed and critically wounded today by a Hamas assailant in
the District Coordinating Office (DCO) in the Jenin area,
the West Bank. He later died from his wounds in hospital.
</P>
<P>
According to Israel Radio, the soldier was working in the
office when the assailant stabbed him in the chest several
times after a metal detector found a knife he was carrying.
Until then, the Hamas activist had walked in undetected.
</P>
<P>
The assailant was arrested immediately after the incident and
confessed the attack.
</P>
<P>
The joint Israeli-Palestinian DCO is located at the southern
entrance to Jenin.
</P>
<P>
In response, Israeli Internal Security Minister Moshe Shahal
said that Israel must react assertively towards the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA).
</P>
<P>
Israeli Foreign Minister Ehud Barak said that the army would
work to prevent similar attacks.
</P>
<P>
Israeli coordinator of activities in the West Bank and the
Gaza Strip Oren Shahaul told the PNA that they were responsible
for the attack and were not doing enough to combat violence.
</P>
<P>
He said that it was also a stab in the back of those
Palestinians who come to receive various services from the DCO in
Jenin.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Housing Minister Binyamin Ben-Eliezer, a former
coordinator of activities in the West Bank and the Gaza
Strip, warned the PNA that such attacks could endanger the
peace process and make it collapse.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on Israel Radio, he said that the PNA must take
urgent actions to stop violence by Islamic extremists.

<HEADLINE> UK Fails to Allay Sinn Fein's Fears about Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams
said today that his party will not accept the British government's
proposal for an elective body to negotiate all-party peace talks
in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
After talks with Patrick Mayhew, Britain's Northern Ireland
Secretary in Belfast, Adams stressed that Sinn Fein was
"implacably opposed" to the elections notion announced by British
Prime Minister John Major on January 24.
</P>
<P>
He told Mayhew that the government had the onus to scrap its
pre-conditions for all-party talks.
</P>
<P>
And he urged Major to follow the recommendations made by the
international commission in charge of arms decommissiong process
and to meet the objective of talks scheduled to begin by the end
of February.
</P>
<P>
Mayhew said that he was surprised at Sinn Fein's opposition to
the plans for elections in Northern Ireland as people in the
province had expressed their desire for polls.
</P>
<P>
He said he had tried to allay Sinn Fein's fears about such an
election, which was "an alternative route" to getting various
parties concerned round the table talking.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP), the
largest Catholic nationalist party in Ulster, also warned Prime
Minister Major that elections in the troubled province cannot go
ahead without the support of Ulster nationalists and the Irish
Republic.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Major is to meet SDLP leader John Hume to
discuss his elections notion this afternoon.

<HEADLINE> COMESA Chief On Clearing House's Location </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 30 (Xinhua) -- The Common Market for Eastern
and Southern Africa (COMESA) has not decided whether to relocate
its clearing house from Harare if Zimbabwe refuses to ratify the
treaty establishing the organization, the COMESA chief said
today.
</P>
<P>
COMESA Secretary General Wa Mutharika was responding to
reports that COMESA was contemplating shifting its clearing house
from Zimbabwe's capital city to members that have ratified its
treaty.
</P>
<P>
COMESA, formed in 1993, is a transformation of the now defunct
Preferential Trade Area for Eastern and Southern Africa. Only 13
out of the 20 member states which signed the treaty have ratified
it.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe, which caused controversy when it delayed by a month
signing the COMESA treaty in 1993, has joined the regional
grouping but refuses to ratify the treaty.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe, Kenya and South Africa are regarded as major traders
whose membership is needed to ensure COMESA's survival.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe's reluctance to ratify the treaty stems from a
directive by the 12-member Southern African Development Community
(SADC) to which it also belongs that members must choose between
the two.
</P>
<P>
Wa Mutharika said his organization is eager to hold a joint
summit with SADC to resolve the issue of dual membership.

<HEADLINE> Tension Between Greece and Turkey Escalates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, January 30 (Xinhua) -- The tension between Greece and
Turkey over the dispute of the Imia island escalated today with
the Greek side accusing Turkey of violating its territorial waters
and airspace.
</P>
<P>
According to Greek defense minister Gerassimos Arsenis, the
Turkish "meko-2000" frigate and helicopters violated Greece's
territorial waters and airspace early today near the island of
Imia in the eastern Aegean. A Greek navy warship warned the
frigate to Leave Greek territorial waters, while Greek warplanes
intercepted the Turkish helicopters.
</P>
<P>
However, the minister said, the Turkish frigate was still
staying in the area.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, two Turkish patrol boats were reportedly sailing
near Imia, but inside Turkish territorial waters.
</P>
<P>
Under such circumstances, Arsenis said, Greek armed forces on
land and in the air have been placed on "a high level of alert".
</P>
<P>
He also revealed that Greek troops have been sent to guard the
the island of Imia.
</P>
<P>
The escalation of the tension relations between the two
countries started last weekend, when three Turkish journalists
landed on the deserted rock island of Imia by helicopter and took
down the Greek flag and raised the Turkish one.
</P>
<P>
After a meeting chaired by Greek Prime Minister Costas Simitis,
Arsenis and foreign minister Theodoros Pangalos gave a joint press
conference at which both officials indicated that Greek side would
defend its territorial sovereignty with determination.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on washington's call on Athens and Ankara to reach a
compromise on the entire issue through dialogue, both Pangalos and
Arsenis stressed that "there can be no question of a dialogue on
issues pertaining to our sovereign rights."

HARARE, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Registrar-General
Tobaiwa Mudede declared here today voters roll as satisfactory
for the March presidential elections, but shrugged off calls by
the opposition for him to resign over allegations that he had
failed to conduct elections properly.
</P>
<P>
He said that an estimated number of 4.9 million people were on
the roll, about 100,000 more than in the parliamentary elections
last year. Zimbabwe has a population of about 10.5 millions.
</P>
<P>
''The roll can never be totally perfect,'' he said, ''it must
be in a satisfactory state.''
</P>
<P>
Opposition ZANU (Ndonga) leader Reverend Ndabaningi Sithole on
Monday called on Mudede to resign, saying that he was not
''morally conscious'' to run the elections. Sithole also called
for a postponement of the elections to allow for changes to the
electoral process before his party could join in the race.
</P>
<P>
Mudede said, ''It is their (the opposition) thinking and I
have no comment on that particularly when I am left with one day
to go into elections...I don't think it's prudent for me to
comment.''
</P>
<P>
The nomination court for the elections will seat in Harare on
Thursday to receive nominations for the poll to chose Zimbabwe's
new President for the next six years.
</P>
<P>
Mudede said that the poll, if there was more than one
candidate, would cost around 78 million Zimdollars (8.7 million US
dollars).

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
said today that he was ready to agree on "the rules of the game"
in order to cooperate with Communist-dominated State Duma, the
lower house of the Russian Parliament, and urged Duma deputies
to follow suit.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Itar-Tass news agency, Yeltsin said he
was not going to "constantly pour forth criticisms against various
factions, the Duma itself, the Federation Council (the upper house
of the parliament)."
</P>
<P>
"A certain reciprocity is necessary from their side as well,"
he noted, adding that "if we fall out now, it will be a big blow
for the Russian state in general, for its prestige among our
people and in the world at large."
</P>
<P>
The president said that he had a telephone conversation with
Duma speaker Gennady Seleznyov, a leader of the Russian Communist
Party, earlier today and planned to discuss "the rules of the
game" at a meeting with him soon.
</P>
<P>
Seleznyov told reporters that he would hold his first meeting
with Yeltsin on Friday. But he refused to disclose what he was
planning to discuss with the president.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin said, "Our working relations are taking shape. We have
agreed to meet in two days."
</P>
<P>
"I believe we will agree on a mechanism for settling disputes
that may emerge. We shall get together and discuss those issues to
find a compromise and avoid confrontation," the president said,
stressing that the latter scenario should be completely ruled out.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin had earlier expressed his unhappiness with the
election of Seleznyov as Duma Speaker and made it clear he would
have preferred former speaker Ivan Rybkin to head the lower
chamber.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong, China Win Asian Cup Soccer Qualifiers  Opening Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong trounced the
Philippines 8-0 while China defeated Macao 7-1 in the first two
games of the Asian Cup Group Two soccer qualifying tournament here
this evening.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong led the Philippines 3-0 at halftime and China scored
three goals against one by Macao in their game's first half.
</P>
<P>
But the big margins in the scores of the games did not
necessarily mean easy victories, especially for China, the top
favorite of the four-team tournament.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese launched fierce attacks almost from the very
beginning of the game, which took place after hosts Hong Kong's
big-margined victory.
</P>
<P>
Superiorer on both personal skills and experience, the Chinese
side made a flying start, with five very threatening shots within
the first seven minutes. Macao's first shot came only after
eleven minutes into the game.
</P>
<P>
Peng Weiguo of China scored the opening goal at the 23rd
minute, when China was awarded with a penalty kick.
</P>
<P>
The Macao team, which decided Monday to rely on a solid,
passive defense in front of a much stronger Chinese side, was
encouraged by the fact that their opponents failed to score for so
long.
</P>
<P>
The Macao team switched into time-and-again offensives and, at
the 41st minute when Ung Siu Cheong scored with a sliding shot in
a goal-mouth melee. The teams were level at 1-1.
</P>
<P>
Angered by the surprise goal, the Chinese resorted to swift
attacks and scored two consecutive goals within the two following
minutes.
</P>
<P>
The game went Chinese way in the second half when the team
played a patient game and succeeded in breaking through the Macao
defense line from time to time. They scored four more goals to
bring about a 7-1 victory.
</P>
<P>
Qi Wusheng, the Chinese coach, admitted later that there was a
fluctuation in his players' game, especially in the first half.
"But fortunately the players got used to the slippery ground and
they improved their play right after," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The big-margin victory will encourage our players into the
following days," he added.
</P>
<P>
The four teams will have one day off tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the Philippines faces China and Hong Kong takes on
Macao.
</P>
<P>
The tournament ends on Sunday when Macao meets the Philippines
and China clashes with Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The team which wins the most games here comes out the group
winner and is qualified for the Asian Cup finals slated for
December this year in the United Arab Emirates.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Concerned with Aegean Sea Situation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 30 (Xinhua) -- The Cyprus government is
following with "great care" the developments in the Aegean Sea, a
government spokesman said here today.
</P>
<P>
Yiannakis Cassoulides, the spokesman, told a daily press
briefing a tension between Turkey and Greece in the Aegean Sea
is bound to affect Cyprus and that is why the whole affair is
followed closely with great care in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks when asked to comment on the dispute
between Turkey and greece, both of them NATO members, over an
island in the Aegean Sea, which is known as Imia.
</P>
<P>
Cassoulides declined to say whether the Cyprus' security
authorities are put on alert, but noted that Cyprus President
Glafcos Clerides is kept informed of the developments of the
situation.
</P>
<P>
The conflict began last week when the captain of a Turkish
ship that ran aground on the uninhabited island refused to let a
Greek tug assist it on grounds that the rocks belonged to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Greece summoned the Turkish ambassador after a
group of Turkish journalists landed on the island, took down a
Greek flag planted on it last week and hoisted the Turkish
flag.
</P>
<P>
Also Sunday, the Greek navy re-raised the Greek flag on the
outcrop between the Greek island of Kalymnos and the Turkish
coastal resort of Bodrum.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops invaded
and took control of 37 percent of the island's northern territory
following an Athens-backed coup. Greece and Turkey have been at
odds over Cyprus for many years.
</P>
<P>
Greece and Cyprus agreed in November 1993 to adopt a joint
defense pact to confront what they termed as Turkish threats.
</P>
<P>
Athens has warned Ankara that any Turkish military advance
towards the southern government-controlled part of this East
Mediterranean strategic island would mean war between the two
neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
Greece, Turkey and Britain were the three guarantors of
Cyprus' independence under the 1960 Treaty of establishment of
the Republic of Cyprus.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Auto Exports Continue to Shrink in 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Japan exported 3.79 million
automobiles in 1995, a 15 percent drop from 1994, the Japan
Automobile Manufacturers Association said today.
</P>
<P>
Auto exports have been falling for ten years in a row, the
association said.
</P>
<P>
Exports of cars and car parts totalled 81.6 billion
U.S. dollars last year, 2.9 percent less than in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The decline in exports is mainly due to the appreciation of the
Japanese yen, which has made Japanese car-makers less competitive
and forced them to shift production to overseas plants.
</P>
<P>
The association predicted that exports will continue to drop
this year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Japanese Transport Ministry said Monday that
Japan had 70 million automobiles by November 1995, which means
there are two cars for every three Japanese families.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan Prime Minister
Benazir Bhutto performed the ground breaking ceremony today,
heralding construction of two power plants at Keti Bandar town,
some 150 kilometers from Pakistan's southern port city of Karachi.
</P>
<P>
The two power generation units of 660 MW each are being
constructed by Hong Kong's Consolidated Electric Power Asia
(CEPA), a subsidiary of Hong Kong billionaire Gordon Wu's Hopewell
Holdings.
</P>
<P>
This is the first two units of the eight power generation units
with a 5,280 MW ultimate capacity, which would be completed in
four phases at a cost of six billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The CEPA, with 15 years' experience in power generation, had
installed power plants in China and the Philippines before.
</P>
<P>
Wu and Project Director Stewart W. G. Elliott presented salient
features of the project and master plan of the future port city
before Benazir Bhutto.
</P>
<P>
CEPA Chairman Gordon Wu, described it as a great occasion, said
that the Keti Bandar project would mark a new era in Pakistan's
development.
</P>
<P>
He said that the government's energy policy will help improve
the standard of living of the people in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Stewart Elliott said that the CEPA would invest about 1.5
billion to 2 billion US dollars on the two power generating units.
</P>
<P>
He said after the signing of Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)
some one and a half year ago, the Sindh government gave 10 sites
for establishment of power stations, and the site of Keti Bandar
was selected because of its harbor and land.
</P>
<P>
He said the power plants would run on imported coal, while six
other units of the same capacity would be energized on local coal.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after performing the ground-breaking ceremony of the
project, Benazir said that more than 25,000 people would get jobs
with the completion of the power station and a port at Keti Bandar
in Thatta district of Sindh Province.

<HEADLINE> "Closure of CD salons Causes No Social Disturbance" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 30 (Xinhua) -- The closure of 5,000 compact
disk (CD) salons nationwide has so far caused no social
disturbance, a senior official said here today.
</P>
<P>
"Most managers said that they agreed with the government's
decision, and I have so far heard of no confrontations between the
law enforcers and the managers," said Wang Wenyuan, deputy
director of the Administrative Bureau for Cultural Markets of the
Culture Ministry.
</P>
<P>
"They closed the salons voluntarily to follow the government's
order," said the official, who is responsible for the crackdown
launched at the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
About 95 percent of the 5,000 salons have been closed and the
ministry is urging cities to close the rest within a definite
period of time, he added.
</P>
<P>
An investigation launched by Xinhua correspondents earlier this
month backed up Wang's statement. The manager of a CD salon in the
coastal province of Fujian told a reporter: "I closed my salon
immediately after I read about the government notice and realized
that what I was doing was illegal".
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government maintained that the commercial showing
of CDs infringed international copyrights.
</P>
<P>
The government first banned the commercial showing of CDs in
1990. But this time it adopted tougher measures.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that the closure has resulted in a great loss of
money and the re-arrangement of the staff members of the salons.
</P>
<P>
Xinhua's investigation has found that most salons were run by
state-owned cinemas and the workers are still attached to the
cinemas. They might be given new jobs by the cinema managers.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that the crackdown was carried out smoothly, thanks
greatly to local government and media support.
</P>
<P>
"At the beginning, some people could not understand the
decision. But after they heard the explanation of the government
and the press, they realized the necessity of anti-piracy
steps. The crackdown itself taught a legal lesson to all the
people and will have a lasting influence on copyright protection,"
Wang said.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that the move will not affect greatly
people's recreational activities, as there are still 4,000 cinemas
and many similar facilities in the country.
</P>
<P>
Sources at the China Film Export and Import Corporation said
that the annual import of 10 first-rate foreign films will benefit
from the closure.

<HEADLINE> MOFTEC Spokesman On China's IPR Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Problems concerning copyrights
should not block the development of Sino-US and Sino-European ties.
</P>
<P>
This remark was made here today by Hu Zhaoqing, spokesman for
the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation (MOFTEC),
at a press conference while answering a question about
intellectual property rights (IPR) protection in China.
</P>
<P>
China always attaches great importance to IPR protection, and
had made significant achievement in this regard by furthering
legislation and law enforcement, Hu said.
</P>
<P>
It is a common knowledge that some problems will inevitably
crop up in the process of a country's development, and it takes
time to solve such problems, Hu said. So, he added, China does not
agree to some countries' acts of criticizing China or even
overstating the flaws in IPR protection in China.
</P>
<P>
He noted that China's resolve to protect IPR and crack down
upon piracy will not change.
</P>
<P>
Since China attaches great importance to its relations with the
United States and European Union, the Chinese side would not like
to see some temporary problems obstruct the development of the
bilateral ties, he said.

<P>
BANGKOK, January 30 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government today
approved two draft regulations proposed by the Finance Ministry on
cutting tariffs on 5,524 products, a government press release said
today.
</P>
<P>
The two regulations were approved at a cabinet meeting to

<P>
In the category of unprocessed agricultural products, tariffs
on 521 items will be lowered, including live animals, animal
products, crop products, tobacco, rubber and raw leather.

<HEADLINE> Report Shows Decline In World Jewish Population </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Despite the ever-increasing
growth of Israel, World Jewry is becoming an "endangered species",
local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post, quoting a study released by the World
Jewish Congress, said that Jews are "a people in a crisis of
spirit of identity," because they are losing their identity
through intermarriage and cultural assimilation.
</P>
<P>
There are 13 million Jews in the world, with North America
being inhabited by the largest Jewish population of 6.6 million
and Libya the smallest by only five Jews.
</P>
<P>
"Demographically the Jewish people has never recovered from the
Holocaust," said Avi Beker, editor of the study.
</P>
<P>
Israel is the only country in the world where the Jewish
population is increasingly independent of immigration. In Canada,
Germany, Panama and Hong Kong, the number of Jews is increasing
because of immigration.
</P>
<P>
Canada's Jewish's community grew some 50 percent in the last
three decades. Germany's population has doubled to 60,000 in the
last 20 years.
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, the Jewish population is shrinking. The New
York region, with 1.75 million Jews, has the largest Jewish
population of any metropolitan area in the world, outside
Israel. Miami has 535,000 Jews and Los Angeles 490,000.
</P>
<P>
The Jewish populations of the successor states to the Soviet
Union appear to be higher than previously thought, the study
said, with more than 40 percent of world's school-age children.
</P>
<P>
More than a half-million Israelis have emigrated since 1948,
primarily to the U.S. (375,000), Canada (40,000), France (40,000),
the U.K. (30,000) and South Africa (10,000).
</P>
<P>
Most of the Diaspora's one million Orthodox Jews are in
the U.S., according to the study.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 30 (Xinhua) -- U.S. retail sales rose just
0.3 percent in December despite holiday shopping season, the
Commerce Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report said that retail sales totaled a seasonally adjusted
198.6 billion dollars in December, up from 198 billion dollars a
month earlier.
</P>
<P>
The December activity boosted retail sales for the year to 2.3
trillion dollars, 4.9 percent above those of 1994.
</P>
<P>
It was the smallest gain since a 0.6 percent advance in 1991 as
the last recession was ending.
</P>
<P>
Retail sales represent about one-half of consumer spending, and
the December holiday shopping can account for as much as one-half
of a retailer's yearly profits.
</P>
<P>
The report was released as Federal Reserve policy makers
prepared to open a two-day meeting to consider whether to cut
short-term interest rates for a third time in seven months to
stimulate the economy.

<HEADLINE> China's Foreign Economic Assistance, Contract Service Boom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 30 (Xinhua) -- China's reform of the ways of
granting foreign economic assistance last year has resulted in
great success.
</P>
<P>
China adopted the measure of combining governmental
interest-subsidized loans with bank's commercial loans in efforts
to promote establishment of equity and contractual joint ventures
by Chinese businesses and their counterparts in the recipient
countries of foreign economic aid.
</P>
<P>
In 1995 China signed framework agreements on governmental
interest-subsidized loans with 11 recipient countries. Nearly 20
projects in the form of equity and contractual joint ventures were
implemented and 58 projects for complete plants were undertaken by
China for 26 countries. China also took part in multilateral
assistance for 51 countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
The focus of China's foreign economic assistance has been
placed on the small and medium-sized production projects which are
locally needed and can be supported by local resources of the
recipient countries, according to Hu Zhaoqing, spokesman of the
Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Co-operation (MOFTEC).
</P>
<P>
In another development, the first 11 months of last year
witnessed great growth in China's overseas project contracting and
labor co-operation.
</P>
<P>
Almost 18,000 project contracts with a total value of over
seven billion US dollars were signed, an increase of nearly 20
percent over the same period of the previous year. A total of 5.3
billion US dollars was realized in business turnover, 10 percent
more than in the same period of the previous year. At the end of
November over 280,000 Chinese people were working abroad, an
increase of more than 60,000 over the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Hu pointed out that Asia is still China's main market for
overseas projects and labor co-operation, and China's contract
numbers and business turnover in Asia are respectively 70 percent
of the total figures. Meanwhile, its project contracts and labor
co-operation in Africa have also developed steadily.

<HEADLINE> Abductors Resume Contact with Indonesian Military </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 30 (Xinhua) -- The abductors of the Free Papua
Movement (OPM), which continue to hold 13 hostages in Irian Jaya,
resumed contact with the Indonesian Armed Forces (ABRI) today.
</P>
<P>
The OPM cut off its contact with the ABRI since last Friday.
</P>
<P>
An OPM member contacted the military through a radio asking the
ABRI not to take any military measure in rescuing the hostages,
according to an Antara report today from Wamena, Irian Jaya.
</P>
<P>
The OPM abductors kidnapped 26 people including seven
foreigners on January 8. Later 13 hostages including one
foreigner were released.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the kidnappers voiced their demands for food and
medicines through radio contacts with the military and agreed to
talks with some missionaries as mediators.
</P>
<P>
Later, the OPM cut off contacts with the military following a
plan to take the remaining hostages out of the hideout.
</P>
<P>
Commander of the Jayawijaya military district Lt. Col. Sumertha
Ayub was quoted by Antara as saying that the ABRI is still
determined to use a persuasive approach in its attempts to free
the hostages.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, another report from Jayapura, capital of Irian Jaya,
said that the two Indonesian students abducted by the OPM on
November 22, 1995, were freed by the kidnappers Monday.

<HEADLINE> "China's New Import Tariff Policy Won't Dampen Capital Inflow" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 30 (Xinhua) -- China's adjustment of its
import tariff policy will not affect its foreign capital inflow, a
spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic
Co-operation said here today.
</P>
<P>
In response to a question at a press conference, the spokesman,
Hu Zhaoqing, described the move as a major step toward deeper
reform and broader opening.
</P>
<P>
China announced the abolishment of the preferential policy on
import tariff for foreign-funded enterprises at the end of last
year and the policy will go into effect as of April 1 this year.
</P>
<P>
Hu said that although it will take some time for foreign
investors to adapt to the adjustment, the general trend for
China's foreign investment will remain good and unaffected.
</P>
<P>
To ensure smooth transition, the spokesman noted, the Chinese
government has taken into consideration the specific conditions of
foreign-funded enterprises, including those to be established soon.
</P>
<P>
He said that a three-month transitional period is given from
the time of the announcement to the actual implementation of the
policy so that those foreign-funded enterprises to be set up
during the transitional period can get enough time to go through
the approval procedures.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, foreign-invested enterprises established before the
announcement of the policy will be given a grace period of one to
two years during which their imported equipment can still enjoy
tax exemption or reduction.
</P>
<P>
Hu expressed the conviction that with the establishment and
improvement of the socialist market economy, China's overall
investment environment will be further upgraded and all foreign
investors seeking long-term development in China will make
profits.

<HEADLINE> Saudi Minister Calls for Bigger Role of Private Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia's new Finance
Minister Ibrahim Bin Abdel-Aziz al-Assaf today urged the country's
private sector to pay a bigger role in bolstering the national
economy.
</P>
<P>
According to reports reaching here from Riyadh, Assaf said that
he assumed the post of finance minister at a time when all
elements were available for a continuation of economic growth and
financial stability in the desert but oil-rich kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Assaf, who was appointed by King Fahd Monday, was quoted as
telling the official Saudi Press Agency that the economic
environment in Saudi Arabia was favorable because it boasts a
strong and modern infrastructure, economic openness and free flow
of trade and transfers.
</P>
<P>
Assaf, 47, replaced Suleiman Bin Abdel-Aziz al-Sulaim, who had
resigned for a heart problem.
</P>
<P>
The new minister, who had served as deputy governor of the
Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency, is expected to follow the economic
policies set in Saudi Arabia's sixth five-year economic plan
approved last July. The plan covers years up to 2000.
</P>
<P>
The plan aims to reduce the kingdom's dependence on oil and
encourage a greater part for the private sector.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Pakistan Auto Parts Industry Booms (by Wang Hongyu) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 30 (Xinhua) -- The indigenous vendor
industry in Pakistan provides 84 percent of the total parts used
in tractor manufacturing and 28 to 50 percent in auto industry,
said Rana Abdul Qadir, chairman of the Pakistan Auto Parts
Association.
</P>
<P>
However, "the auto parts industry in Pakistan was very small at
the beginning, only a few items were produced for automobiles in
1940s and they were not commercialized," he recalled.
</P>
<P>
Figures released by the Export Promotion Bureau showed that
Pakistan's auto parts are being exported to America, Japan, Sri
Lanka, Australia, Europe and Gulf states, earning 4.52 million US
dollars in 1994-95 as against 4.22 million dollars in 1993-94.
</P>
<P>
At present, there are ten big joint ventures in Pakistan's auto
industry, mostly in collaboration with Japan, followed by South
Korea, Italy, Britain and Russia. South Korea companies are
planning to set up more plants in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
"We have more than 300 recognized manufacturers, meanwhile,
there is a cottage industry in auto parts manufacturing, the total
auto parts manufacturers are around 2,000," said Qadir.
</P>
<P>
However, "we are facing problems of high inputs, especially
high cost of electricity, and there are lot of custom duties on
the raw material imported for auto parts manufacturing," Qadir
said.
</P>
<P>
"Despite all these problems, we are improving slowly, and if
everything is fine and we have good markets abroad, I think the
auto parts industry can shoot up very fast," he noted.

<HEADLINE> Non-Governmental Foreign Economic, Trade Ties Advance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 30 (Xinhua) -- China's booming
non-governmental economic and trade activities in 1995 have
greatly stimulated the entry of Chinese enterprises into the
international market and foreign enterprises into China.
</P>
<P>
Guo Dongpo, president of the China Council for the Promotion of
International Trade (CCPIT), revealed this in an interview with
Xinhua here today.
</P>
<P>
According to him, five delegations of entrepreneurs dispatched
by the CCPIT visited a dozen countries of Europe, Asia and North
America last year along with state leaders. Meanwhile, it received
over 30 similar foreign delegations.
</P>
<P>
The CCPIT also sent delegations to South Africa, Paraguay,
Dominica and other countries which have no diplomatic relations
with China, and conducted broad exchanges with the political,
economic, industrial and commercial circles of those countries,
with agreements reached on personnel and information exchanges,
and the holding of exhibitions, etc.
</P>
<P>
Since July 1994 the CCPIT has received nearly 2,000 foreign
delegations and dispatched some 500 abroad with the number of
Chinese enterprises involved reaching 4,000.
</P>
<P>
The CCPIT has tended to pay more attention to the central and
western parts of China and the state-run medium and
small-enterprises with a view to help them know better about the
international market and seek for co-operations, Guo noted.
</P>
<P>
Last year, nearly 5,000 Chinese enterprises held exhibitions
abroad and some 20,000 foreign enterprises displayed their
products in China, all with the help of the CCPIT.
</P>
<P>
Guo pointed out that foreign arbitration, mediation and
trademark agency services carried out by the CCPIT have helped to
improve China's investment climate, as well as Sino-foreign
economic, trade and technological co-operation.
</P>
<P>
In 1995 the international economic and trade arbitration
committee which is affiliated with the CCPIT, accepted more than
900 economic and trade mediation cases and 20 maritime mediation
cases, winding up 800 and 16, respectively. Patent and trademark
application cases the CCPIT accepted last year exceeded 5,000 and
8,000, respectively.

KATHMANDU, January 30 (Xinhua) -- The Nepali government is
doing its best to open rural development banks in all the villages
throughout the country, Finance Minister Ram Sharan Mahat said
here today.
</P>
<P>
Such financial institutions have been helping make Nepalese
rural women economically self-reliant by providing them loans for
their economic activities at low interest rates, Mahat said at a

A provision has made by the government for penalizing joint

money received from the penalty would be given to rural banks,
said the finance minister.
</P>
<P>
The one-day seminar, organized by the Nepalese Federation of
Business and Professional Women, was aimed at informing the world
about the economic activities of Nepalese women and increasing
these activities through coordination and discussions among women
from different countries.

<HEADLINE> Many Young Britons Unemployable: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Excessive focus on academic
qualifications at the expense of "life skills" is leaving many
British young people unemployable, it was reported here today.
</P>
<P>
Schools are failing to prepare pupils for the "responsibilities
and experiences of adult life," the Industry in Education study
said, adding that schools should teach children how to develop
self-motivation and character instead of simply concentrating on
exams.
</P>
<P>
"Employers are saying to us that young people are not
employable," said Dick Whitcutt, director of Industry in
Education, which represents 30 firms, including the Midland Bank,
Norwich Union, Sony, Tesco, Guinness, Barclays and Dixons.
</P>
<P>
The report, titled Towards Employability, found that while a
keen candidate could easily pick up skills on the job, qualities
such as consideration and self-expression were far harder to
develop.
</P>
<P>
A steering group led by Sir John Smith, former Deputy
Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, investigated the
attitudes of employers and young people.
</P>
<P>
The study found that even among those with academic
qualifications, many were unable to write intelligible letters or
do basic calculations.
</P>
<P>
According to another survey conducted by the government-funded
Basic Skills Agency, young Britons today have more difficulty with
spelling than did young people 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The agency put the blame chiefly on teaching methods in British
primary schools which were heavily criticized last week after
national tests showed that half of all 11-year-olds were not
reaching minimal standards in reading, writing and mathematics.

<HEADLINE> UEFA to Discuss Bosman Court Ruling With EU Commission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Representatives of UEFA will
meet the European Commission on Thursday to further discuss the
controversial Bosman court ruling, a Commission spokeswoman said
here at a news briefing on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The European Court of Justice ruled on December 15 in a case
brought by Belgian footballer Jean-Marc Bosman that UEFA's
transfer system and player-nationality restrictions were illegal.
</P>
<P>
UEFA general secretary Gerhard Aigner had asked in a letter
earlier this month to meet European Union Social Affairs
Commissioner Padraig Flynn and Competition Commissioner Karel Van
Miert to hold talks on the ruling.
</P>
<P>
Van Miert earlier told a Spanish newspaper that the Commission
found it is hopeless to persuade UEFA to end its transfer system.
</P>
<P>
"We've been negotiating with UEFA for 15 years but
unfortunately they have always turned a deaf ear," Van Miert said.
</P>
<P>
There are only six weeks to go before the deadline in the
ruling when UEFA must end its transfer fee system and nationality
restrictions or face possible fines.
</P>
<P>
The Commission has the authority to fine those violating
competition rules up to 10 percent of their annual turnover.
</P>
<P>
Among the UEFA delegation include David Will of Scotland,
vice-president of the world soccer governing body FIFA and
chairman of UEFA's European Community committee, the former head
of the French Football Federation Jean Fournet-Fayard, and UEFA's
legal counsel in Brussels, Alastair Bell.

<HEADLINE> Chinese, Ugandan Presidents Confer in Beijing (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Extending his appreciation for the Ugandan government's support
for the Chinese government in many international arenas, Jiang
said that China and Uganda, two developing countries, share the
same or similar views on many issues including democracy and human
rights.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that China holds that today's world is
diversified and a certain kind of social mode should not be
imposed on peoples of all countries.
</P>
<P>
For developing countries, Jiang noted, the rights to
subsistence and development are the greatest human rights of all.
</P>
<P>
After years of war, the Ugandan government has made great
efforts for developing its national economy and raising its
people's living standards, which, in Jiang's words, is the most
practical way to protect human rights.
</P>
<P>
Saying that both China and Uganda firmly oppose the practice of
interfering in developing countries' internal affairs in the name
of protecting democracy and human rights, Jiang expressed his hope
for closer co-operation with Uganda in the field of human rights.
</P>
<P>
Expressing his agreement with Jiang, Museveni said that Uganda,
a pre-industrialized society, can only adopt a democratic mode in
accordance with its own characteristics, while not copying that
from industrialized countries.
</P>
<P>
He also spoke highly of China's stand in its opposition to any
interference in other's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
On African affairs, Museveni said that since the South Africa
issue was resolved, African affairs have been turning for the
better and Africa is moving forward.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that the impact on Africa brought about by the
drastic changes in international situations in the past few years
has been relaxed and the African political situations are moving
towards peace, while co-operation among African countries has been
strengthened, which has resulted in economic development in a
number of African countries.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that the unity and co-operation among African
countries are the greatest benefit to the African people. He added
that he hoped that African countries could concentrate on economic
construction while resolving various disputes, in a bid to create
a peaceful and stable environment.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that the Chinese government and people have all
along been supporting the striving of the African countries and
people for national independence, sovereignty and economic
development.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Chinese government and people are willing to
further co-operate with African countries under the new
international situations.
</P>
<P>
Museveni invited Jiang to visit Uganda, and Jiang expressed his
thanks for the invitation.
</P>
<P>
After the talks the two presidents attended the signing
ceremony for an economic and technological co-operation agreement
between the two governments. Then Jiang hosted a dinner for the
Ugandan visitors.
</P>
<P>
Before the talks Jiang presided over a welcoming ceremony for
Museveni and accompanied him in reviewing a guard of honor
composed of the three services of the Chinese People's Liberation
Army.

<HEADLINE> One-China Principle -- Basis for Reunification (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 30 (Xinhua) -- The one-China principle is the
basis and premise for achieving the peaceful reunification of the
motherland and safeguarding China's national sovereignty and
territorial integrity, an editorial to be carried in tomorrow's
"People's Daily" says.
</P>
<P>
The editorial is released exactly one year after Chinese
President and General Secretary of the Communist Party of China
(CPC) Jiang Zemin put forward eight propositions in a speech
titled "Continue to Promote the Reunification of the Motherland".
</P>
<P>
Jiang's speech was aimed at safeguarding the fundamental
interests of all Chinese people on both sides of the Taiwan
Straits. It showed the unshakable principle and determination to
reunify the motherland, and put forward practical and effective
suggestions and measures to achieve reunification, according to
the editorial.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the speech gained high appreciation and firm support
from all Chinese at home and abroad, including the Taiwan
compatriots. Those who have good insight and support reunification
expect a new situation to emerge regarding the relations between
the two sides on the basis of Jiang's eight propositions.
</P>
<P>
"Whether the one-China principle is to be adhered to is the
focus of our contention with the Taiwan authorities. Facts show
that the Taiwan authorities have run counter to this principle,"
the editorial says.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after Jiang made the speech, Lee Teng-hui, having made
no due response, went abroad and acted as a card for certain
anti-china forces. He wantonly engaged in activities attempting to
create "two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan". His activities
sabotaged the development of relations across the Taiwan Straits,
and directly harmed the fundamental interests of people on both
sides, especially those of the Taiwan compatriots.
</P>
<P>
"Now people have seen clearly that the tense situation in the
relations between the two sides last year were caused by the
Taiwan authorities single-handedly," the editorial says.
</P>
<P>
One year after Jiang made the speech, Chinese Premier Li Peng
reiterated the consistent stand of the Chinese Communist Party and
the Chinese government on the reunification question.
</P>
<P>
"There is only one China in the world, and Taiwan is an
inalienable part of China. No matter how the ways of producing
Taiwan's leaders change, the fact that Taiwan is part of China's
territory can not be changed, nor can the fact that Taiwan's
leaders are only leaders of one region of China," the editorial
quotes Li as saying.
</P>
<P>
This is a principled stand and solemn declaration made by the
Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese government, allowing no
mistaking what the declaration is aimed at.
</P>
<P>
Although Lee Teng-hui is trying to cloak his splittist
activities with "democracy", his real aim is to turn Taiwan into a
"political entity" independent of China, or to create "two Chinas"
or "one China, one Taiwan" in the international community, the
editorial points out.
</P>
<P>
"Taiwan's position as one part of China has never changed, and
will never be allowed to change. Any such attempt is futile, and
the Chinese government and people will never allow it," the
editorial goes on.

<TEXT>
<P>
"The historical course of reunifying the motherland is
irresistible, and the continuously developing relations between
the two sides of the Taiwan Straits is in accordance with the
general trend and the will of the people," the editorial says.
</P>
<P>
"In spite of the heavy-handed interference of the Taiwan
authorities over the past year, fairly great progress has been
made in people-to-people exchanges and economic co-operation
between the two sides," it points out. "Facts have demonstrated
that the development of the relations between the two sides is in
the basic interests of all the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
"The people living on both sides of the straits are Chinese,
having the same roots and sharing weal and woe," it says. "Anyone
who dares to take the risk of attempting to split the motherland
for his selfish interests runs counter to the common interests of
the people on both sides of the Taiwan Straits and is doomed to
failure."
</P>
<P>
The editorial continues that In 1997 and 1999 the Chinese
government will resume the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong
and Macao, respectively, and then solution to the Taiwan question
-- for the completion of the historical mission of reunifying
China -- will emerge as more outstandingly important than ever
before to all the Chinese people," the editorial says.
</P>
<P>
It stresses that "we will continue to adhere to the basic
principle of "peaceful reunification, and one country, two
systems", continue the economic exchanges and co-operation across
the Taiwan Straits, and promote direct exchanges of mail service,
trade and shipping to create better conditions for the
reunification of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
"Meanwhile, we will never pledge not to use force, which will
not be directed at the people of Taiwan but at intervening foreign
forces and forces working for 'Taiwan independence'," it says.
</P>
<P>
"It is not possible to accomplish the reunification overnight,
but it cannot be postponed indefinitely either," the editorial
says.
</P>
<P>
It stresses that the activities aimed at splitting the
motherland by a handful of people and the advocacy of "Taiwan
independence" are absolutely impermissible.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan authorities must stop trying to create "two Chinas"
or "one China, one Taiwan" in the international community and come
back to the stand of the principle of "one China", not only in
words but in action, it says. With this, the relations between the
two sides of the Taiwan Straits will develop normally.

<HEADLINE> Israel Launches Air Raids on Guerrilla Bases in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, January 30 (Xinhua) -- In the first air raids against
south Lebanon since the beginning of this year, Israeli warplanes
today launched a series of attacks on guerrilla bases of the
pro-Iranian Hezbollah or Party of God in Iglim Al-Toffah.
</P>
<P>
Security sources said that two Israeli fighter-bombers,
covered by four other warplanes, launched three air raids at
Jebal Ar-Rafiah, and in each of the raids the fighters fired
two air-to-surface missiles at targeted positions of Hezbollah's
Shiite guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
At 2:00 p.m. (12:00 GMT), Israeli warplanes rushed back and
fired four missiles at Ain Buswar and Jebal Safi in the
same area.
</P>
<P>
No casualties in the successive attacks have been reported
by the security sources.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah announced that its positions in Iglim Al-Toffah
were attacked around 12:45 p.m. by four Israeli jet fighters.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian-backed organization added in a statement that its
guerrillas fired back by launching several Sam-7 anti-air
missiles at the Israeli warplanes, forcing the enemy's planes
to escape.
</P>
<P>
Iglim Al-Toffah, or Province of Apple, is a ridge often
used by Lebanese Moslem militants as a spring board to
launch attacks on Israeli forces and their client militia, the
South Lebanon Army, in Israel's self-proclaimed "security
zone" in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Local military experts believe that today's air raids were
retaliating for a suicide bombing targeted at a SLA post in
Marjayoun area in the central sector of the buffer zone Sunday
night.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here the south quoted SLA sources in
Marjayoun city, where SLA headquarters is located, as saying
that two persons in a white Mercedes 230 died immediately
after a blast ripped it apart.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that the two unidentified men parked the
car, around 5:00 p.m., 200 meters away from a post of the
SLA militia, which assists some 1,000 Israeli troops in
patrolling the bordering buffer enclave in Markab town.
</P>
<P>
Coordinator for the Israeli activities in south Lebanon Ury
Lubrani accused Hezbollah of being behind the car-bomb explosion.
</P>
<P>
Consequently, the Israeli forces threw a blockade at Beni Hayan
village in Bint Jbail area in the Israeli occupied strip
and arrested the owner of the car, which was used in the bomb attack.
</P>
<P>
Ahmad Jaber, the owner, claimed that five armed men broke into
his house at Sunday afternoon, locked him in the house, loaded
explosives in his car and drove away, according to the SLA
sources.

ZAGREB, January 29 (Xinhua) -- The International Committee of
Red Cross (ICRC) said today that Bosnian factions have still held
112 prisoners of war, despite release of more than 400 pows in the
past two days.
</P>
<P>
Beat Schweitzer, head of the ICRC mission in Bosnia, said in
Sarajevo that the 112 pows were held on charges of war crimes.
</P>
<P>
He called on the three sides in Bosnia to submit evidence to
The Hague Tribunal, so that the Tribunal could decide whether
there was any basis for prosecution of the detained persons.
</P>
<P>
Schweitzer said that ICRC representatives were still denied
access to the military prison in Tuzla where the Red Cross
suspected that several dozens of Bosnian Serb soldiers who had
been taken prisoner in last year's fighting on Mt Ozren were being
held in the prison.
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the Dayton peace agreement, all prisoners of
war must be released before January 19. enditem

<HEADLINE> Chinese, Ugandan Presidents Confer in Beijing (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
expressed the conviction here today that through concerted efforts
co-operation between China and Uganda can be reinforced.
</P>
<P>
During talks with visiting Ugandan President Yoweri Kaguta
Museveni, Jiang said that China has always stressed its relations
with Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Jiang noted that the two countries have maintained traditional
friendship, and since the establishment of Sino-Ugandan diplomatic
ties 33 years ago the co-operation between the two countries in
the fields of politics, economy, national defence and culture have
witnessed smooth development.
</P>
<P>
"We are grateful to President Museveni and the Ugandan
government for the importance they attach to the friendship
between the two nations," Jiang noted.
</P>
<P>
He continued that in recent years Sino-Ugandan economic and
technological co-operation has improved, with positive results.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that China attaches much importance to developing
its trade and economic links with Uganda and is willing to make
concerted efforts with Uganda in exploring new ways and areas for
further co-operation in a bid to push bilateral trade and economic
co-operation to a new high.
</P>
<P>
The president said that since it is improving its investment
climate, Uganda will become more and more attractive to foreign
investors, and the Chinese government encourages and supports in a
positive way Chinese enterprises to invest and start businesses in
Uganda.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that he believed more contacts and exchanges between
the two countries' enterprises will produce more achievements.
</P>
<P>
Museveni said that the Ugandan government and people greatly
appreciate the long-term and staunch support of the Chinese
government and people for the just cause of Uganda, and China's
contribution to the African people's efforts in anti-colonialism
and national economic development.
</P>
<P>
He welcomed Chinese businesses to invest and conduct economic
activities in Uganda, which enjoys great advantages in producing
coffee, cotton and tropical crops.
</P>
<P>
The president said that the Ugandan government strictly
observes the one-China policy and it will not have official ties
with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, expressing his appreciation for Uganda's stand, said
that the issue of Taiwan involves China's sovereignty, territorial
integrity, and the Chinese people's national feelings.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Taiwan authorities' stand of trying to split
the motherland and attempting to create "two Chinas" or "one
China, one Taiwan" is against the will and interests of all the
Chinese people, including those residing in Taiwan, and therefore
is unpopular.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that China strongly opposes the efforts of certain
foreign forces who attempt to use the issue of Taiwan to interfere
in China's internal affairs and check China's development and
reunification.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Pakistan Bank's Privatization in Trouble (by Gong Min) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Although it tried very hard,
Pakistan is still unable to meet the deadline set by the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) for privatizing the country's
second largest commercial bank, the United Bank Limited (UBL).
</P>
<P>
The final bidding for the UBL was put off for the third time
when the two bidders, Faysal Bank of Bahrain and Saudi
Basharahill, failed to show up in Pakistan's Privatization
Commission (PC) Monday.
</P>
<P>
The IMF asked the Pakistani government to privatize the UBL
before January 31.
</P>
<P>
The bidding date was first set on January 8, then postponed to
January 23, and again on January 29. The PC now decided to put
off the bidding till February 14.
</P>
<P>
Both bidders earlier requested more time to study the situation
of the UBL and determine the bad debts of the bank.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan has earlier privatized the Muslim Commercial Bank and
the Allied Bank of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
After the privatization of the UBL, the Habib Bank Limited, the
largest bank in Pakistan, will also be privatized.
</P>
<P>
The UBL's declared assets were 5.2 billion US dollars and
deposits 3.01 billion dollars. It has more than 1,600 branches in
the country and 25 branches abroad.
</P>
<P>
According to the privatization plan, at the first stage, 26
percent of the bank's shares will be sold to the highest bidder
with the transfer of the management to the bidder.
</P>
<P>
Another 25 percent of the shares will be offered to buyers at
the second stage.
</P>
<P>
Under the package signed with the UBL employees union in
January, 20 percent of the bank's shares will be purchased by its
22,000 employees.
</P>
<P>
The two bidders, both from the Middle East, were short-listed
for final bidding of the 26 percent of the UBL shares from eight
firms interested in the bank.
</P>
<P>
However, Faysal Bank of Bahrain and the PC differed with each
other on the bad loans of the UBL.
</P>
<P>
The PC put the figure at 16 billion rupees (467 million
dollars) while Faysal Bank's estimate is much higher.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, Faysal Bank requested the Pakistani government to
deposit 20 billion rupees (584 million dollars) with the UBL for a
period of five years after its privatization.
</P>
<P>
Faysal Bank indicated it might withdraw if its demand was not
met.
</P>
<P>
However, the PC termed the demand as "unrealistic," saying that
"we are not in the position to do that."
</P>
<P>
The government of Pakistan has met criticism as it is worried
that there would be only one bidder left and lack of competition
would lead to the loss of national assets.
</P>
<P>
The government was also criticized for not allowing local
companies to bid for the bank.
</P>
<P>
However, the government is determined to go ahead with the
privatization process and hopes to get a good price for the UBL.

<HEADLINE> Fire Destroys Venice Opera House </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Venice's world-famous opera house
La Fenice was reduced to a smouldering ruin by a fire Monday night.
</P>
<P>
The opera house, which had a 204-year history, collapsed as
flames roared through its roof.
</P>
<P>
Firefighters arrived on the scene soon after a police patrol
reported seeing smoke from the building shortly after 9:00
p.m. But the fire, fanned by a stiff wind, had spread too fast to
be put out quickly by the firemen.
</P>
<P>
The blaze, which lasted more than three hours, destroyed the
building which was regarded as one of Italy's greatest artistic
institutions, with damage estimated at some 500 billion lire (314
million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The cause of the fire is still under investigation. Reports
said that the blaze was probably caused by a fire-fighting system
improperly installed in the building.
</P>
<P>
La Fenice, opened in 1792 and rebuilt after burning to the
ground in 1836, has been closed for restoration since last August.
</P>
<P>
Fenice means "phoenix," a mythological bird which burned itself
on a pyre and then rose from the ashes to live again.

MACAO, January 30 (Xinhua) -- The number of crime cases in
Macao reached 7,181 last year, registering an increase of 20.36
percent over the previous year, a local security officer announced
 today.
</P>
<P>
The increase of crime cases focuses on holding fake
credentials, drug dealing, robbery, stealing, body injury and
blackmailing, said Oscar Gomes da Silva, secretary-general of the
Macao Security Coordination Office.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the number of detained illegal immigrants
grew to 6,594, a rise of 25 percent over the previous year.

However, he said that the number of severe crime cases like
murder and robbery in banks, pawn shops, casinos and gold shops
have dropped compared with that in 1994.

The officer said that Macao security departments have held a
special meeting to enhance security measures. The police have
offered safety advises to local citizens and they will strengthen
police forces to fight against crimes.

In addition, they will ask for security departments of China's
mainland to help fight crimes.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Official Urges Agricultural Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 30 (Xinhua) -- A high-ranking Chinese official
today called on agricultural departments at all levels to do their
best to ensure good harvests this year.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Premier Jiang Chunyun said this at All-China Agricultural
Working Conference which opened here today.
</P>
<P>
Good harvests will be of great importance this year, as this is
the first year of the Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000), Jiang told
the conference sponsored by the Ministry of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
To ensure good harvests, Jiang urged agricultural departments
at all levels to protect farmers' enthusiasm for farming, noting
that with enthusiasm, farmers will input more into agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Naming the spread of advanced agricultural technology as one of
the key measures for good harvests, Jiang urged that a
breakthrough be made in this field this year.
</P>
<P>
According to him, spreading 10 farming techniques will be
listed high on this year's agricultural agenda.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Jiang said, to ensure good harvests, the supply of
seeds, chemical fertilizers, farm-use plastic sheeting and other
agricultural means of production must be guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
He also mentioned other measures such as doing a good job in
the fight against natural disasters and bringing the development
of township enterprises into full play.
</P>
<P>
also at the conference today, the ministry commended 200
counties and 10 reclamation areas for their great contributions to
last year's agricultural development.

<HEADLINE> Egypt to Use Natural Gas-Fueled Buses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Natural gas-fueled buses will be
put into operation for the first time in Egypt in March as part of
the government's efforts to reduce air pollution in Cairo.
</P>
<P>
The country's sole English-language daily, the Egyptian
Gazette, today quoted Board Chairman of the Public Transport
Authority Nabil Mazin as saying that the first stage of the plan
for buses to operate with natural gas is being implemented.
</P>
<P>
He said that 100 new buses will be added to the gas-fueled bus
contingent every year to further reduce air pollution, which is
quite severe in the Egyptian capital.
</P>
<P>
Another measure to lessen the fumes emitted by buses is to
replace worn-out parts of the vehicles every six years, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
He said that a total of 16,000 buses run on different lines
in Cairo and its suburbs.
</P>
<P>
Most of them are diesel-fueled, causing considerably less
pollution than those using petrol as fuel, the board chairman
said.

<HEADLINE> Army Daily Editorial: Make More Efforts for Reunification (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The editorial says, "Lee Teng-hui's perverse acts have cast a
shadow over the great cause of peaceful reunification, arousing
the indignation of the entire Chinese people and all PLA officers
and men."
</P>
<P>
So long as Lee does not stop his national splittist activities,
"We will never cease our struggle against splittism and the scheme
for the "independence of Taiwan'," it adds.
</P>
<P>
"We adhere to peaceful reunification but will never undertake
to abandon the use of force," it notes.
</P>
<P>
Striving to end the national separation by means of peace does
not mean that the process of peaceful reunification can be delayed
indefinitely, it says.
</P>
<P>
"The fact that we do not undertake to abandon the use of force
is not a threat directed at our Taiwan compatriots, but at some
foreign forces attempting to interfere in China's reunification and
those seeking the 'independence of Taiwan'," it stresses.
</P>
<P>
This also reflects the attitude of responsibility taken by the
Chinese Communist Party and government in settling the Taiwan
issue.
</P>
<P>
The editorial warns, "If foreign forces deliberately interfere
in China's reunification and if the situation of 'Taiwan
independence' emerges, we will use all means available,
including military means, to defend our motherland's unity and
territorial integrity. If the Taiwan authorities insist on having
their own way and engage in splittism, we will never sit by idly
and remain indifferent."
</P>
<P>
It is the sacred duty stipulated in the Constitution for the
PLA to safeguard China's unity and security and and defend her
territory, territorial waters and air space and her people working
in peace.
</P>
<P>
The PLA resolutely supports and implements to the letter the
eight propositions put forward by President Jiang Zemin on the
settlement of the Taiwan issue and the guideline of Premier Li
Peng's speech, it emphasizes.
</P>
<P>
"We will never permit a single inch of China's territory to be
split from our motherland or any foreign anti-China force to
interfere in China's internal affairs," it points out.
</P>
<P>
The PLA has the ability, means and confidence to defend
China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, safeguard China's
unity and fulfil the sacred mission assigned by the Party and
people, it adds.
</P>
<P>
Any attempt to create an "independent Taiwan", "two Chinas" or
"one China, one Taiwan" is doomed to failure, it notes.
</P>
<P>
The editorial calls on all PLA officers and men to work hard to
accomplish the great cause of China's reunification, under the
leadership of the Party Central Committee with Jiang Zemin at the
core.

<HEADLINE> Army Daily Editorial: Make More Efforts for Reunification (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 30 (Xinhua) -- An editorial to be carried by
the "Liberation Army Daily" tomorrow describes Chinese President
Jiang Zemin's speech on the reunification of the motherland
delivered a year ago as a programmatic document to settle the
issue of Taiwan during the new period.
</P>
<P>
The editorial, titled "Make More Efforts for the Reunification",
says Jiang's speech expounded Deng Xiaoping's idea of peaceful
reunification of the motherland and "one country, two systems",
and put forward a series of constructive opinions and propositions
for the promotion of the process of peaceful reunification.
</P>
<P>
It has fully shown the consistency and continuity of the policy
of the Chinese Communist Party on the settlement of the issue of
Taiwan, the editorial says, adding that the speech reflects the
determination of the Party and the government and their sincerity
toward the promotion of the country's reunification.
</P>
<P>
The speech is of far-reaching historical significance, the
editorial stresses.
</P>
<P>
The editorial notes Chinese Premier Li Peng's speech at a
meeting here this morning at the Great Hall of the People, to mark
the first anniversary of Jiang Zemin's speech.
</P>
<P>
It says that Li Peng's speech stressed that China's
reunification is exclusively its own internal affair, and no
foreign power can be allowed to interfere in it under any pretext.
</P>
<P>
The editorial adds that whoever going in for "Taiwan
independence" will be the chief culprit sabotaging the
reunification of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
The editorial says, "Peaceful reunification" and "one country,
two systems" constitute the fundamental principle of the Chinese
Communist Party and government for the settlement of the issue of
Taiwan and the realization of the reunification of China.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Communist Party and government have made
unremitting efforts to this end, it notes.
</P>
<P>
The editorial says Jiang's speech once again suggested holding
negotiations in accordance with the one-China principle to end the
state of hostility between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
It quoted Jiang as saying, "We will do our best to realize
peaceful reunification without Chinese fighting Chinese."
</P>
<P>
This fully demonstrates the sincere aspirations of the Chinese
Communist Party and government to settle the issue of Taiwan and
their feelings of kinship toward the Taiwan compatriots.
</P>
<P>
However, the Taiwan authorities headed by Lee Teng-hui, going
against the trend of the times, collaborate with foreign anti-China
forces in an attempt to create "two Chinas" or "one China, one
Taiwan", it notes.

<HEADLINE> Former South Korean President Asks for Trial Delay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Former South Korean President
Chun Doo-hwan, currently receiving medical treatment at the
National Police Hospital here, requested today that his graft
trial be postponed due to his illness.
</P>
<P>
Chun asked the Seoul District Court to delay his trial,
scheduled for February 5, through his lawyer Suk Jin-kang.
</P>
<P>
In his application, Chun said that he would not be able to
attend the trial as he was suffering from nausea and dizziness,
apparent side-effects of his three-week hunger strike in prison.
</P>
<P>
Chun, who was arrested on December 3 last year, has been
indicted for raising a huge slush fund during his 1980-1988
presidency, including 270 million U.S. dollars in bribes from
businessmen in return for awarding them government contracts and
other favors.
</P>
<P>
The ex-president said in the application that he would be
unable to give sincere testimony if he undergoes lengthy
questioning and requested that the trial be put off until his
health recovers.
</P>
<P>
It was not immediately known whether the Seoul District Court
has consented to Chun's request.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the graft charges, Chun has also been indicted
for insurrection and treason along with former President Roh
Tae-woo for their roles in the 1979 military coup and the 1980
military crackdown on the pro-democracy movement in Kwangju,
capital of South Cholla Province.
</P>
<P>
Chun, who was the military strongman after the 1979 coup,
seized power on August 27, 1980, and ruled the nation until
February 1988.
</P>
<P>
He was followed in the presidency by Roh, who gave up power in
February 1993 to Kim Young-sam, the first civilian president in
South Korea in more than 30 years.
</P>
<P>
Chun will be South Korea's second former head of state to stand
trial. Roh, who was taken into custody on November 16 last year,
is already on trial on charges of taking 370 million dollars in
bribes from businessmen while in office.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Two men who promised to take 45
Iranian men to Japan for menial labor have been arrested here for
swindling up to 266,000 U.S. dollars, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The two men had established a company named Payam-e Emdad and
received money from unemployed men in exchange for jobs in Japan,
evening newspaper Kayhan said.
</P>
<P>
Faced with a grim job prospect, young Iranian men including
some well-educated try to find menial jobs in other countries
including the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Japan and Malaysia where
they can earn dollars.
</P>
<P>
The two were charged with taking 14 men to Japan via Malaysia
and Singapore. It is easier for them to obtain visas to the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
"Once they took the men to Malaysia and Singapore, they
abandoned them," the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The two men got invitations to Japan through their connections
with some Japanese private firms, according to Kayhan.
</P>
<P>
It reported that authorities had issued a warrant for the
arrest of a third man said to be in Malaysia and identified only
as Qodrat.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper did not identify the two charged by their
last names. They were identified with their first names as Iraj
and Behzad.

<HEADLINE> JLG Experts Meet on Budget for Transition Period </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Experts of the Sino-British
Joint Liaison Group meet here today to hold the 6th round of talks
on the preparation of Hong Kong's budget for the transition
period.
</P>
<P>
At a news briefing after the meeting, Chen Zuo'er, Chinese JLG
representative, said that the Chinese side has put forward to the
British side reasonable suggestions concerning Hong Kong's
financial budget for the year of 1997-98.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Chinese side expects positive response from
the British side, adding that he hopes the two sides will reach
consensus before the drafting of the 1997-98 budget starts two
months later.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that Hong Kong will witness a great historical change
in the financial year of 1997-98 and the drafting and
implementing of Hong Kong's 1997-98 budget have particular
significance.
</P>
<P>
The drafting of the 1997-98 budget must be undertaken in a
period when the British Government still exercises its rule over
Hong Kong, but the Government of Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (HK SAR) will have to implement the budget in 75 percent of
the financial year, he said.
</P>
<P>
In April 1996 when the 1997-98 budget is drafted, there will be
neither HK SAR's leadership nor chief executive. In this case,
the central government of China is duty-bond to represent future
HK SAR's government to participate in the drafting of the budget,
he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the role of the Chinese side in the drafting of
Hong Kong's 1997-98 budget will be greatly different from that in
the drafting of Hong Kong's 1996-97 budget.
</P>
<P>
After 1997, the drafting and implementing of Hong Kong's budget
will be totally done by the HK SAR Government and the central
government of China will not be involved in the work, he said.
</P>
<P>
The JLG expert meeting on budget will end on Thursday.

<P>
BEIJING, January 30 (Xinhua) -- The China National Technology
Import and Export Corporation (CNTIC), China's leading technology
trader, has vowed to boost its business this year to promote the
country's technology trade.
</P>
<P>
The CNTIC did a record four billion US dollars in business last
year, ranking third in the country's 500 biggest trading companies.
</P>
<P>
Tong Changyin, CNTIC's general manager, told a meeting here
today that his corporation did 3.78 billion US dollars-worth of
technology imports, which covered the areas of power, chemical
industry, petrochemicals, telecommunications, transportation and
metallurgy.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the export of machinery and electronical products,
including complete sets of equipment and related technology, took
up 60 percent of the corporation's total exports last year.
</P>
<P>
According to Tong, the corporation will expand its business
this year, especially exports of technology, complete sets of
equipment and high value-added as well as technology-intensive
products involving electronics and machinery.
</P>
<P>
In 1995 China signed 3,629 contracts for technology and
equipment imports, with a total contractual value of 13 billion US
dollars, and a total of 533 contracts for technology exports were
signed in the year, with a contractual value totalling 2.5 billion
US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Tong said that his corporation, the country's biggest
technology trader, will make greater efforts to turn itself into a
comprehensive one by accelerating the pace of its globalization,
industrialization, conglomeration and business pluralization.
</P>
<P>
The corporation now has 30 branches in more than 20 countries
and regions, which also achieved record highs in their business
turnovers last year.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the corporation will set up a European center
this year to coordinate and guide its business in the area.

<HEADLINE> UN Envoy Visits Kabul to Start Fresh Peace Mission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 30 (Xinhua) -- UN special envoy to
Afghanistan Mehmud Mestiri arrived in Kabul today to start his
fresh peace mission, a report from Kabul said.
</P>
<P>
His program in Kabul is not disclosed, but the report quoted
sources in Kabul as saying that Mestiri would meet with Ahmed Shah
Masood, chief commander of forces loyal to Afghan President
Burhanuddin Rabbani.
</P>
<P>
Masood last month proposed a four-point peace formula which was
rejected by the Afghan opposition including Taliban. His proposals
called for a ceasefire, opening of highways, exchange of
prisoners, and negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Mestiri visited Kabul, Kandahar and the northern part of
Afghanistan earlier this month to broker peace among the warring
factions, but he could not meet the leadership of the Taliban
Islamic student militia.
</P>
<P>
Kabul came under jet and rocket attack Monday, killing one
person and causing heavy damage.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC)
is making arrangements for the airlifting of food supplies to
Kabul for the most vulnerable groups, an ICRC official said in
Kabul today.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Researchers in Hong Kong are
to produce the first maps of the little known local coral reefs
and their fish in an effort to save them before pollution and
development wipe them out.
</P>
<P>
Today's "South China Morning Post" reported that the three-year
study, with a fund of 1.83 million HK dollars, would map
surviving corals, estimate their diversity site by site, and
characterize associated fish.
</P>
<P>
The first results will be presented at the third international
conference on marine biology of the South China Sea in Hong Kong
in October, at which delegates from 14 countries and regions will
discuss wider conservation issues for the whole area.
</P>
<P>
Although all Hong Kong waters will be surveyed, the project has
pinpointed about 20 sites for more detailed study in the
territory's eastern waters, according to the report.

<HEADLINE> Output of 10 Nonferrous Metals to Surpass Four Million Tons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 30 (Xinhua) -- China turned out 4.25 million
tons of copper, lead, zinc, nickel, aluminum, magnesium, titanium,
antimony, tin and mercury last year.
</P>
<P>
This was revealed at a national four-day work conference on
nonferrous metals which opened here today.
</P>
<P>
Statistics provided at the meeting show that last year the
country witnessed a net increase of three million tons of all the
ten nonferrous metals over 1981.
</P>
<P>
Of the total production last year, 2.35 million tons were
turned out by enterprises directly under the China National
Nonferrous Metals Industry Corporation, with income from sales
exceeding 49.9 billion yuan, an increase of 27 percent over 1994,
and pre-tax profits reaching 5.92 billion yuan, up 43.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
During the 1991-1995 period the country had a balance of supply
and demand in the sector. Except for copper, all the rest was sold
on the international market.
</P>
<P>
The production of copper last year was 843,000 tons, an
increase of 23.3 percent over 1994 and believed the biggest growth
rate among the ten nonferrous metals.
</P>
<P>
Of the corporation's total 1.8 billion US dollars-worth earned
from foreign trade in 1995, 1.1 billion US dollars came from
exports, up 57.37 percent over 1994.
</P>
<P>
Over the five years the corporation and its enterprises
invested a total of 4.3 billion yuan in infrastructure
construction and four billion yuan more in 20 key
technology-upgrading projects.
</P>
<P>
More efforts will be exerted to restructure the product,
capital and technology sectors and enterprise organization in the
coming five years.
</P>
<P>
By the turn of this century the country is expected to turn out
five million tons of nonferrous metals a year, and the industry is
expected to set up 20 group enterprises.

<P>
HONG KONG, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong parents are urged
to put less pressure on their children, who tend to suffer from
psychological problems.
</P>
<P>
A health survey of 50,000 primary students shows that one out
of 57 is faced with such problems as low self-esteem and poor
relationships with parents, reports today's Hong Kong Standard, a
local English newspaper.
</P>
<P>
A specialist in children's mental health said parents had to be
realistic about their kids' abilities, and avoid putting overdue
pressure on them.
</P>
<P>
Director of Health Dr. Margaret Chan Fung Fu-chun urged parents
not to spend time with their children simply for study purpose,
but spend more time finding out what they need, according to the
daily paper.
</P>
<P>
The survey shows 25 percent of the 12,500 children screened
have encountered physical problems of vision, growth and
hearing. More than half are shortsighted or color-blinded and one

<HEADLINE> S. Leonean Leader Visits Burkina Faso, Cote d'Ivoire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Sierra Leone's new Head of
State Brigadier Julius Maada Bio left here today with a four-man
delegation for talks with Burkinese leader Blaise Compaore on
possible mediation in Sierra Leone's five-year-old civil war.
</P>
<P>
Bio, who ousted his predecessor Captain Valentine Strasser in
a January-16 bloodless coup and made an offer of dialogue to the
rebel Revolutional United Front (RUF) the following day, will
also visit Cote d'Ivoire for similar talks with Ivorian political
leaders, diplomats here said.
</P>
<P>
Diplomats said Burkina Faso and Cote d'Ivoire are two states
"crucial to the peace process" in Sierra Leone as both countries
have repeatedly been accused of siding with the RUF, a claim
which the two countries deny.
</P>
<P>
The RUF, which launched its revolt in 1991, on January 23
declared a unilateral week-long ceasefire to assess "how serious
the new Sierra Leonean military leadership is about peace".
</P>
<P>
It had earlier indicated that it was prepared to hold talks
with the government, their first unconditional offer of
negotiations since the beginning of the civil war.
</P>
<P>
The civil war has wrecked Sierra Leone's mining-based economy
and driven more than one-third of the country's four million
people form their homes.
</P>
<P>
Bio's visit followed RUF attacks on a number of villages in
southern Sierra Leone on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Though observers called the episode a serious violation of the
ceasefire announced by the RUF, diplomats said it was yet to be
"established" if the RUF was responsible.
</P>
<P>
Observers said the news of the attacks had dampened the spirit
of optimism and relief which had come about since the RUF said it
was willing to talk peace with the government.
</P>
<P>
"It may be a renegade group that was responsible for these
attacks," one observer said.

<P>
TEHRAN, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Iran is to build a giant oil
reservoir that can hold a maximum of 1 billion liters of crude oil
in Bandar Abbas, northern coast of the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
Alireza Babaii, project manager of the Bandar Abbas Refinery,
was quoted by today's Persian daily Abrar as saying that the
refinery is due to become operational by March 1997.
</P>
<P>
Another Persian daily, Jomhuri Eslami, claimed that would be
the biggest modern oil storage facilities in the country which is
the second largest oil exporter and the fourth largest oil
producer in the world.
</P>
<P>
The whole refinery project includes the construction of a
platform for unloading crude oil adjacent to a steel jetty, the
laying of a pipeline connecting the oil reservoir to the jetty.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, a 26-inch diameter pipeline traversing 450 kilometers
will also be installed from Bandar Abbas to Rafsanjan in Kerman
province.
</P>
<P>
The proposed storage facility has been designed to enable it to
receive imported products and store some 32,000 barrels of oil
processed in the refinery in 39 storage compartments, Babaii
explained.

BEIRUT, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Israeli warplanes this noon
carried out air raids at suspected guerrilla bases on Telal Mlita
hills at Iglim Al-Toffah, or Province of Apple, in south Lebanon,
but no casualties have been reported by security sources.
</P>
<P>
Iglim Al-Toffah is often used by Shiite militants of the
pro-Iranian Hezbollah or Party of God as a spring board to launch
attacks at Israeli forces and their client militia the South
Lebanese Army (SLA) in an occupied border strip in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Security sources said that two Israeli fighter-bombers,
covered by four other warplanes, started the air raids just
before 1:00 p.m. (11:00 GMT).
</P>
<P>
The Israeli planes carried out three air raids at Tilal Mlita,
in each of which the two jets fired two air-to-surface missiles,
the sources said.
</P>
<P>
This was the first time for the Israeli air force to attack
guerrilla targets in south Lebanon since the beginning of this

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Swaziland's Crippling Week-long Strike  Suspends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Swaziland's nationwide
strike which had brought the economy in the southern African
Kingdom to a standstill last week suspended last night pending
talks between the government and unions.
</P>
<P>
The strike was called by the Swaziland Federation of Trade
Unions (SFTU) on January 22 in a bid to press the government to
meet the SFTU's 27 demands, including a lifting of the 23-year
ban on free political activity in the Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
The pro-democracy strike was, however, supported by the banned
anti-government political parties, including the People's United
Democratic Movement and the Swaziland Youth Congress.
</P>
<P>
The decision to suspend the strike was reached at a marathon
meeting of union leaders in the country's commercial center
Manzini on Monday. The Swazi government guaranteed the employees'
safety at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
"The General Council has recommended that immediate suspension
of the mass stay-away to allow meaningful and creative
negotiations between government and the executive of the SFTU,"
said SFTU Assistant General Secretary Jabulani Nxumalo.
</P>
<P>
The suspension of the week-long politically motivated strike
was immediately welcomed by employers and business in the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
"We welcome this news very much indeed," said Swaziland
Chamber of Commerce and Industry Executive Director Harvey Bird,
saying that the strike had cost the country about 10 million Rand
(about 2.74 million US dollar) a day.
</P>
<P>
During the past week, life in Swaziland's major towns were
paralyzed by the strike. Air flights stopped, schools closed and
the tourist industry suffered serious damage.
</P>
<P>
About 75,000 of Swaziland's 90,000 private sector employees
went on strike, the usually-bustling streets of Capital Mbabane
and commercial center Manzini were deserted, without even
basket sellers or hawkers to be seen.
</P>
<P>
The SFTU had once claimed that the strike would continue till
the government moved to meet the organizers' demands.
</P>
<P>
However, the Swazi government stood firm on the strike and
urged workers to return to work.
</P>
<P>
Last Saturday, King Mswati III of Swaziland, who had remained
silent on the strike until then, declared war on the SFTU and
ordered his subjects to return to normal life and business.
</P>
<P>
Mswati III accused strike organizers of attempting to
overthrow him, saying the strike was politically motivated.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, pressure has been growing for several years for
Mswati III to dismantle his non-party government and allow free
political activity outlawed by his father King Sobhuza in 1972.
</P>
<P>
Swaziland is a small land-locked country surrounded by South
Africa and Mozambique.

<HEADLINE> Iran's Hard-liners Drop Motion of Impeachment against President (Part II) (By Chen Ming) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After the eight-year war with Iraq, the Iranian government
under Rafsanjani' leadership initiated huge reconstruction and
development projects. A whopping 42 percent of Iran's budget for
next year is allocated to the development projects.
</P>
<P>
An economist estimated that the total damage of the war on the
economic infrastructure of Iran was over 1,000 billion
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
"That explains the heavy investment that Iran has made in past
seven years to compensate for the effects of the war," he said.
</P>
<P>
"If Rafsanjani leaves the office, the new government might put
a stop to all the projects that he has started, leading to a huge
loss of the nation's wealth," he added.
</P>
<P>
A well-informed source told Xinhua that there was an agreement
between Khamenei and Rafsanjani that either Rafsanjani or his
First Vice-President Hassan Habibi would run in the presidential
elections of 1997 so that the development projects would continue.
</P>
<P>
The Constitution of the Islamic Republic does not allow
Rafsanjani to run for a third term. Habibi has told the press he
does not wish to run for presidency.
</P>
<P>
"Either the constitution will be amended to allow Rafsanjani
to run or Habibi will run with Rafsanjani's backing which will
assure his victory," the source said.
</P>
<P>
Iran's state-owned Radio and Television has recently increased
its coverage of Habibi's activities and statements, leading the
observers here to believe that, despite his denials, he is a
favored candidate for presidency.
</P>
<P>
The Sorbonne-educated Habibi is equally loyal to Khamenei and
Rafsanjani. He is well respected as an author, thinker and
scholar and above all for staying above factional politics.
His name was markedly absent on the statement issued by
Rafsanjani's vice-presidents and ministers.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts here said that even though the prospect of
a Rafsanjani-led government in 1997 was unclear, the 61-year-old
president has gained in strength in recent days as SCC has ruled
out the impeachment.
</P>
<P>
But they added that as in the past many fights are still to be
fought between Rafsanjani and the parliament.
</P>
<P>
The continued rejection of the candidates suggested by
Rafsanjani shows that the wound in the rightist camp that control
the government and the Parliament have yet to be healed.

<HEADLINE> Iran's Hard-liners Drop Motion of Impeachment against President (Part I) (By Chen Ming) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Iran's hard-liners have dropped
their motion of impeachment against President Akbar Hashemi
Rafsanjani and his cabinet members, a local newspaper reported
today.
</P>
<P>
"Members of the cabinet are like our brothers. We will not
impeach them," the English-language daily, Iran News, quoted a
member of the parliament as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, that does not mean President Rafsanjani has won a
complete victory in the first round of conflicts with the
hard-liners in the Islamic regime.
</P>
<P>
The conservative camp headed by Parliament Speaker Ali Akbar
Nateq-Nouri still rejected the nomination of five candidates
proposed by Rafsanjani and 16 other senior government officials
for the crucial forthcoming parliament elections.
</P>
<P>
A-week-long registration of candidates began today across the
country. A total of 196 constituencies will elect 270 members out
of 5,000 candidates for the Fifth Term of the Parliament on March
8.
</P>
<P>
The Persian-language daily, Jomhuri Eslami, quoted the speaker
for Society of Combatant Clergy (SCC), which controls the
Parliament, as saying that his faction was adamant in rejecting
the five candidates suggested by the president.
</P>
<P>
"None of the five people in the list which had been suggested
(by Rafsanjani) have been approved," Reza Taqavi told the paper.
</P>
<P>
The SCC's rejection of the five candidates suggested by
Rafsanjani fueled a war of words last week between the moderate
president and the conservative parliament.
</P>
<P>
After SCC threatened that they would impeach Rafsanjani, Iran's
Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei intervened on Sunday to bring the
situation under control and bring the two factions closer.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said that Khamenei's intervention came just at
the right time before Iran could face its worst political feud
ever since the death of the founder of the Islamic Revolution
Ayatollah Rouhollah Khomeini.
</P>
<P>
"Despite his differences with Rafsanjani on many policy issues,
Khamenei intervened because he knew if Rafsanjani was impeached
it would be hard for him to find a competent caretaker
government," one observer said.
</P>
<P>
"Khamenei has recently said that he wanted Iran to muster
all of its resources in the path of development. Despite the
tensions that have existed between him and Rafsanjani on policy
matters, Khamenei realizes that only Rafsanjani can finish his
massive development projects," said the observer.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister of
Tanzania Frederick Sumaye has urged Members of the Isles House
Representatives (Parliament) to forget their differences and
work together to hasten development in the country.
</P>
<P>
Opening a three-day seminar on business procedures in Zanzibar
Town on Monday, Sumaye said the people wanted development and not
friction or polemics.
</P>
<P>
He said animosity among the islanders would not help Zanzibar to
further its development but may stall efforts of bringing development.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister, in a speech read on his behalf by the Minister
in his office, Bakari Mbonde, said the representatives should
co-operate with the Zanzibar government.
</P>
<P>
Sumaye stressed it was an appropriate time now for the MPs to
show their patriotism and love to the country instead of widening
their political ideologies.
</P>
<P>
He urged the representatives to listen to ideas of other political
camps.
</P>
<P>
In last October general elections, Salmin Amour was re-elected
the president of Zanzibar. However, the opposition Civic United
Front (CUF) refused to recognize the results of the election.
</P>
<P>
A report reaching here today from the town of Zanzibar said
that all the 27 opposition members of the Zanzibar House of
Representatives, boycotted the three-day seminar.

<HEADLINE> Thailand's Central Bank Defines Future Role </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 30 (Xinhua) -- The central bank of Thailand
will aim to improve local financial institutions and upgrade the
financial system to internationally accepted standards during the
next three years.
</P>
<P>
To do this, the Bank of Thailand (BOT) will concentrate on
three things: making Thailand the financial hub of the region,
trimming back the country's current account deficit and actively
promoting the distribution of wealth to rural areas.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting Monday, board of directors of the bank discussed
plans for 1996-1998 and decided that the central bank will
support the improvement of local financial institution's potential
to complete with other countries as part of its attempt to
increase Thailand's competitiveness and become the regional
financial hub, Kleo-thong Hetrakul, spokeswoman of the bank, was
quoted today as saying by local media.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the central bank will develop investment banking
activity and provide more financial help to other countries in the
region, she said.
</P>
<P>
Some of the existing policies and regulations must be tightened
up to enhance the central bank's supervision and control over
financial institutions, so as to distribute lending and financial
services more widely over the country.

<HEADLINE> Australian Officials Refuse to Confirm Alleged Seles Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Australian tennis officials on
Tuesday refused to confirm reports that a death threat had been
made against joint world number one Monica Seles last week,
although police said they were investigating a threat.
</P>
<P>
Melbourne's Herald Sun newspaper reported on Tuesday that
Tennis Australia, organisers of last week's Australian Open, had
received an anonymous telephone call last Friday during which
Seles' life had been threatened.
</P>
<P>
Seles had not been told of the threat, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Seles defeated Germany's Anke Huber in the women's singles
final the next day.
</P>
<P>
A statement from Victorian Police said they had been alerted by
Tennis Australia to a security threat made against an unnamed
tennis player during the Australian Open.
</P>
<P>
The brief statement said extra police had been assigned to
tighten security around the player during the tournament.
</P>
<P>
The Melbourne newspaper report said police had investigated the
call and had stationed uniformed police officers at each entrance
to the main stadium of the tournament venue, Melbourne's Flinders
Park.
</P>
<P>
Seles' Australian Open win was her first grand slam victory
since returning to tennis last August after being stabbed by an
obsessed Steffi Graf fan at a tournament in Hamburg in April,
1993.

that his rival Linford Christie of Britain is sure to defend his
Olympic 100 meters title in Atlanta later this year.
</P>
<P>
Bailey, 28, was convinced that Christie has been training all

Christie, who has been training in Australia, won the title of

He announced last June that he would not defend his title,

He argued: "I can't get more famous or more known than I am now. I
have nothing to win and everything to lose."
</P>

But he had announced to compete in the British AAA Championship
in June, which is also the Olympic trials, which has increased
speculation about his intentions.
</P>

He also said at Adelaide: "I want to go out with a bang this

</P>
<P>
Wilander said he was "in great form" following back trouble.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Meeting to Mark 1st Anniversary of Jiang's Speech on  Taiwan Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 30 (Xinhua) -- More than 400 representatives
from all walks of life in the Chinese capital gathered in the
Great Hall of the People here today to mark the first anniversary
of Jiang Zemin's speech on the Taiwan issue.
</P>
<P>
Chinese leaders Li Peng, Li Ruihuan and Liu Huaqing attended
the meeting, presided over by Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister
Qian Qichen. Premier Li Peng delivered an important speech.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng said that the speech delivered by Jiang Zemin a year
ago reflects the consistency and continuity of the policy of the
Communist Party of China and the Chinese government for resolving
the Taiwan question.
</P>
<P>
"It also embodies their determination and sincerity in
improving relations across the Taiwan Straits and promoting the
reunification of the motherland," he added.
</P>
<P>
He reaffirmed that there is only one China and that no matter
how the way of electing Taiwan's leaders changes, the stark
reality that Taiwan is a part of Chinese territory and its leaders
are only leaders of one region of China cannot change.
</P>
<P>
If a few people attempt to take the advantage of the change in
selection of Taiwan's leaders as an excuse to carry out their
separatist activities under the cloak of legality, they will get
themselves nowhere, he said.
</P>
<P>
Any anti-China foreign forces take this as an excuse to meddle
in the country's internal affairs and support "Taiwan
independence", he said, it will also surely be opposed by the
Chinese Government and the entire Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
"Any attempt to set the interests of the Taiwan compatriots
against the interests of the Chinese nation is bound to failure,"
he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Qian Qichen said that during the past year, Jiang Zemin's
important speech has not only drawn enthusiastic support from
people from both sides of the Taiwan Straits, Hong Kong and Macao
compatriots, overseas Chinese and all those who are concerned with
the reunification of China, but also promoted the development of
the relations across the straits.
</P>
<P>
However, he added, Taiwan authorities headed by Lee Teng-hui
have not only failed to comply with the popular feelings and will
and respond positively to the "eight viewpoints and proposals,"
but intensified its international activities in creating "two
Chinas" and "one China, one Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
He said the activities have resulted in the present tense
situation between the two sides of the straits and directly
jeopardized the fundermental interests of all Chinese people
including the Taiwan compatriots, and this naturally caused great
indignation of the more than 1.2 billion Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
The mammoth struggle launched by the whole Chinese people,
including compatriots from Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macao as well as
overseas Chinese against separatism and "Taiwan independence" is
totally justified, and fully demonstrated the firm determination
and capability of the Chinese people in safeguarding sovereignty
and territorial integrity, he said.

<HEADLINE> Poll Results Must Be Honoured, Tanzanian President Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 30 (Xinhua) -- President Benjamin Mkapa
has asked Britain and other donor countries to help resolve the
Zanzibar political stalemate by educating the parties on
political pluralism and the need to honour election results.
</P>
<P>
In Ocober 1995 general elections, Salmin Amour, the Ruling
Revolutionary Party (CCM) presidential candidate, was re-elected
the President of Zanzibar. However, the opposition Tanzanian
Civic United Front (CUF) refused to recognize the election
results, saying that "the election has been rigged".
</P>
<P>
Speaking during talks with visiting British Minister for
Overseas Development and Co-operaion Baroness Lynda Chalker at
the state house here last evening, President Mkapa said that
donor countries who have vast experiencee on political pluralism,
normally honour election results and the losing parties do not
cause chaos but co-operate with the winning party.
</P>
<P>
He, therefore, urged the donor countries to come out clearly
and help explain to Zanzibaris that it was against the law and
democratic practices for the losing party to call for civil
disobedience instead of cooperating with the government of the
day.
</P>
<P>
A statement by the State House quoted Mkapa as saying that
there was need for Tanzanians to understand that accepting defeat
honourably was an important practice which must be engrained in
the political culture.
</P>
<P>
The president thanked Britain for its grants to enable
Tanzania to conduct the general elections.
</P>
<P>
He appreciated Britain's intention to help Tanzania in its
efforts to establish the Revenue Authority, expected to start
functioning in July, this year.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, he also called on Britainf to put
pressure on Burundi and Rwanda to resolve their differences
amicably, thus creating an agreeable climate for the return of
refugees.
</P>
<P>
The British minister arrived here Monday afternoon for a
three-day visit in the country.  enditem

<HEADLINE> Cretien Warns Quebec Not to Break Away </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Prime Minister Jean
Chretien warned today that if Canada can be broken up, then so can
Quebec.
</P>
<P>
"If Canada is divisible, Quebec is divisible. It's the same
logic," Chretien told reporters before he went into the Liberal
Party's caucus meeting in Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
Chretien's comment was a response to remarks made by the
separatist leader Lucien Bouchard who became Quebec's premier
today.
</P>
<P>
After taking over the rein of the separatist Parti Quebecois on
Saturday, Bouchard had this to say: "Canada is divisible because
Canada is not a real country. There are two peoples, two nations
and two territories, and this is ours."
</P>
<P>
Chretien said that except for Francophones, there are also lots
of other people in Quebec, including Anglophones and natives in
the north who were there before the French and English people
arrived.
</P>
<P>
The split of Quebec has become a hot topic in the current
national unity debate. Stephane Dion, the newly-appointed
Intergovernmental Affairs Minister in the Chretien cabinet said
that natives and municipalities could separate from an independent
Quebec.
</P>
<P>
"You cannot consider Canada divisible but the territory of
Quebec sacred," said Dion, a staunch federalist from Quebec.
</P>
<P>
Dion's idea was supported by Conservative leader Jean Charest
and Quebec Liberal leader Daniel Johnson. "If (separatists) have
a right to dissent, they can't deny the right to dissent to
others," Charest said on a TV program.
</P>
<P>
Johnson said yesterday that although his party has always said
that the province's territory is indivisible, the question "is
another of the unknowns" if Quebeckers vote for sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile a New Canadian Unity Movement is officially launched
in western Quebec. Its members commit to stay in Canada even if
Quebec votes to separate from Canada.

<HEADLINE> Philippine President Calls for Anti-terrorism Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
today hammered at the urgency of enacting an anti-terrorism law,
warning that failure to do so could cripple the combat against the
modern threat.
</P>
<P>
In his speech at the fifth anniversary of the Philippine
National Police, the president stressed the need for Congress to
examine legislative proposals in detail to come out with a law to
fight terrorism and at the same time safeguard civil liberty.
</P>
<P>
The president said public safety is the foundation of all
progress -- economic, political, social.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, however, Ramos pointed out that economic
restructuring and tax reforms remain at the top of the
administration's legislative agenda.
</P>
<P>
The anti-terrorism bill proposed by Malacanang has been turned
down by Philippine legislative body recently. Local reports said
the bill can be a prelude for imposing martial law which was
vigorously denied by President Ramos.

LUSAKA, January 30 (Xinhua)-- Zambia Telecommunication Limited
(ZAMTEL) has so far lost telephone cables worth 300 million US
dollars by vandalism and thefts, the local weekly Financial Mail

</P>
<P>
Thieves have been wreaking havoc on Zamtel and Zambia
Electricity Supply Corporation (ZESCO) cables, transformers and

Despite several notices warning the vandals against stiff
punishment and appealing to the public to cooperate with Zamtel
and help arrest the culprits, vandalism has continued and more
cables have been stolen, it admitted.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Zamtel needs about 200 million US dollars to
connect 100,000 new lines for telephone applicants, it said.
</P>
<P>
More money is required to restructure and revamp the whole
system so that the firm can meet the growing demand for telephone

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin's Propositions on Taiwan are Programmatic Document (4) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
He pointed out that some leaders of Taiwan authorities have
increased collaboration with anti-Chinese forces abroad by
advocating a "struggle for more space for existence", the creation
of "two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan", weakening the
foundation of relations across the straits and causing serious
setbacks. "Quite naturally, their misdeeds have been
opposed by all the Chinese people, including the Taiwan people."
</P>
<P>
"Whoever going in for 'Taiwan independence' will be the chief
culprit sabotaging China's reunification and any of his attempts
to defend himself is futile," Li said. The perverse acts of some
leaders of Taiwan authorities have contributed to unstable
relations across the straits, directly jeopardized economic
expansion and social stability in Taiwan, and damaged the
immediate interests of the Taiwan compatriots.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan authorities have recently deliberately given a
false appearance of improving relations with the mainland, but
have in fact intensified efforts to create "two Chinas," he said,
and with their "elastic and pragmatic diplomacy", they have bought
large amounts of military equipment.
</P>
<P>
This only serves to demonstrate that they have been plotting
the independence of Taiwan under the pretext of achieving
detente. "Their attempts are doomed to fail," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Only when Taiwan authorities give up their attempts to create
"two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan" not only verbally, but
also in their actions, will relations between the two sides
develop normally, he said.
</P>
<P>
"As long as Taiwan authorities do not cease their activities to
divide the motherland, we will not stop our struggle against their
schemes even for a single day" he said. "All consequences arising
therefrom cannot but be borne entirely by those leaders of Taiwan
authorities who are bent on the divisive activities." Li
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 30 (Xinhua) -- The Yemeni and Eritrean foreign
ministers will meet here in a few days to discuss the dispute over
the Red Sea island of Greater Hanish between their two countries.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's leading newspaper Al Ahram reported today that the
foreign ministers of Egypt, Ethiopia and France will participate
in the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted an official source at the Yemeni Foreign
Ministry as saying that the five-party meeting was proposed by
France, which suggested that the five ministers hold one meeting
in Cairo and another in Addis Ababa to discuss how to find a final
and just solution to the crisis through direct dialogue between
Yemen and Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
The French initiative was welcomed by both Egypt and Ethiopia,
said the Yemeni source, adding that contacts are getting underway
between the five parties to fix a date for the Cairo meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Eritrean troops occupied the island last month after a
fierce battle with the Yemeni forces. Both countries have claimed
the sovereignty over the island.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, Ethiopia and France have been trying to mediate a
solution to the dispute.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin's Propositions on Taiwan are Programmatic Document (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The premier said that Jiang Zemin called for increased economic
exchanges and cooperation between the two sides of the Taiwan
Straits to face global economic expansion in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also called on the two sides to carry on the traditional
virtues of Chinese culture, to take practical steps to facilitate
the direct exchange of trade, mail and air and shipping services
across the straits, and to increase contacts and understanding
among compatriots on both sides of the straits.
</P>
<P>
"Our principle and policy toward Taiwan is very pragmatic and
in the overall interests of the Chinese nation," Li pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"We will continue the principle and policy for a long time to
develop relations across the straits and create more favorable
conditions for peaceful unification," Li said.
</P>
<P>
"We have consistently stood for reunification of the motherland
by peaceful means, but we have not forsworn the use of force," the
premier said. "This is not directed at our Taiwanese compatriots,
but at foreign forces who attempt to interfere in China's
reunification and those who attempt to seek the independence of
Taiwan. The reunification of the motherland is exclusively China's
internal affair, in which no foreign force may interfere in any
way."
</P>
<P>
The premier went on to point out that the Chinese Communist
Party and Chinese government will continue to encourage in every
way Taiwan manufacturers and business people investing in the
mainland, and will protect the legitimate rights and interests of
Taiwanese compatriots.
</P>
<P>
"We fully respect the lifestyle of our Taiwanese compatriots
and their aspirations to become masters of their own destiny," he
said. "We sincerely hope that our Taiwanese compatriots will work
together with us to create a new form of relations between the two
sides."
</P>
<P>
Li said that Jiang's speech had a profound impact on ties
between the two sides and on the reunification process. Some
leaders of the Taiwan authorities, however, are sticking to their
stand to divide the motherland, opposing the one China principle,
and showing no consideration for the overall interests of the
Chinese nation.

<P>
CANBERRA, January 30 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar ended
firmer against the US dollar today.
</P>
<P>
The local currency ended at 74.23 US cents from 73.93 US cents.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar continued to strengthen after Prime
Minister Paul Keating announced the date of the Federal election
on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Investors were forced to buy back the local currency after they
dumped it in expectation that the Australian dollar would drop in
elections jitters.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar failed to go lower after the announcement
of the election date.
</P>
<P>
The next movement of the currency will depend on the outcome of
the current account deficit figures due tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
Local economic forecasters expect the current account deficit
to rise to 2.05 billion Australian dollars (1.52 billion US
dollars) in December last year, the first time that it exceeded
two billion Australian dollars (1.48 billion US dollars) since
last June.
</P>
<P>
They said if the current account deficit figure was higher than
2.2 billion Australian dollars (1.63 billion US dollars), the
Australian dollar would drop sharply.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar was firmer against the Japanese yen,
ending at 79.12 yen from 79.03 yen on Monday.
</P>
<P>
But it dropped against the German mark to end at 1.0988 marks
from 1.1026 marks Monday.

<P>
In resolving the Taiwan issue, it is essential that China's own
affairs be handled well, Li said.
</P>
<P>
He explained, "We must adhere to Deng Xiaoping's theory of
building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the basic line
of the Party and build China into a modern country with political
stability, sustained economic growth, and overall development as
well as comprehensive national strength."
</P>
<P>
"We must pursue an independent foreign policy of peace, opposeg
hegemony and power politics, increase exchanges and cooperation
for development with countries all over the world on the basis of
the five principles of peaceful co-existence, and contribute to
the cause of world peace, development and progress," he continued.
</P>
<P>
He said that during the period of the Ninth Five-Year Plan for
National Economic and Social Development (1996-2000), the Chinese
government will resume the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong
and Macao.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, settling the Taiwan issue and achieving total
reunification of the motherland will be prominently put in front
of all the Chinese people, he said.
</P>
<P>
Li urged the Chinese people on both sides of the Taiwan Straits
to work together for reunification. "A united, strong and powerful
China will make even greater contributions to the cause of peace
and development for mankind," he said.

<HEADLINE> Li Peng Reaffirms Chinese Government's Taiwan Stand (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng today
reaffirmed the view that there is only one China and that no
matter how the method of choosing Taiwan's leaders changes, the
fact that Taiwan is an inalienable part of Chinese territory and
its leaders are only leaders of one region of China cannot change.
</P>
<P>
Li made these remarks at a meeting here this morning to mark
the first anniversary of a speech on reunification of China made
by Jiang Zemin, general secretary of the Central Committee of the
Communist Party of China (CPC) and president of China.
</P>
<P>
He said that the sovereignty of a nation belongs to all its
people. The sovereignty of China, which includes the region of
Taiwan, the Penghu Islands, Jinmen and Mazu, belongs to over 1.2
billion Chinese people who include the Taiwan compatriots. That
sovereignty does not belong exclusively to a certain portion of
people on Taiwan and shall never be altered by them, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Li noted that a few people attempting to use the changeover
of Taiwan's leaders as an excuse to give their divisive activities
a legal guise will get them nowhere.
</P>
<P>
Any anti-Chinese foreign power that tries to use that same
thing as a pretext for interfering in China's internal affairs and
supporting "Taiwan independence" will be firmly opposed by the
Chinese Government and all the Chinese people, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Any attempt to set the interests of the Taiwan compatriots
against the interests of the Chinese nation as a whole is
doomed to fail," he stressed.

<HEADLINE> Orphans in Tianjin Receive Adequate Care </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Children in China's orphanages
receive decent care and conditions are improving steadily, said
Sharon Gastright, head of the Tianjin International Committee for
Chinese Orphans.
</P>
<P>
The committee was set up in 1994 by foreign women residing in
Tianjin, the largest port city in north China, to raise funds for
children living in welfare houses and to get foreigners and some
international organizations to provide help for the orphans.
</P>
<P>
There are 210 orphans at the Tianjin Child Welfare House, of
whom only six are healthy, and all the others suffering from
various disabilities.
</P>
<P>
"We have been seeking development in an opening-up drive over
recent years, accepting help from all parts of society," said Yan
Jiying, director of the house.
</P>
<P>
"Foreigners visit the house almost daily, and the total number
is expected to be more than 10,000," Yan noted.
</P>
<P>
Many foreign women, most of whom are wives of executives with
foreign corporations, such as Motorola, P&AMP;G, and Wella, have
worked voluntarily for the welfare houses in recent years.
</P>
<P>
"I have lived here for two years, and I come to the house
almost every afternoon," Ms. Gastright said.
</P>
<P>
The committee has sponsored several donation schemes and
charity bazaars in recent years and American experts were invited
to hold medical care symposiums in the house.
</P>
<P>
Last summer, more than 100 American students did voluntary
works for the house during their summer vacation, with CBS making
a special news coverage of the event.
</P>
<P>
"Compared with developed countries, conditions here are not so
satisfactory, the children here, however, have received good care
and the workers have tried their best," Ms. Gastright said.
</P>
<P>
"We can't apply Western standards to welfare houses in China --
a developing country. What these children really need is your
helping hand, not commentary," she added.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Chinese national Wang Tao has
signed with Beijing Guo'an to become the first transferred soccer
player in the Professional League this season.
</P>
<P>
Wang, who moved to Chinese Army from Dalian on a record-making
660,000-yuan transfer deal last year, is expected to improve
league runner-up Beijing's winning chance this year.
</P>
<P>
But details of the deal, the first for a group of 34 soccer
players eligible for transfers this year, has yet to be disclosed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Tuesday's People's Daily reported that Shenzhen, who
moves to the top-flight professional league from Division B this
year, has struck a package deal with a Yugoslavian company for the
transfer of five Yugoslavian footballers.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Football Association (CFA) regulation stipulates
that a club could have as many as five foreign players at a time.
</P>
<P>
Shenzhen president Zeng Guoqiang and coach Zhou Huian had a
tough bargain with the company in Belgrade since January 19 and
finally reached the deal last Saturday, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
People's Daily did not report the financial details of the deal.
</P>
<P>
But the Yugoslavians will have to undergo the mandated physical
endurance test arranged by the CFA and if all pass Shenzhen will
be the first professional league side that claims five foreigners,
it said.

Richard Branson was delayed in his venture for an 18-day
round-the-earth hot-air balloon flight from Marrakech, Morocco.
</P>

Unfavored weather conditions had forced the Briton to postpone
time and again the take-off of the Virgin Global Challenger, the

Originally, Branson would start his venture on January 21,

<P>
Worth of 3 million U.S. dollars, the capsule was equipped with
most advanced communication systems and would float in the sea

<P>
HARBIN, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Remarkable achievement has been
made in upgrading technology of state-owned enterprises in this
capital of northeast China's Heilongjiang Province, which is an
important industrial base in the country.
</P>
<P>
During the past five years, local officials said, the province
invested a total of 10.8 billion yuan in 655 key projects which
are expected to add 18.45 billion yuan in output value and 2.84
billion yuan in pre-tax profits after going into operation.
</P>
<P>
With its more than 4,000 large industrial enterprises, the city
plays an important role in China as well as in Asia in
manufacturing equipment for hydro-electric power and thermal power
stations, and for the aircraft, pharmaceutical, tool, and bearing
industries.
</P>
<P>
However, outmoded technology and equipment, and a major
shortage of funds blocked these enterprises' development. To
change the situation, the province has imported more than 1,000
sets of equipment and 200 items of technology from abroad to
breathe some new life into its medium-sized and large state-owned
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Additional effort has also been put into developing new
production lines and into restructuring the product mix.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Demands Greece to Withdraw Soldiers from Disputed Islet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Turkey has demanded that Greece
withdraw its soldiers and its national flag from the two tiny
Kardak rocks in the Aegean sea.
</P>
<P>
After a three-hour meeting of top military and political
officials here late Monday, Turkish caretaker Prime Minister Tansu
Ciller told reporters that Turkey considered the rocks its own
territory and had no intention of yielding them.
</P>
<P>
"Turkey will by no means give up its sovereignty rights,"
Ciller said. "It is part of Turkey's territory ... we will put our
full decisiveness behind it."
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Deniz Baykal has summoned the Greek ambassador
in Ankara and gave him a protest note claiming the islet belonged
to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Baykal said Turkey wanted a diplomatic solution to the issue,
but said " we are prepared for every eventuality," indicating that
the armed forces were alerted.
</P>
<P>
Baykal said Greek claims to the islet were not backed by
international agreements.
</P>
<P>
The three-hour meeting followed a cabinet meeting earlier in
the day.
</P>
<P>
"We have discussed the situation and will now watch the
developments, " Baykal told a press conference after the cabinet
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Baykal maintained that Turkey did not accept the Greek claim
that the Imia (Kardak) rocks belonged to Greece and urged its NATO
ally to withdraw the 12 soldiers it stationed there.
</P>
<P>
But Greece had reportedly denied any military presence on the
islet.
</P>
<P>
The escalation in tension between the two NATO members
surfaced a week ago, when a Turkish ship crashed into the twin
rock group which is 3.8 nautical miles away from the Turkish shore.
</P>
<P>
It grew worse through the remarks of Greece's new foreign
minister Theodoros Pangalos who said that Turkey had "claimed
Greek land for the first time."
</P>
<P>
Greece and Turkey nearly went to war in 1987 in a dispute over
mineral rights in the Aegean. They argued last year over whether
Athens has the right to extend its territorial waters in the
Aegean to 12 miles from six miles.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Opposition's Plea on Polls Rejected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's Election Commission
(EC) has formally rejected the mainstream opposition parties' plea
to cancel the February 15 general elections fixed by the EC.
</P>
<P>
Sources said today that the chief election commissioner,
Justice A. K. M. Sadek has expressed his inability to cancel the
polls, saying that there would be a constitutional crisis if the
elections were not held in due time.
</P>
<P>
The expression was included in a letter to Zillur Rahman,
general secretary of the country's largest opposition party, the
Awami (people's) League (AL), but the AL office refused to receive
it, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Any citizen of the country or a worker of the AL could initiate
a case in the supreme judicial council against the EC if the
elections were not held within 90 days after dissolution of the
parliament as stipulated under the constitution, the letter
stressed.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on January 20, Zillur Rahman sent a letter to Sadek
demanding cancellation of the schedule for the national elections.
</P>
<P>
Since representatives of 69 percent of the voters in the
parliament and other opposition parties are not participating in
the coming polls, the election should be canceled, Rahman said.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin's Propositions on Taiwan are Programmatic Document (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Taiwan authorities also advocated the fallacy that the two
sides of the Taiwan Straits "are two political entities on equal
footing and not subordinate to each other," that have become
"independent international legal persons," that Taiwan could join
the United Nations and other international organizations which
only sovereign countries can join, and that "dual recognition is
necessary."
</P>
<P>
Premier Li noted that the fundamental aim of the Taiwan
authorities in persisting in such fallacies is precisely to
separate Taiwan from China and advocate "independence for Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
"This is where the fundamental differences between the Chinese
people and the Taiwan authorities lie," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Li, in the speech Jiang set forth a series of
constructive proposals, particularly that of again holding talks
on "formerly ending the state of hostility and accomplishing
peaceful reunification step by step."
</P>
<P>
For the first step, he suggested that negotiations be held and
an agreement reached on ending the state of hostility between the
two sides under the principle of only one China. In the same way
the two sides should take steps jointly to safeguard China's
sovereignty and territorial integrity and map out plans for the
future development of relations.
</P>
<P>
He said the proposal was intended to create a good, secure
environment and to settle questions concerning the immediate
interests of Taiwan compatriots, and that it has the support of
far-sighted people both in and outside Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan authorities have not abandoned their attempt to divide
the motherland, however, and they have put unrealistic conditions
on the proposal instead of making a positive response, thus
creating obstacles to negotiations between the two sides of the
Taiwan Straits, Premier Li said.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin's Propositions on Taiwan are Programmatic Document (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Premier Li Peng said here today
that the eight propositions put forward a year ago by President
Jiang Zemin on China's reunification are a "programmatic document
for resolving the Taiwan question."
</P>
<P>
On January 30, 1995, President Jiang delivered a speech whose
title was "Continue to Promote the Reunification of the
Motherland."
</P>
<P>
Premier Li made the remarks at a forum here today to mark the
first anniversary of Jiang's speech. He explained that the speech
expounded on Deng Xiaoping's idea of "reunifying the motherland
peacefully and one country, two systems", and analyzed the Taiwan
question and how to settle it in an objective way.
</P>
<P>
It reflects the consistency and continuity of the policy of the
Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese government on settling the
Taiwan question, he said.
</P>
<P>
"It also embodies our determination and sincerity in improving
relations across the Taiwan Straits and promoting the
reunification of the motherland," he added.
</P>
<P>
According to Li, the first proposition stated by President
Jiang, "adhering to the principle of "one China", is the basis and
premise of peaceful reunification. It is the nucleus of the eight
propositions that "China's sovereignty and territory must never be
allowed to be divided."
</P>
<P>
He said that the Chinese people oppose any words or deeds bent
on creating "independence of Taiwan," and working to "split the
country and rule under separate regimes," or create "two Chinas
over a certain period of time," which all violate the principle of
"one China".
</P>
<P>
Because of reasons that are obvious to all, the Chinese
mainland and Taiwan are not reunified yet, but Taiwan is an
integral part of China and China enjoys indisputable sovereignty
over Taiwan, he emphasized.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the fallacy "splitting the two sides of the
Taiwan Straits and ruling under separate regimes" put forward by
the Taiwan authorities means advocating the fallacy that China's
sovereignty is already divided.

<HEADLINE> China, Argentina to Step up Exchanges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, January 29 (Xinhua) -- China and Argentina agreed
today that there are broad prospects for friendly cooperation
between them and that the two countries should step up their
exchange of experience in developing the economy.
</P>
<P>
The two countries affirmed the need of sharing each other's
experience when visiting Chinese Vice Premier Zhu Rongji met with
Argentine President Carlos Menem at the latter's office this
morning.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said economic and trade exchanges between China and
Argentina will continue to expand as the economies of the two
countries are mutually complementary.
</P>
<P>
While China is rich in manpower and possesses great market
potential, Argentina abounds in natural resources, the Chinese
vice premier said.
</P>
<P>
Each can provide many products which the other needs, he added.
</P>
<P>
Menem expressed agreement with Zhu and spoke highly of China's
achievements in reform and the drive of opening to the outside
world.
</P>
<P>
The Argentine president reiterated that his country will
continue to pursue a one China policy.
</P>
<P>
Apart from bilateral relations, Zhu and Menem also discussed
major world issues of mutual concern.
</P>
<P>
Both leaders expressed satisfaction at the cooperation in
international affairs between China and Argentina, and said such
cooperation and mutual support should continue.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Zhu also met with Argentine business leaders
and briefed them of China's reform and opening progress.
</P>
<P>
On the same morning, pertinent Chinese and Argentine parties
signed the minutes on China's assistance in building a soda plant
in Argentina and an agreement on China's provision of a loan for
Argentina's La Rioja province to purchase machinery equipment.
</P>
<P>
Zhu and his delegation left here today for a four-day visit to
Chile. He will also visit Uruguay and Germany.

<HEADLINE> Deregulation to Boost Car Industry in Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 30 (Xinhua) -- The new package of deregulation
measures announced by the Indonesian government last Friday will
boost the local automotive industry, the Indonesian Automotive
Industry Association predicted today.
</P>
<P>
The deregulation is timely because it will strengthen the
structure of the country's car component industry, it said.
</P>
<P>
The deregulation measures, mostly designed to boost
export-oriented activities, include the removal of tariffs and
surcharges on the import of machinery and equipment for automotive
plants.
</P>
<P>
The association quoted its chairman Herman Z. Latif as saying
that the new measures would encourage local car component
manufacturers to strengthen their business activities through
restructuring.
</P>
<P>
According to a noted mobile businessman Yongkie Sugiarto, the
measures might also lure foreign car manufacturers to open
component plants in the country.
</P>
<P>
At present, domestic car prices are billed as the highest in
the world due to the high taxes imposed on vehicles' import and
sale.
</P>
<P>
According to local car assemblers, at least 65 percent of the
vehicle price goes to the government's coffers in the forms of
taxes.

JAKARTA, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian company PT Grahamas
Intitirta's entry into the local mineral water market has
intensified competition in the business.
</P>
<P>
According to company sources, the company's plant in Kuningan,
West Java, is capable of producing 18 liters of mineral water per
second.
</P>
<P>
The company also plans to cooperate with Cameron Spring, an
Indiana-based mineral water corporation in the United States, to
market its products worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Data from the Indonesian Bottled Drinking Water Association
showed that competition between packaged mineral water producers
is tightening.
</P>
<P>
The number of mineral water producers reached 125 in 1991 from
one in 1973. Currently 195 mineral water companies are operating
in 19 provinces of Indonesia.

</P>
<P>
At a news briefing, both Chinese and British JLG representative

Wang Weiyang said that at present, Hong Kong is involved with

the treaties can be applied in Hong Kong after 1997.
</P>
<P>
He said that since the treaties will affect various sectors in
Hong Kong, including investment, customs, trade, finance, tourism,
shipping, culture and sports, they are very important to Hong
Kong's prosperity and stability as well as to its development in
future.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the transition of the treaties is also important
to the handover of political power and the smooth transition of
Hong Kong.

issue and that he hopes the issue will be soon settled with the
joint efforts from the two sides.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAEN, Spain, January 29 (Xinhua/OANA) -- Reigning world women's
chess champion Xie Jun of China will play the blacks in the opener
of the world chess championship against Hungarian challenger
Zsuzsa Polgar, according to the drawing here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
But that didn't mean much disadvantage for Xie and could be a
lucky sign for the 25-year-old, her coach and a Chinese chess
official said.
</P>
<P>
"Despite that Polgar has the whites to place her piece first in
the opening board, she doesn't win much advantage over Xie,
tactically or psychologically," said Xie's coach, Grand master Ye
Jiangchuan.
</P>
<P>
"Xie likes to having the blacks in the first game of
multi-board competition," Ye added. "As long as Xie forces a draw
with Polgar in the first board, she will have far less pressure in
the next boards."
</P>
<P>
Chinese Chess Association president Sun Lianzhi said Xie had
winning connection with the blacks in the past competitions.
</P>
<P>
Of the latest 13 drawings, Xie has 12 black lots, including her
first successful title defence against Nana Ioseliani of Georgia
in the 1993 world championship, Sun said.
</P>
<P>
The only time she had the whites was in 1991 when Xie dethroned
Maya Chiburdanidze, also of Georgia, to take the world title.
</P>
<P>
Polgar, who could speak Spanish, predicted they might have to
fight to the 15th board before the winner comes out."
</P>
<P>
"My rating is little higher than Xie," said Polgar, who beat
Chiburdanidze last March to become the challenger. "But that
doesn't mean I will win."
</P>
<P>
The competition will begin here Tuesday afternoon.

KATHMANDU, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Asian Development Bank(ADB)
funded projects in Nepal have achieved remarkable performance in
recent years, according to the bank.
</P>
<P>
The ADB office in Nepal said Monday that the improved

important measures taken by the Nepali government in recent years.

Adequate budget allocation for priority development projects, a

projects were some of the positive steps taken by the Nepali
government to improve the implementation performance of assisted
projects in the country, the ADB said.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1995, there were 29 ongoing ADB-funded projects
in the public sector in Nepal with a total net loan of 637 million
us dollars and the bank has also invested 50 million dollars in
four private projects.
</P>
<P>
The ADB began its assistance to Nepal in 1968 and so far it has
provided 78 loans amounting to 1.2 billion dollars in this
Himalayan country.
</P>
<P>
The bank has provided assistance to Nepal in the fields of
agriculture, education, health and population, transport,
communications, hydropower, water supply and urban development.

<HEADLINE> Rare Relics in 1,000-year-old Porcelain Kiln Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Black-glaze porcelain of 800
years ago has been found in the largest porcelain-making site in
northern China.
</P>
<P>
Chinese archaeologists say that the porcelain, which includes
jars, vases, pitchers, plates, and toys, appears new and has
sparkling blue spots in its black glaze.
</P>
<P>
They say that black-glazed porcelain is rarely found among
items from that period, the Jin (1115-1234), and this is among the
best of ancient Chinese porcelain.
</P>
<P>
The porcelain was found at the Gangwayao Porcelain Kiln site,
some 50 km southwest of Chifeng City, in north China's Inner
Mongolia Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Experts say the area is rich in coal deposits and kaolin, the
material to make porcelain, which has made the site the largest
porcelain-making center for some 1,000 years, since the Liao
Dynasty (916-1125).
</P>
<P>
Sites of kilns and porcelain fragments, some piled as much as
three meters high, can still be found there.
</P>
<P>
Last year, archaeologists excavated some 180 sq m at the site
and unearthed remains of five stoves, one workshop, 20 rubbish
pits, and hundreds of pieces of porcelain and porcelain-making
tools.

<HEADLINE> "Two-Poll Theory" Raised to Solve Dhaka's Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, January 30 (Xinhua) -- A new formula of "two-election
theory -- one election for another" has been raised in a bid to
reach a long-term solution to Bangladesh's political impasse over
whether a caretaker government should be set up.
</P>
<P>
According to diplomatic sources, the formula was raised by
western diplomats who were involved in recent but failed
negotiations between Bangladesh's ruling party and the opposition.
</P>
<P>
They are now trying to convince all quarters to accept the
"two-poll theory", the sources said, adding that some western
embassies such as the United States and Britain have communicated
their views to the opposition leaders.
</P>
<P>
No details about the formula were available, but it was
reported that the western missions had advised the opposition not
to observe strikes on February 15, the polling date, to allow the
people to exercise their right of franchise without any fear of
coercion, violence or intimidation.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh's Election Commission have decided to hold the 6th
parliamentary elections on February 15 although the mainstream
opposition parties have boycotted the polls process. The ruling
Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) has been ready for a unilateral
elections with participation of some small political parties.
</P>
<P>
If the opposition parties allowed the election to be held
peacefully and the voters response fell short of government's
expectations, it would help them to urge the government to hold
the next elections soon through necessary amendment to the
constitution in line with the demand of the opposition, the
sources said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the concerned western diplomats warned that if the
opposition called strikes on the election day the government would
find an excuse to justify poor voter turnout.
</P>
<P>
It was learnt that the opposition leaders had discussed the
issue among themselves but were yet to take a firm decision about
the strike on February 15.
</P>
<P>
The diplomats raised the issue during a discussion but did not
try to impose anything on the opposition parties, an opposition
leader confirmed, saying that during the discussion, he made it
clear to the envoys that the opposition would not accept any
direction from the friendly countries regarding their program of
movement.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Colombo Port Gears Up for New Challenges  (By Hu Guangyao) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, January 30 (Xinhua) -- The port of Colombo, one of the
best in South Asia, is gearing itself to become a hub in the
region in competition with highly developed ports such as
Singapore and Hong Kong, port authorities say.
</P>
<P>
Many facilities in the port have been improved to meet
increasing demand mainly in the commercial and marketing spheres,
Daya Wijesekera, Information Secretary of the Ministry of Ports
and Shipping, told Xinhua in a recent interview.
</P>
<P>
Congestion had plagued the port of Colombo, keeping away many
main lines and feeder lines from calling at Colombo for several
years. However, this situation was improved last year, he said.
</P>
<P>
Efforts were made to achieve the targeted turnover of 5.5
billion rupees (110 million US dollars) in 1995, with an all-time
record of one million TEU being handled within the year.
</P>
<P>
Computer services at the port have been improved. The available
facilities have been upgraded. A yard operation computer system
was incorporated to optimize container handling operations.
</P>
<P>
A Further Extended Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) facility
was introduced for the port users.
</P>
<P>
It was possible to attract motor vehicles for transshipment
through Colombo from manufacturing countries such as India, Japan
and Malaysia to the Middle East and Europe.
</P>
<P>
Positive steps have been taken to bring about an awareness
among the port officials and workers that the port industry is
essentially a service-oriented commercial organization where the
subject of marketing takes the leading role, Wijesekera said.
</P>
<P>
He said that plans are afoot to further develop the Colombo
port. Under the plans, two distinct areas -- structural
development and marketing of the port in an aggressive and updated
manner have been identified.
</P>
<P>
In structural development, Wijesekera said, a modern container
terminal is under construction and the whole construction will be
will be completed in a year or two. The container terminal will
have two Post Panamax berths with a yard having enough space to
store 1.2 million containers.
</P>
<P>
The port will also be equipped with 4 Post Panama Gantry
Cranes, 12 new transfer cranes and 39 terminal tractors and
trailers this year.
</P>
<P>
Dredging has also commenced at the main entrance and exit
channel to make it 15 meters in depth to accommodate the 4th
generation Post Panamax vessels.
</P>
<P>
In the sphere of marketing of the port among the users,
Wijesekera said that a new updated and sophisticated brochure
carrying all data had been prepared and distributed.
</P>
<P>
Studies on the container output of neighboring countries have
been done in depth together with the potential growth of industry
and also the future development of other native ports.
</P>
<P>
In this process, the Indian subcontinent was identified as the
most logical immediate marketing segment which should be tapped.
</P>
<P>
Container traffic in Colombo, which currently handles more than
90,000 containers a month, is projected to reach 70 percent of its
total cargo in the next three years from just over 50 percent at
present.
</P>
<P>
With improved facilities and services , the Colombo Port is
expected to be able to meet the challenges of the 21st century,
Wijesekera said.

and its leaders are only leaders of a region in China," Chinese

</P>
<P>
"It will lead nowhere if some people attempt to use the change
of Taiwan leaders as an excuse to put their separatist activities
in a legal guise," Li said.
</P>
<P>
"Any foreign anti-Chinese power that tries to use it as a
pretext to interfere in China's internal affairs will also be
firmly opposed by the Chinese government and all the Chinese
people," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Any attempt to put the interests of Taiwanese compatriots
against the interests of the Chinese nation as a whole is doomed
to failure," he went on to say.

People's Political Consultative Conference, and Liu Huaqing,

<P>
DHAKA, January 30 (Xinhua) -- A devastating fire, the second in
two months, early this morning gutted almost half of the
newly-constructed Bangabazar market, Dhaka's biggest shopping
center in the downtown area.
</P>
<P>
Sources confirmed that the fire started from the north side of
the market at 00:15 a.m. It burned cheerfully as the flame leaked
through the tin shed shops one after another.
</P>
<P>
Hapless shop-owners wailed as the blaze spread from the east
side to the southern part of the market, the sources said, adding
that more than three dozens of ill-equipped fire brigade units
rushed to the spot from different stations in the city but could
not extinguish the fire till 01:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
The origin of the fire could not be ascertained immediately.
</P>
<P>
Last November 27, a big fire razed the market to the ground.
Cloths and assets worth about two billion tk (about 50 million US
dollars) were devoured by the fire.
</P>

<HEADLINE> France Ends Nuclear Testing, Commits to Nuclear-free Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 29 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac,
who Monday announced a permanent end to French nuclear testing,
said France will soon sign a treaty to create a nuclear-free zone
in the South Pacific.
</P>
<P>
The Rarotonga Treaty, or the South Pacific Nuclear-Free Zone
Treaty, was put forward by Australia and endorsed by members of
the South Pacific Forum in 1985.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Chirac announced in a televised address that France
had ended the tests in the South Pacific after six underground
blasts over the last five months.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued this evening at the Elysee Palace, Chirac
said, "The last series of tests which has just ended completely
fulfilled the objective of guaranteeing for the future the safety
and the reliability of the French deterrent. "
</P>
<P>
Chirac's announcement of the conclusion of nuclear testing came
two days after an underground blast at the Fangataufa Atoll in
French Polynesia on Saturday, the sixth of a series which France
had earlier said could be the last or one of the last two in
series.
</P>
<P>
French Defense Minister Charles Millon said earlier Monday that
all six tests had been "particularly successful scientifically"
and that he trusted French scientists would be ready to begin
simulating nuclear tests in a laboratory within months.
</P>
<P>
France carried out its first nuclear test of an atom bomb in
the Sahara desert in Algeria on February 13, 1960 before the north
African country won independence from French colonial rule in July
1962.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 36 years, France carried out 210 nuclear tests in
the Sahara and in French Polynesia.

<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, January 29 (Xinhua) -- A 28 year-old woman has
given birth to a 7.2 kilogram baby girl in a maternity-children's
hospital in Chetumal, a city of southeastern Mexico, the local
press reported today.
</P>
<P>
According to the doctors who took care of the woman,
Mrs. Patricia Perea Vidal, this kind of delivery is very rare and
no other case has been recorded before in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
Vidal has had similar experiences before since her first two
children were born weighing four and 5.5 kilograms respectively.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Nicolas Saurez Guerrero, the hospital gynaecologist, said
that the phenomenon of "megasomatic" babies is usually related to
diabetes. The disease causes the fetus to increase its weight
considerably.
</P>
<P>
But the case of Mrs. Vidal is different because she was not
diagnosed as a diabetic.
</P>
<P>
The report said medical studies will be carried out on the
mother and the baby girl.
</P>
<P>
"Fetal megasoma" occurs in five out of every 100 pregnant women
but generally the baby reaches an average weight of five
kilograms.

<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, January 29 (Xinhua) -- The Chilean government said
today it is satisfied with the approval by the Council of
Ministers of the European Union of the guidelines for the
negotiation on an agreement with Chile.
</P>
<P>
A Chilean Foreign Ministry communique said Monday that
the act confirms the will of the EU member nations to strengthen
their ties with Chile.
</P>
<P>
The Chilean government stressed that the strengthening of
contacts is being made "through the negotiation of a new bilateral
agreement to establish an EU-Chilean association of a political
and economic nature as its final objective."
</P>
<P>
This decision was made a few days after the signing of a
political statement in Madrid in December through which the EU
and Chile expressed their desire to move toward their objective
of forming an association.
</P>
<P>
On that occasion, they decided to hold a political dialogue at
the highest level.
</P>
<P>
The European Parliament approved a resolution on January 19,
fully backing the proposal of the EU Commission and the Council of
Ministers to negotiate a new agreement with Chile.
</P>
<P>
This agreement, including a fortified political dialogue and
vigorous trade cooperation, will be negotiated during the next few
months.
</P>
<P>
These actions will enable Chile and the EU to prepare the
progressive and reciprocal liberalization of trade in goods and
services, taking into account the sensitiveness of several
products and in accordance with the World Trade Organization (WTO)
regulations.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Trade Port for Landlocked Shanxi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, January 30 (Xinhua) -- A customs house, believed to be
the most comprehensive in north China, was opened recently in this
capital of Shanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
The new facilities at the only land port in the province are
expected to improve the movement of goods not only of Shanxi but
also of neighbouring regions in north China.
</P>
<P>
Foreign trade in inland Shanxi was previously handled of
necessity through the port of Tianjin which is several hundreds
miles away. An international container company jointly founded by
a local transportation company and a container company in Tianjin
in 1993 had to some extent alleviated the pressures caused by fast
growing foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
The new port facility however, which was a key State project
costing 26 million yuan (3.13 million US dollars), was designed to
handle 500,000 tons of goods and storage of 300,000 tons of goods,
and will be linked to the Taiyuan-Jiuguan Super Highway to be
completed in June this year.
</P>
<P>
Shanxi has already formed trade ties with over 100 countries
and regions in the world, and has an annual foreign trade volume
worth some one billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Shanxi opened its air port for foreign trade in August 1993.

<HEADLINE> Rominger Aims to Stop Indurain in Tour de France </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, January 29 (Xinhua) -- One-hour world record holder
Toni Rominger has the ambition to savour the crown of the Tour de
France for the first time before quitting from the sport at the
end of the year.
</P>
<P>
Started his professional career 10 years ago, the 34-year-old
Swiss veteran hoped most to break the five-year dominance by
Spaniard Miguel Indurain in the event.
</P>
<P>
"I just want to win the Tour," Rominger said, adding that "If
Indurain finishes second it's worth even more."
</P>
<P>
In 1993, Rominger came in second next to Indurain in the tour,
dropped out in 1994 due to stomach problems, and finished eighth
last year.
</P>
<P>
However, the Swiss national thought he has the capability to
beat Indurain in the prestigious race, saying that "I know I can
win the Tour de France, I showed it in 1993."
</P>
<P>
In his 10-year career, Rominger has won 106 races, including
three-straight wins in the Tour of Spain from 1992 to 1994 and the
Tour of Italy in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Besides, he also set the one-hour record of 53.832 kilometers
in Bordeaux in October 1994 and increased it to 55.291 two weeks
later.

<P>
SAN JOSE, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Mexico and Central America
will seek the establishment of new political and economic ties
that will serve as a base for their relations in the 21st century
during a summit to be held in San Jose next month.
</P>
<P>
"There is no other country in America with which we can form
such a close and natural alliance," Luis Guillermo Solis, a Costa
Rican Foreign Ministry official who is in charge of the summit
preparations, told Xinhua today.
</P>
<P>
Mexico and five Central American countries -- Costa Rica, El
Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua, met in Tuxtla
Gutierrez, Mexico, in 1991 under very different circumstances when
Mexico had not signed the free trade agreement with the United
States and Canada and Central America had not managed to put an
end to its civil wars.
</P>
<P>
Mexico has had a free trade agreement with Costa Rica since
1995 and seeks similar agreements with Nicaragua, El Salvador,
Guatemala and Honduras. It has been decided that a free trade zone
is to be set up this year.
</P>
<P>
Solis said Mexico is extremely important for the region as it
is a member of the Group of Three, also formed by Colombia and
Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
"Our goal," the Costa Rican official added, "is to build a
common political space with Mexico that will multiply the
advantages of the region. The president of Panama and the prime
minister of Belize, both of whom were not at the first meeting,
will attend the San Jose meeting together with the presidents
of the five Central American countries.
</P>
<P>
The summit will focus on the establishment of a privileged
relation between the two zones through the mechanism of permanent
consultations and cooperation in capital markets, investments and
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
It will pave the way for the strengthening of political ties
through the establishment of permanent mechanisms, a process that,
according to Solis, "is unprecedented in Latin America."

SHANGHAI, January 30 (Xinhua) --A white lipped deer in the
Shanghai Zoo was frightened by a helicopter last Friday and died
as a result of it, according to Shanghai's "Xinmin Evening News".

<P>
The helicopter was doing aerial photography and was flying low
above the zoo, around 10 am, and dipped down to the tips of trees

</P>
<P>
Many herbivorous animals in the zoo were frightened by the
helicopter, and one white-lipped deer was so startled that it ran
into a wall, killing itself.
</P>
<P>
The white-lipped deer, found only in China, is under the

GUANGZHOU, January 30 (Xinhua) -- The growth of the retail
price index in south China's Guangdong Province has slowed down
thanks to inflation curbing measures in 1995.

percentage points lower than the target set by the provincial
government and 3.2 percentage points lower than the national
average, a local government official announced here today.

<P>
This is the result of close monitoring and tightened

monitoring centers to watch price fluctuations of 100 major
commodities and standardized prices of grain, edible oils, meat,
vegetables, medicine, chemical fertilizer, and electricity.
</P>
<P>
It also put a stop to arbitrary charges of 1,094 items and
launched three large-scale price checks. Other measures included a

SHANGHAI, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Farmers in Shanghai's Pudong

<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Researchers at the Hangzhou
Sanitarium of China Eastern Airlines have developed a set of
special eyeglasses that provide protection against ultraviolet
rays with certain length wave.
</P>
<P>
The glasses are useful for pilots to avoid eye damage from the
strong ultraviolet light that is found at high altitudes.
</P>
<P>
According to researchers, people in planes are subject to twice
the amount of ultraviolet radiation as those on the ground, and
the rays are especially harmful to pilots and crew members of
airlines, who spend over 600 hours annually in the air.
</P>
<P>
The window glass commonly used by planes and that of eyeglasses
fails to absorb ultraviolet radiation, they explained, pointing
out that ultraviolet radiation is the major cause of cataracts in
human eyes.
</P>
<P>
Experts also say that the glasses can be used for a wide range
of occupations, such as drivers or those who work at high
elevations or in snow-covered places.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Sets Economic Target for This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 30 (Xinhua) -- This biggest industrial and
commercial center of China has vowed to keep this year's Gross
Domestic Product growth rate above 12 percent, control the price
index within 12 percent and expand investment in fixed assets.
</P>
<P>
"Shanghai will, on the one hand, oppose seeking a reckless
speed of economic development, but, on the other, develop as fast
as it can in accordance with Deng Xiaoping's requirements for the
city," Mayor Xu Kuangdi told leading officials at a meeting.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai's economy will experience a transitory period in the
first half of the year because the country will continue to carry
out a relatively stringent economic policy and issue a series of
new policies governing the readjustment of tariffs and the
refunding of taxes in the foreign trade sector, he predicted,
adding that the city's development trend will turn for the better
in the second half of the year.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai has the advantages to develop faster than the average
growth rate of eight to nine percent nationwide, he said.
</P>
<P>
The mayor estimated that the growth rate of automobiles,
telecommunications and household electrical appliances in the city
will top 20 percent, while joint ventures here will maintain an
economic growth rate of more than 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
Besides, Shanghai-made products have good potential to explore
both domestic and international markets; the service industrys is
expected to grow at last year's level; and supplies of electricity
and other major manufacturing resources can be guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
Judging from all these good signs, an economic growth rate of
10 percent to 12 percent is possible, he said, adding that the
city should strive for an economic growth rate of 13 percent.
</P>
<P>
The mayor said that Shanghai plans to invest 156 billion yuan
(about 18.8 billion US dollars) in fixed assets, slightly above
the figure for last year.
</P>
<P>
Such an investment scale is necessary for the development of
the Pudong New Area and the needs of the city's construction.
</P>
<P>
In order to get adequate funds, the city plans to make full use
of bank loans and foreign investment, and improve the investment
efficiency.
</P>
<P>
It is a key task for Shanghai to bring the price index under 12
percent this year, Xu said, adding that greater efforts will be
made to control price hikes and to intensify the reform of the
price system.

<P>
MADRID, January 29 (Xinhua) -- In order to stay in Spain for
better prospect, some South American soccer players are ready to
take Spanish nationality, local reports said.
</P>
<P>
El Pais said on Monday that about 20 South American players
were harbouring the idea, trigged off by the recent Bosman ruling
from the European Court of Justice.
</P>
<P>
The Court of Justice ruled that teams in the European Union can
field as many EU nationals as they wish where they were limited to
three previously.
</P>
<P>
However, the issue of South Americans turning into Europeans
will be discussed by the European Football Union (UEFA) on
February 7 in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
Under Spanish law, any South American can take Spanish
nationality after two years' residency in the nation.
</P>
<P>
Those South American top stars in Spain included Brazilians
Bebeto and Donato at Deportivo La Coruna, Argentina's Juan Pizzi
at Tenerife and Chilean ace Ivan Zamorano at champions Real
Madrid.

<HEADLINE> DPRK Opposes S. Korean Nuclear Construction Near MDL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, January 30 (Xinhua) -- The Korean Anti-Nuke Peace
Committee on Monday urged South Korea to give up its plan of
building large-scale nuclear facilities near the Military
Demarcation Line (MDL).
</P>
<P>
The committee said in a statement that accidental conflicts
around the projected facilities may lead to a nuclear scourge if
nuclear power plants and nuclear waste dumps are built on the
eastern coast of the Korean Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
South Korea plans to build nuclear power plants and waste dumps
in Kosong County of its Kangwon Province, which is close to the
demarcation line separating the DPRK and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
The committee argued that the South Korean plan runs counter to
both international practices and poses a threat to the environment
and security of the region.
</P>
<P>
It warned that to build nuclear facilities in a place where the
South Koreans often conduct military exercises is a provocation
which endangers the safety of the Democratic People's Republic of
Korea and the safety of the entire Korean nation.
</P>
<P>
On January 26, the DPRK Committee for the Peaceful
Reunification of the Fatherland also appealed to South Korea to
give up its planned nuclear facility construction near the MDL
area.

CANBERRA, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Organizers of the Australian
Open tennis tournament received an anonymous phone call
threatening the life of American player Monica Seles before her
women's singles final, a newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Melbourne-based Herald Sun said organizers received the
call on Friday night but they did not tell Seles in order not to
distract her from Saturday's final, which she eventually won over
German Anke Huber in straight sets.
</P>
<P>
"Secrecy was crucial because of the possible ramifications had
Seles become aware of the threat," the newspaper quoted tournament
director Paul McNamee as saying.
</P>
<P>
But security was beefed up around the tennis star with one
uniformed police officer added to each entrance of the stadium,
the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
In 1993, Seles was stabbed in the back by a fan of German
player Steffi Graf during a tournament in Hamburg, Germany.
</P>

She was out of the WTA circuit for 28 months before returning
last year to win the Canadian Open in Montreal.

MOSCOW, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Lithuanian President Algirdas
Brazaukas today signed an order to force Prime Minister Adolfas
Shlezhyavichius to resign, the Itar-Tass News Agency reported.

state banks prior to a banking crisis which took place last

exports will rise.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Northeast China's Liaoning
Province plans to introduce foreign experts to undertake 6,000
projects in the next 15 years, according to the provincial
government.
</P>
<P>
An official of the Provincial Department of Foreign Trade and

The introduction of foreign intellectual resources will take
such forms as employing foreign experts for short periods,
encouraging foreign experts to contribute their expertise as
shares and encouraging foreign experts to contract for
technological upgrading projects.
</P>
<P>
The province will also set up personnel training centers in a
number of key universities and colleges in Germany, Japan, the
United States, Singapore, Canada and Hong Kong, the official said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the provincial government will earmark 30 million
yuan a year to establish an international personnel training fund

<P>
Meanwhile, 4,000 enterprise personnel such as managers, senior
engineers, chief accountants and lawyers will be sent abroad for
training, he said.
</P>
<P>
The invitation of foreign experts and the training program for
local enterprise personnel are intended to train senior managers
able to participate in global competition, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The introduction of foreign intellectual resources focuses on
upgrading state-run enterprises during the 1996-2010 period in
Liaoning, a heavy industrial center in China, the official said.

<HEADLINE> China's Nuclear Industry Readjustment Successful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 30 (Xinhua) -- China's nuclear industry has
undergone a historical structural readjustment, with its
production for civilian use accounting for 80 percent of its total
output value now, as compared with five percent in 1980,
statistics show.
</P>
<P>
The country's nuclear industry is developing in accordance with
the principle of "combining military production with civilian
production, taking nuclear industry as the basis while developing
nuclear power and promoting a diversified economy," according to
the China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC).
</P>
<P>
From 1955 to the late 1970s China's nuclear industry was mainly
confined to military production. After that, the country began to
introduce the reform and open policies, and started to shift the
industry from military production to civilian production, with the
emphasis on the peaceful application of nuclear energy and nuclear
technology.
</P>
<P>
At present, the industry's three pillar sectors are the
development of nuclear power stations, nuclear fuel and a
diversified economy, the CNNC said.
</P>
<P>
In the Eighth Five-Year Plan period (1991-1995) a number of
projects involving the production of fertilizers, magnesium,
titanium dioxide, electrolytic aluminum and rare earth have gone
into operation, providing many job opportunities for people made
redundant by the closing of military facilities.
</P>
<P>
From 1986 to 1995 the industry launched over 300 projects for
shifting military technology to civilian use. Of these, 12
projects with investment of over 100 million yuan (about 12
million US dollars) each have been basically completed.
</P>
<P>
In the 1991-1995 period the output value of civilian products
in the industry grew at an annual rate of 38.3 percent, statistics
indicate.
</P>
<P>
In 1995 the output value generated from the diversified
economic production in the industry reached nearly four billion
yuan, and the industry's exports increased 12 percent over 1994.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Trade Propels Shanghai Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 30 (Xinhua)-- Foreign trade has become a
major driving force for the economic growth of this largest
industrial city in China, according to a senior municipal official.
</P>
<P>
"Foreign trade has contributed a great deal to the sustained,
rapid and healthy development of the Shanghai economy," Mayor Xu
Kuangdi told a recent meeting on foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
In the Eighth Five-Year Plan period (1991-1995), Shanghai's
exports grew by an average of 16.84 percent, 2.8 percentage points
higher than that for the city's overall economy.
</P>
<P>
Xu noted that the export industry was greatly outgrown by the
overall economy in Shanghai during the period 1979 to 1989, by
4.72 percent to 7.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that Shanghai's foreign trade totalled 11.58
billion US dollars-worth last year, making it one of the city's
six pillar industries. Among the largest export items last year
were electronics products, automobiles, machinery, electrical
appliances and sewing machines.
</P>
<P>
Xu said that exports, together with investment, accounted for
more than 65 percent of the city's economic growth between 1991
and 1995.
</P>
<P>
The mayor stressed that no efforts should be spared to
accelerate the growth of exports, saying that "the major role of
foreign trade in the municipal economy must be given full scope".

<HEADLINE> UN Renews Mandate of Observer Mission in Liberia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 29 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council on Monday extended the mandate an 82-member observer
mission in Liberia, until May 31, 1996.
</P>
<P>
In adopting the resolution unanimously, the council called upon
all Liberian parties to respect and implement fully and
expeditiously all the agreements and commitments they had already
entered into.
</P>
<P>
The mandate renew was suggested by U.N. Secretary-General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali notwithstanding the recent setbacks in the
country's peace process.
</P>
<P>
Boutros-Ghali pointed out that under the Abuja Agreement, the
elections can be scheduled to be held before the end of August
1996.
</P>
<P>
He expected that the Liberian National Transitional Government
and faction leaders will provide their full cooperation to the
West African States Monitoring Group and U.N. Observer Mission in
stablizing the situation.
</P>
<P>
Three main parties of Liberia signed the Abuja Agreement in
August, 1995, which obliged them to realize ceasefire,
disarmament, demobilization and peace process within a specific
framework. The agreement was widely regarded as a beginning of the
end of the six-year civil war.
</P>
<P>
However, the attacks undertaken by General Roosevelt Johnson's
wing of the United Liberian Movement of Liberia for democracy on
the ECOMOG earlier this month cast doubt on the implementation of
the agreement. ECOMOG has reported that it suffered 94 casualties
as a result of the incident.
</P>
<P>
In the resolution, the council condemned the recent armed
attacks against personnel of ECOMOG and against civilians, and
demands that such hostile acts cease forthwith.
</P>
<P>
It also urged all member states to provide financial,
logistical and other assistance in support of ECOMOG to enable it
to carry out its mandate, particularly with respect to disarmament
of the Liberian factions.

<HEADLINE> "Magic" Johnson Returns to NBA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 29 (Xinhua/OANA) -- U.S. superstar Earvin
"Magic" Johnson returned to professional basketball on Monday from
his retirement since 1991 when he tested positive for the AIDS
virus.
</P>
<P>
Johnson, 36, signed a contract with his old team - the Los
Angeles Lakers and was expected to play his first game on Tuesday
when the Lakers host the Golden State Warriors.
</P>
<P>
"Hey, I'm back," Johnson said, as he arrived for a team
practice. He has been practicing with the Lakers for the past two
weeks.
</P>
<P>
Lakers executive vice president Jerry West, who made the
announcement, said the basketball legend would wear his old jersey
number 32, which the team retired in an emotional ceremony nearly
three years ago.
</P>
<P>
Johnson, who revolutionized the point guard position during his
12 year career and led the Lakers to five NBA championship titles
during the 1980s, would likely play power forward at the beginning
of his return.
</P>
<P>
"I know I'm not in NBA shape, that will probably take three or
four weeks," the 2.46-meter point guard said last Friday amid
speculations that he would rejoin the Lakers. "But I'm in good
enough shape to play."
</P>
<P>
Johnson has been playing with his own touring all-star team
since he retired just before the 1991-1992 season.
</P>
<P>
"It's an exciting day, obviously, for everybody," Lakers coach
Del Harris said. "There's no doubt the players are looking forward
to playing with him on a real basis."
</P>
<P>
Unconfirmed reports from Los Angeles said Johnson's new
contract with the Lakers will pay him 2.5 million dollars for the
rest of the season.
</P>
<P>
Lon Rosen, Johnson's agent, said Johnson will decide after this
season what he wants to do next. "His touring team will postpone
its tour," Rosen said.
</P>
<P>
Johnson's return to NBA will make him the first American
athlete admittedly carrying the HIV virus to play professional
sports.

WASHINGTON, January 29 (Xinhua) -- The Syrian-Israeli peace

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 29 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Security Council today demanded that all concerned in Burundi
exercise restraint and refrain from acts of violence.
</P>
<P>
In a resolution adopted unanimously today, the council called
upon all concerned in Burundi to participate in a positive spirit
and without delay in a comprehensive political dialogue to promote
national reconciliation, democracy, security and the rule of law
in the country.
</P>
<P>
The political situation in Burundi has been turbulent and
unstable with thousands of people killed since October 1993.
</P>
<P>
Expressing deep concern at the deterioration in the situation
in Burundi, the Security Council condemned in the strongest terms
those responsible for the increasing violence, including against
refugees and international humanitarian personnel.
</P>
<P>
The council also invited member states and others concerned to
cooperate in the identification and dismantling of radio stations
which incite hatred and acts of violence in Burundi.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Security Council today, Chinese Ambassador Qin
Huasun said that the Chinese government and people have all along
following closely the developments in Burundi and deeply
sympathized with the people of Burundi in their sufferings.
</P>
<P>
"We have taken an active part in the U.N. efforts on the
question of Burundi and provided material assistance within our
capacity to Burundi through bilateral channels," he said.
</P>
<P>
As the final settlement of the question of Burundi must rely on
the Burundi people themselves, Qin urged the parties in the
country to start broadly-based dialogue as soon as possible and
implement in real earnest the relevant resolutions of the council.

in new york recently over that country's name issue.

another big power in the world, were "developing on all levels

potential for Greece and Cyprus in the South Eastern
Mediiterranean."
</P>
<P>
On the country's defense policy, the premier said the target of
the policy remains the prevention of any foreign military threat
against Greece and Cyprus."

<P>
Greece, he stressed, was participating in the new adjustment
process of NATO and western European Union alliance on the new
order.
</P>
<P>

priorities included revision of the constitution, meritocracy in

<HEADLINE> Two Million Nigerians Receive River Blindness Treatment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 29 (Xinhua) -- Two million river blindness
(onchocersiasis) sufferers in Nigeria's 20 endemic states
received treatment in 1995, said a report released today by the
health ministry.
</P>
<P>
The treatment is part of the achievements made under the
National Onchocerciasis Control Program, which is aimed at
checking the transmission of the disease, currently afflicting
about five million people.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Jonathan Jiya, co-ordinator of the project, said today
that the patients were treated with a special oral drug supplied
free by an foreign donor company.
</P>
<P>
He said that the distribution of the drug started five years
ago and would continue for the next five years, a mandatory
period for clear an infection.
</P>
<P>
The official said a five-year plan has already been developed
for the control of the disease.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, global 2000, an international aid agency fighting
for the eradication of the guinea-worm disease, is expected to
support the Onchocerciasis Program in Nigeria from this year.
</P>
<P>
Onchocerciasis is transmitted to human beings through a
parasitic female savannah blackfly, which breeds in river
areas.
</P>
<P>
An infection can take 14 years to manifest, causing blindness,
severe debilitation and reduced life expectancy.

<HEADLINE> Clinton to Renew Calls for Russia's Continued Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 30 (Xinhua) - U.S. President Bill Clinton
will renew his call on Russia to "stay the course" on economic
reforms when he meets Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin
later today, the White House said.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Mike McCurry told a press briefing here
that Clinton would tell Chernomyrdin that "political and economic
reform can bring greater security and prosperity for the Russian
people."
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin has been in Washington since late Sunday for a
joint Russia-U.S. economic and technological cooperation meeting
and for talks with leaders of the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) on the fund's new loans to Russia in 1996.
</P>
<P>
McCurry said that there might be some announcements when
Chernomyrdin and U.S. Vice President Al Gore hold a news
conference later this afternoon at the end of the joint session.
</P>
<P>
American officials said that the United States and Russia have
agreed to expand their cooperation in such areas as space, energy,
nuclear safety and business development.
</P>
<P>
The two-day meeting between high-ranking Russian and U.S.
officials came after Clinton held a 40-minute telephone
conversation with Russian President Boris Yeltsin last Friday.
Yeltsin gave Clinton new assurances that he is firmly committed to
economic reform and a strong U.S.-Russian partnership.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin made similar public statements on Monday at the
opening of his talks with Gore and U.S. officials have viewed both
of these reassurances as significant.
</P>
<P>
But Chernomyrdin stressed that "certain corrections" were
necessary in the reform process, particularly in the social
programs.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Urges Liberian Factions To Respect Peace Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria has urged the Liberian
warring factions, especially the Johnson-led faction, which
recently attacked the west African peace-keeping force known as
ECOMOG, to give peace a chance to reign in that west African
country.
</P>
<P>
Making the appeal here today, the Director of Defence
information#,Fred Chijuka, pointed out that the factions risked
making themselves irrelevant in the Liberian peace efforts by
being intransigent and frustrating peace moves to end the six
years of civil war.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the recent action of the Ulimo faction led by
Maj.-gen. Roosevelt Johnson had only resulted in bringing
complications into the peace process, which he said was beginning
to work smoothly until the Ulimo attacked the peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
The defence spokesman stressed that if the factions continued
their intransigence, the people of Liberia might get fed up with
their actions and "say no" to any trick against the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Under a peace accord signed by all parties to the Liberian
conflict in Nigerian capital Abuja last August, a collective
presidency and a cabinet have been set up to rule Liberia till
the scheduled general elections are held next August.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, ECOMOG continued deployment in Liberia to disarm
fighters of the armed factions.
</P>
<P>
The process of disarmament had begun before the Johnson-led
Ulimo faction launched the attack on ECOMOG, killing ten and
wounding many other ECOMOG soldiers.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Calls for Solving Aegean Sea Islet Dispute with Greece through Negotiations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Turkey today demanded that
Greece withdraw its troops from Imia (Kardak) rocks in the Aegean
Sea and called for holding negotiations to solve the dispute.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish government said in a statement that Turkey is
committed to defusing, rather than increasing, tension in this
region.
</P>
<P>
Turkey said it is ready to enter into negotiations with Greece,
with a view to determining the possession of small islands, islets
and rocks in the Aegean.
</P>
<P>
The statement said "Greece issued bellicose statements on
January 28 regarding the status of the Kardak rocks, which is only
3.8 miles off the coast of Turkey in the Aegean Sea. This is yet
another example of unfounded Greek claims to sovereignty."
</P>
<P>
The statement added that "it is obvious that the possession of
the small islands, islets and rocks in the region -- the status of
which have not been clearly defined by international documents --
has yet to be determined by agreement."
</P>
<P>
Therefore, attempts by Greece to inhabit the small islands,
islets and rocks in question can in no way create any legal
consequences in regard to their status, the Turkish government
said.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Foreign Minister Deniz Baykal has summoned the Greek
ambassador in Ankara and gave him a protest note claiming the
islet belonged to Turkey and asked Greece to withdraw the 12
soldiers stationed there.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Greek Defense Minister Gerasimos
Arsenis claimed in a news conference today that "the islet of Imia
is Greek and it is the responsibility of the armed forces to
defend Greek territory."
</P>
<P>
He added that the Greek armed forces are in full readiness to
deal with any threat against Greek territory.
</P>
<P>
The escalation in tension between the two NATO members
surfaced a week ago, when a Turkish ship crashed into the twin
rock group with a total area of four hectares, which is 3.8
nautical miles away from the Turkish shore and 11 nautical miles
from the Greek island of Kalimons.
</P>
<P>
It grew worse through the remarks of Greece's new Foreign
Minister Theodoros Pangalos who said that Turkey had "claimed
Greek land for the first time."
</P>
<P>
Greece and Turkey nearly went to war in 1987 in a dispute over
mineral rights in the Aegean. They argued last year over whether
Athens has the right to extend its territorial waters in the
Aegean to 12 miles from six miles.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Protests against Increasing Turkish Military in Northern Part </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 30 (Xinhua) -- The Cyprus government today
lodged protest to the five permanent members of the United
Nations Security Council over an increase in Turkish military
equipment in the northern Turkish-controlled part of the island.
</P>
<P>
The protest was made by Foreign Minister Alecos Michaelides at
separate meetings he had with the ambassadors of the five
permanent member-states of Security Council to Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
"We have information that in the very recent past, the Turks
have brought into the occupied part of Cyprus more tanks and
additional military equipment. We have protested this move,"
Michaelides told a press conference here today.
</P>
<P>
He described this development as "a provocation" and noted
that the fresh military input is far higher than what was brought
into the country in the second half of 1995.
</P>
<P>
The Minister said the Cyprus government will also lodge a
protest with the President of the U.N. Security Council and
instructions for such protest have already been communicated to
the Republic's permanent representative at the U.N. seat.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot south and the
Turkish Cypriot north since 1974 when Turkish troops invaded and
seized northern third of the island following a Greek Cypriot
coup seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Secretary General, in his report of December 1995 on
the U.N. Peace-Keeping Force in Cyprus, described the northern
part of Cyprus as "one of the most densely militarized areas in
the world with 30,000 Turkish troops and 4,500 Turkish Cypriot
troops".
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief has also expressed "serious concern" over the
excessive level of foreign troops and of armaments on the island
and the rate at which these are being strengthened.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Urges Iran to Enter Dialogue for Normalizing Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, January 30 (Xinhua) -- Iraq today urges Iran to adopt
a positive and serious policy toward the normalization of
bilateral ties based on mutual respect for sovereignty, legitimate
rights and non-interference in each other's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's senior Foreign Undersecretary Saad al-Fasal spoke in a
statement to Iraqi News Agency, responding to Iranian Deputy
Foreign Minister Hurran's statement on Iraqi-Iranian relations
made Monday.
</P>
<P>
Fasal said Iraq's position was clear from the beginning toward
entering into a serious political dialogue to put the past
differences behind and to solve suspending issues in a positive
way.
</P>
<P>
Iraq is keen to intensify efforts in the service of both
countries' legitimate interests, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that Iraq has made a series of constructive initiatives
toward achieving the goal which is crucial for both parties and
for the security and stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi official said that some Iranian officials have been
issuing statements on contacts with Iraq which contradicts those
during the closed door talks between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
The reason behind this, he noted, is that Iranian officials
desire to manoeuvre and mix cards for political aims or to divert
attention away from the real problems.
</P>
<P>
He said that Iraq has given priority to humanitarian issues to
restore confidence between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Fasal stressed that Iraq had released all Iranian prisoners of
war (POWs) by 1990 but Iran still detains some 20,000 Iraqi POWs.
