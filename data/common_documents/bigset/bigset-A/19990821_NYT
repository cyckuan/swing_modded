   NEW YORK _ They are natives of Syria, Lebanon, Somalia, Egypt,
England and the United States. But on Friday, they all gathered to
pray amid the exposed wiring and unfinished walls of a house of
worship that they had scrimped and saved to build in midtown
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   As they thanked Allah for their own good fortune, their prayers
were for others a continent away in Turkey, a land devastated by a
huge earthquake that has taken the lives of more than 10,000 people
and left rescue workers searching through rubble for tens of
thousands more.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are all brothers, and should one of our brothers suffer, be
they in Egypt, Turkey or here, be they Muslim or just of the human
race, our heart should be soft and we must help,'' said Mohammed
Ali Abdelaal, the director of the Uthman Ben Affan Mosque on East
55th Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is the answer,'' he said. ``There is no other.''
</P>
<P>
   Similar calls were being broadcast from mosques across New York
and the rest of the country during the Friday khutba, or sermon.
With relief workers toiling against time to find survivors of
Tuesday's earthquake, and worrying about the spread of disease,
officials said billions of dollars would be needed to right the
situation once all the bodies could be pulled from the rubble and
buried.
</P>
<P>
   Several Turkish banks and Muslim organizations have set up
accounts where donations can be routed. Other groups and hospitals
are collecting medical supplies, construction equipment, mobile
toilets and tents.
</P>
<P>
   Alper Tutus, a businessman from Great Neck, N.Y., drove all the
way to the Fatih Mosque on the eastern edge of Bay Ridge to donate
to the cause. Saying he is not a religious man and never goes to
the mosque to pray, Tutus spoke through tears about the devastation
in his homeland as he dropped bills onto a donation table.
</P>
<P>
   ``My heart is bleeding,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Aly Abuzaakouk, the director of the American Muslim Council,
noted that even the Greek government, which historically has had a
fractious relationship with Turkey, has sent aid.
</P>
<P>
   ``This disaster has helped show that, despite animosities and
adversities, we are all of one human race,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That was also the message Friday at the Uthman Ben Affan Mosque.
More than 100 Sunni Muslims, members of Islam's main branch,
kneeled before Abdelaal. While implicit in Abdelaal's sermon was
the idea that such disasters are an act of God, he urged his
congregation not to think that the Turkish people had been singled
out for punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Many Muslims have been opposed to both the secular nature of the
Turkish government and its close ties with Israel. But while the
disaster might bring secular Turkey closer to its Muslim brothers,
Abdelaal said, that was not a subject to be debated now.
</P>
<P>
   The congregation understood what was being asked: Put aside your
differences and open your wallets and hearts in an act of
salvation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot say we don't care, that the government of Turkey is
corrupt, that they are too close with Israel, that they fight their
Muslim brothers, that this is thousands of miles away,'' Abdelaal
said. ``We Muslims are like a great brick wall and if you take one
brick from the wall, we will all fall down.''
</P>
<P>
   The mosque, also known as the Islamic Society of Mid-Manhattan,
has itself benefited from the generosity of others. After nine
years renting a basement space on West 44th Street, the society
collected enough donations and financing to buy and begin
renovating a new home on East 55th Street. The society moved into
its new home two months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Services are held amid exposed beams and snarled wiring, a bit
of which caught fire because of a short circuit during the
director's sermon Friday. More money will be needed to complete the
mosque. But on Friday, its members did not shy from offering what
they had to their brethren in Turkey, dropping 5, 10, and 20-dollar
bills into a special case marked for the effort.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the day, more than $1,000 had been collected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now the relief agencies say they can only take money,
but I also will give clothes if necessary,'' said Darosh Karim, a
30-year-old computer engineer who immigrated from India.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, we sent money to help in the floods in China,'' he
added. ``But wherever such disaster happens we will help. It does
not matter who is in need.''

MICHAEL SVEDA, THE INVENTOR   OF CYCLAMATES, DIES AT 87  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., Mass., The Czech Republic)   By LESLIE KAUFMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Michael Sveda, a chemist who invented cyclamates, a
noncaloric sweetener that became widely popular and then was banned
by the government as a possible carcinogen, died on Aug. 10 at his
home in Stamford, Conn. He was 87.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was complications from Parkinson's disease, said his
wife, Martha Gaeth Sveda.
</P>
<P>
   Sveda (SVAY-dah) was born on Feb. 3, 1912, in West Ashford,
Conn., the son of immigrants from Czechoslovakia.
</P>
<P>
   Sveda, who once told The New York Times in an interview that
``God looks after damn fools, children and chemists,'' credited
providence for his discovery of cyclamates. In 1937, while doing
lab work for his doctorate at the University of Illinois, he
brushed his lips without having washed his hands and found that his
fingers tasted sweet. Intrigued, he tasted chemicals from all the
beakers in front of him and discovered the compound that he
eventually refined into the sweetener.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Sveda completed that process, he was an employee of
the DuPont Co.. He received the patent in 1939, but it was not
until 1951 that the federal government approved cyclamates as a
food additive. Previously, only saccharin had been available as an
artificial sweetener, and soon a huge market developed for the
alternative product.
</P>
<P>
   By the 1960s cyclamates had become the basis of a $1 billion
business in diet soft drinks and desserts. It was an ingredient of
the one-calorie soda Tab, for example. Many diabetics wrote Sveda
to thank him for the growth of options in sweets available to them.
</P>
<P>
   In his 20 years at DuPont, Sveda worked on several other
patents, making contributions to such diverse compounds as the
pesticide DDT, nylon and mustard gas, but it was the sweetener that
held the broadest public interest.
</P>
<P>
   In 1969, however, the Department of Health, Education and
Welfare banned cyclamates from the market on the risk that
substance caused cancer. The decision was based on experiments that
showed that some rats that were fed large quantities over their
life spans developed bladder tumors. Although Sveda said he was not
embittered by the government's decision, he contended that the
experiments had not been rigorous enough to warrant the ban. In
subsequent interviews, he even suggested that the sugar industry
had used its political muscle to squelch a competitor.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father would have been the first person to say, `If this is
harmful don't use it,''' said his daughter, Sally Sveda, of Newton
Falls, Mass. ``But he felt that it was important to be accurate in
the science since there were many people who might benefit from it,
especially diabetics.''
</P>
<P>
   After the government acted, Sveda received phone calls from
people worried that they had been poisoned by the cyclamates, a
development he found frightening.
</P>
<P>
   Further government studies contradicted the findings behind the
ban. In one, by the National Cancer Institute, a group of monkeys
were fed doses of the chemical equivalent to drinking 30 cans of
artificially sweetened soda a day for 17 years, with no unusual
sign of illness.
</P>
<P>
   To this day, however, the Food and Drug Administration has not
cleared the substance for consumption in this country again, even
though it is used in products in other nations.
</P>
<P>
   In 1981, the government classified saccharin as a suspected
carcinogen but did not ban it. An advisory group recommended last
year that it be given a clean bill of health.
</P>
<P>
   After he left DuPont, Sveda worked as a consultant on management
techniques. In addition to his wife and daughter, he is survived by
a son, Michael, of Washington, and a granddaughter.

YANKEES TAKE EXTRA BATTING PRACTICE, BEAT TWINS, 9-3 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ Nearly the entire roster of the Yankees' position
players inhabited the otherwise empty Metrodome early Friday
afternoon for extra and optional batting practice, the echoes of
ball meeting bat pinballing around the place.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Jeter was there, trying to conquer his recent slump. Tino
Martinez took his turn, attempting to correct his lurching
approach. Chili Davis was the last to hit, searching for the swing
he lost a few weeks ago. Ricky Ledee and Bernie Williams were the
only members of the starting lineup who did not attend. No matter.
Hours later, they drove in all but two of the runs as the Yankees
defeated the Twins, 9-3.
</P>
<P>
   Hideki Irabu (10-4) pitched into the eighth inning and once
again, the Yankees could feel good about themselves, after
improving their record to 74-47 and finally collecting enough hits
and runs to support the strong pitching they have been getting.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of their 4-1 loss to Kansas City on Thursday, the
Yankees' batting coach, Chris Chambliss, mentioned to manager Joe
Torre that Davis wanted to take extra batting practice Friday.
Torre thought about it and mused that there probably would be a lot
of Yankees showing up.
</P>
<P>
   They had scored a total of 14 runs in the six games coming into
Friday night's, with two home runs, and while they practiced their
hitting in the afternoon, there was very little talk. The batting
cage usually is a place of laughter and joking, lots of shouting
and teasing. Not Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``They all had something to work on,'' Torre said. ``They all
had a purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees then attacked the Twins' Brad Radke with the same
singlemindedness in the first inning. Chuck Knoblauch grounded a
single through the left side, Jeter rolled a hit up the middle, and
even after Paul O'Neill hit into a double play, Williams singled
and drove in a run.
</P>
<P>
   Radke typically has great control _ he had allowed only 27 walks
in 165 innings _ but Martinez drew a five-pitch walk, and when
Davis also walked, the bases were loaded. Ledee took two pitches
out of the strike zone; now Radke had to throw a strike.
</P>
<P>
   He fired a fastball, Ledee turned on it, his front leg
straightening as he threw his bat at the ball, and soon the
Minnesota right fielder Marty Cordova was staring upward, watching
Ledee's home run fly over the giant blue tarpaulin that serves as
the top of the wall.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees had scored only one run in their previous 20
innings, and now they had five in the first.
</P>
<P>
   Williams singled home another run in the second _ Knoblauch
started the inning with a walk _ and Irabu took it from there,
striking out seven before being lifted in the eight. The Yankees
took a first step toward breaking out of their slump, but they
still have problems to address.
</P>
<P>
   One is Jeter, who went two for five Friday night and scored his
100th run of the season in the ninth. But his average is .348, down
from .371 at the All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   As he has acknowledged, Jeter has tried to pull the ball to the
left side of the field too much, rather than do what he does best:
spray the ball from line to line.
</P>
<P>
   Pitchers have always tried jamming Jeter, down and inside or up
and inside, but lately, they have been particularly effective
pitching him down and in.
</P>
<P>
   In his last 30 games, Jeter has four doubles and five homers,
after accumulating 46 extra-base hits in his first 89 games.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem involves Paul O'Neill's run production, which
has dipped significantly because of those slumping in front of him
_ including the No. 9 hitter Scott Brosius. O'Neill has three runs
batted in in his last 12 games.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, the cleanup batter, returned to the starting lineup
Friday night after missing three games with a stomach virus. ``I
feel a lot better than yesterday,'' Williams said, while picking at
some soup.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez tripled home two runs in the ninth Friday night, but he
has had a poor season, considering all the RBI chances he has had.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, Martinez has had a tendency to chase pitches low and
inside and out of the strike zone _ Minnesota and Kansas City
consistently pitched him this way during the recently completed
homestand _ and over the last 25 games, he has drawn only five
walks.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, the designated hitter, has not hit a home run in his last
13 games, and his batting average has dipped steadily. Torre is
convinced that Davis is simply tired _ maybe he should have been
rested more, Torre said _ and Davis will likely be rested
consistently in the last weeks of the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   With a single in Thursday's game against Kansas City, Brosius
ended a string of 28 hitless at-bats, the longest streak by a
Yankee since Kevin Maas went 0 for 29 in 1991. Brosius went 0-for-5
Friday night, with terrible at-bats that prompted him to flip his
bat and helmet away after the fourth one.

DR. ROBERT BYCK, EXPERT ON SMOKABLE COCAINE, DIES AT 66  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., Mass., N.J., Calif., Mo.)   By WILLIAM H. HONAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Robert Byck, a psychiatrist and brain researcher at Yale
Medical School who in 1979 gave Congress an early warning that the
United States faced an epidemic of smokable cocaine, died on Aug. 9
in a Boston hospital. He was 66 and lived in Gilford, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was complications from a stroke suffered three days
earlier, said Dr. Seth Powsner, a Yale colleague.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1970s, growing concern about the effects of
marijuana led Byck and a Yale associate, Dr. J. Murdoch Ritchie, to
test its effects on the nerves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back then,'' Powsner said, ``a lot of people thought smoking
marijuana was like getting in a hot tub, which makes you feel good
but has no direct effect on nerve cells.''
</P>
<P>
   But Byck and Ritchie were the first to show that the major
component of marijuana, tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, had a direct
effect on nerve cells and was more dangerous than previously
thought, Powsner said.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly afterward, Byck and colleagues at the Yale Medical
School began a study on the use of coca paste in Peru that led him
to predict a coming crisis in the use of smoked cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peru had not had much of a problem from coca leaves or even
powdered cocaine,'' said Dr. David F. Musto, a professor of
medicine at Yale and author of a well-known study on cocaine. ``But
Dr. Byck recognized that when coca paste is smoked, the body
rapidly takes in enormous doses of cocaine and that creates a
compulsive need for it.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, Byck testified before the House Select Committee on
Narcotics Abuse and Control. He said: ``The person who smokes coca
paste has a very intense euphoria almost immediately after he
starts smoking the cigarette. The patterns of use are compulsive
and continuous. Users become totally dependent on the drug, will do
anything to get it and may use it to the extent where they become
paranoid, are totally involved with drug taking and become social
cripples.''
</P>
<P>
   Byck said that the United States did not have an epidemic of
freebase or coca-paste smoking but that the possibility of one
strongly existed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are on the brink of a dangerous drug-use phenomenon,'' Byck
said. ``We should do something about it as rapidly as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Byck also helped to expose monosodium glutamate, or MSG, as the
additive responsible for the flush and headache of what became
known as Chinese restaurant syndrome. He did some of his research
at a restaurant near his laboratory at the Albert Einstein College
of Medicine in New York when he was a member of the pharmacology
faculty there in the late 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   ``He published a paper in 1969 that identified MSG as the
culprit,'' said Dr. John Olney, a professor of psychiatry at the
Washington University Medical School in St. Louis, whose own
research called attention to the dangers of MSG. ``Today, the
toxicity of glutamate is widely recognized and studied,'' Olney
said.
</P>
<P>
   Byck and Olney testified about their findings in 1969 before the
Senate Select Committee on Nutrition and Human Needs, and several
years later, MSG was removed from baby foods.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Byck (pronounced bick), was born in Newark. He followed
his father and older brother into medicine and received his medical
degree at the University of Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   In 1969, he went to Yale for training as a psychiatrist and
joined the faculty there. In 1977, he was made a professor of
psychiatry and pharmacology.
</P>
<P>
   Byck is survived by his second wife, Susan Wheeler Byck of
Gilford; three sons, John, of Gilford, Lucas, of Norwalk, Conn.,
and Carl, of Santa Rosa, Calif.; a daughter, Gillian Overholser of
Marblehead, Mass; a brother, Walter, of Santa Rosa, and four
grandchildren.

CLINTON, IN ROLE REVERSAL, HELPS HIS WIFE AS FUND-RAISER
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ADDS 4th and 5th grafs with details of president's speech.)  (rk) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDGARTOWN, Mass. _ For the first time in the strange odyssey of
a sitting president whose wife is seeking public office, President
Clinton stepped into the role of supportive spouse Friday night to
help Hillary Rodham Clinton build up a war chest for her likely
Senate campaign.
</P>
<P>
   At a Nantucket dinner that cost $1,000 a ticket, Mrs. Clinton
pulled in more than $100,000 in the first of numerous fund-raising
events that she plans to attend in the next two weeks during the
couple's summer vacation. She is expected to raise about $600,000
toward the more than $20 million she needs for her all-but-declared
candidacy for the Senate from New York.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 7, President Clinton started stumping for his vice
president, Al Gore, introducing him to small clutches of
fund-raisers and crowds of others. Friday night he began the same
supportive duty for his wife.
</P>
<P>
   The president regaled his audience with reminiscences of meeting
Hillary Rodham in the early 1970s at Yale Law School, where she
introduced herself to him after they had caught each other's eye.
</P>
<P>
   ``This woman has initiative,'' Clinton said Friday night, adding
that this was the first reason Clinton would be a good senator. He
also said he was grateful that she had put her career on hold for
him.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton was the star of the show as 140 people gathered at
the Nantucket home of Smith and Elizabeth Bagley, longtime
Democratic donors. Bagley is an heir to the R.J. Reynolds tobacco
fortune, and Mrs. Bagley is a former ambassador to Portugal.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's the draw,'' Mrs. Bagley said in an interview before
serving her guests a buffet dinner of chicken, Portuguese sausage,
mussels and clams at their spacious, weathered cedar-shingled home.
``There are people calling like crazy. We promised we'd help in any
way we could.''
</P>
<P>
   The guests included Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts, as well as
those with lower profiles, like several longtime island residents,
like Chuck Lenhart, an architect, Martin McGowan, a gardener, and
Paula Gonfrader, who owns a hairdressing salon. But most, Mrs.
Bagley said, are longtime Democratic donors.
</P>
<P>
   The buffet, which was closed to the press, came after the couple
spent the first full day of their vacation by flying to Nantucket
from Martha's Vineyard, where they are based for the next two
weeks. After the couple landed on Nantucket in the smaller DC-9
version of Air Force One, Mrs. Clinton's four-vehicle motorcade
broke off from the president's, and they pursued separate
schedules.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton spent a secluded day golfing at the Nantucket
Golf Club, where some club members were miffed that his arrival
might interfere with their tournament tee times. He played with
Kerry and two major Democratic contributors, Wayne Rogers and Jack
Manning.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton spent the morning helping to raise money to rebuild
the 176-year-old United Methodist Church as part of her program to
help preserve national historical sites. She received a standing
ovation from the 80 people inside the church and cheers and
applause from the 250 people outside.
</P>
<P>
   She then went on a tour of Nantucket's historic, cobblestoned
downtown, trailed by many of the 250 people who had gathered
outside the church, and repeatedly hopped out of her car to chat.
She inspected the Dane Gallery and its New England crafts and
stopped in at Nantucket Loom, whose owner, Elizabeth Winship, had
sent Mrs. Clinton a throw-rug.
</P>
<P>
   ``She wasn't shopping,'' Ms. Winship said later. ``She was
learning the history of Nantucket.''
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the afternoon, the Clintons reunited at the Bagley
house before a brief outing to help raise money for the American
Ireland Fund, which promotes peace in Northern Ireland, at the
Nantucket home of Bob Matthews, a New England real estate
developer.
</P>
<P>
   The dinner honored Tim Russert, the NBC newsman, and raised more
than $90,000 for a program called ``Vital Voices,'' which brings
Catholic and Protestant women together. The money is being
contributed in Mrs. Clinton's name. Both Clintons spoke and
afterward, the crowd of more than 100 people, which included actor
Ben Stiller, sang ``Happy Birthday'' in honor of Clinton's 53rd
birthday, which was on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   They returned to the Bagley's ocean-front house, which like much
of Nantucket was festooned with both Irish and American flags, for
the fund-raising dinner for Mrs. Clinton.

VERA KRASOVSKAYA, HISTORIAN AND CRITIC OF THE RUSSIAN BALLET, DIES
AT 83

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Vera Krasovskaya, the dean of Russian ballet historians and a
ballet writer who was highly respected in the West, died on Sunday
at her home in St. Petersburg, Russia. She was 83.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Krasovskaya came to ballet writing after a career as a
dancer. She trained at the Leningrad Choreographic School, where
she studied with the ballet pedagogue Agrippina Vagonova, and
performed with the Kirov Ballet from 1933 to 1941. Her first
writing on dance was published in 1941. She went on to study at the
Leningrad Ostrovsky Institute of the Theater in 1946 and joined its
faculty in 1951. She received a doctorate in art criticism in 1955.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Krasovskaya did not mince words as a critic.
</P>
<P>
   ``No ballet production can be fossilized,'' she wrote in a
review of the recent Kirov Ballet revival of Marius Petipa's
``Sleeping Beauty'' that was reprinted in the August edition of the
English journal Dancing Times in a translation by Igor Stupnikov.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now the company tries to revive what was created more than 100
years ago,'' Ms. Krasovskaya wrote. ``But it cannot pan out. The
idea itself is wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Petipa wrote that any ballet, like a human being, is
continually changing and developing,'' she added. ``I believe that
a ballet production can preserve the delicate aroma of the past and
its inherent energy but it cannot be fossilized.''
</P>
<P>
   She wrote about dancers, choreographers and ballet company
seasons for Soviet and foreign ballet periodicals. She was a leader
in a movement in the 1950's that advocated fresh approaches to
dance at a time when some rebelled against an emphasis on drama in
ballet. She developed as a ballet historian as older historians
were beginning a systematic study of the Russian ballet history.
</P>
<P>
   Her greatest achievements were considered to be her two
four-volume histories. The first, ``Ballet Theater in Russia,'' was
published in 1958 to 1972 and assessed the principles and work of
Petipa, Michel Fokine and other Russian choreographers. The book
provided the basis for a textbook, ``The History of Russian
Ballet,'' published in 1978. Her second major history, considered
her culminating work, was the four-volume ``Western European Ballet
Theater,'' completed in 1996. It was the first comprehensive
history of ballet outside Russia to appear in Russian since 1917.
</P>
<P>
   She also wrote biographies of Anna Pavlova, Vaslav Nijinsky,
Vagonova and the dancer Nikita Dolgushin. Her biography of
Nijinsky, called ``Nijinsky,'' was published in the United States
in 1979. It was her only book to be published in America and
received mixed reviews. In 1989 she made her first and only trip to
the United States, delivering scholarly papers at a Balanchine
Conference in Miami and at New York University. She contributed to
many major reference books on ballet.
</P>
<P>
   In January, she received the privately awarded Triumph Prize,
given in Russia for achievement in the arts and literature. It was
the first time the award has been given for work in dance.
</P>
<P>
   She is survived by her husband, David Zolotnitsky; a brother,
Yuri; a son, Yuri, and a stepdaughter, Tatiana Zolotnitsky, all of
St. Petersburg.

SIR JOHN HALE, HISTORIAN WHO FOCUSED ON THE RENAISSANCE, DIES AT
75  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Britain, Italy, Mass., N.J., Calif.)   By ERIC PACE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sir John Hale, a British historian who specialized in the
Renaissance and was a former chairman of the National Gallery in
London, died on Thursday. He was 75.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was not announced, The Associated Press reported, but
he had been partly incapacitated by a stroke in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Hale's crowning achievement was ``The Civilization of Europe in
the Renaissance,'' published in 1993. Calling it ``one of the great
history books of all time,'' Terence Mullaly, a British art
historian and critic, predicted in The Guardian that it would be
``the book for which he will always be remembered.''
</P>
<P>
   Reviewing it in The New York Times Book Review, Theodore K.
Rabb, a professor of history at Princeton University, said Hale was
``one of Britain's most distinguished students of the period.''
</P>
<P>
   Rabb called Hale's work ``a sweeping and learned traversal of
the age, full of choice details'' and added, ``He reveals how the
very idea of `Europe' and its sense of worldwide mission
crystallized, despite local ivalries and new forms of
self-consciousness.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Given Sir John's ecumenical and expansive approach,'' he
observed, ``and his elegance in bringing to life dozens of
subjects, from gardens to greed, one could not ask for a more vivid
evocation of the sights and sounds of the period.''
</P>
<P>
   Hale was also the author of ``England and the Italian
Renaissance'' (1954), ``Renaissance War Studies'' (1982) and
``Artists and Warfare in the Renaissance'' (1990).
</P>
<P>
   ``The Renaissance is the period and Italy the place I feel most
at home in imaginatively, and the topic I keep coming back to as
the greatest stimulus to thinking about the past is warfare,'' he
said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``Extracurricularly, my greatest pleasure is derived from
looking at works of art.''
</P>
<P>
   Hale had just finished writing ``The Civilization of Europe in
the Renaissance'' when a stroke left him unable to speak and write.
</P>
<P>
   Hale's wife, the former Sheila Haynes MacIvor, along with
another Renaissance expert, Nicolai Rubinstein, and others, saw the
book through to publication.
</P>
<P>
   Hale, who was knighted in 1984, retired in 1988 after seven
years as a professor at the University of London, where he taught
Italian history and then Italian. Earlier he taught at Oxford
University and at the University of Warwick in Coventry, England.
He was chairman of the National Gallery from 1974 to 1980.
</P>
<P>
   He was born in Ashford, Kent, and received bachelor's and
master's degrees in 1948 and 1950 from Oxford, which awarded him a
doctorate in literature in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   He was at various times a visiting fellow at the Harvard Center
for Renaissance Studies at I Tatti, the villa outside Florence that
was once occupied by the art historian Bernard Berenson; a visiting
professor at Cornell and Berkeley Universities, and a member of the
Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, he is survived by two sons and two
daughters.

WOMAN HAS WATCHED THE WORLD CHANGE DRAMATICALLY IN HER 107 YEARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JUDI HUNT  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Olufina Gjertina Duesund Andvik is frail, her skin is cellophane
thin and she is cold most of the time.
</P>
<P>
   But 107 years have not dimmed many memories of her long tenure
on Earth or blunted her mental sharpness. She has strong opinions
and doesn't hesitate to voice them.
</P>
<P>
   Andvik has watched the world change dramatically since her birth
Sept. 8, 1891, in Masfjord, Norway, a town about 60 miles north of
Bergen.
</P>
<P>
   She doesn't like many of the changes, especially in the United
States where she has lived since 1924. ``So much has changed for
the worse,'' she flatly declares, her bright blue eyes flashing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess the worst that's happened is there's nothing that's
wrong anymore. There is no morality, no rules. Nothing is right or
wrong these days.''
</P>
<P>
   She blames greed and materialism, people grabbing for everything
without concern for other people.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have too many things. They think these make them happy,
but they don't,'' she said. ``Happiness comes from living a good
life, caring about their family and neighbors and most of all,
being kind.''
</P>
<P>
   Andvik grew up on a modest Norwegian farm that was big enough
for a few cows, sheep and goats.
</P>
<P>
   She went to school in the winter, rowing across the fjord to
classes held in private homes. In the summers she and the other
village girls took the livestock into the mountains where they
lived in primitive cabins, tending the animals, making goat cheese
and churning butter.
</P>
<P>
   She married her husband in 1922, when she was 31 years old. ``He
was a nice man,'' she said. ``The marriage wasn't always smooth and
sometimes I cried when my feelings were hurt, but we never talked
about divorce once.''
</P>
<P>
   Farming proved too difficult in Norway, so the couple came to
Seattle in 1924. By that time the family included their first son
Bjarne, who was followed over the next few years by Martin and
Orville.
</P>
<P>
   They bought a home in Seattle's Phinney Ridge neighborhood where
Andvik took loving care of her family, attended church, knitted and
crocheted. The family later moved to a former summer cabin above
Lake Sammamish. Her husband died in 1954.
</P>
<P>
   Andvik loves reading, although she now is blind in one eye, said
her son, Bjarne Andvik, 76, of Camano Island, Wash. ``She reads
everything she can get her hands on, especially if it's world
affairs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   She enjoyed her independence for more than three decades, but
finally decided to move into Crista House, a home run by an
independent Protestant religious institution, when she was 95.
</P>
<P>
   Her health remains good, although an old hip and back injury
bother her sometimes. ``It makes my foot hurt,'' she grumbles to
her son, Orville, during a visit.
</P>
<P>
   She remembers the first airplane flight by the Wright brothers
and marvels at how far air travel has gone. ``I wonder sometimes
how God keeps those big machines in the sky and I think it must be
a miracle.''
</P>
<P>
   While family and friends are looking forward to Andvik reaching
her third century, she is not.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope I don't live until then. I never expected to live this
long and, to tell the truth, I'm getting tired. I'm looking forward
to the time when God takes me home, but it's his decision so I just
have to wait.''

SUPPORT SLIPPING FOR FLAT VEHICLE-LICENSE FEE, POLL SHOWS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANGELA GALLOWAY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OLYMPIA, Wash. _ A ballot measure to cut vehicle license taxes
to $30 still enjoys wide support among voters, but that support is
eroding, a new poll shows.
</P>
<P>
   Initiative 695 would impose a flat $30 license tax for all
vehicles, regardless of worth, and would require voter approval for
all new government fees or taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Elway Research, an independent pollster, reported this week that
59 percent of voters polled supported the initiative; 32 percent
opposed it; and 9 percent were undecided.
</P>
<P>
   The poll, with a margin of error of 5 percentage points,
surveyed 400 voters throughout Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The results buoyed the initiative's supporters. ``The Elway poll
simply confirms people's own common sense and conviction that I-695
will pass overwhelmingly this November,'' said sponsor Tim Eyman.
</P>
<P>
   But Mark Funk, spokesman for the No-on-695 campaign, said the
results show that support for the measure is dropping.
</P>
<P>
   A June poll found that 73 percent supported the initiative, with
22 percent opposed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If (Eyman) is not cresting 60 (percent) on this one, he could
have some tough times coming up,'' Funk said. ``Clearly,
something's happening out there. The numbers are coming down and we
think it's going to be a steady trend downward.''
</P>
<P>
   The findings came on the heels of the Secretary of State's
Office releasing its voter guide on the measure a few days ago on
the Internet. Eyman interpreted that guide as a breakthrough for
his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   He was pleased that the statement against the initiative
contained only two endorsements.
</P>
<P>
   Eyman's voters guide statement for the initiative had eight
other endorsements _ from campaign volunteers including retirees, a
plumber and a homemaker.
</P>
<P>
   But Funk said the two men endorsing the opposition statement
represent thousands of Washington entrepreneurs and workers. They
are Don Brunell of the Association of Washington Business and Rick
Bender of the Washington State Labor Council, AFL-CIO.
</P>
<P>
   While Eyman has pitched his campaign as a battle between
Everyman and the ``special interests that own Olympia,'' few
politicians have spoken out against the initiative.
</P>
<P>
   But Eyman's group should not underestimate the grass-roots
opposition on the horizon, Funk said. It's a movement expected to
spend $2 million to $4 million, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Those opponents will bring home to voters how the measure's
elimination of an estimated $1 billion in revenue over the next two
years will hurt police and fire services, health programs, mass
transit and highway construction, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You will see in the next few weeks that there are going to be
hundreds and thousands of people in Washington state that are going
to come out against this proposal,'' Funk said. ``We will have
plenty of people in the trenches when this thing gets up and
running, trust me.''

 CHARLES S. JOELSON, CONGRESSMAN WHO SAVED SCHOOL LIBRARIES, DIES AT
83  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Charles Samuel Joelson, a five-term congressman from New Jersey
who is best remembered for an amendment that spared thousands of
school libraries in 1969, died Tuesday at CentraState Medical
Center in Freehold Township, N.J. He was 83 and lived in Freehold.
</P>
<P>
   Joelson, a Democrat from Paterson whose district covered most of
Passaic County, was first elected to Congress in 1960. His name is
associated with the ``Joelson Package,'' a spending amendment he
pushed through the House just before leaving Capitol Hill for a
judgeship back home in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   As a member of the House Appropriations Committee, he led the
floor fight for a measure that added $1 billion to President
Richard M. Nixon's education budget that year. The money kept an
estimated 40,000 public elementary and secondary school libraries,
most of them serving poor and minority pupils, from shutting down.
It also saved their guidance counseling, vocational and remedial
education programs.
</P>
<P>
   Joelson also helped President Lyndon B. Johnson enact his Great
Society social welfare programs.
</P>
<P>
   Like his father, Harry, before him, Joelson made two
unsuccessful runs for Congress from New Jersey's Eighth District,
which had not sent a Democrat to the House since 1912. The first
time, in 1948, he lost by just 148 votes. The second, in 1954, he
lost more convincingly.
</P>
<P>
   But after his victory in 1960 _ with 54.3 percent of the vote _
he routinely won re-election. He resigned in his fifth term in 1969
to accept an appointment to the bench. At the time, he said he was
tired of having to campaign every other year.
</P>
<P>
   He became a judge of Superior Court, hearing criminal cases. His
other judicial positions were in the Chancery Division, as an
assignment judge in Passaic County, and, finally, in the Appellate
Division in Hackensack, from which he retired in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Paterson, Charles Joelson graduated Phi Beta Kappa
in 1937 from Cornell University, where he also received his law
degree in 1939. He practiced law in Paterson until 1961, with time
out for service as an ensign in the Navy's intelligence service in
the Far East during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   He served on the Paterson City Council in the early 1950s and
then as a ``racket-busting'' deputy attorney general of New Jersey.
Before going to Washington as an unabashed liberal, he also was a
prosecutor in Passaic County and the director of criminal
investigation in the State Department of Law and Public Safety.
</P>
<P>
   Joelson is survived by a daughter, Susan Kelly of Freehold, and
two grandchildren.

ALTINA SCHINASI MIRANDA, DESIGNER OF HARLEQUIN GLASSES, DIES AT
92  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., N. Mex., Turkey)   By NICK RAVO    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Altina Schinasi Miranda, who is credited with designing the
flared-frame Harlequin eyeglasses, which first came into vogue in
the late 1930s and which have made kitschy comebacks from time to
time, died on Thursday at her home in Santa Fe, N.M. She was 92.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Miranda came up with the idea for the pointy glasses while
working as a window display designer on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan.
In an optician's window nearby, she noticed the humdrum round
eyeglasses for women and decided to design something different.
</P>
<P>
   Her new glasses were initially rejected by the major
manufacturers, but Mrs. Miranda allied herself with a stylish
optical shop, Lugene, on Madison Avenue, where one of the first
pairs was sold to the writer Clare Boothe Luce. Other New York
trendsetters followed Mrs. Luce's lead, and by the late 1930s,
Harlequin glasses were the rage.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Miranda's glasses were hailed by magazines like Vogue and
Life, and she decided to establish her own company to distribute
them. In 1939 she received an American Design Award from Lord &AMP;
Taylor for the Harlequins, which remained fashionable through the
1950s and enjoyed a resurgence of hip popularity in the early
1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at any `I Love Lucy' rerun, if Lucille Ball is
wearing glasses, they are Harlequin glasses,'' said David Mayhew of
Maplewood, N.J., a friend of Mrs. Miranda's family.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Miranda was born on Aug. 4, 1907, in a Manhattan mansion to
Moussa and Laurette Schinasi. Schinasi, once a poor Turkish
immigrant, had become a millionaire through his patented
cigarette-rolling machine, which led to the establishment of a
company that manufactured ``ready rolled'' cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1940s Mrs. Miranda sold her eyeglass interests and
moved to Los Angeles. She later became a filmmaker, producing a
film about George Grosz, the Weimar artist, with whom she had once
studied.
</P>
<P>
   In 1981 she relocated to Santa Fe and continued work as a visual
artist until her health began to decline in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   She is survived by her husband, Celestino Miranda; a son, Terry
Sanders of Los Angeles, five grandchildren and two
great-grandchildren.

WASHINGTON WILL BE A KEY STATE IN CAMPAIGN, MCCAIN SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Arizona Sen. John McCain, undaunted by Republican
establishment support for rival George W. Bush, on Friday described
Washington as a key state in the presidential campaign and
indicated he will intensify his efforts here before February's GOP
primary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am convinced the political environment here is open and that
it values those who exercise independent judgment,'' McCain said in
an interview Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   The former Navy pilot and Vietnam POW is best known for
challenging GOP Senate leaders with his advocacy of campaign
finance reform, and his description of Washington, D.C.,
policymaking as ``gridlocked by special interest money.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain and fellow presidential hopeful Elizabeth Dole are
headliners at Saturday's King County GOP picnic on Vashon Island,
west of Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   The picnic is hosted by businessman Thomas Stewart, who was
fined $5 million by the Federal Election Commission for making
illegal campaign donations to Republicans. Stewart served a 60-day
home detention sentence last year after pleading guilty to federal
misdemeanor charges.
</P>
<P>
   But while Democrats have milked publicity out of Stewart's role
in the picnic, thousands of Republicans have turned the annual
party get-together into the state's best-attended political event.
McCain and Dole will be able to court a crowd of 5,000 to 8,000
party faithful.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, to the surprise of his campaign, McCain
picked up a ringing endorsement from Washington Secretary of State
Ralph Munro, who earlier in the year sent a contribution to Bush's
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy stuck with campaign finance reform through thick and
thin: He hasn't wavered and he won't back off,'' Munro, the lone
Republican statewide official, said last night.
</P>
<P>
   McCain was, in his own words, ``a long shot'' when he began
campaigning. He joked here in May that he had ``about as much
chance as a snowball in Gila Bend, Ariz.''
</P>
<P>
   He has also raised eyebrows by applying a Navy officer's tactics
to the GOP race, picking his places of engagement and steering
clear of battles he cannot win. McCain deliberately skipped last
Saturday's Iowa GOP straw poll, calling the pay-for-votes contest
``a sham.''
</P>
<P>
   Lately, however, McCain's campaign has picked up important
endorsements and shown its first glimmers of voter recognition.
</P>
<P>
   Two top organizers of Dan Quayle's campaign in South Carolina _
a key early primary state _ defected to McCain earlier this week.
Sen. Fred Thompson, who had supported fellow Tennessean Lamar
Alexander, signed on Wednesday to be national co-chair of McCain's
campaign. McCain has also gained some ground on Bush and is solidly
in second place in a new poll of likely New Hampshire voters.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has watched Bush stumble and lose his cool as the Texas
governor has come under relentless questioning from the media about
possible past use of cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   He declined to become embroiled in the controversy swirling
around whether Bush should reveal past use _ if any _ of cocaine.
Bush said this week he has not used any illegal drugs within the
past 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The media and the American people determine what is legitimate
news and legitimate questioning,'' said McCain. ``A candidate can
choose whether he or she responds, or does not respond, to
questions. I believe the governor deserves privacy, but it isn't up
to me.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's part of modern politics, and something you have to
consider when getting into this business,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, 62, has acknowledged that he is ``a sinner'' and that
womanizing contributed to the breakup of his first marriage. McCain
and his second wife, Cindy, have four children, ages 7 to 14.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has sailed against the Republican Party's prevailing
winds on certain issues.
</P>
<P>
   A conservationist, he helped write an Arizona wilderness bill,
and an agreement regulating Colorado River flow through the Grand
Canyon to prevent damage to the canyon's ecology.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the good of the party, we have to pay more attention to
the environment,'' he said yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has also courted minorities, specifically Native
Americans and Hispanics. He has decried ``the politics of
division'' and ballot measures establishing English as an
``official'' language.
</P>
<P>
   Christian conservatives have dominated Washington state's GOP
presidential process in recent years. Party rules favor
conservative activists again in 2000. One-third of the state's GOP
convention delegates will be chosen by the Feb. 29 primary. The
March 7 precinct caucuses will account for two-thirds of the
delegation to next year's convention in Philadelphia.

   Nancy Guild, a film actress who starred opposite some of the
leading men of the 1940s and early '50s, died on Monday at her home
in East Hampton, N.Y., after a long battle with emphysema. She was
73.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Guild, whose full name was Nancy Guild Martin, was
``discovered'' in old Hollywood style when she appeared in a 1945
Life magazine picture layout about campus fashions while a student
at the University of Arizona. With her bone structure and
insouciance, she captured the attention of five movie studios,
which offered her screen tests.
</P>
<P>
   She was signed to a seven-year contract by 20th Century-Fox,
during which she made her film debut as a nightclub singer in
Joseph Mankiewicz's ``Somewhere in the Night'' (1946), starring
John Hodiak. Movie ads urged viewers to ``meet that Guild girl; she
rhymes with wild.''
</P>
<P>
   She went on to star with George Montgomery in ``The Brasher
Doubloon'' (1947), based on the Raymond Chandler thriller ``The
High Window,'' and with Orson Welles in ``Black Magic'' (1949). She
retired from acting in the '50s and later wrote for Architectural
Digest.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Martin married the actor Charles Russell, with whom she had
a daughter, Elizabeth. They divorced in 1950 and she married Ernest
Martin, who produced Broadway hits like ``Guys and Dolls.''
Divorced from Martin in 1975, she married John Bryson, a
photojournalist, in 1978. They divorced in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   She is survived by three daughters, Elizabeth Martin of Boulder,
Colo., and Cecilia Martin Ford and Polly Martin of New York, and
three granddaughters.
</P>
<P>
   Eugenie Marron
</P>
<P>
   Eugenie Marron, a renowned big-game fisherwoman a half-century
ago, died on Monday at a hospital in West Palm Beach, Fla. She was
99.
</P>
<P>
   In her heyday, Mrs. Marron, who lived in Brielle, N.J., and Palm
Beach, Fla., held five world fishing records. One women's record,
for a 722-pound swordfish caught in 1954 off Chile, remains
unbroken, according to the International Game Fish Association in
Dania Beach, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Marron traveled the world for big-game fish with her
husband, Louis Marron, who holds a men's record with a 1,182-pound
swordfish caught off Chile in 1953.
</P>
<P>
   She wrote a book about her fishing experiences called
``Albacora: The Search for the Giant Broadbill'' (Random House,
1957). Mrs. Marron also assisted in research at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology and the University of Miami about the
central nervous system of the giant squid.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Marron was born on Nov. 22, 1899, in Jersey City, N.J., and
received a bachelor's degree and a master's degree from Columbia
University. She was also an artist and sculptor; she studied with
Alexander Archipenko.
</P>
<P>
   She is survived by two nieces, Eugenie Wikberg of Fort
Lauderdale, Fla., and Suzanne Treacy of Deerfield Beach, Fla.

IS THE CLOCK RUNNING OUT ON EARNHARDT? 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By PATRICK ZIER   
 The Ledger, Lakeland, Fla.  
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The clock has run out on Dale Earnhardt this year. The question
is whether his time has passed.
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt, 48, is one of four veteran drivers who, as late as
the mid-1990s, pretty much set the pace in NASCAR. The others are
Terry Labonte, Mark Martin and Rusty Wallace.
</P>
<P>
   In 93 races from 1994-1996, this group, along with newcomer Jeff
Gordon, dominated Winston Cup racing.
</P>
<P>
   Between them, Earnhardt, Labonte, Martin and Wallace won 40
times, recorded 175 top-five finishes and earned two championships.
And Earnhardt was the undisputed leader with 11 wins, 52 top fives
and the 1994 Winston Cup title.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, all except Martin have hit hard times, although
Wallace has maintained some semblance of competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt's dropoff has been especially noticeable. In 86 races
since 1996, the seven-time Winston Cup champion has won just twice
and has only 15 top fives. Since 1996, Labonte has three wins and
14 top fives while Wallace has three wins and 28 top fives,
including his third last Sunday at Watkins Glen International in
New York state.
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt's contract with car owner Richard Childress expires
after 2000, and early on, there was talk that he might leave.
Earnhardt owns a Winston Cup car driven by Steve Park, who has
struggled, leading to reports that Earnhardt would replace Park to
pacify primary sponsor Pennzoil. That, however, has been denied and
Earnhardt and Childress are presently working on a new three-year
contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure people want to retire you if they see you have a bad
day or a bad streak or whatever,'' Earnhardt said. ``We feel good
about what we're doing and feel good about our chances to win
races.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to turn the corner and maybe get another
championship in the book before we quit here,'' Earnhardt said.
</P>
<P>
   It is the lure of that record eighth championship that helps
motivate Earnhardt, who is presently tied for the all-time lead
with Richard Petty at seven.
</P>
<P>
   But every year it escapes him, making it less likely he'll ever
get it.
</P>
<P>
   Unless Earnhardt and his team upgrade their performance
significantly _ and soon _ his chances of rising to the top again
become increasingly improbable.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to say why this guy may never win or why he wins,''
Earnhardt said. ``You look at the mark. Rusty Wallace is not
winning as regular as he used to. I'm not winning as regular as I
used to. But Bobby Labonte and Jeff Burton and Dale Jarrett and
these guys are all of a sudden in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why? It's because everything is working for them. The team,
engine guy, crew chief, everything is working for them,'' Earnhardt
said. ``I think Richard Childress and our team are getting closer
to that mark. We've been in the top 10 and been competitive. If we
can just get things to turn the corner a little, I think we'll be
even better.''
</P>
<P>
   While Earnhardt has lost his overall dominance, the one place he
has been overpowering is on NASCAR's two biggest tracks, Daytona
and Talladega. In the three races run on the superspeedways so far,
Earnhardt has been second at Daytona twice and won Talladega.
</P>
<P>
   But he has disappeared from sight just about every place else.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say he's good at the speedways, but he may not be as
good at the road course or at Richmond or whatever,'' Earnhardt
said, speaking about himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll prove that fact wrong. It's just circumstances, whether
it's a bad day or something happens or a chassis or an engine or
whatever,'' he said. ``We just haven't been as consistent as we
need to be or as we've been in the past.''

EDITORIAL OBSERVER: GIULIANI WORKS THE RURAL PRECINCTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ELEANOR RANDOLPH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial observer for Saturday,
Aug. 21:
</P>
<P>
   Symbolism can lean heavily on a political event, which is why
most campaigns try to avoid zoos and hot air balloons. So it seemed
odd that Mayor Rudolph Giuliani found himself in a slightly
uncomfortable position this week _ figuratively, of course _ at a
steak roast outside Binghamton, N.Y. The mayor, upstate for the
evening as part of his coyly unannounced bid for the U.S. Senate,
found himself penned between hot barbecue grills on one side and
the hard questions of reporters on the other. As he spoke on tricky
political issues like the Northeast dairy compact, clouds of smoke
rolled over his head. As he adjusted his brash city tone to the
softer hush of the countryside, cooks hawked steaks to customers
behind him and yelled, ``medium, medium,'' like a chorus promoting
the mayor's moderated form of Republicanism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get a better reception here than I do in New York City,''
Giuliani was boasting into the microphones. He grinned, the
fullest, most mischievous grin in the Giuliani repertoire, and
added, ``I'm the hometown favorite.''
</P>
<P>
   For many of the 3,700 or so contented carnivores attending the
fund-raising dinner for State Sen. Thomas Libous, New York City's
mayor is probably not really their hometown favorite Republican.
His hometown is, after all, New York City, the worst place for a
politician to call home, in their view, unless it's Washington,
D.C., which happens to serve as the present address for first lady
Hillary Clinton. Even those Republican upstaters who are not sure
they like Giuliani are extremely sure they do not like Mrs.
Clinton. ``We can't let Hillary win,'' explained Helen Ferris, a
92-year-old Republican activist who plans to work to help the mayor
and who proudly wears a T-shirt that says, ``I'll sleep when I'm
dead.''
</P>
<P>
   For Giuliani, however, the Clinton name may not scare enough of
his upstate voters to the polls. So he is beginning the hard part,
politically, which is figuring out how to please both his city
followers and the more conservative Republicans upstate. The dairy
compact is one example, a complicated milk-pricing agreement that
Giuliani opposed earlier, fearing it would cause higher prices to
consumers and schoolchildren in the city. The mayor told reporters
near the barbecue pit that he now favors the pact. This shift comes
a few weeks after the first lady endorsed the milk deal, which is
strongly supported by farmers upstate and environmentalists wanting
to preserve open farmlands. When he was asked if he and the first
lady now were in agreement, the mayor bristled in a distinctly
un-rural fashion and said, ``I have no idea what her position is.''
</P>
<P>
   His own position, he continued, is that many of his concerns
have been satisfied with adjustments in the compact. He also noted
that if he were a senator, he would vote for it. In some cases,
this might turn out to be his answer to other upcoming political
contradictions. As mayor of New York, he would do one thing; as a
senator representing the whole state, something different.
</P>
<P>
   This sort of politics could be confusing, if it comes to that,
since the mayor is also facing other political pressures from
conservatives. He might be forced to tilt a little to the
Conservative Party on abortion, which could then offend his
suburban voters if he leans too far against abortion rights. The
antics of the Liberal Party could also come into play here, but as
Giuliani said this week, it's a little soon for worrying about
party lines on the ballot in November 2000. The big strategy these
days is to declare himself the only insider in this race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I come from New York,'' he said at the barbecue, dropping the
word ``City'' for the occasion. ``I've been to Binghamton at least
a dozen times before, probably more than that, 20, 30 times before.
I've been to most parts of the state many, many times.'' The point
here, of course, is that Mrs. Clinton merely knows New York state
by the book.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later Rep. Rick Lazio, from Long Island, appeared
at the fringes of the crowd. Lazio undoubtedly would have been the
favorite of many upstate Republicans, but he was forced out of the
Senate race recently by his party's elders.
</P>
<P>
   For this event, Lazio carefully stayed away from the mayor and,
at one point, vigorously began cooking steaks like a young guest
who fears that if he doesn't pitch in, he'll be off next year's
invitation list. ``I'm here to cook. I'm here to serve,'' he said,
meaning not only the food but the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the mayor returned to the city where some voters
could start wondering whether their tough-guy mayor turns softer on
some of their favorite issues once he strays upstate.

EDITORIAL: EMERGENCE OF A VENEZUELAN POTENTATE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, Aug. 21:
</P>
<P>
   Venezuela is the world's largest oil exporter outside the Middle
East, yet 80 percent of its people live in poverty. Hugo Chavez won
the presidency nine months ago promising to end the corruption and
mismanagement that has helped to squander Venezuela's riches. But
while Venezuelans overwhelmingly supported radical reform, they
should be very wary of the methods Chavez is using. He is drawing
power into his own hands, and misusing a special Constitutional
Assembly meeting now in Caracas that is composed almost entirely of
his supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez, a former paratroop commander who staged an unsuccessful
military coup in 1992, has so far shown little respect for the
compromises necessary in a democracy, which Venezuela has had for
40 years. He has defied rulings of the Senate and Supreme Court. He
has promoted his fellow coup plotters and installed military
officers in high positions, including as his chief of staff.
Venezuela, which suffered under military rule before the advent of
democracy, has laws limiting the military's role in politics. This
week the government ordered soldiers to patrol the streets to
combat crime, a move that has proved ineffective and repressive
when tried elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez's most ambitious act so far is the establishment of the
Constitutional Assembly, which was elected in April and began work
this month. Unhappily, he has urged the assembly to lengthen his
term and give him the right to succeed himself. Although the
Supreme Court has ruled that the assembly's only job is to write a
constitution, the body, at Chavez's urging, is trying to take over
the functions of the government. This week it voted to establish a
commission to evaluate all sitting judges, including those on the
Supreme Court, and the assembly's president warned that judges who
opposed its decisions would be sacked. Delegates will soon take up
a proposal to slash the size and powers of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to see how the Jacobin decisions of Chavez and the
assembly will help Venezuela. The president's economic proposals
seem destined to fail at fighting poverty. He is right to emphasize
basic services for the poor like access to credit and health care.
But Chavez also wants to add such oddities as a state automaker to
the huge government bureaucracies that are depressing the economy
today. Because of oil, the Venezuelan middle class has come to
expect government jobs, generous pensions and subsidies as their
birthright. The country can no longer afford them. But Chavez has
shown little inclination to challenge this system.
</P>
<P>
   Nor are his proposed political reforms likely to reduce
corruption. Judges are bribable largely because they get inadequate
training and the judiciary is underfinanced. Replacing judges with
those more to the assembly's liking will not change this. Countries
that have successfully fought corruption have done so by increasing
accountability and instituting checks on those in authority. Chavez
and his assembly are seeking to do the opposite by concentrating
power in the presidency.

EDITORIAL: THE NEXT ATTACK ON DIRTY WATER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mo., Iowa, N.C., Md., Wash., Ore.)  (mk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, Aug. 21:
</P>
<P>
   Under pressure from environmental groups, the Clinton
administration now plans to invoke a largely ignored section of the
1972 Clean Water Act to tackle the biggest remaining threat to the
nation's waterways _ polluted runoff. Federal and state governments
have greatly reduced the pollution that flows from readily
identifiable sources like factories and waste treatment plants. But
they have singularly failed to control polluted runoff from more
diffuse sources like farms, city streets, even golf courses. Farm
runoff in particular has been blamed for widespread fish kills and
even human illness. It is also the main reason why more than
two-fifths of the country's waters _ some 20,000 rivers, lakes and
estuaries altogether _ are still too dirty for fishing or swimming.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, federal regulators have made little effort to
control runoff _ known technically as ``non-point source
pollution'' _ largely because it is harder to measure and control
than toxic substances that flow from ``point sources'' like
industrial pipes. But it is no less threatening to water quality.
Farms, for example, pour out pathogens from manure and pesticides
and, in the case of huge hog- or chicken-breeding factory farms,
vast quantities of nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus that
destroy aquatic life in rivers and streams.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental groups have thus brought dozens of lawsuits to try
to force Washington to resurrect and enforce a long-dormant
provision of the Clean Water Act. The provision requires each state
to assess the health of every body of water within its borders,
determine the maximum allowable levels of pollutants for each one
and then parcel out the responsibility for meeting these goals to
individual polluters _ whether they be point sources like factories
or non-point sources like farms.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Browner, the administrator of the Environmental Protection
Agency, has now promised to enforce the provision. Her plan would
require detailed assessments of water conditions in every state
within two to three years, as well as an equally detailed action
plan. States that do not comply risk federal intervention, but in
the end the dirty work _ measuring pollution, identifying the
culprits and forcing changes _ will be left to the states.
</P>
<P>
   Despite years of indifference at the state level, some states
now seem eager to tackle the problem. Missouri's attorney general,
Jay Nixon, reached a $25 million settlement with a hog operation
whose untreated waste was fouling Missouri waters _ the largest
settlement of its kind. Attorneys general in Iowa and North
Carolina have been fighting violations. In 1997, in an effort to
save the Chesapeake Bay, Maryland enacted legislation to control
farm runoff. Wisconsin has moved aggressively to control runoff
from all sources. Washington and Oregon, under court order to save
their threatened salmon runs, are carrying out their own
inventories of polluted waters and have welcomed Ms. Browner's
plan.
</P>
<P>
   The plan may inspire political opposition among some farmers and
developers, and will impose new costs on polluters who have
heretofore escaped regulation. To ease that burden, the
administration will offer grants and loans. But the key to the
plan's success will be vigorous regulatory oversight, especially in
Washington.

460,000 WASHINGTON MOTORISTS GET LICENSE RENEWAL NOTICES BY
MISTAKE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OLYMPIA _ If you got a bill in the mail Friday to renew your
license tabs and you think there's a mistake, you're probably
right.
</P>
<P>
   More than 460,000 Washington motorists received erroneous
renewal notices from the state Friday, the Department of Licensing
said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of mailing out bills to drivers whose tabs expired in
October, the state inadvertently sent them to drivers whose tabs
ran out last June, said department spokesman Mark Varadian.
</P>
<P>
   Varadian figures about 98 percent of those folks, most of whom
got the bills Friday, are already up to speed on their plates.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can just go ahead and rip up that letter if they've
already paid for those tabs,'' Varadian said.
</P>
<P>
   The blunder cost taxpayers about $191,000 in printing costs and
postage, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently the mishap can be blamed on miscommunication between
two state bureaucracies.
</P>
<P>
   The state Department of Information Services stores vehicle
license records. Each month, it transfers a database of who owes
money onto a tape, and the Licensing Department sends the tape off
to the printers.
</P>
<P>
   This month, because of a mix-up with the tapes, the wrong
information was sent to the printers.
</P>
<P>
   Does that mean that a simple human error foiled the computerized
accounting process?
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems that way, yes,'' said Varadian.
</P>
<P>
   Concerned drivers can count on computer technology _ if not
state workers _ to protect them from actually paying twice for
tabs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fortunately, the DOL's automated system will not accept a
duplicate transaction,'' said Nancy Kelly, assistant director for
vehicle services for the Department of Licensing.
</P>
<P>
   Take note: The nearly half a million Washington drivers whose
tabs expire in October are not off the hook.
</P>
<P>
   Genuine renewal notices for those drivers will be mailed out
next week.
</P>
<P>
   The state hopes to head off future human errors by eventually
sending the information electronically.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more of a direct process and cleaner,'' Varadian said.
``It's on our schedule of things to do, but there isn't a date
yet.''

MONDESI LEADS DODGERS PAST PHILLIES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Raul Mondesi ended his silence. With his bat and
with his mouth. The former was more impressive than the latter.
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi's two-out, two-run homer in the ninth inning tied the
score and the Los Angeles Dodgers scored four times in the 10th to
beat Philadelphia 8-5 Friday at Veterans Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   It was Mondesi's first homer since he hit two against the Mets
12 days ago, and the first time he's spoken since lashing out at
the Dodgers' brain trust last Wednesday in Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward Mondesi, who also stole a base, only wanted to talk
about the Dodgers' unexpected comeback after Phillies starter
Robert Person held them to one hit _ Eric Karros' seventh-inning
homer _ through eight innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like I always say, just do the best for the team,'' said
Mondesi, who needs five homers and six stolen bases for his second
30-30 season. ``Any time we win a game, that's good for the team no
matter how we win. We have 40 games left. Who knows? We have to
keep playing hard.''
</P>
<P>
   In a zany season in which the Dodgers (55-67) are challenging
the Angels for the greatest disappointment on the field and most
chaos away from it, this rally was inexplicable and
uncharacteristic. The Dodgers hadn't won in extra innings since May
30, a losing string of seven. They had lost their last 11 series
openers.
</P>
<P>
   Even the optimistic manager, Davey Johnson, wasn't holding his
breath for a ninth-inning rally against a pitcher who struck out a
career-high 11 through eight innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, by and large, it was over,'' Johnson said. ``Then
the kid got a little wild. We got a little more patient. To see
Mondy come through ... he didn't crush it, but it was a good way to
start the trip.''
</P>
<P>
   Person baffled the Dodgers by getting ahead quickly in the
count, but after Karros' groundout scored Mark Grudzielanek to cut
the deficit to 4-2 in the ninth, Devon White was plunked with a
pitch and Mondesi hit Person's first pitch, a slider, over the
left-field fence to tie it.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, most of the time I swing at the first pitch,'' Mondesi
said. ``I don't like to give anybody a strike.''
</P>
<P>
   In search of his first complete game, Person entered the inning
having thrown 122 pitches. He finished with 144.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's why this game is fun,'' Johnson said. ``You never take
anything for granted, and boom, boom, it's our bullpen against
their bullpen.''
</P>
<P>
   Phillies reliever Wayne Gomes allowed a leadoff single in the
10th and walked three straight batters to give the Dodgers the
lead. Todd Hollandsworth, Karros, White and Gary Sheffield each had
an RBI in the inning.
</P>
<P>
   It helped ease what, for much of the night, looked to be another
wasted Kevin Brown outing in a wasted season.
</P>
<P>
   Brown allowed eight hits, two earned runs and struck out seven
in seven innings. He was also victimized by two errors and trailed
3-1 when he left, but continued to pitch well. He didn't figure in
the decision, but he's 4-1 with a 0.99 ERA in his past six starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We showed a lot of guts hanging in there. The guy was pitching
well and we got a few breaks,'' Brown said. ``I don't think I've
thrown the ball exceptionally well during this streak you're
talking about. I've battled out of some tough situations. It's not
like I walked out there and just breezed.''

Perrot's death weighing heavily on teammates
<TEXT>
<P>
   By W.H. STICKNEY JR.
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ She should have died hereafter; there would have
been a time for such a rest. Because it didn't happen, for her, we
do our best.
</P>
<P>
   With apologies to William Shakespeare, the attempt at paraphrase
typifies the manner in which the Comets are going about business
following the death Thursday of point guard Kim Perrot from cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The task Friday night was to face the Los Angeles Sparks. But
every pass, every shot, seemed not to have been executed with the
normal zest.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, the Sparks won 68-64.
</P>
<P>
   Not that it matters. Not that anyone really cares.
</P>
<P>
   The atmosphere had been quite different Monday and Wednesday
when the Comets fed off their negative emotions and beat Utah and
Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is different,'' Comets coach Van Chancellor said Friday.
``This is a lot different. This is after this is when ''
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor's train of thought was interrupted, but his idea was
clear. The Comets on Friday were playing for the first time knowing
Perrot was no longer alive.
</P>
<P>
   It was a heavy burden to bear for both sides.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to go out there and play like this,'' said Sparks
center Lisa Leslie.
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks had ``addressed the situation'' during the morning
shootaround, said coach Orlando Woolridge. Then, the distractions
had been minimized.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sat down and talked about what to expect, the things the
Comets would bring, as far as would they be flat, how our reaction
would be to that, what the crowd reaction would be.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of things that went on tonight,'' he said.
``On top of that, it was a very important game for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed. Lost in the emotion was the fact the Sparks are still
fighting Sacramento for positioning in the playoffs. Coming into
the game, the Sparks held down second place in the Western
Conference by only a half-game over the Monarchs.
</P>
<P>
   White ribbons that lit up Compaq Center during Comets wins
Monday and Wednesday were very much in evidence at the Forum.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was an emotional night,'' said Woolridge. ``I know that
people are apt to say that women are more emotional than men, but I
think Van and I probably had more of difficult time than the
players did.''
</P>
<P>
   Tina Thompson has endured a particularly tough go of it since
Perrot was airlifted last Sunday from Mexico, where she had been
undergoing ``experimental'' cancer treatment, to Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Friday was no exception. The mask of steel normally worn by the
24-year-old first player drafted out of college into the WNBA was,
at times, streaked with tears. Thompson labored to get 13 points.
</P>
<P>
   Word has it Sheryl Swoopes collapsed in the hallways at Compaq
Center last Saturday when news that Perrot's condition had worsened
crept into the Comets' locker room. But Swoopes still managed a
game-high 25 points Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Cynthia Cooper, Perrot's closest friend who didn't arrive until
approximately 8 p.m. Houston time, did not play. She sat near the
end of the Comets bench in street clothes.
</P>
<P>
   The opportunity existed for the Sparks to really pour it on.
Chancellor midway the opening period had summoned most of the
nucleus of the team over to sit with Cooper.
</P>
<P>
   Amaya Valdemoro, Jennifer Rizzotti, Jackson and Janeth Arcain
picked up loads of minutes, Arcain starting in place of Cooper.
</P>
<P>
   But mercifully, despite the fight he's in with Sacramento,
Woolridge responded by emptying his bench. Consequently, the Sparks
at halftime led by only 32-31.
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor lacked his usual enthusiasm for much of the 40-minute
game. But with 5:12 to play and the Sparks leading 59-56, he picked
up a technical foul after arguing an out-of-bounds call with an
official.
</P>
<P>
   It was perhaps a venting of his feelings that have been worn raw
over the last two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Friday's game weren't an escape, Chancellor said, ``I
don't know if I like the word escape. It was an outlet to play
ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care what you do, you're not going to escape the fact
of reality. Maybe it's the best way we could cope, and there's no
good way. There's no good way to cope with this situation, but this
was probably the best way.''

DEATH SENTENCED COMMUTED, FAYE COPELAND DREAMS OF POSSIBLE
FREEDOM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LEE HILL KAVANAUGH  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   `You didn't ask'
</P>
<P>
   Minding your own business was the family motto, says Al
Copeland, 51, who lives in Chillicothe and was the Copelands'
fourth child.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mom didn't know about the killings, just like I didn't know
about them,'' he says. ``I do think she knew about Ray's cattle
scams. You've got to understand if we asked him anything about his
business, he beat the snot out of us. It was understood _ you
didn't ask.''
</P>
<P>
   Prison for his mother is an ironic twist in her life, he says,
because living with Ray prepared her for prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's using the same type of emotion in prison that she used
with him,'' says Copeland. ``She looked away then when things went
on. She stuck to her business. All the same things she does in
prison now.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they tell her to do something, she does it and doesn't
complain, just as she did with Ray. I don't see a bit of
difference. I think prison is probably better for her than home.
Nobody abuses her there.''
</P>
<P>
   Jurors were convinced of Faye Copeland's guilt when the
prosecution turned up a handwritten list of farmhands in her
writing, hidden in a camera case.
</P>
<P>
   She had written the names because Ray Copeland was illiterate.
There were 12 names with scrawled X's by them and other names with
the word ``back'' next to them, her lawyers say.
</P>
<P>
   Five of the men with an X by their names turned up dead.
</P>
<P>
   Four other transients marked with an X police later found alive
and well, her lawyers say, and three men's whereabouts are still a
mystery. Prosecutors believe they were buried near the others.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was this sinister X next to names...'' recalls Hulshof,
now a U.S. representative. ``It refutes this woman who was caught
in the circumstances and shows her as much more of an accomplice
than she claimed.''
</P>
<P>
   Early in the trial Faye Copeland was offered a plea agreement.
In exchange for telling where the other three men were buried, she
would have been able to walk out a free woman. But she told
authorities she couldn't tell them where anybody was, because she
didn't know.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Copeland had a long history of writing bad checks, going in
and out of prisons since the 1930s and disappearing for two to
three days at a time, says Sean O'Brien, Faye Copeland's attorney.
</P>
<P>
   ``Faye is just as much a victim of Ray's conduct as are those
men planted in the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Hulshof, however, says Faye Copeland may have stood up to her
husband more than she lets on. Neighbors reported hearing her curse
at Ray when working with him.
</P>
<P>
   The list of X's spooks Al Copeland.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Ray would have been arrested in 1987, I'd probably been
arrested too, because in 1986 I was going to the sale barns with
him and the hired hands, '' he says. ``I was writing down the names
and told to put X's by the men who ran off.''
</P>
<P>
   Copeland regrets his testimony at his mother's trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``They asked me if I ever saw her abused,'' he says. ``I told
them no. But I wasn't allowed to say why.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Ray got in one of his moods, we all scattered. My
brothers and sister never saw Ray hit me either. That was our
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Al Copeland says he has his own brutal memories.
</P>
<P>
   At 10, his father beat him with a claw hammer because he handed
him the wrong tool, he says.
</P>
<P>
   Another time, he was milking cows and a cow kicked over her
bucket. Al Copeland still suffers back pain from that beating by
his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``My family was very different from most families,'' he says.
Beyond prison walls
</P>
<P>
   Faye Copeland's words tumble and stop, like a square-wheeled
cart bouncing over a gravel road. But always, always, looming
somewhere in her answers is the knowledge of everything she is
missing.
</P>
<P>
   It's apparent when she talks about her grandchildren and
great-grandchildren, including ``three more on the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago was the very best day she's had yet in prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cried all day, all the night and half the next day,'' she
says about the news that her life was spared. ``Now I'm waiting for
the next one.''
</P>
<P>
   Her attorneys are working and she is hoping. But she only shakes
her head when asked if she ever thought her life would end up this
way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've often thought since, maybe this was the for the best,''
she says. ``Where did I go wrong, if I went wrong? I know one place
was getting married at all. But he was my life for many, many
years. I didn't know nothing else.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will I get out? I may go out feet first but I'll get out of
here. Someday.''

   NY-RADIO-GIULIANI (New York) _ If there's anything callers to
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's weekly radio show should know before

David in Oceanside called recently to complain about the ban on pet
ferrets, the mayor leaned into the microphone on his desk and said,
``There is something deranged about you.'' The mayor created ``Live
From City Hall with Rudy Giuliani'' in 1994 as a means of talking
to ordinary citizens about the frustrations of city life, and sure
enough, he helps dozens of callers navigate city bureaucracy. But

administrators have been gathering the parents of incoming freshmen
to gird them for the journey on which they and their families are
about to embark. While orientations for the freshmen have been
fixtures at colleges for more than a decade, the systematic

Keeping up with Jones no easy feat
<TEXT>
<P>
   By FRAN BLINEBURY
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   SEVILLE, Spain _ At the breakfast news conference hosted by
their ubiquitous shoe company, the fleet-footed twosome of Michael
Johnson and Maurice Greene sat side by side, grinning through bared
teeth like a couple of pit bulls on short leashes.
</P>
<P>
   The two men who can lay legitimate claim to the title of world's
fastest human will not square off at the World Track and Field
Championships, which open today. Greene will run in the 100 and 200
and Johnson in the 400.
</P>
<P>
   When they were asked who might win a showdown over 200 meters,
both had the same succinct answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Me,'' Greene said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Me,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   That's the way it normally is in the world of elite sprinting,
where the atmosphere can often be likened to a heavyweight fight.
The combatants preen and glare and prepare silently, as though
talking will somehow sap their swiftness.
</P>
<P>
   Which is what makes the figure who sat on the other side of the
stage along the banks of the serene Guadalquivir River such a
refreshing and charming diversion.
</P>
<P>
   Marion Jones might as well have been floating on the river in
one of the paddleboats.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that the next eight days will find her running a
self-imposed gantlet that will test her speed, her strength, her
stamina and maybe even her sanity as she attempts to win four gold
medals here, then up the count to five at the 2000 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   You might not know her now. But you will by the time NBC gets
through beaming Jones' exploits from Sydney next summer.
</P>
<P>
   This is her show.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just here to try,'' she said, flashing a smile that makes
her a cross between the girl next door and Wonder Woman.
</P>
<P>
   She also is the brightest hope to lift her beleaguered sport out
of the depths of the negative publicity surrounding the latest
round of high-profile steroid busts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anyone could have thought this was going to
happen,'' Jones said. ``In the past couple of weeks, our beautiful
and lovely sport has been marred by all of this. I think the
athletes wish we could have come here to Seville and put all of
that in the past and start on a positive note. But now we can only
hope that our wonderful performances in a couple of days will
overshadow everything that has happened.''
</P>
<P>
   She is as bright and sunny as a Spanish afternoon, even in the
face of controversy and the hectic schedule that awaits her over
the next eight days. The 23-year-old faces a frantic opening
schedule today with two rounds of the 100 meters and qualifying in
the long jump.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to go out there and hopefully qualify on my first jump
and then be able to concentrate on the 100,'' she said. ``I'm just
ready to get started. That's all I know for sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones talks about her schedule in the multiple events, but never
about any burden she has placed on herself to win them all, though
that is clearly the plan.
</P>
<P>
   She makes it sound no more difficult than a week's worth of
sightseeing around the cobblestone streets of the old city. But
those in the know are aware that what Jones is attempting is
something for the ages as she tries to become the first woman to
win four gold medals in the same World Championships.
</P>
<P>
   John Smith, the former Olympic medalist and now the coach for
Greene and Inger Miller, one of Jones' competitors in the 200, nods
in admiration.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's going to stand on that podium four or five times,'' he
said. ``It's just a matter of what color (medal) she's going to
stand there with. But I'm going to be watching very intently to see
it happen. There is going to be some history being made and our
sport needs that. Actually, she needs the challenges, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones won gold in the 100 and the 400 relay at the 1997 World
Championships in Athens and has been virtually untouchable in the
sprints since.
</P>
<P>
   She might be vulnerable in the long jump, where she finished in
10th place in Athens and has lost three times since, twice to
Olympic medalist Heike Drechsler and in June at the U.S. nationals
to Dawn Burrell, the younger sister of University of Houston coach
Leroy Burrell.
</P>
<P>
   In the sprints, Jones uses her long thoroughbred's legs to
simply move away from the field, in the manner of Carl Lewis. But
the long jump also requires form and technique, a combination that
makes Lewis' record of four straight Olympic gold medals in that
event even more impressive.
</P>
<P>
   So, if it's Lewis' legacy Jones is trying to run down, and even
eclipse, it is perhaps fitting it's in the event he owned that she
has the hardest work to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm ready. I need this,'' Marion Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Almost as much, right now, as track and field needs her.

DEATH SENTENCED COMMUTED, FAYE COPELAND DREAMS OF POSSIBLE
FREEDOM

<P>
   VANDALIA, Mo. _ Birthdays don't matter in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Faye Copeland's Aug. 4 birthday was just another notch in her
life, a grim reminder that 78 years had passed since she was born
in an Arkansas log cabin.
</P>
<P>
   Like every day in prison, she rose at 5 a.m. along with 1,402
other incarcerated women. She tended to seedlings in the
greenhouse.
</P>
<P>
   That's her prison job. It's also her life. But there was one
difference in this 24-hour span.
</P>
<P>
   In the Kansas City federal courthouse some 220 miles away was a
stack of papers holding one of the best birthday presents Copeland
may ever get _ a judge's commutation of her death sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Barring an appeal from Attorney General Jay Nixon within 45 days
of the judgment, Copeland won't die by lethal injection.
</P>
<P>
   The commutation was only a partial victory, say her attorneys,
Sean O'Brien and Kent Gibson, who filed the petition in January
1998. Although U.S. District Judge Ortrie Smith commuted her death
sentence, agreeing with some of the issues Copeland's attorneys
raised, he upheld the punishment of life without parole.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday her attorneys filed more paperwork in U.S. District
Court, petitioning for a new trial based on information that her
jury never heard.
</P>
<P>
   They argue she was the victim of 50 years of abuse from her
husband, Ray.
</P>
<P>
   A great-grandmother 21 times over, she once won second place in
the Ozark Empire Fair for her pickled beets and still dreams of
returning to her farmhouse in Mooresville, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, prosecutors paint a far different picture of Copeland,
until two weeks ago the oldest woman on death row.
</P>
<P>
   Nine years ago she was convicted of first-degree murder for her
role in one of the largest serial murder cases in Missouri history.
Prosecutors said she was deeply involved in the killings of five
transients whose bodies were unearthed near her farm.
</P>
<P>
   Her attorneys admit a new trial is a long shot. But even its
possibility gives hope to Copeland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wouldn't you?'' Copeland said this week to visitors.
``Everyone hopes, even just to see another day. Nothing's
guaranteed in this life 'cept dying.''
Life on the inside
</P>
<P>
   The Women's Eastern Reception, Diagnostic and Correctional
Center in Vandalia is a 47-acre complex of blood-red buildings.
Opened in December 1997, the prison is a state-of-the-art facility
and one of the newest in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Faye Copeland was transferred here from the Chillicothe
Correctional Center almost a year ago, because a relative was
working there.
</P>
<P>
   Softening the edges of the Vandalia prison's razor-wire fences
are hundreds of marigolds, zinnias, euonymus and barberry bushes,
all raised by hand from prisoner 000888003.
</P>
<P>
   To inmates she is known as ``Mrs. Faye.'' To the outside world,
she is ``the murderer.''
</P>
<P>
   Copeland has been in prison since her arrest and conviction in
1990 for a scheme with her husband, Ray, involving cattle, bad
checks and five murdered transients, killings that she maintains
her deceased husband committed without her knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   Jurors thought otherwise, convicting her of first-degree murder
and sentencing her to death.
</P>
<P>
   Kenny Hulshof, the co-prosecutor, called the Copeland couple
20th century cattle rustlers. Abuse in Faye Copeland's life was
never an issue, he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time, the law for battered spouse syndrome only applied
to cases involving self-defense,'' he says.``And all these claims
of abuse by the family members did not come out until after Ray's
death, after Ray could no longer defend himself....
</P>
<P>
   ``We found that Faye was an equal partner with Ray. Yes, Ray was
a gruff old farmer. But Faye is not a meek demure woman, just a
woman who knew hard times.''
A tolerable life
</P>
<P>
   At the prison's visiting room, an alarm sounds announcing an
arrival. Entering is a gray-headed woman, walking with concerted
steps past vending machines and several walls of visiting rules.
</P>
<P>
   Faye Copeland's face reflects a mix of dull despair, anger and
fear. After a brief smile, her lips draw into a thin line.
</P>
<P>
   She is wary of interviews, especially after a ``60 Minutes''
piece where she was portrayed as the picture of the American Gothic
gone bad.
</P>
<P>
   But her full story, the one of the abuse and battering that the
jurors didn't hear a decade ago, needs to be heard, her attorneys
say. So, they urge her to talk about her life.
</P>
<P>
   The basis of her petition rests on the fact that evidence of her
abuse was never introduced at the trial.
</P>
<P>
   She shakes hands with her visitors, with the soft grip of a
78-year-old woman who has diabetes and a heart condition.
</P>
<P>
   Life is very different than on the farm, she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't have flowers at home,'' she says. ``He didn't like
me to be tending to anything other than him. As long as I was with
him or working the cattle or the tractor that was OK. But flowers,
no, he didn't like them.''
</P>
<P>
   As she speaks, her voice is barely louder than a whisper.
Voicing her own opinion, she says, wasn't what a wife should do if
her husband didn't like it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was raised to love my husband and support him no matter
what,'' she says. ``The man is the head of the family. The Bible
says it should be that way. It wouldn't do to say if Ray was mean
to me or not....Yes, he did mess up my life, but that's not to say
that I wasn't a good wife to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was never mean to him....Maybe we'd have got along better if
I had knocked the hell out of him a few times.''
</P>
<P>
   She laughs at that thought. Then her hands rub at an age spot on
her arm. She squints out the window where blue skies advertise a
beautiful day. Again, her lips return to their tight line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like talkin' with the media because 90 percent of the
time wasn't nothin' said right,'' she says. ``Just tell the truth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll give you that probably the worst mistake of my life was
marrying him,'' she says. Ray Copeland, 78, died in 1993 before the
state could execute him.
</P>
<P>
   ``But life can be good or it can be bad. It's what you make of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Except for Christmases and her children's birthdays, prison life
for her is tolerable.

PERROT'S FIRE DIMS BUT WON'T GO OUT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ If Cynthia Cooper and Sheryl Swoopes were
the front and back covers of the Houston Comets' first two
storybook seasons, Kim Perrot was the spine that bound all the
pages.
</P>
<P>
   Perrot was tough as leather but it was the elasticity of her
spirit that, in the end, kept the Comets from scattering like loose
pages Friday in one of life's cold, stiff winds.
</P>
<P>
   The two-time defending WNBA champions showed up at the Forum for
a scheduled game against the Los Angeles Sparks, not because any of
them felt like playing but because they knew it was what Perrot
would have wanted.
</P>
<P>
   It is a measure of how much the fiery point guard meant to her
teammates that she continued to have a powerful, positive hold over
them in death, the same as she had in life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more of a tribute to the fighting spirit of Kim than
anything else,'' said Houston coach Van Chancellor of the Comets'
decision to play the Sparks the day after Perrot lost a six-month
battle with cancer.
</P>
<P>
   What a cruel, cruel summer it just became for those in cancer's
grip.
</P>
<P>
   In June and July cyclist Lance Armstrong gave renewed hope to
cancer victims and their loved ones with his improbable wins, in
short, sweet succession, over cancer and the field in the Tour de
France.
</P>
<P>
   Then on Thursday cancer roared back with a vengeance, striking
down a strong, sprightly sports figure in her prime, as if to serve
notice that it remains a very formidable foe.
</P>
<P>
   That there are eight million Americans who have survived to tell
of their close encounter with cancer is of small comfort to the
family and friends of the more than 500,000 who will lose the
battle this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no good way to cope with this situation,'' Chancellor
said.
</P>
<P>
   He stood slouched, as if the weight of Perrot's passing was his
alone to shoulder, and addressed reporters after his team's
mourning shootaround.
</P>
<P>
   The Comets _ minus Cooper, who had stayed behind in Houston to
keep a vigil at Perrot's bedside _ filed so stiffly and silently
into the Forum, they could have been stepping into a funeral
parlor. Cooper would join them later for the game, but did not
attempt to play.
</P>
<P>
   The light workout did seem more like a wake, with players
staring vacantly into space and Swoopes leaving the court at one
point to sit and bury her head in her hands.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't just the Houston players who were hurting. The Sparks'
shootaround also was cloaked in black, its solemnity signifying
that the death of a player as popular Perrot is an unspeakable loss
to the WNBA family.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely a very sad day in women's basketball,'' said
center Lisa Leslie, who knew Perrot well enough to consider her a
friend. Of course, to meet Perrot was to become her pal. She
collected friends the way lesser people do grudges.
</P>
<P>
   Perrot's personality had a way of lighting up a room. So it's
surprising klieg lights were needed on the day this past spring
when Perrot showed up at the Women's NCAA Final Four to watch
Leslie film a Nike promotional spot.
</P>
<P>
   Perrot playfully heckled Leslie between takes. ``She was still
in high spirits,'' Leslie recalled.
</P>
<P>
   The last time Leslie saw Perrot, 32, was on June 22, when the
Sparks played at Houston. In a halftime ceremony of a game the
Comets would win by eight points, the players received their 1998
championship rings.
</P>
<P>
   Swoopes and Cooper combined for 61 points but the star of the
evening was Perrot, who had just returned from the first of two
trips she would take to Tijuana seeking alternative treatment for
the cancer that had attacked her lungs and brain.
</P>
<P>
   By that time the cancer clearly had weakened her body. Perrot's
spirit, however, was as strong as ever. It remained so, Chancellor
said, right up until she drew her final breath.
</P>
<P>
   There are so many stories Chancellor would have liked to have
told about Perrot, only the lump in his throat got in the way. This
one, he coaxed out ahead of the tears:
</P>
<P>
   In mid-February Perrot underwent five hours of brain surgery to
remove cancerous tumors. She was visited in the recovery room by
her mother, Cooper and Chancellor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hi, mom,'' she whispered. ``Hi, Cynthia.'' Then, seeing
Chancellor, her voice grew stronger. ``Hey, Coach. Don't you be
going out and drafting another point guard. I'm going to be your
point guard.''
</P>
<P>
   She really believed it, too. ``She was so upbeat,'' Leslie said,
``you never really were left feeling like she'd lose the battle to
cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   Perrot made it hard for people to cry for her because she never
allowed herself a second of self-pity. So the sorrow her many, many
friends and admirers felt Friday was for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Perrot, they knew, had gone to a better place. And left this one
a little less divine.

Astros' Hidalgo may miss rest of season
<TEXT>
<P>
   By CARLTON THOMPSON
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Astros outfielder Richard Hidalgo's injured left knee is
not getting any better and season-ending surgery looks like a
possibility.
</P>
<P>
   Hidalgo, who has played through pain for most of the season, has
been on the disabled list since Aug. 9, a few days after his knee
gave out during batting practice in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros hoped rest would be enough of a tonic to get their
starting left fielder back onto the field, but so far he hasn't
made much progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm concerned about Richard,'' Astros general manager Gerry
Hunsicker said. ``There is a possibility that he won't be back at
all this season.''
</P>
<P>
   The plan is to re-evaluate Hidalgo's status in a week. If there
is no progress, Hunsicker said surgery would be considered.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it goes another week without improvement, there won't be
much optimism,'' Hunsicker said.
</P>
<P>
   Hidalgo's injury is the result of a congenital defect. His left
kneecap never fused the way it does with most people; it's
something he has dealt with throughout his career.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the wear and tear of playing on artificial turf worsened
the situation. This is the most extensive time Hidalgo, 24, has
spent on turf in his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``Richard is extremely disappointed,'' said Peter Greenberg,
Hidalgo's agent. ``He went as far as he could on that knee. My
impression from talking to Richard is that the chances of him
making it through the year are very slim.
</P>
<P>
   ``Richard has been through a lot in his career in terms of
injuries, and he has a high tolerance for pain. If he says he can't
perform, he can't perform.''
</P>
<P>
   If Hidalgo needs surgery, it would be another blow for the
Astros, who might not get Moises Alou back this season. Right
fielder Derek Bell also is on the disabled list, and Hunsicker said
he's still sore. Bell, who pulled his left groin Monday, could be
out for three to four weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Hidalgo is hitting .227 with 15 home runs and 56 RBIs. He ranks
third on the team in home runs and fifth in RBIs and his 15
outfield assists are second in the majors. He trails only Florida's
Mark Kotsay in throwing out runners.

WWI MESS RAISES SAFETY ISSUES IN 1999 WASHINGTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID GOLDSTEIN  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star   WASHINGTON _ It is a normally quiet
corner of the city, an enclave of wealth and prestige whose winding
leafy lanes and elegant addresses are home to several foreign
ambassadors and other members of the capital's upper crust.
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is also home, however, to some worrisome ghosts from an
antique age, and it's taking more than $25 million and the combined
efforts of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the city to
exorcise them.
</P>
<P>
   Beneath the green lawns and ornamental gardens of the South
Korean ambassador's back yard lies a burial pit for World War I-era
chemical weapons and munitions.
</P>
<P>
   It's a dump, for mortars, smoke bombs and mustard gas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Death Valley'' is how a soldier in 1918 ominously described
the site on the back of an old photograph unearthed several years
ago. The soldier is shown standing on a hillside _ now the
ambassador's back yard _ his face sealed inside a gas mask.
</P>
<P>
   That was 81 years ago. Last month, as the corps' ``Operation
Safe Removal'' continued, some homes had to be evacuated for a few
hours when one of those old, but apparently no less volatile,
chemical agents _ white phosphorus _ ignited and emitted a wraith
of smoke. No one was injured.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been here since 1946,'' said Mary Gibson, who lives down
the street from the ambassador. ``The neighborhood sure has
changed.''
</P>
<P>
   The Spring Valley residents have come to accept the presence of
eerie-looking workers encased in protective suits, the ceaseless
cacophony of industrial noise that accompanies the project, and
their own occasional refugee status.
</P>
<P>
   It started in 1993 when workers laying a sewer pipe uncovered a
cache of chemical munitions. Federal and city agencies evacuated
the immediate neighborhood in the city's upper northwest quadrant.
</P>
<P>
   They found 141 old artillery rounds, including 43 that they
suspected contained chemicals. All were traced to American
University, which sits in the middle of Spring Valley and was an
enlistee in the war effort in 1917.
</P>
<P>
   That was the year when Germany, which had been using toxic gases
against French troops since 1915, introduced mustard gas. Causing
deadly burns and blisters, it raised warfare to a new degree of
horror. The United States, just three months into the war, began a
crash program to keep up with the Germans.
</P>
<P>
   The government leased the campus for the American University
Experiment Station, which became the second-largest chemical
munitions research center in the world.
</P>
<P>
   A team of 1,200 scientists tested 48 toxic or dangerous agents,
including mustard and cyanogen chloride, which poisons the blood.
They dug trenches in the nearby farmland where they staked goats
and dogs as test victims. The scientists hid behind ramshackle
bunkers and shacks, waiting to see which animals would die.
</P>
<P>
   Caution was not a watchword. Chemical bombs would explode, and
traffic and commerce on the nearby streets would go blithely along.
That is until one day in August 1918, when, according to an account
at the time, former Sen. Nathan B. Scott of West Virginia, and his
wife, Agnes, were ``gassed,'' though not injured when a ``cloud''
drifted by their home.
</P>
<P>
   ``The attitudes about hazmat (hazardous materials) was totally
different at that point, socially and legally,'' said Ruth Ann
Overbeck, a land use historian who has researched the history of
the experiment station. ``It was a whole different era.''
</P>
<P>
   The corps spent three years investigating the entire 660-acre
Spring Valley neighborhood after the 1993 discovery, concluding it
was free of chemicals and safe. But the city's environmental health
agency was still leery. It pointed to the 1918 photograph of the
gas mask-wearing soldier bending over a pit containing glass or
ceramic jugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pit, the most feared and respected place in the grounds,''
the soldier wrote on the back of the photograph. ``The bottles are
full of mustard, to be destroyed here. In Death Valley. The hole
called Hades.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``pit,'' officials eventually deduced, was in South Korean
Ambassador Hong-Koo Lee's back yard, which backs up to the American
University campus.
</P>
<P>
   The army found some glass containers, but none with liquid or
jellied mustard or Lewisite, a chemical weapon that destroys tissue
and invades the lungs. The army said the agents could have degraded
over time, but they're still searching for more.
</P>
<P>
   Lewisite, however, is so deadly, said Theodore Gordon, a city
environmental health official, that ``a tablespoon in a room 10 by
10 can kill you in about 30 seconds.''
</P>
<P>
   Workers dumped 200 tons of gravel into the yard last spring to
grade the hillside to allow in cranes and other equipment. But the
actual excavation of the burial pit is done painstakingly by two
workers with shovels. Clad in protective suits with breathing
devices, they have dug out more than 540 drums of contaminated
soil.
</P>
<P>
   The site is enclosed inside a ``vapor containment structure,'' a
Quonset hut-like building, to keep hazardous materials under wraps.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are taking very tight security measures and every care,
so we have confidence in how they have done the job so far,'' said
Jong-Dae Park, a South Korean embassy official.
</P>
<P>
   The corps and the city think they're nearing the end of their
search.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of this is hit-and-miss because we don't know for
sure,'' Gordon said. ``We think we're close to cleaning it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Maj. Brian Plaisted, site manager for the corps of engineers,
said: ``This is kind of a unique situation. During wartime, things
happen, and then 20 years later they start building this really
nice neighborhood and nobody remembers what was there.''
</P>
<P>
   Now it will be a long time before they forget.

MAYOR TAKES ISSUE WITH COUNCILWOMAN'S REMARKS ON POLICE REPORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ALAN SNEL AND KIMBERLY A.C. WILSON  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ A showdown over how Seattle police should investigate
themselves is brewing between Mayor Paul Schell and a councilwoman
who chairs the public safety committee.
</P>
<P>
   A day after an independent panel released a report citing flaws
in the Police Department's internal investigations operations,
Schell on Friday sharply rebuked comments by Councilwoman Tina
Podlodowski who said a proposed plan to monitor the police chief
was not good enough.
</P>
<P>
   Schell said Friday it's his job to play watchdog over Police
Chief Norm Stamper.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Tina was having a bad day,'' Schell said, referring to
Podlodowski's question about who would watch the chief. ``That's
not where the council is going. I'm embarrassed for her.''
</P>
<P>
   The panel's documents suggest a civilian _ not an officer _ run
a new Police Department office called the Office of Professional
Accountability to investigate complaints of police misconduct. The
civilian would be appointed by the police chief, subject to
approval from the city council.
</P>
<P>
   Podlodowski said Thursday she was pleased with the hybrid police
overview of a civilian directing an internal investigation staff
composed of officers. But she was concerned that the new office
would not have watchdog authority over Stamper.
</P>
<P>
   She could not be reached for comment Friday.
</P>
<P>
   One of the panel's four members, lawyer Jenny Durkan, said
Friday that Stamper would be monitored adequately because ``the
chief can be fired at will by the mayor.''
</P>
<P>
   Stamper, at the center of the debate over who ultimately should
police his troops, could not be reached for comment Friday. Members
of the Internal Investigations Section leadership did not reply to
repeated interview requests.
</P>
<P>
   The report by the mayor-appointed panel chides the department
for not properly responding to misconduct complaints, criticizes
officers for failing to appear in court on cases and the chief for
not giving ethics matters ``sufficient priority.''
</P>
<P>
   The panel detailed more than 20 suggestions, including beefing
up ethics training for all officers and conducting face-to-face
interviews between accused officers and internal investigators
instead of the current policy of having accused officers respond to
written questions.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle is one of the few cities that don't conduct in-person
interviews of accused officers, the 37-page report said.
</P>
<P>
   It also recommends that the chief issue a ``bright line''
stating that lying, cheating or stealing by police will not be
tolerated.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing in that report that I was in instant
disagreement,'' Schell said in an interview Friday. He noted the
panel's point about Stamper giving his troops the explicit message
about not lying, cheating or stealing ``was an overstatement made
for emphasis. But you can't say it enough.''
</P>
<P>
   The police union would have to approve many of the panel's
suggestions for them to take effect. Many officers said Friday they
had not read the report, but union leaders expect to discuss it
with rank-and-file officers at a meeting next week.
</P>
<P>
   Schell and Stamper will respond to the panel's report in 30 days
by issuing a game plan for implementing the suggestions. Schell
said his response will show which recommendations can immediately
go into effect and which ones would need police union approval.
</P>
<P>
   While the mayor and the chief began mapping their response, the
city clerk Friday approved a proposed ballot initiative (I-50) that
would ask voters to approve an elected, five-member citizens law
enforcement board. The board would be autonomous from the mayor,
the council, Police Department and the chief.
</P>
<P>
   David Todd Olsen of a group calling itself the Coalition for a
Balanced Government must collect at least 18,830 signatures before
Feb. 16 for the issue to be placed on the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Initiative 50 would empower five paid elected citizens to
``investigate allegations of misconduct or unlawful activities by
Police Department employees, call for and receive the dismissal of
Police Department employees, create and amend certain police
policies, recommend prosecution of Police Department employees, and
establish and direct a special prosecutor's office.''
</P>
<P>
   While the department brass was silent about the panel's report,
line officers weren't.
</P>
<P>
   Many were supportive of recommendations geared to restore
confidence in a department wracked earlier this year by the
revelation that a homicide detective allegedly stole $10,000 from a
crime scene.
</P>
<P>
   But others were skeptical about just how independent the
civilian oversight director could be if the buck still stops with
Stamper.
</P>
<P>
   A sergeant, who declined to be identified, said such an
arrangement ``ain't gonna work.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What good is one more yes person to the chief, when this chief
has closed his eyes to what has been going on all along?'' he
asked.
</P>
<P>
   Another officer who had read the report described it as ``right
on.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The panel sent a message that the supervisors who were in
charge of IIS really haven't been doing a good job.''
</P>
<P>
   After the reported theft came to light in April _ two years
after it reportedly occurred _ the internal investigations section
launched an investigation into Sgt. Don Cameron and Detective Earl
``Sonny'' Davis. In 1996, Davis allegedly took $10,000 from the
home of a man killed in a gunfight with police. When Davis' partner
told Cameron about the theft, the sergeant allegedly helped Davis
return the money the next day.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, who has since retired in the wake of the scandal, goes to
trial Sept. 7 for first-degree theft.
</P>
<P>
   In commenting on the report, Schell said he did not thinking
funding to implement some of the recommendations would be a
problem.
</P>
<P>
   He noted there is money in the city budget that can be
``refocused'' to pay for two new positions and training suggested
by the report.
</P>
<P>
   Councilwoman Margaret Pageler, a former council public safety
chairwoman, said Friday that officers will not appreciate having a
civilian run an internal investigations unit.
</P>
<P>
   Sgt. J.D. Miller, the vice president of the Police Officers
Guild and a former IIS investigator, voiced few complaints about
the report.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're pleased that the report is saying what we've believed
for a long time,'' Miller said without elaborating.

VISITORS TO FRED PHELPS' WEB SITE FIND A SURPRISE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 ROBERT A. CRONKLETON  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Visitors to a
nationally known, anti-homosexual Web site got a surprise when they
tried to connect to the Internet site this week: a message
sympathetic to homosexuals.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Instead of seeing the Web site with ties to the Rev. Fred
Phelps, a Topeka minister who preaches that God hates homosexuals,
people were redirected to a site that promotes itself as a resource
for gay, lesbian, straight, bisexual and transgendered persons of
faith.
</P>
<P>
   An official with the Westboro Baptist Church, where Phelps is
pastor, blamed computer hackers for the switch and said the actions
are criminal.
</P>
<P>
   But a New Hampshire man who runs the pro-gay Web site denied any
wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Late Friday, a notice was placed on the site, promising to
restore access to the Phelps Web page.
</P>
<P>
   According to Network Solutions Inc. of Herndon, Va., a provider
of Web address registration services, ownership of the Phelps Web
site was switched Wednesday from Westboro Baptist Church in Topeka
to Westboro Baptist Church of Newport, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   Traffic to the Phelps Web site also was redirected to the
pro-gay Web site run by Kris Haight of New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Network Solutions is looking into the matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, our security team is investigating it,'' said
Christina Zulandi, senior public relations specialist with Network
Solutions. ``Until then we cannot comment any further.''
</P>
<P>
   Shirley Phelps-Roper, a daughter of Fred Phelps and one of the
church's attorneys, said the action was illegal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a crime to take and mess with people's Web pages,
particularly to try to steal them,'' said Phelps-Roper. Someone
``hacked into an e-mail of the Web master and sent an e-mail to
Network Solutions Inc., telling them to change the ownership of the
Web page....He then made the pronouncement that now he owns the Web
page.''
</P>
<P>
   She said state and federal authorities had been asked to
investigate.
</P>
<P>
   Haight, however, denies any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Haight, who is gay, said he received an anonymous e-mail this
week telling him to pay attention to the registration information
for the Web site run by the Topeka church.
</P>
<P>
   About 3 p.m. Wednesday, he said, the church's ownership of its
domain name was transferred to the Newport church.
</P>
<P>
   A check of Internet databases and directory information listed
no Westboro Baptist Church in Newport. Registration information
from Network Solutions listed the same mailing address for the New
Hampshire church and for Haight's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we are not aware exactly how the domain was transferred,
please note that it was by no action of our own,'' Haight said.
</P>
<P>
   An e-mail announcing the transfer appeared to be both authentic
and legal, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did not hack any servers or Web sites,'' Haight said. ``We
did not hack any e-mail systems.''
</P>
<P>
   Haight said he redirected all traffic trying to access Phelps'
site to the one Haight and his Web site partner started in March.
Haight said that site spreads a message of God's love to people who
have traditionally been inundated with a message of hate. He said
it ``monitors the actions of those who spew hate in the name of
God.''
</P>
<P>
   The addresses for both Phelps' and Haight's Web sites contain a
slur.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Kresha, operations engineer for Verio Kansas City, an
Internet service provider, said it was rare for hackers to be able
to switch the ownership of a domain name, which is more commonly
known as a Web address.
</P>
<P>
   Kresha said changes would have to be initiated by the Web
address owner and even then would have to be handled by e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the e-mail address does not match the controller of that
domain, Network Solutions would reject the changes,'' Kresha said.
</P>
<P>
   Phelps-Roper said it is not uncommon for Phelps' site, which has
about 100,000 visitors a month, to be under attack.
</P>
<P>
   The Anti-Defamation League earlier this year labeled the Phelps
Web site as ``perhaps the most vile and best-known anti-gay Web
site.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a little bit of an inconvenience,'' Phelps-Roper said,
``but it is easily correctable. It takes just 24 or 48 hours.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the dust is settled, she said, the church will continue to
promote its anti-gay ministry.

GALAXY BACK TO FOCUSING ON MLS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM BARRERO  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ No more CONCACAF Champions Cup qualifiers to
worry about, no more U.S. Open Cup matches to ponder and no more
exhibitions.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning tonight, the Galaxy can finally focus on what would
seem to matter most to this franchise _ a drive toward the MLS Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles begins a final stretch run of 10 games against
MLS-only competition with a matchup against the lowly New York/New
Jersey MetroStars tonight at 7:30 at the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   A penalty-kicks loss to Necaxa of Mexico in a Champions Cup
qualifier on Wednesday left the Galaxy without any outside
distractions leading up to the MLS playoffs in mid-October. A
victory would have moved the team on to an eight-team tournament in
Las Vegas at the end of September.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that we're out of this tournament, we need to focus on the
rest of the season and try catching Colorado and hopefully be there
when it's all over,'' Galaxy defender Ezra Hendrickson said.
</P>
<P>
   Said forward Carlos Hermosillo, who plays with Necaxa when not
with the Galaxy: ``Now that this is over, we can begin to focus on
the MLS Cup '99. Our team is playing well and hopefully we will
make a good run toward the cup and bring it home to our fans.''
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles (14-8, 36 points) is second in the Western
Conference behind Colorado and has won nine of its past 11 MLS
games, capturing the league's attention as the Galaxy players have
adapted nicely to coach Sigi Schmid's approach.
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy can creep within three points of the Rapids with a
regulation victory tonight. Colorado lost to Dallas on Wednesday
3-0.
</P>
<P>
   The chance for L.A. to continue its ascent up the conference
standings appears to be good, considering N.Y./N.J. has not
defeated a Western Conference opponent on the road since April 17,
1998 in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   The MetroStars lead the league in shots taken (390), but are
last in goals scored (21).

DEATH SENTENCED COMMUTED, FAYE COPELAND DREAMS OF POSSIBLE
FREEDOM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LEE HILL KAVANAUGH  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VANDALIA, Mo. _ Birthdays don't matter in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Faye Copeland's Aug. 4 birthday was just another notch in her
life, a grim reminder that 78 years had passed since she was born
in an Arkansas log cabin.
</P>
<P>
   Like every day in prison, she rose at 5 a.m. along with 1,402
other incarcerated women. She tended to seedlings in the
greenhouse.
</P>
<P>
   That's her prison job. It's also her life. But there was one
difference in this 24-hour span.
</P>
<P>
   In the Kansas City federal courthouse some 220 miles away was a
stack of papers holding one of the best birthday presents Copeland
may ever get _ a judge's commutation of her death sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Barring an appeal from Attorney General Jay Nixon within 45 days
of the judgment, Copeland won't die by lethal injection.
</P>
<P>
   The commutation was only a partial victory, say her attorneys,
Sean O'Brien and Kent Gibson, who filed the petition in January
1998. Although U.S. District Judge Ortrie Smith commuted her death
sentence, agreeing with some of the issues Copeland's attorneys
raised, he upheld the punishment of life without parole.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday her attorneys filed more paperwork in U.S. District
Court, petitioning for a new trial based on information that her
jury never heard.
</P>
<P>
   They argue she was the victim of 50 years of abuse from her
husband, Ray.
</P>
<P>
   A great-grandmother 21 times over, she once won second place in
the Ozark Empire Fair for her pickled beets and still dreams of
returning to her farmhouse in Mooresville, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, prosecutors paint a far different picture of Copeland,
until two weeks ago the oldest woman on death row.
</P>
<P>
   Nine years ago she was convicted of first-degree murder for her
role in one of the largest serial murder cases in Missouri history.
Prosecutors said she was deeply involved in the killings of five
transients whose bodies were unearthed near her farm.
</P>
<P>
   Her attorneys admit a new trial is a long shot. But even its
possibility gives hope to Copeland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wouldn't you?'' Copeland said this week to visitors.
``Everyone hopes, even just to see another day. Nothing's
guaranteed in this life 'cept dying.''
Life on the inside
</P>
<P>
   The Women's Eastern Reception, Diagnostic and Correctional
Center in Vandalia is a 47-acre complex of blood-red buildings.
Opened in December 1997, the prison is a state-of-the-art facility
and one of the newest in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Faye Copeland was transferred here from the Chillicothe
Correctional Center almost a year ago, because a relative was
working there.
</P>
<P>
   Softening the edges of the Vandalia prison's razor-wire fences
are hundreds of marigolds, zinnias, euonymus and barberry bushes,
all raised by hand from prisoner 000888003.
</P>
<P>
   To inmates she is known as ``Mrs. Faye.'' To the outside world,
she is ``the murderer.''
</P>
<P>
   Copeland has been in prison since her arrest and conviction in
1990 for a scheme with her husband, Ray, involving cattle, bad
checks and five murdered transients, killings that she maintains
her deceased husband committed without her knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   Jurors thought otherwise, convicting her of first-degree murder
and sentencing her to death.
</P>
<P>
   Kenny Hulshof, the co-prosecutor, called the Copeland couple
20th century cattle rustlers. Abuse in Faye Copeland's life was
never an issue, he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time, the law for battered spouse syndrome only applied
to cases involving self-defense,'' he says.``And all these claims
of abuse by the family members did not come out until after Ray's
death, after Ray could no longer defend himself....
</P>
<P>
   ``We found that Faye was an equal partner with Ray. Yes, Ray was
a gruff old farmer. But Faye is not a meek demure woman, just a
woman who knew hard times.''
A tolerable life
</P>
<P>
   At the prison's visiting room, an alarm sounds announcing an
arrival. Entering is a gray-headed woman, walking with concerted
steps past vending machines and several walls of visiting rules.
</P>
<P>
   Faye Copeland's face reflects a mix of dull despair, anger and
fear. After a brief smile, her lips draw into a thin line.
</P>
<P>
   She is wary of interviews, especially after a ``60 Minutes''
piece where she was portrayed as the picture of the American Gothic
gone bad.
</P>
<P>
   But her full story, the one of the abuse and battering that the
jurors didn't hear a decade ago, needs to be heard, her attorneys
say. So, they urge her to talk about her life.
</P>
<P>
   The basis of her petition rests on the fact that evidence of her
abuse was never introduced at the trial.
</P>
<P>
   She shakes hands with her visitors, with the soft grip of a
78-year-old woman who has diabetes and a heart condition.
</P>
<P>
   Life is very different than on the farm, she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't have flowers at home,'' she says. ``He didn't like
me to be tending to anything other than him. As long as I was with
him or working the cattle or the tractor that was OK. But flowers,
no, he didn't like them.''
</P>
<P>
   As she speaks, her voice is barely louder than a whisper.
Voicing her own opinion, she says, wasn't what a wife should do if
her husband didn't like it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was raised to love my husband and support him no matter
what,'' she says. ``The man is the head of the family. The Bible
says it should be that way. It wouldn't do to say if Ray was mean
to me or not....Yes, he did mess up my life, but that's not to say
that I wasn't a good wife to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was never mean to him....Maybe we'd have got along better if
I had knocked the hell out of him a few times.''
</P>
<P>
   She laughs at that thought. Then her hands rub at an age spot on
her arm. She squints out the window where blue skies advertise a
beautiful day. Again, her lips return to their tight line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like talkin' with the media because 90 percent of the
time wasn't nothin' said right,'' she says. ``Just tell the truth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll give you that probably the worst mistake of my life was
marrying him,'' she says. Ray Copeland, 78, died in 1993 before the
state could execute him.
</P>
<P>
   ``But life can be good or it can be bad. It's what you make of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Except for Christmases and her children's birthdays, prison life
for her is tolerable.
</P>
<P>
   `You didn't ask'
</P>
<P>
   Minding your own business was the family motto, says Al
Copeland, 51, who lives in Chillicothe and was the Copelands'
fourth child.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mom didn't know about the killings, just like I didn't know
about them,'' he says. ``I do think she knew about Ray's cattle
scams. You've got to understand if we asked him anything about his
business, he beat the snot out of us. It was understood _ you
didn't ask.''
</P>
<P>
   Prison for his mother is an ironic twist in her life, he says,
because living with Ray prepared her for prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's using the same type of emotion in prison that she used
with him,'' says Copeland. ``She looked away then when things went
on. She stuck to her business. All the same things she does in
prison now.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they tell her to do something, she does it and doesn't
complain, just as she did with Ray. I don't see a bit of
difference. I think prison is probably better for her than home.
Nobody abuses her there.''
</P>
<P>
   Jurors were convinced of Faye Copeland's guilt when the
prosecution turned up a handwritten list of farmhands in her
writing, hidden in a camera case.
</P>
<P>
   She had written the names because Ray Copeland was illiterate.
There were 12 names with scrawled X's by them and other names with
the word ``back'' next to them, her lawyers say.
</P>
<P>
   Five of the men with an X by their names turned up dead.
</P>
<P>
   Four other transients marked with an X police later found alive
and well, her lawyers say, and three men's whereabouts are still a
mystery. Prosecutors believe they were buried near the others.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was this sinister X next to names...'' recalls Hulshof,
now a U.S. representative. ``It refutes this woman who was caught
in the circumstances and shows her as much more of an accomplice
than she claimed.''
</P>
<P>
   Early in the trial Faye Copeland was offered a plea agreement.
In exchange for telling where the other three men were buried, she
would have been able to walk out a free woman. But she told
authorities she couldn't tell them where anybody was, because she
didn't know.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Copeland had a long history of writing bad checks, going in
and out of prisons since the 1930s and disappearing for two to
three days at a time, says Sean O'Brien, Faye Copeland's attorney.
</P>
<P>
   ``Faye is just as much a victim of Ray's conduct as are those
men planted in the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Hulshof, however, says Faye Copeland may have stood up to her
husband more than she lets on. Neighbors reported hearing her curse
at Ray when working with him.
</P>
<P>
   The list of X's spooks Al Copeland.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Ray would have been arrested in 1987, I'd probably been
arrested too, because in 1986 I was going to the sale barns with
him and the hired hands, '' he says. ``I was writing down the names
and told to put X's by the men who ran off.''
</P>
<P>
   Copeland regrets his testimony at his mother's trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``They asked me if I ever saw her abused,'' he says. ``I told
them no. But I wasn't allowed to say why.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Ray got in one of his moods, we all scattered. My
brothers and sister never saw Ray hit me either. That was our
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Al Copeland says he has his own brutal memories.
</P>
<P>
   At 10, his father beat him with a claw hammer because he handed
him the wrong tool, he says.
</P>
<P>
   Another time, he was milking cows and a cow kicked over her
bucket. Al Copeland still suffers back pain from that beating by
his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``My family was very different from most families,'' he says.
Beyond prison walls
</P>
<P>
   Faye Copeland's words tumble and stop, like a square-wheeled
cart bouncing over a gravel road. But always, always, looming
somewhere in her answers is the knowledge of everything she is
missing.
</P>
<P>
   It's apparent when she talks about her grandchildren and
great-grandchildren, including ``three more on the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago was the very best day she's had yet in prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cried all day, all the night and half the next day,'' she
says about the news that her life was spared. ``Now I'm waiting for
the next one.''
</P>
<P>
   Her attorneys are working and she is hoping. But she only shakes
her head when asked if she ever thought her life would end up this
way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've often thought since, maybe this was the for the best,''
she says. ``Where did I go wrong, if I went wrong? I know one place
was getting married at all. But he was my life for many, many
years. I didn't know nothing else.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will I get out? I may go out feet first but I'll get out of
here. Someday.''

single door. It's the door that makes this car something of a
unique entity, at least something that I'd never heard of: a
three-door coupe.
</P>
<P>
   Leave it to Saturn to create a big wave from a small innovation.
That's been the story with this company since it was started by
General Motors almost a decade ago as a private corporation
dedicated to building a new small car, as well as creating a new
corporate culture and dealership experience.
</P>
<P>
   The real news at Saturn for 2000 is the introduction of its
first midsize car, the LS sedan and wagon, to supplement its
compact SL sedan, wagon and SC coupe. But there's still some
applause left for Saturn's innovation of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Really, there is so little in the automotive world that is truly
singular or unique, once you get past such sideshows as the Dodge
Viper and the New Beetle. Doors are all the rage, of course, now
that stretch-cab pickups require four doors and minivans must have
sliding passenger doors on both sides. All the Saturn coupes are
now being built as three-doors.
</P>
<P>
   The third door on the SC is one of those deft strokes that makes
you go, ``Hey, why didn't I think of that?'' The third-door setup
on the Saturn is akin to the rear doors on those stretch-cab
pickups, rear-hinged and opening backwards, to allow access to the
back seat. Not quite a real back door, but a reasonable facsimile.
</P>
<P>
   Putting it behind the driver's door also was smart. Even though
it doesn't open at the curb for passenger entry, the third door and
its backward opening configuration make it convenient for the
driver to gain access to the rear seat, even more so than a normal
four-door.
</P>
<P>
   The driver's door has to be opened before the third door can
open, but once it is, there is no pillar in the center to get in
the way.
</P>
<P>
   A major complaint: There is no handle or any other provision for
the passenger in the rear seat to open the door. That is a
significant omission, which can result in pinched fingers and hard
feelings.
</P>
<P>
   Rear-hinged doors of any kind were once referred to as ``suicide
doors'' because in the event of crash, they were likely to pop open
and the nearest occupant would fly through the opening. But that
was before the widespread use of seat belts. Now that anybody with
half a brain is wearing a seat belt, it's kind of a moot point.
</P>
<P>
   The third door is more a cosmetic consideration than anything
else, allowing a driver to zip around in a stylish, sporty coupe
without anyone knowing that it's also practical. It's hard to spot
the third door because it's so blended in with the body line, the
only clue being the rear seam where it opens.
</P>
<P>
   But here's a question: Why just three doors? Why not four? Why
not have this interesting clamshell setup on both sides of the car,
making it a four-door coupe? Of course, that doesn't sound nearly
as interesting or quirky as a three-door coupe.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the third door, the Saturn is a nice driving little
car that's surprisingly roomy behind the wheel. The test car was
the less-expensive SC1, with its 100-horsepower four-cylinder
engine, rather than the SC2, with slightly more powerful
dual-overhead-cam four, which creates 124 horsepower.
</P>
<P>
   The lesser engine, a single-overhead-cam four, was originally a
noisy, underpowered critter that I always recommended against. But
Saturn has done an admirable job of civilizing its base engine, and
I found the SC1 to be powerful enough and fun to drive. Gas mileage
is excellent.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the fun-to-drive quotient was a stick-shift
transmission. Saturn started out with one of the nicest shifting
manuals in the business, and it still rates as one of the best. I'm
unsure how the SC1 would perform with an automatic, but I'd wager
on the side of anemic.
</P>
<P>
   Ride and handling are decent, and the steering is quick enough
and responsive enough to give the SC a good, sporty feel.
</P>
<P>
   The coupe styling is sharp and edgy, even aggressive-looking in
a small-car sort of way. The third door is essentially invisible,
unless you're looking for it.
</P>
<P>
   The price is right for this little coupe, even with the fair
load of optional equipment on the test car. One of those options
was antilock brakes, which certainly should be standard. GM was a
pioneer in offering standard antilock on moderately priced cars,
and Saturn should be no different.
</P>
<P>
   Saturn has suffered during recent years from not moving forward
and creating a new generation of cars to supplement its original
team. The LS should rectify that, giving Saturn owners something to
move up to and attracting a new group of people who prefer a
midsize car.
</P>
<P>
   The three-door coupe is also a revolutionary move.
</P>
<P>
   So does the inclusion of the third door make the SC1 a practical
family car? Not really, since the back seat is still limited in
both headroom and legroom. It is still a coupe, after all. &QL;

PARAMEDIC, TEENS IN SHOOTING RAMPAGE LAUDED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY TROY ANDERSON  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BURBANK -- Four teen-age camp counselors from the North Valley
Jewish Community Center and a Los Angeles Fire Department paramedic
were honored at Temple Beth Emet Reform of Burbank for helping the
center's children during the Aug. 10 shooting rampage at the
center's day camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see sitting before you the epitome of good deeds that day
and every day,'' said Rabbi Mark Sobel on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   With about 75 people attending the evening service, Sobel and
others paid tribute to the counselors, Bryan Benmaor, 18; Jennifer
Benmaor, 23; Michelle Markiz, 18; and Gabriel Schkliar, 18; and to
Fire Department Station 87 Paramedic Todd Carb.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great, I didn't expect this,'' said Schkliar. He reported
that the children injured in the shooting are doing fine. The boy
who was shot in the foot is a ``speed demon on his crutches now,''
he said. ``They all have smiles on their faces.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Pasadena, presented the five with
Senate Certificates of Recognition, Sobel gave Carb a silver-plated
Torah. The paramedic carried it through the congregation as people
touched it for a blessing with their prayer books and shawls.
</P>
<P>
   Carb was the first firefighter to reach Benjamin Kadish, the
5-year-old boy most seriously injured in the shooting attack
allegedly committed by white supremacist Buford O'Neal Furrow Jr.
Carb, who is stationed two miles from the center, is credited with
helping save the boy's life.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a tradition in Judaism,'' Sobel said. ``If you save a
life, you save the world. Judaism has a prayer for thanking God for
saving one from danger. We wanted to honor them for being
custodians of the children.''
</P>
<P>
   Furrow is facing federal and state charges naming him as the
gunman who shot and injured the children and staff members at the
Granada Hills center camp and in the shooting death of a mail
carrier afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Bryan Benmaor and Schkliar were on opposite sides of the
building with about 95 children when the shots were first fired,
Sobel said.
</P>
<P>
   When they heard the shots, they hurried the children onto two
buses and the driver drove them to safety at a Northridge Park,
Sobel said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bus driver got off and said, `Load the buses,' and we got
all the little kids on the buses and then we left,'' Schkliar said.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, Bryan Benmaor and Schkliar sang songs with the
children to keep their minds off what had happened.
</P>
<P>
   Markiz was the counselor who had a group of children at the
Simon Wiesenthal Center's Museum of Tolerance on a field trip that
day.
</P>
<P>
   ``She kept calm and order at the museum after learning what
happened,'' Sobel said.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Benmoar was inside the building with some children and
kept them out of danger, Sobel said.
</P>
<P>
   Sobel said they decided to honor the teen-agers and Carb as a
way to ``move away from the violence and talk about saving lives.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to pray with them and help them heal,'' Sobel said. &QL;

ILLEGALS ACCUSE FIRM OF BIAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   For months, the women say, they endured sexual harassment, an
endless torrent of racial slurs, a subminimum wage in sweatshop
conditions, even a demeaning mandatory strip-search.
</P>
<P>
   But because they were illegal immigrants from Mexico and
Guatemala, they never complained about the owners of a Gilbert
print-painting factory, fearing they would be deported.
</P>
<P>
   Now, they're fighting back. The women are preparing a lawsuit
against the owners of Quality Art Manufacturing, alleging not only
sexual and verbal abuse, but also seeking minimum wages and
overtime, said Stephen Montoya, their attorney.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just sheer exploitation. I fear this is not the only
employer in the Valley and state that is engaging in this type of
conduct,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   John Burns, one of the company's owners, acknowledged hiring
illegal workers but said he is attempting to remedy the problem. He
denied abusing any workers.
</P>
<P>
   The women have filed complaints with the federal Equal
Opportunity Employment Commission.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, commission investigators acted on their complaints,
serving the lithography company with a notice of investigation
involving racial and sexual discrimination, along with subpoenas
for personnel records.
</P>
<P>
   Sue Grace, an EEOC spokeswoman, said hefty fines can be leveled
against companies with discriminatory practices. She said the
agency's investigations usually take about six months. Negotiated
settlements usually are sought, but firms are prosecuted in U.S.
District Court, if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   The women sought legal help after the firing of a sympathetic
supervisor triggered a revolt reminiscent of coal miners a century
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody got angry,'' said Beatrice Colores, 34, a former
supervisor for Quality Art. ``I kept getting myself in trouble
defending them.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got fired, they all walked out. They were standing
behind me. They said they weren't going to take it anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Owner John Burns said Colores was fired for lying and
threatening a fellow employee.
</P>
<P>
   Company attorneys eventually will prove the discrimination
charges are without merit, Burns said.
</P>
<P>
   During the Aug. 5 uprising, the women resigned en masse.
</P>
<P>
   Montoya said he will file a civil lawsuit against Quality Art on
behalf of the former employees, seeking a substantial settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The purpose of this case is to stop this type of behavior and
to let employers know this is not a profitable way of doing
business,'' Montoya said.
</P>
<P>
   When she was hired in May, Colores said she was told the company
knew the workers were illegal but hired them anyway. The hours were
6 a.m to 9:30 p.m., with a half-hour for lunch and two 10-minute
breaks. Hours increased to 7 a.m. to 11:30 p.m. during busy
periods.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was told that this was a sweatshop, and it was going to be
run as a sweatshop,'' Colores said.
</P>
<P>
   But Jim Burns, John Burns' brother and an owner of Quality Art,
said his records will prove the workers were paid at least minimum
wage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the people making these accusations were making $6 and
$7 an hour,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Burns said his shop is not a hostile or abusive workplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is going to have their own beliefs of what is
acceptable or unacceptable,'' he said. ``I don't think there is
anything here but trying to be fair.''
</P>
<P>
   John Burns said he is ``very personally offended'' by the
discrimination charges. He said he held Christmas parties for the
workers at his home and gave them cash advances on numerous
occasions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not a single prejudicial word has ever come out of my mouth,''
he added.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews and affidavits, the former workers tell a
different story.
</P>
<P>
   In the affidavits, the women tell of being called ``stupid
Mexicans'' and ``wetbacks'' repeatedly by Jim and John Burns.
</P>
<P>
   Maria Josephina Gonzalez Solis said in her affidavit that the
racially derogatory statements included ``that we didn't have
rights . . . and that we are in America and not Mexico.''
</P>
<P>
   When the women demanded overtime on Memorial Day, Colores said,
the owners ``told them . . . they did not know what Memorial Day
meant, that this was an American holiday, not a stupid Mexican
holiday.''
</P>
<P>
   Solis said she was humiliated by the April 12 strip-search,
performed by supervisors of the same gender when $1,000 was
reported missing.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, it was like they were making fun of me,'' Solis said
through an interpreter. ``I felt bad. Why are they doing this to
us?''
</P>
<P>
   Maria Elena Osorio Rodriguez, who is from Guatemala, described
sexual harassment in her affidavit.
</P>
<P>
   ``One day in June 1999, when all the workers were in line ready
to punch out from work, John passed and touched my buttocks,'' she
said. ``Touching the female workers on the buttocks was a daily
occurrence.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the most chilling accusations are those of Maria De La Luz
Gonzalez, 22, of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   John Burns ``would always pass me on purpose and touch my
butt,'' she said through a translator.
</P>
<P>
   One day, she was showing another employee how to do a job and
accidentally ripped a lithograph.
</P>
<P>
   ``John Burns hit me across the face because he did not like the
work I was doing,'' she said in her affidavit.
</P>
<P>
   A Spanish-speaking supervisor told Gonzalez that the slap was
``just a joke,'' she said, an accusation she didn't buy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very angry. I wanted to cry, but I held it back,''
Gonzalez said.
</P>
<P>
   John Burns said he was flabbergasted by her accusations, adding
that he is happily married to a beautiful woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody knows my character,'' he said. ``I would never, ever
touch a woman's butt.''
</P>
<P>
   Colores was born in Douglas and raised in Chandler Heights,
where she toiled as a migrant worker during summers and on
weekends. Despite her lowly position, Colores said she was never
ridiculed with racial slurs and never felt the sting of racism
until she worked for Quality Art.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was always angry,'' she said. ``I would tell the employees
that they don't have to put up with this.'' &QL;

 SOX-BOS  
 Rangers thwart Red Sox  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ In hindsight, Mark Portugal's impetuous
decision to retire, which he rescinded a few days later, has been
one of the milder misadventures to befall Red Sox starters this
season. But that was of little consolation to him Friday night,
when he pitched just well enough to lose to the Texas Rangers, 4-3,
before 35,036 in The Ballpark at Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's funny,'' said Portugal, who spotted the Rangers two runs
in the second and another pair in the third, then combined with
Rich Garces to shut out the Rangers on three hits over the last
five innings. ``But someone said I haven't been getting any love,
so to speak.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody's got to go loveless, and I guess it's me.''
</P>
<P>
   Portugal might have felt less forlorn if the Sox had been able
to cash in on either of their last two scoring chances. But John
Valentin, compounding the 3-for-28 slump he's in, apparently missed
a hit-and-run sign in the seventh, leaving Jose Offerman to be
gunned down by All-Star catcher Ivan Rodriguez. Then, with two out
in the ninth, pinch hitter Reggie Jefferson singled and Trot Nixon,
who drove in two runs with sacrifice flies, walked, but Offerman
flied out on John Wetteland's next pitch, giving the Rangers'
closer his 34th save.
</P>
<P>
   ``The team tried to come back,'' said Portugal, whose record
dropped to 7-11, ``but we came up short.''
</P>
<P>
   Think of all that has happened to the five pitchers who opened
the season in the rotation. Pedro Martinez, of course, touched off
a firestorm this past week when the manager gave him a tardy slip
instead of a start. Bret Saberhagen has been on the disabled list
twice, once after stepping on broken glass at a team party he was
hosting, and his shoulder seems to be hanging by a thread. Tim
Wakefield went to the bullpen to take the place of injured closer
Tom Gordon; what he thought would be temporary service became a
14-week tour of duty.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Rapp was banished to the bullpen, was restored to the
rotation, and now is pitching in between vigils at the bedside of
his ailing wife, Rebecca, who is dealing with a difficult
pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, Portugal has muddled along, rarely stringing
together good games, but at least showing up when called upon, his
23 starts improbably the most on the team. The 36-year-old
righthander was ready to jump ship in June to become a stay-at-home
dad, but here it is nearing the end of August, and he's still
pitching games that count.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather lead this team in innings than starts,'' he said.
``All that means is I haven't been hurt. I've been a pretty
fortunate man all my life. They say it all evens out. I guess I'll
just have to wait for it to change direction.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers scored twice in the second inning on Rafael
Palmeiro's 34th home run, then twice more in the third inning on
four singles, the last three with two out, including Palmeiro's RBI
hit.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers, fresh from taking three out of four games from the
AL Central-leading Indians and owners of the best record in the
league since the All-Star break (24-11), appeared poised to apply
even more heat on the sweating Portugal, already coping with
91-degree temperatures at game time (the Sox caught a break; after
23 straight days of 100-degree readings, Fridat topped out at only
98).
</P>
<P>
   A fine time to quit? Not for Portugal, who allowed just two hits
over the next three innings, giving the Sox time to start
counterpunching against Esteban Loaiza, the Mexican-born
righthander who has become the Rangers' most reliable starter since
the All-Star break, spinning off five straight wins.
</P>
<P>
   DH Butch Huskey, who continues to make a strong case for regular
playing time, led off the fifth with his 19th home run, fourth in
46 at-bats with the Sox. Jason Varitek then drew a walk, Darren
Lewis singled him to third, and Trot Nixon's sacrifice fly brought
him home to make it 4-2.
</P>
<P>
   Loiaza wasn't out of trouble yet. He walked Offerman, and after
Valentin looked at a third strike, Nomar Garciaparra walked to load
the bases. But Mike Stanley, who had struck out his first two
at-bats, flied deep to the track to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis's triple off Juan Gonzalez's glove to open the seventh
finished Loiaza. Nixon's second sacrifice fly of the night, this
one off Mike Munoz, made it 4-3. Offerman walked, leading Rangers
manager Johnny Oates to summon another reliever, Tim Crabtree.
Offerman, who last season stole 45 bases, then set out for second
while Valentin looked at Crabtree's pitch. Offerman still nearly
made it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't swing,'' Williams said of Valentin, ``so I guess he
missed the sign.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentin then popped out, ending the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Portugal, having thrown 95 pitches, parted after the sixth,
giving way to Garces, who loaded the bases on a single and two
walks, but then induced Palmeiro to pop out to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Garces got the equivalent of a Billy Blanks tae-bo workout in
the eighth, when he scrambled to field Todd Zeile's roller along
the first-base line and tagged Zeile out, then had to hustle over
to cover first on Lee Stevens' bouncer to first. Jimy Williams,
figuring his pitcher needed a little breather, came out for a visit
while Garces was pitching to Royce Clayton, who ended up looking at
a third strike from El Guapo.

YOUNG IS ON JOHNSON PLAN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Los Angeles Dodgers manager Davey Johnson glossed
over Eric Young' return from the disabled list by saying the second
baseman would get his starting job back _ though it would come with
a few more rests to keep the 32-year-old spry.
</P>
<P>
   However, more than a week after Young's return it's clear the
second base position has evolved into exactly what Johnson
envisioned a month ago _ a platoon.
</P>
<P>
   Young's been back for seven games, and after sitting through
Friday's 8-5 win in 10 innings against Philadelphia, he's started
just four of them.
</P>
<P>
   And it doesn't have much to do with Young not playing well. He's
6 for 16 with four walks, three stolen bases and three runs scored.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm on his plan,'' Young said of Johnson. ``Whatever he
wants.''
</P>
<P>
   During the season the Dodgers have become disenchanted with
Young because, as a leadoff hitter, they think he hits too many
balls in the air. Defensively, the team believes he lacks range.
</P>
<P>
   The situation came to a head last month in Arizona when Johnson
said he was making a switch at second base to give Young time to
heal his bumps and bruises. Young asked to go on the disabled list
but the Dodgers didn't want to place him there because he couldn't
be traded.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, three days before the July 31 non-waiver trading
deadline, the Dodgers placed Young on the disabled list with a
sprained ankle.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberthal signs: The Phillies signed catcher Mike Lieberthal, a
Westlake High graduate, to a three-year, $19 million contract
extension before the game. There's also a club option for the 2003
season at $7.25 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main reason I want to stay here is the players we have
here, and the coaching staff and the general manager,'' said
Lieberthal, a first-round pick of the Phillies in 1990. ``We have a
chance to win here the next few years. We've had some injuries here
lately, but there are a lot of parts in place. No longer are we a
handful of players away from winning.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberthal, 27, was a career .252 hitter in 310 games spanning
five seasons before breaking out this year. He was named to the NL
all-star squad this summer and entered the Dodgers' series hitting
.310 with 25 homers and 78 RBI. He also leads NL catchers with a
.999 fielding percentage. He's committed one error this season and
hasn't made one in 84 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike's a prime example of what we've been trying to do here,''
Phillies general manager Ed Wade said. ``We made a commitment a
couple of years ago to build around our young nucleus. ...I think
this is a clear signal that we're going to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberthal makes $2.2 million this season. He was given a $1
million signing bonus and will be paid $4.5 million next year, $6
million in 2001 and $7 million in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Extra bases: Dodgers right-hander Robinson Checo (groin) threw
66 pitches in a rehab assignment for Single-A San Bernardino on
Thursday. He allowed six runs on four hits in three innings against
Rancho Cucamonga.... Former Dodgers lefty Carlos Perez, now the
highest-paid pitcher in the minors, allowed six runs (four earned)
in a loss Thursday for Triple-A Albuquerque against Tucson. Perez
allowed 11 hits, walked two, struck out one and allowed a homer.
Johnson said Perez needs one or two more starts before returning to
the Dodgers, making him a prime Sept. 1 call-up.... Former Dodgers
right-hander Hideo Nomo is slated to start the series opener for
Milwaukee against the Dodgers on Monday.

EX_UCLA COUNSELOR CONVICTED IN THEFT OF PAINTING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DOUGLAS HABERMAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- A federal jury on Friday convicted former UCLA
counseling director Jane Crawford, 50, on charges related to the
theft from the university of a 19th-century painting valued at
$250,000.
</P>
<P>
   The jury found the Van Nuys woman guilty on four felony charges
_ two counts of wire fraud relating to the faxing of sales
documents and two counts of interstate transportation of property
obtained through fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Crawford, who remains free without bail until her Nov. 8
sentencing, faces time in a federal prison, Assistant U.S. Attorney
Ranee Katzenstein said. But she couldn't say how long the sentence
is likely to be. The statutory maximum is 30 years, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a significant case,'' Katzenstein said, ``in that it has
a significant message to send: You don't take property from your
employer just because nobody will notice.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the University of California, Los Angeles, acquired the
painting in 1928 but ``there happened not to be a precise inventory
record of this painting.''
</P>
<P>
   Crawford knew that and took advantage of it, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the jury did its job,'' Katzenstein said. ``I believe
the evidence was overwhelming.''
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorney Lawrence Strauss said his client is probably
facing 18 months in prison. He plans to appeal to the 9th District
U.S. Court of Appeals, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm disappointed in the verdict,'' he said. There was a lack
of evidence to show Crawford stole the painting from the
university, Strauss said, and a lack of evidence UCLA even owns the
painting.
</P>
<P>
   He said Crawford would not be available for comment.
</P>
<P>
   The painting at the center of the case is a 19th-century piece
by Arthur Wesley Dow called ``Frost Flowers, Ipswitch 1889.'' Dow
was an artist and influential art educator who died in 1922. His
widow donated the painting to UCLA in 1928, Katzenstein said.
</P>
<P>
   Crawford claimed a UCLA official offered her the painting after
it had hung in his house for 10 years. She hung it in her office
then took it home in 1993, eventually storing it at her father's
house.
</P>
<P>
   When her father fell ill, now-deceased attorney Ken Weaver was
handling the liquidation of his assets and said he could sell it
for cash, Strauss said.
</P>
<P>
   Weaver sold it in 1994 to a New York gallery for $200,000, which
sold it shortly thereafter for $300,000, Katzenstein said.
</P>
<P>
   Katzenstein alleged Jane Crawford sold the painting through
Weaver to avoid having her name tied to the sale.
</P>
<P>
   Weaver and Crawford had a falling out, and Weaver told the Los
Angeles Police Department's art theft squad that the painting was
stolen from UCLA. The FBI later joined in the investigation and the
painting is now in the custody of the FBI's Los Angeles office,
Katzenstein said.
</P>
<P>
   A federal civil suit over ownership of the painting is now
making its way through the courts, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Today, UCLA has very specific and detailed inventory procedures
for all noncash gifts and regularly audits its inventories, said
Harlan Lebo, director of communications for the College of Letters
and Science. ``The message is: UCLA is an extremely safe place to
give a noncash gift,'' he said.

WILD WINSTON WEST RETURNS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEITH LAIR  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRWINDALE, Calif. _ When NASCAR Winston West cars made their
initial pit stops at Irwindale Speedway on June 19, NASCAR
officials went crazy.
</P>
<P>
   Cars entering pit road were credited with an extra lap upon
exiting because they re-entered before the pace car passed. Cars
entering a lap down emerged among the top 5. It was chaos as
officials and lap-counters took nearly 20 minutes to sort out the
correct order.
</P>
<P>
   The track's scoreboard resembled a bingo board, car numbers
bouncing up and down, back and forth. On the track, cars kept
swapping orders at officials' whims.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, NASCAR officials blamed the track's transponders for
the scoring error.
</P>
<P>
   ``The transponders worked fine,'' track competition director
Jeff Schrader recalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, (officials) figured out what was happening early
on,'' Winston West spokesman Kevin Green said.
</P>
<P>
   So when cars exit the pits for tonight's $105,644 Snap-On Tools
250, which benefits the City of Hope, a NASCAR official will make
certain the pace car has passed, a practice employed at the end of
the first Irwindale race.
</P>
<P>
   ``It won't happen again,'' Green said of pit problems.
</P>
<P>
   However, the racing is likely to be just as wacky as last time.
In the Irwindale debut there were 26 lead changes among nine
drivers, a series record for a half-mile track. Steve Portegna
pulled off the victory with a last-lap pass to win by half a car
length.
</P>
<P>
   A sixth-place finish in Portland last week put Saugus' Sean
Woodside in the season points lead, 31 ahead of Mike Chase. Only
217 points separate first from 10th place after nine of 14 events.
</P>
<P>
   Portegna averaged 69.93 mph for the 125-lap race last time here.
Butch Gilliland of Chino Hills was on the pole, going 100.722 mph
in front of 6,247, the largest Irwindale crowd other than the 6,500
opening-night show.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight, fans will be able to watch the final practice session _
gates open at 2 p.m. with practice starting at 2:30 p.m. Qualifying
is at 5 p.m. and an autograph session with all drivers follows at
6. Racing begins at 7 with the Mechanix Wear Speed Truck Challenge
and the American Cities Racing League is also scheduled to compete.
</P>
<P>
   Also signing autographs will be Craftsman Truck driver Rick
Carelli, who suffered a near career-ending head injury at Memphis
earlier this summer. The Denver resident will be making his first
public appearance since the accident, doing so on behalf of High
Hopes, a foundation which specializes in the rehabilitation of
head-injury victims.

HUNTER LOOKS BACK FOR HELP ON SWING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Brian Hunter was missing pitches right down the middle
of the plate. They were pitches he used to hit _ the kind most
major leaguers devour _ but Hunter was helpless. By the end of the
Mariners' road trip, the left fielder had just three hits over his
previous 41 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   So Hunter and his family did some research. He called his mother
in Vancouver, Wash., and asked her to find some videotapes from his
minor league days. His sister delivered them to Seattle when Hunter
returned from the road. And from his personal collection, Hunter
found five baseball cards that depicted him batting as a Houston
Astros rookie in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   To Hunter, it was hard evidence that he had abandoned his
natural hitting technique.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've hit .250 the last couple of years, and that's not me,''
said Hunter, who was batting .244 before Friday night's game.
``I've been playing since I was 5 years old, and ever since I got
to the big leagues I've tried to do something different. So I sat
back and said, well, if I'm going to get out as many times as I've
been getting out, I'm at least going to do it the way I got here. I
know I can help contribute more on offense than I've been doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Mariners hitting coach Jesse Barfield said he'd been urging
Hunter to return to his roots for a month. When Hunter presented
Barfield with the old baseball cards, the coach had flashbacks.
</P>
<P>
   The photos on the cards were taken from a first-base angle _
near where Barfield stood as Houston's first-base coach that year.
He recognized the exagerrated knee kick and, especially, Hunter's
hands, which were near his ear and not near the back of his head,
where they've been much of this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything's in a better position,'' Barfield said, examining
the cards. ``You can't have the bat wrapped around your head unless
you're Juan Gonzalez or Julio Franco. Even Edgar (Martinez) doesn't
wrap the bat around his head. It's up high, but it's not wrapped.
Nobody can hit from that wrapped position _ that's too long a
distance to travel.''
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday in batting practice, Hunter displayed a pronounced
up-down hitch with his hands, which were nowhere near the back of
his head. Teammates noticed, and Barfield showed the cards to
others as Hunter hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the best batting practice I've ever taken since I've
been in the big leagues,'' Hunter said.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter developed bad habits, he said, because the Astros and
Detroit Tigers wanted him to slap the ball as traditional leadoff
men do. His speed made that approach work, to some extent, because
he could leg out ground-ball hits. But his natural technique,
Hunter said, will produce more line drives and balls hit into the
gaps.
</P>
<P>
   Though he's an aggressive hitter who rarely walks, Hunter said
he also should walk more often. Up to now, he said, he has thought
so much about mechanics that he couldn't concentrate on pitchers'
release points, often picking up pitches just a few feet from the
plate. Now, he thinks he can be more selective.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was fighting my brain trying to do it the way I wasn't used
to doing it, and hitting is so mental,'' Hunter said. ``(My way)
looks crazy, and it may be one of the worst swings in baseball, at
the start. But it's second nature to me. It may not happen right
away, but in the long run, it's going to be better.''
</P>
<P>
   HENRY NEARING RETURN: Left-hander Butch Henry threw 41 pitches
of batting practice yesterday, using all his pitches and throwing
at full exertion. It was the most he's thrown since having surgery
to repair a torn labrum in May, and pitching coach Stan Williams
told trainer Rick Griffin that Henry passed the test.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stan said, after what he saw today, he thought (Henry) was
very close to being ready to pitch,'' Griffin said. ``Tomorrow, if
he feels good _ and I don't think there will be any problems _ he
should be ready to start doing some rehab work.''
</P>
<P>
   The return of Henry would be especially welcome to the Mariners,
whose rotation includes three rookies who have never pitched deep
into September. Manager Lou Piniella already has been using off
days to give those starters _ Freddy Garcia, John Halama and Gil
Meche _ extra rest.
</P>
<P>
   AROUND THE HORN: Mariners hitters were greeted by a new
center-field backdrop when they returned home yesterday. The team
used a bolder green this time, with a different paint base designed
to reduce glare during day games. ... Shortstop Alex Rodriguez
entered Friday night's game with 87 runs batted in and 88 runs
scored in 87 games played. The last player to average a run and an
RBI per game was Joe DiMaggio in 1937. ... According to a
preliminary American League schedule, the Mariners will be the
visiting team when the Detroit Tigers open Comerica Park next April
11. ... Former M's second baseman Harold Reynolds took part in
pregame drills with the team yesterday. Reynolds, an ESPN analyst,
was in Oregon on Thursday with Ken Griffey Jr., who had a building
named after him on the Nike campus. A Nike representative said only
nine or 10 athletes have been so honored. ... The Mariners played a
highlight video and set off fireworks before the game to
congratulate Piniella on his 1,000th win as a manager. Others
trying to offer congratulations had no luck. ``My phone's been out
of order since I've been here,'' Piniella said.

MURDER SUSPECT WINS DELAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY LISA VAN PROYEN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- A 24-year-old parolee accused of murdering a
Woodland Hills telemarketer in February appeared in court as police
awaited DNA tests that might tie two other men to the crime.
</P>
<P>
   Kirell Francis Taylor, also known as Kirell Francis Bettis and
Taylorbettis, asked to delay arraignment until Aug. 27 so he could
meet with his public defender. The request was granted.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor is charged with robbing, abducting and murdering
Christopher Rawlings, a 30-year-old former football star at Crespi
High School in Encino who was under federal investigation for his
telemarketing business.
</P>
<P>
   Because the killing was committed during a robbery, Taylor could
face the death penalty if convicted. Taylor also is charged with
robbery, carjacking, burglary and kidnapping. He is being held
without bail.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators linked Taylor to the killing through eyewitnesses,
DNA evidence and a gold bracelet and gold earring that was found at
Taylor's home in Pacoima but belong to Rawlings' wife, detectives
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a very strong case,'' said Los Angeles County Deputy
District Attorney Shellie Samuels.
</P>
<P>
   Detectives said Taylor and two accomplices singled out Rawlings
because of his white Bentley, followed him home, beat him and
stuffed him in the trunk of his car. After his wife called 911, the
robbers led officers on a wild chase that ended when the Bentley
crashed, critically injuring Rawlings.
</P>
<P>
   Two others remain at large.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, detectives said they are waiting for DNA results on
two of Taylor's ``close associates,'' including an Inglewood man
under arrest on suspicion of robbing a used-car sales lot March 12
in Hawthorne.
</P>
<P>
   The other, a Pacoima man, has been jailed for a week on a parole
violation for his alleged involvement in the same robbery.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor's wallet, identification and boots were found in the car
used in that Hawthorne robbery, said Los Angeles police Detective
Rick Swanston of the West Valley Division.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Taylor worked with three or four ``very organized''
robbers who have hit throughout Southern California, including a
home-invasion robbery in Encino in December.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wear ski masks and gloves and carry walkie-talkies and
police scanners,'' Swanston said.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said Rawlings, a co-owner of a Woodland Hills
clothing store, appears to be a ``random'' victim of a robbery,
rather than a victim of a business deal gone awry.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was driving an expensive car, wearing an expensive watch
and carrying a lot of cash,'' Samuels said. ``He was sort of a
robbery victim waiting to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors also do not believe Rawlings knew Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's absolutely no reason to believe they knew each other
at all,'' said Los Angeles County Deputy District Attorney Larry
Diamond, who filed the case. ``It seems they just picked him out
that night.''
</P>
<P>
   However, detectives said Rawlings knew many people _ any of whom
could have tipped off Taylor that he kept cash and flashy jewelry
at his home.
</P>
<P>
   The six months that led up to Taylor's arrest involved complex
detective work, Swanston said. Police received about 100 tips,
including that the killer is named ``Kirell.''
</P>
<P>
   Detectives searched records for weeks until they found a Kirell
Taylor was an ex-con on parole for robbery, said Detective Andy
Purdy. If the name had not been so unusual, the crime may have
never been solved, Swanston said.
</P>
<P>
   Detectives took a blood sample from Taylor and matched it to
blood from the Bentley, Swanston said.
</P>
<P>
   Rawlings' family expressed relief after Taylor's arrest, a
detective said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are very, very happy,'' Purdy said.

GET OUT YOUR HISTORY BOOKS, GRANDMA _ IT'S TIME TO VOTE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Lou Gehrig was a lock, then came the tough part. What
other first baseman would I vote for on the Major League Baseball
All Century Team?
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Murray, Jimmie Foxx, Harmon Killebrew or Mark McGwire?
</P>
<P>
   Having grown up a Mets fan, the fact that Keith Hernandez was
not one of the choices threw me for a small loop. But I soon got
over it.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, my instincts were to pick Murray along with
Gehrig, mostly because Murray would satisfy my conscience that not
everything about baseball, especially first base, is about the home
run.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the Zen and all the nuances that make baseball the
perfect game, it sure seems as if baseball has transmuted into the
glorification of the home run. And while no other position is as
stockpiled with sluggers as first base, to my way of thinking, at
least Gehrig (two-time Triple Crown winner) and Murray (504 homers
and 3,255 hits) had more than just pure power.
</P>
<P>
   The initial (and, in the end, ludicrous) argument against
McGwire was that despite the captivating way in which he conducted
his 1998 assault on Roger Maris' home run record, there isn't any
other All Century ballot entry worthy of selection based solely on
a single-season record.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, if baseball was just about being Bluto and smashing
balls to the stratosphere, why isn't Boog Powell on the ballot?
</P>
<P>
   Finally, though, after many attempts at rationalizing the
switch-hitting, versatile Murray, whose reputation of surliness has
some merit, it was impossible to pick against McGwire, who went
from 400 homers in '98 to the 500 plateau in '99 _ a feat
remarkable no matter what supplements he is or is not taking.
</P>
<P>
   One position down. Eight to go. See how easy it is to get sucked
in?
</P>
<P>
   We are obsessed with lists. File, rank, serial number and how
great thou art.
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, our sporting society's fondness for lists of the
all-time greatest anything is out of hand.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't long ago that my brother, the walking encyclopedia of
sports, started going apoplectic every time a new issue of Sports
Illustrated hit the doorstep.
</P>
<P>
   The Best this. The Greatest that. Linebackers to die for.
Cricket players to look out for. Twenty hockey guys you'd want on
your power play.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine finally got so desperate for a new category, it
actually had a piece about the top five Pac-10 point guards.
</P>
<P>
   Snooze, you loose. And I started snoozing.
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, when the official ballot for the Major League
Baseball All Century Team wound up in my mailbox two weeks ago, I
paid no attention. Whatever, I decided.
</P>
<P>
   After seeing the 50 greatest NBA players lined up on the court
during halftime of the 1996 All-Star Game, I figured there was no
way any other league could do better.
</P>
<P>
   Something happened, though. While watching the Mariners on TV,
the camera panned to a group of young girls looking over the All
Century ballot. It was then that announcers Dave Valle and Rick
Rizzs joked that they doubted the ability of those kids to make a
wise selection.
</P>
<P>
   That's when I pulled out my ballot, just to see how tough
picking this All Century team would be.
</P>
<P>
   I found the choosing to be a lot more fun than expected _ if you
consider a night in bed with ``Total Baseball,'' major league
baseball's all-inclusive encyclopedia, fun. Here are the rest of my
picks:
</P>
<P>
   Second base: It, too, was a snap, mostly because Wally Backman
wasn't included. (Any other '86 Mets fans out there?)
</P>
<P>
   Rogers Hornsby and Jackie Robinson. Hornsby got my vote for the
sheer offensive numbers (his .358 career batting average is second
only to Ty Cobb, and three times he hit over .400) and Robinson for
his numbers and for his strength and fortitude in breaking
baseball's race barrier.
</P>
<P>
   Third base did not stump me, either.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Schmidt, despite his strikeouts, was the best-hitting third
baseman and he won eight Gold Gloves, three MVPs, four RBI titles
and eight home run crowns.
</P>
<P>
   Now the tougher part: George Brett (three batting titles in
three decades) or Brooks Robinson (16 consecutive Gold Gloves)?
</P>
<P>
   After some struggle, I took the poised, powerful Robinson,
although his career .267 batting average paled next to Brett's .305
mark.
</P>
<P>
   Now it gets tougher.
</P>
<P>
   Shortstop: Honus Wagner, Cal Ripken Jr. and Ozzie Smith were the
contenders out of the list that includes Ernie Banks, Luis
Aparicio, Luke Appling, Robin Yount and Joe Cronin.
</P>
<P>
   Wagner (.327 average, 3,415 hits, 1,732 RBIs and 722 stolen
bases) is a lock. In Total Baseball, his biographical sketch
includes anecdotes about how Wagner knocked Ty Cobb's teeth loose
in a tag out in the 1909 World Series and how Wagner was so
bow-legged and long-armed, he could tie his shoes without bending
down.
</P>
<P>
   The second pick is where it gets tricky. Smith was the best
defensive shortstop, and the Wizard endeavored to make himself a
more-than-respectable offensive presence.
</P>
<P>
   But how can you avoid picking Ripken, whose iron will made him
baseball's Iron Man? Ripken's career also has spanned Rookie of the
Year, two MVPs and his imprint as the guy who started a new era of
power-hitting shortstops.
</P>
<P>
   Catcher: Yogi Berra is easy. His work behind and at the plate
for the New York Yankees puts him on top of the list.
</P>
<P>
   But what about picking between Johnny Bench, Roy Campanella,
Carlton Fisk and Josh Gibson?
</P>
<P>
   Fisk should be pleased to get a mention and Gibson, the Negro
League star, is woefully unknown.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a catcher that any big league club would like to buy
for $200,000. His name is Gibson. He can do anything,'' said
pitching great Walter Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can hit the ball a mile, catches the ball so easily, it
looks like he's in a rocking chair, throws like a bullet. Bill
Dickey isn't as good a catcher. Too bad this Gibson fella is a
colored fella.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Campy's Dodgers so epically battled Berra's Yanks, we'll
take Campanella.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the outfield. You get to pick nine.
</P>
<P>
   The first three are easy: Babe Ruth, Ted Williams and Hank
Aaron.
</P>
<P>
   Second three are almost as easy: Willie Mays, Joe DiMaggio and
Ty Cobb.
</P>
<P>
   The third three picks are miserably hard, but here goes:
</P>
<P>
   Pete Rose (Charlie Hustle's got the numbers, baby); Ken Griffey
Jr. (Already a Hall of Famer, he's going to break a few records
before his induction ceremony); and Roberto Clemente (his last hit
was his 3,000th and he was the first Latin player elected to the
Hall).
</P>
<P>
   Now, for something Mariner fans know little about _ great
pitching. You get to pick six pitchers and at least one of them
must be a lefty. How 'bout: Walter Johnson, Cy Young, Warren Spahn
(L), Sandy Koufax (L), Nolan Ryan and Tom Seaver ('69 Mets).
</P>
<P>
   Now there's a rotation, Mariner fans.

GAME GOES ON, AND SPARKS WIN

<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ There was a strange mix of emotions in the
Forum on Friday night as the Sparks and the Houston Comets played
with heavy hearts in a game Los Angeles needed to win.
</P>
<P>
   With two-time Most Valuable Player Cynthia Cooper sitting out
for Houston, Penny Toler made four late free throws in the final
minute to clinch a 68-64 victory before a season-high crowd of
13,116.
</P>
<P>
   Considering the circumstances, the game seemed almost secondary.
</P>
<P>
   The death of Kim Perrot shook the Houston organization and the
entire WNBA family hard.
</P>
<P>
   Described as the heart, soul and energy of the Comets, the
spirited point guard lost her battle to cancer Thursday. She was
32.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, Houston (25-6), which had already clinched the
Western Conference title to earn a first-round bye, discussed
forfeiting the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought that was something we could do,'' Houston coach Van
Chancellor said. ``But (Kim's) sister did not think that was
something Kim would want us to do, nor did the family want us to.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks (20-11), who conclude their season at Utah today,
will host the Sacramento Monarchs in a single-elimination game
Tuesday. Houston will play the winner Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Except for Cooper, who was at Perrot's bedside with family
members when her best friend died, the Comets were in Los Angeles
when they found out their teammate was gone.
</P>
<P>
   The news hit Cooper particularly hard. She and the diminutive
guard bonded after Perrot was voted onto the team after a Comets
tryout before the inaugural season. Cooper also lost her mother to
a long bout with cancer on Feb.12, just nine days before Perrot's
diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
   Perrot died six months after being diagnosed with lung cancer
that had spread to her brain. She had surgery to remove tumors in
February. ``She was a personal friend,'' Chancellor said. ``She was
my domino-playing buddy. We were good friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Perrot touched many lives during the time she led the Comets to
two WNBA championships.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now the team is just thinking about Kim individually in
our own minds,'' said Tammy Jackson, who spoke on behalf the team
before the game. ``If we think too much it will be too hard. We're
using basketball as an outlet.''
</P>
<P>
   As a gesture of compassion, the Sparks gave spiritual bracelets
to each Houston player and embraced them in an emotional display of
support before the game. All the players wore black bands on their
jerseys.
</P>
<P>
   Perrot was in Tijuana, Mexico, receiving alternative treatment
for the cancer before her condition worsened. She returned to
Houston on Saturday and was admitted to the University of Texas
M.D. Anderson Cancer Center last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   At halftime, a video tribute to Perrot was shown and a moment of
silence was observed.
</P>
<P>
   A celebration of Perrot's life will held Monday in Houston. She
will be buried Tuesday in her hometown of Lafayette, La. in a
private service with family and close friends.

FINLEY LIFTS ANGELS
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Behind starting pitcher Chuck Finley, the
Anaheim Angels beat the Detroit Tigers 5-1 before 29,910 at Edison
Field on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Finley, who is 3-0 with a 1.19 ERA in four starts since the
trading deadline, gave up one run and five hits while throwing his
first complete game of the season.
</P>
<P>
   But before the Angels and Tigers _ two last-place teams _ got
together on the field to play a game that meant very little, one
Angels player sat in the clubhouse and pondered his future.
</P>
<P>
   Pitcher Ken Hill is on the disabled list and probably won't
pitch again until September. He's eligible to come off the DL Aug.
30.
</P>
<P>
   But Hill, who was placed on the DL Aug. 15 with a strained right
groin and tendinitis in his left knee, says he could pitch today if
asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm ready to pitch, I'm ready to pitch right now,'' Hill said.
``I didn't want to go on the DL. I'm fine.''
</P>
<P>
   So why is he on the disabled list?
</P>
<P>
   The Angels need to take a look at some of their pitching
prospects. Manager Terry Collins said Jarrod Washburn and Ramon
Ortiz _ ``and there may be others'' _ will be in the rotation
through the end of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Hill, though, believes there might be more to it. Hill will make
a guaranteed $5.6 million next season, and he has a vested option
for 2001.
</P>
<P>
   If Hill makes a combined 55 starts in 1999 and 2000, he is
guaranteed $6 million for 2001. He also could guarantee 2001 by
pitching 190 innings next season, or 385 innings combined in '99
and 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Hill has made 22 starts this season and pitched 1232/3 innings.
The less Hill pitches, the better the Angels' chances of saving $6
million on a pitcher who has a history of elbow trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``They do what they want to do,'' said Hill, who also spent time
on the DL this year with an inflamed elbow. ``I'm not worried about
it. I have plenty of money.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they don't want me here, trade me. I'll go to another team.
It's no big deal.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels probably would love to trade Hill, but it's difficult
to trade a pitcher, with an arthritic elbow, making better than $5
million a year.
</P>
<P>
   Hill, though, can't help but wonder where he fits in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chuck's probably going to sign here next year,'' Hill said.
``And (Tim) Belcher's going to be here next year. (Steve) Sparks, I
don't know his situation. We don't even know if we're going to have
a GM and a manager. There's so much talk and speculation. We might
even have a new owner. You never know what's going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Hill is 4-11 this season, but his ERA of 4.80 is better than the
American League average of 4.95. He has pitched well since his
first stint on the DL, but admits his right elbow will never be
what it was before he injured it and had surgery last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's never going to be healthy, they know that,'' Hill said.
``If they find something to cure arthritis, I'll be healthy. Other
than that, it's something I have to deal with.''
</P>
<P>
   Finley, at 36, has no such problems. He has pitched into the
seventh inning in six consecutive starts. The complete game was his
first since April 17, 1998 and was the Angels' fourth of the
season. Omar Olivares, since traded to Oakland, has the other
three.
</P>
<P>
   Finley (8-10) admitted his recent success might have something
to do with getting beyond the trade speculation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the first time I ever went through something like
that,'' he said. ``If it ever happens again, I'll know how to
handle it better. When I got past it, it freed my mind up.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though the season is lost for the team, Finley said he
feels he has something to prove.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to pitch well and finish strong,'' he said. ``And
show the organization and my players I'm a lot better pitcher than
what I was showing.''
</P>
<P>
   Finley got support from an offense that made the most of its
seven hits. The Angels had three sacrifice flies, the most they've
had in a game this season. Second baseman Trent Durrington was the
only Angels with more than one hit, going 2 for 3.

LATE BURST OFF M'S OFFENSE NOT ENOUGH TO CATCH CLEVELAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Two weeks ago, with optimism high and a pennant race
in sight, the Mariners faced an elite team in a four-game series at
Safeco Field. The New York Yankees won the opener, 7-4, and swept
the series.
</P>
<P>
   The M's have been recovering ever since. When the equally
menacing Cleveland Indians came to town Friday night, Seattle had
an even record and a second chance.
</P>
<P>
   It could not have been a good omen that Cleveland won the opener
by that same 7-4 score.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to come up to their level of play,'' said shortstop
Alex Rodriguez, who batted as the tying run in the ninth inning and
struck out to end the game. ``They've got great defense, good
offense, good pitching. Everyone has to excel and bring their game
up to that level. Personally, I had opportunities to do damage, and
I didn't get it done. No excuses.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners put runners at first and second with one out
against Indians closer Mike Jackson, a two-time M's castoff.
Jackson struck out Ken Griffey Jr., then got Rodriguez to chase a
slider, sending 44,915 fans home.
</P>
<P>
   The pessimists among them could have left four innings earlier.
The Indians, who share the AL's best record, built a 5-0 lead
through five off starter John Halama.
</P>
<P>
   At the All-Star break, Halama was in the midst of a nine-game
winning streak, which tied a single-season club record, and had a
2.89 earned-run average and just three home runs allowed. In seven
starts since, his ERA is 7.23 and he has surrendered seven homers.
His loss Friday was his third in a row.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't seem to me like he's changing speeds as well as
early in the year,'' said manager Lou Piniella. ``But I'm going to
look at the film.''
</P>
<P>
   Piniella, who looks at film occasionally but not often, said
Halama has not been as sharp his last few outings. Halama had no
plans to study the outing, but said he hasn't changed anything from
early in the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been doing the same things,'' Halama said. ``I'm not
fatigued. I'm just going through a rut right now. It's just one of
those things pitchers go through.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday night, he hit Manny Ramirez to lead off the second and
gave up a two-run homer to Richie Sexson on the next pitch. Halama,
a control specialist, then loaded the bases on two walks and a
single. He got out of the inning with a grounder, but Roberto
Alomar led off the third with a homer to put Cleveland ahead, 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   Halama was trying to induce a double-play ball from Sexson, but
left his fastball up and over the plate _ dangerous territory for a
pitcher without an overpowering fastball.
</P>
<P>
   In the fifth, Dave Roberts led off with a bunt single, and
Halama _ who has no pickoffs despite a move that one Yankee
recently called the best in the league _ caught him leading off
first. Roberts sped toward second, but Ryan Jackson's wild throw
turned a would-be pick-off into a dire situation: runner on third,
no outs.
</P>
<P>
   A double by Omar Vizquel scored Roberts, and two sacrifices
scored Vizquel to give the Indians a 5-0 lead. But Halama (9-5) had
re-gained his command, and he worked 1-2-3 innings in the sixth and
seventh.
</P>
<P>
   That kept the Mariners close, and they rallied for four runs
when Indians starter Bartolo Colon left in the sixth inning. Colon,
5-1 since the All-Star break, allowed just two singles and a walk,
striking out six, in five innings. But after a one-out walk to
David Bell, Colon was removed because of tightness in his left
knee. Rookie David Riske, a native of Kent, was summoned, and four
consecutive hits brought in the four runs.
</P>
<P>
   A bases-loaded double by Edgar Martinez _ who had three hits and
is batting .403 in August _ scored two. Jay Buhner followed with an
infield single when first baseman Jim Thome stabbed a sharp
grounder in the hole but found Riske nowhere near the bag for the
toss. A Ryan Jackson ground out cut Cleveland's lead to 5-4.
</P>
<P>
   In the seventh, Riske was replaced by veteran Paul Shuey, who
allowed a leadoff single to Russ Davis. Davis made it to second on
a sacrifice by Brian Hunter, but Shuey recovered to strike out
David Bell and get Ken Griffey Jr. to bounce to first, ending the
inning.
</P>
<P>
   Shuey left two on in the eighth, striking out Dan Wilson with
runners at first and second to end the inning.

   &UR; INTERNATIONAL &LR;  (Moving in ``i'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   TURKEY-QUAKE (Istanbul, Turkey) _ With victims bemoaning a lack
of government authority to help them recover from Tuesday's
shattering earthquake, the Turkish Army entered the rescue and
cleanup effort Saturday after spending days on the sidelines. By
Stephen Kinzer. (With a map.)
</P>
<P>
   TURKEY-FAMILIES (Golcuk, Turkey) _ It was in the early hours of
Saturday morning when members of Aydin family finally took a break
from digging out corpses of their relatives. Golcuk, pulverized by
Turkey's huge earthquake on Tuesday, seemed a scene from hell. Its
buildings are in rubble; most of its residents evacuated _ or dead;
its air increasingly unbreathable from decaying flesh. By Edmund L.
Andrews.
</P>
<P>
   GERMANY-REUNIFY (Berlin) _ The tale of Wally Mueller and
Waltraut Neumann is a normal German story _ one of loss, division
and elusive reconciliation _ a tale of two women tossed this way
and that by the traumas of their city and their country. By Roger
Cohen. (With a map.)
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-POLITICS (Moscow) _ If ever there was an example of how
hard it is for Russia's liberal politicians to work together it was
Saturday when Sergei Stepashin's new centerist electoral bloc
collapsed. By Michael R. Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   NY-BANK-RUSSIA-MOB _ At the intersection of illicit Russian
money and the Bank of New York is Bruce Rappaport, a Swiss banker
with a shadowy past who has long had an important connection to the
bank.
</P>
<P>
   SIERRA-LEONE (Freetown, Sierra Leone) _ After the rebels had
fled into the surrounding hills, Lamine Jusu Jarka was carried to
the main hospital here one morning last January. A young man named
Mr. Junior, wearing a shirt that declared ``C.O. Cut Hands,'' had
chopped off his arms with an ax. Half a year later, as a fragile
peace agreement has stayed the fighting in one of Africa's cruelest
wars, Jarka is still alive _ a living symbol of the terror of that
dark time. By Norimitsu Onishi. (With a map.)
</P>
<P>
   MEXICO-ELECTION-PANEL (Mexico City) _ If there is one reason
Mexico expects to break with decades-old tradition and have a clean
and fair presidential election next year, it is that an elections
council will oversee the vote. By Julia Preston.
</P>
<P>
   INDIA-NUKE-POLICY (New Delhi, India) _ For the past week, many
of India's political elite have been thinking about that most
chilling of subjects: the hows and whys of building a nuclear
arsenal. The cause for this reflection was a six-page document
titled ``Indian Nuclear Doctrine.'' By Barry Bearak.
</P>
<P>
   INDIA-PHILANTHROPIST _ Dominique Lapierre has ranged over
several continents in his best-selling books on modern history, but
only one place has never let go of him. More than two decades ago,
after the publication of ``Freedom at Midnight,'' the story of
Indian independence, Mr. Lapierre went back to India to try to
share his success with the people who had inspired his work. ``It
was the beginning of an adventure that never stopped,'' he said in
an interview during a recent stopover in New York. He was on his
way home to France with his wife, also named Dominique, after
talking to business executives in Aspen, Colo., about the private
aid projects the couple finance. By Barbara Crossette.

<P>
   &UR; NATIONAL &LR;  (Moving in ``a'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   HP-GLASS-CEILING (Palo Alto, Calif.) _ Hewlett-Packard's
elevation of Carly Fiorina to the post of chief executive last
month solidified the company's reputation as a bastion of
egalitarianism in a male-dominated corporate world. With more than
a quarter of Hewlett-Packard's managers women _ including one who
was a main rival of Ms. Fiorina for the top job _ it seemed
incontestable that the glass ceiling that stops the rise of female
executives at so many other companies had been shattered. But what
enlightened soul shattered it? The surprising answer: a middle-aged
white guy who never thought much about women in the workplace _
until he was thrust suddenly into the uncomfortable role of single
parent. By Reed Abelson. (With a photo.)
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-VACATION (Edgartown, Mass.) _ A year ago, President
Clinton made a faltering speech about forgiveness and attracted
widespread media attention. Now, the language of forgive and forget
rolls off his tongue in a manner that no longer surprises and,
perhaps more importantly, no longer carries the freighted question
of whether he will be forgiven. Clinton and his wife, Hillary
Rodham Clinton, are back on Martha's Vineyard for their fifth
summer vacation. By Katharine Q. Seelye.
</P>
<P>
   SILICON-VALLEY-TRAFFIC (San Francisco) _ For many professionals
at dot-com companies in Silicon Valley, the boom in the Internet
has resulted in a commuting bust, forcing them to funnel onto
increasingly congested highways that snake in and around the
crowded Bay Area. From San Francisco to San Jose, the expanding
economy has created a traffic jam of unprecedented proportions. By
Laura M. Holson. (With a photo and a map.)
</P>
<P>
   URBAN-ARMY-SCHOOL (Ft. Knox, Ky.) _ The Army has spent millions
to build a 26 acre mock city, full of high-tech simulation borrowed
from amusement parks, for training armored forces in urban combat.
But like a Hollywood set from a movie that was never shot, the site
is unused because the armor school has not decided where it fits
into the curriculum. By Steven A. Holmes.
</P>
<P>
   YEAR-2000-DOOMSAYER _ For months, government officials have
worried that zealous pessimists about the world's preparations for
Year 2000 computer problems could stir panic. Thanks to a prominent
doomsayer named Jim Lord, they have a fresh example of what they
fear. By Barnaby J. Feder.
</P>
<P>
   WORLD-CHESS-MATCH _ The gathering of attention among chess
devotees that accompanies the start of any world championship
match, either at the site of play or at computer terminals around
the world, was under way in earnest Saturday as the title match of
the International Chess Federation went through final preparations
for its opening Sunday evening at Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas. By
Robert Byrne.
</P>
<P>
   YELLOWSTONE-LAND-DEAL (Washington) _ The federal government and
a new age church have completed a deal that protects bison and
geysers in Yellowstone National Park, President Clinton announced
Saturday in his weekly radio address. By Matthew L. Wald.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; POLITICS &LR;  (Moving in ``p'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   BUSH-MEDIA-POLITICS _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush's refusal to
give a ``yes'' or ``no'' answer when asked if he had used cocaine
had been old news since his first campaign for governor of Texas in
1994. Then, he rebuffed the question with the words: ``What I did
as a kid? I don't think it's relevant.'' There the question and
answer stood, basically unchanged, as the Governor rose to national
political prominence. But in the last three weeks, the alchemy of
repetition made the old question new news in some news outlets. By

   BBN-CHASS-COLUMN (Undated) _ The National League is faced with a
mathematical impossibility: Four into three won't go. The Mets,
Braves, Astros and Reds are competing for three playoff spots. One
of them won't make it, even though they all could have better
records than the Arizona Diamondbacks, the presumptive winner of
the NL West. By Murray Chass.

<P>
   LIPSYTE-COLUMN (Undated) _ Those archangels of the arena,
Michael, John, Wayne and Steffi, flew away this year, and I hardly
thought about them. All four were driven, hard-working
perfectionists who gave us our money's worth. Yet none of them
quite grabbed at our hearts or elbowed our ribs. They worked so
hard, they didn't seem to be having fun. By Robert Lipsyte.
</P>
<P>
   BBO-DROPOUT (New York) _ Four years ago, George Carrion was one
of the best high school baseball prospects to come out of New York
in 20 years. After one season at a Texas junior college, the Texas
Rangers signed him to a contract with a $700,000 bonus to play in
their minor-league system. Yet last summer, Carrion abruptly quit.
He drove home to Yonkers and has been, in his words, ``just hanging
out with buddies.'' Carrion sleeps till noon most days, goes to
nightclubs on weekends and plays rec-league softball for a
half-dozen teams around the Bronx. His mother, Margie Carrion, said
recently, ``Not a day goes by when I don't want to strangle that
kid.'' By Alan Schwarz.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ With victims bemoaning a lack of government
authority to help them recover from Tuesday's shattering
earthquake, the Turkish army entered the rescue and cleanup effort
Saturday after spending days on the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews in devastated towns, many survivors asked,
``Devlet nerede?'' _ ``Where is the state?'' And on Saturday
political leaders sought to calm public anger over the often
chaotic rescue effort, as the death toll from the disaster passed
10,000, and was steadily rising.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, anyone suffering from this disaster asks where the
state is,'' President Suleyman Demirel said Saturday. But he said
people should not expect the government to ``work miracles.''
</P>
<P>
   Soldiers were sent to several devastated towns to pick up
garbage, which has been rotting in the hot sun and could be a
source of disease. The military chief of staff, Gen. Huseyin
Kivrikoglu, said he had met with Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit, but
gave no details of their talks.
</P>
<P>
   After the meeting, television stations reported that the
governors of three provinces in the earthquake zone were about to
be dismissed for their failure to organize effective relief
efforts. A deputy prime minister was assigned to try to put out the
blaze that has consumed the country's largest oil refinery, which
was still smoldering as foreign pilots complained that the aerial
fire-fighting operation had been poorly organized.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government decided that it could handle the quake by
giving further authority to itself and to governors,'' Kivrikoglu
said. He rejected accusations that the military had been late in
mobilizing to help victims, and told journalists, ``Don't
demoralize the soldiers.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Turks were astonished by the absence of soldiers in the
early relief efforts. The Turkish army portrays itself as a
quintessentially national institution that is always ready to step
in when the nation is in danger. But for several days after the
earthquake, it maintained a remarkably low profile, leaving the
rescue effort to civilian agencies and foreign volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for the general staff did not respond to requests for
an explanation of the army's position. One newspaper quoted an
unnamed government official as saying that civilian leaders ``had
coordination and communication problems with the military for 48
hours, which were resolved on Thursday.'' Another said the military
``suffered huge logistical problems on the first day after the
quake,'' but had since overcome them.
</P>
<P>
   An official close to the military said commanders feared that
thrusting themselves into the spotlight would give the impression
that they were running Turkey. The commanders have played a
decisive role in domestic politics over the last few years, and are
sensitive to assertions that they are intruding into spheres where
they do not belong.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a feeling that the military shouldn't just go in and
start giving orders,'' said the official. ``Civilian institutions
have to be allowed to do their jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   According to published reports, senior Turkish officials have
reprimanded the state-owned TRT television network for broadcasting
footage suggesting that government negligence was responsible for
chaos in the rescue effort.
</P>
<P>
   One of the officials coordinating the effort, Minister of State
Sukru Gurel, pledged to review complaints against contractors who
built homes that did not withstand Tuesday's quake.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will try to do our best, both in investigating and trying
to overcome this structural problem in the future,'' Gurel said.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the Turkish Contractors Association, Kadir
Sever, issued a statement asking people not to blame all
contractors for shoddy construction practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is that it is too easy to be a contractor in
Turkey,'' Sever said. ``There are 40,000 contractors doing business
in Turkey, and most of them are unqualified.''
</P>
<P>
   There were several minor tremors in the earthquake zone on
Friday and Saturday, and thousands of people slept outdoors in fear
of more serious aftershocks. Most seismologists, though, say there
is little danger of another major quake soon.
</P>
<P>
   Now that so much time has passed since Tuesday's disaster, the
recovery of each survivor represents a near-miracle. At midday
Saturday an Austrian team pulled a 95-year-old woman from the
wreckage of a vacation complex in the seaside town of Yalova. She
told her rescuers that she thought others were still alive beneath
the same pile of debris.
</P>
<P>
   Many roads in the affected area were jammed for days by
well-meaning Turks who were trying to bring aid to victims, but
whose presence made it difficult for ambulances and rescue teams to
move. As the huge traffic jams began to ease, senior officials from
several countries toured the area. Among them were the Belgian and
Japanese foreign ministers, the chief medical officer of the
Israeli army and U.S. Ambassador Mark Parris.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one who visits here can help but be shocked by the level of
devastation,'' Parris said. He pledged that the United States would
``do everything in its power to help Turkey deal with the tragic
consequences of the earthquake.''
</P>
<P>
   American participation in the relief effort is expected to surge
in the coming days. Three warships carrying more than 3,000 sailors
and Marines, and equipped with operating rooms and other medical
installations to tend to the more than 30,000 people estimated to
be injured, are scheduled to arrive in Turkish waters during the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to assign soldiers to collect refuse was one of
several steps taken to help prevent the outbreak of an epidemic.
Medical teams have begun spraying disinfectants, immunizing rescue
workers against typhoid and distributing chlorine tablets for water
purification. Recovered bodies are being quickly photographed for
future identification and then buried. In the devastated town of
Adapazari, 963 bodies were interred in a mass grave.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many people, plus animals and food, under the
debris,'' said Rifat Kose, an official at the health ministry. ``An
epidemic could occur as they decay, but we are taking necessary
measures.''
</P>
<P>
   With dozens of countries now actively involved in the aid effort
here, the president of neighboring Iraq, Saddam Hussein, declared
that he was determined to provide more help than the United States.
According to news reports from Baghdad, Saddam is ready to offer
large amounts of crude oil that could be traded for relief supplies
or sold to raise money for reconstruction.

THE STORY OF A FRIENDSHIP AND OF THE FATE OF BERLIN

<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ This is a normal German story _ one of loss, division
and elusive reconciliation _ a tale of two women tossed this way
and that by the traumas of their city and their country.
</P>
<P>
   When Wally Mueller and Waltraut Neumann met at the end of World
War II, close to 90 percent of Berlin's 1.5 million apartments had
been damaged by Allied bombing. Aged 18, penniless, they went to
work as ``Truemmerfrauen'' _ two of the thousands of ``rubble
women'' whose job it was to clear up the mess.
</P>
<P>
   Sifting good bricks from bad, working with their bare hands,
paid first with food stamps and only later in cash, they toiled for
several years. When they look today at the hill in Friedrichshain
park, where children sled in winter, what they see is the great
mound of bombed-out masonry that lies underneath.
</P>
<P>
   That is Berlin today _ layer upon hidden layer of damage, of
pain _ an archeological dig of Europe in this century.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is hard to believe now that everything was kaput in 1945,''
Mrs. Mueller, now 72, said. ``But it was kaput. Finished. And when
I see the people wandering around the city today, I wonder if they
understand that.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those people, as of Monday, will be Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder and his government, who arrive at last from Bonn, a town
chosen as the postwar capital because it was, in Konrad Adenauer's
words, ``a city without a past.'' What will confront Schroeder here
is, in essence, Germany's past divisions.
</P>
<P>
   That history is present in the lives of Mrs. Mueller and Mrs.
Neumann, who found themselves on opposite sides of the Berlin wall
when it went up in 1961, just as it is alive in the hearts of many
of this city's 3.5 million people. In Berlin, unlike Bonn, the
difficulty of making Germany whole is palpable.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now see it will take another generation or two to bring
Germany together,'' said Barbel Dieckmann, the mayor of Bonn. ``Our
mistake was to underestimate the thousand differences in mentality
and to talk of flowering fields in the East instead of how
difficult it would be to achieve that.''
</P>
<P>
   The errors of the past will provide scant consolation to
Schroeder, who knows that the East-West acrimony, rooted in high
unemployment, slow economic growth and a cultural divide, is
certain to sap his popularity, already at a low ebb. The
frustrations of the two ``rubble women'' suggest that his
conciliatory task in Berlin will not be easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can still hear that Soviet propaganda coming over the wall _
the so-called voice of truth and reason,'' said Mrs. Neumann, who
was on the Western side. ``When I think of my friend stuck in the
East, subjected to that for all those years, it is a wonder we
still communicate.''
</P>
<P>
   But the communication between the two women is often difficult _
just as German unification, now almost a decade old, has proved
extremely arduous _ despite the strange symmetry to their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Both Mrs. Mueller and Mrs. Neumann were born in 1927, and both
married in 1952. Godparents to each other's children, they have
always felt a bond. But there is symmetry, too, in their scars and
intermittent anger.
</P>
<P>
   The war was hard on Mrs. Neumann. Her only brother, Karl-Heinz
Schmidt, aged 18, was sent to the eastern front in 1941. Within a
day he was dead, his demise announced in a letter saying that he
had fallen ``for Volk and Vaterland''.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember my father throwing the letter on the floor and
saying he had one son and had not raised him to die for Volk and
Vaterland,'' Mrs. Neumann said. ``The next day, another letter
arrived announcing his arrival at the front. He must have been
killed within hours, and the death notice reached us before the
arrival notice.''
</P>
<P>
   The man she would marry, Willi Neumann, was also deeply marked
by the war. He joined the German army in 1942 _ ``I was not a party
member, but I was not against Hitler,'' he said _ and ended the war
in Holland, where he was captured by the Americans as he tried to
flee on a horse-drawn cart.
</P>
<P>
   Several years in Allied prisoner-of-war camps followed, first
under the Americans, then the British, finally the French, who took
Neumann to northern France and put him to work in the mines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those were not nice times,'' he said. ``But then these are not
nice times either.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Neumanns, as for the Muellers and many other older
Germans, a lingering feeling of frustration often surfaces, clearly
rooted in the sense that their wartime suffering was real but that
the scale of Nazi Holocaust crimes has made it almost impossible to
talk about their losses and wounds.
</P>
<P>
   When the Neumanns married, they made one decision they would not
regret. They moved from the east of the city to Wedding, a
working-class district, taking an apartment that, nine years later,
would be just a few hundred yards west of the Berlin wall. Neumann
began to work at the AEG electronics factory.
</P>
<P>
   Before the wall went up, Mrs. Neumann begged her friend Mrs.
Mueller to join her in Wedding. It was becoming steadily more
difficult to move between the Russian and Allied sectors; pay was
far better in the western one. But with most of her family in
Leipzig in the east, Mrs. Mueller was reluctant to move.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, we never imagined there could be a wall between
us,'' Mrs. Mueller said. ``For the year before the wall went up, my
husband was traveling to the west every day to work as a
bricklayer. Then, overnight, he could not go to work, and telephone
contact was cut until 1975.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, Ronald Mueller, also bore war scars. Sent to the
Russian front to help build an airfield, he was almost recruited by
the SS, but ultimately rejected because he was not tall enough. So
he eventually went to fight in North Africa, where he was captured
by the British.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was held until 1948,'' Mueller said. ``After the war, the
commander of the camp was a British Jew. He kept telling me _
`You're a Nazi, you're a Nazi, you're a Nazi.' Of course, I
understand his anger, but I was not a Nazi, I was a young German
drafted into the army.''
</P>
<P>
   For 15 years _ from 1961 to 1976 _ the Muellers and Neumanns
were unable to see or speak to each other. Mrs. Mueller had two
children, a boy and a girl, while her friend on the Western side of
the wall had one son. Mrs. Mueller held jobs _ first in a
kindergarten, then as a receptionist _ while Mrs. Neumann raised
her boy.
</P>
<P>
   The Muellers did not become Communists, and the Neumanns were
not lifted to wealth by the postwar economic miracle in the West.
Mueller worked on the East German railroads until 1976; Neumann
labored for 27 years in the AEG factory in the West. But the ideas
of the two families slowly diverged.
</P>
<P>
   As long as the wall was there, and visits rare and emotional,
these differences were masked. But over the past decade, traveling
freely across a Berlin undergoing yet another reinvention, the
effect of long-divided lives has become clearer.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Neumann, whose husband is weak after heart surgery, appears
deeply embittered. She is angry that her husband's pension _ about
$1,300 a month _ is too low. She is angry that her work as a
``rubble woman'' was never formally recognized, so she is not
entitled to a pension for those years.
</P>
<P>
   She is worried that her son, Heimo, a seasonal construction
worker, does not have enough money to pay his mortgage. She is
troubled by all the money the West has had to pour into the East.
And she is angry at the large influx of Turkish immigrants into
Wedding and the rest of Berlin. Over 140,000 Turks live in the
city.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not antiforeigners,'' she said, ``but here there are only
foreigners. You cannot find a German in my local park. That is too
much. I do not want to go to Turkey, so why do they all want to
come here? I might have found a job at the till in a supermarket.
But they prefer Turks to me.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Neumann, who votes for the small ``Gray Panther'' party
representing angry pensioners while her husband votes for the
extreme-right Republikaners, went on to say that she found it
strange that Turkish women with veils were not allowed in the
Turkish parliament, but abounded in Wedding, where their children
were constantly shouting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like telling them that if they do not want to educate
their children, I will,'' she remarked.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   To Mrs. Mueller, who has retained a feisty good cheer, these
complaints are excessive. She spent many years adjusting to the
penury of Communist society, and feels her old friend has been
spoiled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell her to be more positive, but she tells me that we in
the East have had everything since 1989, and the Westerners have
had to pay for it.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   A few years after the wall came down, the two couples decided to
celebrate their reconciliation by going on vacation in Austria. But
the trip was not altogether a success. Mrs. Mueller found Mrs.
Neumann too fussy _ complaining that the bed was too hard, that she
needed a separate room because her husband snored, that the food
was not right.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the East we learned that if there was something you could
not change, you just got on and lived with it,'' Mrs. Mueller said.
``But she complains all the time. I am sorry about these problems,
because we used to get along so well.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   On balance, Mrs. Mueller now feels that she was better off in
the former East Germany _ a view that shocks and troubles her
friend. She could work, her children had jobs, and if there was no
freedom, there was a sort of security.
</P>
<P>
   Now her son, Kurt, a construction worker who had a steady job on
the railroads in the former East Germany, has been out of a job for
a year, one of the more than four million unemployed in Germany.
His quest for a job obsesses his mother, who is angry at his
exclusion from a ``united Germany'' and responds to job
advertisements on his behalf.
</P>
<P>
   But with no luck. Kurt receives about $1,500 a month in
unemployment benefits, a sum scarcely sufficient to support his
companion and their 11-year-old child.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can't afford a wedding, so he does not get married,'' Mrs.
Mueller said of Kurt, before adding with a laugh, ``And if they did
get married, they certainly would not be able to afford a
divorce!''
</P>
<P>
   The two women still meet regularly to play table tennis at a
social club, and they marvel at the construction that has again
made rubble a common sight in Berlin, 54 years after they began
picking the good bricks from the shattered ruins.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been a bad century for this city,'' Mrs. Mueller said.
``But at least we had hoped for better for our children. Despite
everything, I am proud to be a German, but if people do not have
jobs, this country will not heal and move forward as one.''

<P>
   Here are today's top news stories from The New York Times News
Service for AMs of Sunday, Aug. 22:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; INTERNATIONAL &LR;  (Moving in ``i'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   TURKEY-QUAKE (Istanbul, Turkey) _ With victims bemoaning a lack
of government authority to help them recover from Tuesday's
shattering earthquake, the Turkish Army entered the rescue and
cleanup effort Saturday after spending days on the sidelines. By
Stephen Kinzer. (With a map.)
</P>
<P>
   TURKEY-FAMILIES (Golcuk, Turkey) _ It was in the early hours of
Saturday morning when members of Aydin family finally took a break
from digging out corpses of their relatives. Golcuk, pulverized by
Turkey's huge earthquake on Tuesday, seemed a scene from hell. Its
buildings are in rubble; most of its residents evacuated _ or dead;
its air increasingly unbreathable from decaying flesh. By Edmund L.
Andrews.
</P>
<P>
   GERMANY-REUNIFY (Berlin) _ The tale of Wally Mueller and
Waltraut Neumann is a normal German story _ one of loss, division
and elusive reconciliation _ a tale of two women tossed this way
and that by the traumas of their city and their country. By Roger
Cohen. (With a map.)
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-POLITICS (Moscow) _ If ever there was an example of how
hard it is for Russia's liberal politicians to work together it was
Saturday when Sergei Stepashin's new centerist electoral bloc
collapsed. By Michael R. Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   NY-BANK-RUSSIA-MOB _ At the intersection of illicit Russian
money and the Bank of New York is Bruce Rappaport, a Swiss banker
with a shadowy past who has long had an important connection to the
bank.
</P>
<P>
   SIERRA-LEONE (Freetown, Sierra Leone) _ After the rebels had
fled into the surrounding hills, Lamine Jusu Jarka was carried to
the main hospital here one morning last January. A young man named
Mr. Junior, wearing a shirt that declared ``C.O. Cut Hands,'' had
chopped off his arms with an ax. Half a year later, as a fragile
peace agreement has stayed the fighting in one of Africa's cruelest
wars, Jarka is still alive _ a living symbol of the terror of that
dark time. By Norimitsu Onishi. (With a map.)
</P>
<P>
   MEXICO-ELECTION-PANEL (Mexico City) _ If there is one reason
Mexico expects to break with decades-old tradition and have a clean
and fair presidential election next year, it is that an elections
council will oversee the vote. By Julia Preston.
</P>
<P>
   INDIA-NUKE-POLICY (New Delhi, India) _ For the past week, many
of India's political elite have been thinking about that most
chilling of subjects: the hows and whys of building a nuclear
arsenal. The cause for this reflection was a six-page document
titled ``Indian Nuclear Doctrine.'' By Barry Bearak.
</P>
<P>
   INDIA-PHILANTHROPIST _ Dominique Lapierre has ranged over
several continents in his best-selling books on modern history, but
only one place has never let go of him. More than two decades ago,
after the publication of ``Freedom at Midnight,'' the story of
Indian independence, Mr. Lapierre went back to India to try to
share his success with the people who had inspired his work. ``It
was the beginning of an adventure that never stopped,'' he said in
an interview during a recent stopover in New York. He was on his
way home to France with his wife, also named Dominique, after
talking to business executives in Aspen, Colo., about the private
aid projects the couple finance. By Barbara Crossette.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NATIONAL &LR;  (Moving in ``a'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   HP-GLASS-CEILING (Palo Alto, Calif.) _ Hewlett-Packard's
elevation of Carly Fiorina to the post of chief executive last
month solidified the company's reputation as a bastion of
egalitarianism in a male-dominated corporate world. With more than
a quarter of Hewlett-Packard's managers women _ including one who
was a main rival of Ms. Fiorina for the top job _ it seemed
incontestable that the glass ceiling that stops the rise of female
executives at so many other companies had been shattered. But what
enlightened soul shattered it? The surprising answer: a middle-aged
white guy who never thought much about women in the workplace _
until he was thrust suddenly into the uncomfortable role of single
parent. By Reed Abelson. (With a photo.)
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-VACATION (Edgartown, Mass.) _ A year ago, President
Clinton made a faltering speech about forgiveness and attracted
widespread media attention. Now, the language of forgive and forget
rolls off his tongue in a manner that no longer surprises and,
perhaps more importantly, no longer carries the freighted question
of whether he will be forgiven. Clinton and his wife, Hillary
Rodham Clinton, are back on Martha's Vineyard for their fifth
summer vacation. By Katharine Q. Seelye.
</P>
<P>
   SILICON-VALLEY-TRAFFIC (San Francisco) _ For many professionals
at dot-com companies in Silicon Valley, the boom in the Internet
has resulted in a commuting bust, forcing them to funnel onto
increasingly congested highways that snake in and around the
crowded Bay Area. From San Francisco to San Jose, the expanding
economy has created a traffic jam of unprecedented proportions. By
Laura M. Holson. (With a photo and a map.)
</P>
<P>
   URBAN-ARMY-SCHOOL (Ft. Knox, Ky.) _ The Army has spent millions
to build a 26 acre mock city, full of high-tech simulation borrowed
from amusement parks, for training armored forces in urban combat.
But like a Hollywood set from a movie that was never shot, the site
is unused because the armor school has not decided where it fits
into the curriculum. By Steven A. Holmes.
</P>
<P>
   YEAR-2000-DOOMSAYER _ For months, government officials have
worried that zealous pessimists about the world's preparations for
Year 2000 computer problems could stir panic. Thanks to a prominent
doomsayer named Jim Lord, they have a fresh example of what they
fear. By Barnaby J. Feder.
</P>
<P>
   WORLD-CHESS-MATCH _ The gathering of attention among chess
devotees that accompanies the start of any world championship
match, either at the site of play or at computer terminals around
the world, was under way in earnest Saturday as the title match of
the International Chess Federation went through final preparations
for its opening Sunday evening at Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas. By
Robert Byrne.
</P>
<P>
   YELLOWSTONE-LAND-DEAL (Washington) _ The federal government and
a new age church have completed a deal that protects bison and
geysers in Yellowstone National Park, President Clinton announced
Saturday in his weekly radio address. By Matthew L. Wald.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; POLITICS &LR;  (Moving in ``p'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   BUSH-MEDIA-POLITICS _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush's refusal to
give a ``yes'' or ``no'' answer when asked if he had used cocaine
had been old news since his first campaign for governor of Texas in
1994. Then, he rebuffed the question with the words: ``What I did
as a kid? I don't think it's relevant.'' There the question and
answer stood, basically unchanged, as the Governor rose to national
political prominence. But in the last three weeks, the alchemy of
repetition made the old question new news in some news outlets. By
Felicity Barringer.
</P>
<P>
   NM-GOV-DRUGS (Undated) _ The Republican governor of New Mexico,
who has admitted he used cocaine in college, is the highest-ranking
official to call for decriminalizing of drugs. By Michael Janofsky.
(With a photo.)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WASHINGTON &LR;  (Moving in ``w'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   MEDICAID-LEAD-POISON (Washington) _ Federal investigators say
most states are flouting a 1989 law under which all children on
Medicaid are supposed to be tested for lead poisoning. By Robert
Pear.
</P>
<P>
   HMO-DRUG-STUDY (Washington) _ While many Medicare beneficiaries
have prescription drug benefits through health maintenance
organizations, a new study shows that there are wide variations in
those benefits and that some are quite modest. By Robin Toner.

FAMILY BRINGS ITS OWN RESCUE OPERATION TO EARTHQUAKE SITE 
</HEADLINE>
  (With TURKEY-QUAKE) 
(mk) 
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   GOLCUK, Turkey _ It was shortly after midnight Saturday morning
when members of the Aydin family finally took a break from digging
out corpses of their relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Golcuk, pulverized by Turkey's huge earthquake on Tuesday,
seemed a scene from hell. Its buildings are in rubble, most of its
residents evacuated _ or dead; its air is increasingly unbreathable
from decaying flesh.
</P>
<P>
   But the Aydins were an island of calm. A clan of nearly 40
brothers, sisters, cousins and spouses, they had traveled nearly
600 miles from the eastern city of Erzincan to rescue or at least
bury five trapped relatives. They have met with both success and
grief.
</P>
<P>
   They had brought their own jackhammers, drills, electric
generators and lights. They had worked around the clock, taking
shifts. And now, camped in front of an abandoned school, they
relaxed i the soft glow of candlelight to drink tea and smoke
cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't escape earthquakes,'' said Ridvan Aydin, 30, who
helps manage the family construction company. ``We worked hard back
in Erzincan to build earthquake-proof houses, only to find
ourselves called into this earthquake here.''
</P>
<P>
   Turkey is a nation built around families and extended families,
but they have been particularly crucial in the aftermath of the
earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   As of Friday, the government had yet to provide tents or toilets
for the hundreds of thousands of people wh have become homeless.
Food, water and commodities like soap and diapers have been
distributed almost entirely by charitable groups and as donations
by private companies.
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of government coordination, families and
neighbors have set up impromptu tent communities and mutual-support
networks from Istanbul and Izmit.
</P>
<P>
   It is common to find three generations of a family sleeping on
the same blanket and setting up routines to divide the labor. Men
help one another excavating bodies. Mothers and grandmothers focus
on food preparation, figuring out ways to cook okra with few
seasonings available, except for tomatoes.
</P>
<P>
   At Anik Park near the Izmit bay, neighbors serve each other tea
in Turkish tea glasses and silver saucers in the evenings. They
also cluster to watch television sets connected by very long
extension cords to the park's meeting hall.
</P>
<P>
   But the Aydin family may be in a league of its own.
</P>
<P>
   Over in Izmit, for all the damaged buildings, there are still
people and power and open stores. But Golcuk, where they have come,
is demolished and rotting. Nights are dominated by screaming
ambulances and excavation crews digging up bodies under the white
glare of spotlights. Fears about cholera and typhoid outbreaks are
mounting daily, and rumors about a possible quarantine of the city
are circulating widely.
</P>
<P>
   Small wonder that most residents have fled for villages in the
nearby hills, coming back only to watch excavation of their
buildings. The Aydins, by contrast, not only have set up a
permanent camp but also have begun helping out on other buildings.
</P>
<P>
   The Aydins also brought what amounted to their own engineering
corps.
</P>
<P>
   Construction is the family business, and dealing with
earthquakes is a long tradition in Erzincan, which was hit by a
deadly one in 1939 that killed 30,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government has been rather weak,'' said Ridvan Aydin.
``But we know a lot about earthquakes and we know where to start
looking for people.''
</P>
<P>
   The Aydins were pulled to Golcuk by both loyalty and grief. The
loyalty was to Ridvan's mother and the family matriarch, Fazilet,
who had lived here years ago when her husband found work at the
factories in Izmit. Fazilet formed the center of the family group
that came here for the rescue operation.
</P>
<P>
   The grief centered on a 4-year-old girl named Halil, the
daughter of Ridvan and his wife, Sevil. Halil had come for a visit
with her maternal grandmother, who lives in Golcuk. Of the five
relatives who had been trapped when their house fell in on them
Tuesday, Halil was the only one still missing.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first came I had no idea of how bad the destruction
was,'' said Ridvan. ``I immediately called back home and told them
I needed electric generators and a lot of other equipment.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ridvan scored a huge victory even before the reinforcements
arrived. Thirty-three hours after the quake, he pulled out his
wife's still-living mother, Hamide Celebi. She was badly bruised
and weak, but a government helicopter whisked her away to a
hospital in Istanbul.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept shouting to my mother that everything would be fine
because Ridvan was here to get her out,'' said Sevil.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a huge clan of brothers, cousins, nephews, nieces and
wives organized themselves into a caravan of trucks and cars and
the next day. By that point, the road to Golcuk was so choked with
similar rescue efforts that it took more than four hours to drive
the last 10 miles from Izmit.
</P>
<P>
   What they encountered here was unmitigated mayhem. Thanks to
hundreds of truckloads of food and water donated by companies
across Turkey, hunger was not a problem.
</P>
<P>
   But government relief operations were a disaster. There were
almost no portable electric generators, necessary for lights to
keep searching at night. It took two full days for government
bulldozers and cranes to arrive at buildings in which people had
been trapped.
</P>
<P>
   The family members quickly commandeered an empty school just a
few doors from the collapsed house that held their kin here. They
laid out blankets in front along with a couple of tiny plastic
tables for eating.
</P>
<P>
   They also brought out the family samovar, the tall silver
Turkish kettles used for serving tea. The family had brought their
own bottled water and propane stove, and they tapped the school's
well for washing water.
</P>
<P>
   The men, ranging from teen-agers to fathers in their '40s,
divided themselves into two 12-hour shifts a day. The women made
meals and kept the rudimentary house in order.
</P>
<P>
   By late Friday night, they had extracted two of the remaining
three bodies belonging to relatives. The one that was still missing
was Halil's.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until just a few minutes ago, we had been working 24 hours a
day in shifts,'' said Sevil. ``But even if we had to work two full
days straight, I don't think I would feel tired.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ Last September, when Bob Dole, the former
presidential candidate, and John Shattuck, an American human rights
official, came here to press Slobodan Milosevic to relent in
Kosovo, the Yugoslav president put on quite a performance.
</P>
<P>
   He rejected charges of Serb abuses of ethnic Albanians in
Kosovo, of course, and then, acting offended, had an aide shut the
doors leading to a dining room already set for lunch. Just before
Dole and Shattuck left, unfed, Milosevic leaned forward and said
emphatically, in his good English, ``You know, I enjoy being
president.''
</P>
<P>
   No one doubts him. Nor do they underestimate his tactical
skills. Defeated by NATO in Kosovo, wanted for trial on war crimes
and facing a restive constituency, Milosevic will not give up the
job easily. Remaining president is surely safest place for
Milosevic to be.
</P>
<P>
   Having survived more than 80 days of massive street protests
against him in the winter of 1996-97 and 78 days of NATO bombing
last spring, Milosevic is doing his best to manipulate and
discredit a divided opposition.
</P>
<P>
   His efforts are falling, as ever here, on rich ground. The first
opposition rally in Belgrade, on Thursday night, drew tens of
thousands of people demanding his resignation. But the rally also
displayed and intensified the already poisonous splits in the
opposition between the Democratic Party of Zoran Djindjic and the
Serbian Renewal Movement of Vuk Draskovic.
</P>
<P>
   It is indisputable that Milosevic is in deep trouble. His regime
has been shaken; a few of his acolytes are breaking away; there is
no longer enough money, given war damage and international
isolation, to keep his network of favored business allies happy.
</P>
<P>
   There are worries about a winter without enough heat,
electricity and fuel for transportation, and about an economy,
already in deep recession, bombed into a sort of pre-industrial
stage by NATO, without enough real jobs.
</P>
<P>
   After 10 years in power, Milosevic's support is at its lowest
point. He and his government, never wildly popular, are reviled by
large portions of the nation. Serbs are tired of empty promises,
patriotic hyperbole and failed wars that leave Serbia smaller and
more isolated, its people poorer and its future bleaker.
</P>
<P>
   Some opinion polls suggest that the main opposition party,
Draskovic's party would win more votes than the parties of
Milosevic and his wife, Mirjana Markovic, combined. According to
one recent poll, Milosevic's party gets roughly 14 percent of the
vote; Mrs. Markovic's, 2.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But even Draskovic could win only up to 18 percent of the vote,
and Djindjic would probably win no more than possibly 10 percent,
requiring a coalition to hammer together a working majority in the
Serb or Yugoslav parliaments. And it is in coalition politics _ the
game of pressure, seduction, blackmail and reward _ that Milosevic
is Serbia's master.
</P>
<P>
   He keeps power by playing off Draskovic and the
ultranationalist, Vojislav Seselj. Until recently, Milosevic
retained a majority on the federal level in coalition with
Draskovic and on the more important Serbian level with Seselj.
While Draskovic left the government during the war, and Seselj
vowed to quit over the withdrawal from Kosovo, Seselj is now
Milosevic's coalition partner in both governments.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, Milosevic's party leaked a story that he had met
Draskovic secretly to work out a deal on early elections. While
Draskovic vehemently denied any meeting, he does favor early
elections, and his aides blame the leak on Djindjic. Whatever the
truth, the leak was a brilliant stroke to widen opposition
divisions and make a bad relationship even worse.
</P>
<P>
   In a formerly Communist system where little has changed in the
structure of power, Milosevic and his wife hold strong, centralized
cards to play: a controlled state media, business monopolies, state
industries, import licenses, the army and especially the police.
</P>
<P>
   Favored people who play along can make a great deal of money,
with good apartments and insider deals. Those who show disloyalty
or challenge the regime are rarely arrested, but they suddenly lose
their perks and face police or tax harassment. And a few _ not
many, but enough to discourage the others _ have ended up dead, in
mysterious circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   One key official of an opposition party said in an interview
that he was offered more than $50,000 to defect to Milosevic's
Socialist Party. He said he refused on principle. But he noted a
common pattern of power, because he was also offered money, though
considerably less, to defect to another opposition party, which he
also declined to do.
</P>
<P>
   None of this is to say that Milosevic will manage to save
himself through the autumn, let alone to the end of his term in
2001 or beyond. But he has managed thus far to divide and conquer,
buying time and waiting for opportunities to emerge that could
leave him in place.
</P>
<P>
   A senior opposition figure, speaking privately, honestly and
sadly, said: ``Even in such trouble, Milosevic remains the master
of the political game, especially with this sort of opposition. We
should be able to beat him easily, but he manipulates and
discredits us. Ordinary people sense there is something wrong with
this opposition. It gives him lots of games to play.''

   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ Last September, when Bob Dole, the former
presidential candidate, and John Shattuck, an American human rights
official, came here to press Slobodan Milosevic to relent in
Kosovo, the Yugoslav president put on quite a performance.
</P>
<P>
   He rejected charges of Serb abuses of ethnic Albanians in
Kosovo, of course, and then, acting offended, had an aide shut the
doors leading to a dining room already set for lunch. Just before
Dole and Shattuck left, unfed, Milosevic leaned forward and said
emphatically, in his good English, ``You know, I enjoy being
president.''
</P>
<P>
   No one doubts him. Nor do they underestimate his tactical
skills. Defeated by NATO in Kosovo, wanted for trial on war crimes
and facing a restive constituency, Milosevic will not give up the
job easily. Remaining president is surely safest place for
Milosevic to be.
</P>
<P>
   Having survived more than 80 days of massive street protests
against him in the winter of 1996-97 and 78 days of NATO bombing
last spring, Milosevic is doing his best to manipulate and
discredit a divided opposition.
</P>
<P>
   His efforts are falling, as ever here, on rich ground. The first
opposition rally in Belgrade, on Thursday night, drew tens of
thousands of people demanding his resignation. But the rally also
displayed and intensified the already poisonous splits in the
opposition between the Democratic Party of Zoran Djindjic and the
Serbian Renewal Movement of Vuk Draskovic.
</P>
<P>
   It is indisputable that Milosevic is in deep trouble. His regime
has been shaken; a few of his acolytes are breaking away; there is
no longer enough money, given war damage and international
isolation, to keep his network of favored business allies happy.
</P>
<P>
   There are worries about a winter without enough heat,
electricity and fuel for transportation, and about an economy,
already in deep recession, bombed into a sort of pre-industrial
stage by NATO, without enough real jobs.
</P>
<P>
   After 10 years in power, Milosevic's support is at its lowest
point. He and his government, never wildly popular, are reviled by
large portions of the nation. Serbs are tired of empty promises,
patriotic hyperbole and failed wars that leave Serbia smaller and
more isolated, its people poorer and its future bleaker.
</P>
<P>
   Some opinion polls suggest that the main opposition party,
Draskovic's party would win more votes than the parties of
Milosevic and his wife, Mirjana Markovic, combined. According to
one recent poll, Milosevic's party gets roughly 14 percent of the
vote; Mrs. Markovic's, 2.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But even Draskovic could win only up to 18 percent of the vote,
and Djindjic would probably win no more than possibly 10 percent,
requiring a coalition to hammer together a working majority in the
Serb or Yugoslav parliaments. And it is in coalition politics _ the
game of pressure, seduction, blackmail and reward _ that Milosevic
is Serbia's master.
</P>
<P>
   He keeps power by playing off Draskovic and the
ultranationalist, Vojislav Seselj. Until recently, Milosevic
retained a majority on the federal level in coalition with
Draskovic and on the more important Serbian level with Seselj.
While Draskovic left the government during the war, and Seselj
vowed to quit over the withdrawal from Kosovo, Seselj is now
Milosevic's coalition partner in both governments.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, Milosevic's party leaked a story that he had met
Draskovic secretly to work out a deal on early elections. While
Draskovic vehemently denied any meeting, he does favor early
elections, and his aides blame the leak on Djindjic. Whatever the
truth, the leak was a brilliant stroke to widen opposition
divisions and make a bad relationship even worse.
</P>
<P>
   In a formerly Communist system where little has changed in the
structure of power, Milosevic and his wife hold strong, centralized
cards to play: a controlled state media, business monopolies, state
industries, import licenses, the army and especially the police.
</P>
<P>
   Favored people who play along can make a great deal of money,
with good apartments and insider deals. Those who show disloyalty
or challenge the regime are rarely arrested, but they suddenly lose
their perks and face police or tax harassment. And a few _ not
many, but enough to discourage the others _ have ended up dead, in
mysterious circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   One key official of an opposition party said in an interview
that he was offered more than $50,000 to defect to Milosevic's
Socialist Party. He said he refused on principle. But he noted a
common pattern of power, because he was also offered money, though
considerably less, to defect to another opposition party, which he
also declined to do.
</P>
<P>
   None of this is to say that Milosevic will manage to save
himself through the autumn, let alone to the end of his term in
2001 or beyond. But he has managed thus far to divide and conquer,
buying time and waiting for opportunities to emerge that could
leave him in place.
</P>
<P>
   A senior opposition figure, speaking privately, honestly and
sadly, said: ``Even in such trouble, Milosevic remains the master
of the political game, especially with this sort of opposition. We
should be able to beat him easily, but he manipulates and
discredits us. Ordinary people sense there is something wrong with
this opposition. It gives him lots of games to play.''

STATES FAULTED FOR LAX LEAD-TESTING OF POOR YOUTH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.J., Conn., Wash., Calif., Mont., Ala., Colo.)  (js) 
 By ROBERT PEAR    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Federal investigators say most states are flouting
a 1989 law that requires young children on Medicaid to be tested
for lead poisoning. As a result, they say, hundreds of thousands of
children exposed to dangerously high levels of lead are neither
tested nor treated.
</P>
<P>
   The General Accounting Office, an investigative arm of Congress,
found that ``few Medicaid children are screened for blood-lead
levels,'' even though the problem of lead poisoning is concentrated
among low-income children on Medicaid. Medicaid recipients are
three times as likely as other children to have high amounts of
lead in the blood.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, a federal advisory panel said last week that
``current lead screening rates among children covered by Medicaid
are very poor, despite federal requirements.''
</P>
<P>
   Cost is not the main reason for the failure to test children,
health officials say. The laboratory test usually costs less than
$10.
</P>
<P>
   Officials cite more complex reasons for the low rates of
testing. Many doctors do not see lead exposure as a problem for
their patients and therefore do not believe tests are necessary, or
they are unaware of the federal requirements. In addition, many
poor children do not go to the doctor until they are sick, and most
children with high levels of lead in the blood display no obvious
symptoms at first.
</P>
<P>
   Under federal law, states are responsible for the screening of
children on Medicaid. They can provide such services directly or
they can arrange for the services to be provided by doctors,
clinics and health maintenance organizations.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has repeatedly emphasized that all government
policies should be evaluated for their effects on children. But the
accounting office found that most of the children served by
Medicaid and other federal health programs were not tested for
lead, as federal law and regulations say they should be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Federal lead-screening policies are often not followed'' by
state officials, and the Federal Health Care Financing
Administration, which supervises Medicaid, does not review state
compliance with these policies, the auditors said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says 890,000
children under the age of 6 have so much lead in their blood that
it could harm their health or their ability to learn.
</P>
<P>
   More than 80 percent of all children ages 1 to 5 who require
medical treatment for lead poisoning are enrolled in Medicaid, but
fewer than 20 percent of Medicaid recipients in that age group are
ever tested, the General Accounting Office found.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a dismal record,'' said Sen. Robert G. Torricelli,
D-N.J., who recently introduced a bill to increase lead testing of
children.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The state auditor of California, Kurt R. Sjoberg, reached a
similar conclusion in a new report on the experience of that state,
which has far more Medicaid recipients than any other state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thousands of lead-poisoned children have been allowed to
suffer needlessly'' because California has not complied with the
federal requirement to test them for lead poisoning, Sjoberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Susan K. Cummins, chief of the state's lead poisoning
prevention program, said perhaps 20 percent of the children on
Medicaid in California had been tested for lead. ``And that's
probably an optimistic estimate,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Federal rules say that children on Medicaid must be tested for
lead poisoning at the age of 12 months and again at 24 months.
Medicaid recipients ages 3 to 6 must also be tested if they have
not previously been screened.
</P>
<P>
   Screening rates vary greatly from state to state. In Washington
state, federal auditors found that fewer than 1 percent of the
children on Medicaid had been tested for lead poisoning. Elsewhere,
they said, rates range from 3 percent in Montana to 10 percent in
Colorado, 40 percent in New Jersey and 46 percent in Alabama. Many
states, including Connecticut, said they did not have statewide
data on testing rates or the prevalence of lead poisoning.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   New York has a state law that requires day-care centers and
nursery schools to ask parents for evidence of screening. The New
York City Health Department reported that more than 40 percent of
children ages 1 to 5 had been tested.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the federal requirements, Thomas W. Bedell, the Medicaid
director in Washington state, said: ``We don't believe we have much
of a problem with lead exposure here. So we don't think it's
cost-effective to impose 100 percent screening. There are better
ways to spend our money.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Maxine D. Hayes, the acting health officer for Washington
state, added, ``We don't think it's right for the federal
government to dictate what states should do'' in testing children.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Under federal rules, Medicaid will pay for testing and treating
a child, but will not pay for testing of substances like water and
paint that are sent to a laboratory for analysis.
</P>
<P>
   Public health experts say this policy often cripples efforts to
identify the cause of a child's lead poisoning.
</P>
<P>
   The advisory panel that voiced concern about the low rates of
screening also said last week that Medicaid should pay for
laboratory tests of dust, water and other substances in the homes
of children poisoned by lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Such testing is good public health policy, and it's definitely
the standard of care for treating lead-poisoned kids,'' said Dr.
Cummins, the chairwoman of the panel, the Advisory Committee on
Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention, which expressed its views in a
letter to Donna E. Shalala, the secretary of health and human
services.
</P>
<P>
   Heather M. Mauro, a resident of Atco, N.J., said she felt
fortunate that her children had been tested for lead because the
tests detected high levels of lead in all four youngsters. But she
said: ``After six years, we are still trying to rebuild our home,
one room at a time, to remove the lead. It has cost us thousands
and thousands of dollars.'' The home, a large Victorian, was built
in the late 1800s or early 1900s.
</P>
<P>
   Lead poisoning can cause learning disabilities, behavior
problems and neurological damage in children, and Mrs. Mauro said
she believed that her children had suffered such problems because
of exposure to lead.
</P>
<P>
   Since lead has been removed from gasoline and food cans,
children are most likely to encounter it now in old paint and in
dust contaminated with such paint. More than 80 percent of homes
built before 1978 have lead-based paint in them.

   State officials across the country are encouraging families on
Medicaid to join health maintenance organizations. But Sara
Rosenbaum, a professor of health law and policy at George
Washington University, said that in their contracts with HMOs,
states rarely specified the full range of services that should be
provided to children with lead poisoning.
</P>
<P>
   In New Jersey, Edward J. Rogan, a spokesman for the Department
of Human Services, said ``we are not happy'' with the fact that
only 40 percent of children on Medicaid have been tested for lead
poisoning. ``We want to strengthen our contracts with HMOs to make
sure they achieve a greater level of screening,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut officials said they did not have statewide data on
lead testing of Medicaid recipients. In Hartford, where doctors and
hospitals have made special efforts to eliminate lead poisoning, a
recent study of 877 preschoolers found that 93 percent had been
tested. But Judith Solomon, executive director of the Children's
Health Council, a child advocacy group, said, ``We don't assume the
results would be the same in other parts of the state.''

<P>
   PALO ALTO, Calif. _ Hewlett-Packard's elevation of Carly Fiorina
to the post of chief executive last month solidified the company's
reputation as a bastion of egalitarianism in a male-dominated
corporate world. With more than a quarter of Hewlett-Packard's
managers women _ including one who was a main rival of Ms. Fiorina
for the top job _ it seemed incontestable that the glass ceiling
that stops the rise of female executives at so many other companies
had been shattered.
</P>
<P>
   But who hurled the rock?
</P>
<P>
   The surprising answer: a middle-aged white guy who never thought
much about women in the workplace _ until he was thrust suddenly
into the challenging role of single parent.
</P>
<P>
   The struggle of Lewis E. Platt, now the company's 58-year-old
chairman, to juggle the competing duties of father and breadwinner
when he was a rising senior executive nearly two decades ago had a
happy ending for Hewlett-Packard. And his success in turning
company policy around from the traditional ``man rules the roost''
culture to a gender-blind ethos holds an important lesson for the
rest of corporate America: A little direction at the top can go a
long way.
</P>
<P>
   It all began in 1981. Back then, Platt was a general manager,
and Hewlett-Packard was what he describes as a ``white male
haven,'' populated by graduates of engineering schools in dark
suits with starched white shirts. He was, he says, quite
comfortable working in that male-dominated environment and leaving
the child-rearing and housekeeping chores to his wife of 16 years,
Susan.
</P>
<P>
   Then, his world fell apart: Susan died of cancer, and suddenly,
he was the one who had to make dinner for his two daughters, Laura
and Caryn, then 9 and 11, get them to school, make sure they did
their homework in the evenings and even find the time to go grocery
shopping.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother had really been the one running the show on the home
front,'' said Caryn, now 29, who runs her own social services
business. She has memories of standing with her father and her
sister in a supermarket aisle wondering whether there were enough
varieties of Hamburger Helper, one of the few dishes Platt could
prepare, to dine on that week.
</P>
<P>
   His sudden vulnerability, Platt says, shattered his old
assumption that any difficulties women had in the workplace were of
their own making. ``Here I was a white male, doing really well at
HP,'' Platt recalled in an interview at the company's headquarters
in Palo Alto, Calif. ``I was suddenly thrust into a different
role.''
</P>
<P>
   In the position of having double duty at home and at work, ``I
couldn't cope any better than they did,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For six months after his wife's death, he said, his co-workers
allowed him to grieve and concentrate on getting his personal life
in order instead of putting his full energy into his career. ``I
was probably a pretty marginal performer,'' he admitted, but he
came to understand the ebb and flow of careers. ``One day I would
be back and give the time and energy to be a senior manager,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   As the months rolled by, his life remained frantic, he says, a
never-ending grind of traveling, working late in the office,
getting up early to be with his children and turning to
grandparents or nannies to care for them when he was not around. At
one point, he debated leaving Hewlett-Packard; but as a lifelong
employee, who had joined right out of business school in 1966 and
worked his way up the ladder, he soldiered on.
</P>
<P>
   When he married again in 1983, his second wife, Joan, took over
the household responsibilities, freeing him to indulge his
workaholic tendencies. But rather than retreating to his old way of
thinking, he found he sympathized with the plight of the average
working woman more than ever. The new Mrs. Platt had two daughters
of her own, Amanda and Hillary, then 9 and 7, and surrounded as he
was as the sole male, he had little choice but to look at their
side of things, noted his daughter, Caryn. ``We would gang up on
him pretty mercilessly,'' she recalled. All four daughters are now
working.
</P>
<P>
   Named a vice president in 1983, Platt continued his ascent at
Hewlett-Packard, managing various parts of the company's computer
business before becoming an executive vice president in 1987.
During that time, more women were rising to the level of manager,
but few were making it to the highest ranks.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he became chief executive in 1992, he says, droves
of those women managers were leaving. ``The pipeline didn't look
very good,'' he said. After an outside consultant conducted
interviews with many of these women, he came to realize that
despite his own open-mindedness on the subject, the company's
policies were not flexible enough to accommodate their lives
outside the workplace.
</P>
<P>
   What concerned him in particular were the women in their late
30s who left the company to devote more time to their children,
never to be seen again. ``They were gone,'' Platt said. ``We were
no longer connected to them.''
</P>
<P>
   So he decided to take action. Working with other top executives,
Platt developed what for Hewlett-Packard was a new workplace
strategy. Over the next several years, the company began to
encourage employees to adjust their workweeks, arrange flexible
work schedules, work at home if necessary and even share jobs _ all
so that they could meet their personal responsibilities. They could
even take sabbaticals _ yearlong unpaid leaves from the company _
no questions asked.
</P>
<P>
   While many companies offer these options, few corporations
actually encourage their use. Hewlett-Packard did. Platt made
speeches, reminding managers that they needed to consider seriously
any of their employees' requests to take advantage of this new
flexibility, and he put his name on memos sent to managers across
the world. ``Work/life issues are a business priority,'' one
statement said. ``Attention to work/life issues strengthens HP's
competitive edge and improves teamwork within HP.''
</P>
<P>
   Even high-level employees take advantage of the new flexibility.
Janice Chaffin, an 18-year Hewlett-Packard employee and general
manager in charge of providing large computer systems to companies,
for example, shared that position, just one rank below division
president at the company, for a year.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Chaffin says she has never come under any pressure to put in
time in the office for the sake of appearance _ her bosses' boss
even encouraged her to make clear to her own manager, who was known
for spending nearly every waking hour at the office, that she would
not do the same. ``It was never an issue,'' she said.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all employees determine their own hours to some extent,
according to the company, and large numbers opt to work at home at
least some of the time. About 12 percent have formal telecommuting
arrangements, and employees are routinely asked about how receptive
their managers are to their needs in balancing work with the rest
of their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most important, Platt has been vocal on the issue,
according to Jerry Cashman, the company's director of programs that
encourage work-life balance and diversity. He also likes to remind
male colleagues of some of the built-in disadvantages women operate
under; he never tires of noting that while the vast majority of
them are married to men who work, two-thirds of male managers have
stay-at-home wives.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Platt says the new policy is not just the right thing to do _ it
is the smart thing. ``Anything you can do to attract and retain the
best talent is really critical,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The results, in fact, have been dramatic. In the early '90s, the
turnover for women was twice that of men, according to the company;
now, the gap has been eliminated and the rates are almost
identical. Moreover, the company says it loses fewer than 5 percent
of its employees each year, compared with an industry average that
the consulting firm William M. Mercer puts at 17 percent.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Brenda Vathauer, a high-powered marketing manager, says the
freedom to set her own agenda persuaded her to return to
Hewlett-Packard after her maternity leave. But she found herself in
an odd position: She did not want a part-time job, which she noted
is too often considered a ``subjob'' at most companies, but she did
not want to work the 60 hours of a typical full-time job, either.
</P>
<P>
   The solution: She teamed up with another working mother to share
a full-time management position in customer service. Each woman now
puts in three 10-hour days a week, each receives three-quarters pay
and benefits _ and each gets to spend four days a week at home,
counting weekends. ``You can keep your career more on track,''
explained Karen Walker, her partner in the enterprise and a mother
of three.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Men make use of the company's programs, too. Bill Hornung, also
a customer-service manager, describes himself as ``a telecommuter
poster child'' for other men because he works at home so can he
care for his two children, 5 and 9, when his wife, a flight
attendant, is in the air.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Hewlett-Packard is not an equal-opportunity utopia.
Platt readily admits that the company has had difficulty recruiting
and promoting blacks. The company said it does not disclose the
percentage of managers within certain ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, to the outside world, the promotion of Ms. Fiorina to
chief executive _ she is only the third woman now heading a Fortune
500 company _ was seen as a groundbreaking event. And though it was
greeted as policy as usual inside the company, some Hewlett-Packard
employees reveled in the symbolism. Just as the victory of the
American women's soccer team provided important role models for
young women, so did the selection of Ms. Fiorina, they say.
</P>
<P>
   Bart Coddington, who works with analysts studying the computer
industry for the company, says his 3-year-old granddaughter,
Sydney, ``will grow up with all that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just so excited for her,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the white, middle-aged guy responsible for ushering in
this era of equality will step down as chairman at the end of the
year, what about the woman who replaced him as chief executive?
When she was appointed, Ms. Fiorina made a widely reported,
controversial assertion that there was no glass ceiling. She has
since told colleagues that her remark may not apply throughout
corporate America, and she has emphasized the need to look for
talent wherever it can be found, regardless of sex, race or age.
She is not giving interviews.
</P>
<P>
   As for Platt, he is leaving it up to the company's employees to
make sure Hewlett-Packard does not revert to its old self. Specific
programs are not important, he says. ``It's the core values.''

COLD FEET DOOM STEPASHIN'S MARRIAGE OF CONVENIENCE IN RUSSIA 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MICHAEL R. GORDON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ If ever there was an example of how hard it is for
Russia's liberal politicians to work together it was the implosion
Saturday of Sergei Stepashin's new centrist electoral bloc.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday was expected to be the day when Stepashin, who was
ousted from his prime minister's post by President Boris Yeltsin
this month, announced he would be leading the new alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Stepashin surprised much of the country by declaring
somewhat bitterly that he had failed to pull together the disparate
group of democrats and power brokers and would now be going it
alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bringing people together who cannot be united is impossible,''
the 47-year-old Stepashin told the Russian news service Interfax
Saturday. ``Their personal ambitions are too big.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of serving as the standard-bearer of a new center-right
alternative to Yevgeny Primakov, the enigmatic former prime
minister who leads in the opinion polls, Stepashin will run for a
seat in the Parliament as a representative from St. Petersburg.
</P>
<P>
   With Russia entering a political season of expedient alliances
and back-room deals it is possible that some liberals and centrists
might form new marriages of convenience. But the immediate effect
of Stepashin's failure to form a new coalition was to improve the
prospects of Primakov and his new political ally, Yuri Luzhkov, the
pugnacious Moscow mayor.
</P>
<P>
   The goal of the the Primakov-Luzhkov coalition is to capture a
dominant position in the Parliament in elections scheduled for
December and to use those gains as a springboard in the 2000
presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently aiming at the ultimate prize _ the Kremlin _ Luzhkov
on Saturday assailed Yeltsin and the economic reformers who once
served him as a threat to Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The country is being robbed in a way that is unprecedented in
its cynicism and permissiveness,'' said Luzhkov, whose own city
government is no paragon of probity.
</P>
<P>
   Just Friday night, the Russian news media were reporting that a
Stepashin-led coalition was starting to jell. A key element of the
emerging alliance, the media reported, was Viktor Chernomyrdin's
movement, Our Home Is Russia. By linking up with Chernomyrdin,
another former prime minister, Stepashin hoped to capture the
political center.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, however, aides to Chernomyrdin disclosed that the
coalition began to fall when Chernomyrdin refused to include the
Democratic Choice party of Yegor Gaidar, another former prime
minister, who played a historic role in building capitalism by
liberalizing prices following the collapse of the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Another deal breaker was Chernomyrdin's refusal to allow yet
another former prime minister, Sergei Kiriyenko, who was another
prospective member of the bloc, to be listed among the top three
leaders of the alliance in the parliamentary slate.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin still hoped to form some sort of centrist bloc with
Stepashin at the head. But Stepashin called Saturday to say he was
not interested.
</P>
<P>
   The collapse of the effort was a particular setback for some of
Russia's most ardent democrats and supporters of capitalism, like
Gaidar. They are in a particularly difficult position because of
the rules governing parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
   In order to win a place in the Parliament, a party must receive
at least 5 percent of the Parliamentary vote. Gaidar's party was
unable to overcome this threshold in the 1996 parliamentary
election and has little chance of doing so this year.
</P>
<P>
   The Just Cause movement faces a similar problem. That movement
includes Boris Fyodorov, the blunt-spoken former tax collector and
free-marketeer, and Boris Netsov, the telegenic pro-reform former
Kremlin aide.
</P>
<P>
   So does the New Force movement established by Kiriyenko. Even
without Chernomyrdin, these liberal groups would be in a better
position if they all worked together.
</P>
<P>
   But Kiriyenko has been reluctant to associate himself too
closely with Gaidar and with Anatoly Chubais, a member of Gaidar's
party, the former director of the program to privatize state
property and the current chief of Russia's electricity monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody has a fear of being associated too closely with
Gaidar and Chubais,'' said Andrei Piontkovsky, a political analyst.
``They are seen as responsible for everything that went right in
the move to a market economy and everything that was bad, like
crony capitalism.''
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Chernomyrdin, whose own popularity ratings are
nothing to brag about, indicated that he might still try to form a
new coalition with Kiriyenko, who apparently would play a kind of
junior role.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should not set up sort of one-day unions that are
premature,'' Chernomyrdin said, alluding to Stepashin's efforts.
``They will fall apart quickly afterward.''

   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, Aug. 22, will move Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   On the dress page: moving in the `a' category
</P>
<P>
   BUSH-REVIEW (Undated) _ Months after the Republican
establishment placed its bets for the party's presidential
nomination with Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, a reappraisal is
under way, fueled by a restless press corps, as well as by Bush's
opponents, freshly determined after his first-place finish in a
straw poll in Iowa a week ago to slow his seemingly effortless
march to the White House. By Richard L. Berke.
</P>
<P>
   ANIMAL-LAW-REVIEW (Undated) _ Here is a courtroom scene that
lawyers in the fledgling field of animal law say will unfold
sometime soon. A great ape will appear in the courtroom. A lawsuit
will have been filed in the animal's name. The ape will then
testify in sign language or using a voice synthesizer to support
the claim that, contrary to centuries of law, it has legal rights,
including a fundamental right to liberty. Fiction? Perhaps. But a
growing group of lawyers and legal academics say they are plotting
strategies to bring such a suit, perhaps within a decade. By
William Glaberson.
</P>
<P>
   DEATH-ROW-REVIEW (Undated) _ Since the U.S. Supreme Court
reinstated capital punishment in 1976, 566 people have been
executed. In that same period, 82 convicts awaiting execution have
been exonerated _ a ratio of one freed for every seven put to
death. About half of them were exonerated in the 1990s, six so far
this year. By Caitlin Lovinger.
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moving in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   AIR-SAFETY-REVIEW (Washington) _ Right after ``What does it
cost?'' the second question that almost every traveler planning a
trip on a foreign airline asks is: ``Is it safe?'' The average
ticket buyer can't get an answer, and even if the Federal Aviation
Administration knows, it is barred by treaty from saying. But
that's all about to change. By Matthew L. Wald.
</P>
<P>
   WITCHES-REVIEW (Undated) _ For at least one person who has seen
``The Blair Witch Project,'' the surprise hit movie of the summer
did not so much terrify as infuriate. One long slur against
witches, said Selena Fox, a witch, or Wicca, as male and female
American witches prefer to call themselves. By Anthony Ramirez.
</P>
<P>
   ECONOMY-REVIEW (Undated) _ There will be a recession. That is
inevitable _ if not this year, then next year or maybe the year
after. The question is, how severe will it be? The answer is that
despite all the fanfare about these prosperous times, the
eight-year expansion walks on precarious legs, and when it
collapses, getting the U.S. economy back on its feet could be
surprisingly hard and painful. By Louis Uchitelle.
</P>
<P>
   NEW-WORDS-REVIEW (Undated) _ By the time dictionary editors
accept a word as new, it's probably old to you.
</P>
<P>
   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some highlights of the week.
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moving in the `i' category:
</P>
<P>
   MILOSEVIC-REVIEW (Belgrade, Yugoslavia) _ Last September, when
Bob Dole, the former presidential candidate, and John Shattuck, an
American human rights official, came here to press Slobodan
Milosevic to relent in Kosovo, the Yugoslav president put on quite
a performance. He rejected charges of Serb abuses of ethnic
Albanians in Kosovo, and then, acting offended, had an aide shut
the doors leading to a dining room already set for lunch. Just
before Dole and Shattuck left, unfed, Milosevic leaned forward and
said emphatically, in his good English, ``You know, I enjoy being
president.'' By Steven Erlanger.
</P>
<P>
   TURKEY-GREECE-REVIEW (Istanbul, Turkey) _ Greece is often
described as Turkey's principal rival, and it has spent much of the
last quarter century blocking Turkish initiatives and ambitions.
But a remarkable outpouring from Greece after last week's
earthquake in Turkey, not just of aid but also of sentiment, shows
that a deeply felt sense of shared history and shared fate still
binds many Greeks and Turks. By Stephen Kinzer.
</P>
<P>
   PINOCHET-SYNDROME-REVIEW (United Nations) _ A new malady is
stalking the presidential palaces and bunkers of the world. Call it
the Pinochet Syndrome. By Barbara Crossette.

 By KIT R. ROANE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was only noon and Motty Notis was already halfway
into his race along 13th Avenue in the Borough Park section of
Brooklyn. Sacks of electronics, Judaic books and a wide-brimmed
black hat were strewn about the trunk of his rental car, and
arrangements had been made to ship dozens of other items.
</P>
<P>
   But with one hand on the steering wheel and the other hand
holding the cell phone through which his wife in Los Angeles gave
more orders, Notis set off again. There were silver Kiddush cups to
buy, possibly a camera and, if he had time to get them, some of
those nice white shirts he liked could be jammed inside his bag
before his 8 p.m. flight home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the best place to buy everything for a Jewish household,
so people from all over the world come to shop,'' said Notis, a
26-year-old general contractor, before zooming off in his car. ``A
lot of people fly in to shop in the morning and are back on a plane
by the afternoon. This is just the beginning for me. I've still got
to get a gift for my wife _ it's her birthday.''
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, the central shopping district of Borough Park
would not seem world-class. Parking is difficult, upscale
restaurants are few, and there are none of the famed stores that
draw shoppers to Manhattan _ like Bloomingdale's, Barney's and
Tiffany.
</P>
<P>
   But driven by the density and entrepreneurial spirit of its
Jewish population, especially over the last few years, Borough Park
has become what the Lower East Side used to be, the place for
Orthodox Jews to shop. On any day but the Sabbath, the mile-long
strip of storefronts is teeming with people in search of everything
from kosher groceries and refined flatware to electronic equipment.
The reason they come, they say, is simple: to get high quality,
great selection and competitive prices.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike the Lower East Side of decades ago, 13th Avenue has
developed a global reach because of the ease of air transportation
and the Internet. Many of the businesses have their own Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   The area has become so bustling that a 52-room kosher hotel
opened three weeks ago on 13th Avenue, the first hotel to rise in
Borough Park in more than a decade and one of the few to be built
in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has become our Manhattan,'' said Max Schwartzberg, who came
to Borough Park from Tel Aviv to shop and conduct business, and was
staying at the hotel. ``I swear, 50 percent of the people on my
flight were coming here to shop.''
</P>
<P>
   Schwartzberg represents only one strand of a diverse and
far-flung clientele that can be found walking in and out of the
stores. The shoppers may be Hasidim: Bobovers, Satmars, Viznitzers
or members of smaller sects in New York. Or they may be modern
Orthodox, coming from Belgium, France, Israel, South America or
anywhere in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The neighborhood itself, which began attracting Jewish
immigrants around 1900, now holds the largest concentration of Jews
in the country and has become one of the world's most Orthodox.
Much of the commercial growth has been created by members of a
younger generation who prefer to do business with other Jews. Many
have become entrepreneurs, according to Egon Mayer, the director of
the Center for Jewish Studies at the City University of New York
and the author of a book about Borough Park called ``From Suburb to
Shtetl'' (Temple University Press, 1979).
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an ethnic village that has been able to broadcast its
wares,'' Mayer said, ``a community that was historically much more
insular but is now being able to make its presence known through
the world.''
</P>
<P>
   In doing so, it has also become one of the richest Jewish
communities, drawing many banking concerns. Charles J. Hamm,
chairman, president and chief executive of the 45-branch
Independence Community Bank, said he opened the bank's first branch
on 16th Avenue 10 years ago and then opened another on 13th Avenue
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went from zero deposits to more than $350 million in these
two branches,'' he said, adding that the average branch has around
$110 million in deposits. ``It's just a hotbed of merchants and one
of the most vital economic locations in the United States.''
</P>

<P>

</P>
<P>
   Most days, shoppers cram the sidewalks, and cars back up for
blocks as everyone converges on the busy thoroughfare. At the many
groceries and bakeries that dot the avenue, a dozen kinds of
gefilte fish and rugelach line the shelves, while every form and
size of modest clothing _ from felt bend-up hats to the long black
coats called kapotes _ can be found at haberdasheries and tailor
shops. Silver shops line the avenue, catering to every conceivable
religious and social occasion, while some of the country's largest
selections of Jewish books, records and videos can be found _ or,
increasingly, ordered over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``In places like London or Paris, you don't have the
concentration that warrants this diverse array of specialty goods:
I mean, where can you get a fur streimel?'' asked Mayer, speaking
of the beaver-wrapped hats popular among some Hasidim. ``I wouldn't
believe it if I hadn't seen it with my own eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayer can point to his own cousin in Sao Paulo, Brazil, who said
he came to Borough Park five to six times a year to stock up on
kosher food and other Jewish goods.
</P>
<P>
   That cousin, Sandor Friedlander, said in a telephone interview
that he could not find many kosher items in Brazil, adding that he
tended to keep a low profile about his trips so that neighbors
would not pester him to bring back items for them, too. ``I have
enough orders for my own family,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not only out-of-towners who are attracted to the
variety offered in Borough Park. ``I came from Flatbush to buy my
granddaughter an engagement gift,'' said Eva Fertszfeld as she
shopped in one silver store. ``You just can't find this selection
and price anywhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Lower East Side's commerce has ceased to be Jewish
except for a few bakeries and stores, Borough Park's wares continue
to expand.
</P>
<P>
   Doron Food Corp., which makes a kosher frozen pizza that is
shipped around the country and to Canada, is moving its
5,000-pizzas-a-week operation from lower Manhattan to Borough Park.
The move was partly to get more space and partly for the name
recognition the Brooklyn area had around the world for fine kosher
products, said Ari Fishbaum, who owns the business with his
brother, Eddie.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, several local developers opened Avenue Plaza Hotel,
an eight-story kosher hotel on 13th Avenue and 46th Street. After
three weeks in operation, half its 52 rooms are occupied. And it is
booked solid from the end of this month through mid-November, said
Nathan Tessler, the general manager, even though its rates _ from
$150 to $450 a night _ rival those of many hotels in Manhattan. He
said the owners were considering doubling its size within two
years.
</P>
<P>
   The hotel offers many things those Manhattan hotels lack,
including a kosher kitchen and a mezuzah outside each door. During
the Sabbath, when it is forbidden for Jews to labor, an elevator
automatically stops on every floor so that no button has to be
pushed, and a hotel staff member can be called to turn lights on
and off for guests.
</P>
<P>
   Mosha Reich, a real estate developer from Tel Aviv, heard about
the hotel from friends before his latest trip to New York and
quickly booked a room. ``I used to stay in Manhattan, but there I
can only find a couple of places to pray, so every day it is a
problem,'' he said. ``Here everything is nearby. I don't think I
would ever go back'' to Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Such sentiments have fed the growth of local businesses, many of
which have tailored their appeal to overseas customers. Eagle
Electronics, which has an international mail order and Internet
business from its 13th Avenue store, does a brisk trade in the
220-volt appliances used overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Eichlers, one of the largest sellers of Jewish books in the
world, sits across the avenue at 50th Street and last year doubled
its size. About 30 percent of the store's business comes from
out-of-state customers, while the 8-month-old Internet site _ which
also draws from two smaller satellite stores in Manhattan and
Flatbush _ accounts for nearly 15 percent of all mail-order sales,
said Moish Perl, a manager.
</P>
<P>
   Notis, from California, spent two nights in the Avenue Plaza
Hotel and hours buzzing in and out of stores. Just before he had to
leave for his flight home, he finally found a birthday present for
his wife: a cherry wood jewelry box.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just a day at the mall,'' he said, looking at the box before
readying for his flight. ``Now I'll have to come back and buy some
jewelry to fill it up.''

   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone _ After the rebels had fled into the
surrounding hills, Lamine Jusu Jarka was carried to the main
hospital here one morning in January. A young man named Mr. Junior,
wearing a shirt that declared ``C.O. Cut Hands,'' had chopped off
his arms with an ax.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt as if I am finishing the world,'' Jarka recounted from
the hospital floor where he lay at the time, surrounded by the
legless and armless, as his niece fed him biscuits to stop him from
slipping into unconsciousness.
</P>
<P>
   Half a year later, as a fragile peace agreement has stayed the
fighting in one of Africa's cruelest wars, Jarka is still alive. He
lives with his family in a makeshift camp for amputees here in the
capital, along with hundreds of other men, women and children who
are missing a leg, an arm and sometimes, like Jarka, both arms.
</P>
<P>
   The residents of this camp lost their arms and feet to a rebel
force that spread terror among Sierra Leoneans not by killing but
by leaving people like Jarka as living, limbless symbols of its
savage power. The campaign worked.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the government of President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah and
the Revolutionary United Front rebels signed a peace agreement that
many regard as a surrender by a government that has no army of its
own and that has been cut off from most of the country's diamond
mines. These have bought the rebels a seemingly endless supply of
arms and ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   But in the eastern stretches of Freetown, where whole
neighborhoods were destroyed or burned down in the rebel assault
last January, and even here in the so-called Amputee and War
Wounded Camp, almost everyone described a universal weariness of
war and seemed resigned to supporting the accord.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is no peace,'' said Jarka, 46, ``everybody will be
killed or everybody will be amputated.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I did not annoy them,'' he said of the rebels, not angrily,
but matter-of-factly. ``I am not a politician. I have no power of
taking the power from Tejan Kabbah and giving it to them. There's
nothing that I could say. I have no voice, you see. I am just an
ordinary citizen.''
</P>
<P>
   No one knows how many ordinary citizens have been mutilated in
Sierra Leone's eight-year civil war, because Sierra Leone has
essentially ceased functioning as a state and, despite the accord,
at least half its territory remains effectively under rebel
control.
</P>
<P>
   Though the number of the maimed may never be known, the
government has said it will conduct a census of the amputees, and
the peace deal calls for the creation of a truth and reconciliation
panel.
</P>
<P>
   Widespread reports of mutilations in rebel-held areas began
surfacing two years ago. Then in January, after nearly capturing
Freetown, the rebels were pushed out of the city by Nigerian-led
peacekeeping forces, though not before killing thousands and
mutilating hundreds.
</P>
<P>
   Most international relief officials and amputation experts do
not expect the numbers to approach the level found in Angola _ or
in Cambodia, with the highest per capita amputee rate in the world,
one in 250. But what makes Sierra Leone unique, they say, is that
people elsewhere have usually lost limbs to mines; here, the limbs
were hacked off by human beings with an ax or machete.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, the amputees elsewhere have typically lost a leg
or sometimes two legs, which though horrible still allows the
victim to function with crutches or a wheelchair. In Sierra Leone,
most amputees have lost an arm, and many are what technicians call
``double upper-limb amputees.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexis Randin, a prosthetics specialist for Handicap
International, a private French organization that has set up an
office in the camp, said he had never seen a double-arm amputee
until he came here. ``It was shocking,'' he said. ``I don't think
you will find double amputees of the upper limbs anywhere else in
the world _ maybe isolated cases, but not like in Sierra Leone.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Amputee and War Wounded Camp, which is run by another aid
group, Doctors Without Borders, 28 of 146 amputees have no arms,
said Wahab Shaw, the camp's manager. Ninety-seven lost one arm;
twenty-one, a leg. About 160 other people with severe injuries to
their limbs are also here, living with relatives in tarpaulin tents
set up on a soccer field and on the flank of a hill that,
incongruously, is in Freetown's palm-dotted resort area.
</P>
<P>
   In the camp's macabre hierarchy of suffering, the double
amputees are considered the unluckiest. Those without arms, like
Jarka, openly express envy of those with a missing leg, who will
one day wear trousers over an artificial leg, or those wih at
least one good arm.

<P>
   Jarka, the father of six children, lost his arms when rebels
invaded his neighborhood in eastern Freetown. Maybe because he once
worked as a security guard at Barclays Bank, Jarka vividly
remembers dates, faces and events. He recognized a foreign reporter
who interviewed him as he lay on the hospital floor last January,
even though he was incapable of spelling his own name correctly at
the time.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels forced Jarka and his neighbors under a mangrove tree,
where the ax-wielding Junior made them rest their arms on a flat
root. ``Then I was amputated and the man told me to go to Tejan
Kabbah,'' Jarka recalled, mentioning the name of the president who
was elected to office in 1996. ``These hands I used to vote for
Tejan Kabbah. So I will never vote for him, no more again.''
</P>
<P>
   A couple of weeks after he was admitted to the hospital,
surgeons from Doctors Without Borders cleanly cut the remaining
stumps, leaving some inches below each elbow. At the camp he now
attends rehabilitation at Handicap International several times a
week, learning how to use a hook that he can operate with a cord
around his shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Once the patriarch of an extended family, Jarka used to bring
home a 110-pound bag of rice on the last day of each month, taking
care of his and his wife's relatives. Today he is completely
dependent on his wife, Mariama Jusu Jarka, 30 _ a sudden reversal
of roles for a woman he had married when she was 14.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to run everything,'' he said. ``I would come and tell
her: `I have gone to your father, I have gone to your mother. Your
father extends his greetings.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``But now I am like a baby,'' he said. ``There's nothing being
done with me now if she cannot contribute. For instance, in terms
of eating, in terms of wearing clothes, even in terms of when I am
lying down at night, she has to cover me up.''
</P>
<P>
   His wife, who has set up a stand selling candy and cigarettes in
front of their tent, remained silent. ``When I think too much,''
she said, ``I feel pain in my heart. I feel headache.''
</P>
<P>
   Valerie Cresson, a psychologist at Handicap International who
treats the amputees, said the Revolutionary United Front appeared
to have selected men whose maiming would most profoundly affect the
social order. ``It was the goal of the rebels to take away their
role as men, fathers and husbands,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In a guest house a mile or two from the camp, Solomon Rogers,
who was leading a delegation from the rebel group on a visit to
Freetown, dismissed the accusations. Stating the official line
established by the rebel leader, Foday Sankoh, at the peace talks,
Rogers said, ``We don't say we haven't committed atrocities, but
the level that has been assigned to us _ we don't agree.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal made Sankoh chairman of a new commission of the
country's mineral resources, and it gave four top Cabinet positions
to his commanders. The accord was criticized by the U.N. human
rights commissioner and other human rights organizations for
granting blanket amnesty to those guilty of atrocities and war
crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of Sankoh, Jarka said: ``He has created all these
problems. He was the person who went to Liberia and organized these
boys, went to Libya to undergo so many processes in order to come
and destabilize this country. Today he wants to come and rule this
country. Let him come and see some of us.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. _ Long before he became Governor of New
Mexico, Gary E. Johnson was an athlete. Almost every morning at 5,
he takes off on a long run, a swim or a bicycle ride, training for
a marathon or a triathlon. As governor, he has ridden his bike five
times across the state, run 25 miles in Army gear and jumped off a
10,000-foot-high mountain on a hang-glider.
</P>
<P>
   Those activities alone might make him unique among the 50
governors.
</P>
<P>
   But Johnson, 46, a second-term Republican, is also unusual in
another respect.
</P>
<P>
   He unflinchingly admits he used marijuana and cocaine in college
and now wants the nation to consider alternatives to the so-called
war on drugs, which he contends is failing through an overemphasis
on prosecution and incarceration. He goes so far as to suggest that
the federal government should consider the decriminalization of
drugs, or perhaps even legalization, which would mean they could be
sold for profit.
</P>
<P>
   And he contends that the costly campaign against drugs has left
courts and prisons overwhelmed with people arrested for possessing
only small amounts of drugs. Drugs, he says, could be regulated
like alcohol and people could be held accountable for what they did
under their influence.
</P>
<P>
   These ideas make him the highest ranking elected official in the
United States to offer what are considered wildly unpopular
alternatives to current drug policies. But they come at a time when
questions of past drug use have become commonplace for aspiring and
sitting presidents. Just last week, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas,
the Republican front-runner in the 2000 presidential race,
reluctantly answered questions about drug use in his past, saying
he could have passed the challenge of an FBI background check in
his father's presidency. And while President Clinton has admitted
he once tried marijuana, he said he did not inhale.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, a former businessman who considers himself as much a
libertarian as a Republican, said he regarded politicians as
``disingenuous'' if they tried to hide what the public had a right
to know.
</P>
<P>
   ``I smoked marijuana in college; that was something I did,'' he
said last week in an interview at the Capitol in Santa Fe. ``I used
cocaine on a couple of occasions. It was not something that anybody
would have ever known. But I knew if I was going to run for office,
I should 'fess up. And if I didn't win, so be it.''
</P>
<P>
   Residents of New Mexico have long accepted their governor's
past, which he revealed in his first campaign. He won re-election
in 1998 with 55 percent of the vote, compared with 50 percent four
years before, when a candidate from the Green Party siphoned votes
from Gov. Bruce King, a Democrat. In winning last year, Johnson
became the first governor of New Mexico to win a second consecutive
four-year term.
</P>
<P>
   But his crusade for alternatives to drug prohibition, which he
began several weeks ago, has drawn wide criticism, even from
leading state Republicans, like Sen. Pete V. Domenici and Rep.
Heather A. Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   They generally disagree with Johnson's contention that the drug
war has failed and cost the nation hundreds of billions of dollars
annually that could otherwise be spent on education and other
necessities.
</P>
<P>
   It is an argument Johnson makes often, traveling in New Mexico
and beyond, emboldened by his promise to seek no other political
office once his term ends in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are spending incredible amounts of our resources on
incarceration, law enforcement and courts,'' he said. ``As an
extension of everything I've done in office, I made a cost-benefit
analysis, and this one really stinks.''
</P>
<P>
   Just how the country might bring drug sales under federal
control or what penalties should apply to drug charges are things
Johnson has not sorted out, he said. Nor would he want anyone to
assume he is advocating drug use. His own use ended after college,
at the University of New Mexico, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to see a discussion on this, A to Z,'' he said.
``The reality of what might evolve is that we get our feet wet, so
that we could learn how to legalize or decriminalize. Politically,
I can't ascertain if there has been a positive or negative
reaction. But publicly, I've found that people overwhelmingly want
to talk about it.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Around New Mexico, Johnson has his allies. The Albuquerque
chapter of the League of Women Voters has expressed interest in
sponsoring a forum on the issue. Jacqueline Cooper, a lawyer who
represents defendants in drug cases through the state public
defender's office, has begun speaking to groups around the state,
promoting lighter prison terms for drug offenders and treatment as
part of their sentences.
</P>
<P>
   The governor has also been invited by the Cato Institute, a
libertarian research organization in Washington, to speak at a
conference in October on alternative drug policies.
</P>
<P>
   But the forces aligned against him are formidable. They include
the White House's Office of National Drug Control Policy, led by
Gen. Barry R. McCaffrey, who recently testified before Congress
that the advocates of drug legalization are promoting drug use
through ``deceptive claims, half-truths and flawed logic to hawk
ill-conceived beliefs.''
</P>
<P>
   Citing statistics that show declines in drug use, drug-related
murders and spending on illegal drugs, McCaffrey insisted that the
drug war was working. He also told Congress that legalization would
cost society even more in medical and prison costs and increase
drug sales rather than slowly decrease them through treatment to
end addiction, as Johnson has suggested.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Weiner, a spokesman for McCaffrey, said the general would
not comment on Johnson's position. Weiner dismissed the governor as
a political oddity, saying he ``is not well advised'' on drug
issues.
</P>
<P>
   In New Mexico, where drug problems are fueled by transit routes
from California, Texas and Mexico, the opposition is fierce. Ms.
Wilson, a freshman representative from Albuquerque who once served
in Johnson's Cabinet as health secretary, said firmly in an
interview, ``This is a subject we disagree on.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Even a national forum on decriminalization sends the wrong
message,'' Ms. Wilson added.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Domenici, Chris Gallegos, said the senator
agreed with Ms. Wilson. ``Proceeding with this sends the wrong
message, especially in a state like New Mexico, which has a very
severe drug problem,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cecil Sena, a police officer in Santa Fe, said alcohol caused
enough problems without adding legalized drugs to the mix. ``We
already have one killer on the streets,'' he said. ``Why put
another out there?''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said he did not expect much support from the
law-enforcement community. Responding to critics like John J.
Kelly, the U. S. attorney for New Mexico, Johnson said they were
``only looking at the crime side of the issue, a knee-jerk
response.''
</P>
<P>
   In large measure, Johnson's tenacity evolves from his lame-duck
status, his lack of interest in seeking another office and, critics
and Republican colleagues agree, a governing style that reflects
less reliance on outside counsel than his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no desire to be a United States senator,'' he said,
alluding to an obvious next step, a challenge to Sen. Jeff
Bingaman, a Democrat whose third term ends next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got the job I've always wanted,'' he added. ``It's a
great opportunity, and I don't want to squander it. My greatest
fear would be to leave office thinking `coulda, shoulda, woulda.' I
just don't want to do that.''

   For at least one person who has seen ``The Blair Witch
Project,'' the surprise hit movie of the summer did not so much
terrify as infuriate. One long slur against witches, said Selena
Fox, a witch, or Wicca, as male and female American witches prefer
to call themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the film had been called `The Blair Cherokee Project,'''
said Ms. Fox, who is part Cherokee, ``people would recognize the
negative stereotypes.''
</P>
<P>
   No one knows how many American Wiccas there are, so how many
have been offended by the fictional story of three student
filmmakers' harrowing encounter with a witch in the Maryland woods
is unclear. Ms. Fox, who helped found one of the oldest Wiccan
nature preserves in the United States, the Circle Sanctuary in Mt.
Horeb, Wis., feels ``certain'' there are at least 250,000 Wiccans
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever their numbers, witches aren't the only people
interested in the occult.
</P>
<P>
   At the movies, ``The Blair Witch Project'' has grossed more than
$100 million _ and since it cost less than half the price of a
Mercedes-Benz to make, it may well become the most profitable film
ever. In the ultimate homage, both ``The Tonight Show With Jay
Leno'' and ``Late Night with Conan O'Brien'' parodied the film and
one of its signature handheld-camera night scenes, complete with
flashlight and close-ups of nostrils.
</P>
<P>
   But the occult craze does not stop there. ``The Sixth Sense,''
about a psychologist counseling a boy who ``sees'' dead people, has
replaced ``Blair Witch'' as No. 1 at the box office. On television,
``Buffy, the Vampire Slayer,'' and ``Sabrina, the Teenage Witch''
reign in teen prime time.
</P>
<P>
   At national bookstore chains and on the Internet, titles about
alchemy, miracles, psychics, tarot, reincarnation and out-of-body
travel fly off the physical and virtual bookshelves.
</P>
<P>
   And most telling, people who call themselves witches get
interviewed by reporters even on days other than Halloween.
</P>
<P>
   Why? A growing number of scholars trace the phenomenon to
feminism, which has made women-led religions like Wicca more open
to public interest and acceptance, and to environmentalism, which
has made regard for Mother Earth a secular, and for some, a sacred
tenet.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, why are a growing number of scholars studying followers
of the occult? Robert S. Ellwood, who wrote ``Religious and
Spiritual Groups in Modern America'' (Prentice-Hall, 1986), a
textbook on alternative religions, said simply, ``Pagans aren't
boring.''
</P>
<P>
   From colonial days, Americans have been fascinated with the
occult, seeing in it both good, evil and the merely utilitarian.
Even at the height of the Salem witch trials in the 1690s, said J.
Gordon Melton, who wrote ``The Encyclopedia of American Religions''
(Gale Research, 1998), few New Englanders thought it odd that the
colonial governor of Connecticut had an alchemy laboratory in his
office.
</P>
<P>
   By the more rational 20th century, however, witches had become
both earthbound and unaccountably sexier, like Veronica Lake in ``I
Married a Witch'' and her later incarnation as Elizabeth Montgomery
on TV's ``Bewitched.'' The picture darkened in the late 1960s, with
films like ``Rosemary's Baby,'' which depicted a young woman
betrayed by a witches' conspiracy. Such films seemed to mirror a
politically chaotic age, especially for the biggest ``minority''
group, women.
</P>
<P>
   Modern feminism, a product of the early 1970s, promised to
empower women, said John K. Simmons, author of the coming ``Beliefs
and Believers,'' which will discuss women-led religions. Before the
women ministers and rabbis of today, the Wiccan movement bestowed
priesthood on both women and men, he said.
</P>
<P>
   And environmentalism, another product of the 1970s, Simmons
said, dovetailed naturally with the occult's emphasis on unseen
forces in the universe that must be brought into harmonious
balance.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In a seeming paradox, many people in the Wiccan movement are
computer professionals, according to Ellwood, a retired religion
professor at the University of Southern California. ``But in a
world increasingly dominated by science and technology,'' he said,
``they want one corner left that is closer to nature and the
nonrational.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the occult cannot seem to shake its guilt by association
with the ultimate nonrational, the devil. ``I don't worship Satan,
who I don't think exists, but I do pray to the goddess of
creation,'' said Margot Adler, a New York correspondent for
National Public Radio and a Wiccan practitioner. ``Wicca is not
anti-Christian or pro-Christian, it's pre-Christian.''
</P>
<P>
   As for magic and spells, said Ms. Adler, whose 1979 book,
``Drawing Down the Moon (Penguin U.S.A.), helped popularize
earth-based religions, ``It's not uggah-buggah, it's attempting to
experience a larger physical reality.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People say `witch' and think `Rosemary's Baby,''' she said.
``But where does that come from? Who writes the history books? The
victors. And paganism lost.''

   Why? A growing number of scholars trace the phenomenon to
feminism, which has made women-led religions like Wicca more open
to public interest and acceptance, and to environmentalism, which
has made regard for Mother Earth a secular, and for some, a sacred
tenet.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, why are a growing number of scholars studying followers
of the occult? Robert S. Ellwood, who wrote ``Religious and
Spiritual Groups in Modern America'' (Prentice-Hall, 1986), a
textbook on alternative religions, said simply, ``Pagans aren't
boring.''
</P>
<P>
   From colonial days, Americans have been fascinated with the
occult, seeing in it both good, evil and the merely utilitarian.
Even at the height of the Salem witch trials in the 1690s, said J.
Gordon Melton, who wrote ``The Encyclopedia of American Religions''
(Gale Research, 1998), few New Englanders thought it odd that the
colonial governor of Connecticut had an alchemy laboratory in his
office.
</P>
<P>
   By the more rational 20th century, however, witches had become
both earthbound and unaccountably sexier, like Veronica Lake in ``I
Married a Witch'' and her later incarnation as Elizabeth Montgomery
on TV's ``Bewitched.'' The picture darkened in the late 1960s, with
films like ``Rosemary's Baby,'' which depicted a young woman
betrayed by a witches' conspiracy. Such films seemed to mirror a
politically chaotic age, especially for the biggest ``minority''
group, women.
</P>
<P>
   Modern feminism, a product of the early 1970s, promised to
empower women, said John K. Simmons, author of the coming ``Beliefs
and Believers,'' which will discuss women-led religions. Before the
women ministers and rabbis of today, the Wiccan movement bestowed
priesthood on both women and men, he said.
</P>
<P>
   And environmentalism, another product of the 1970s, Simmons
said, dovetailed naturally with the occult's emphasis on unseen
forces in the universe that must be brought into harmonious
balance.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In a seeming paradox, many people in the Wiccan movement are
computer professionals, according to Ellwood, a retired religion
professor at the University of Southern California. ``But in a
world increasingly dominated by science and technology,'' he said,
``they want one corner left that is closer to nature and the
nonrational.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the occult cannot seem to shake its guilt by association
with the ultimate nonrational, the devil. ``I don't worship Satan,
who I don't think exists, but I do pray to the goddess of
creation,'' said Margot Adler, a New York correspondent for
National Public Radio and a Wiccan practitioner. ``Wicca is not
anti-Christian or pro-Christian, it's pre-Christian.''
</P>
<P>
   As for magic and spells, said Ms. Adler, whose 1979 book,
``Drawing Down the Moon (Penguin U.S.A.), helped popularize
earth-based religions, ``It's not uggah-buggah, it's attempting to
experience a larger physical reality.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People say `witch' and think `Rosemary's Baby,''' she said.
``But where does that come from? Who writes the history books? The
victors. And paganism lost.''

<P>
   There will be a recession. That is inevitable _ if not this
year, then next year or maybe the year after. The question is, how
severe will it be? The answer is that despite all the fanfare about
these prosperous times, the eight-year expansion walks on
precarious legs, and when it collapses, getting the U.S. economy
back on its feet could be surprisingly hard and painful.
</P>
<P>
   The odds are that the next recession will come sooner rather
than later, and it will be different from other recessions since
World War II. The response will be different, too. Many of the
politicians, executives, financiers and prominent economists who
have bet so heavily on the virtues of a market economy unhindered
by government will probably look this time to government for extra
help in mitigating the damage. Not just in cutting interest rates,
but in stepped-up public spending as well as tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will have to change the rhetoric,'' said Robert Pollin, an
economist at the University of Massachusetts. ``We can still say
that markets play an important role, but they can't cure
themselves. We will have to acknowledge that we need government for
that. It's the stabilizer. And that acknowledgement will open up a
broader debate about what government should do.''
</P>
<P>
   The strengths of this expansion are potentially destructive.
They are chiefly consumer spending and business investment, both of
which are based on debt. Unlike the Reagan-era expansion, which was
driven by government borrowing, the current expansion is fueled by
private-sector debt. Rising stock prices and, more recently, rising
home prices, have encouraged the borrowing. Bubbles have developed
in stock prices and real estate. And when they burst, particularly
in the stock market, much of the collateral for the borrowing will
disappear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know of no time in the post-World War II period in which the
welfare of the American economy, and for that matter the rest of
the world, has hinged so much on the well-being of the American
stock market,'' said Henry Kaufman, the Wall Street economist.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the borrowing has paid for imports, which have given
Americans a great variety of inexpensive goods and services. But
the imports have also created a huge trade deficit that threatens
to weaken the dollar, complicating future efforts to repair a
damaged economy. The June trade deficit, for example, which was
announced on Thursday, was a record $24.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been running the economy on private credit rather than
government debt on a very large and unusual scale,'' said Wynne
Godley, an economist at the Jerome Levy Institute who tracks the
debt numbers.
</P>
<P>
   When hard times come, households and companies will almost
certainly pull back on spending, investing and borrowing _ a
nightmare for an economy that has become increasingly dependent on
such voluntary activity. Government _ mainly federal, but also
state and local _ will suddenly be expected to take up the slack.
As Alan Blinder, a Princeton University economist, put it, ``In the
event of a recession, people turn to government en masse.''
</P>
<P>
   Only this time, the government carries an unusual handicap, as
if it were starting a one-mile race from 100 yards behind the
starting line. It is deficit spending that stimulates an economy,
whether it comes from the private or public sectors. Right now the
private sector carries the load. In the next recession, today's
cherished budget surpluses must be turned into deficits. The public
sector, in effect, must replace at least some of the private
sector's deficit spending.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the proposed tax cuts currently being sold as a
reward for the shrinking government role in a highly successful
market system must be resold to the public in an entirely opposite
manner. They would become the government's way of prodding
Americans to spend more and thus help revive the economy. That was
the justification for tax cuts in the Kennedy, Johnson and Nixon
administrations.
</P>
<P>
   More government spending on housing, public works, education and
income subsidies also seems likely to accompany the next recession,
given the unusual nature of the current expansion and the downturn
it is likely to produce.
</P>
<P>
   This stepped-up government spending would be a departure from
the solution applied to recessions over the last 20 years. These
earlier cycles have been variations on a different theme: The
demand for goods and services outstrips the supply. Prices rise.
The Federal Reserve, concerned about inflation, raises interest
rates to cool the demand. If demand cools too much, unsold
merchandise piles up and, as companies cut back production, a
recession develops. The solution: the Fed cuts interest rates to
revive demand. The Fed, in this way, has played the main government
role in regulating the economy since 1980.
</P>
<P>
   The late 1990s are different. Supply is no longer a problem. The
output of goods and services in this country and abroad outstrips
demand. The economy has been booming since 1995, but inflation is
not a problem with so much supply. The labor force is fully
employed, and in theory at least, labor shortages should be pushing
up wages and prices. But neither is happening noticeably. The
danger is not that demand will outstrip supply, but that demand
will collapse if the stock market does.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve can probably revive demand by lowering
rates, as it has in the past. But here is where the trade deficit
complicates the picture.
</P>
<P>
   Foreigners have been big lenders to America, partly financing
the trade deficit. The percentage of Treasury securities and
corporate securities held by foreigners, for example, has almost
doubled since 1992. When the next recession comes and the dollar
inevitably weakens, the Fed's first instinct will be to lower
rates. But it will also have to contend with the possibility that
the much-needed foreign investors will seek out higher returns
elsewhere in the world.
</P>
<P>
   The way to revive the economy is to lower rates, but the way to
keep foreign lenders on board is to raise rates, or not lower them.
``We could get locked into a situation where we can't lower
rates,'' said Lance Taylor, director of the Center for Economic
Policy Analysis at the New School for Social Research.
</P>
<P>
   Thus the door may reopen to the sort of government intervention
that was commonplace until the 1980s, and that John Maynard Keynes,
the British economist, first spelled out in the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was Nixon who said we are all Keynesians,'' Blinder said.
``It is true now, although many people shun the label.''

FOR VACATIONING CLINTONS, A FLAVOR OF OLD TIMES 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDGARTOWN, Mass. _ A year ago in a sweltering church near here,
President Clinton made a faltering speech about forgiveness and
attracted widespread media attention. Now, the language of forgive
and forget rolls off his tongue in a manner that no longer
surprises and, perhaps more important, no longer carries the
freighted question of whether he will be forgiven.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, are back on
Martha's Vineyard for a vacation. In some ways their summer visits
to this dune-swept Atlantic island _ this is their fifth _ have
become as routine as post-season reruns. Their secluded, borrowed
home at Oyster Pond, the open arms of Vernon Jordan, the
celebrity-studded dinners _ all by now are familiar props in the
summer stock of the Clinton marriage.
</P>
<P>
   But this summer is like no other, and certainly not like the
last. After admitting to the nation a year ago that he had had a
relationship that was ``not appropriate'' with Monica Lewinsky when
she was a White House intern, Clinton seemed iced out of his wife's
personal space. He ruminated on the beach by himself. He dared not
play golf. Democratic support in Congress was draining.
</P>
<P>
   Even the ubiquitous Jordan, the Washington power-broker _ and
one of Clinton's closest friends, who it was suggested had tried to
arrange for Ms. Lewinsky to vanish from Washington and find a job
in New York _ laid low. Uncharacteristically, even Jordan appeared
more hunted than hunting. And an even darker winter for the
Clintons, of impeachment and finally acquittal, would ensue.
</P>
<P>
   But now, it seems, Jordan is back to his jaunty self. And so are
the Clintons.
</P>
<P>
   And so, especially, is Hillary Clinton, who in a year has
transformed her image from wronged wife to wronged-wife-with-a-plan
_ to run for the Senate from New York, with a supportive and
chastened husband.
</P>
<P>
   The president gave his wife's race for the Senate his
full-throated support on Friday night in Nantucket in their first
joint fund-raising appearance for her candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   Before an audience of more than 100 people at the home of Smith
and Elizabeth Bagley, the president went down memory lane as he
sought to capture the essence of his wife.
</P>
<P>
   In an amusing turn, Bagley said that as the husband of a former
administration official (Mrs. Bagley was ambassador to Portugal),
he rarely got to speak and so he wanted to give another muted
spouse the chance to raise his voice. That was his introduction to
Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   In an ode to destiny, Clinton recalled that in 1971, at Yale Law
School, Hillary Rodham had made the first move on him.
</P>
<P>
   ``This woman has initiative,'' Clinton said, explaining that
this was a useful trait as a senator. But shortly after their first
meeting, he said, he had also decided she was ``nothing but
trouble.'' When she confronted him and asked him who he was, he
said, ``I couldn't remember my name.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that he had found Ms. Rodham ``an interesting,
compelling-looking woman, so I followed her out of this class'' and
then ``stalked her around the law school'' for a few weeks. He
decided she was trouble, he told reporters later in the press cabin
of Air Force One (another rare appearance) as he returned to
Martha's Vineyard. He said he had just broken up with another
girlfriend. ``I thought I would fall in love with her,'' he said of
Ms. Rodham. ``And I didn't want to fall in love.''
</P>
<P>
   The rest is history. But there also was a future, as Ms. Rodham
abandoned her career for the Arkansas politician. ``In 1973, after
we had gone together for two years and we were very much in love,''
the president said in a monologue about the relationship, ``I was
very ambivalent about Hillary coming home to Arkansas. I thought
she had such enormous potential for public service.''
</P>
<P>
   She was the ``most gifted person'' he knew, Clinton said, and so
after they moved to the White House in 1993, he told her: ``I want
you to decide where you want to go and what you want to do when we
get out of here. For 20 years, we've gone where I wanted to go and
done what I wanted to do, and I'll give you the next 20 years. And
if I'm still alive after that, we'll fight over the rest.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the tensions in their marriage burst into public view
as the Republican-led Congress sent Clinton to the presidential
gallows for his extramarital affair.
</P>
<P>
   And on last year's so-called vacation, a clearly anxious Chelsea
Clinton seemed intent on gluing her parents together. At the
airport here, she descended from Air Force One just hours after her
father's confession and worked the rope line. This year, as she
reached the final step of the plane ramp, she threw herself into
Jordan's arms.
</P>
<P>
   After all the Clintons had worked the rope line this year, they
stopped long enough to drop their bags at the home of Richard
Friedman, a developer who has lent them his house for the last
three years, before zooming off to Jordan's for a birthday party
for the president (Clinton turned 53 on Thursday). About 40
friends, including Maurice Templesman, the former companion of
Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, author William Styron, investment
banker Steven Rattner and television correspondent Charlayne
Hunter-Gault, came for a home-cooked buffet of seafood paella,
roast beef and birthday cake.
</P>
<P>
   The host, who had skirted reporters during the impeachment
cloud, sent out some white wine to members of the news media who
were stuck outside in the president's waiting motorcade for three
hours. The wine was described as coming from grapes in Jordan's
vineyard. The label, ``Decoy,'' showed a picture of a duck. The
vintage was 1996, a good year for the president.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The president and Mrs. Clinton seem more effusive about each
other than ever. Already, in the opening two days of their two-week
vacation, both are together in public and more visibly upbeat _ and
more laudatory of each other _ than they had appeared in their
entire visit last year.
</P>
<P>
   As Air Force One lifted off on Thursday from Washington toward
this island retreat, Clinton, once morose and distant from
reporters, bounded into the press cabin and asked, ``Hey, guys, are
we going to have a good time?''
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons' language bears the stamp of personal
reconciliation and forgiveness, a chord that Clinton struck
publicly for the first time last year in a church in the Oak Bluffs
section of the Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is important that we are able to forgive those we believe
have wronged us, even as we ask for forgiveness from people we have
wronged,'' he said then. It was the first time Clinton broached the
subject after having appeared less than contrite in an earlier
address to the nation. It was also a chance to test his plea for
redemption among a sympathetic audience, largely of black people,
who remain his most reliable supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm having to become quite an expert in this business of
asking for forgiveness,'' he said then. ``It gets a little easier
the more you do it.''
</P>
<P>
   He has been doing it so much since then that by now it is almost
old hat. He and his wife talk freely about trust and letting go and
moving on.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton, introducing her husband on Friday night at a
fund-raising event for peace in Northern Ireland, told the
audience, ``No one has prayed harder or worked harder than the man
I'm going to introduce.''
</P>
<P>
   She spoke of his commitment to peace, and added, ``We've had
some wonderful times together, and our visits, to Belfast and
Dublin and so many other places where we have been so warmly
received, have only strengthened his commitment, which he intends
to carry out to the very last day he's in office.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton put their relationship in more stark terms still.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, he was talking about the Good Friday peace agreement
and the warring factions in Northern Ireland. But so many of his
comments in the last year have lent themselves to a personal
interpretation, and this was no exception.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some point, they're going to have to figure out a way that
they're both trusting each other at the same time,'' Clinton said
of the Irish leaders, adding, ``You know, it's like two kids
standing on a big, old diving board holding hands and looking down
into a deep pool.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have to do,'' he said, ``is to find ways to help them
let go.''

   NEW DELHI, India _ For the past week, many of India's political
elite have been thinking about that most chilling of subjects: the
hows and whys of building a nuclear arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   Occasioning this reflection was a six-page document titled
``Indian Nuclear Doctrine.'' The paper was prepared by a
government-appointed advisory board, and while it has been labeled
a ``draft'' and lacks the stamp of official policy, it was made
public Tuesday by National Security Advisor Brajesh Mishra. He
assured reporters that the contents should be taken ``very
seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the doctrine echoes what India has been saying for some
time: it has a ``right'' to possess nuclear weapons, but it will
never be the first to use them. It requires an arsenal that
provides ``credible minimum deterrence'' against an enemy's nuclear
attack.
</P>
<P>
   Defining that minimum is the difficult part. So the logic of
deterrence goes: A rival nation must find it ``credible'' that
India can absorb its best shots and still deliver a hefty nuclear
counterpunch.
</P>
<P>
   Some here have suggested that such a minimum of deterrence can
be achieved with an absolute minimum of weaponry. Deterrence, they
say, is a mind game. It can be won without an overwhelming show of
retaliatory might.
</P>
<P>
   The advisory board's doctrine, however, seems to contend
otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   It recommends an arsenal that is able to deliver a nuclear blast
from ``a triad of aircraft, mobile land-based missiles and
sea-based assets,'' one that can respond to an attack ``in the
shortest possible time'' and employs a space-based early warning
system.
</P>
<P>
   To much of the world, it appeared that India was talking itself
into the very thing its leaders said they would never be foolish
enough to allow: a nuclear arms race.
</P>
<P>
   China condemned the document. Pakistan, which 15 months ago
matched India's nuclear tests with its own, said it would soon be
matching its archfoe with a published doctrine of its own. Its
leaders have never placed much confidence in the Indian pledge not
to fire first.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department spokesman, James Rubin, said, ``We think it
would be unwise to move in the direction of developing a nuclear
deterrent and encouraging the other country to develop a nuclear
deterrent and thereby creating an action-reaction cycle that will
increase the risks to both countries.''
</P>
<P>
   For more than a year, State Department officials have been
trying to persuade the Indians in particular to resist escalation.
If the nuclear genie could not be put back in the bottle, it was at
least hoped the genie would not be asked for a triad of wishes:
air, land and sea delivery systems.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, the Indians are tired of such preaching. The
doctrine's preamble describes a hypocritical world ``where nuclear
weapons for a select few are sought to be legitimized for an
indefinite future'' while other nations forgo such defenses.
</P>
<P>
   India believes its security concerns are as justified as anyone
else's _ and perhaps more so. In its 52 years, it has fought one
all-out war with China, which has been taking steps to upgrade its
own nuclear arsenal, and three with Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   Skirmishes with Pakistani forces go on continuously. Recently,
the two nations almost found themselves in War No. 4 in the
mountains of the disputed territory of Kashmir. In that instance,
India was widely praised for showing restraint, but similar
self-discipline seemed lacking on Aug. 10 when an Indian fighter
jet shot down a slow-moving Pakistani reconnaissance plane, killing
all 16 aboard. The Indians said the plane had strayed across the
border, though most of the wreckage landed in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   Both rivals have recently tested intermediate-range missiles.
Presumably, both are busy on the miniaturization required to attach
a nuclear device to a warhead. Last week, scientists from each
nation boasted they had the know-how to build a neutron bomb.
</P>
<P>
   In India, the nuclear document has been met with a hail of
criticism, almost all for its timing rather than its content. The
quasi-official document was distributed by a caretaker government
that in two weeks faces the first round in a staggered series of
elections. ``Nuclear arms are not gifts to be unwrapped by the
electorate at the hustings,'' the Times of India reproached in an
editorial.
</P>
<P>
   That government, a coalition headed by the Bharatiya Janata
Party, has enjoyed a surge in popularity due to the recent
confrontation in Kashmir. Indians are confident they bested the
Pakistanis in that fighting _ and Bharatiya Janata's leader, Prime
Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee, has been given much of the credit.
Defense is a favored issue for the party.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed doctrine places the authority to launch a nuclear
attack in the hands of the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Vajpayee seemed bemused by the fuss the document has
caused. He emphasized that it is only a draft and repeated India's
oft-repeated appeal for the entire world to dispose of the tools of
Armageddon: ``Let all nuclear nations come forward for destruction
of their arsenals and India would take the lead toward making this
world a nuclear-free one.''

SWISS BANKER IN MIDDLE OF RUSSIAN MONEY-LAUNDERING INQUIRY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN with RAYMOND BONNER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   At the intersection of illicit Russian money and the Bank of New
York is Bruce Rappaport, a Swiss banker who has had brushes with
federal investigators in the past and who has long had an important
connection to the bank.
</P>
<P>
   Together with the Bank of New York, Rappaport owns a bank in
Switzerland that helped provide the American bank with important
business contacts in Russia, according to Western bankers familiar
with the operation.
</P>
<P>
   And millions of dollars that were channeled through the Swiss
bank, known as Bank of New York-Inter Maritime, are linked to what
federal investigators describe as possibly one of the biggest
money-laundering schemes in the United States, according to a
person close to the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The Bank of New York, which for years aggressively sought
business in Russia, is currently engulfed in a federal
money-laundering investigation that led to the suspension last week
of two senior officers who oversaw the bank's Russian business.
Federal investigators are also looking into the activities of their
husbands, both of whom are involved in businesses that have ties to
either Rappaport or his Swiss bank.
</P>
<P>
   The money moving through the Bank of New York-Inter Maritime
raises the question of why the Bank of New York, a conservative
institution that is one of the nation's oldest banks, worked
closely with a man who has frequently drawn the attention of
government regulators and law-enforcement officials worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, Rappaport's bank was sued by the Justice
Department in 1997, to recover proceeds that the government
asserted were from drug sales that had been deposited in the Bank
of New York-Inter Maritime on the Caribbean island of Antigua by a
known money-launderer. A federal judge dismissed the case last
year, though, citing lack of jurisdiction. The government is
appealing the decision.
</P>
<P>
   A Boston lawyer representing Bank of New York-Inter Maritime,
William Shaw McDermott, did not respond to requests to interview
Rappaport or to talk about the Justice Department suit. Efforts to
contact Rappaport were unsuccessful. The Bank of New York, which is
cooperating with the federal money-laundering investigation,
declined to comment about Rappaport or to make him available to
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   The interest of investigators is heightened, one official said,
because Rappaport, who is 76 years old and lives in Switzerland,
was recently named Antigua's ambassador to Russia. Antigua, this
official noted, has been a major center of Russian money-laundering
for many years. Rappaport has long had close business, banking and
political ties to Antigua, where the government once granted him a
near-monopoly on the fuel-oil market.
</P>
<P>
   Money-laundering is a legal catch-phrase that refers to the
criminal practice of taking ill-gotten gains and moving them
through a sequence of bank accounts so that they ultimately look
like legitimate profits from legal businesses. The money is then
withdrawn and used for further criminal activity.
</P>
<P>
   Rappaport, who has never been convicted of any wrongdoing, is
well known in Russian banking circles. He helped solicit business
during the boom times in Moscow. In fact, for a brief time in 1994,
Bank of New York Inter-Maritime was used by the Bank of New York to
conduct business in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The world of international banking is often built on personal
relationships. In that world, an ability to deal easily across
borders and within business, political and financial circles is
highly valuable to big banks. To gain access to certain foreign
markets, the Bank of New York has relied on people like Rappaport.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Haifa, now Israel, Rappaport has used his base in Geneva
to pursue investments and business in a wide range of places,
including Oman, Liberia, Nigeria, Haiti, Thailand, Indonesia,
Belgium and the United States. Rappaport opened Inter-Maritime in
Geneva in 1966.
</P>
<P>
   By the 1980s, he was one of the Bank of New York's largest
individual shareholders, controlling millions of dollars in stock
amounting to a nearly 8 percent stake in the company.
</P>
<P>
   Although virtually all of that stock has been sold, back in the
'80s Rappaport's hefty stake gave him entre to the bank's senior
management, including the chief executive at that time, Carter
Bacot. Bacot, whom the Bank of New York declined to make available
for comment, is said by a former Bank of New York senior executive
to have approved the bank's decision to buy a large stake in
Rappaport's bank, known then as Inter Maritime.
</P>
<P>
   By 1992, the Bank of New York reportedly owned about 28 percent
of what became known as Bank of New York-Inter Maritime.
</P>
<P>
   In the federal money-laundering investigation of the bank that
surfaced last week, one of the accounts authorities are looking at
is Benex, which moved funds through the Bank of New York as well as
the Bank of New York-Inter Maritime.
</P>
<P>
   The sole director of Benex Worldwide, a British affiliate,
according to corporate records in London, is Peter Berlin. He is
the Russian-born husband of one of the senior officers at the Bank
of New York, Lucy Edwards, who was suspended last week by the bank.
Ms. Edwards, 41, oversaw Russian accounts in the Bank of New York's
London office. Berlin is believed by American investigators to have
had authority over the Benex account at the Bank of New York.
</P>
<P>
   An initial round of federal subpoenas issued to the Bank of New
York produced 3,500 pages of transactions for one account in
Benex's name, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Edwards reported to Natasha Gurfinkel Kagalovsky, who is
based in New York and supervised all of the bank's Eastern European
business.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kagalovsky, 44, was also suspended because of the
money-laundering investigation, and her office, like Ms. Edwards',
was searched and sealed by law-enforcement officials last week. The
Bank of New York has repeatedly declined to make either of the
women, who have not been accused of any wrongdoing, available for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kagalovsky's husband, Konstantin Kagalovsky, is a former
senior executive at Bank Menatep, one of Russia's largest banks.
And Menatep, according to Western law-enforcement officials, has
also had dealings with Rappaport.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Menatep, now virtually insolvent, is part of an industrial
empire overseen by Mikhail Khodorkovsky, one of Russia's prominent
financiers, or so-called ``oligarchs.'' Bank of New York had an
active relationship with Menatep and helped the bank list its stock
for trading in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Federal investigators are trying to determine whether some of
the money that may have been laundered through the Bank of New York
came from Menatep. Menatep, and related companies in Russia, are
suspected by Western investors and Russian regulatory authorities
of having looted money from the country, assertions that
Khodorkovsky and his representatives have firmly denied.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Khodorkovsky briefly served as a director of the
European Union Bank, an Internet bank based in Antigua.
Khodorkovsky has said that he served as a director of the online
bank for only one week and had no further involvement with it. The
bank later collapsed amid accusations from various regulators that
it was a scam.

   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ Soon after last week's devastating earthquake
in Turkey, telephones at the Turkish Embassy in Athens, Greece,
began ringing. Lines were jammed as ordinary Greeks, many of them
upset and overwrought, called to express sympathy for quake victims
and to ask what they could do to help.
</P>
<P>
   Many lined up to donate blood. Others contributed to a fund
drive organized by the Greek Red Cross or dropped donations at
depots set up by the mayor of Athens.
</P>
<P>
   Greek aid did not come only from individuals and private groups.
Within 12 hours of the quake, the government sent three planeloads
of relief supplies to Turkey, and it continued to send rescue
workers, doctors, field kitchens, medical supplies and firefighting
aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would like to warmly thank those who shared our deep sorrow
and offered to provide assistance,'' the Turkish Embassy responded
in a statement. In both tone and substance, the statement marked an
extraordinary departure from the strident rhetoric that Greece and
Turkey often use when addressing each other in public.
</P>
<P>
   Greece is often described as Turkey's principal rival, and it
has spent much of the last quarter century blocking Turkish
initiatives and ambitions. But last week's remarkable outpouring,
not just of aid but also of sentiment, shows that a deeply felt
sense of shared history and shared fate still binds many Greeks and
Turks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The catastrophe from the earthquake drained us emotionally,''
a Greek government spokesman, Dimitris Reppas, told reporters in
Athens. ``In these situations there is no room for any ulterior
motives. You try to help someone in need, someone who is facing a
difficult situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Greece might have been expected to respond to the earthquake as
did Armenia, another country traditionally unfriendly to Turkey.
There was no special sympathy there, and while President Robert
Kocharian said he was ready to dispatch a planeload of supplies, he
said he would do so only if Turkey asked for Armenian help.
</P>
<P>
   While relations between Turkey and Armenia are all but frozen,
however, a palpable thaw is bringing Greeks and Turks closer
together. Tuesday's earthquake came at a very interesting moment in
Greek-Turkish relations. The heartfelt reaction of many Greeks
reflected a growing desire in both countries to end the bitterness
and hostility that divides two neighbors who have much to gain from
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been taught to hate the Turks for years,'' the
columnist Anna Stergiou wrote in one Athens newspaper. ``But their
unbelievable pain gives us no joy. We were moved, we cried as if
the age-old hatred disappeared at the sight of dead babies.''
</P>
<P>
   This was the second catastrophe that added momentum to efforts
to bring Greece and Turkey together. The war in Kosovo was the
first. As it raged, Greek and Turkish diplomats worked together on
refugee problems and other matters, and seemed to emerge with a
renewed sense that if they join hands, they can have a decisive
effect in shaping events in this region.
</P>
<P>
   ``Naturally there is a simple emotional reason for helping
earthquake victims, but what has happened in the last few days also
has a political importance,'' said Alexis Alexandris, a Greek
diplomat who has written extensively on Greek-Turkish relations.
``In our ministry, and also among our Turkish counterparts, there
is a growing desire to break out of this vicious circle.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an optimism, no doubt,'' Alexandris continued. ``It's
still very guarded and limited, but it's better than confrontation.
What we've seen this week is symptomatic of a more general trend.''
</P>
<P>
   Greece and Turkey remain highly suspicious of each other. Turkey
was outraged by Greek support for the fugitive Kurdish rebel leader
Abdullah Ocalan, who was captured in February while under the
protection of Greek diplomats in Kenya (he has since been tried in
a Turkish court and sentenced to death). Greece worries that Turkey
plots to grab some of its Aegean islands. But at least for the
moment, those disputes have faded into the background.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason may be the character of the countries'
foreign ministers. Ismail Cem of Turkey is a thoughtful former
journalist who disdains rabble-rousing statements. George
Papandreou of Greece, equally earnest and soft-spoken, could hardly
be more different from his predecessor, Theodore Pangalos, who
publicly described Turks as thieves and rapists and who was forced
to resign following the controversy over Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
   Today the two ministers meet almost routinely whenever they find
themselves at the same summits or conferences, a quiet but
remarkable change in relations.
</P>
<P>
   Greeks and Turks lived closely together for centuries during the
Ottoman period. Many Greeks have roots in Turkey, and many Turks
trace their ancestry to Greece and the Balkans. The two peoples are
also emotionally and psychologically similar, a fact that may have
set off last week's outpouring of Greek sympathy and aid for
Turkish earthquake victims.
</P>
<P>
   It would be foolish to understate the obstacles that still
divide Greece and Turkey, including their long bitter conflict over
the island of Cyprus. Nor is it reasonable to expect a sudden
breakthrough in relations between the two countries, which were at
the brink of war over a barren rock in the Aegean as recently as
1996.
</P>
<P>
   But the style of their discourse has changed, and last week's
surge of Greek aid for Turkish earthquake victims suggests that the
people as well as their leaders may finally be ready for serious
efforts to overcome the destructive hostility that has divided them
for decades.

   WASHINGTON _ Gov. George W. Bush is appealingly self-confident.
Or is he arrogant? He is engaging and fun loving. Or is he
immature? He is, refreshingly, an ordinary guy who has not plotted
his whole life to end up in the White House. Or is he too cavalier
about the office? He is decisive and sees the big picture. Or is he
shallow, impulsive and impatient, not willing to sweat the
nitty-gritty of policy?
</P>
<P>
   Months after the Republican establishment placed its bets for
the party's presidential nomination with the governor of Texas, a
reappraisal is under way, fueled by a restless press corps, as well
as by Bush's opponents, freshly determined after his first-place
finish in a straw poll in Iowa a week ago to slow his seemingly
effortless march to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The reassessment was inevitable. Bush catapulted to prominence
so fast (``godlike status,'' in the words of an opposing, and
perhaps envious, strategist) that few people in political circles,
let alone voters, have had a chance to get to know him. But after
the straw poll, Bush is no longer viewed as simply the front-runner
for the Republican nomination. He is viewed as a person who could
be the next president of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Questions about Bush's personal qualities _ to say nothing of
the press fracas last week over whether he had used illegal drugs
in the past _ are not born merely out of gossip or base curiosity
about what the candidate is like deep down or how he behaved as a
young man. A fundamental challenge of presidential candidates _ one
facing Bush now _ is to convince the public that they have the
temperament and maturity to lead the country.
</P>
<P>
   No one's personality can fairly be described in black and white.
Reality is always more shaded. Yes, Bush is self-confident. And
yes, he is probably a touch smug. But the angling has already begun
over who can first define Bush's character for voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush comes across as if he's just amused at the whole process,
laughing out loud at it,'' said Brian Kennedy, the chief strategist
for Lamar Alexander, the former Tennessee governor, who quit the
race last week. ``He has yet to present a presidential persona.''
(Alexander did have such a persona, but that did not seem to be
enough.)
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, a former executive director of the Republican Governors
Association, recalled, ``I first observed it at meetings when other
governors would sit in their chairs and listen to the discussions
about policy. He just had no interest in doing that. He would get
up and slap people on the back, joke around and stay for as little
time as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Bush, 53, conducts himself in ways that are appealing to
some and off-putting to others. He is forever mugging for the
cameras, winking at reporters from the lectern and entertaining
people with his impression of Dr. Evil, the campy villain from
``Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me.'' In his spontaneity, he
sometimes borders on the inappropriate, as when he bounded up to a
graying reporter, smiling, and blurted, ``It's the reporter from
the AARP!''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, Bush seems as bemused as anyone that only five years
ago he had never been elected to anything and now he is the man to
beat. But clearly, he seems certain that he will win. During a
visit to California last month, he described it as ``my first trip
as president of the United States.'' He corrected himself, saying,
``Soon to be president of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   There can be an air of overconfidence in Bush, which may be a
reflection of his early dominance in the race. While his opponents
toiled in Iowa for weeks or months, if not years, before the straw
poll, Bush went on vacation. Unlike his opponents, Bush has not had
to beg for donations _ the checks pour in.
</P>
<P>
   On issues, Bush has given his detractors reason for pause. He
has defended his lack of preparedness in foreign policy experience
by saying he would turn to the best experts for help. His advisers
say he is a quick study who is diligent about learning the issues.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's opponents are ardently trying to fill in the blanks in
the most negative way possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``The swagger has to be reduced to a stride, and the air of
arrogance diminished to an air of confidence,'' said William Dal
Col, the campaign manager for Steve Forbes, who finished second in
the Iowa straw poll. ``And if they're unable to do that, it could
have a fatal effect on his candidacy.''
</P>
<P>
   (Forbes, who has never been elected to anything, is trying so
hard to appear presidential that he has filmed commercials in an
Oval Office-like setting.)
</P>
<P>
   Marilyn Quayle accused Bush of having many of the faults that
she says were unfairly attributed to her husband, former Vice
President Dan Quayle. She told The Arizona Republic recently that
her husband's rival was ``the party frat-boy type.'' She also said
Bush was ``the guy that never accomplished anything, everything he
got Daddy took care of.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Gov. Roy Romer of Colorado, the general chairman of the
Democratic Party, said that if Bush is the nominee, he would look
weak and unprepared compared with Vice President Al Gore or former
Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ``People take this presidency very seriously,'' Romer said.
``There's a flippancy that shows in his demeanor. Maybe it's part
of having the Bush name. Maybe he feels anointed and ready to go.''
</P>
<P>
   The questions about Bush's disposition intensified after an
article in the new magazine Talk. The writer Tucker Carlson quoted
the governor using curse words, boasting that ``I'm not interested
in process,'' and making fun of Karla Faye Tucker, a double
murderer who was executed in Texas last year. Mimicking the woman
when she was asked on television what she would say to Bush if she
could appeal to him for clemency, Carlson wrote, Bush ``whimpers,
his lips pursed in mock desperation: `Please don't kill me.'''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said his comments were misinterpreted. ``I didn't do the
interview for Talk,'' he said, portraying Carlson as ``somebody
coming to get a flavor of the campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gary Bauer, a favorite among religious conservatives, who is
also seeking the Republican nomination, said the governor's
comments in the magazine were ``inappropriate, disgusting and
profoundly disturbing.''
</P>
<P>
   The article prompted George F. Will, the conservative columnist,
to write that Bush was operating in ``an atmosphere of adolescence,
a lack of gravitas _ a carelessness, even a recklessness, perhaps
born of things having gone a bit too easily so far.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Gov. George W. Bush is appealingly self-confident.
Or is he arrogant? He is engaging and fun loving. Or is he
immature? He is, refreshingly, an ordinary guy who has not plotted
his whole life to end up in the White House. Or is he too cavalier
about the office? He is decisive and sees the big picture. Or is he
shallow, impulsive and impatient, not willing to sweat the
nitty-gritty of policy?
</P>
<P>
   Months after the Republican establishment placed its bets for
the party's presidential nomination with the governor of Texas, a
reappraisal is under way, fueled by a restless press corps, as well
as by Bush's opponents, freshly determined after his first-place
finish in a straw poll in Iowa a week ago to slow his seemingly
effortless march to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The reassessment was inevitable. Bush catapulted to prominence
so fast (``godlike status,'' in the words of an opposing, and
perhaps envious, strategist) that few people in political circles,
let alone voters, have had a chance to get to know him. But after
the straw poll, Bush is no longer viewed as simply the front-runner
for the Republican nomination. He is viewed as a person who could
be the next president of the United States.

in the past _ are not born merely out of gossip or base curiosity
about what the candidate is like deep down or how he behaved as a

Reality is always more shaded. Yes, Bush is self-confident. And
yes, he is probably a touch smug. But the angling has already begun
over who can first define Bush's character for voters.

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Last week reporters were consumed with questioning Bush about
rumors that have lingered for years that he used illegal drugs as a
young man, and his careful responses only seemed to escalate the
issue. The Washington Post even called the question Bush's first
crisis. But how relevant will it seem in five months, when voting
in the primaries begins? No evidence has been presented to support
the rumors. Nor have they dissuaded Texans from electing him
governor twice.
</P>
<P>
   This year, his rivals haven't made it an issue. If anything, how
Bush handles the questions now _ like Clinton and his admission
during the 1992 campaign that he tried marijuana in college _ may
impress voters more than what he did or may have done in his youth.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Greenstein, a historian at Princeton, dismissed some of the
scathing judgments of Bush as alarmist, yet inescapable. ``If he
didn't have any of these slight angularities,'' he said, ``then the
question would be: Is he bland and soapy?''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, what his detractors do not seem to like about Bush is
what makes him likable to others.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Bill Clinton or Al Gore, for example, Bush has not
plotted his life to make it to the Oval Office, a fact that makes
him more down-to-earth and less desperate. He is not embarrassed to
say when he does not know something. And while his father, former
President Bush, may have appeared more presidential, he was forever
denounced for not knowing how to connect.
</P>
<P>
   There are signs that Bush is trying to come off as less the frat
boy and more the commander in chief. During an interview recently,
he referred to his best friend and finance chairman, Donald Evans,
as Donny. Then he quickly instructed a reporter to revise it to a
more grown-up sounding Don.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's advisers say he also intends to roll out a series of
policy speeches in the fall _ just as Bill Clinton did, when he was
trying to get people to take him seriously.
</P>
<P>
   The root of the criticism, Evans, the governor's close friend,
said, is that ``we're the front-runner, we're winning, we're
leading, so people are trying to concoct anything they can. It's a
total misrepresentation of the friend I've known for 25 years and
my wife's known for 50 years. They don't understand the heart and
soul and mind of this guy like I do.''
</P>
<P>
   But often the governor cannot help himself. At an event in
Texas, he was horsing around with someone for a photograph and
pointed to the man next to him and said, ``He's the ugly one!''
Then, spotting a reporter looking on, he quickly explained that
they were old buddies who always teased each other.
</P>
<P>
   The governor can take solace in the fact that in 1960 Richard M.
Nixon questioned whether John F. Kennedy was mature enough, and
steeped enough in the issues, to be president. But that future
president happily seized on his youthfulness as an asset. He was
only 43.

 By MATTHEW L. WALD    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Right after ``What does it cost?'' the question
that almost every traveler planning a trip on a foreign airline
asks is ``Is it safe?'' The average ticket buyer can't get an
answer, and even if the Federal Aviation Administration knows, it
is barred by treaty from saying.
</P>
<P>
   But that's all about to change. An agreement between the
airlines and the Pentagon will take advantage of the industry's
growing use of code-sharing _ agreements enabling carriers to sell
tickets on one another's flights. The airlines will report to the
Defense Department on the operations of their code-share partners.
The result will make commercial interests, not governments, the
driving force behind safety measures.
</P>
<P>
   Code-sharing has given airlines a larger stake in one another's
safety. When a Swissair MD-11 crashed off Halifax, Nova Scotia, on
Sept. 2 last year, killing all 229 people aboard, Delta found that
it, not Swissair, was responsible for about two dozen passengers,
because it had sold them tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Then in April a Korean Air Lines cargo plane crashed in China,
killing five. It was KAL's sixth accident in 48 months, and Delta,
its U.S. code-share partner, ended the 4-year-old relationship. The
Defense Department reacted by putting KAL on its ``non-use'' list a
few days later, and halting the purchase of tickets from that
airline.
</P>
<P>
   This month the Defense Department, which buys 200,000 tickets
yearly on foreign airlines, took the process a giant step forward.
It has been looking for ways to judge the safety of all carriers
since 1985, when a chartered plane, an Arrow DC-8 carrying 248
members of the 101st Airborne Division, crashed at Gander Airport
in Newfoundland, and Congress ordered the department to review its
charter operators.
</P>
<P>
   This month it signed an agreement with the six U.S. airlines
that maintain extensive foreign code shares: The airlines promised
to review their foreign partners using a single set of standards
and report back.
</P>
<P>
   When carried out, the compilation, experts say, will be the
first in-depth, systematic evaluation of the performance of foreign
airlines available to the public.
</P>
<P>
   The six U.S. airlines _ American, Continental, Delta, Northwest,
Trans World and United _ have 160 code-share agreements among them,
representing the great majority of the world's airlines. Some have
already conducted evaluations, though not uniformly or rigorously;
now they will all apply the same yardstick.
</P>
<P>
   ``The set of standards is a book 3 or 4 inches thick,'' said
Mary Lou McHugh, assistant deputy undersecretary of defense for
transportation policy, and uniformly applying those standards,
derived from FAA rules, ``has impact for travelers worldwide.'' The
six carriers will review crew training, cockpit procedures,
maintenance systems, procedures for calculating a plane's weight
and fuel requirements, among dozens of other areas.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Transportation Department, which oversees the
FAA, will decide in the next few weeks whether to order the U.S.
carriers to do rigorous audits on the foreign carriers.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, American supervision of those carriers that fly to
the United States is minimal. After another KAL plane, a Boeing
747, crashed on approach to Guam in August 1997, FAA inspectors
testified at an investigative hearing that they do not check
foreign planes except for occasional visits to those visiting U.S.
airports to see if pilots have their licenses with them and if the
airplanes have U.S.-required gear like aisle lighting.
</P>
<P>
   The Department rule could require the six U.S. carriers to turn
over their audit results, which would make them government property
and subject to disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed system will result in a kind of extraterritoriality
for U.S. flight safety rules, extending the FAA's reach to carriers
over which it has little or no control.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At the International Air Transport Association, David O'Connor,
the trade group's regional director for the United States, said
that the idea of code-share partners auditing one another was long
established, but that public release of such information was not.
O'Connor's group was trying to establish an audit system that
airlines would have to apply to join his organization.
</P>
<P>
   Travelers worldwide will reap the benefits. When the Defense
Department places a foreign carrier in ``non-use,'' it notifies the
State Department, which includes the information in its Consular
Information Sheets. Travelers can get them on the Web at
http://travel.state.gov/travel_warnings.html or by automated fax,
at (202) 647-3000 or by telephone at (202) 647-5225. They can also
get it directly from the Pentagon at (703) 697-2788.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. airlines say they are confident of their ability to
advise and evaluate. Clayton Foushee, vice president of flight
operations at Northwest Airlines, compared his company's
inspections of its code-share partners to large-scale ``white
glove'' inspections that the FAA occasionally conducts on U.S.
carriers. Northwest is a partner with KLM, Alitalia and Air China,
which is a mainland Chinese carrier.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are things we can do as one commercial entity to another
commercial entity,'' said Capt. Edmond Soliday, vice president for
safety at United. Advice from a fellow airline can be as useful as
a government regulation, he said, because ``You can't punish your
way into safety.'' His airline code-shares with Lufthansa, SAS,
Thai, Varig, Air New Zealand and All Nippon Airways.
</P>
<P>
   But safety improvements, Soliday said, will continue only as
long as the foreign airline wants them to. ``I can audit till I
turn blue, and I can't guarantee there will be no crashes,'' he
said.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Right after ``What does it cost?'' the question
that almost every traveler planning a trip on a foreign airline
asks is ``Is it safe?'' The average ticket buyer can't get an
answer, and even if the Federal Aviation Administration knows, it
is barred by treaty from saying.
</P>
<P>
   But that's all about to change. An agreement between the
airlines and the Pentagon will take advantage of the industry's
growing use of code-sharing _ agreements enabling carriers to sell
tickets on one another's flights. The airlines will report to the
Defense Department on the operations of their code-share partners.
The result will make commercial interests, not governments, the
driving force behind safety measures.
</P>
<P>
   Code-sharing has given airlines a larger stake in one another's
safety. When a Swissair MD-11 crashed off Halifax, Nova Scotia, on
Sept. 2 last year, killing all 229 people aboard, Delta found that
it, not Swissair, was responsible for about two dozen passengers,
because it had sold them tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Then in April a Korean Air Lines cargo plane crashed in China,
killing five. It was KAL's sixth accident in 48 months, and Delta,
its U.S. code-share partner, ended the 4-year-old relationship. The
Defense Department reacted by putting KAL on its ``non-use'' list a
few days later, and halting the purchase of tickets from that
airline.
</P>
<P>
   This month the Defense Department, which buys 200,000 tickets
yearly on foreign airlines, took the process a giant step forward.
It has been looking for ways to judge the safety of all carriers
since 1985, when a chartered plane, an Arrow DC-8 carrying 248
members of the 101st Airborne Division, crashed at Gander Airport
in Newfoundland, and Congress ordered the department to review its
charter operators.
</P>
<P>
   This month it signed an agreement with the six U.S. airlines
that maintain extensive foreign code shares: The airlines promised
to review their foreign partners using a single set of standards
and report back.
</P>
<P>
   When carried out, the compilation, experts say, will be the
first in-depth, systematic evaluation of the performance of foreign
airlines available to the public.
</P>
<P>
   The six U.S. airlines _ American, Continental, Delta, Northwest,
Trans World and United _ have 160 code-share agreements among them,
representing the great majority of the world's airlines. Some have
already conducted evaluations, though not uniformly or rigorously;
now they will all apply the same yardstick.
</P>
<P>
   ``The set of standards is a book 3 or 4 inches thick,'' said
Mary Lou McHugh, assistant deputy undersecretary of defense for
transportation policy, and uniformly applying those standards,
derived from FAA rules, ``has impact for travelers worldwide.'' The
six carriers will review crew training, cockpit procedures,
maintenance systems, procedures for calculating a plane's weight
and fuel requirements, among dozens of other areas.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Transportation Department, which oversees the
FAA, will decide in the next few weeks whether to order the U.S.
carriers to do rigorous audits on the foreign carriers.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, American supervision of those carriers that fly to
the United States is minimal. After another KAL plane, a Boeing
747, crashed on approach to Guam in August 1997, FAA inspectors
testified at an investigative hearing that they do not check
foreign planes except for occasional visits to those visiting U.S.
airports to see if pilots have their licenses with them and if the
airplanes have U.S.-required gear like aisle lighting.
</P>
<P>
   The Department rule could require the six U.S. carriers to turn
over their audit results, which would make them government property
and subject to disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed system will result in a kind of extraterritoriality
for U.S. flight safety rules, extending the FAA's reach to carriers
over which it has little or no control.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At the International Air Transport Association, David O'Connor,
the trade group's regional director for the United States, said
that the idea of code-share partners auditing one another was long
established, but that public release of such information was not.
O'Connor's group was trying to establish an audit system that
airlines would have to apply to join his organization.
</P>
<P>
   Travelers worldwide will reap the benefits. When the Defense
Department places a foreign carrier in ``non-use,'' it notifies the
State Department, which includes the information in its Consular
Information Sheets. Travelers can get them on the Web at
http://travel.state.gov/travel_warnings.html or by automated fax,
at (202) 647-3000 or by telephone at (202) 647-5225. They can also
get it directly from the Pentagon at (703) 697-2788.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. airlines say they are confident of their ability to
advise and evaluate. Clayton Foushee, vice president of flight
operations at Northwest Airlines, compared his company's
inspections of its code-share partners to large-scale ``white
glove'' inspections that the FAA occasionally conducts on U.S.
carriers. Northwest is a partner with KLM, Alitalia and Air China,
which is a mainland Chinese carrier.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are things we can do as one commercial entity to another
commercial entity,'' said Capt. Edmond Soliday, vice president for
safety at United. Advice from a fellow airline can be as useful as
a government regulation, he said, because ``You can't punish your
way into safety.'' His airline code-shares with Lufthansa, SAS,
Thai, Varig, Air New Zealand and All Nippon Airways.
</P>
<P>
   But safety improvements, Soliday said, will continue only as
long as the foreign airline wants them to. ``I can audit till I
turn blue, and I can't guarantee there will be no crashes,'' he
said.

COMMENTARY: NEAR DEATH EXPERIENCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By BOB HERBERT    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I was in a state of shock,'' said Ellen Reasonover. ``I was
terrified.''
</P>
<P>
   In December 1983 a jury in St. Louis deadlocked over whether to
impose the death sentence on Ms. Reasonover, who had been convicted
of murdering a gas station attendant. It is believed the vote was
11-1 in favor of the death penalty. A unanimous vote was required
for a death sentence to be imposed, so Ms. Reasonover's life was
spared by a frighteningly thin margin.
</P>
<P>
   It's a good thing because we now learn that she wasn't guilty.
And that's the biggest problem with the death penalty. Sometimes
you get the wrong person. One more vote and Ellen Reasonover would
have been shoved unfairly and ignominiously into eternity.
</P>
<P>
   Instead she was sentenced to 50 years in prison without parole,
and she served more than 16 grim years of that sentence before a
federal judge ruled this month that she had been improperly
convicted and ordered her released.
</P>
<P>
   I talked to Ms. Reasonover last week. She was struggling with
some of the technological marvels of the last few years. ``I never
heard of call-waiting,'' she said. ``And I had to learn what a cell
phone is and a pager.''
</P>
<P>
   She was 24 and the mother of a 2-year-old girl when she was
arrested. She's 41 now and her daughter is 18.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think I would be convicted,'' Ms. Reasonover said.
``I thought that when I finally got to trial I was going to explain
to the judge that I was innocent, just tell him everything that had
happened, and then he was going to let me go home.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Reasonover was convicted of murdering James Buckley, a
6-foot-8-inch gas station employee who was severely beaten and shot
seven times with a rifle. Ms. Reasonover became a suspect when,
after viewing a television report about the murder, she voluntarily
contacted the police to offer information that she thought might be
helpful. She said she had stopped by the gas station to get some
change to use at a nearby laundromat.
</P>
<P>
   As her latest lawyer, Cheryl Pilate, put it: ``There was nothing
to tie Ellen to this. She came forward originally as a good citizen
to report a suspicious character she'd seen at the gas station, and
the next thing she knew they had turned her into their suspect.''
</P>
<P>
   The case against Ms. Reasonover was based almost entirely on the
testimony of two jailhouse snitches she encountered after she was
arrested. The snitches, Rose Jolliff and Mary Ellen Lyner, were
both heroin junkies with long arrest records. They hit the
criminal-justice jackpot by testifying that Ms. Reasonover had told
them in a jail cell that she had committed the crime. Jolliff got
cash and Lyner, who admitted she was ``looking for a deal,'' was
spared a lengthy term in the state penitentiary.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first went to prison I was depressed,'' said Ms.
Reasonover. ``I cried a lot and I couldn't sleep. Then I got a job
working at night, cleaning the bathrooms, sweeping and mopping the
floors, pulling the trash. So that was a little better.''
</P>
<P>
   She said guards constantly propositioned her for sex and when
she refused sometimes beat her. Fellow inmates taunted her.
</P>
<P>
   She read whatever she could get her hands on and wrote endless
letters proclaiming her innocence to people she felt might help _
the pope, Nelson Mandela, Presidents Reagan, Bush and Clinton and
their wives. ``I even thought about writing to Chelsea,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Years passed. She contacted the Centurion Ministries, an
organization in Princeton, N.J., that seeks justice for the
innocent, and they eventually took up her cause.
</P>
<P>
   In a decision handed down three weeks ago, U.S. District Judge
Jean Hamilton ruled that the case brought against Ms. Reasonover
was ``fundamentally unfair.'' Two conversations that were secretly
recorded by the police and that were favorable to Ms. Reasonover's
defense were withheld by the prosecution. They came to light at a
federal court hearing just two months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Had those conversations been disclosed, Judge Hamilton said, the
jury ``would have been entitled to find'' that Ms. Reasonover was
``a credible witness whose testimony was corroborated'' by the
tapes.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Reasonover, who is black, said she understands that the lone
holdout against the death sentence was a white woman. ``I always
wondered who that white lady was that didn't vote to put me to
death,'' she said. ``I'd like to meet her so I can thank her.''

   The people who compile dictionaries always have ``news'' (n. pl.
Oxford English Dictionaries' in-house word for new words). But
neologisms are not always newly minted. Take ``yada yada yada,''
which long before ``Seinfeld'' was used by Lenny Bruce.
</P>
<P>
   Jesse Sheidlower, the senior editor in charge of new words at
Random House, became convinced of yada yada yada's staying power
not only by its history, but also by the existence of
well-established parallel expressions (blah blah blah, for
instance). He put it in the 1996 Random House Webster's College
Dictionary.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Agnes, editor in chief of Webster's New World College
Dictionary, excluded yada yada yada from his 1996 edition. And
having tracked a decline in its use, he is glad he did. ``This year
we would have had to take it out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   New words help give each dictionary its personality. The
differences among them may not be readily apparent to the average
reader, but when the editors of four dictionaries provided their
unabridged new word lists for comparison, there was no overlap. One
of the editors, on hearing just six words from the list of a
competitor, was able to guess its identity immediately.
</P>
<P>
   What follows is only a brief sampling of the news. The fourth
edition of Webster's New World College Dictionary, the only one
represented here for which a final count is available, because it
has been published, added 7,000 entries. One of them, Nunavut, just
made the deadline, because the editors had to wait until Canada
officially declared the new territory of Nunavut.
</P>
<P>
   There are always late-breaking news, words waiting to be
accepted. Oxford U.S. Dictionaries, for instance, which publishes
several dictionaries including the Oxford American Dictionary and
Language Guide, has this on its waiting list, pending more
evidence: ``Fuggedaboudit.''

   The people who compile dictionaries always have ``news'' (n. pl.
Oxford English Dictionaries' in-house word for new words). But
neologisms are not always newly minted. Take ``yada yada yada,''
which long before ``Seinfeld'' was used by Lenny Bruce.
</P>
<P>
   Jesse Sheidlower, the senior editor in charge of new words at
Random House, became convinced of yada yada yada's staying power
not only by its history, but also by the existence of
well-established parallel expressions (blah blah blah, for
instance). He put it in the 1996 Random House Webster's College
Dictionary.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Agnes, editor in chief of Webster's New World College
Dictionary, excluded yada yada yada from his 1996 edition. And
having tracked a decline in its use, he is glad he did. ``This year
we would have had to take it out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   New words help give each dictionary its personality. The
differences among them may not be readily apparent to the average
reader, but when the editors of four dictionaries provided their
unabridged new word lists for comparison, there was no overlap. One
of the editors, on hearing just six words from the list of a
competitor, was able to guess its identity immediately.
</P>
<P>
   What follows is only a brief sampling of the news. The fourth
edition of Webster's New World College Dictionary, the only one
represented here for which a final count is available, because it
has been published, added 7,000 entries. One of them, Nunavut, just
made the deadline, because the editors had to wait until Canada
officially declared the new territory of Nunavut.
</P>
<P>
   There are always late-breaking news, words waiting to be
accepted. Oxford U.S. Dictionaries, for instance, which publishes
several dictionaries including the Oxford American Dictionary and
Language Guide, has this on its waiting list, pending more
evidence: ``Fuggedaboudit.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ I get no kick from writing about cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   But the press is not out of bounds here. Whatever W. did in the
past, he has made his own white mischief in the present.
</P>
<P>
   The problem lies in George Bush's packaging of his myth. W.
understands that the arc of a presidential campaign follows the arc
of a heroic adventure. The candidate must slay the dragon or the
giant.
</P>
<P>
   As Joseph Campbell wrote: ``A hero ventures forth from the world
of common day into a region of supernatural wonder; fabulous forces
are there encountered and a decisive victory is won; the hero comes
back from this mysterious adventure with the power to bestow boons
on his fellow man.''
</P>
<P>
   John F. Kennedy, Bob Dole, President Bush and John McCain
offered traditional conquests. They fought real enemies in war.
</P>
<P>
   But boomers like Bill Clinton and George W. Bush who avoided
Vietnam needed to create domestic dragons and internal giants to
kill. Clinton dramatized his teen-age confrontation with his
alcoholic, abusive stepfather.
</P>
<P>
   Yuppie candidates play up painful odysseys of self-discovery.
They slay the Gorgon of addiction and the Hydra of self-indulgence.
They present themselves as redeemed, reborn (or born again) with
the Arthurian virtues _ temperance, loyalty, courage.
</P>
<P>
   W.'s myth (potent because it offers the classic plot line of
succeeding his father as ruler) has been much written about of
late: He was, as his cousin John Ellis said, ``on the road to
nowhere at age 40.'' In 1985, he had a serious talk with Billy
Graham at Kennebunkport. He quit drinking, drifting, smoking and
chewing tobacco and became a disciplined, Bible-reading leader who
``accepted Christ.''
</P>
<P>
   W. is perfectly content when the press hews to this story line:
hothead and goof-off metamorphoses into presidential timber.
</P>
<P>
   He'll talk about overcoming alcohol. He'll talk with pride about
his faithfulness to his wife because it offers a positive contrast
with Bill Clinton. Other ``mistakes'' are declared off limits.
</P>
<P>
   But as in ``Fantasia,'' once the demons are unleashed it's hard
to contain them. When you pick and choose which dragons you've
slain, you shouldn't be surprised when the press won't be spoon fed
from a menu of sins you choose. They'll also be interested in the
ones you want to hide.
</P>
<P>
   And in hiding, W. began to sound too much like the man he
scorns, the president _ parsing, tap-dancing, obscuring, trying to
have it both ways, dribbling out and selectively revealing the
facts.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor's tough talk on crime also left him open. He
signed a punitive law in Texas that allowed judges to put people
convicted of possessing less than one gram of cocaine in jail. He
is also the new standard bearer of a party that has worked hard to
demonize drug users as weak and immoral sinners, best treated from
a jail cell.
</P>
<P>
   His reaction to the kerfuffle shows that he is still green in
many ways. He clumsily reversed his stance of not going beyond
acknowledging youthful ``mistakes,'' boxing himself in by defining
time periods when he did not do illegal drugs. The coyness was
unbearable. First it was seven years, then it was 15 years, then it
was 25 years. He grew ever more ill at ease and peeved.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he got to Fairlawn, Ohio, on Friday he was still
deep in Clintonspeak. ``I think parents, particularly baby-boomer
parents, ought to say to children, `Do not use drugs,' '' Bush
said. ``I think we owe the children that responsibility to share
our wisdom. I worry about a society that sends a different message.
One of the interesting questions facing baby boomers is, `Have we
grown up?'''
</P>
<P>
   He was pressed by The Times' Adam Clymer: ``And if a child asks
a baby-boomer parent, `Well, did you?'''
</P>
<P>
   He replied: ``I think the baby-boomer parent ought to say, `I've
learned from mistakes I may or may not have made. And I'd like to
share some wisdom with you.'''
</P>
<P>
   Mistakes he may or may not have made? There's not a teen-ager in
America who would swallow that. It's not moral instruction. It's
not even wisdom. It's evasion.
</P>
<P>
   Voters might accept a boomer candidate who admitted he dabbled
in drugs. They might welcome a candidate who said firmly and
consistently ``none of your business.'' But they'll never accept a
Bush who sounds like a Clinton.

NEW INDEPENDENT MEXICAN ELECTION COUNCIL VEERS OFF HIGH ROAD 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JULIA PRESTON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ If there is one reason Mexico expects to break
with decades-old tradition and have a clean and fair presidential
election next year, it is that an elections council will oversee
the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago President Ernesto Zedillo, in one of his most
far-reaching reforms, liberated the federal agency that runs
national elections from his direct control and made it independent.
The legislative elections of July 1997, the new organization's
first, were the most democratic and least fraud-tainted Mexico has
had in memory.
</P>
<P>
   But during the last year the sober deliberations of the Federal
Electoral Institute, as it is formally named, gave way to shrill
quarreling among political parties. The disputes, council members
said, have begun to hamper their ability to plan the big election
set for July 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The infighting began late last year when several voting members
tried to get the council to investigate Zedillo's 1994 campaign
finances. They supported a petition by an opposition party,
contending that the campaign had received illegal donations from
Mexican business people.
</P>
<P>
   After a series of shouting matches, the representatives from
Zedillo's Institutional Revolutionary Party walked off the council
in November 1998 in protest. Eventually the council decided it
lacked clear legal authority for the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The council has nine voting members _ academics and elections
experts approved by all 11 parties. Representatives of these
parties can speak during public meetings of the council but have no
vote. The largest, like the governing party, have two
representatives.
</P>
<P>
   When delegates of the governing party returned to the council in
March, they went to its inspector general to complain about four
council members seen as close to the opposition. The party accused
them of violating their impartiality and of misspending council
funds.
</P>
<P>
   One council member, Jesus Cantu Escalante, was accused of
squandering public money on leisure trips to Monterrey and on
highballs served at a conference he organized in 1997. He said that
the council had paid for his travel to his home in Monterrey as
part of his contract and that council financial officials had
approved the budget for the 1997 event.
</P>
<P>
   Early this month the inspector general, Carlos Munoz Villalobos,
fired Cantu, saying he had failed to observe ``austerity'' because
the guests at his conference imbibed an average of 2.2 cocktails a
day.
</P>
<P>
   The move by the inspector general, a governing party member,
awakened the ire of the council president, Jose Woldenberg, who had
remained so impassive throughout the feuding that all sides were
mad at him. He agreed that Munoz had overstepped his authority, and
on Aug. 15 the council voted unanimously to fire him.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition council members believe they are facing a deliberate
drive by the governing party to weaken the council and improve
chances of swaying the elections.
</P>
<P>
   The party ``is trying to undermine us so we will fail to be an
effective force in favor of impartiality in 2000,'' said Emilio
Zebadua, one member who faced accusations. But the party's
delegates countered by saying they were acting to keep the council
honest.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone agrees that the spats have sapped the council's energy
for the huge task of organizing the vote. ``I'm just not sleeping
at night,'' Zebadua said.

WIDE VARIANCE FOUND IN HMO DRUG BENEFITS FOR ELDERLY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ROBIN TONER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ While many Medicare beneficiaries have prescription
drug benefits through health maintenance organizations, a new study
shows that there are wide variations in those benefits and that
some are quite modest.
</P>
<P>
   The study, conducted for the Kaiser Family Foundation, a
nonprofit research group, addresses a core issue in the debate over
Medicare restructuring: Is it really necessary to add a
prescription drug benefit to the Medicare program, as the Clinton
administration is proposing?
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the Clinton plan argue that two-thirds of Medicare
beneficiaries already have coverage for prescription drugs, either
through their HMOs, the purchase of supplemental coverage or
retiree plans provided by their employers. But proponents of the
Clinton plan assert that these sources of private coverage have big
holes.
</P>
<P>
   The Kaiser study looked at the 15 percent of Medicare
beneficiaries who are members of HMOs and found a huge range in
drug benefits. For example, more than one in six were in a plan
with no drug benefits, while one in four was in a plan with
unlimited drug benefits. The rest were in the middle, with about a
third in a plan with annual drug benefit limits of more than
$1,000. The average limit was $1,149.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows the infinite variety of prescription drug benefits
that are offered today by Medicare HMOs, which questions the
general presumption that all beneficiaries in Medicare HMOs have
good coverage for their drugs,'' said Tricia Neuman, director of
the Medicare Policy Project at Kaiser. ``Some do, some have really
great coverage, some have really meager coverage and some have
none.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Jennings, coordinator of health policy at the White House,
said such findings ``generally track with the information we have,
although in the most recent data supplied by Medicare HMOs we find
there's a significant increase in the number of plans capping
benefits at or below $500.'' He added that the administration was
compiling more data on these trends, but suggested that he already
saw evidence that more and more HMOs were putting limits on drug
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Jennings added, ``Really, there's only about 25 percent of the
Medicare population that has a significant drug benefit _ those
people who are fortunate enough to have retiree health plans.'' And
employers are increasingly cutting back that form of coverage as
well, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Pisano, a spokeswoman for the American Association of
Health Plans, the group for the managed care industry, said that
the prescription drug issue needed to be examined in a broader
context, noting that the industry was engaged in a continuing
struggle with the federal government over the adequacy of payments
for Medicare beneficiaries. Health plans are taking a variety of
steps to deal with these cost pressures, including limits on drug
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Still, she argued, ``Prescription drug benefits available
through Medicare HMOs are still the most affordable way, and for
many the only affordable way, to get prescription drug coverage.''
</P>
<P>
   The study raised the complexity of the issue. For example, a
Medicare beneficiary with multiple medical conditions requiring
high prescription drug usage could incur out-of-pocket costs of
$5,358 in a ``least generous'' HMO, and just $1,080 in the ``most
generous,'' the study reported.

   SAN FRANCISCO _ Lindsey Cigarran never thought she would spend
her 20s trapped in a Saab convertible. But the 24-year-old group
manager of Beyond.com's entertainment software division commutes an
average of 2 1/2 hours every day to and from her San Francisco
apartment and an office in Sunnyvale, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a full-on nightmare,'' Ms. Cigarran said recently.
</P>
<P>
   So much so, she rented a room near work where she sleeps when
she is too tired to make the 40-mile drive home. Most of her
driving time is spent talking on her cellular phone with clients.
And she has taken to hoarding secret routes, like an alley behind a
gasoline station near work that is a shortcut to the highway.
</P>
<P>
   For many professionals at dot-com companies in Silicon Valley,
the boom in the Internet has resulted in a commuting bust, forcing
them to funnel onto increasingly congested highways that snake in
and around the crowded Bay Area. From San Francisco to San Jose,
the expanding economy has created a traffic jam of unprecedented
proportions.
</P>
<P>
   Statistics tallied by the Santa Clara Valley Transportation
Authority, a regional management group, show that the percentage of
freeways in the Silicon Valley region receiving the worst possible
congestion rating has tripled in the past four years, to 46
percent. That is akin to hooking up a fast computer with a slow
modem; almost half of all freeway drivers poke along at less than
35 mph.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's gotten pretty bad,'' said Carolyn Gonot, manager of the
authority's congestion management program. She knows firsthand. Ms.
Gonot, who drives to work in Silicon Valley from the East Bay,
acknowledged that she traveled in off-peak hours, saving as many as
10 hours weekly. ``I'm a test case,'' she said. ``We promote flex

   Business leaders in Northern California worry that
traffic-clogged freeways are eroding their wine-sipping,
khaki-wearing, laid-back quality of life that residents have come
to expect, threatening the area with a tied-up traffic fate similar
to that facing their brethren in the Los Angeles basin.
</P>
<P>
   The area is doing its best to cope with the influx of new
people: The San Mateo Bridge, which connects the East Bay with
Silicon Valley, is being expanded to six lanes from four. Several
cities shuttle passengers to commuter train stations, the cost
partly borne by some local companies. And a 1996 half-cent sales
tax will pay for a variety of freeway projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course there will be an impact when a person only has time
to work, drive and sleep,'' said Steve Tedesco, a California native
and president of the San Jose Silicon Valley Chamber of Commerce.
``They don't have time to get involved in their communities. They
can't get home in time for Little League games.''
</P>
<P>
   Congestion is likely to worsen as communities use new-found
riches (also a result of the Internet boom) to fuel a construction
frenzy. A range of projects now on the horizon have several of San
Francisco's leaders predicting traffic catastrophe in the near
future: Caltrans, the state's highway construction division, will
soon embark on a large project that will include demolishing and
rebuilding several blocks of the elevated freeway that feeds into
the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge.
</P>
<P>
   Many believe the project will create long-term chaos in a region
where traffic already creeps for hours on end. The Harrison Street
ramp _ a major downtown exit for morning commute traffic _ is
scheduled to be closed for 4 1/2 years. And several development
projects, including office buildings, hotels and a new ballpark in
the South of Market neighborhood of the city, have led city
officials to forecast the elimination of more than 10,000 parking
spaces, 6,000 of which will be permanent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems you don't have to worry so much about drunk driving
anymore,'' said Gary Skraba, a Los Angeles marketing executive who
travels to the Bay Area several times yearly for business. ``You
have to worry about road rage.''
</P>
<P>
   Doug Wills, a San Francisco native and group manager of
corporate public relations at Cisco Systems, lasted only four
months when he moved back to his hometown last year to be near his
wife's restaurant. Sometimes it took him two hours to drive the 50
miles to Cisco's headquarters in San Jose. His wife, Nasreen, had
it just as bad: It took her 40 minutes to go across town.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't make sense,'' Wills said. ``It shouldn't be this
difficult to get to work.''
</P>
<P>
   So 16 months ago, the couple packed up their furniture and moved
to a house in Silicon Valley. His commute is shorter, and his
wife's 30-mile train trip to her restaurant takes about the same
time as her old 4-mile trip across town.
</P>
<P>
   Some drivers have come up with interesting ways to live in the
fast lane, particularly in the troublesome rush hours. It is common
to see drivers putting on makeup, checking stock quotes on their
laptops, even lifting hand weights.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to figure out how to make those hours productive,''
Ms. Cigarran said. ``There are times when you don't have an extra
five minutes to comb your hair.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   John Marren, an investment banker at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter
who is based in Menlo Park, said he had, on occasion, asked a
junior banker to accompany him to a meeting to take advantage of
the speedier commuter lane.
</P>
<P>
   A number of Silicon Valley's luminaries, including the venture
capitalist John Doerr, now use car services so they can work or
read on their commutes.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate executives who do not want to drive themselves have
their own strategy for coping: high-brow hitchhiking. Every
morning, scores of them, like Francis Torrence, a lawyer at
Seyfarth, Shaw, Fairweather &AMP; Geraldson in San Francisco, line up
near a commuter train station in Oakland to catch a ride.
</P>
<P>
   Passengers mill about until drivers, whom they do not know but
who want to save the $2 San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge toll and
use the commuter lane, pick them up. An unspoken etiquette has
evolved among repeat carpoolers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone says `Good morning,' but usually people don't talk,''
Torrence said. ``Drivers pick the radio station. And generally the
bus terminal is where people bail out.''
</P>
<P>
   For many, the daily Silicon Valley commute is likely to get
worse before it gets better, leaving some to wonder whether the
plugged-in driving lifestyle will end.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're looking up a phone number that's one thing,'' said
Kimball Brown, a computer analyst at Dataquest, a market research
concern at San Jose, ``but if it gets to the point of using a
spreadsheet, I'm sorry, but that's going too far.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cloudy, cool and damp weather will linger Sunday from the east
slopes of the central Appalachians to New England as low pressure
gradually shifts off the Northeast coast. Patchy light rain and
drizzle will occur near the coast where onshore breezes prevail. A
few locally heavy showers accompanied by rumbles of thunder may
develop during the afternoon near the southern New England coast.
Skies will brighten near the Appalachians during the afternoon as
drier air arrives from the Ohio Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Mainly dry and warm conditions will cover most of the
Southeastern states. A few afternoon thunderstorms will erupt
around a dissipating front near the Gulf of Mexico coast. Much of
central and southern Florida will be unsettled with limited
sunshine and frequent thundershowers which will produce locally
heavy rain.
</P>
<P>
   Scattered showers and thunderstorms will accompany a disturbance
as it moves from the northern Rockies to the central Plains. Some
strong thunderstorms with high winds and hail are expected this
afternoon from eastern Colorado and Wyoming to the western Dakotas
and Nebraska. Isolated afternoon thunderstorms will also occur over
the mountains of the interior West. Elsewhere in the West, it will
be sunny and warm.
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane Bret with central winds over 100 mph will move slowly
north parallel to the east coast of northern Mexico. Bands of heavy
showers and gusty winds will reach extreme southern Texas on
Sunday, but hurricane-force winds will remain offshore later in the
day.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Born In Africa
</P>
<P>
   Many of the hurricanes that strike the Caribbean and eastern
United States are born in Africa. In the summer and early fall
dozens of clusters of thunderstorms form in the strongly heated air
near the Sahel. As the clusters move westward, the chilly waters
near the Africa's west coast are inhospitable territory for the
disturbances struggling to strengthen. But, when the high-level
winds are favorable, the African disturbances can reach the warmer
waters to the west where hurricanes take shape. On Friday, Tropical
Storm Cindy sprang to life 300 miles west of the Cape Verde
Islands.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- The law came down hard on Charles Barnes and
Connie Driscoll when the couple ran off and eloped two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   It certainly wasn't that Driscoll and Barnes were too young.
</P>
<P>
   He was 92 and she 84.
</P>
<P>
   But Driscoll suffered from the beginning stages of Alzheimer's
disease, so her conservators had gotten a court order barring
anyone from relocating Barnes' longtime girlfriend without
permission.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the threat of jail and fines wasn't nearly enough to stop
Charles from marrying his friend of 50 years. ``She's my
everything. I love her,'' he said one recent afternoon as she gazed
lovingly at him.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the law is the law, so in October 1997, one month after
the couple exchanged wedding vows, Barnes stood behind his walker
in front of a Glendale Superior Court judge. He faced five days in
jail on a contempt of court charge.
</P>
<P>
   The judge passed on the contempt charge but initiated
proceedings to have the marriage annulled.
</P>
<P>
   Still Charles was determined to look after his ``honey bunch.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A promise is a promise,'' said Charles, now 94.
</P>
<P>
   Now, two years, five attorneys and $100,000 in legal fees later,
the couple is ready to celebrate their nuptials _ they beat the
system.
</P>
<P>
   The annulment was denied in June.
</P>
<P>
   Connie, now 86, got up from her chair and planted a kiss on his
face, bringing a smile to Barnes. ``You're my gorgeous
sweetheart,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The couple held hands on an antique couch in Barnes' English
Tudor-style home while their caregiver, Alma Clarette, ran around
making final arrangements for a two-year wedding anniversary party.
</P>
<P>
   Their love story began 50 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   They were longtime friends, and just before Driscoll's first
husband died in the late 1960s, Barnes promised him he would watch
out for her. Then after Barnes' wife died in 1989, their friendship
blossomed into a romance.
</P>
<P>
   Driscoll began experiencing short term memory loss in 1992. Her
niece, Kathy Foster, who lives in Chico, Calif., placed Driscoll in
a nursing home near her _ 500 miles north of Glendale and away from
her friends, Barnes said.
</P>
<P>
   Foster, who was raised by Driscoll after Foster's mother died,
said she knows her aunt and Barnes have been dating for years. But
she said she wonders why Barnes waited to marry Driscoll until she
suffered from Alzheimer's.
</P>
<P>
   ``If she wanted to marry him, why didn't they get married when
she was lucid? Why did he have to kidnap her?'' said Foster.
</P>
<P>
   The 45-year-old social worker called the marriage and huge legal
fees ``a family tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   Foster said the fees have whittled her aunt's $600,000 estate to
a mere $65,000. A young woman during the depression, Driscoll would
never have allowed money she worked for to be lost to attorneys,
Foster said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was doing great in Northern California. She loved my two
children. She was a second mom to me. Now she wouldn't even know
who I am,'' Foster said, adding she stepped down as Driscoll's
conservator in 1997. A single working mom, Foster could not afford
to fight to get her aunt back to Chico.
</P>
<P>
   A mechanical engineer worth $1 million himself, Barnes said he
had no interest in consuming what was left of Driscoll's dwindling
estate. But he believed she was unhappy in Northern California.
</P>
<P>
   A former beautician, Driscoll always tended to her nails and her
hair. But not in Chico, he said. There she seemed to give up on
life, he said.
</P>
<P>
   So at 92, Barnes pulled off a stealth mission of taking her out
to lunch in Chico and bringing her back to Glendale. The two were
married by Driscoll's longtime preacher, the Rev. Jack Dabner, on
Sept. 9, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The legal battle began in October 1997 when papers were filed in
Los Angeles Superior Court that said Driscoll was incompetent to
marry Barnes.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes' intention, after the 1997 ceremony, was to place
Driscoll in a Glendale nursing home where she could be cared for,
yet close to the people who love her.
</P>
<P>
   That's when Barnes was threatened with jail and $30,000 in court
costs for relocating Connie. Barnes also was ordered to stay away
from her unless granted permission by her conservators.
</P>
<P>
   But Glendale Superior Court Judge Charles Lee dismissed the 1997
annulment proceeding in June.
</P>
<P>
   Having the annulment proceeding dismissed is likely the last
chapter of Barnes' longtime battle to stay with the woman he loves,
and who loves him.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a case of nightmares and miracles,'' said Linda
Paquette, Barnes' attorney through most of his legal wranglings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lost more than a few nights sleep after the police called to
say there was a warrant for Charles' arrest. I was convinced
Charles was going to jail,'' said Paquette.
</P>
<P>
   Instead they will celebrate their union today at a party Dabner
is hosting. He calls the couple's journey ``an old-time love
story.''
</P>
<P>
   On a recent afternoon, Driscoll, wearing the new, bright red
dress bought for today's celebration, fiddled with the butterfly
scarf and wondered when she would get some ice cream.
</P>
<P>
   She craned her neck around the corner, where Barnes readied for
lunch. When asked what she thought about her husband, Driscoll
stared intensely and summed him up in two sentences: ``He's a good
man. He looks out for you.''

<P>
   Since the U.S. Supreme Court reinstated capital punishment in
1976, 566 people have been executed. In that same period, 82
convicts awaiting execution have been exonerated _ a ratio of one
freed for every seven put to death.
</P>
<P>
   About half of them were exonerated in the 1990s, six so far this
year.
</P>
<P>
   In many cases convictions were overturned when newly available
testimony or physical evidence, including DNA testing, cast doubt
on the guilt of the inmates.
</P>
<P>
   Capital punishment is on the books in 38 states, but 36 of them
impose a deadline on evidence presented after conviction.
Virginia's statute of limitations is only 21 days. In 1994 DNA
testing arrived too late to free Earl Washington Jr., whose
sentence was subsequently commuted to life in prison. David
Botkins, the spokesman for Virginia's attorney general, Mark
Earley, says, ``The inmates who have been granted clemency and had
their death sentences commuted show the system works.''
</P>
<P>
   In Illinois, one of the two states without a statute of
limitations (the other is New York), one inmate has been exonerated
for every inmate executed over the last 12 years. Earlier this
month Illinois passed the Capital Crimes Litigation Act, which
increases state funding for defense lawyers, prosecutors and
court-appointed counsel.
</P>
<P>
   In general, executions have been delayed by appeals. About 11
years elapse between conviction and execution, according to the
Justice Department. Last week a conference organized by the 11th
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals met outside Atlanta to discuss how to
expedite capital punishment.
</P>
<P>
   The wrong people have landed on death row for a number of
reasons. Some lawyers are ineffective, or outright incompetent.
Others meet with their clients only hours before going to court.
Prosecutorial missteps, from jury selection to misconduct, have
also been factors. Judges, too, make mistakes, incorrectly ruling
on cases or improperly defining guilt or innocence. When judicial
errors occur, an inmate can be granted a new trial.
</P>
<P>
   Many death row cases attract the attention of lawyers who
volunteer their time to dig up evidence and witnesses. Barry
Scheck, a lawyer who is a DNA expert, helped found the Innocence
Project at Cardozo School of Law at Yeshiva University in New York
City, which has so far helped free several inmates. Students guided
by David Protess, a journalism professor at Northwestern
University, have also uncovered evidence leading to the exoneration
of death row inmates in Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   Since capital punishment was reinstated by the U.S. Supreme
Court in 1976, 566 convicts have been executed. Eighty-two awaiting
execution have been exonerated, about half of them during this
decade. What follows are capsule accounts of death row's living
alumni of the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ERRORS IN COURT
</P>
<P>
   James Albert Robison
</P>
<P>
   Convicted: 1977
</P>
<P>
   Released: 1993
</P>
<P>
   Crime: The contract murder of Don Bolles, a newspaper reporter
who covered organized crime in Arizona. Prosecutors charged that
Robison and another man, John Harvey Adamson, were hired by Max
Dunlap, a land developer, who was also convicted. Adamson was given
a 20-year sentence in exchange for testifying against Robison. But
the state overturned the conviction in 1980 after finding that
defense lawyers had been improperly denied the right to
cross-examine Adamson. Robison was re-indicted for the Bolles
murder. In the 1993 trial, he was acquitted of murdering Bolles,
but later convicted of conspiring to kill Adamson. He is now in the
witness protection program in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Croy
</P>
<P>
   Convicted: 1979
</P>
<P>
   Released: 1990
</P>
<P>
   Crime: The shooting death of a policeman in California. The
state Supreme Court overturned the conviction because of improper
jury instructions made by the judge in his case. Croy was retried
and acquitted after arguing self-defense.
</P>
<P>
   Troy Lee Jones
</P>
<P>
   Convicted: 1982
</P>
<P>
   Released: 1996
</P>
<P>
   Crime: The murder of Carolyn Grayson in California in 1981. At
his original trial, Jones' defense lawyer failed to speak with
possible witnesses, obtain a police report or conduct a pretrial
investigation. The state Supreme Court said the Jones case merited
a new trial, and the prosecution dropped all charges.
</P>
<P>
   Roberto Miranda
</P>
<P>
   Convicted: 1982
</P>
<P>
   Released: 1996
</P>
<P>
   Crime: The stabbing death of Manuel Rodriguez Torres in Nevada
in 1981. Miranda, a Cuban, was offered a much milder sentence in
exchange for a guilty plea, but refused it, insisting on his
innocence and claiming that a man he knew had framed him. At trial
he was represented by a lawyer with less than one year of
experience. Overturning the conviction, the judge wrote that the
lack of pretrial preparation by trial counsel ... cannot be
justified.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Smith
</P>
<P>
   Convicted: 1983
</P>
<P>
   Released: 1991
</P>
<P>
   Crime: Murdering a woman during a robbery in Indiana. A
companion, who claimed to be the getaway driver, testified against
Smith in exchange for the dropping of all charges against him. The
state Supreme Court overturned the conviction, citing ineffective
counsel. Later evidence contradicted the companion's testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Dale Johnston
</P>
<P>
   Convicted: 1984
</P>
<P>
   Released: 1990
</P>
<P>
   Crime: Murdering his stepdaughter and her boyfriend in Ohio,
allegedly to keep them from blackmailing him with accusations of
incest. The court of appeals later ruled that statements by
Johnston used in the first trial could not be introduced at a
retrial because they were taken while he was under hypnosis.

   Crime: The contract murder of Don Bolles, a newspaper reporter
who covered organized crime in Arizona. Prosecutors charged that
Robison and another man, John Harvey Adamson, were hired by Max
Dunlap, a land developer, who was also convicted. Adamson was given
a 20-year sentence in exchange for testifying against Robison. But
the state overturned the conviction in 1980 after finding that
defense lawyers had been improperly denied the right to
cross-examine Adamson. Robison was re-indicted for the Bolles
murder. In the 1993 trial, he was acquitted of murdering Bolles,
but later convicted of conspiring to kill Adamson. He is now in the
witness protection program in Arizona.

<P>
   Convicted: 1979
</P>
<P>
   Released: 1990
</P>
<P>
   Crime: The shooting death of a policeman in California. The
state Supreme Court overturned the conviction because of improper
jury instructions made by the judge in his case. Croy was retried
and acquitted after arguing self-defense.

   Troy Lee Jones
</P>
<P>
   Convicted: 1982
</P>
<P>
   Released: 1996
</P>
<P>
   Crime: The murder of Carolyn Grayson in California in 1981. At
his original trial, Jones' defense lawyer failed to speak with
possible witnesses, obtain a police report or conduct a pretrial
investigation. The state Supreme Court said the Jones case merited
a new trial, and the prosecution dropped all charges.

   Roberto Miranda
</P>
<P>
   Convicted: 1982
</P>
<P>
   Released: 1996
</P>
<P>
   Crime: The stabbing death of Manuel Rodriguez Torres in Nevada
in 1981. Miranda, a Cuban, was offered a much milder sentence in
exchange for a guilty plea, but refused it, insisting on his
innocence and claiming that a man he knew had framed him. At trial
he was represented by a lawyer with less than one year of
experience. Overturning the conviction, the judge wrote that the
lack of pretrial preparation by trial counsel ... cannot be
justified.

<P>
   Convicted: 1983

</P>
<P>
   Crime: Murdering a woman during a robbery in Indiana. A
companion, who claimed to be the getaway driver, testified against
Smith in exchange for the dropping of all charges against him. The
state Supreme Court overturned the conviction, citing ineffective
counsel. Later evidence contradicted the companion's testimony.

   Dale Johnston
</P>
<P>
   Convicted: 1984
</P>
<P>
   Released: 1990
</P>
<P>
   Crime: Murdering his stepdaughter and her boyfriend in Ohio,
allegedly to keep them from blackmailing him with accusations of
incest. The court of appeals later ruled that statements by
Johnston used in the first trial could not be introduced at a
retrial because they were taken while he was under hypnosis.

</P>
<P>
   Crime: The murder of a man during a burglary in Texas in 1983.
Macias' co-worker, who received immunity for testifying, said he
drove him to the crime scene the night of the murder; a prison
informant also said he heard Macias confess. In 1988, pro bono
lawyers revealed evidence of inadequate trial counsel: Two alibi
witnesses had never been called to testify, an eyewitness had not
been cross-examined and a 9-year-old girl's testimony proved to be
false.

   Crime: The murder of Jimmy Lee Turner, an auto mechanic in
Washington state. Harris' lawyer consulted with him less than two
hours and interviewed only three of 32 potential witnesses. After
two unsuccessful appeals, Harris' conviction was overturned in 1994
because of inadequate counsel. The prosecution declined to retry
Harris, instead saying that he was mentally ill and requesting that
he be committed to a state hospital. On the condition that he

   Crime: Killing his estranged wife in her sleep in Oklahoma. An
expert testified that Wilhoit's teeth matched bite marks on the
body. The state appeals court later said that Wilhoit's counsel had
failed to challenge that testimony, and was ``suffering from
alcohol dependence and abuse and brain damage during his
representation of appellant.'' At trial in 1993, after 11 experts
testified that the bite marks did not match, Wilhoit was acquitted.

robbery in Louisiana. Cousin, who was 16, said he was at a
basketball game, and his coach testified that he was at the game.
But his court-appointed lawyer advised him to plead guilty to four
unrelated counts of armed robbery to gain the jury's sympathy.
Cousin was convicted of first-degree murder and the four robberies.
The state Supreme Court overturned the murder conviction because of
improper evidence, but he is still imprisoned for the other

McMillian was placed in a death row cell before his trial even

<P>
   Crime: The murder of William Dulan, an 88-year-old man, in

   Crime: The murder of his parents in Illinois. At his arrest
Gauger was interrogated for more than 16 hours without a lawyer.
Asked to describe how he might have committed the murders, Gauger
complied; his answer was construed as a confession. The same judge
who sentenced him to death later overturned the conviction, finding
little evidence to arrest Gauger in the first place. Last year, a
gang member, on trial for several unrelated crimes, confessed to
murdering Gauger's parents, with an accomplice.

   Gary Nelson
</P>
<P>
   Convicted: 1980
</P>
<P>
   Released: 1991
</P>
<P>
   Crime: The rape and murder of a 6-year-old girl in Georgia. The
prosecution presented an 8-year-old eyewitness and hair and semen
samples. A volunteer group of lawyers later uncovered large amounts
of suppressed evidence, including FBI tests showing that the
samples belonged to a white man. (Nelson is black.)

</P>
<P>
   Convicted: 1984
</P>
<P>
   Released: 1998
</P>
<P>
   Crime: The murder of Dolores Dye during a car theft in
Louisiana. The U.S. Supreme Court, which overturned Kyles'
conviction, ruled that the prosecution had withheld material
evidence regarding a paid informant who said Kyles, an
acquaintance, was the murderer. The informant had previously been
suspected of the murder.

   Adolph Munson
</P>
<P>
   Convicted: 1985

<P>
   Released: 1995
</P>
<P>
   Crime: The kidnapping and murder of a store clerk in Oklahoma
while Munson was on work release after serving time for a 1964
murder. After nine years of appeals and an investigative report by
the American Bar Association, the state's highest criminal appeals
court overturned his conviction, finding that Oklahoma prosecutors
had suppressed evidence that supported Munson's innocence,
including the testimony of eyewitnesses who claimed the murderer
was white. (Munson is black.) He was acquitted in retrial.

   Jay C. Smith
</P>
<P>
   Convicted: 1986
</P>
<P>
   Released: 1992
</P>
<P>
   Crime: The 1979 murder of a teacher and her two children in
Pennsylvania; the prosecution charged that Smith, a principal,
acted with the victim's fiance, who was later sentenced to three
life terms. In 1989, the conviction was reversed because of hearsay
evidence and because the prosecution was found to have suppressed
evidence that strongly implicated the fiance as the lone murderer.
The Pennsylvania Supreme Court wrote that the prosecution had
violated all principles of justice and fairness.

</P>
<P>
   Convicted: 1988
</P>
<P>
   Released: 1991
</P>
<P>
   Crime: Murdering a woman friend in 1978 in Florida. The document
stating his whereabouts at the time of the crime had been
misplaced; the police claimed to have an eyewitness who placed
Scott at the crime scene. The Florida Supreme Court later ruled the
evidence to be insufficient.

   Convicted: 1990
</P>

<P>
   Crime: Killing her 9-month-old son, Walter, in Mississippi.
Butler said the baby stopped breathing and she tried to resuscitate
him before taking him to a hospital. She was later acquitted when a
neighbor, who did not testify at the original trial, substantiated
her story. Tests on the child's exhumed body pointed to kidney
disease as a cause of death.

   Andrew Golden
</P>
<P>
   Convicted: 1991
</P>
<P>
   Released: 1994
</P>
<P>
   Crime: Drowning his wife in Florida. Though the death was
initially ruled accidental, Golden was later tried and found
guilty. On appeal, the Florida Supreme Court said the state failed
to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Mrs. Golden's death
resulted from the criminal agency of another person rather than by
accident.

   Randall Padgett
</P>
<P>
   Convicted: 1992
</P>
<P>
   Released: 1997
</P>
<P>
   Crime: The stabbing death of his estranged wife in Alabama. His
conviction was based almost entirely on blood samples left at the
scene, which were tested for DNA. It was later discovered that the
FBI crime lab had determined that the blood was not Padgett's, but
Alabama prosecutors had suppressed that fact. Padgett was acquitted
at a retrial.

<P>
   Crime: The 1983 rape and murder of 10-year-old Jeanine Nicarico
in Illinois. The men, who knew one another, were jointly tried,
convicted and sentenced to death. They won a new trial after the
state Supreme Court ruled that they should have been tried
separately. After the second trial they were convicted again, with
Hernandez getting 80 years. DNA tests in 1994 implicated a
convicted sex offender, Brian Dugan, who, during a plea bargain,
confessed to six murders, including Jeanine Nicarico's.

<P>
   Crime: The 1984 rape and murder of 9-year-old girl in Maryland.
Bloodsworth resembled the composite sketch of the suspect; police
said he gave information about the crime. The first conviction was
reversed because the prosecution withheld psychiatric evidence, but
he was convicted again in 1986, all the while pleading his
innocence. ``If I'm dead, that's it,'' he told the judge at that
time. ``You can't bring me back.'' In 1993 DNA from the scene was
found not to match Bloodsworth's.

   Crime: The 1978 abduction, torture and murder of a couple in a
suburb of Chicago. The case against them and two others relied
heavily on eyewitness testimony by one witness, Paula Gray, who
changed her testimony several times, at one point admitting that
she had implicated all four men in exchange for leniency in a
different case against her. DNA samples failed to match the four
men but implicated another man who later confessed to the crime.

   Crime: Raping, strangling and mutilating a 21-year-old waitress,
Debra Sue Carter, in Oklahoma in 1982. The conviction was based
largely on strands of hair left at the crime scene and the
testimony of a witness, Glenn Gore. In 1997, DNA samples from semen
found at the crime scene were tested and found to match Gore's.

<P>
   Robert Lee Miller Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Convicted: 1988
</P>
<P>
   Released: 1998
</P>
<P>
   Crime: The rape and asphyxiation of two women, Anne Laura
Fowler, 83, and Zelma Cutler, 92, in Oklahoma in 1988. A judge
dismissed the case after 10 years, saying the evidence was
insufficient. DNA in a semen sample did not match Miller's DNA, but
did match that of an already-convicted rapist.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Jones
</P>
<P>
   Convicted: 1989
</P>
<P>
   Charges dropped: 1999
</P>
<P>
   Crime: The 1985 rape and murder of Debra Smith in Illinois.
Jones signed a confession that stated that Ms. Smith had agreed to
have sex with him for $10, then attacked him with a knife when he
refused to pay her and was killed in the struggle. In the first
trial, it was shown that Ms. Smith had no history of prostitution;
Jones later said the police had beaten him. But it was not until
1997 that DNA tests used on the semen sample recovered at the crime
scene proved that Jones was the wrong man. The charges against him,
however, weren't dropped until May 1999 after prosecutors decided
against a new trial. He remains in jail on unrelated charges.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Hayes
</P>
<P>
   Convicted: 1991
</P>
<P>
   Released: 1997
</P>
<P>
   Crime: The rape and murder of a co-worker in Florida. Hayes was
convicted largely from DNA evidence that was taken from hair found
in the victim's hands. In 1995, the Florida Supreme Court
overturned Hayes' conviction when it was revealed that the hair was
from a white man; Hayes is black.

 UNDATED: their testimony. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Joseph Burrows
</P>
<P>
   Convicted: 1989
</P>
<P>
   Released: 1994
</P>
<P>
   Crime: The murder of William Dulan, an 88-year-old man, in
Illinois. Although no physical evidence implicated Burrows, two
witnesses testified against him. One later recanted to a newspaper,
claiming coercion by prosecutors and the police. The other witness
confessed to the crime.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Gauger
</P>
<P>
   Convicted: 1993
</P>
<P>
   Released: 1996
</P>
<P>
   Crime: The murder of his parents in Illinois. At his arrest
Gauger was interrogated for more than 16 hours without a lawyer.
Asked to describe how he might have committed the murders, Gauger
complied; his answer was construed as a confession. The same judge
who sentenced him to death later overturned the conviction, finding
little evidence to arrest Gauger in the first place. Last year, a
gang member, on trial for several unrelated crimes, confessed to
murdering Gauger's parents, with an accomplice.
</P>
<P>
   QUESTIONS OF EVIDENCE
</P>
<P>
   Gary Nelson
</P>
<P>
   Convicted: 1980
</P>
<P>
   Released: 1991
</P>
<P>
   Crime: The rape and murder of a 6-year-old girl in Georgia. The
prosecution presented an 8-year-old eyewitness and hair and semen
samples. A volunteer group of lawyers later uncovered large amounts
of suppressed evidence, including FBI tests showing that the
samples belonged to a white man. (Nelson is black.)
</P>
<P>
   John C. Skelton
</P>
<P>
   Convicted: 1983
</P>
<P>
   Released: 1990
</P>
<P>
   Crime: Killing a former employee, Joe Neal, in Texas by rigging
his pickup truck with dynamite. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals
said the prosecution had failed to link Skelton to the crime.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis Lee Kyles
</P>
<P>
   Convicted: 1984
</P>
<P>
   Released: 1998
</P>
<P>
   Crime: The murder of Dolores Dye during a car theft in
Louisiana. The U.S. Supreme Court, which overturned Kyles'
conviction, ruled that the prosecution had withheld material
evidence regarding a paid informant who said Kyles, an
acquaintance, was the murderer. The informant had previously been
suspected of the murder.
</P>
<P>
   Adolph Munson
</P>
<P>
   Convicted: 1985
</P>
<P>
   Released: 1995
</P>
<P>
   Crime: The kidnapping and murder of a store clerk in Oklahoma
while Munson was on work release after serving time for a 1964
murder. After nine years of appeals and an investigative report by
the American Bar Association, the state's highest criminal appeals
court overturned his conviction, finding that Oklahoma prosecutors
had suppressed evidence that supported Munson's innocence,
including the testimony of eyewitnesses who claimed the murderer
was white. (Munson is black.) He was acquitted in retrial.
</P>
<P>
   Jay C. Smith
</P>
<P>
   Convicted: 1986
</P>
<P>
   Released: 1992
</P>
<P>
   Crime: The 1979 murder of a teacher and her two children in
Pennsylvania; the prosecution charged that Smith, a principal,
acted with the victim's fiance, who was later sentenced to three
life terms. In 1989, the conviction was reversed because of hearsay
evidence and because the prosecution was found to have suppressed
evidence that strongly implicated the fiance as the lone murderer.
The Pennsylvania Supreme Court wrote that the prosecution had
violated all principles of justice and fairness.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley P. Scott
</P>
<P>
   Convicted: 1988
</P>
<P>
   Released: 1991
</P>
<P>
   Crime: Murdering a woman friend in 1978 in Florida. The document
stating his whereabouts at the time of the crime had been
misplaced; the police claimed to have an eyewitness who placed
Scott at the crime scene. The Florida Supreme Court later ruled the
evidence to be insufficient.
</P>
<P>
   Sabrina Butler
</P>
<P>
   Convicted: 1990
</P>
<P>
   Released: 1995
</P>
<P>
   Crime: Killing her 9-month-old son, Walter, in Mississippi.
Butler said the baby stopped breathing and she tried to resuscitate
him before taking him to a hospital. She was later acquitted when a
neighbor, who did not testify at the original trial, substantiated
her story. Tests on the child's exhumed body pointed to kidney
disease as a cause of death.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Golden
</P>
<P>
   Convicted: 1991
</P>
<P>
   Released: 1994
</P>
<P>
   Crime: Drowning his wife in Florida. Though the death was
initially ruled accidental, Golden was later tried and found
guilty. On appeal, the Florida Supreme Court said the state failed
to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Mrs. Golden's death
resulted from the criminal agency of another person rather than by
accident.
</P>
<P>
   Randall Padgett
</P>
<P>
   Convicted: 1992
</P>
<P>
   Released: 1997
</P>
<P>
   Crime: The stabbing death of his estranged wife in Alabama. His
conviction was based almost entirely on blood samples left at the
scene, which were tested for DNA. It was later discovered that the
FBI crime lab had determined that the blood was not Padgett's, but
Alabama prosecutors had suppressed that fact. Padgett was acquitted
at a retrial.
</P>
<P>
   WRONG DNA
</P>
<P>
   Rolando Cruz
</P>
<P>
   Alejandro Hernandez
</P>
<P>
   Convicted: 1985
</P>
<P>
   Released: 1996
</P>
<P>
   Crime: The 1983 rape and murder of 10-year-old Jeanine Nicarico
in Illinois. The men, who knew one another, were jointly tried,
convicted and sentenced to death. They won a new trial after the
state Supreme Court ruled that they should have been tried
separately. After the second trial they were convicted again, with
Hernandez getting 80 years. DNA tests in 1994 implicated a
convicted sex offender, Brian Dugan, who, during a plea bargain,
confessed to six murders, including Jeanine Nicarico's.
</P>
<P>
   Kirk Bloodsworth
</P>
<P>
   Convicted: 1984
</P>
<P>
   Released: 1993
</P>
<P>
   Crime: The 1984 rape and murder of 9-year-old girl in Maryland.
Bloodsworth resembled the composite sketch of the suspect; police
said he gave information about the crime. The first conviction was
reversed because the prosecution withheld psychiatric evidence, but
he was convicted again in 1986, all the while pleading his
innocence. ``If I'm dead, that's it,'' he told the judge at that
time. ``You can't bring me back.'' In 1993 DNA from the scene was
found not to match Bloodsworth's.

</P>
<P>
   Convicted: 1979
</P>
<P>
   Released: 1996
</P>
<P>
   Crime: The 1978 abduction, torture and murder of a couple in a
suburb of Chicago. The case against them and two others relied
heavily on eyewitness testimony by one witness, Paula Gray, who
changed her testimony several times, at one point admitting that
she had implicated all four men in exchange for leniency in a
different case against her. DNA samples failed to match the four
men but implicated another man who later confessed to the crime.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Williamson
</P>
<P>
   Convicted: 1988
</P>
<P>
   Released: 1999
</P>
<P>
   Crime: Raping, strangling and mutilating a 21-year-old waitress,
Debra Sue Carter, in Oklahoma in 1982. The conviction was based
largely on strands of hair left at the crime scene and the
testimony of a witness, Glenn Gore. In 1997, DNA samples from semen
found at the crime scene were tested and found to match Gore's.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Lee Miller Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Convicted: 1988
</P>
<P>
   Released: 1998
</P>
<P>
   Crime: The rape and asphyxiation of two women, Anne Laura
Fowler, 83, and Zelma Cutler, 92, in Oklahoma in 1988. A judge
dismissed the case after 10 years, saying the evidence was
insufficient. DNA in a semen sample did not match Miller's DNA, but
did match that of an already-convicted rapist.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Jones
</P>
<P>
   Convicted: 1989
</P>
<P>
   Charges dropped: 1999

   Crime: The 1985 rape and murder of Debra Smith in Illinois.
Jones signed a confession that stated that Ms. Smith had agreed to
have sex with him for $10, then attacked him with a knife when he
refused to pay her and was killed in the struggle. In the first
trial, it was shown that Ms. Smith had no history of prostitution;
Jones later said the police had beaten him. But it was not until
1997 that DNA tests used on the semen sample recovered at the crime

<TEXT>
<P>
   Here is a courtroom scene that lawyers in the fledgling field of
animal law say will unfold sometime soon.
</P>
<P>
   A great ape will appear in the courtroom. A lawsuit, perhaps
protesting the ape's life behind bars, will have been filed in the
animal's name. The ape will then testify using sign language or a
voice synthesizer to support the claim that, contrary to centuries
of law, it has legal rights, including a fundamental right to
liberty.
</P>
<P>
   Fiction? An animal activist's dream?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps. But a growing group of lawyers and legal academics say
they are plotting strategies to bring such a suit, perhaps within a
decade. Such a trial, they say, is the inevitable culmination of
challenges they are starting to make to the principle that animals
are property without legal rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be a very important case,'' said William A.
Reppy Jr., a Duke University law professor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has never happened before. An animal has never conversed
with a judge,'' added Reppy, who has joined in a briefing about a
potential great ape case.
</P>
<P>
   Plans for a new Monkey Trial may never amount to more than a
flight of legal imagination. But the plans reveal the strategy of
an increasingly credible group of animal-rights lawyers who say the
United States will be hearing much more from them in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Their goal is to make it intellectually uncomfortable for the
legal system to continue to declare that animals lack legal rights
because they are property. That simple legal proposition is the
foundation for many common human activities, including the eating
of meat, the ownership of pets, all forms of animal exhibition,
hunting and animal experimentation.
</P>
<P>
   In essence, the lawyers want to challenge the status quo by
asking the courts to look closely at great apes _ large and
intelligent creatures like gorillas, chimpanzees and orangutans
that resemble humans genetically. Some of these apes have been
trained to communicate with humans. The mere presence of such an
animal in court, the lawyers believe, would raise tough questions.
</P>
<P>
   Would mere property _ a stick of furniture, say _ be able to say
anything at all in court?
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea is to find a fact pattern in which the public can
identify with the moral position,'' said David S. Favre, a law
professor at Detroit College of Law at Michigan State University.
Favre is a participant in one planning group for such cases, the
Great Ape Legal Project, which is part of the Animal Legal Defense
Fund, a national organization.
</P>
<P>
   The moral position advanced by some animal-rights lawyers is
that the legal system has drawn the line in the wrong place between
humans, whom they see as animals with rights, and animals without
rights.
</P>
<P>
   They say great apes, who most closely resemble humans, pose the
question most clearly of whether the law has drawn the line in the
wrong place. But if the line were drawn somewhere else _ if apes
had some rights, for example _ where would the new line be drawn?
Dogs? Cows? Chickens? Lobsters?
</P>
<P>
   For these lawyers, the beauty of a great ape case is that it
would open the courthouse door without forcing them to answer such
questions about the likes of lobsters and chickens.
</P>
<P>
   Joyce Tischler, executive director of the Animal Legal Defense
Fund, said it was too early in the evolution of animal law to know
where a new line ought to be drawn. ``Where do I stop?'' she asked.
``My perspective is: I'd like to get started.''
</P>
<P>
   She is not alone. An increasing number of lawyers say they are
full- or part-time animal law specialists interested in testing the
boundaries of established legal principles. There are conferences,
legal books and bar committees on animal law. About a dozen law
schools now teach animal law, including Harvard, Georgetown, the
University of Vermont and the University of California at Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   All sorts of lawyers, from pet lovers to budding entrepreneurs,
say they are drawn to animal law. Their adversaries say the lawyers
should not be underestimated and have substantial financial backing
from animal welfare organizations.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``They have decided the courts are available to them and they
are very good at it,'' said William P. Horn, a Washington lawyer
and a former Reagan administration Interior Department official,
who often represents hunting groups.
</P>
<P>
   Modest cases, some animal-rights lawyers say, could set the
stage for ambitious suits like a great ape case. Some legal
scholars, for example, are considering whether the legal system can
justify common but arguably cruel farming practices, like the close
confinement of animals raised for slaughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you decide some farm practices are cruel and animals
should not be treated cruelly,'' said David J. Wolfson, a New York
lawyer, ``you have to ask: What are animals' nature? And how should
we treat them?''
</P>
<P>
   Wolfson, a mergers and acquisitions lawyer at the prestigious
law firm Milbank, Tweed, Hadley &AMP; McCloy, has a sideline interest
in animal law. He has just published a law review article on the
legal issues presented by common farming practices.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Wolfson said raising questions about the
treatment of farm animals could be part of a continuum leading
toward a great ape suit.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, lawyers considering a great ape case say they
are evaluating very practical legal questions, like whether an ape
could be sworn in as a witness.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that the law generally requires proof that a
witness knows the difference between right and wrong. There is not
yet proof that a court would be likely to accept that apes
understand what humans mean by those concepts.
</P>
<P>
   Steven M. Wise, a Boston lawyer who will teach a course in
animal law at Harvard this spring, said one issue is what legal
mechanism could be used to file a great ape suit, since the law
requires that suits be filed by people with the authority to bring
suit.
</P>
<P>
   One solution Wise proposes is the use of slavery-era statutes
that enabled slaves _ legally nonpersons at the time _ to bring
suits. The statutes were passed to authorize suits by slaves who
said they were held improperly _ because they were white, for
example.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there is also the problem all would-be legal
reformers face: finding the right plaintiff for a landmark case.
Some lawyers say it is possible that no communicating ape would be
mistreated enough to warrant a suit. Some say another case, perhaps
involving a different animal entirely, could present itself first
as a confounding moral challenge to the legal system.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is concern about what a communicating primate might
say in court. ``I know they don't talk much better than a
4-year-old,'' Reppy of Duke said. Last month an orangutan who had
been taught to use a voice synthesizer in Atlanta said this:
``Please buy me a hamburger.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the chance, a great ape might not make an eloquent plea
for freedom. But its lawyers would hope that any words uttered from
an animal to a judge would be powerful simply because they were
uttered.

   ``They have decided the courts are available to them and they
are very good at it,'' said William P. Horn, a Washington lawyer
and a former Reagan administration Interior Department official,
who often represents hunting groups.
</P>
<P>
   Modest cases, some animal-rights lawyers say, could set the
stage for ambitious suits like a great ape case. Some legal
scholars, for example, are considering whether the legal system can
justify common but arguably cruel farming practices, like the close
confinement of animals raised for slaughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you decide some farm practices are cruel and animals
should not be treated cruelly,'' said David J. Wolfson, a New York
lawyer, ``you have to ask: What are animals' nature? And how should
we treat them?''
</P>
<P>
   Wolfson, a mergers and acquisitions lawyer at the prestigious
law firm Milbank, Tweed, Hadley &AMP; McCloy, has a sideline interest
in animal law. He has just published a law review article on the
legal issues presented by common farming practices.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Wolfson said raising questions about the
treatment of farm animals could be part of a continuum leading
toward a great ape suit.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, lawyers considering a great ape case say they
are evaluating very practical legal questions, like whether an ape
could be sworn in as a witness.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that the law generally requires proof that a
witness knows the difference between right and wrong. There is not
yet proof that a court would be likely to accept that apes
understand what humans mean by those concepts.
</P>
<P>
   Steven M. Wise, a Boston lawyer who will teach a course in
animal law at Harvard this spring, said one issue is what legal
mechanism could be used to file a great ape suit, since the law
requires that suits be filed by people with the authority to bring
suit.
</P>
<P>
   One solution Wise proposes is the use of slavery-era statutes
that enabled slaves _ legally nonpersons at the time _ to bring
suits. The statutes were passed to authorize suits by slaves who
said they were held improperly _ because they were white, for
example.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there is also the problem all would-be legal
reformers face: finding the right plaintiff for a landmark case.
Some lawyers say it is possible that no communicating ape would be
mistreated enough to warrant a suit. Some say another case, perhaps
involving a different animal entirely, could present itself first
as a confounding moral challenge to the legal system.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is concern about what a communicating primate might
say in court. ``I know they don't talk much better than a
4-year-old,'' Reppy of Duke said. Last month an orangutan who had
been taught to use a voice synthesizer in Atlanta said this:
``Please buy me a hamburger.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the chance, a great ape might not make an eloquent plea
for freedom. But its lawyers would hope that any words uttered from
an animal to a judge would be powerful simply because they were
uttered.

   UNITED NATIONS _ A new malady is stalking the presidential
palaces and bunkers of the world. Call it the Pinochet syndrome.
Last week, it surfaced in Austria and Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   The Austrian case involved Izzat Ibrahim al-Duri, regarded as
the No. 2 man in Iraq after Saddam Hussein. A Vienna city
councilman, Peter Pilz, discovered that Ibrahim, who is accused of
directing the mass murder of Kurds in 1988 and torturing and
killing other Iraqi citizens, was in a Vienna hospital for
treatment. Following the precedent set by a Spanish judge who was
able to have Gen. Augusto Pinochet of Chile arrested while he was
in London last year for medical care, Pilz filed a criminal
complaint with Austrian authorities on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Less than 48 hours later, Ibrahim made a hasty exit, and
Austria, to the consternation of human rights groups, let him go.
So did Jordan, since Ibrahim had to pass through Amman on his way
back to Iraq. From now on, however, Ibrahim may have to settle for
hospitals in Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   In Jakarta, Indonesia, a leading newspaper said the Pinochet
syndrome also haunts President Suharto, who was forced from office
last year after three decades of autocratic rule. Suharto, who is
under investigation by the new Indonesian government, has been
living at his home in relative peace. But he is 78 years old and
seriously ill, having suffered both a stroke and intestinal
bleeding in the last month.
</P>
<P>
   Like other strongmen who tolerate inferior health care for
everyone but themselves, Suharto had been expected to seek medical
treatment in Germany, as he has done in the past. Not likely,
people close to his family told The Jakarta Post. A host of people
would be waiting with warrants.
</P>
<P>
   If the trend continues, says Reed Brody, advocacy director for
Human Rights Watch, former dictators will have almost nowhere to
go, in sickness or in health. Some might even feel less secure
about where they are now, with human rights lawyers showing a new,
post-Pinochet interest in pursuing them.
</P>
<P>
   Human Rights Watch has compiled a list of ex-tyrants who have
fled their battered countries for what they thought were safer
addresses. Idi Amin of Uganda is still in Saudi Arabia; Jean-Claude
Duvalier of Haiti is in France, and one of his successors, Raul
Cedras, is in Panama; Paraguay's Alfredo Stroessner is in Brazil;
and Hissan Habre of Chad is in Senegal.
</P>
<P>
   The spread of the Pinochet syndrome, says Human Rights Watch,
``shows how far we have come from the days when despots could
terrorize their own populations, secure in the knowledge that at
worst they would face a tranquil exile.''

   Deep in Space, a Cosmic Puzzle
</P>
<P>
   Astronomers think they understand much about how the universe
began, why stars shine and galaxies take majestic shape, and where
planets orbit other stars. But one tiny point of faint light deep
in the northern sky in the constellation Serpens has astronomers
mystified.
</P>
<P>
   They don't know if they are seeing some odd variation of a
familiar object or the first evidence of something entirely
unsuspected, perhaps a challenge to cherished theories.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since it was detected three years ago, the mystery object
has confounded astronomers because they cannot decipher the
language of its light. Usually, they are able in minutes or hours
to determine an object's composition, distance and nature by
breaking down and analyzing its light spectrum. Not this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen a spectrum anything like this, and I take
spectra for a living,'' said Dr. S. George Djorgovski, an
astronomer at the California Institute of Technology whose team at
Palomar Observatory detected the mystery object.
</P>
<P>
   Repeated photographs reveal only a steady light, neither flaring
nor fading over time, which would appear to rule out a stellar
explosion, or supernova. Nor is it recognizable as a distant galaxy
or a quasar, sources of tremendous energy believed to be powered by
matter falling into massive black holes.
</P>
<P>
   If it turns out to be a quasar, some scientists speculate, it is
almost certainly a rare kind beyond current understanding. Other
astronomers and some of the most powerful telescopes have been
called on to help solve the mystery.
</P>
<P>
   With bigger, more sensitive telescopes, astronomers may have to
get used to new mysteries like this one. As Djorgovski said, ``We
can't think we have discovered all the kinds of things there are
out there.''

   A Brownout Hits New England
</P>
<P>
   One word that Yankees dread more than ``drought'' is ``drab.''
And a menacing brown is enveloping New England roadsides, as
thirsty red oaks and sugar maples shed their shriveled leaves a
good two months before the invasion of tourists drawn to the
region's foliage show each fall.
</P>
<P>
   Foresters fear that by the time the leaf-peepers begin clogging
mountain roads next month, the only leaves left will be a muddy
mustard color, with the coveted scarlet, purple and fiery orange _
the spectacular death throes of a healthy leaf _ available only on
postcards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not seeing a lot of outright death,'' said Glenn D.
Dreyer, director of the Connecticut College Arboretum. ``But I'm
seeing a lot of defoliating and browning out.''
</P>
<P>
   The quest for the peak leaf week, an annual obsession that
includes nightly updates from television weathercasters and Web-cam
views offered by state tourism departments, may become even more
desperate than usual. (Botanists patiently explain that the only
sure way to know a leaf has peaked is when it falls off.)
</P>
<P>
   Farmers, who could lose their crops, are annoyed by the leaf
panic, and hard-core hikers are bemused. But foliage-gawking has
become an $8 billion annual business in New England, with tour
packagers offering journeys by bus, boat and rail, with hot
chocolate included.
</P>
<P>
   So proprietors like Rolf Hammer, owner of the Homestead Inn in
New Milford, Conn., are scrambling to save the season. ``The
scenery isn't just trees,'' he points out. That may be little
consolation to the tourists who visit the same stand of trees each
year, or the ones who wait for rain so they can revel in the
contrast between the vivid leaves and the dark earth.
</P>
<P>
   But there is an upside. Wineries in New England say the dry,
sunny summer will produce smaller but more flavorful grapes. So
next season tasting may rival peeping as the region's leading
autumn attraction.

   Metropolitan Life Agrees to Settle Fraud Suits
</P>
<P>
   Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. agreed to settle lawsuits that
accused the company of using deceptive sale practices to cheat
policyholders out of billions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Metropolitan Life, the nation's second-largest life insurer,
placed the value of the deal, which is subject to approval by a
federal judge, at $1.7 billion, though fees for the plaintiffs'
lawyers' and other costs will come from that sum. Some 7 million
customers who bought life insurance and annuities between 1982 and
1997 can seek to get cash or increases in their death benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuits against Metropolitan Life, like similar ones
against other life insurers, alleged that the company, competing
for consumers' money with banks paying high interest, persuaded
customers to trade in valuable existing policies for more costly
ones, a practice called ``churning.''

   Corruption in Bosnia
</P>
<P>
   An American-led anti-fraud unit investigating corruption in
Bosnia reported that up to $1 billion has been stolen from
international aid projects or has disappeared from public funds or
been lost through Bosnian officials' failure to collect taxes. The
investigators documented the fraud in a report that names several
officials linked to governing parties that it says profited from
the corruption.
</P>
<P>
   At least $20 million of the total was in foreign aid; the vast
majority was stolen from Bosnian public funds or lost through
uncollected taxes. The missing money was to have been spent to
repair roads, buildings and schools, as well as to provide
municipal services in Bosnian towns.
</P>
<P>
   Bias Seen in Spy Case
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese atomic spy scandal, for months a shadowy maze of
complex allegations, has been roiled anew by charges of racial
bias.
</P>
<P>
   A key investigator in the case asserted that Wen Ho Lee, a
Taiwan-born scientist at the Los Alamos weapons lab in New Mexico
who became the top suspect, had been unfairly singled out four
years ago for federal investigation because of his ethnicity.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of Caucasians'' with equivalent access to secrets and
trips to China were not investigated, said Robert S. Vrooman, the
former head of counterintelligence at the Los Alamos National
Laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   Energy Department officials denied the charge. ``Race was never
a factor,'' said Notra Trulock, who began the federal probe in
1995.

   Russian Coalition Gets a Lift
</P>
<P>
   A new center-left coalition in Russia gained momentum when
Yevgeny Primakov, the popular former prime minister who was fired
three months ago by President Boris Yeltsin, decided to join the
alliance in advance of parliamentary elections in December.
</P>
<P>
   The Fatherland-All Russia coalition, led by the mayor of Moscow,
Yuri Luzhkov, appears poised to take a commanding lead in the
coming campaign. It remains unclear whether Luzhkov or Primakov, a
Soviet-era survivor and former spymaster, will emerge as the
alliance's leading candidate in the presidential election in 2000,
when Yeltsin is scheduled to step down.

   Starr to Leave Soon
</P>
<P>
   After five years of investigation, independent counsel Kenneth
Starr has decided to call it quits. His associates said he would
step aside to resume his private law practice as early as October.
Starr plans to stay to put the last touches on a final report on
his inquiries _ a document that could embarrass Hillary Rodham
Clinton as she moves closer to entering the New York Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   Starr will depart with his reputation for scholarly probity
damaged by attacks from Clinton's supporters _ even as Starr
uncovered an Oval Office sex scandal that led to Clinton's
impeachment in the House and his subsequent trial and acquittal in
the Senate.

   A Lutheran-Episcopalian Link
</P>
<P>
   Another merger? Big deal. Banks and media companies routinely
gobble one another for breakfast. But this one's different: The
nation's largest Lutheran group voted to link up with the Episcopal
Church. It's not a merger exactly, for each will keep its rituals.
But the plan, involving nearly 8 million American Protestants,
bears a striking resemblance to deals out in the cold corporate
world, for it involves, basically, economies of scale. When
congregations are small and poor, they could, say, pool resources
or share a pastor.
</P>
<P>
   But here's where it diverges from the corporate model: It will
not, presumably, involve layoffs among the faithful.

   Pursuers of Diana Cleared
</P>
<P>
   The Paris prosecutor's office concluded that nine celebrity
photographers and a photo-agency motorcycle driver arrested after
the crash that killed Diana, Princess of Wales, her escort and
their French driver two years ago bore no criminal responsibility
for the accident.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors' report said the accident appeared to have been
caused by the driver of the Mercedes S280 limousine, who was
inebriated and traveling at an excessive speed. The two
investigating magistrates who carried out the probe have the last
word on whether to bring charges and are expected to rule by Aug.
31, the second anniversary of Diana's death.

   China Sets Production Limits
</P>
<P>
   After years of fearing the social consequences of runaway
inflation, China's leaders now face the opposite problem:
deflation. Prices have fallen for 22 months in a row, leaving
factories with stacks of unbought goods. Yet the state-run nature
of operations means many local officials are still eager to open
even more factories.
</P>
<P>
   In a drastic move to stop them, China's leaders ordered a
nationwide ban on any new production of several consumer goods, as
well as on all new luxury hotels, apartment and office buildings
and department stores. The unanswered question is how well the ban
will be enforced.

   School Drug Test Challenge
</P>
<P>
   High-school students in Tecumseh, Okla. _ as well as in school
districts in North Carolina, Idaho and Wyoming, among other states
_ have been subject to drug testing if they wish to participate in
extracurricular activities like the debate team, the drama club,
even the Future Farmers of America. Otherwise, they risk being
dropped from the activity.
</P>
<P>
   Though the testing of high-school athletes has gone largely
unchallenged after the Supreme Court upheld an Oregon program in
1995, the American Civil Liberties Union believes the Tecumseh
policy goes too far. The group has filed suit against the district
in federal court in Oklahoma City.

   A New Bacteria Threat
</P>
<P>
   More than 200 people in Minnesota and North Dakota have become
sick _ and four children have died _ over the past two years from a
drug-resistant bacteria that for more than 30 years has been
confined to hospitals and nursing homes.
</P>
<P>
   The fatalities were the first reported in the United States from
the germ, a strain of Staphylococcus aureus, and federal officials
don't know if the bug has spread. But the deaths suggest the public
is now at risk.

   Huge Japanese Bank Merger
</P>
<P>
   Three giant Japanese banks _ Industrial Bank of Japan, Fuji Bank
and Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank _ announced their intention to merge.
Combined, they would have $1.3 trillion in assets and become the
world's No. 1 banking powerhouse. But if Japanese banking history
is any indication, bigger does not mean better. Large or small,
Japanese banks are not highly profitable, especially when compared
with American rivals.

IN CALCUTTA, A WRITER FINDS JOY IN DEEDS, NOT WORDS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: France , Colo.)  (mk) 
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Dominique Lapierre has ranged over several continents
in his best-selling books on modern history, but only one place has
never let go of him. More than two decades ago, after the
publication of ``Freedom at Midnight,'' the story of Indian
independence, Lapierre went back to India to try to share his
success with the people who had inspired his work.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the beginning of an adventure that never stopped,'' he
said in an interview during a recent stopover in New York. He was
on his way home to France with his wife, also named Dominique,
after talking to business executives in Aspen, Colo., about the
private aid projects the couple finance.
</P>
<P>
   The projects assist the lepers of Calcutta and the poor fishing
communities on islands in the Ganges delta, where old ferry boats
have been converted into floating clinics.
</P>
<P>
   ``The boats serve 900,000 inhabitants of 57 islands not on the
map of the world,'' he said. ``These people do not exist.''
</P>
<P>
   They are so poor, he said, that they are without transistor
radios to warn them of cyclones. They fall prey to tigers, snakes
and, overwhelmingly, tuberculosis.
</P>
<P>
   Lapierre, 68, calculates that he has spent $5 million on his
small and largely unpublicized projects, drawn from royalties on
his books and those, like ``Freedom at Midnight,'' that he wrote
with the American writer Larry Collins. Along the way he has
learned some hard lessons, he said. He has come to distrust
official foreign aid _ from governments, the United Nations and big
international agencies. He says his misgivings were borne out in
his now-abandoned efforts to get help from the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of their requisites is that 60 percent of the amount they
will give you will have to be in fixed assets,'' he said. ``That
is, they'll force you to build an institution. To buy ambulances _
things that they can see. What we need is to buy drugs, to hire
doctors, to hire teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The result of this thinking is that the Third World today is
absolutely full of empty, useless, unoccupied, lavish installations
where there are no longer any doors, any beds, any windows, any
patients, any doctors, any drugs. Because after the glorious
inauguration of an institution, with all the media and the
politicians, one year later it's a vacuum.''
</P>
<P>
   Without local involvement, he says, the projects turn derelict.
</P>
<P>
   The Lapierres _ she works with women on basic literacy,
education and health programs that complement his projects _ have
also had their share of problems with India. In the 1980s, the
state government of West Bengal opposed plans to film his novel of
slum life in Calcutta, ``City of Joy,'' in that city. The
government thought it would make the city look bad.
</P>
<P>
   Lapierre, who is impatient and dismissive of bureaucracy and
something of a street fighter when challenged _ a lot of people
find his intensity and his big personality overwhelming _ overcame
those obstacles. He is triumphantly amused that a sign outside
Calcutta's airport now welcomes travelers to the City of Joy.
</P>
<P>
   He has been less successful in dealing with India's pervasive
corruption. His clinics, all run by Indians, are entitled to free
medicine from the government for 300,000 tuberculosis patients.
``We never _ never _ get more than 10 percent,'' he said. ``The
rest is stolen on the way. So we are forced to buy drugs on the
open market, which is a drain on our budget.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lapierres operate their private aid project on a minimal
budget, they say. ``We have no office,'' he said. ``We have no
staff. When we travel to India, Dominique and I, we pay our own
tickets, economy class.'' Three years ago, they sold a large house
in St. Tropez and moved to a smaller one. ``Royalties are not
eternal,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Lapierres, who also give poor village women small dowries to
allow them to marry a bit above the lowest rungs of life, say they
have been changed forever by their experiences in India, especially
by their life in Calcutta while he wrote ``City of Joy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``One morning I was awakened by a procession passing by in the
alley with drums and songs and people chanting,'' he recalled. ``I
said, `What happens here today?' Do you know what they answered?
`We are celebrating the birth of spring.' In a place where there is
not a tree, not a flower, not a leaf, not a bird, not a butterfly,
they celebrated an event they would never see.''
</P>
<P>
   When they left India soon after, the Lapierres had 30 pounds of
excess baggage ``in gifts from people whose average resource for
survival is, I would say, about three U.S. cents a day,'' he said.
The generosity of the poor has never waned, he said, although 350
million Indians go to bed hungry at night. ``These people are the
real heroes of the planet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When we come back to Paris,'' he said, ``finding a parking
space on the Champs-Elysees is no longer a priority.''

HECTIC FLOW, BUT ARMSTRONG SPINS ALONG

   MOUNT SNOW, Vt. _ For Lance Armstrong, winning the Tour de
France was only the beginning. Since his near-miraculous recovery
from cancer surgery less than three years ago and then his
improbable triumph in the world's most celebrated bicycle race, his
life has been one festive moment after another.
</P>
<P>
   The public mobs him. The news media enjoys his fresh responses
to questions. Advertisers have made him a target almost as
appealing as Michael Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong's $400,000 salary from the U.S. Postal Service team
will jump to $2 million next year. The Austin American-Statesman,
his hometown newspaper, said salary, endorsements, a movie and a
book would bring his 2000 income to $5 million.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview over dinner Friday night, Armstrong said he was
baffled by his new celebrity status.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to be me and understand what I mean to people,'' he
said. ``If I walk through an airport now and get stopped by
someone, it still surprises me. Am I the same guy? I think so.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm enjoying this. It won't last forever. If you lose the fame
and the recognition, it all goes away. I know that. I'm not
addicted to this. I have to know that in 10 years' time I'll be
another ex-athlete. And that's fine with me. Maybe some people will
remember me, but people forget. That doesn't bother me. The cause _
the foundation _ will live on.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lance Armstrong Foundation subsidizes cancer research and
helps cancer patients and their families deal with the illness.
Armstrong, whose testicular cancer spread to his abdomen, lungs and
brain before being wiped out by intense chemotherapy, has pledged
at least $250,000 to the foundation next year.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong has been here for the Chevy Trucks national finals for
mountain bikes. He said racing mountain bikes was far different
from racing road bikes, but he rode impressively Friday in
finishing sixth in the men's cross-country race.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, his schedule had two major stops. The first, at 6:30
a.m., was fishing. The next, in the afternoon, was a cross-country
short-track race, consisting of 30 minutes of loops around a 3/4
mile course plus three finishing laps.
</P>
<P>
   He is racing mountain bikes here because he likes the change and
the challenge. Last winter, he agreed to race this week and in
Colorado next week for Trek-Volkswagen. Had the agreement been made
after the Tour de France, Armstrong would have made much more
money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' he said, ``but money isn't that important. The illness
changed a lot of that. Before, I was motivated by making money.
I'll earn more this year than I ever did in my life, but that's not
important. It's important in the sense that I have a family, but
I'd rather have my health than money.''
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, he has it all, including wonderful memories since
the day he became only the second American (after Greg LeMond) to
win the Tour de France. There was the parade lap on the
Champs-Elysees, the visit to President Clinton in the White House,
the television appearance with David Letterman, the parade in
Austin. His training has suffered. So have his eating habits,
although his weight is still under control.
</P>
<P>
   ``For five months,'' he said, ``I ate like a monk. Since the
night the race ended, I've been eating what I like _ chitterlings,
beer, ice cream, hamburgers.''
</P>
<P>
   As he said this, he was attacking a ham sandwich and perhaps the
world's largest order of french fries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life has been extremely hectic,'' he said. ``The attention and
the response have been much bigger than I thought. I've been very
busy, and I have another month of this crazy schedule.''
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend, he squeezed in four days with his wife, Kristin,
in Vail, Colo. ``We finally had time to ourselves,'' he said. ``No
media, no appearances.''
</P>
<P>
   Kristin is expecting their first child in October and is cutting
back on travel. She stayed in Vail while Armstrong flew here
Tuesday. He will fly to Vail on Sunday before returning home. Then
comes another round of trips _ to Portland, Ore., for a visit to
Nike and a four-month health checkup; to Las Vegas for a bike show,
to College Station, Tex., for wind-tunnel testing for new bikes.
</P>
<P>
   He knows he will be a marked man in next year's Tour de France.
He talked about Miguel Indurain of Spain, who won five in a row in
the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's probably not going to happen with me,'' Armstrong said.
``But I'm 27, and in cycling you can be competitive until 31 or 32.
I think you win one or you win five or six. Well, nobody ever won
six. It's hard to win one.''

<P>
   ATLANTA _ The five Americans who died in the Turkish earthquake
last week belonged to a family of doctors who had been visiting
Turkey for decades.
</P>
<P>
   Turkan and Nizam Kilic, both pediatricians, came to the United
States in the 1950s to complete their residencies, and they set up
a practice in Birmingham, Ala., that they maintained for more than
30 years.
</P>
<P>
   In their retirement, they moved to Atlanta to be closer to their
three sons, all anesthesiologists, who practiced there.
</P>
<P>
   Lately the elder Kilics had returned to Yalova, Turkey, for four
months every year, said Diane Kilic, a daughter-in-law. Their sons,
wives and grandchildren also visited often.
</P>
<P>
   Family members had been in Yalova, about 30 miles southeast of
Istanbul, when the earthquake struck. Five were killed: Nizam Kilic
and four grandchildren: Jeffrey, 6; Jennifer, 5; David, 2; and
Katie, 9 months.
</P>
<P>
   Nizam's wife, Turkan, and his daughter-in-law, Jan Kilic, the
mother of the children, were found alive and taken to a makeshift
hospital and then to the American Hospital in Istanbul. Turkan was
in critical condition. Jan, though injured, was expected to recover
fully.
</P>
<P>
   Beneath the rubble, Jan could hear the voice of Nizam Kilic, and
they talked, according to Jan's brother Bill Kemp.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nizam kept telling Jan to be strong,'' Kemp said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   But after about 12 hours, Jan Kilic could no longer hear her
father-in-law, Kemp said.
</P>
<P>
   Jan was told that all five of her children were killed, but a
Turkish relative went to the scene and persuaded authorities not to
bulldoze the rubble and to search further.
</P>
<P>
   Four of the children's bodies were found, and after 20 hours of
digging, emergency workers thought they had found the fifth child,
3-year-old Natalie, dead too. But rescuers noticed that the dust
around Natalie's mouth and nose stirred and realized she was
breathing. Natalie survived.

ON GOLF: TALK IS CHEAP. IT'S TIME FOR U.S. PLAYERS TO WIN BACK THE
RYDER CUP
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Recently, there has been plenty of talk about profit from the
Ryder Cup, and less talk about winning it.
</P>
<P>
   The heated debate concerning Ryder Cup revenue, and whether
players should be paid and the money donated to their favorite
charities, has been brewing for several years. It finally reached
the boiling point before the PGA Championship, when details of a
closed-door meeting leaked out faster than a downhill putt at
Augusta National.
</P>
<P>
   However, the issue has done little to diminish interest in next
month's biennial event. Come Sept. 24-26 at The Country Club in
Brookline, Mass., the gallery and the corporate tents will be
packed, as will hotel rooms in Boston and the surrounding areas.
</P>
<P>
   The allure of the Ryder Cup won't be ruined if players are given
money to donate to charity, not with people used to seeing athletes
in other sports sign million-dollar contracts before they catch a
pass, or make a layup. If anything, the squabble gave the Ryder Cup
even more publicity, even if it wasn't the kind of publicity sought
by the PGA of America and the players.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, the days before last week's PGA Championship sounded
like a soap opera, and that is something golf doesn't need. Ben
Crenshaw, the U.S. Ryder Cup captain, publicly chastised four of
his top players _ Tiger Woods, David Duval, Mark O'Meara, and Phil
Mickelson _ who all feel strongly that they should be allowed to
allocate money from the Ryder Cup toward charity. For the next two
days, players took sides, and people began to wonder if this year's
team would need a referee as well as a captain.
</P>
<P>
   But in the coming months, chances seem good that an agreement
will be reached between players and the PGA of America. With Golf
Digest reporting in its September issue that the Ryder Cup will
gross $63 million this year, there is enough money to satisfy
everyone. The PGA of America can allocate some money toward player
charities and still have ample money left for its many fine
programs that support golf across the country.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. players would be wise to put this issue on the back
burner, keep their mouths closed on the subject and head to The
Country Club with determination to win back the cup. Players can
downplay the importance of the Ryder Cup if they want to, but the
history of the event speaks for itself. The public cares about it.
The greatest players in history from both sides of the Atlantic
have cared about it. And with Europe having won the last two Ryder
Cups, the United States will arrive in Brookline facing extra
pressure.
</P>
<P>
   If the United States wins, then the so-called pay-for-play issue
can't be used as a possible reason for the demise of this year's
team. Winning cures many things, and the public will most likely be
eager to embrace a team that wins the final Ryder Cup match of the
century.
</P>
<P>
   But if the United States is defeated, the money issue will
almost surely be fingered as a reason. You can almost see the
headlines _ the team lacked unity, the players weren't committed
enough. Those things will be said, even if they aren't true. Some
U.S. players felt they were criticized unfairly in 1997 after
losing the Ryder Cup in Spain, but if they lose again next month,
expect the criticism to be harsher.
</P>
<P>
   Without question, this year's U.S. team looks like one of the
most talented ever _ Woods, Duval, Payne Stewart, Davis Love III,
Mark O'Meara, Justin Leonard, Hal Sutton, Tom Lehman, Phil
Mickelson, Jeff Maggert, Jim Furyk and Steve Pate. But one of the
strange things about the Ryder Cup is that Europe always seems to
be underrated.
</P>
<P>
   The final 12-man European team will be decided Sunday night,
when captain Mark James adds his two picks to the top 10 players in
the point standings through Sunday's final round of the BMW
International tournament on the European Tour. But Europe has
proven winners who have already secured their place on the squad _
Jose Maria Olazabal, who won this year's Masters, Paul Lawrie, who
won this year's British Open, 19-year-old Sergio Garcia, who almost
won the PGA Championship, and Europe's two most consistent players,
Colin Montgomerie and Lee Westwood.
</P>
<P>
   The European team is undergoing a transition, with longtime
Ryder Cup stalwarts like Nick Faldo, Ian Woosnam and Constantino
Rocca unlikely to be chosen as captain's picks unless James pulls a
last-minute surprise. For the first time since 1983, Seve
Ballesteros will not be in the Ryder Cup as a player or captain,
and his leadership will be missed by Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, in the last two competitions, the European team has shown a
superior short game, and some of its lesser stars have earned key
points when called upon. Call the United States the favorite if you
wish, but Europe has flourished in the underdog role. And in match
play, especially under intense pressure, almost anything can
happen.
</P>
<P>
   This has already been a splendid year for golf. Each of the four
men's major championships was compelling, from Olazabal's
courageous victory over Greg Norman at the Masters, to Woods'
sensational duel with Garcia at the PGA. Meanwhile, the LPGA Tour
is also enjoying a vintage year, with Juli Inkster completing a
career grand slam and Karrie Webb winning her first major in
comeback fashion.
</P>
<P>
   But the Ryder Cup is always special, no matter what the year, or
what the controversy. It has history, it has suspense, and it has a
tradition that money can't buy. The discussion about Ryder Cup
money is just another reminder that sports has become big business.
However, that shouldn't make the event any less fun to watch.

NEW TERRAIN FOR TANK UNITS: CITIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By STEVEN A. HOLMES    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT KNOX, Ky. _ On 26 acres in the middle of this Army post,
work crews are putting the finishing touches on a mock town of 22
pastel-colored buildings, painting the walls, paving the roads,
stringing electrical wire and landscaping the grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Then will come the armored invasion, when the Army begins to use
this state-of-the-art training area to teach tank units how to
fight in the dangerously crowded confines of an urban center.
</P>
<P>
   As the training area is envisioned by its creators, computerized
technology borrowed from amusement parks will provide the sounds,
sights and surprises that tankers and Bradley fighting vehicle
crews could expect to find in a hostile city.
</P>
<P>
   Railroad cars will suddenly move across a road crossing, cutting
a tank column in two. Electrical wires will dangle overhead, sparks
splaying out from severed ends, forcing a tank commander to decide
whether he can continue forward and how much of a charge his
vehicle can take without electrocuting all inside.
</P>
<P>
   Cars might suddenly explode in front of a tank column on a road;
anti-tank batteries could open fire, splashing the hapless vehicles
with brightly colored paint-ball rounds.
</P>
<P>
   But although the ``town'' is supposed to be ready by December,
its designers do not know when it will be fully put to use. Though
the site's creators are spending roughly $15 million building the
training center _ and several elite units, including the Army's
Rangers, the Navy's Seals and the 101st Airborne Division, are
eager to use it _ the $500,000 needed to put it into operation is a
prisoner of tight training budgets and bureaucratic delays.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to have seed money to stand the site up,'' said F.L.
``Andy'' Andrews, Fort Knox's range manager and one of the
designers of the training facility. ``I've got to have an inventory
of special effects. I've got to have manpower in place and trained
to run this thing.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, Andrews does not have a commitment for any of those.
Under the Defense Department's intricate financing procedures, no
money can be allocated to run the urban training center until the
Armor School, here at Fort Knox, determines where the center will
fit in its curriculum.
</P>
<P>
   But Col. Richard P. Geier, director of the Armor School, said he
could not determine that until the site was up and running, and its
use evaluated.
</P>
<P>
   As the financing is caught in the Army's bureaucratic
round-robin, the Senate has passed an amendment to the military
appropriations bill that provides $1 million for the Fort Knox
urban training site. But the money is not in the House-passed
spending bill for the Pentagon, meaning the two bills will have to
be reconciled in conference.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Fort Knox say the site will open in October, with
low-level training that does not involve the computer-generated
special effects. The officials are confident, they added, that
Congress will provide the money needed to make the site fully
operational by January.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pretty confident we will get the funds,'' said Col. J.C.
Allard, director of operations at Fort Knox. ``I don't think we'll
be delayed in any meaningful way, frankly because there's too much
interest in this.''
</P>
<P>
   Advocates of the new training center say the need has been
growing. For years, American forces have tried to avoid urban areas
where fighting from house to house or street to street is
inherently more difficult for both soldiers and civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, American forces have preferred to fight _ and been
trained to fight _ on open plains where the mobility and firepower
of M1A2 Abrams tanks, Bradley fighting vehicles, Apache helicopter
gunships, mobile howitzers and rocket launchers and low-flying
fighter-bombers can be used to full advantage.
</P>
<P>
   But with the increased use of American troops as peacekeepers in
cities in places like Bosnia and Kosovo, the Army and Marines have
begun setting up centers at places like Fort Benning, Fort Polk and
Camp Lejeune to give a realistic simulation of what it is like to
fight in a crowded city.
</P>
<P>
   Those centers, however, are designed to train light infantry. No
facility currently exists that can provide training for tanks and
armored vehicles either by themselves or in conjunction with
infantry troops.
</P>
<P>
   The need for such combined use of armor and infantry in cities
was demonstrated in 1993 when 18 American soldiers were killed and
75 were wounded during a battle in the streets of Mogadishu in
Somalia. The soldiers were pinned down for hours because they had
no support from tanks or other armored vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Even if tanks had been available, American commanders later
said, neither American infantrymen nor tank crews knew how to fight
alongside each other on city streets because they had never trained
together.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although a lot of people perceive urban combat as an infantry
fight _ and a light infantry fight at that _ that's absolutely not
the case,'' said Russell Glenn, the former chief of staff of the
Third Armored Division who is now a military analyst at the Rand
Corp. ``It is a combined arms fight. The infantryman who does not
have the support of mechanized and armored vehicles can be in big
trouble. Mogadishu was a good example of that.''

BASEBALL NOTEBOOK: TIGERS STYMIE MCGWIRE; LOOKING FOR LEFTIES; GM
ON THE SPOT 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MURRAY CHASS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Go figure. The Detroit pitching staff has given up the most home
runs in the American League this season, second most in the major
leagues, but the Tigers are the only team that has faced Mark
McGwire in the past two seasons and has not allowed him to hit a
home run.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire has hit 11 home runs against San Diego and the Chicago
Cubs, 10 against San Francisco, nine against Florida but none
against the Tigers. In 32 at-bats over eight games, two last
season, six this season, McGwire has eight hits but only one
extra-base hit, a double.
</P>
<P>
   ``We basically stuck with the same approach for two years with
him and made good pitches,'' said Rock Adair, whom the Tigers fired
as their pitching coach last month. ``We just kept the ball away
from him for the most part. We very seldom tried to come inside on
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Dave Mlicki started against St. Louis twice in a week in June
and thwarted McGwire five times in 12 innings, allowing only a
single, walking him once and striking him out twice. In 125 2/3
other innings this season, the right-hander has given up 17 home
runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the wind must have been blowing in,'' Mlicki said,
laughing. Then he added, ``When I faced him in the National League,
we'd try to pitch him in. But here when we faced him, we noticed he
was kind of pulling off the ball. We stayed away from him, threw
soft stuff away, down and away, and tried to run fastballs up and
away. If we came in, we missed in. Pitch him in and down and in and
he just crushes balls.''
</P>
<P>
   Mlicki and his fellow pitchers did not boast about their success
against McGwire. ``If he's hot and feeling good,'' Mlicki said,
``it's not going to matter how you pitch him. We just caught him at
a good time.''
</P>
<P>
   Lefties Left Out
</P>
<P>
   Where are all the left-handers? Don't look for them among the
clubs contending for American League playoff spots. The starting
pitching rotations of six teams have a total of two left-handers.
The Yankees have Andy Pettitte, the Toronto Blue Jays have David
Wells. That's it.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland, Texas, Boston and Oakland have all-right-handed
rotations. Even the replacements for injured starters, with one
exception, have been right-handed. The one exception is Mark
Langston, who has made five fill-in starts for the Indians but who
went on the disabled list last week.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians tried to get Chuck Finley from Anaheim last month
but balked at the Angels' steep price.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one would like to have a left-hander more than me,'' Doug
Melvin, the Rangers' general manager, said. ``Some of those teams
have some potent left-handers in their lineups. Carlos Delgado hit
five home runs against us.''
</P>
<P>
   Time for Change
</P>
<P>
   Season's end grows closer and for some managers and general
managers, it will mark the end of their terms. Randy Smith, the
Tigers' general manager, was last week's hot topic in baseball
circles.
</P>
<P>
   Talk among other executives is that Mike Ilitch, the Tigers'
owner, is not happy with the state of the team as it prepares to
open a new park next season, and he plans to make changes. Smith,
the talk goes, will be fired or will resign. In Part II of the
talk, Smith will replace Bob Gebhard in Colorado as the Rockies'
general manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard none of the above other than they've mentioned me
in Colorado,'' Smith said. ``I'm certainly not going to resign and
I haven't heard anything about being fired. I signed on here to do
a job. We have had a horrible year, no doubt about it. We thought
we'd be a .500 team and we've drastically underachieved that. But I
believe we still have good talent and I'm not going to quit on
doing the job.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith's name has surfaced in Colorado as a possible successor to
Gebhard, who resigned Friday, because he was the Rockies' assistant
general manager in the early '90s. ``I dismiss it,'' Smith said.
``It's just a name people are familiar with. I'm a Tiger and I want
to finish what we've started here.''
</P>
<P>
   Gebhard survived last winter when the Rockies fired Don Baylor
as their manager, but the team made no improvement this season and
a change at the top had been expected. The same could happen in
Detroit, where the Tigers have played as poorly as they did last
season.
</P>
<P>
   And they have played as poorly with a payroll that is nearly
double _ $35 million, up from $19 million. While the Tigers
struggle despite the signing of Dean Palmer (29 home runs) and
Gregg Jefferies (.204) and the reacquisition of Willie Blair (1-9,
6.77), their owner sees Jose Lima (16-7), Luis Gonzalez (.337) and
Joe Randa (.322) succeed elsewhere after the club traded them.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a very competitive man,'' Smith said of Ilitch, who also
owns a team that has won the National Hockey League's Stanley Cup.
``He wants to win now, but he's also realistic about where we
started and what we've had to work with over the last few years.
But he expects results. He expects us to put a good team on the
field when we move into Comerica Park.''

RACE FOR HOME-FIELD ADVANTAGE GAINS IMPORTANCE IN A.L. 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Texas clobbered Cleveland three times, but the Indians won the
fourth game of their series last week. The Rangers get the Yankees
in a three-game series beginning Monday night in Arlington, Texas.
The Indians play a pair of games in Texas Sept. 7 and 8. The
Yankees play four games in Cleveland later in the month.
</P>
<P>
   The games are a prelude to the playoffs for these three teams
destined to be the American League's division champions, and they
are the highlight of the league's third race. First come the
division races, then comes the wild-card competition and finally
there is the dash for home-field advantage.
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't always been thus. Until last year, the format of the
playoffs provided for rotation between the divisions for the league
series and among the divisions for the first-round matchups. The
teams' records meant nothing.
</P>
<P>
   But last year the format was changed to give the team with the
best record home-field advantage in both series. In the
three-of-five-games division series, that team gets the first two
games and the fifth at home; in the four-of-seven-games league
championship series, it gets the first two games and the last two
at home.
</P>
<P>
   Teams are reluctant to talk about the race for home-field
advantage before they clinch a postseason spot, but that is one of
their goals.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Hicks, the Rangers' owner, discussed that goal with his
people at the All-Star Game break last month. ``He got people
motivated to try to do that instead of just looking to get to the
postseason,'' Doug Melvin, Hicks' general manager, said. ``He felt
we'd have a better chance to compete with the Yankees and the
Indians if we got home-field advantage. It's tough to beat them at
their ballpark.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Melvin said, ``We'd like to give more to our fans
than they got last year in postseason play. We lost the first two
games in New York and then gave them five innings here. We came
home and had that horrible rain delay. So our fans haven't had a
chance to get excited about the postseason.''
</P>
<P>
   With their 114 victories last season, the Yankees had home-field
advantage in each of the first two series. The World Series
continues to alternate between leagues. This season the three
division leaders are much more closely bunched with six weeks left.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things can dramatically change every week in this game,''
Melvin said. ``I get nervous talking about it too early. You've got
to be careful. You have to get to the postseason first.''
</P>
<P>
   Brian Cashman, the Yankees' general manager, also spoke of
having to win the division title first but said if the team can
accomplish that, as if there's any question, and gain home-field
advantage, too, ``no doubt that's what we'd like to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only from a playing standpoint,'' Cashman added, ``but
from a business standpoint _ concessions, parking. There are
financial advantages to it.'' Plus, he said, ``You get your crowd.
You'd rather have your crowd than going into some of these
jungles.''
</P>
<P>
   John Hart, the Indians' general manager, offered a different
perspective on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously,'' he said, ``the home-field advantage is very nice
to have, but the only thing we're fighting for right now is to get
our team healthy, which we haven't been the better part of the
year. It's taking its toll not only on our ability to win games
right now but our ability to even think about something like
home-field advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   The Indians easily have the longest injury list among the three
division leaders. Two months ago, the Indians had the best record
among the three teams _46-21 to the Yankees' 39-28 and the Rangers'
39-30 _ but the injuries helped bring the Indians back to the other
teams.
</P>
<P>
   Third baseman Travis Fryman (July 4), catcher Sandy Alomar Jr.
(May 11) and designated hitter Wil Cordero (June 9) remain on the
disabled list. Center fielder Kenny Lofton had been there and may
return.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he's not back in four, five days,'' Hart said of Lofton,
``we'll have to disable him again.'' Alomar could be back this week
and Fryman may be ready the first week of September. The Indians,
however, can only hope that Cordero can play by mid-September.
</P>
<P>
   ``The priority is for us to get healthy and hold the fort until
we do,'' Hart said. ``Last year we had home-field advantage in the
division series and it worked to our benefit. We didn't have
home-field advantage against the Yankees and it hurt us.''

WHEN AN OLD DRUG QUESTION BECOMES NEW NEWS
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By FELICITY BARRINGER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush's refusal to give a yes or no answer
when asked if he had used cocaine had been old news since his first
campaign for governor in 1994. Then, he rebuffed the question with
the words: ``What I did as a kid? I don't think it's relevant.''
</P>
<P>
   There the question and answer stood, basically unchanged, as the
governor rose to national political prominence. He gave the same
answer to New Hampshire station WMUR-TV in February, and to The
Washington Post last month. In the meantime, droves of reporters
came through Texas and asked questions; to date, none has reported
evidence of cocaine use.
</P>
<P>
   But in the last three weeks, the alchemy of repetition made the
old question new news in some news outlets. On Wednesday and
Thursday, Bush made it even newer news by changing his answer. The
process highlighted the changed dynamics of political reporting in
this presidential campaign, which is being brought to voters by
more news and entertainment outlets than ever before. It also
reveals rifts among journalists as they decide what is appropriate
to ask, and what is appropriate to publish.
</P>
<P>
   A question about possible prior cocaine use ``is a fair question
to ask,'' said Richard A. Oppel, editor of The Austin
American-Statesman, in a telephone interview. ``But it's also worth
asking, `How many times can you ask the same question without
becoming a major part of the story?'''
</P>
<P>
   Oppel added: ``We should not be part of the story. Where there's
a clear fox hunt going on, it raises questions about fairness and
the credibility of the press.''
</P>
<P>
   John F. Stacks, an executive editor of Time magazine, framed the
question differently in an essay in this week's issue of the
magazine. ``It's not hard to comprehend a national disinclination,
post-Monica, to paw over the dark moments of yet another
politician's life. The problem is that using cocaine, unlike having
a bit of sport with the ladies, is illegal, and the country has
decided to dole out harsh prison sentences to many people caught
with the drug.''
</P>
<P>
   And, Stacks wrote, ``The rationale for probing has only grown
easier in this post-ideological period, since so many politicians
are essentially saying `Elect me because I'm the better person.' Is
there not then a compelling need to know just how good a person
that politician is?''
</P>
<P>
   And, several journalists noted in interviews, questions by the
news media about rumors about a candidate _ even those planted by
the opposition _ take on a new life in the era of the Internet,
when widely consulted Web sites like The National Journal's Hotline
duly record every question, and late-night joke, about every
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush-cocaine question has bounced around Washington and been
referred to in The Hotline for months, getting front-page treatment
in a Wall Street Journal article in May. The Journal article, which
looked at political rumors and how they arise, said there was no
evidence that the governor had used the drug _ use which would
constitute a felony offense.
</P>
<P>
   The Journal article documented how far the rumor had spread, and
also offered it to a new audience. The cocaine talk continued, but
it did not approach critical mass until Aug. 4.
</P>
<P>
   That morning, Sen. Tom Daschle, D-S.D., the Senate minority
leader, was the guest at a regular Washington breakfast for
journalists. The subject of media inquiries into private lives was
the topic of the day, and Daschle made the point that, compared
with the treatment journalists had given President Clinton, Hillary
Rodham Clinton and Vice President Al Gore, Bush was getting off
easy. A few minutes later, Daschle was asked if it was legitimate
to ask candidates about cocaine use. ``It's a legitimate
question,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At least three reporters came away with the impression that
Daschle was challenging the media to question Bush about cocaine _
although others thought the two comments were unconnected. Daschle
himself denied siccing the news media on Bush. But by the time his
denial was issued, editors of the Daily News in New York had taken
up the challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Daschle threw down the gantlet,'' said Debby Krenek, the News'
editor in chief. Shortly after the breakfast, she and other editors
had decided to ask all 12 presidential candidates about cocaine. An
article by Timothy J. Burger the next day showed the results: 11
denied it, and Bush held to his old response.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, the cocaine question was the centerpiece of the
Fox News Channel's public affairs program ``Hannity &AMP; Colmes,''
which repeated the question about possible cocaine use three times
in teasers before its discussion actually began. Accounts of the
Daschle breakfast were published in The Chicago Tribune, The Omaha
World Herald and papers in every large city in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But the evening news broadcasts were leaving the issue alone, as
were The New York Times and The Los Angeles Times. The Washington
Post had only an Aug. 11 article about the propriety of pressing
the cocaine question.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Friedman, the executive producer of the ABC's ``World News
Tonight,'' said: ``My feeling was there was no proof that the man
had used cocaine, there was no evidence, no one was offering any,
and that he was within his rights to say, `I'm not going to talk
about that.' He has repeatedly said that campaigns ought to be
waged on different ground and that's legitimate.''
</P>
<P>
   But Stuart Wilk, the managing editor of The Dallas Morning News
warns against limiting the reporters' ability to ask questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know that you can ever in mapping out how you're going
to cover a campaign say there are some questions we're never going
to ask,'' Wilk said. ``Circumstances change and circumstances
dictate what questions you are going to ask.''
</P>
<P>
   For Wilk, the results of the News' question changed the
circumstances surrounding the cocaine issue. They changed further
in the next 10 days, as Time magazine printed Stacks' essay and The
New York Times printed a column by Maureen Dowd pointing out that
Bush had opened the door to questions about his personal life by
emphasizing his marital fidelity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to believe he would be so coy about cocaine,'' Ms.
Dowd wrote, ``if he could just say, in a simple declarative
sentence, he had never tried it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dowd column was printed on Wednesday. About the same time,
Wilk said, Scott Parks, a Dallas Morning News reporter, researching
a different issue, found out that the FBI asks some federal
appointees about prior drug use during routine background checks.
He talked to his colleague Sam Attlesey, and they decided this
provided new context for the old question.
</P>
<P>
   On that Wednesday, Bush called a news conference in Austin to
introduce the new Texas commissioner of education. After fielding
questions about education and a political controversy involving the
state funeral commission, he called on Reuters' reporter in Austin,
Hilary Hylton, who began her question with a reference to the
national media's questions about cocaine rumors. Before she could
finish, the governor angrily interrupted, saying the rumors were
``ridiculous and absurd.'' He added, ``Somebody floats a rumor, and
that causes you to ask a question.''
</P>
<P>
   The outburst made the evening news broadcast on CBS, and made
headlines from Atlanta to New York. Then, at a campaign stop later
in the day, Attlesey put the question about security clearance to
Bush, who said he could get clearance, and had not used cocaine in
the last seven years.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday morning, at a campaign stop in Roanoke, Va., the
governor expanded the answer to say that he would have gotten a
security clearance during his father's administration, when the
standard, Bush said, included the prior 15 years. This was
interpreted as a statement that he was denying having used cocaine
since 1974.
</P>
<P>
   By Thursday night, ABC's ``World News Tonight'' and ``NBC
Nightly News,'' which had been among the last holdouts on the
subject, broadcast accounts of the governor's new answers to the
question. The Los Angeles Times gave the issue front-page display
on Friday; The Washington Post gave it top display in an article
that referred to the events as the ``first crisis'' for the
governor's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson Diehl, the Washington Post's assistant managing editor
for national news, said on Friday, ``No one is applying a standard
to Bush that isn't applied to others.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor's new answers did not end the questioning, but
since Friday he has indicated that he will not elaborate further.
And questions about the media's questions also continued.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Lelyveld, the executive editor of The New York Times,
said: ``We have a duty to report these things. But we don't have a
duty, when candidates have given us their answers, to keep
hammering on them to give us other answers.''
</P>
<P>
   Lelyveld added: ``There is here the question of who sets the
agenda _ the politicians or the press. And I think that's a serious
question.''
</P>
<P>
   Marvin Kalb, executive director of the Washington office of
Harvard University's Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics and
Public Policy, said in an interview, ``I do not find similar
passion to ask about the governor's position toward Russia, toward
the Middle East, toward taxation, toward social security.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the rumor mill about Bush continues to churn, with
new mechanisms being developed every day. On Thursday, journalists
at The Associated Press and The Dallas Morning News received
telephone calls purporting to be from a recently appointed
political editor at The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   In each case, the caller said that a freelance journalist was
working on an article that would be damaging to Bush, then
described the supposed particulars in detail.
</P>

   ``He was trying to tell us about the story. He gave me a
synopsis of what the story was,'' said Carole Feldman, the

The Morning News contacted the Times, and were told that no such
telephone calls had been placed.

FEDERAL LAND DEAL PROTECTS YELLOWSTONE HERDS AND GEYSERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mont.)  (js) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The federal government and a New Age church have
completed a deal that will protect bison and geysers in Yellowstone
National Park, President Clinton announced Saturday in his weekly
radio address.
</P>
<P>
   The $13 million deal involves 9,000 acres of land adjacent to
the park. The Carter administration had negotiated over the same
land, the Royal Teton Ranch, in 1980, but the Reagan administration
dropped the deal. In 1981, the Church Universal and Triumphant
bought the property from the publisher Malcolm Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement includes a swap of about 1,000 acres that will
give the church more land near a fallout shelter it maintains. The
church will receive $13 million, which it will use in part for
maintenance of local churches and for a retirement fund for its
founder's widow, Elizabeth Prophet.
</P>
<P>
   The government will get prime wintering territory for bison
along the park's northern edge and rights to underground supplies
of hot water, which, if tapped, might disrupt geysers and hot
springs in the park. In exchange, it gave the church rights to
surface water.
</P>
<P>
   The Yellowstone bison herd of 2,400 is the only one in the
country that is not interbred with cattle, said Michael S. Clark,
the executive director of the Greater Yellowstone Coalition, a
nonprofit group in Bozeman, Mont. Clark said that state employees
had been shooting the animals as they left the park in an effort to
control the bacterial disease brucellosis, which the state said the
bison would pass on to cattle. He said this deal would protect the
animals.
</P>
<P>
   The park is on a 7,000-foot plateau, and the bison, along with
elk and other animals, seek lower elevations with milder climates
in winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a vital piece of private land that we've got a second
chance on,'' Clark said.
</P>
<P>
   A vice president of the church, Murray L. Steinman, said, ``It's
a small land swap but the deal was very complicated because it had
so many different components.''
</P>
<P>
   The land, Steinman said, is ``some of the finest natural habitat
in the United States.'' One phase of the transfer is complete, he
said, and others would follow; for example, the government may buy
and then retire the grazing rights on some church land, to keep
cattle off it.
</P>
<P>
   The church will retain 12 square miles of land in the deal,
Steinman said.
</P>
<P>
   Church officials said in depositions in the early 1990s that
more than 100 firearms and two armored personnel carriers were
stored near the fallout shelter. Steinman, asked about the
catastrophe preparedness, said the weapons were contained in a
16-acre area ``out of thousands and thousands.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like the term `survivalist' as much as `insurance
policy,''' Steinman said.
</P>
<P>
   The president, in an address taped on Nantucket Island, near
where he is vacationing, said, ``With more Americans visiting our
national parks and forests than ever before, we must do more.''
</P>
<P>
   In connection with the radio address, the White House released a
list of dozens of land acquisitions made this year. One is the Weir
Farm, in Wilton, Conn. The only National Historic Site in
Connecticut, it is the former home of J. Alden Weir, the American
Impressionist painter.

DOOMSAYER PUSHES YEAR 2000 PANIC BUTTON WITH OLD DATA 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By BARNABY J. FEDER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   For months, government officials have worried that zealous
pessimists about the world's preparations for Year 2000 computer
problems could stir panic.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to a prominent doomsayer named Jim Lord, they have a
fresh example of what they fear.
</P>
<P>
   Early this month, Lord passed the word that he was about to
break an ``explosive'' Year 2000 computer story. And on Thursday,
the former Navy officer turned Year 2000 author and lecturer
appeared to deliver with an Internet posting he called the
``Pentagon Papers of Y2K.''
</P>
<P>
   Lord put the headline ``Secret Government Study Reveals Massive
Y2K Problems in American Cities'' on his report, which he said was
based on a Navy Department study slipped to him confidentially. His
account claimed that the Navy and the Marine Corps expected more
than 26 million Americans in 125 cities near their installations to
be without water, power, gas or sewer service next January, not to
mention millions of foreign citizens near Navy bases overseas
facing similar plights.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the nation's largest cities, including New York, were on
the list.
</P>
<P>
   It turned out that Lord had indeed received government
information, but that it was outdated.
</P>
<P>
   The document, posted until recently on a public but rarely
visited Navy Internet site, reflected assessments made this spring
by officials on the vulnerability of military installations to
disruptions in basic utilities.
</P>
<P>
   The officials had been instructed to assume the worst _ a
ranking of likely failure _ where they had not received assurances
that Year 2000 problems, the coding glitches that threaten to make
some computers and equipment malfunction, had been addressed.
</P>
<P>
   The newest version of the document, not yet posted on the Navy
site but widely circulated on the Internet in response to Lord's
charges, identifies the status of information-gathering efforts for
the first time as well as the military assessment of the likelihood
of problems. In no case where the military has actually heard from
the utilities are disruptions considered likely.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no indications of likely widespread failures'' of
water, electric, gas or sewer systems, the Navy Department said on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   By then, however, John Koskinen, chairman of the president's
Council on Year 2000 Conversion, was scrambling to shoot down
rumors that Lord's document reflected a truer version of official
views.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a whole set of people out there who would like their
predictions of the end of the world borne out,'' Koskinen said.
</P>
<P>
   He said that as 2000 approaches, the risk of public panic from
exaggerated alarms about the computer glitch would grow.
</P>
<P>
   Several utilities listed by Lord as having problems were swamped
with inquiries following Lord's posting, which was reported by The
Associated Press. Florida Power &AMP; Light was ``astonished'' to find
itself listed as likely to crash in Fort Lauderdale and other areas
it serves, said Bill Swank, a company spokesman. In fact, the power
plant in Fort Lauderdale had already had its computers rolled over
to Year 2000 dates and is performing flawlessly, he said.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Lord said he was not reassured.
</P>
<P>
   In an e-mail on Friday evening, Lord said ``the Navy study
raises many questions not yet addressed,'' including whether there
were similar Army and Air Force documents and what criteria were
used to make the assessments.

NEW FACES AT THE TABLE FOR THE TITLE IN TOP CHESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ROBERT BYRNE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The gathering of attention among chess devotees that accompanies
the start of any world championship match, either at the site of
play or at computer terminals around the world, was under way in
earnest Saturday as the title match of the International Chess
Federation went through final preparations for its opening Sunday
evening at Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   After a month of qualifying matches, many of them featuring
bruising, sometimes dazzling play, two finalists have emerged,
Aleksandr Khalifman of Russia and Vladimir Akopian of Armenia, who
are not well known outside the tournament circuit but who both
performed brilliantly in the preliminaries.
</P>
<P>
   A salient feature of this year's championship is the absence of
celebrities. Garry Kasparov, universally regarded as the world's
strongest grandmaster despite his humiliating loss two years ago to
the IBM supercomputer Deep Blue, is boycotting the federation
(known by its French acronym, FIDE) and trying to organize a match
of his own with Viswanathan Anand of India, who also passed up the
Las Vegas event.
</P>
<P>
   Anatoly Karpov, the present FIDE champion, is sitting out the
series as well, unhappy that he was not seeded into the finals.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, as a result of a tough, unforgiving knockout format
that did not recognize star power, several other stars _ among them
Vladimir Kramnik of Russia, Alexei Shirov of Spain and Michael
Adams of Britain _ were unexpectedly and unceremoniously brushed
aside during the preliminaries. They played as though they were
overconfident, overreaching on attack and wilting under the
imaginative counterattacks sprung on them by their hungry,
up-and-coming opponents.
</P>
<P>
   The shortness of the elimination matches, only two games before
a high-speed tiebreaker, increased everyone's anxiety. Losing a
single game often let an opponent win by playing conservatively for
a draw in the next game. This system is a far cry from the lengthy
championship matches that were the rule years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But that classical format, in which games were adjourned after
five hours and resumed the next morning, could not be continued
with today's lightning-quick computers to assist overnight
analysis. The present system keeps the human element uppermost.
</P>
<P>
   Akopian, a 27-year-old former world junior champion, emphasizes
positional play, somewhat in the manner of his illustrious Armenian
predecessor, Tigran Petrosion. Creating tentacles of pawns around
his opponent, Akopian often holds back his attack until his prey is
totally imprisoned, then pounces with devastating effect.
</P>
<P>
   Khalifman, 33, is forceful but not a gambler. He will aim for
open positions in which the play of the pieces dominates the
outcome. The sudden sword strike, taking the opponent by surprise,
either winning at once or creating a whole series of blows, is his
method. If he senses a tentacle coming his way, he must cut if off
at once.
</P>
<P>
   The FIDE series, then, is the debut on the championship stage of
two new, relatively unheralded cast members. Does that mean the
event is a disappointment before it starts? Hardly, for it is an
opportunity to watch ambitious, talented players try to prove
themselves under the pressure of high-stakes play.
</P>
<P>
   The games, which begin at 6 p.m. EDT, can be followed at
www.uschess.org.

EDITORIAL: AS THE TOLL IN TURKEY RISES 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, Aug. 22:
</P>
<P>
   It is impossible to grasp the emotional and civil weight of the
death count in Turkey even at present numbers, much less at the
numbers some observers are predicting _ perhaps as many as 40,000
dead. That estimate, if reached, would place this earthquake in the
same category as those that struck Soviet Armenia in 1988, killing
25,000, and Iran in 1990, killing 40,000. The only equivalent for
so much destruction in lives and material in such a short time is
the 20th-century battlefield, and it is one of the premises of
civilized existence, especially in America, that all but those who
have been to war _ a small fraction of society at any time _ should
find the conditions of the battlefield unimaginable.
</P>
<P>
   The Johnstown flood in 1889 and the Galveston hurricane in 1900
are still bywords in this country. Some 2,200 people died in the
flood, 6,000 in the hurricane. There is simply no analogy in recent
American experience that allows our imagination to penetrate the
dimensions of Turkey's suffering. The Turks cannot have fully
grasped it yet themselves.
</P>
<P>
   A number of wholly incommensurate thoughts do occur, though. It
is hard to read the articles or watch the news reports from Turkey
without reflecting on the intricacy and, ultimately, the delicacy
of the interwoven systems, as well as the habits of mind and
behavior, that make up a society. There is water, electricity,
communication, the layout of buildings in the urban grid, political
power, social services, economic interchange, friendship, family.
In the sudden landscape that followed last week's earthquake, all
of that came crashing down, revealing instantly, tragically, what a
lustrous, infinite web ordinary life really is.
</P>
<P>
   It is worth noticing, too, how hard it is to restore any part of
that web from outside. Rescuers have streamed into the cities of
western Turkey only to discover that they are without civil
coherence themselves, much less capable of providing it to the
immediate victims of the quake. Civilization is more local, more
organic, than we tend to remember on this furiously globalizing
planet.
</P>
<P>
   For years to come, researchers will be trying to distinguish
what was natural in this earthquake _ the shock and aftershocks
themselves, a certain inevitable minimum of death in an earthquake
of this scale _ from what was artificial. Death was compounded many
times over by bad construction and violations of building-code
provisions meant to mitigate the effects of earthquakes. It was
compounded still further by an extraordinary lack of disaster
preparation, extraordinary not least of all because Turkey is such
a seismically active region with long experience of crippling
earthquakes. The chaos that has characterized the response to this
disaster suggests that though the popular will is strong, political
will may be one of the things that collapsed last Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   The staggering death toll in Turkey may lead some people to
conclude that there is no preparing for a force as abrupt and
unpredictable as a major earthquake, that nature, in some forms, is
simply insuperable and human means inadequate. That would be the
wrong conclusion. It is not a question of stopping earthquakes or
preventing death altogether. It is a question of preventing
needless death, of keeping a city from killing itself when an
earthquake strikes. Nature may be insuperable in some forms, but
human neglect is not.

EDITORIAL: MAKING A TRANSIT WISH LIST REAL 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, Aug. 22:
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who lives or works in New York City probably has some
suggestions for what the Metropolitan Transportation Authority
should include in its next five-year building plan. The MTA will
not announce its decisions until October, but it seems committed to
construction of a tunnel connecting the Long Island Rail Road to
Grand Central Terminal. The project, strongly supported by Gov.
George Pataki, would give commuters the option of arriving in
Manhattan on the east side rather than going on to Pennsylvania
Station on the west. But mass-transit advocates say that project
must be coupled with construction of the long-delayed Second Avenue
subway, to relieve overcrowding on the already jammed Lexington
Avenue line.
</P>
<P>
   There is actually not much debate about the value of both
projects, but the MTA chokes on the price tag _ $4 billion for the
LIRR project, including new railroad cars, and $10 billion to $15
billion for the subway, which now exists only as sections of
abandoned tunnel in Harlem. The city's Independent Budget Office
recently questioned whether the MTA, despite recent surpluses, has
the capacity to pay for any major building projects at all without
new sources of money.
</P>
<P>
   To the dismay of mass-transit advocates, the MTA has announced
that it will consider only the option of building a section of the
Second Avenue subway line, from 125th Street to 63rd Street, where
it would connect to the N and R lines. That would be no help to the
thousands of additional commuters coming into Grand Central
Terminal from the new LIRR tunnel, although it might divert some
Upper East Side residents to the N and R lines before they got to
midtown, freeing up space for new riders.
</P>
<P>
   The mass-transit advocates are right about the long-term
importance of a full Second Avenue subway line. The city has been
working hard to keep the major stock exchanges in the financial
district and to spur residential development and new uses for older
office buildings in lower Manhattan. But the potential job growth
will be stunted if the people who live and work there are unable to
get to other parts of the city and the suburbs. Once completed, the
Second Avenue line could be the basis for a major expansion of the
region's entire mass-transit system, as the Regional Plan
Association demonstrated in an imaginative report released earlier
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Over the short term, the MTA plan may be adequate. In the
real-life world of public works, there is no reason that a
truncated Second Avenue subway line could not be the beginning of
the mass-transit advocates' larger goal, particularly if the
suburban commuters dumped off at Grand Central eventually joined
city subway riders in demanding it.
</P>
<P>
   The real issue is one of long-term vision. The current MTA,
which is controlled by Pataki, tends to accept whatever financing
the state provides and then make its plans accordingly. It needs to
be more aggressive, to come up with a capital plan that
acknowledges that the city cannot create new jobs without expanded
transportation services. Once the MTA is committed in principle to
a project like the Second Avenue line, it will be in a stronger
position to lobby the city and state for money to finance it.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Those archangels of the arena, Michael, John, Wayne
and Steffi, flew away this year, and I hardly thought about them.
All I could muster was: gone now, too bad, nice people, played
good.
</P>
<P>
   And then they all floated out of my consciousness until Jordan
appeared with his cartoon friends in a television commercial for a
telephone service. Was it a message from Michael, was I supposed to
call? Show that I missed him by subscribing? Can it wait until all
four are snug in their Halls of Fame, and I see who has replaced
them?
</P>
<P>
   We love you, honey, but the season's over. These are the days of
fungible heroes. Get them off the field before they turn clumsy or
embarrass us with behavior unbecoming. And if possible, pack them
away, to be opened only on ceremonial occasions. (Ty Cobb, Joe
Louis and Lawrence Taylor did nothing positive for their legends
after retirement.)
</P>
<P>
   These fab four left on top, although Gretzky, who was only
intermittently Great lately, was two franchises removed from
skating for a winner. All four were driven, hard-working
perfectionists who gave us our money's worth, the kind of
consummate professionals you want managing your portfolio or
defending you in court.
</P>
<P>
   Yet none of them quite grabbed at our hearts or elbowed our
ribs. They worked so hard, they didn't seem to be having fun. It
ultimately mocks our fandom, our heroes burning out to entertain
us. Or have they long lost that old conceit of loving the game so
much that they would play it for free, or least for only $2 million
a year?
</P>
<P>
   Steffi started so early as a pro, at 13, that burning out at 30
seems like a long career. Seventeen years, and they were not always
easy ones; Despite a cheesecookie pose in a Sports Illustrated
swimsuit issue, she never seemed much more than a tennis machine,
dedicated and distant.
</P>
<P>
   Her father's imprisonment for misrepresenting her $20 million in
prize money to German tax authorities was not particularly
endearing. Nor was her lack of public sympathy toward Monica Seles,
who was stabbed on court in 1993 by a self-described Graf fan. The
crime, barely punished, allowed Steffi to regain her No. 1 ranking
over Monica's body. A classy or human Steffi would have refused the
ranking. But then, a classy or human Michael would have stepped up
in some way to deal with Nike's exploitation of Asian workers, Air
Jordan profits over their bodies. Are we asking too much?
</P>
<P>
   Pee Wee Reese, who died last week, was not on any of the
millennial lists that most, if not all, of the fab four will make,
yet he will be remembered longer than any of them for just one
powerful, historical gesture. Ragged by an opposing team as an
apostate Confederate for playing with a black teammate, the
Dodgers' shortstop made sure the entire ball park saw him put his
hand on Jackie Robinson's shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Such opportunities don't always come with the schedule, but they
do exist. In a time of terror and violence, Derek Jeter's little
peace mission should have got a mini-Nobel. While the Yankees and
Mariners were recently in a typically senseless beanball brawl
(were the umpires on strike already?), Jeter chatted amiably with
his Seattle friend Alex Rodriguez. At least one teammate and some
fans questioned his loyalty. Maybe next time he should bring a gun
to the game.
</P>
<P>
   Some athletes are thrust into roles as examples. I do not
believe that Lance Armstrong contracted testicular cancer as a
career move, although no athlete's triumph has moved me as much in
recent years. A testicular cancer patient myself, I went right out
and bought the first new bicycle I have owned since I rode a red
Schwinn delivering telegrams for Western Union.
</P>
<P>
   This one's a beautiful silver hybrid, and I change gears
constantly, every molehill the mountains of the Tour de France. I
can imagine my carcinoma sisters running harder, thinking about
Lyudmila Engquist jumping hurdles after chemo for breast cancer. I
will be happy to never meet Armstrong or Engquist, lest the real
people disturb the symbols. Perhaps it should be thus for Michael,
John, Wayne and Steffi.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the most interesting and important athletes of our time
_ Billie Jean King, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Jim Brown _ have not
always got their due, perhaps because we think we know them.
Muhammad Ali has got too much too late, often for the same reason,
which has less to do with his magnificent achievements than our
interpretations.
</P>
<P>
   Joe DiMaggio, who died this year to often mawkish eulogies and
overwrought sociology, was an ancestor of the current four: driven,
selfish, unidimensional in his playing days. It was not until after
he married and divorced Marilyn Monroe that we began to see him as
something more than a performer, and it was not until after her
death that we were taken by his strength and courtliness. We then
invested his playing career with a hidden passion we hadn't always
seen.
</P>
<P>
   So there's still time for Steffi, Wayne, John and Michael. And
for Barry Sanders, the Detroit Lions' running back who may very
well unretire if they get him the team he feels he deserves. And,
of course, Tiger Woods.
</P>
<P>
   Remember him? The Lion King's cub? Two years ago, we were told
that Babe Ruth was the Tiger Woods of his time, that golf would
save the developing world, that Tiger would change sports marketing
and race relations.
</P>
<P>
   Well, he's moving right along. Last week, he finally won his
second major tournament. He was chased all the way by one Sergio
Garcia of Spain, who is 19. How do you buy that boy's stock?

landed once again in the Little League World Series, a handful of
fathers, members of the Toms River East Little League board,
huddled over a long table at the league's headquarters and planned
another parade down Main Street.
</P>
<P>
   If the team of mostly 12-year-olds returns victorious from
Williamsport, Pa., where the series begins on Sunday, the world
title will be its second in a row, but it will be no less exciting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was telling someone yesterday that winning the series last
year was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,'' said Kevin Fox, a vice
president of the board who is trying to raise $70,000 for a bronze
sculpture of a ballplayer with his coach to commemorate last year's
victory. ``But I guess we're going to break that old saying.''
</P>
<P>
   As he spoke, Fox stood inside the league's new $150,000 indoor
practice center with batting cages, pitching areas and televisions
to show videos during clinics. It was built with donations to allow
for training in the winter.
</P>
<P>
   With its 3-0 victory over Middleboro, Mass., on Thursday, Toms
River became just the third team in the United States to return to
the Little League World Series the year after winning the title.
Lock Haven, Pa., did so in 1948-49, and Long Beach, Calif., did in
1992-93.
</P>
<P>
   To say that people in this Ocean County community were jubilant
would be an understatement. On Thursday night, hundreds of people
crowded into Mugsy's, a sports bar on Hooper Avenue, to watch the
game on ESPN. Those who did not find room here watched it at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just incredible,'' said Anthony Baiamonte, owner of
Mugsy's, which calls itself the unofficial headquarters of the
team. ``We need some new adjectives _ that's how good these kids
are.''
</P>
<P>
   No one could explain what it is about Toms River, a suburb that
is part of Dover Township, a community of 90,000, that produced
winners two years in a row.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it's the water,'' Chuck Friesema, an electrician who was
having a drink at Mugsy's, said about Toms River, which until last
year was best known as the possible site of a cancer cluster. ``I
don't know if it's the kids who take it more seriously here, or if
it's the coaching, and the parents just enjoy doing it and living
vicariously through the kids,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor of Dover Township, Raymond P. Fox (no relation to
Kevin, the board vice president), had another explanation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just great people, and a great town,'' he said at his
office in the township hall, where pictures of last year's victory
are plastered along the hallways. ``Certainly our Little League
organizations are the best around. And our schools, too. The Toms
River regional school system is one of the best in the state.''
</P>
<P>
   Baseball is definitely a big deal here, but so are other sports,
the mayor pointed out. There are two leagues here, Toms River with
600 players, and Toms River East, with 1,200, which is sending a
team of its all-stars to the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   The town's soccer leagues actually have more players, and there
is also a girls' softball league, a Pop Warner football league and
Biddy Basketball.
</P>
<P>
   But obviously, Little League is king right now. The Toms River
East Little League, with headquarters on Windsor Avenue, has an
annual budget of $200,000.
</P>
<P>
   The fields here look like those tucked into a thousand other
suburban communities, but the grass seems lusher and some of the
fields are lighted for nighttime play. The indoor center opened in
February.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to have this if we're going to compete against teams
from California and Puerto Rico who can play all year long,'' said
Fox, the Little League board member, who is also a United Airlines
pilot. ``The season here only runs from June, when practice begins,
to late August, if the teams make the finals.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, the Town Council donated a four-acre parcel to the
league to expand its playing area.
</P>
<P>
   Fox and Stan Benisz, another board member, conceded that some of
the parents might be living vicariously through their sons and
daughters. But the team could not succeed without the parents, who
volunteer to fill every job from coaching to managing the
concession stands.
</P>
<P>
   Some parents take leaves of absence from their jobs to follow
the children around, said Benisz, who said it is not uncommon for
some parents on the board to put in 500 or 600 hours a year on team
business.
</P>
<P>
   It is all worth it, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of last year we kept saying to ourselves: `How are you
going to top this? How are we going to top this?''' said Gary
Goldsack, president of the league board. ``Well, we just found out
how.''
</P>
<P>
   In Williamsport, where the team will play Phenix City, Ala., on
Sunday at 6 p.m., Mike Gaynor, manager of the Toms River East
Americans Little League team, was reflecting on what made his team
a winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got good players,'' he said. ``They've done a nice job. When
we needed to win, we found a way to win. I guess I'm doing
something right.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think any time you have a Little League team with
12-year-olds, as much talent as you have, you never know how the
kids are going to handle the pressure. You really don't learn the
chemistry until you start playing. And hopefully, you're not losing
games in the meantime before you find out what you need.''
</P>
<P>
   What captures the imagination of the townspeople is that the
boys are so young, and they play with such fervor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids are psyched,'' said Darren Lardieri, who has a
woodworking business here and has been following the team, even
though he has no children on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not thinking about whether they get hurt or their
contracts, like the professional athletes are. These kids, they'll
take the chance. They'll do what it takes to win. It makes the
whole game nicer.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, when the Little Leaguers won the World Series,
townspeople by the thousands lined up along Route 37, one of the
community's main thoroughfares, from the Garden State Parkway to
downtown. Route 37 had to be closed for a few hours. A few days
later, the town held an official parade for them.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the team and the township leaders are planning only
one parade, on the day the players return from the finals in
Williamsport, whether they win or not.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt about it,'' the Mayor said. ``Win, lose or
draw, they're champions anyway, as far as we're concerned.''

EDITORIAL OBSERVER: A DEBATE OVER WEALTH, VIRTUE AND JUSTICE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By STEVEN R. WEISMAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the weeks since Congress passed a tax cut that would be the
biggest since the Reagan era if enacted, Republicans have had a
tough time selling the issue politically. President Clinton's
threat to veto the $792 billion tax bill was hardly mentioned at
the recent Iowa straw poll. But the debate among those talking
about the tax cut is revealing. It suggests that class conflict
continues to play a role in American politics, and that politicians
may have to be sensitive to widespread resentment toward those who
have benefited the most from boom times.
</P>
<P>
   Tax-cut advocates are at their most awkward when addressing the
fact that the tax cut showers its benefits on the rich. Their
argument is that, after all, the rich pay the most taxes and thus
should get the most out of a tax cut. ``Heaven forbid somebody
making $500,000 is going to get a greater benefit than somebody
making $10,000,'' Sen. Don Nickles of Oklahoma declared
sarcastically when the bill passed earlier this month. The
conservative National Review asserts that the bill ``cuts
Americans' taxes in roughly the proportion that they bear the tax
burden.'' The magazine adds: ``No, poor people don't get an
income-tax cut in this bill. But then, poor people don't pay
federal income tax.''
</P>
<P>
   That is a misleading formulation because the income tax accounts
for only about half of federal tax revenues. Americans of modest
means may pay little income tax, but they pay heavily with payroll
deductions for Social Security and Medicare, two programs that
Democrats note face insolvency unless the budget surplus is
diverted to shore them up instead of being used to provide tax
relief.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, the Republican tax cut distributes its benefits
disproportionately to the rich, making the tax system less
progressive than it is now. The tax cut is actually an amalgamation
of a 1 percent cut in the income tax rate and additional tax breaks
for student loans, capital gains, estates, health costs and other
expenses. According to the Treasury Department, the wealthiest 20
percent of American taxpayers earn 49 percent of the nation's total
income and pay 59 percent of American taxes, which is logical given
the progressive nature of the tax system. This top tier of earners
would, however, receive 78 percent of the money from the tax cut.
Similarly, the top 1 percent of Americans earn 14 percent of the
nation's income and pay 19 percent of the taxes. But they would get
24 percent of the tax cut money. That is hardly returning their
proportionate share.
</P>
<P>
   Debates about taxes almost always start with who-gets-what and
then jump to larger issues. At what point, for example, do higher
taxes imposed on the rich discourage people from trying to get
rich?
</P>
<P>
   Many tax-cut advocates argue that the progressive income tax is
inherently unfair because it is unjust to punish the energy, hard
work and risk-taking that yield higher incomes. In its most
exaggerated form, the argument is the one advanced by Alan Keyes,
an African-American who is running way behind for the Republican
presidential nomination. He calls the progressive income tax a form
of slavery. Many other politicians join with Steve Forbes in
supporting a flat tax that would eliminate the idea of
progressivity, which has been around since the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   The argument in favor of tax progressivity is that the rich have
a greater ability to pay, and that they benefit the most from
society's blessings and sound government. People who favor higher
taxes for the rich also tend to view wealth as less a matter of
virtuous behavior than the arbitrary nature of life. In this view,
progressivity is not so much to punish the rich as to lessen some
of the unfairness in the way wealth is distributed.
</P>
<P>
   The final argument for a tax cut is that the revenue collected
by the government ``belongs'' to the taxpayer and should be
returned when there is a surplus. But the national debt also
``belongs'' to the taxpayers. So does the obligation to keep Social
Security and Medicare solvent, educate the next generation,
preserve the environment and carry out other government services.
The more that Americans see the debate in these terms, the greater
the chance that they will continue to reject a big tax cut geared
to the wealthy.

ANGRY WORDS FLUTTER OVER DIXIE  
 FOR VENTURA, ONE HOUSE WILL DO  
 JOSEPH KENNEDY INVESTS WISELY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: S.C., Minn., Neb., Mass.)  (mk) 
 By B. DRUMMOND AYRES JR.    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In South Carolina, where the Civil War started and sometimes
seems never to have quite ended, the fighting has flared up again.
</P>
<P>
   This time, as so often in recent decades, the issue is the
Confederate flag. A hundred thirty-four years after Appomattox, it
still flies over the Capitol dome in Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   Blacks and many New South Southerners see that as a gratuitous
insult. Old South Southerners tend to see it as heritage on parade
and, in some lingering cases, as defiance.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the NAACP called for an economic boycott of
South Carolina, beginning next January, to force the state to
remove the flag. Some organizations planning to hold conventions in
the state have since canceled them even though the boycott has not
officially begun.
</P>
<P>
   But the flag nevertheless has stayed up. Only the state
Legislature can order its removal, and so far a majority of its
members have not been moved by a few convention cancellations.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes Dick Harpootlian, the chairman of the South Carolina
Democratic Party and a flag opponent, with a plan he contends will
break the impasse.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic legislators who want to keep the flag up, he says,
should be singled out for defeat by the party in next year's
primary elections. Without Democratic votes, he argues, Republicans
in the Legislature _ they are the flag's staunchest supporters _
could not muster enough votes to keep it flying.
</P>
<P>
   ``This ought to be the litmus test for candidates,'' he told the
party's executive committee last week. ``We'll take them
individually and beat them. We see the enemy and it is us.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats countered that the enemy was, in fact, ``us'' _
one Dick Harpootlian.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Geddings, the chief of staff to Gov. Jim Hodges, a
Democrat, accused Harpootlian of irresponsible ``political
hyperbole.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This doesn't get us anywhere near a compromise that someday
will bring the flag down,'' Geddings said, alluding to efforts by
the governor to find a middle ground in the flag fight, perhaps by
moving it to a memorial park.
</P>
<P>
   The governor has been working on the issue since the day he took
office, having won election last year when the incumbent
Republican, David Beasley, lost a bid for a second term after
running afoul of both flag proponents and opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Harpootlian, always outspoken, always politically testy, always
spoiling for a fight, said that his only interest was keeping the
party on a course true to its core beliefs and a course that would
build up the party after years of decline.
</P>
<P>
   That was not good enough for state Rep. Marion Carnell of
Greenwood County, one of the pro-flag Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to destroy an already weakened party,'' Carnell
warned.
</P>
<P>
   But it was more than good enough for Republican leaders. They
invited threatened Democrats to join the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura's Mission: Turning Two Into One
</P>
<P>
   Jesse Ventura says he is tired of talking about whether he would
rather be president than governor of Minnesota. So he is spreading
the word that for the foreseeable future he will grant interviews
only to reporters who want to ask him about his latest Gopher State
project.
</P>
<P>
   Like the governor, it's no ordinary project.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura proposes combining Minnesota's 134-seat House and
67-seat Senate into a single, smaller, 135-seat legislative body in
which candidates would run for office without party labels.
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska is the only one of the 50 states that has a unicameral,
or one-house, legislative system. Members also run without party
labels.
</P>
<P>
   As Ventura sees things, the bicameral, or two-house, system of
legislating is gummed up with partisan bickering and, worst of all,
allows legislators to duck accountability by saying that
shortcomings were caused by members of the other house. He wants
the current two-house Legislature in Minnesota to authorize a
statewide vote next year on whether to rewrite the state's
constitution and shift to a unicameral system.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're at a pivotal point,'' he declared last week as he
barnstormed the state to promote his idea. ``The people aren't
satisfied with politics as usual.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, old professional wrestler that he is, he flexed some
muscle, got up into some faces and warned that he would work hard
against any legislators who resisted putting 66 legislative jobs on
the chopping block, their own in many cases.
</P>
<P>
   Other governors have fought this fight without success, both in
Minnesota and several other states. Should Ventura succeed,
Minnesota would see the biggest structural change in its government
since it joined the Union in 1858.
</P>
<P>
   Don't count out Ventura, the Reform Party's highest-ranking
elected official, on this far-reaching reform. Minnesotans like
their politics different, even quirky, Ventura being living proof.
Besides, he has powerful allies in the fight, among them the House
speaker, Steve Sviggum of Kenyon.
</P>
<P>
   Sviggum says he would be comfortable running for a seat in a
single-house legislature and, he adds, he especially likes the idea
of campaigning not as a member of any party (he's a Republican) but
``as the individual _ who you are, what your principles are, what
you stand for.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the powerful opponents of the Ventura proposal is the
Senate majority leader, Roger Moe, a member of the
Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party from Erskine. Also in the fight is a
newly organized bipartisan group of lobbyists, lawyers, legislators
and former legislators that calls itself OUCH, as in Opponents of a
Unicameral House.
</P>
<P>
   The group's founder, state Rep. Dave Bishop of Rochester, a
Republican, contends a unicameral legislature would not have as
much healthy give and take as a bicameral legislature and would
concentrate power in the hands of just a few members. He says his
side faces a particularly tough battle because the state's most
outspoken political leader, Ventura, is leading the charge from the
other side.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Jesse,'' he laments, ``it's got legs.''
</P>
<P>
   A Campaign Fund Keeps Growing
</P>
<P>
   When Rep. Joseph Kennedy II of Massachusetts retired last year
and returned to his nonprofit company, which distributes cheap
heating oil to the poor, he had $1.4 million in his re-election
campaign fund, an impressive amount for a House member. Under
campaign finance rules, he could have given the money to charity,
used it to help elect other Democrats or salted it away for some
future charitable or political use.
</P>
<P>
   He chose to salt it away, raising speculation anew that sooner
or later he might get back into politics, maybe to run for
governor.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever.
</P>
<P>
   This much is already clear: Like the Kennedy he is named for,
former Rep. Kennedy knows how to make a buck, or at least how to
find someone who can make a buck for him.
</P>
<P>
   He handed the $1.4 million over to a Massachusetts investment
manager, who, according to The Boston Herald, put it into a mixed
portfolio of stocks, bonds and Treasury bills and in the first six
months of this year increased its value by more than 30 percent, to
$1.85 million.
</P>
<P>
   In that same period, the Standard &AMP; Poor's index of 500 popular
stocks, a major market measure, rose about 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, campaign funds are invested in certificates of deposit
to minimize risk. The return on them is typically around 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The rich get richer....

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Shards of broken beer bottles pop beneath their feet
as players from the Dark Side, a recreation-league softball team in
the Bronx, mill about their bench early on an August Sunday. Their
field is a concrete blacktop enclosed by a 12-foot chain-link
fence, base markings painted on the pavement, the only grass in
sight a few weeds poking through the cracks. As Mike Marchena
watches his teammate George Carrion, the shortstop, he can't help
but wonder, ``Man, what are you doing here?''
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, Carrion was one of the best high school baseball
prospects to come out of New York in 20 years, a hard-throwing
pitcher and power-hitting shortstop from the Bronx's De Witt
Clinton High. After one season at a Texas junior college, the Texas
Rangers signed him to a contract with a $700,000 bonus to play in
their minor league system.
</P>
<P>
   Yet last summer, Carrion abruptly quit. He bolted from the
Rangers with neither warning nor explanation, drove home to Yonkers
(where he had bought his family a five-bedroom house) and has been,
in his words, ``just hanging out with buddies'' ever since. The
22-year-old Carrion sleeps till noon most days, goes to nightclubs
on weekends and, five or six times a week, plays rec-league
softball for a half-dozen teams around the Bronx. His mother,
Margie Carrion, said recently, ``Not a day goes by when I don't
want to strangle that kid.''
</P>
<P>
   Blithely explaining that ``I wasn't having fun anymore'' with
the Rangers, Carrion said he might want to return to pro ball
someday, but Texas officials, already taken for that $700,000, said
they would be very reluctant to have him back. Meanwhile, he lives
off what's left of the bonus money. Recent purchases include a new,
loaded Lexus for $40,000, a mammoth diamond crucifix necklace
(``just for the fashion'') and a cell phone that rings the 1812
Overture.
</P>
<P>
   Almost daily, Carrion watches baseball highlights on the
television in his basement bedroom and comes across a former minor
league teammate or opponent who has reached the big leagues. Dozens
of empty rum, tequila and beer bottles, sharing his shelves with
his youth-league baseball trophies, form an eerie skyline as they
ring the room.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Rangers consider George Carrion a good-natured kid who
wouldn't hurt anyone _ except maybe himself. A true bonus baby.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of feel sorry for him,'' said Reid Nichols, the
Rangers' director of player development. ``There's a million people
who would love to trade places with him and be in his position to
have a chance to play in the big leagues. And he turned his back on
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The $700,000 bonus, in many ways, sabotaged Carrion's career
from the start. The Rangers paid him that much in part to get him
to give up shortstop _ a position at which they believed he had no
major league promise _ and to focus on pitching, where his
97-mile-an-hour fastball made him a potential ace. The two sides
agreed that Carrion would pitch full time while getting 50 at-bats
a month during the 1996 and 1997 seasons, after which he would
pitch only.
</P>
<P>
   His first summer at Port Charlotte in the rookie-level Gulf
Coast League, Carrion performed well on the mound (a 2-0 record and
1.76 ERA) and at the plate (a .309 batting average) but complained
of shoulder pain in August. He later had surgery for a torn labrum.
He struggled the following season at rookie-level Pulaski in the
Appalachian League, posting a 4.74 ERA and .198 batting average,
and last year he was miserable during his first summer of pitching
exclusively.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lost my love for it because I wasn't playing every day,''
Carrion said this month. ``I wasn't having fun pitching and sitting
on the bench.''
</P>
<P>
   When he is hitting, ``I know I can mess up one day and the next
day go out there and make up for it,'' he said. ``Pitching, you get
lit up one night, you got to wait four more nights to go out there
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Compounding Carrion's malaise were the deaths of two close
family members. His great-grandfather died in May 1996 while George
was playing in the Junior College World Series, and the following
April, his cousin and best friend, Louie Lebron, was killed in an
automobile accident. His mother recalled Carrion saying, ``Every
time I go away, something happens.''
</P>
<P>
   On June 18 of last year, Carrion had a 5-5 record and a 5.65 ERA
for the Class A Savannah Sand Gnats when he yielded 10 runs in just
two-thirds of an inning against the Augusta Greenjackets. He
trudged to the clubhouse, iced his shoulder on a couch and pondered
the worst outing of his career. ``I went out there and I had
nothin','' he said. ``I just got lit up. I don't know, I just
didn't want to sit on the bench for four more days thinking about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   When Carrion's roommate and closest friend on the team, Emar
Fleming, later found Carrion's belongings cleared out of their
hotel room, he pounded on the door of manager Paul Carey. Both
feared Carrion might have committed suicide. Only after enlisting
the help of the Augusta, Ga., police did they learn that Carrion
had paid a local taxi company $200 to drive him three hours back to
Savannah, where he packed the rest of his things and began driving
to New York, crying for much of the trip.
</P>
<P>
   He rang the doorbell in Yonkers at 4:30 the following morning.
His stepfather, Michael O'Farrell, recalled having the following
exchange:
</P>
<P>
   ``What the hell are you doing here?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I quit.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you mean, you quit?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not happy with it no more.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You're kidding me, right?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ever since then,'' O'Farrell said, ``here he is.''
</P>
<P>
   Carrion has had almost no contact with the Rangers since. Last
September, he agreed by telephone to pitch in the team's fall
instructional league program, but he did not show up. Legally, he
can keep the bonus money, and when asked whether he will return any
of it, he laughed and responded, ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   Carey, the Savannah manager, believes that Carrion could have
made far more than $700,000 had he stayed with the team. ``He was
getting his strength back,'' Carey said recently. ``I think he
could have been a successful big leaguer _ at least a million
dollars a year.'' The Mets' assistant general manager, Omar Minaya,
who scouted Carrion in high school for the Rangers, remembered
Carrion's talent as being similar to that of ``a young Pedro
Martinez.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Carrion is living at home with no plan to go to school
or get a job. ``Someday it'll come to that,'' he said, relaxing on
one of his room's leather couches. ``Go out there, have to find a
9-to-5 or something.'' His stepfather, who sells subway tokens at
the nearby Fordham Road station, has given up trying to guide him.
``You can't babysit him all his life,'' O'Farrell said. ``He comes
up with all different excuses, and I say, `All right, that's your
decision, that's your choice, but 10 years down the line I don't
want to hear you going, when you've got that dreary job doing
nothing, `That could have been me, that could have been me.' ''

<P>
   Carrion once showed tremendous commitment to baseball. In his
teens, when he lived at 198th Street and Grand Concourse in the
Bronx, he rode the D train an hour to Brooklyn every day to play in
the Youth Service League, whose alumni include Manny Ramirez,
Shawon Dunston and seven other major league players. Carrion woke
up at 6 a.m. on weekends and went every day after school to play as
many games as he could. His mitt had the words ``Hard Work,''
``Think'' and ``Dedication'' written on the leather.
</P>
<P>
   He gave a professional career little mind, instead letting the
Youth Service League's director, Mel Zitter, become his negotiator
when major league scouts came calling. The Rangers selected Carrion
in the seventh round of the 1995 amateur draft and offered him
$100,000; Zitter persuaded him to attend Northeast Texas Community
College for one year to live away from home before turning pro.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Rigby, a Rangers scout, had a year, until midnight the
following June 3, to sign Carrion before the team lost his rights.
At 10:30 that night Rigby negotiated the $700,000 bonus with
Zitter. But when Zitter phoned Carrion to arrange a formal signing
to beat the deadline, he wasn't home. He was ``hanging out on the
street, where I was born and raised,'' Carrion recalled with a
proud smile.
</P>
<P>
   When Carrion returned at 11, he called Zitter, who hastily drove
to the Bronx, scooped up Carrion and drove him to a Ramada Inn in
Queens, where the contract was signed at 11:50 p.m. Rangers general
manager Doug Melvin declared at the time, ``The one thing about him
is we're getting another player who loves to play.''
</P>
<P>
   Zitter and Carrion, once as close as father and son, no longer
speak. Carrion declined to comment on why. Zitter said:
``Apparently, he doesn't want to talk to me. I think he knows if he
talked to me, I'll try to talk him into going back.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``Inner city kids bring something to the table that
other kids don't, emotionally. They have a desire to compete, for
competition. But they have lags as far as dealing with discipline
and trusting people. Kids from the city, in many ways they're a lot
older than they are, and in many ways younger than they are.''
</P>
<P>
   Fleming, who speaks with Carrion every few weeks, said that
Carrion has told him he wants to return to the Rangers. Carrion
said that maybe he would call them someday. But Nichols said he
would not necessarily welcome him back: ``I think I would be very
guarded. I don't think he'll play for us again.'' The Rangers, for
fear he will sign with another team, will also not release Carrion
from his contract.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Carrion continues to play softball. He helped his
Dark Side team reach its rec-league championship series, showing a
strong arm at shortstop and power at the plate. ``I'm happy to have
him on the team,'' right fielder Josh Hollander said. ``Hey, it
worked out well for us.'' Carrion does not keep track of his
batting average and said he preferred it that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day I tell him: `Why can't you go back? Why don't you go
back?' '' Margie Carrion said, shaking her head. ``Especially when
I see him getting up to play softball at 7 o'clock on weekends.
`Why can you go play softball and not baseball?' He doesn't want to
talk about it. I'm just hoping he doesn't wake up and it's too
late.''
</P>
<P>
   Said George, with his ever-present grin: ``You only live once.
We'll see what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, outside the house, Carrion was asked whether he would
reach the major leagues if he returned to the Rangers. As the
family dog barked from the doorway, he did not hesitate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll make it,'' he said. ``It ain't that tough, really. You
just have to go out there and work hard. I ain't afraid of doing
that. Not really.'' &QL;

DOUGLAS BAZATA, FORMER OSS OFFICER, DIES AT 88 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., Md.)  (js) 
 By ERIC PACE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Douglas DeWitt Bazata, who served with the U.S. Office of
Strategic Services behind enemy lines in France in World War II and
later became an artist, died on July 14 in his home in Chevy Chase,
Md. He was 88.
</P>
<P>
   The death of Bazata was reported to The New York Times this
month.
</P>
<P>
   He was described as ``a red-haired soldier of fortune who called
all colonels `Sugar' '' in a 1978 book, ``Honorable Men,'' by
William E. Colby, a former director of central intelligence, and
Peter Forbath.
</P>
<P>
   Bazata, a Pennsylvanian, had already served in the Marines and
was a skilled boxer and marksman when he became an Army officer in
1942 and also joined the OSS, the forerunner of the Central
Intelligence Agency.
</P>
<P>
   He went on to be one of a daring group of about 50 U.S.
parachute officers who volunteered for what Colby described as ``a
highly hazardous mission'' in Nazi-occupied France, Belgium and the
Netherlands. Other members of the group included Stewart Alsop,
later a noted journalist, and Colby.
</P>
<P>
   In Britain, the U.S. group received training for operations as
commandos and behind-the-lines guerrillas in what was called the
OSS Operation Jedburgh. It is said to have received that name from
a place in Scotland where Jedburgh justice for sheep rustlers was
said to mean, ``Hang them first and question them afterward.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 250 U.S. and other Allied Jeds, as they became known,
were dropped by parachute in three-man international teams across
France, Belgium and the Netherlands to aid in leading the
resistance in those countries against the German occupiers.
</P>
<P>
   In 1944, Captain Bazata, as he then was, managed to parachute
into the Haute-Saone department in eastern France without being
captured by the Germans. He was the leader of a three-man Jedburgh
team, including a U.S. radioman and a French officer. Their team's
code name was Cedric.
</P>
<P>
   Once on the ground, Bazata got in touch with a British secret
agent whose code name was Emile. Emile had arrived in the
Haute-Saone earlier, also by parachute, with the mission of
assisting the area's Maquis, as the French anti-Nazi guerrillas
were known, in various ways, including providing liaison between
the Maquis and Allied elements in Britain. Bazata recalled, at a
Jed reunion in 1988 in Washington, that when he parachuted into
France, he brought along $300,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Maquis, along with Bazata and Emile, harried the German
troops and, it is said, drew attention away from a sector of
France's strategically important Mediterranean coast.
</P>
<P>
   Bazata, a major by the time he left the Army in 1947, was
recalled admiringly by Emile in a volume of memoirs, ``Maquis,''
which came out in 1947. Emile, whose real name was George Millar,
wrote that ``walking with the tempestuous Bazata toward the German
lines was like riding a horse with a mouth of iron.'' Once Emile
and Bazata escaped the attention of nearby Germans by pretending to
be innocent Frenchmen gathering mushrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Bernard Knox, an American Jed and also a noted classicist,
recalled on July 28, during Bazata's funeral in the chapel of
Arlington National Cemetery, that during the war, ``when it came to
close quarters, he was all steel.''
</P>
<P>
   His mettle was tested particularly during operations against the
Germans in August and September 1944, when he earned the Purple
Heart four times as well as the Distinguished Service Cross and
France's Croix de Guerre with two palms.
</P>
<P>
   Bazata's postwar life was mercifully peaceful, and diverse. He
studied wine making in Paris and worked in the wine industry in
Europe for some years. A decade after the war's end, he also
plunged into painting, in the abstract expressionist vein, and had
one-man shows in France, England and Germany as well as the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   His fellow painter Salvador Dali executed a canvas called
``Homage to Bazata'' in which Bazata was dressed as Don Quixote. An
admiring British art critic, Michael Webber, remarked in 1969, in
the British journal Arts Review, that by then Bazata had lived ``a
life eventful enough for a dozen novels.''
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1970s Bazata, having given up both the wine
industry and the painting world, began operating a pheasant
preserve and hunting club in Maryland. In later years he held a
post in the Veterans Administration and went on to serve in the
Reagan administration as special assistant to Secretary of the Navy
John F. Lehman Jr.
</P>
<P>
   Bazata was born in Wrightsville, Pa., the son of a Presbyterian
minister. He studied at Syracuse University and served in the
Marines from 1933 to 1937.
</P>
<P>
   His marriage in 1943 to Diana Chirieleison ended in divorce, as
did his marriage in 1948 to Penelope Grant.
</P>
<P>
   His wife of 29 years, Marie Pierre Bazata, survives him, as does
a son, Nicholas, of the county of Northumberland, England, and a
brother, Charles, of Wilmington, Del.

 &HT;    Second is a series on the early days of NASCAR
 &HT;    Jack Smith: Winner with every stock
 &HT;    By Al Levine
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPARTANBURG, S.C. _ The bays are full at Jack Smith's Automatic
Transmission Center on Main Street. Which leads one to conclude
that the roads around here are tough on gears or it's the only shop
in town.
</P>
<P>
   Or perhaps it's simply because the customers like to come to the
office to gape at the pictures, hammered into the walls, of Jack
Smith's racing career.
</P>
<P>
   Talking about the races with Smith, that's another thing. You've
got to contend with the whining of electric wrenches and the
hacking of Smith's persistent bronchial cough.
</P>
<P>
   On July 3, 1997, Smith had a heart attack. ``Had five-way bypass
surgery,'' he said. The congestive heart failure now turns a common
cold into a bronchial ordeal. ``It makes everything 10 times worse.
I'm OK, long as I don't talk.''
</P>
<P>
   The 75-year-old Smith still comes in the office nearly every
day, although his son, Lance, runs the shop. Business is good. ``I
thought when I made my first million I'd have it made,'' Smith
said. ``Then I found out how many people I owed.''
</P>
<P>
   Except for the occasional bronchial attack, life also is good.
There's just one thing that nags at Smith. ``I ought to be in that
Hall of Fame,'' he said. He's talking about the Georgia Sports Hall
of Fame, whose enshrinees include just two racers, Tim Flock and
Bill Elliott, despite the state's rich history in stock cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not the only one that's been overlooked,'' Smith said. But
he is the best spokesman for his candidacy, which any elector can
read about in one of the 11 career scrapbooks that Smith put
together for his children and grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Notes kept on every race
</P>
<P>
   From a race at Charlotte: ``I led 193 of the 400 laps and was
five laps ahead of the second-place car when disaster struck. A
large chunk of asphalt tore a hole in my fuel tank; gasoline came
pouring out. We tried stuffing rags into the hole and even tried
Camay soap. If we would have had a bar of Octagon soap, it would
have plugged the hole. I would have never believed that a bar of
soap could be worth over $25,000.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith was in 263 NASCAR races 1949-64, winning 21 times and
$139,470. He finished fourth in points once and fifth twice. He was
the Most Popular Driver in 1959.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could go run in Atlanta, a 25- or 30- or 50-lap race right
near home (Sandy Springs) and make $500,'' Smith said. ``Like Tim
(Flock) _ he'd get in his car or ride with somebody in a tow truck,
go all the way to Bangor, Maine, to run a race that paid $800. I'd
run the Peach Bowl in Atlanta, make $500 and it didn't cost me $3
for gas and oil to run and to get there and back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tim won the championship in 1952, and I won more races and
more money right in the Peach Bowl, way down there on Howell Mill
Road.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith ran in hundreds more races in the modifieds, which he
preferred, with great success. He won 31 races in a row in a 1953
Studebaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't run a whole lot of these Grand National Races until
1955,'' he said. ``I hated to get in the car. I wanted to get in
that old modified and spin them wheels and have them rooster tails
(spray of dirt) coming off the back.''
</P>
<P>
   He got interested in racing while growing up near Dawsonville
and Dahlonega.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's where all the whiskey was made at,'' Smith said.
``These two boys, Roy Hall and Lloyd Seay, would come down through
there, stop in Buckhead and tell the police, `We'll be back across
the Kellogg Creek bridge at 7:09.' They'd tell them when they would
come back with a load, just for the chase, just for the fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who went into racing from those parts was suspected of
hauling illegal liquor during Prohibition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody said if you're not a whiskey hauler, you can't drive
a race car,'' Smith said. ``People would tell me that, and it would
make me that much madder. So I built up a '34 Ford and went racing.
I didn't haul any whiskey. My boss man wouldn't let somebody do
that. His car ran at Lakewood Park in Atlanta. They had a city
ordinance that after you've been convicted you couldn't run
Lakewood. There were lots of them that couldn't run at Lakewood.''
</P>
<P>
   The scrapbook contains so many nuggets.
</P>
<P>
   Setting speed records
</P>
<P>
   He drove a solid red Chevrolet in 1959 that was called the Red
Fox. ``Buddy Davenport, who used to announce all the races, would
say, `Now, when that Red Fox gets out in front, them hound dogs are
gonna have a hard time catchin' it,''' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, headlines called Smith the ``World's Fastest Stock
Car Driver,'' because he set speed records in a Pontiac at Daytona
in a five-mile qualifying run, 25-mile race, 100-mile race and a
250-mile race, averaging 146 mph. ``Ain't nobody ever heard of
anything like that,'' he said. ``I just went flat out.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith was the first driver with radio controls in his car,
although it initially had one major glitch: Besides his crew chief,
Smith would constantly get directions from the dispatcher at a
Coca-Cola plant near the Charlotte Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a 12-lap lead at Charlotte on account of that radio,''
Smith said. ``I was coming by the start/finish line, and they said
`Wreck in (turn) number four, wreck in number four,' and, `Wreck
comin' off two, wreck comin' off two.' I knew right where it was
at; I could run up there and brake and drive down through there
where everybody else didn't know where the wreck was. It was a
crude setup. If you wanted to talk to somebody, you mashed your
dimmer switch and talked into the radio speaker. Everybody had them
within three weeks time.''
</P>
<P>
   Newspaper stories also called him ``The Original Hard Luck
Guy,'' for destroying three race cars in less than three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1958 Southern 500 at Darlington, he got into some oil
after Jim Reed blew an engine, smashed into the scaffolding
surrounding the track, went up and over the railing and landed
car-nose-down in sand.
</P>
<P>
   ``This happened on a Monday,'' Smith said. ``Sunday, I'm leading
the race and gone. They motioned for me to come in, and I backed
off of it and started coming into the pits. When I did I blowed the
right front tire, went through the fence. Back then they had them
old 2-x-10 oak fences. One of the boards had my head pushed up
against the roll bar. Well, we come back and got another car. This
is a second brand-new automobile. The next Sunday we were running
in Nashville. Rex White was leading; I was running second; he blows
a right front tire and tore up the prettiest little ol' car you
ever seen. I was sitting there riding around while they got it
cleaned up, thinking how pitiful that was. Well, eight laps later,
I put mine through the wall. I demolished three cars in 11 or 12
days.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith's worst racing injury was a cut nose.
</P>
<P>
   He owned his own car, worked for factory teams and was one of
the drivers that Carl Kiekhaefer hired as the sport's first
multi-car owner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a transmission shop (in Atlanta) before I went to work
for Kiekhaefer,'' Smith said. ``There was no amount of money I
could make in a garage that I was making with Kiekhafer. He paid us
$1,100 a month salary in 1957. You think that wasn't some money?
And he paid you so much a meal from the time you left home till you
got back. If you left home on Friday at 12 o'clock, every four
hours he paid you. It wasn't but a dollar and half for a meal. That
added up, back then, seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Old race fans come in the shop now _ it was his race shop during
his career _ to talk about the good old days. Smith is happy to
oblige.
</P>
<P>
   ``A man come in the shop, and he said if he had been in the
grandstand that day in Charlotte (when a chunk of asphalt caused a
gas leak), he would've fixed us up, and we would have won the race.
He went to his car and got out a gallon of gas, reached into his
pocket for a little thing, rolled it out just a little bit, put gas
halfway in there, tied a knot in it, and for 40 minutes it didn't
drop a drop.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a condom. I never dreamed _ gas don't bother a
condom.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   TOMS RIVER, N.J. _ The day after the hometown Boys of Summer
landed once again in the Little League World Series, a handful of
fathers, members of the Toms River East Little League board,
huddled over a long table at the league's headquarters and planned
another parade down Main Street.
</P>
<P>
   If the team of mostly 12-year-olds returns victorious from
Williamsport, Pa., where the series begins on Sunday, the world
title will be its second in a row, but it will be no less exciting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was telling someone yesterday that winning the series last
year was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,'' said Kevin Fox, a vice
president of the board who is trying to raise $70,000 for a bronze
sculpture of a ballplayer with his coach to commemorate last year's
victory. ``But I guess we're going to break that old saying.''
</P>
<P>
   As he spoke, Fox stood inside the league's new $150,000 indoor
practice center with batting cages, pitching areas and televisions
to show videos during clinics. It was built with donations to allow
for training in the winter.
</P>
<P>
   With its 3-0 victory over Middleboro, Mass., on Thursday, Toms
River became just the third team in the United States to return to
the Little League World Series the year after winning the title.
Lock Haven, Pa., did so in 1948-49, and Long Beach, Calif., did in
1992-93.
</P>
<P>
   To say that people in this Ocean County community were jubilant
would be an understatement. On Thursday night, hundreds of people
crowded into Mugsy's, a sports bar on Hooper Avenue, to watch the
game on ESPN. Those who did not find room here watched it at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just incredible,'' said Anthony Baiamonte, owner of
Mugsy's, which calls itself the unofficial headquarters of the
team. ``We need some new adjectives _ that's how good these kids
are.''
</P>
<P>
   No one could explain what it is about Toms River, a suburb that
is part of Dover Township, a community of 90,000, that produced
winners two years in a row.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it's the water,'' Chuck Friesema, an electrician who was
having a drink at Mugsy's, said about Toms River, which until last
year was best known as the possible site of a cancer cluster. ``I
don't know if it's the kids who take it more seriously here, or if
it's the coaching, and the parents just enjoy doing it and living
vicariously through the kids,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor of Dover Township, Raymond P. Fox (no relation to
Kevin, the board vice president), had another explanation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just great people, and a great town,'' he said at his
office in the township hall, where pictures of last year's victory
are plastered along the hallways. ``Certainly our Little League
organizations are the best around. And our schools, too. The Toms
River regional school system is one of the best in the state.''
</P>
<P>
   Baseball is definitely a big deal here, but so are other sports,
the mayor pointed out. There are two leagues here, Toms River with
600 players, and Toms River East, with 1,200, which is sending a
team of its all-stars to the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   The town's soccer leagues actually have more players, and there
is also a girls' softball league, a Pop Warner football league and
Biddy Basketball.
</P>
<P>
   But obviously, Little League is king right now. The Toms River
East Little League, with headquarters on Windsor Avenue, has an
annual budget of $200,000.
</P>
<P>
   The fields here look like those tucked into a thousand other
suburban communities, but the grass seems lusher and some of the
fields are lighted for nighttime play. The indoor center opened in
February.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to have this if we're going to compete against teams
from California and Puerto Rico who can play all year long,'' said
Fox, the Little League board member, who is also a United Airlines
pilot. ``The season here only runs from June, when practice begins,
to late August, if the teams make the finals.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, the Town Council donated a four-acre parcel to the
league to expand its playing area.
</P>
<P>
   Fox and Stan Benisz, another board member, conceded that some of
the parents might be living vicariously through their sons and
daughters. But the team could not succeed without the parents, who
volunteer to fill every job from coaching to managing the
concession stands.
</P>
<P>
   Some parents take leaves of absence from their jobs to follow
the children around, said Benisz, who said it is not uncommon for
some parents on the board to put in 500 or 600 hours a year on team
business.
</P>
<P>
   It is all worth it, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of last year we kept saying to ourselves: `How are you
going to top this? How are we going to top this?''' said Gary
Goldsack, president of the league board. ``Well, we just found out
how.''

<P>
   In Williamsport, where the team will play Phenix City, Ala., on
Sunday at 6 p.m., Mike Gaynor, manager of the Toms River East
Americans Little League team, was reflecting on what made his team
a winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got good players,'' he said. ``They've done a nice job. When
we needed to win, we found a way to win. I guess I'm doing
something right.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think any time you have a Little League team with
12-year-olds, as much talent as you have, you never know how the
kids are going to handle the pressure. You really don't learn the
chemistry until you start playing. And hopefully, you're not losing
games in the meantime before you find out what you need.''
</P>
<P>
   What captures the imagination of the townspeople is that the
boys are so young, and they play with such fervor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids are psyched,'' said Darren Lardieri, who has a
woodworking business here and has been following the team, even
though he has no children on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not thinking about whether they get hurt or their
contracts, like the professional athletes are. These kids, they'll
take the chance. They'll do what it takes to win. It makes the
whole game nicer.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, when the Little Leaguers won the World Series,
townspeople by the thousands lined up along Route 37, one of the
community's main thoroughfares, from the Garden State Parkway to
downtown. Route 37 had to be closed for a few hours. A few days
later, the town held an official parade for them.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the team and the township leaders are planning only
one parade, on the day the players return from the finals in
Williamsport, whether they win or not.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt about it,'' the Mayor said. ``Win, lose or
draw, they're champions anyway, as far as we're concerned.''

KERKORIAN EXPLORES MAKING BID FOR THE JETS  
 THROWING IT ALL AWAY  
 PATRIOTS HIRE FORMER AGENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Financier Kirk Kerkorian, who is best known for his ownership of
the MGM Grand Hotel and his mid-1990s battle to take over Chrysler,
has expressed a desire to purchase the New York Jets, according to
two National Football League owners.
</P>
<P>
   One of the owners called the 82-year-old Kerkorian's chance of
getting the Jets ``good if he really wants them.'' Kerkorian was
the 75th-richest man in the world in 1998, according to Forbes
magazine's annual ranking, with an estimated net worth of $3.8
billion.
</P>
<P>
   In May, soon after the death of the Jets' owner, Leon Hess,
Hess' estate announced the hiring of the investment firm Goldman,
Sachs &AMP; Co. to handle the sale process.
</P>
<P>
   According to financial experts, the Jets could go for $500
million. Goldman, Sachs is prepared to send out prospectuses to
potential bidders as early as this week.
</P>
<P>
   Potential buyers can then make a bid, according to owners, and
those bids will be presented to the Hess estate, which will accept
the highest or most agreeable offer.
</P>
<P>
   One of the Goldman, Sachs prospectus books is expected to go to
Kerkorian, who has contacted the firm, according to the two owners.
Other potential bidders include New York real estate developer
Samuel J. LeFrak, Mets co-owner Nelson Doubleday, Devils owner John
McMullen and Charles Dolan, Cablevision's chairman.
</P>
<P>
   A majority of the NFL's owners would have to approve the team's
new ownership.
</P>
<P>
   When asked what qualities he would like in the new Jets owner,
Commissioner Paul Tagliabue said: ``The NFL in New York has had
mighty few owners in 80 years of NFL football. But they have all
been strong league people and have known the importance of doing
well in every city, doing well in Buffalo, Green Bay and Kansas
City, as well as in New York, Chicago and some of the big markets.
So, someone that has the same values and long-term vision is what
you'd like to see.''
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue added that the league is working closely with Hess'
son, John, who is representing the family, and the Jets team
president Steve Gutman, who is representing the team.
</P>
<P>
   The sale of the Jets could go quickly, since the Hess estate
will most likely not bid for the team. The only thing that could
slow the process, owners maintain, is the desire of coach Bill
Parcells to hold off the sale because of the potential distraction
it could provide for the team. The Jets lost in the AFC
championship game last season.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Parcells may not have a choice because if a blockbuster bid
is made soon, the estate would be foolish to ask the potential
buyer to wait.
</P>
<P>
   If Kerkorian does enter the bidding process, he will be a
formidable candidate. He would be one of the league's wealthiest
owners, and would probably have little trouble financing the
purchase of the team.
</P>
<P>
   Kerkorian also donates significant amounts of time and money to
charitable causes. In January, Kerkorian gave $15 million to the
American Red Cross for earthquake reconstruction and relief efforts
in Armenia, which was devastated by a 1988 earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   Kerkorian, who shuns publicity, was born the son of an Armenian
immigrant fruit farmer. He earned a reputation for scrappiness
early in life _ even being sent to reform school as a teen-ager _
and earned the nickname Rifle Right Kerkorian as a lightweight
amateur boxer.
</P>
<P>
   He never got a high school diploma, but after being introduced
to flying by a friend, became so skilled at it that he was hired to
train pilots during World War II. Following the war he built the
Trans International Airline charter service and sold it in 1968 for
$104 million. He then purchased a 40 percent stake in MGM movie
studios and has since been a major stockholder in the studio as
well as in Chrysler, which he tried to purchase a controlling
interest in in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Since Kerkorian spends most of his time in the West, mainly in
Las Vegas, his potential entry into the Jets' bidding process is
the first signal that the team's suitors will not be limited to the
New York area.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets are the third NFL franchise in the last several years
to be put up for sale, joining the Washington Redskins and the
Cleveland Browns.
</P>
<P>
   Throwing It All Away
</P>
<P>
   If the group of rookie quarterbacks struggling through hours in
the classroom and taking a beating on the field can learn from
anything, it is from the experiences of Ryan Leaf, the second
player chosen in last year's draft.
</P>
<P>
   It was impossible for the San Diego Chargers to know that Leaf
would turn out to be so immature.
</P>
<P>
   As a rookie last season, he finished with one of the worst
quarterback ratings in the league, he was caught on videotape
cursing at a reporter and he alienated most of his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Leaf told USA Today he would likely not be back once
his contract reaches the voidable portions after the 2000 season.
Then, just a day later, he got into a confrontation with a heckling
fan, again caught on video, leading to teammates again blasting him
for his immaturity.
</P>
<P>
   So far none of the five quarterbacks taken in the first round of
this year's draft have imploded. Tim Couch is doing well in
Cleveland and might start. Daunte Culpepper is adjusting to being a
backup in Minnesota but has displayed a powerful arm. Donovan
McNabb is beginning to win over tough Philadelphia fans who wanted
the Eagles to draft running back Ricky Williams. Cade McNown is a
quick study in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   The quarterback most likely to experience problems this season
is Cincinnati's Akili Smith, the third pick overall. Smith is still
not in training camp because of a salary dispute, and at this point
there is little chance he can catch up with his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   Patriots Hire Former Agent
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots remain busy trying patch all of their injured
players, but the team is also engrossed in completing plans for its
new stadium. Because Andy Wasynczuk, the vice president for
business operations, has been so involved in stadium issues,
several weeks ago the Patriots started looking for someone to help
him deal with the job he usually does, which is signing players.
They hired former player agent Jack Mula.
</P>
<P>
   The move continues a trend by teams that are now hiring the
enemy. Agents and teams are usually at opposite ends of the
spectrum since the agent wants as much money as possible for the
player and the team wants to keep salaries as low as possible.
</P>
<P>
   But teams, recognizing the value that agents can play if they
cross the line, are hiring them to help with negotiations. Agents
can tell teams the tricks they use in negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Green Bay hired former agent Andrew Brandt as director of player
finance and the Oakland Raiders brought in former agent Bruce Allen
to negotiate contracts.

 &HT;    Jarrett eager for Pepsi 400 victory
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Brooklyn, Mich. _ Dale Jarrett returns today to Michigan
Speedway, the very same track he threatened to reach Winston Cup's
ultimate single-event achievement two months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett, the points leader who will start third in today's Pepsi
400, had the season's most dominant performance by a driver during
the circuit's last stop at the two-mile oval. During the ride to
victory lane at June's Kmart 400, Jarrett briefly threatened to lap
the field, which has not been accomplished on track longer than a
mile in more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   The Ford No. 88 driver led by as many as nine seconds during the
race. Only four other drivers were on the lead lap when Jarrett
crossed the finish line. Jarrett is back in same Ford Taurus for
today's race, but does not necessarily expect the same outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing about this racin' is that even though you may have a
great car at a track one time, you go back the next time and you
might take everything the same,'' Jarrett said, ``and it doesn't
work the same.''
</P>
<P>
   The last driver to lap the field on a superspeedway was Kyle
Petty at the then-Charlotte Motor Speedway in 1987. The last to do
it on a short track was Geoffrey Bodine at North Wilkesboro, N.C.,
(0.625 mile) in '94.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a once in a lifetime thing for most people,'' recalled
Petty. ``Even when you look at the season (Bill) Elliott had in
'85, and how much stronger he was than everybody else and how great
they ran week after week, he did it just (once on a short track).
Mere mortals have a shot at it once in a lifetime.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett's final margin of victory in the June race was .505
seconds, but runner-up Jeff Gordon said that was only because
Jarrett choose to not make it larger.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just rode around out there most of the day,'' Gordon said.
``We were so strung out that I couldn't see the leader and third
place (Jeff Burton) couldn't see me. The only time that's any fun
is when you're leading.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett, in his usual humble mood on Saturday, downplayed his
chances of lapping the field at the last Michigan race or any
future race.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way that is going to happen is basically if you catch
somebody in the pits and a caution flag comes out,'' Jarrett said.
``That's the only way to get everybody a lap down. ``Just doing it
on the race track, that was the best car I've ever had (at the
Kmart 400), and there were still four guys on the lead lap with us.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Jarrett's father Ned is well-remembered for lapping
the field. The former Winston Cup great won the '65 Darlington race
by a shocking 14 laps over the runner-up. Those days are long gone
and so are the chances of winning by a single lap, many drivers
say.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is close to impossible,'' Dale Jarrett said.
``There are just so many good cars out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Pepsi 400 pole sitter Ward Burton, ``They'd have to have a
perfect car, perfect pit stops, just a totally perfect day. The
thing is nowadays you'd have to do all of that just to have a
chance at winning the race at all, (much less) lapping the field.''

 &HT;    Burton sets record, takes Pepsi 400 pole
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLYN, Mich. _ Ward Burton is enjoying a career year in
Winston Cup. Burton, who is No. 11 in the points standings, has
accomplished a lot already this season without winning a pole or a
race.
</P>
<P>
   After Friday's qualifying at Michigan Speedway, the Pontiac No.
22 no longer lacks a pole. Burton set a track-qualifying record of
188.843 mph to capture the top spot for the Pepsi 400 on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The team did it all,'' Burton said. ``(The car) was great from
the minute I got into it. All we did was a little fine tuning.''
</P>
<P>
   Burton, whose only career victory was at Rockingham in 1995,
will share the front row with Mike Skinner, who was clocked at
187.999 mph. Points leader Dale Jarrett, Geoffrey Bodine, and
Jeremy Mayfield round out the top five.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ward was stronger than we were,'' Skinner said. ``We won
practice (against him), but he won qualifying. He had a perfect
lap.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Gordon, who will start ninth Sunday, had set the previous
record of 186.945 mph during the June race at Michigan Speedway. It
was Burton's first pole in 37 races since Pocono during the '98
season, which was Burton's best in six years with a 16th-place
finish in the final standings.
</P>
<P>
   Son ahead of father
</P>
<P>
   In his third Winston Cup race of the season, Dale Earnhardt Jr.
captured the No. 17 position for Sunday's race. His famous father,
however, ended up in the 35th position and will likely take a
provisional today to make the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just never got the car handling today,'' Dale Earnhardt Sr.
said sternly.
</P>
<P>
   Said the son, ``We made the first round, and I was worried at
the start of the year about just making the races.''
</P>
<P>
   Dale Jr. is scheduled to run in five Cup races this year, with
the final two being at Richmond and Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Wrecking crew
</P>
<P>
   Ernie Irvan was not the only driver to make contact with the
wall during Busch practice on Friday. Gus Wasson was unhurt after
banging up the No. 96 Chevy.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Christopher, who suffered a bruised right knee during a
separate wreck, might consider changing the number on his No. 13
Chevy after this week's turn of events. He originally earned the
fourth position for today's NAPA 200, but it was disallowed due to
an unproven shock part. When he wrecked Friday morning, he was left
without a car to attempt second-round qualifying.
</P>
<P>
   Extra laps
</P>
<P>
   Busch driver Mike McLaughlin, who is eighth in the Busch points
standings, has been picked up by Innovative Motorsports, Inc., for
the 2000 season. It's an expansion move for IMI, which already
fields a team for Andy Santerre. McLaughlin will finish out this
year with Cicci-Welliver Racing. ... Joe Nemechek, Cup driver of
the No. 42 Chevy, and Team SABCO are parting at the end of the
season under mutual agreement. ``This was an extremely difficult
decision for the both of us, but one we had been discussing for a
while,'' said Felix Sabates, owner of Team SABCO ... Sterling
Marlin was fined $5,000 for bumping Chad Little in the pit area
after last Sunday's Frontier at The Glen. Marlin had no complaints
with the fine. ``I did what I needed to do,'' Marlin said. ``If a
guy runs over me again, I'll do it again. I'm tired of getting run
over.''

 &HT;    Second is a series on the early days of NASCAR
 &HT;    Jack Smith: Winner with every stock
 &HT;    By Al Levine
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SPARTANBURG, S.C. _ The bays are full at Jack Smith's Automatic
Transmission Center on Main Street. Which leads one to conclude
that the roads around here are tough on gears or it's the only shop
in town.
</P>
<P>
   Or perhaps it's simply because the customers like to come to the
office to gape at the pictures, hammered into the walls, of Jack
Smith's racing career.
</P>
<P>
   Talking about the races with Smith, that's another thing. You've
got to contend with the whining of electric wrenches and the
hacking of Smith's persistent bronchial cough.
</P>
<P>
   On July 3, 1997, Smith had a heart attack. ``Had five-way bypass
surgery,'' he said. The congestive heart failure now turns a common
cold into a bronchial ordeal. ``It makes everything 10 times worse.
I'm OK, long as I don't talk.''
</P>
<P>
   The 75-year-old Smith still comes in the office nearly every
day, although his son, Lance, runs the shop. Business is good. ``I
thought when I made my first million I'd have it made,'' Smith
said. ``Then I found out how many people I owed.''
</P>
<P>
   Except for the occasional bronchial attack, life also is good.
There's just one thing that nags at Smith. ``I ought to be in that
Hall of Fame,'' he said. He's talking about the Georgia Sports Hall
of Fame, whose enshrinees include just two racers, Tim Flock and
Bill Elliott, despite the state's rich history in stock cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not the only one that's been overlooked,'' Smith said. But
he is the best spokesman for his candidacy, which any elector can
read about in one of the 11 career scrapbooks that Smith put
together for his children and grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Notes kept on every race
</P>
<P>
   From a race at Charlotte: ``I led 193 of the 400 laps and was
five laps ahead of the second-place car when disaster struck. A
large chunk of asphalt tore a hole in my fuel tank; gasoline came
pouring out. We tried stuffing rags into the hole and even tried
Camay soap. If we would have had a bar of Octagon soap, it would
have plugged the hole. I would have never believed that a bar of
soap could be worth over $25,000.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith was in 263 NASCAR races 1949-64, winning 21 times and
$139,470. He finished fourth in points once and fifth twice. He was
the Most Popular Driver in 1959.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could go run in Atlanta, a 25- or 30- or 50-lap race right
near home (Sandy Springs) and make $500,'' Smith said. ``Like Tim
(Flock) _ he'd get in his car or ride with somebody in a tow truck,
go all the way to Bangor, Maine, to run a race that paid $800. I'd
run the Peach Bowl in Atlanta, make $500 and it didn't cost me $3
for gas and oil to run and to get there and back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tim won the championship in 1952, and I won more races and
more money right in the Peach Bowl, way down there on Howell Mill
Road.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith ran in hundreds more races in the modifieds, which he
preferred, with great success. He won 31 races in a row in a 1953
Studebaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't run a whole lot of these Grand National Races until
1955,'' he said. ``I hated to get in the car. I wanted to get in
that old modified and spin them wheels and have them rooster tails
(spray of dirt) coming off the back.''
</P>
<P>
   He got interested in racing while growing up near Dawsonville
and Dahlonega.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's where all the whiskey was made at,'' Smith said.
``These two boys, Roy Hall and Lloyd Seay, would come down through
there, stop in Buckhead and tell the police, `We'll be back across
the Kellogg Creek bridge at 7:09.' They'd tell them when they would
come back with a load, just for the chase, just for the fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who went into racing from those parts was suspected of
hauling illegal liquor during Prohibition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody said if you're not a whiskey hauler, you can't drive
a race car,'' Smith said. ``People would tell me that, and it would
make me that much madder. So I built up a '34 Ford and went racing.
I didn't haul any whiskey. My boss man wouldn't let somebody do
that. His car ran at Lakewood Park in Atlanta. They had a city
ordinance that after you've been convicted you couldn't run
Lakewood. There were lots of them that couldn't run at Lakewood.''
</P>
<P>
   The scrapbook contains so many nuggets.
</P>
<P>
   Setting speed records
</P>
<P>
   He drove a solid red Chevrolet in 1959 that was called the Red
Fox. ``Buddy Davenport, who used to announce all the races, would
say, `Now, when that Red Fox gets out in front, them hound dogs are
gonna have a hard time catchin' it,''' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, headlines called Smith the ``World's Fastest Stock
Car Driver,'' because he set speed records in a Pontiac at Daytona
in a five-mile qualifying run, 25-mile race, 100-mile race and a
250-mile race, averaging 146 mph. ``Ain't nobody ever heard of
anything like that,'' he said. ``I just went flat out.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith was the first driver with radio controls in his car,
although it initially had one major glitch: Besides his crew chief,
Smith would constantly get directions from the dispatcher at a
Coca-Cola plant near the Charlotte Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a 12-lap lead at Charlotte on account of that radio,''
Smith said. ``I was coming by the start/finish line, and they said
`Wreck in (turn) number four, wreck in number four,' and, `Wreck
comin' off two, wreck comin' off two.' I knew right where it was
at; I could run up there and brake and drive down through there
where everybody else didn't know where the wreck was. It was a
crude setup. If you wanted to talk to somebody, you mashed your
dimmer switch and talked into the radio speaker. Everybody had them
within three weeks time.''
</P>
<P>
   Newspaper stories also called him ``The Original Hard Luck
Guy,'' for destroying three race cars in less than three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1958 Southern 500 at Darlington, he got into some oil
after Jim Reed blew an engine, smashed into the scaffolding
surrounding the track, went up and over the railing and landed
car-nose-down in sand.
</P>
<P>
   ``This happened on a Monday,'' Smith said. ``Sunday, I'm leading
the race and gone. They motioned for me to come in, and I backed
off of it and started coming into the pits. When I did I blowed the
right front tire, went through the fence. Back then they had them
old 2-x-10 oak fences. One of the boards had my head pushed up
against the roll bar. Well, we come back and got another car. This
is a second brand-new automobile. The next Sunday we were running
in Nashville. Rex White was leading; I was running second; he blows
a right front tire and tore up the prettiest little ol' car you
ever seen. I was sitting there riding around while they got it
cleaned up, thinking how pitiful that was. Well, eight laps later,
I put mine through the wall. I demolished three cars in 11 or 12
days.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith's worst racing injury was a cut nose.
</P>
<P>
   He owned his own car, worked for factory teams and was one of
the drivers that Carl Kiekhaefer hired as the sport's first
multi-car owner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a transmission shop (in Atlanta) before I went to work
for Kiekhaefer,'' Smith said. ``There was no amount of money I

$1,100 a month salary in 1957. You think that wasn't some money?
And he paid you so much a meal from the time you left home till you
got back. If you left home on Friday at 12 o'clock, every four
hours he paid you. It wasn't but a dollar and half for a meal. That
added up, back then, seriously.''

 &HT;    Middle Ga. stage for overlooked
 &HT;    By Guy Curtright
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COCHRAN, Ga. _ The football budget is so small at Middle Georgia
College that it would barely cover training-room expenses at some
big-time schools.
</P>
<P>
   Despite limited funds and no full athletic scholarships,
however, Middle Georgia has gone to three junior- college bowl
games since resuming football in 1994 and has sent more than 90
players on to four-year colleges.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-three players from last year's team signed scholarships
with four-year schools, including 18 of 20 who played at Middle
Georgia for two seasons. Leading the way was linebacker Kendrell
Bell, a Georgia signee.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're here to give players a chance who didn't have the grades
or were overlooked for some other reason,'' said coach Randy
Pippin, who won a 1994 junior-college title at Trinity Valley in
Texas. ``If things had gone right for these kids, they won't be
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Middle Georgia was ranked as high as No. 2 in the nation last
year, but then had to forfeit two games because of an ineligible
player and were upset by rival Georgia Military College 13-6 in the
regular-season finale. The Warriors bounced back to rout Northwest
Mississippi 41-3 in the Mineral Water Bowl, finishing 9-3 and
ranked No. 11.
</P>
<P>
   Middle Georgia's success has come despite a buget that has
usually been below $100,000 and a taxing road schedule that eats up
a good part of the funds. With only one other junior-college
program in the state, the Warriors will make two trips by bus to
Texas this season and one each to New York, Maryland and North
Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Pippin is the only member of the 10-man staff paid for coaching,
and he also is the athletics director. Several assistants are dorm
directors. Other are volunteers, including former Kansas City
Chiefs defensive back Jim Marsalis, who drives from his home in
Warner Robins each day.
</P>
<P>
   More than 150 players _ including four from Class AAAA state
champ Valdosta _ turned out for practice this season, making
equipment scarce. Middle Georgia receives hand-me-downs from
several colleges, and the Atlanta Falcons have donated game pants
and jersies; the Warriors' colors are red and black, too.
</P>
<P>
   At least Middle Georgia now has its own place to play. A
3,000-seat stadium just off campus opened last year, thanks in part
to a $100,000 donation by alumnus Doyle NeSmith Sr. Lights will be
in place before Middle Georgia's home-opener Sept. 11 against
Navarro of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Walker, who had signed with Auburn, naturally was
disappointed when he didn't qualify academically. But the freshman
from Hardaway High School in Columbus is trying to make the best of
the situation. ``There is a lot of talent here,'' Walker said. ``We
just want a chance to show what we can do.''

 &HT;    Middle Georgia gets a kick from Butler
 &HT;    By Guy Curtright
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COCHRAN, Ga. _ Even on a team that started practice with 152
football hopefuls of all sizes and shapes, one player stands out at
Middle Georgia College.
</P>
<P>
   The new placekicker is the one with the ponytail, a leggy photo
in Atlanta magazine and, temporarily, a whole dorm to herself.
</P>
<P>
   At Middle Georgia, the football team is co-ed, but student
housing isn't. That's why freshman Tonya Butler has spent most of
the last two weeks sleeping alone in a girl's dorm that at times
has seemed as eerie as a haunted house.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kinda creepy in there all by myself,'' Butler said after
a recent practice. ``I'll be glad when the other students get here.
I guess it might get a little noisy then, but right now it's too
quiet.''
</P>
<P>
   All of that will change soon.
</P>
<P>
   Classes begin Monday at Middle Georgia, a junior college of
2,000 students about 40 miles southeast of Macon.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Butler will make her junior college football debut,
handling the extra point and field goal attempts when the Warriors
open the season at Kilgore, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope they don't look at the roster and notice my name,''
said Butler, who got so much coverage in high school that teammates
called her ``Miss Hollywood'' for a while. ``It sure would be nice
if they wouldn't make a big deal about me being a girl, because
I'll be nervous enough as it is. But by now, I guess I should be
used to all the attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Middle Georgia has won 40 games, been ranked as high as No. 2
nationally and gone to three bowl games since resuming football in
1994 after a 35-year absence. But all that winning didn't create
the attention that signing a female kicker did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had people calling from everywhere after we signed Tonya,''
said coach Randy Pippin, in his second season. ``For us, it's a
win-win situation. The publicity is nice, but that's not why she's
here. She's here to help us win games, and she will.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone here hopes to earn a scholarship to an NCAA school,
and I think Tonya will. She's that good of a kicker.''
</P>
<P>
   In three seasons at Riverdale High School in Clayton County,
Butler made 112 of 119 extra points and 17 of 30 field-goal
attempts while receiving all-state mention and earning a spot in
the Georgia Athletic Coaches Association North-South All-Star Game.
</P>
<P>
   But no female ever has received a football scholarship to a
four-year school, so Butler had to go off to junior college to
prove herself again. ``I knew I was good enough to keep kicking,''
said Butler, whose brother, Tony, is a senior linebacker at Georgia
Southern.
</P>
<P>
   The only female to kick for a four-year college in a
regular-season game was Liz Heaston of Willamette University, an
NAIA school in Oregon. She was 2 of 4 on extra points in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Heather Sue Mercer tried out at Duke and kicked a field goal in
the Blue Devils' 1995 spring game. But she didn't make the team and
filed a sex-discrimination suit that is still pending.
</P>
<P>
   When Middle Georgia players first heard that the school was
recruiting Butler, they feared the worst. ``Everyone wanted to know
what the heck was going on,'' sophomore wide receiver Daniel
O'Brien said. ``Our goal here is to win a national title. No one
was interested in striking a blow for women's lib or something.''
</P>
<P>
   But once Butler arrived on campus and her new teammates got a
chance to see her kick, the Middle Georgia players were won over
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Damn, she can kick,'' O'Brien said after several practices,
still marveling at Butler's accuracy. ``Last season, we missed a
lot of extra points. If she can help us win games, what difference
does it make if she's a girl? To us, she's just a kicker.''
</P>
<P>
   Casey Sirmons kicked for Middle Georgia last season, but he
broke his foot helping to lay carpet for his father just before the
start of practice. The sophomore from West Laurens High School is
expected to miss the first half of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tonya is coming along real good,'' said volunteer kicking
coach Mickey McPhaul, who played at Middle Georgia in the
mid-1950s. ``I never thought I'd be working with a girl, but then
when I played we didn't even lift weights. Times change.''
</P>
<P>
   Butler, who worked on her kicking all summer, said she has
adjusted to kicking without the tee allowed in high school. But she
said it has cut her top range from up to 50 yards to about 40.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need to build my range back up,'' said Butler, who is 5 feet
6 and 130 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   But she said that most of her adjusting has had to come away
from the field. Cochran, with a population of 4,390, is not like
being in metro Atlanta, and she has college classes to get used to
and new friends to make.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've already made the rule that I won't date teammates,'' said
Butler, who has her college costs covered by a Hope Scholarship and
other grants.
</P>
<P>
   Butler, a member of the homecoming court in high school, had
hoped that the August issue of Atlanta magazine with her posing in
a miniskirt for an article titled ``Nothing Beats a Great Pair of
Legs'' wouldn't make it to Cochran.
</P>
<P>
   She was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got here, one of the coaches already had a copy,''
Butler said. ``I don't know if any of the players have seen it yet,
but at least no one has given me a hard time yet. Really, the skirt
wasn't as short as it looked. I promise.''

 &HT;    Tarheels have plenty of young talent
 &HT;    By Norman Arey
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHAPEL HILL, N.C. _ Ronald Curry was a huge disappointment last
year during his freshman season at North Carolina. The shooting
guard averaged only 2.8 points per game, managed just 1.7 assists
and grabbed 1.5 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Oh yeah, that was basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Curry was a huge success last year during his freshman
season on the football field. The 18-year-old quarterback from
Hampton, Va., perhaps the highest profile athlete ever coming out
of high school, threw for 975 yards and six touchdowns and rushed
419 yards and two other scores in leading the Tar Heels to a 7-5
season. Curry was voted the MPV in Carolina's 20-13 win over San
Diego State in the Las Vegas Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The two-sport athlete was as big a success in football as he was
a flop in basketball. The fact that he was forced into football
action when Oscar Davenport was injured in the season opener and
wasn't counted on to contribute much in basketball may have had a
lot to do with his first year in Chapel Hill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I surprised a lot of people last year,'' Curry said. ``I think
the coaches were just planning on using me as a punt returner.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ronald's not just an athlete, he's a great quarterback,'' said
Carolina offensive coordinator Steve Marshall. ``I't s a
semi-insult, to my way of thinking, to call him an athlete.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ronald's much, much improved,'' said coach Carl Torbush.
``He's in complete command of our offense now. Over the past 10
practices, he's throwing the ball as well as anybody I've seen here
in 12 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Torbush admits that having Curry does have its drawbacks. ``We
tried to sign quarterbacks last year and nobody wanted to come,''
he said. ``We've absolutely got to sign one for next season. You
can't operate a program with just two quarterbacks.''
</P>
<P>
   Curry is backed up by redshirt freshman Luke Huard. Behind Huard
is no one.
</P>
<P>
   Carolina opens its season against arch-rival Virginia in a
strange scheduling year in the ACC. But the Tar Heels, who
struggled offensively last year, may be a completely different team
in '99. ``Last year, of the eleven starters on offense coming into
the first game, only three were left standing at the end of the
year,'' Torbush said. ``But with the experience Ronald had last
year, we're going to be better. We have five tailbacks who I feel
can contribute. Last year, we had to move two fullbacks to the
tailback spot.''
</P>
<P>
   Torbush compares Curry to Charlie Ward, who won the Heisman
while directing Florida State's attack. ``Ward was a special player
and if we can put more good players around Ronald, he has the
opportunity to be that good. He's at the point that he can make a
good team great.''
</P>
<P>
   Curry says the hoopla and gaggle of writers and radio/TV folks
that constantly seek him out doesn't bother him. ``In my first game
in high school, we went into overtime and I scored the winning
touchdown and I've had a lot of press ever since,'' he said. ``I'm
just going to be the same old Ronald. I'm never going to change
personally.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've changed as a football player, I'm much better,'' he said.
``When I make mistakes now, I know the mistake I made. Being a
quarterback takes a lot. I know everything about it now.''
</P>
<P>
   As to which sport he'll eventually pursue full time, Curry
shakes his head. ``The decision is mine to make and I'm not even
close to making it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Over the summer, Curry shed the No. 13 jersey he wore last
season and donned No. 1 _ as if he needed any more attention than
he gets on the field anyway.

 &HT;    New defense aides have effect at Tech
 &HT;    By J.C. Clemons
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Although the whirlwind of defensive coaches exiting
the Georgia Tech program after last season was not forced, it left
a perception that working for Yellow Jackets head coach George
O'Leary _ a defensive maestro _ may be hazardous to one's coaching
health.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing could be further from the truth, insists the three new
defensive assistants. That nearly a hundred coaches inquired about
the vacancies adds credence to that stance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been absolutely great working with Coach O'Leary,'' says
new defensive line coach Dave Sollazzo, ``because No. 1, he cares
about his coaches very much.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, he expects you to work hard, but he's an
outstanding student of the game.... I've already learned so much.''
</P>
<P>
   Sollazzo, along with first-year defensive backs coach Paul
Ferraro and new defensive ends/special teams coach Danny Crossman,
have been hired to shore up a defense that surrendered an average
of nearly 400 yards per game a year ago. And they will be guided by
former Tech linebackers coach Ted Roof, the Jackets' third
defensive coordinator in as many years.
</P>
<P>
   After last season, in which Tech was 10-2, shared the ACC title
with Florida State and finished ranked No. 9 in the country,
defensive coordinator Randy Edsall, defensive line coach Lance
Thompson, and special teams and ends coach Bob Casullo departed.
</P>
<P>
   Edsall was hired as head coach at Connecticut. Thompson moved to
Alabama to be an assistant, and Casullo went to Michigan State for
the same reason.
</P>
<P>
   With an opportunity to rebuild, O'Leary, the defensive
coordinator of Tech's 1990 co-national championship team, came up
with a wish list: ``I was looking for good teachers, guys who can
communicate and get maximum potential out of what they have to work
with.''
</P>
<P>
   It appears O'Leary hit the mark. Each practice session is filled
with their commands:
</P>
<P>
   ``Stop and think about what you're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Look for your keys.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Listen to me.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not hard to spot Sollazzo. Just follow the booming voice
and you will find the Citadel graduate and 10-year college
assistant exhorting his troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``The defensive line position is always the holler guy,''
O'Leary said. ``I can see Sollazzo starting to have an impact, and
I see (the players) taking to his coaching, which is critical
because that is an area where we have to play better.''
</P>
<P>
   Sollazzo says he is comfortable with his boss' directive.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had to get mentally tough. That's the key,'' he said.
``They all have the ability. But at our position, defensive line,
it's a very tough job.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're not enthusiastic about what you're doing, you're not
going to be able to put up with all the elements up in there _
people blocking at you from every side. You've go to stay
focused.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferraro, a 17-year college coaching veteran, spent the past
eight seasons at Bowling Green as defensive coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can see that experience at work,'' O'Leary said. ``He
picks up matchups really quick.''
</P>
<P>
   Crossman, 32, played at Kansas and Pitt, and in the NFL and
WLAF. He was at Central Florida the past two seasons. An energetic,
hands-on sort, Crossman often lines up to demonstrate techniques.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been at this place eight months, and by now, everybody
knows what I'm about,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It's coincidence that all three coached at the mid-major school
level or below. To them, though, football is football.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all fundamentals and effort,'' Sollazzo said. ``Where I
coach, it doesn't matter what level you're at.''

Business is good because of it. Customers like to talk to Smith
about his NASCAR career. From 1949-64, Smith, who lived in Sandy
Springs, Ga., an Atlanta suburb, raced in 263 NASCAR races and won
21. He was named NASCAR's Most Popular Driver in 1959. ``I could go
run in Atlanta, a 25- or 30- or 50-lap race right near home and
make $500,'' Smith said. ``Like Tim Flock _ he'd get in his car or
ride with somebody in a tow truck, go all the way to Bangor, Maine,
to run a race that paid $800. I'd run the Peach Bowl in Atlanta,
make $500 and it didn't cost me $3 for gas and oil to run and to
get there and back.'' (Levine, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). 41.

<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ With victims complaining bitterly about a
lack of government authority to help them recover from Tuesday's
shattering earthquake, the Turkish army entered the rescue and
cleanup effort Saturday after spending days on the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews in devastated towns, many survivors asked,
``Devlet nerede?'' _ ``Where is the state?'' And on Saturday
political leaders sought to calm public anger over the often
chaotic rescue effort, as the death toll from the disaster passed
12,000, and was steadily rising.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, anyone suffering from this disaster asks where the
state is,'' President Suleyman Demirel said Saturday. But he said
people should not expect the government to ``work miracles.''
</P>
<P>
   Soldiers were sent to several devastated towns to pick up
garbage, which has been rotting in the hot sun and could be a
source of disease. They were expected to assume more tasks in the
coming days. The military chief of staff, Gen. Huseyin Kivrikoglu,
said he had met with Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit, but gave no
details of their talks.
</P>
<P>
   After that meeting, television stations reported that the
governors of three provinces in the earthquake zone were about to
be dismissed for their failure to organize effective relief
efforts. A deputy prime minister was assigned to try to put out the
blaze that has consumed the country's largest oil refinery, which
was still smoldering as foreign pilots complained that the aerial
fire-fighting operation had been poorly organized.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government decided that it could handle the quake by
giving further authority to itself and to governors,'' Kivrikoglu
said. He rejected accusations that the military had been late in
mobilizing to help victims, and told journalists, ``Don't
demoralize the soldiers.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Turks were astonished by the absence of soldiers in the
early relief efforts. The Turkish army portrays itself as a
quintessentially national institution that is always ready to step
in when the nation is in danger. But for several days after the
earthquake, it maintained a remarkably low profile, leaving the
rescue effort to civilian agencies and foreign volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for the general staff did not respond to requests for
an explanation of the army's position. One newspaper quoted an
unnamed government official as saying that civilian leaders ``had
coordination and communication problems with the military for 48
hours, which were resolved on Thursday.'' Another said the military
``suffered huge logistical problems on the first day after the
quake,'' but had since overcome them.
</P>
<P>
   An official close to the military said commanders feared that
thrusting themselves into the spotlight would give the impression
that they were running Turkey. The commanders have played a
decisive role in domestic politics over the last few years, and are
sensitive to assertions that they are intruding into spheres where
they do not belong.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a feeling that the military shouldn't just go in and
start giving orders,'' said the official. ``Civilian institutions
have to be allowed to do their jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   According to published reports, senior Turkish officials have
reprimanded the state-owned TRT television network for broadcasting
footage suggesting that government negligence was responsible for
chaos in the rescue effort.
</P>
<P>
   One of the officials coordinating the effort, Minister of State
Sukru Gurel, pledged to review complaints against contractors who
built homes that did not withstand Tuesday's quake.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will try to do our best, both in investigating and trying
to overcome this structural problem in the future,'' Gurel said.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of the Turkish Contractors Association, Kadir
Sever, issued a statement asking people not to blame all
contractors for shoddy construction practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is that it is too easy to be a contractor in
Turkey,'' Sever said. ``There are 40,000 contractors doing business
in Turkey, and most of them are unqualified.''
</P>
<P>
   There were several minor tremors in the earthquake zone on
Friday and Saturday, and thousands of people slept outdoors in fear
of more serious aftershocks. Most seismologists, though, say there
is little danger of another major quake soon.
</P>
<P>
   Now that so much time has passed since Tuesday's disaster, the
recovery of each survivor represents a near-miracle. At midday
Saturday an Austrian team pulled a 95-year-old woman from the
wreckage of a vacation complex in the seaside town of Yalova. She
told her rescuers that she thought others were still alive beneath
the same pile of debris.
</P>
<P>
   Many roads in the affected area were jammed for days by
well-meaning Turks who were trying to bring aid to victims, but
whose presence made it difficult for ambulances and rescue teams to
move. As the huge traffic jams began to ease, senior officials from
several countries toured the area. Among them were the Belgian and
Japanese foreign ministers, the chief medical officer of the
Israeli army and U.S. Ambassador Mark Parris.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one who visits here can help but be shocked by the level of
devastation,'' Parris said. He pledged that the United States would
``do everything in its power to help Turkey deal with the tragic
consequences of the earthquake.''
</P>
<P>
   American participation in the relief effort is expected to surge
in the coming days. Three warships carrying more than 3,000 sailors
and Marines, and equipped with operating rooms and other medical
installations to tend to the more than 30,000 people estimated to
be injured, are scheduled to arrive in Turkish waters during the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to assign soldiers to collect refuse was one of
several steps taken to help prevent the outbreak of an epidemic.
Medical teams have begun spraying disinfectants, immunizing rescue
workers against typhoid and distributing chlorine tablets for water
purification. Recovered bodies are being quickly photographed for
future identification and then buried. In the devastated town of
Adapazari, 963 bodies were interred in a mass grave.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many people, plus animals and food, under the
debris,'' said Rifat Kose, an official at the health ministry. ``An
epidemic could occur as they decay, but we are taking necessary
measures.''
</P>
<P>
   With dozens of countries now actively involved in the aid effort
here, the president of neighboring Iraq, Saddam Hussein, declared
that he was determined to provide more help than the United States.
According to news reports from Baghdad, Saddam is ready to offer
large amounts of crude oil that could be traded for relief supplies
or sold to raise money for reconstruction.

IN A PERSONNEL QUARTERBACK SNEAK, JETS QUIETLY HIRE MIRER
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Things move quick around here,'' said the New York Jets'
wide-eyed rookie guard, Randy Thomas, who probably has not caught
his breath yet.
</P>
<P>
   Only moments after the Jets had beaten the Philadelphia Eagles,
10-9, Friday night, Thomas heard his first Bill Parcells postgame
tirade and then learned that the club had acquired another backup
quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   That move came on the heels of four other big-name acquisitions
in the past three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Even the starting quarterback, Vinny Testaverde, did not
understand what the Rick Mirer questions were about during the news
conference that followed the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was unaware of that,'' Testaverde said about the arrival of
Mirer from the Green Bay Packers in a trade for a draft choice.
Mirer was brought in to fix the one major potential obstacle facing
the offense: What would happen if Testaverde were injured?
</P>
<P>
   That theoretical question resonated throughout Giants Stadium as
Scott Zolak's debut in a Jets uniform unfolded.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, he had little help when he replaced Testaverde at the
start of the second half. Only center Kevin Mawae was a
first-stringer, and he was in for just one series, to get Zolak
started.
</P>
<P>
   But Zolak could do little with what he had to work with. He
directed a total of six series and failed to lead the club to any
points. All six drives ended with a punt; in three series the Jets
got no more than three downs and out.
</P>
<P>
   Zolak, like the backup, Ray Lucas, the week before at Green Bay,
failed to complete half his passes. Zolak hit on 10 of 22, and they
gained only 90 yards. Like Lucas, though, he avoided throwing any
interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Jets' backup quarterbacks ended the first half of the
exhibition schedule having directed a total of 15 drives and
failing to cross the goal-line. In Lucas' nine drives against the
Packers, the Jets got only a pair of field goals.
</P>
<P>
   Those numbers contrast with the remarkably quick start
Testaverde has displayed this summer.
</P>
<P>
   He was on target for a second consecutive game in connecting on
11 of 14 passes for 130 yards. He produced his first interception,
but also found Wayne Chrebet for a 12-yard touchdown. In preseason
play, Testaverde has hit on 22 of 27 passes. Against opposing
first-string defenses, he has put points on the board on four of 7
drives, including two touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   So the point total shows Testaverde-led drives 20, backup-led
drives 6. Now there are three quarterback backups on the squad, and
Parcells will soon cut one, or even two, from among Zolak, Lucas
and Mirer. In punter Tom Tupa, the Jets have a versatile player who
has started 13 games at quarterback in his NFL career.
</P>
<P>
   Zolak was surprised that Mirer had been brought in. He learned
about it just before game time. When he took the field, Zolak said:
``We seemed flat. It was tough to come in and rally people. A lot
of players' jobs were on the line and we shouldn't have been
flat.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the quarterback uncertainty, it was the play of the
special teams that led Parcells to growl at the entire squad.
Perhaps melodramatically, he described it as ``the worst special
teams play I've seen in 15 years as a head coach.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad I wasn't playing specials tonight,'' said Lucas, who
usually does just that.
</P>
<P>
   As for his own future with Mirer's arrival, Lucas said: ``I've
got nothing to say. Parcells is the coach and he knows what he's
doing.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Special teams stalwart Chris Hayes described the unit's play
as ``just horrible.''
</P>
<P>
   It included a muffed punt by Leon Johnson that led to an Eagles
possession on the 1-yard line and subsequent field goal, a
mishandled kickoff by Kevin Williams, and faulty kick-coverage that
allowed two long Philadelphia runbacks: one of 34 yards on a punt
and a 31-yarder on a kickoff.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to worrying about backup quarterback, the special
teams' play has been a long-consuming concern for the coach. He
determined after last season that his backups, as well as his
starting linebackers, would have to play special teams and
attempted to find players at a high athletic level to do this.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Parcells' anger, his career preseason mark stands at
43-16, including 8-2 with the Jets.
</P>
<P>
   And while he blew up at the team in the locker room, there were
some significant positives. The Jets' defense once again was
stingy. The only touchdown it has yielded to the opposition's first
string came on Green Bay's opening drive, directed by Brett Favre.
</P>
<P>
   The Eagles, meanwhile, got only a pair of first-half field goals
against the starting defense _ one of them positioned by the
Johnson turnover on the 1-yard line. Mo Lewis led a sack parade
against the Eagles' starter, Doug Pederson, who was dumped four
times. Lewis caught him twice.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets also lowered their penalty total from nine at Green Bay
to six, saw place-kicker John Hall connect on his fourth field goal
in five preseason attempts, and actually did some good things on
special teams to offset the bad.
</P>
<P>
   Punter Tom Tupa, who launched a 51-yarder, had a 43.3 average.
Johnson generated a kickoff return of 21 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Still, to Parcells, this team that so many people expect to go
to the Super Bowl is ``light-years away from where we need to be to
have a chance to compete in this league.''

TOWNS COLUMN: CHECK-IN DAY AT THE SHORE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By IVER PETERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SURF CITY, N.J. _ Charles Marple left his family in the parking
lot of the Greenhouse restaurant to see about a table for
breakfast. ``She said at least 45 minutes,'' he reported a moment
later, and, strangely, nobody seemed surprised. But then, this was
a Saturday in August, and on the Jersey Shore, as everyone already
knew, Saturday is check-in day.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, Saturday at the shore is about relaxation and fun,
but the reality is all about waiting, and traffic, and children
needing a bathroom, and no place to park. For on every seaside
Saturday from June to September, thousands of weekly rentals
expire, and three hours later, thousands more begin for the next
tenants.
</P>
<P>
   For first-day vacationers caught between checkout and check-in,
the tingle of anticipation gives way to a tangle of minivans and
sport utility vehicles loaded with bikes, grills, boogie boards,
beach chairs and enough rapidly thawing steaks to last a week.
These workaday refugees inch their way over barrier island
causeways, grimly pursuing a week of fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody has a check-in day story,'' said Ken Sichau, an AT&AMP;T
executive waiting to move into a two-week rental. ``And if it's a
rainy day, it's a mess because the kids can't go to the beach and
you end up driving up and down the island.''
</P>
<P>
   But his wife, Jane, said, ``To me, it's just part of the
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' Sichau had to agree. ``You have a problem, but that's
the time you remember.''
</P>
<P>
   There are 32 real estate rental agencies on Long Beach Island,
and if they average 100 rentals each _ some do fewer, others many
more _ that means about 3,000 condos, apartments and houses, from
beach front to bay side, change hands on a given summer Saturday,
all more or less at once.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've talked about staggering the hours so everybody doesn't
have to come and go at the same time,'' said John D. Franzoni of
Oceanside Realty, one of the bigger agencies, ``but nobody wants to
change anything.''
</P>
<P>
   So the renters employ strategies. Marple, a postal worker from
Hightstown, N.J., got his wife, Pat, his daughter Fran and her
husband, Rich Seip, and the Seips' three boys loaded up and on the
road by 9 a.m. the other week, determined to beat the traffic that
backs up on the Route 72 causeway from the mainland.
</P>
<P>
   They got on the island by 10:30 a.m., only to find themselves
caught in another kind of traffic, in the crowd waiting for a table
at the cafe. ``You just have to be patient,'' Mrs. Marple said.
</P>
<P>
   The hours between checkout and check-in belong to the rental
agents and the cleaning crews. Tenants bring their own towels and
sheets, and they leave behind sand, and sometimes a little more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ice cream,'' said Jerry Hansen, Franzoni's partner, when he
opened a freezer door after a tenant had left one of his units.
``That's a no-no.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside, Gail Cook, a broker with HCH Real Estate, was also
doing her check-in day rounds, and Hansen introduced her to a
visitor. ``Hello!'' she said brightly. ``Do you do emergency
cleaning?'' She was just joking, sort of.
</P>
<P>
   People often try to outguess the physics of moving countless
people and cars off a narrow island more or less at once, and
sometimes small miracles are granted.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff and Christine Nordenholt have been renting here for years.
But this was going to be the first check-in day for their
11-month-old son, Alexander, so they decided to leave their home on
Staten Island a little later to let the rush pass, and to roll onto
the island around 2:30. What with the baby, it took much longer for
them to get going than they had expected, and yet they still
arrived within a few minutes of their goal.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Nordenholt was amazed to tell the story, and if it doesn't
sound like a big deal, you haven't experienced check-in day.
</P>
<P>
   There is even a class of renters who disdain the elbows and
aspirins that make check-in day special. So unwilling are they to
do the stop-and-go with the kids squirming ominously in the back
that they blow off that first Saturday night and don't bother to
show up until Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sunday!'' Mrs. Nordenholt said, aghast. ``I would never
consider that. Each moment is too precious.''

OUTDOORS: STALKING STRIPERS ON MARTHA'S VINEYARD 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By NELSON BRYANT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST TISBURY, Mass. _ Whenever you take a visiting angler
fishing, the wish to be successful intensifies. You want him to
have a good time, and you also feel that your reputation as a local
expert is at stake.
</P>
<P>
   I had an additional reason for wanting to find striped bass for
Lawrence ``Lucky'' Pyne of Milton, Vt., when we got together on
Martha's Vineyard, where I live. A friendly, enthusiastic
outdoorsman who is an editor-at-large for Field and Stream
magazine, he confided to me that decades ago when he was a boy he
would read my fishing and hunting yarns at the breakfast table
while munching through his Wheaties and vow that someday he too
would chronicle such endeavors.
</P>
<P>
   Lucky arrived on the Vineyard during some of this searing
summer's hottest days. I explained to him that for the past 10
years, shore fly-fishing _ which interested both of us most _ for
stripers on the Vineyard has always deteriorated by the third week
in July. This year, I added, such fishing had fallen off even
earlier, perhaps the result of rapidly warming water. I told him
that we probably wouldn't find striped bass of keeper size (28
inches in Massachusetts) along the shore within reach of our fly
rods, and that we might even have difficulty locating smaller bass.
</P>
<P>
   This didn't trouble my new friend. On our first trip, we took
our fly rods to the western end of Lobsterville Beach at Dogfish
Bar. We arrived shortly before sunset. There was a strong rising
tide. I prefer a strong falling tide in that location, but moving
water in either direction is the first consideration.
</P>
<P>
   Within a few minutes, Lucky was fast to a small bass of about
five pounds. He stayed put, caught three more of similar size and
had strikes from several fish that weren't hooked.
</P>
<P>
   I, meanwhile, lumbered up and down the beach in my waders for a
half mile in either direction, hoping to find a spot where larger
stripers were present. I found nothing. No bass were visible
feeding on the surface and baitfish were scarce. I eventually
settled in beside Lucky and had one hit before the bass departed.
</P>
<P>
   We then moved a mile to the east along Lobsterville Beach to a
spot where in recent weeks I had often found small schools of small
to medium-sized bass foraging along the shore late at night. Few
anglers were present, not a good sign, but we did encounter a woman
fly-fisher walking through the dunes who had lost a good bass.
</P>
<P>
   We caught nothing and departed at midnight. Lucky was pleased _
he had taken stripers from Vineyard Sound with a fly rod _ but over
the next few days I chafed at my failure to find better fishing for
him.
</P>
<P>
   In a conversation with one of my grandsons, I learned that he
and some of his friends were still having good luck fishing for
stripers in Tisbury Great Pond. Opened to the sea through the
barrier beach by man two or three times a year, this salt pond,
nearly two miles long and a mile wide, had been open for a short
time in early summer before onshore winds closed it, trapping a
considerable number of migrating stripers. The pond was still
closed and the bass were foraging throughout it, even into remote,
shallow coves, my grandson said, adding that, although most of the
bass were small, a few keepers had been taken.
</P>
<P>
   I called Lucky that evening. He was eager to try for the Tisbury
Great Pond bass, but had to head back to Vermont the following day
at noon.
</P>
<P>
   We made a 5 a.m. date for his last day. When I stepped out of my
house at 4:30 that morning, the fog was so thick that I could
barely see my pickup truck with a canoe on top 60 feet away.
Lucky's vehicle crept into the dooryard at about 5:10.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sorry, I'm late,'' he said, ``but there were times when I
could hardly see the white line on the drive up from Edgartown.''
</P>
<P>
   Launching my canoe on the pond, I fired up its little outboard
and within a minute the shoreline disappeared. Using a pocket
compass, I set a course for an area along the barrier beach where
the aforementioned opening had cut a deep channel along the pond
shore before it had closed. On one occasion, we passed within a few
feet of six Canada geese that simply paddled away into the fog _
conditions were unsuitable for flying.
</P>
<P>
   Reaching our destination, we beached the canoe and began to cast
from shore using top-water plugs and one-handed spinning rods as
blue claw crabs scuttled back and forth in the sandy shallows
before us, and, at our backs 100 yards away, the unseen surf
pounded the beach. We had fly rods with us, but wanted to cover as
much water as possible in the limited time we had to fish.
</P>
<P>
   The bass were there, and even though we caught none over six
pounds, we were delighted by the ferocity with which they struck at
our surface lures, sending bursts of spray aloft and occasionally
leaping out of the water when first hooked. We caught six or seven
and lost nearly as many more.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to find bigger fish, I moved us back up the pond to the
entrance of Deep Bottom cove. The fog was still so dense that I
couldn't find the channel I was seeking, but even so we took three
or four more small stripers.
</P>
<P>
   Our final effort, made when the fog was burning off, was near a
point a quarter of a mile inside the entrance of Tiah's Cove. My
friend caught two more bass. A few casts later, a large fish,
clearly a keeper, followed his lure to the canoe. He couldn't raise
it again, and it was time for us to leave.

   NEW YORK _ The New York Legislature has weathered some
tumultuous years, but the 222nd session left even Albany veterans
shaking their heads at the partisan fisticuffs and sullen
standoffs, the tendency to hunker down on routine matters. When the
session finally concluded nearly two months late with the Assembly
recessing around 3 a.m. on Aug. 6, members leaving the chambers
seemed relieved that it was over.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, it wasn't. The last hours were marked by the same
disarray that was apparent all year: The traditional
down-to-the-wire agreements between the governor and the
Legislature could not be immediately translated into laws because
leaders of the Republican-controlled state Senate had ended the
session in frustration several hours earlier, while the Assembly
continued meeting. The Senate is now scheduled to approve those
bills in a short special session in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   To many lawmakers, it was an exasperating coda to an
unsatisfying and unproductive session, one that began with big
hopes but yielded a budget that was tied for the latest in state
history. Relations between Gov. George Pataki, a Republican, and
the Democrats in control of the Assembly were more prickly than
ever, and in the spring, the budget stalemate essentially thwarted
progress on everything else for weeks.
</P>
<P>
   There was one major issue that drew consensus during that time.
Legislative leaders of both parties, eager to win the favor of
voters in a suburban special election, swiftly and unexpectedly
repealed the decades-old tax on commuters who work in New York
City.
</P>
<P>
   As the session wound down, lawmakers agreed to stiffen penalties
for stalking and for blocking abortion clinics, expand the state's
database of DNA specimens from criminals, and allow the
construction of new power plants. But talks on many important
matters, from revamping the state's drug laws to writing new rules
for polluted industrial sites, were abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 8,807 bills introduced in the Assembly, 1,606 passed,
officials said. In the Senate, 6,117 bills were introduced, and
1,432 passed. A total of 715 bills passed both houses, a relatively
low figure compared with recent years. Of those, the governor has
signed 409 and vetoed 13. The remaining ones are awaiting his
decision on whether to sign.
</P>
<P>
   The following were the major actions of the session:
</P>
<P>
   The Budget
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature completed passage of the 1999-2000 budget in the
early morning hours of Aug. 4, tying the record for tardiness set
in 1997 by going 126 days into the fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   But the delay was misleading. Once the governor agreed to
negotiate actively with legislative leaders, it took just a month
to settle the outlines of the budget, and another month to hammer
out the details, draft it and pass it. And while a record for
lateness would suggest a difficult budget filled with sacrifice,
the final $73.3 billion package gave everyone enough to claim
victory.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the budget raises spending 3.8 percent, though the part
generated from state taxes will rise more slowly. The increase is
larger than the governor had wanted, though still modest for such
flush times, and considerably smaller than what the Democrats had
sought.
</P>
<P>
   At Pataki's insistence, the budget spends none of the $1.8
billion surplus that accumulated during the last fiscal year.
Instead, it will be salted away to ease the way for tax cuts that
are to take effect next year and the year after.
</P>
<P>
   The governor also succeeded in nearly doubling spending on
child-care subsidies for the poor, to more than $800 million, an
effort that is seen as crucial to helping parents move from welfare
to work.
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature beat back the governor's proposed cuts to
Medicaid and education, and the budget even raises aid to local
school districts by more than $900 million, a record sum, to a
total of more than $12 billion. The Assembly Democrats made sure
that it also expanded a program to provide prekindergarten classes
and reduce class sizes in the early grades.
</P>
<P>
   The basic outlines of the budget are about what the Senate
Republicans had proposed all along, and they also secured more than
$400 million a year in new tax cuts that they had sought. The
budget also reflects more than $1 billion in tax cuts that were
passed in previous years, and are now going into effect.
</P>
<P>
   Crime and Justice
</P>
<P>
   LEGISLATION ENACTED
</P>
<P>
   Makes it a felony, rather than a misdemeanor, to cause extreme
pain or death to a domestic animal, raising the maximum penalty to
two years in prison and a $5,000 fine, rather than one year and
$1,000.
</P>
<P>
   Requires the Parole Board to keep the identity of crime victims
confidential in certain instances.
</P>
<P>
   Makes it a crime to make a false bomb report, punishable by
having to pay restitution up to $10,000.

future crimes. (The Assembly has passed this bill and the Senate

RECALLING YUSUF HAWKINS AND THE HATE THAT KILLED HIM
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By SUSAN SACHS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Ten years ago Monday, Moses Stewart lost his child to
one of New York City's most wrenching hate crimes. His son, Yusuf
Hawkins, then 16, was attacked by a mob of bat-wielding white
youths and shot to death in the Bensonhurst section of Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very hard to watch your children die,'' Stewart said
Saturday, in an emotional speech to friends and supporters in
Harlem. ``Look over at the children in this room and imagine their
life's blood running out of them for no other reason than that
someone deemed them less than human because of the color of their
skin.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he lifted a white handkerchief to his eyes and wiped away
tears. ``He died for something I did,'' Stewart continued, as
shouts of ``no, no'' rang from the audience. ``I'm the one who gave
him his color. He was born black because of me.''
</P>
<P>
   The killing of Yusuf Hawkins on Aug. 23, 1989, held up a mirror
to the city and the neighborhood. The image that looked back was
ugly enough to shake up the political establishment and fortify a
civil rights movement that has since rallied thousands for
demonstrations against police brutality and racism.
</P>
<P>
   Black protesters and members of Hawkins' family who marched
through Bensonhurst after the shooting were cursed by the
residents, hit with pieces of food and spat upon. They were taunted
with chants of ``useless, useless,'' a play on the name ``Yusuf.''
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks after the killing, David Dinkins, who went on to
become the city's first black mayor, beat three-term incumbent
Mayor Edward Koch in the Democratic mayoral primary. The changing
of the guard was attributed, in part, to the Bensonhurst uproar.
</P>
<P>
   Racial tensions from the killing ran strong for years. In 1991,
when he led another march through the largely white neighborhood to
protest some of the verdicts in the Hawkins case, the Rev. Al
Sharpton was stabbed in the chest with a steak knife by a young
white man.
</P>
<P>
   Eight men were eventually tried in connection with the Hawkins
killing. One was convicted of murder, four others were convicted of
lesser charges including weapons possession and rioting, and three
were acquitted of all charges. Keith Mondello, who spent eight
years in prison for organizing the gang of youths that attacked
Hawkins, was released this year and met with Stewart to offer his
apologies.
</P>
<P>
   But Stewart, who now works for Sharpton's National Action
Network, counseling and comforting other families who feel they are
victims of racism, indicated that he has other concerns than
forgiveness. He said the same virulent hatred that destroyed his
son still stalks the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to watch out for our children, watch out for the demon
that is out there waiting to take their lives,'' he told the crowd
at the network's headquarters. ``Yusuf is not the first or the
last. They are out there.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the 10th anniversary of his son's death is, in many
ways, harder on him than the first months of grieving. ``I have
lived Bensonhurst personally,'' he said, ``and now I am living
Bensonhurst through the eyes and hearts and pains of others.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton's group organized the Hawkins memorial and had invited
several other victims of racial violence or their relatives to
attend. Among those who were expected to share the stage with
Stewart were Abner Louima, the Haitian immigrant brutalized by a
police officer in Brooklyn, and the mother of Amadou Diallo, the
Guinean immigrant who was killed by four police officers in the
Bronx last year.
</P>
<P>
   Both their causes had been taken up and publicized by Sharpton
and when neither showed up, Sharpton noted their absence,
indirectly but pointedly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people, you fight for them and then you never hear from
them again,'' he said, adding that some of those he had helped had
disappeared after they received some money and fame.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton was joined by the Rev. Benjamin F. Muhammad, who said
he came as the envoy of Louis Farrakhan, leader of the Nation of
Islam. ``The color of our people is a gift from God,'' he told
Stewart. ``We are the original man and the original woman.''

   SKANEATELES, N.Y. _ John Angyal wants to have his bologna and
eat it, too.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as the first family announced plans to vacation here at
the end of August, Angyal, the owner of the almost-eponymous Johnny
Angel's burger joint in the heart of this historic village, renamed
a signature sandwich the Hillary Special _ Full of Baloney.
</P>
<P>
   But even though he is every bit as critical of the Clintons'
politics and personalities as the proprietor of Doug's Fish Fry a
few doors down _ who has been roundly denounced for declaring that
he would not serve the president and his wife _ Angyal is hoping
the first lady will become the ``first customer.''

<P>
   ``It's a very popular sandwich,'' Angyal, 60, said as he showed
off a hamburger roll with three thick slabs of grilled bologna,
topped with melted cheese _ formerly known as the ``Politician's
Special'' _ which sells for $3.50. ``I hope she comes in and
samples it. You don't want to eat it every day, but it's good. She
should be proud.''
</P>
<P>
   Angyal, a former town supervisor who defines his politics as
``to the right of Attila the Hun,'' said he would be honored to
welcome a sitting president, though he can hardly stand the sight
of President Clinton and likes Hillary Rodham Clinton even less.
</P>
<P>
   A similar ambivalence runs through this community where
everybody knows your name _ among other things _ and it is not just
because Republicans outnumber Democrats 3-1.
</P>
<P>
   Come February, they say, you can safely shoot a cannon down the
main street, but in late summer tourists clog traffic so much that
it can take three changes of the stoplight to get through the
intersection downtown. Even without the Secret Service and hordes
of reporters, restaurants overflow with visitors in August.
</P>
<P>
   In a place where businesses have to get the approval of two
planning boards before switching signs, and a property owner who
cut down some backyard trees one morning had a complaint from the
building inspector by lunchtime, change can be a dirty word. Many
who supported the recent ban on malls and fast-food restaurants are
not so sure they want their little jewel discovered by the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It puts us on the map a little bit, but I don't want to be on
the map,'' said Louise Robinson, 75, a Clinton fan whose lakefront
lawn is the site of weekly chamber music concerts. ``I think it's
exciting, but I just don't want all this publicity. Really. We like
this town the way it is.''
</P>
<P>
   The way it is, is the way it has been for a while.
</P>
<P>
   First settled right after the Revolutionary War, Skaneateles
(pronounced, at least by locals, skanny-AT-less) was named, using
an Indian word meaning ``long lake,'' in 1804, when the first post
office opened. The town formed in 1830; the village at its center
incorporated three years later. Travelers have been staying at the
Sherwood Inn _ and natives drinking at its tavern _ since 1807. The
Krebs, a seafood restaurant where Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat on
a wooden rocker on the porch before he became president, is
celebrating its 100th birthday this year.
</P>
<P>
   Skaneateles Lake, a 16-mile stretch that forms the index finger
of the Finger Lakes, is said to be New York's cleanest, its water
the color of Crayola's aquamarine crayon. It quenches the thirst of
some 250,000 residents in the area around Syracuse, which is 20
miles east of here.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the homes around the crystal-clear lake have been passed
down through four generations, though in recent years, wealthy
business people have begun to replace ramshackle cottages with vast
estates, like the one where the Clintons will stay Aug. 30 to Sept.
3. The town's average household income is $62,000, though there are
genuine working people ``down the road,'' as the locals say, in the
neighborhoods north of the lake.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the White House nor aides to Mrs. Clinton's presumed
campaign for the U.S. Senate will say why the first family has
chosen this conservative community that few people outside central
New York have heard of. But the locals think it is obvious.
</P>
<P>
   A quiet, pristine lake where sailors often find themselves alone
on the water. Golf courses aplenty, including the country club just
over a mile across the lake where Clinton is expected to play with
his host and two other developers. A quaint two-street village of
antique stores and sweet shops that declared itself a ``stress-free
zone'' a few years ago to attract tourists. All just a half-hour's
drive from the New York State Fair in Syracuse, where hundreds of
thousands of farmer types will be on hand in case Mrs. Clinton
cares to continue listening.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Martha's Vineyard and the Hamptons, where the first
family has vacationed in the past and plans to spend this week, in
Skaneateles the Clintons are unlikely to be feted at dinner parties
filled with Hollywood stars and big-city notables.
</P>
<P>
   Skaneateles' far-dimmer roster of marquee names includes Tim
Green, the Atlanta Falcons' former No. 99; John Walsh of
``America's Most Wanted,'' and actors Alec Baldwin and Kim
Basinger, who sometimes stroll through town when visiting Baldwin's
mother nearby (rumor has it that the celebrity couple are scoping
out a $4 million estate adjacent to the country club).
</P>
<P>
   But the Clintons can earn points for visiting a resort town that
serves the upper reaches of the much-pandered-to middle class.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the village atmosphere,'' said Tom Shaver, owner of the
Arbor House Inn, a new bed and breakfast that is already booked
with White House aides and reporters for the Clinton visit, in
explaining what is special about his hometown _ where more than
half of this year's senior class made the National Honor Society.
``The idea that it takes a whole village. Well, she came up with
that. This is a good place for it.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The square-mile village of Skaneateles has 2,724 residents; the
town around it by the same name has 4,802 more. Local officials
said they are doing nothing special to prepare for the visit _
Supervisor Bill Pavlus, who is hoping to put a picture of himself
with the president next to the one of him and Gov. George Pataki in
his bay window, insisted that the new bricks being laid in the
sidewalk in front of Town Hall were ordered two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   While most residents are greeting the visit with a collective
shrug, there are already a few glimpses of red, white and blue
bunting and signs of a flourishing entrepreneurial spirit. One man
has been selling ``Clinton Go Home'' T-shirts out of the trunk of
his car, and practically everybody a reporter meets on the street
offers to rent his or her house (the chamber of commerce has a list
of 30 properties available that week, and the owner of Mid-Lakes
Navigation Co. says his office, complete with Internet connection,
can be had for $1,000 a day).
</P>
<P>
   Skaneateles T-shirts that say ``Where Presidents Vacation'' and
``Clinton Slept Here, Too'' are already starting to arrive. Donna
Stockweather sent Mrs. Clinton a $50 gift certificate for a facial
at her Hairtique Salon. Hilary Whitmore, owner of the Aristocats
and Friends pet boutique, has plenty of regalia on hand with
pictures of black-and-white cats resembling Socks, the first cat,
and has ordered special mugs ($20) with chocolate Labrador
retrievers and paw prints in honor of the first dog.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ordered half a dozen of them, in case his aides want to buy
him a present,'' Ms. Whitmore said. ``If somebody wants to put the
name Buddy on, we'll ship it to the White House.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, the White House has issued a vacation schedule
indicating ``No public events,'' and many locals are convinced that
the first family will stay secluded at the home of Thomas and Cathy
McDonald, where the 8,000-square-foot main house is shaped like an
M, and the beach is set off by slabs of stone a la Greek
amphitheater.
</P>
<P>
   But one can hope. The best bet so far seems to be Rosalie's
Cucina, the priciest restaurant in town, where strings of garlic
hang over the wood pizza oven, and a guy with a mandolin sings
``It's a Small World After All'' tableside. Rosalie's owner, Gary
Robinson, is friendly with the McDonalds, and, after the flap with
Doug's Fish Fry, the White House called to check whether it would
be OK for the Clintons to dine there (absolutely).
</P>
<P>
   In a town filled with, as Angyal puts it, ``Wascally
Wepublicans,'' many residents are quick to say they would not cross
the street to shake hands with Clinton. Others argue that the
office of the presidency must be respected, regardless of who
occupies it (those spouting this view tend to be Democrats). Lots
of people are talking about fleeing town to avoid the throng; lots
more say they will stay home, maybe watch the spectacle from the
lake.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about the impending visit, most talk instead about
Doug Clark, whose public pronouncements that the Clintons would be
unwelcome in his Fish Fry have spawned letters to the local papers,
calls for a boycott and, Clark says, about 200 private pats on the
back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I probably should have been a little more tactful and a little
more careful,'' Clark acknowledged one recent morning as he sat at
a picnic table in his outdoor dining area, surrounded by the flower
garden he cares for himself. ``I have integrity, I have morals _ he
doesn't. I'm not the type to serve him and get on CNN and in your
paper, and then when he leaves have people say, `Gee, Doug, I
thought you thought he was a jerk.'''
</P>
<P>
   So let them go down the block to Johnny Angel's, where the owner
is cracking jokes about the contents of his bologna _ pork from
Illinois, where Mrs. Clinton was born, chicken from Arkansas, where
she spent most of her adult life, and ``not very much beef'' _ but
has also ordered 100 extra Johnny Angel's T-shirts ($12 each) in
hopes of becoming the next Black Dog, the Martha's Vineyard
restaurant whose T-shirt was a footnote in the Lewinsky scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives us something to talk about,'' Joe Spalding, a member
of the school board, said after lunch on the red-and-white checked
tablecloths of Johnny Angel's. ``We'll probably talk about it all
year.''

ON BASKETBALL: NETS ARE BURYING PAST AND SEE A BRIGHT FUTURE
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A team that loses 68 percent of its games and ends the season
with two starters signed to 10-day contracts often winds up with a
fired head coach and a need to make some major roster moves. But
the New Jersey Nets, despite their disastrous 1998-99 season in
which they had a 16-34 record, will return virtually intact. And
they will do so proudly.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets viewed last season as if it were a necessary evil _ a
time to be humbled, a time to have the unpopular coach, John
Calipari, removed from the organization, a time to have nearly
everything that could go wrong go wrong.
</P>
<P>
   They do not believe the problem was the players. Barring a minor
trade that would send away one of the backup point guards, Eric
Murdock or Elliot Perry, or the signing of the Cuban defector
Lazaro Borrell, the Nets will have only one new player. And that
player, Evan Eschmeyer, a second-round draft pick, has a long way
to go to chip away at the incumbents' minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets deserve credit for not panicking. They subtracted no
one of significance and their only notable addition was to sign
Gheorghe Muresan, the 7-foot-7-inch center who is the tallest
player in National Basketball Association history.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets hope that Muresan, whose season consisted of 69 seconds
in the final game, is able to give them 15 to 20 minutes a game.
They believe such a contribution would enable them to contend for
the Eastern Conference title, assuming, of course, that Jayson
Williams, Kerry Kittles and Jim McIlvaine are healthy and that
Scott Burrell is in shape.
</P>
<P>
   Nine Nets missed a total of 176 games because of injury last
season, and injuries could be an obstacle again. While Williams is
on schedule to compete in the October training camp _ Dr. Russell
Warren announced last week that his broken right leg was completely
healed _ there are those within the organization who believe the
team's inspirational leader will not play basketball before
November.
</P>
<P>
   Even if he is healthy, it remains to be seen how strong the
well-worn Williams, 31, is upon his return. An undersized center,
he has been battered throughout his nine-year career, missing an
average of 26 games a season with injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Muresan's health will always be a question mark because of his
size and history of injuries, and then there is Kittles, whose sore
right knee was partly responsible for his career-worst performance
last season.
</P>
<P>
   The wiry shooting guard underwent arthroscopic surgery on May 12
and was unable to put weight on his leg for the next six weeks. As
is the case of Williams, the Nets will be happy if Kittles can
participate in one of their two daily practices in camp.
</P>
<P>
   Healthy or not, Kittles, who started for most of his first three
seasons and received a six-year, $50 million contract extension in
March, may end up coming off the bench. Coach Don Casey said last
week that, at present, his starting five includes Williams, Keith
Van Horn, Kendall Gill, Stephon Marbury and Burrell, who was signed
for one-year at $1 million last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``But Burrell's name is written with a light pencil,'' Casey
said in jest and in truth.
</P>
<P>
   As the sixth man, Kittles would still play 30 minutes a game
while backing up both guard positions _ Gill at shooting guard and
Marbury at the point. But Kittles is sensitive, and sitting him
down at the start of games could become a sticky situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Players want to play big minutes,'' general manager John Nash
said. ``And the guys that don't play are unhappy. Casey's got a
difficult job trying to keep the whole team in a good mood. But I
think that's one of Casey's strengths.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea of making Kittles a permanent sixth man was undoubtedly
conceived on the evening of April 16, when the Nets trounced
Seattle by 121-91 on the road. Burrell started at small forward
that night, hitting four 3-pointers to score a season-high 18
points as one of six Nets scorers in double figures. Kittles, who
had been struggling as a starter, was electrifying as a reserve.
Hitting 7 of 10 shots, he scored 15 points in 14 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   That game, in which Seattle was vying for a playoff spot, still
resonates with the Nets, who refer to it as proof of how good they
can be.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's an example of how I see us playing next year: running
and playing good, hard-nosed defense,'' said Gill, who scored 16
points while starting at shooting guard in that game. ``We have the
makings of a great team if everybody's healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   Signing Muresan and Jamie Feick, who along with Mark Hendrickson
started the final six games of last season after joining the Nets
on a 10-day contract, gives the Nets increased depth and
flexibility in the frontcourt. With centers Muresan, Feick and
McIlvaine, whose left shoulder injury has healed, Casey can give
the Nets a different look at times by moving Williams to power
forward and Van Horn to small forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``Talent-wise, I think we can match up with anybody,'' said Van
Horn, who signed a six-year, $73 million contract extension on Aug.
1. ``And I think we have a good coaching staff in place. All of the
pieces to the puzzle are here if everyone is healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Nets that ``if'' may be as big as their new center. &QL;

 &HT;    Memphis mayoral race has just about everything
 &HT;    By Anne Rochell Konigsmark
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEMPHIS _ He's the only candidate for mayor who wears a velvet
crown and tights, who calls women's breasts ``puppies,'' and who
could crush his opponents_with his bare hands.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Lawler, known to professional wrestling fans for more than
20 years as ``The King,'' is now known in Memphis as The Candidate.
Following in the footsteps of Jesse ``The Body'' Ventura, who was
elected governor of Minnesota last year, Lawler is running for
mayor as the anti-politician. He promises to ``run Memphis like a
business where the taxpayers are the customers and the customers
are always right.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Jesse made everybody aware that you don't have to be a
politician to win an election,'' said Lawler, standing in his
kitchen, which is filled with Coca-Cola memorabilia. He has several
theme rooms in his single-story, east Memphis home, including a
``Gone With the Wind'' room, a shell room and a crown room, where
he keeps two suits of armor. ``There's an idea out there that you
have to cast your vote for whoever is most likely to win, or else
you're wasting your vote. That is simply not true.''
</P>
<P>
   Ventura proved that, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Lawler, 49, knows he could be headed for a pile driver into the
mat; there are 16 people running for mayor, and in recent polls, he
trails far behind the lead candidates. And he is white in a
majority-black city now enjoying its first black mayor, who is
seeking a third term. Mayor Willie Herenton's chief opponent, City
Councilman Joe Ford, is a member of the most powerful political
family in town. Also running is Pepper Rodgers, former Georgia Tech
football coach and former head coach of the Memphis Showboats, a
team in the now-defunct United States Football League.
</P>
<P>
   All the long-shot candidates have one thing going for them:
There is no runoff in Memphis mayor's races. Whoever gets the most
votes on Oct. 7 wins.
</P>
<P>
   Lawler has another advantage: Everyone in Memphis knows him.
When he asks for a vote, the voter asks for an autograph.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have more name recognition than anyone in this race, and I
haven't spent one penny,'' he said recently while signing
autographs at a grocery store grand opening.
</P>
<P>
   Spending a day with Lawler is like hanging out with a movie
star. From the event at the grocery to lunch at Corky's, the city's
favorite barbeque joint, residents young and old, black and white,
male and female not only recognized him but approached him for
autographs.
</P>
<P>
   ``My son has decided who I am voting for,'' said Majdoline
Hanna, whose son, Meelad, 10, was staring in awe as Lawler signed a
picture of himself. ``To my pal Meelad,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's popular and everyone is hoping for a change,''
Meelad's mom continued. ``And just because he's a wrestler doesn't
mean he doesn't want to do things for his community. Look at Jesse
Ventura.'' Lawler, a Memphis native, has been wrestling locally
since 1972. He also wrestles for the World Wrestling Federation,
and is an announcer on WWF's Monday night show on the USA Network.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the most watched show on cable,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even people who don't watch wrestling know Lawler as the
wrestler who slapped the late comedian, Andy Kaufman, on the ``Late
Night with David Letterman'' TV show in 1982. Lawler will play
himself in an upcoming movie about Kaufman called ``The Man in the
Moon.'' Jim Carrey will play Kaufman.
</P>
<P>
   Lawler and Kaufman never revealed whether the slap was staged,
but Lawler now admits it was. He said Kaufman gave him the idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything Andy did was to elicit a response,'' he said. ``He
could not be normal.''
</P>
<P>
   Letterman, however, was not in on the joke. His discomfort after
the slap and Kaufman's subsequent cursing spree was genuine, Lawler
said.
</P>
<P>
   Lawler's wrestling persona has clashed more than once with his
candidate persona. While he is campaigning, he is barred from
appearing on ``Power Pro Wrestling,'' the local wrestling TV show,
because of rules regarding equal air time. Lawler's response: ``The
other candidates can wrestle too if they want.''
</P>
<P>
   And a local chapter of the National Organization for Women
lashed out at Lawler because his Internet Web site features
pictures of his girlfriend, Stacy Carter, scantily clad in bikinis
and nighties. He said all wrestlers' girlfriends dress like that;
it's part of the entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wrestling is a sporting event combined with a rock concert
combined with a soap opera,'' he said. And yes, they do know who
will win a match before it starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the entertainment part,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lawler wants people to know he's more than just a wrestler,
however. He has a seven-point plan to ``reclaim'' Memphis. He
shares with his opponents a feeling that Memphis is lagging behind
other cities its size in terms of race relations and economic
development. The city lost its bid for a $300 million federal
empowerment zone grant, and it lost a chance to be the new home of
a National Football League team. The former Houston Oilers went to
Nashville instead, where they were promised a new stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Lawler will have a tough time convincing black people to vote
for him instead of the two leading candidates, Herenton and Ford.
He also has competition from Pete Sisson, a well-known white
politician who likely will get an endorsement from the Republican
party.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless a white candidate breaks out of the pack and the other
white candidates pretty much drop out, and the Republican party
throws its full weight behind that person, (the winner) will be
Ford or Herenton,'' said Marcus Pohlmann, a political science
professor at Rhodes College in Memphis. Jimmy Hooker, a roofer who
is black, said he will vote for Lawler.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like the administration now, and with Ford, it would
be the same thing,'' he said. ``Ford comes from a family of
politicians, so it's the same old malarkey.''
</P>
<P>
   Herenton says he is not concerned about Lawler's appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a wrestler,'' he said. Asked to elaborate, he repeated,
``He's a wrestler.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford was not so dismissive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like Jerry,'' he said. ``And he has something, some appeal,
like President Clinton. You get around him and you can't talk. If
he gets out there and meets a lot of voters, look out.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ford is concentrating his efforts on beating the
frontrunner, Herenton.
</P>
<P>
   Herenton, 59, became the city's first black mayor when he beat
the white incumbent in 1991 by just over 140 votes. He had some
help: Harold Ford Sr., then a U.S. Congressman, came down from
Washington to campaign for Herenton.
</P>
<P>
   But as soon as the election was over, Herenton and Ford went
their separate ways. Herenton says Ford wanted too much power; Ford
says Herenton dropped him like a hot potato. Both say they now are
barely civil to one another.
</P>
<P>
   Herenton faced little opposition when he ran for a second term,
but this time, he has a crowded field of candidates to beat. Harold
Ford Sr., who retired from Congress and helped pass the job on to
his son, Harold Ford Jr., considered running for mayor, but decided
his consulting firm was too lucrative to leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``I anticipated making the bid, but I couldn't, so I talked to
Joe about it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Ford, 45, is not as well-known as his brother, who is
running his campaign. In fact, when people talk about the Ford who
is running for mayor, they often say ``Harold,'' and then correct
themselves and say ``Joe.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Herenton is leading in the polls, experts say the Fords
have a lot of admirers in the black community and a talent for
getting out the vote. Harold and Joe have been working day and
night to shake as many hands in as many neighborhoods as possible
before Oct. 7.
</P>
<P>
   Herenton says his record speaks for itself.
</P>
<P>
   He enjoys strong support in the black community, as well as
support from white business people who have liked his pro-business
attitude. And then there's Atlanta native Pepper Rodgers, 67, who
is so nonchalant about the campaign that he's been on vacation. He
will not accept donations from his friends. He has no bumper
stickers or yard signs: He wrinkles his nose and shakes his
white-haired head at the thought and says he wants to be the
``statesman'' in the race.
</P>
<P>
   And he has a unique campaign promise: If elected, he'll resign.
</P>
<P>
   Memphis has two mayors, one for the city, and one for the
county. Rodgers says the metropolitan area wastes money by doubling
up on services, such as fire and police.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need a consolidated government -- one head coach, one CEO,
whatever you want to call it,'' he said. ``So if I'm elected, I'd
surrender my job and the city charter to the city council and let
the people vote on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, he'd like to be that one mayor, and he's not sure his
plan would work, but the way he sees it, no one will know unless
someone tries it.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever wins, the race will go down as one of the most colorful
and contentious in this city's history.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent afternoon, Herenton looked out the window of his
huge office and watched the Mississippi River roll by. Asked if he
feels besieged by the onslaught of candidates, he said, ``That's a
good word for it. There's a lot of interest in this high-stress,
demanding job.''

U.S. RULING ON WATERFRONT PATHWAYS UPSETS SOME NEW JERSEYANS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By STEVE STRUNSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERSEY CITY, N.J. _ Claire Adamini says she has no problem with
a federal judge's decision affirming the state's right to require
public access to the waterfront next to private developments,
including the riverfront next to her apartment building in Jersey
City.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't mind. I honestly don't,'' said Ms. Adamini, 26, who
lives in the Newport, a private apartment complex that built a
waterfront walkway in compliance with state rules. ``I feel the
public can enjoy it as well. They're not intruding on my apartment
_ as long as they don't make a lot of noise and they don't
litter.''
</P>
<P>
   But some developers and residents say they are dissatisfied with
a decision that forces them to pay for pathways that will be used
by the public and possibly crowd their private waterfronts.
</P>
<P>
   The decision, issued Aug. 12 by Judge Garrett E. Brown Jr. in
U.S. District Court in Newark and announced last week, was in
response to a lawsuit filed jointly by the New Jersey Builders
Association and its national affiliate, the American Homebuilders
Association.
</P>
<P>
   The suit challenged the constitutionality of 1988 state
Department of Environmental Protection regulations calling for the
construction of a 30-foot-wide walkway along 17.4 miles of Hudson
River waterfront stretching from the George Washington Bridge in
Fort Lee to the Bayonne Bridge. The requirement, the builders
argued, amounted to an unconstitutional taking of property because
it said developers must build, maintain and allow public access to
a portion of the walkway along their property in order to obtain
required permits.
</P>
<P>
   Brown rejected the builders' argument, finding that the state's
waterfront requirements were ``well within the state's police power
in the area of land use regulation.''
</P>
<P>
   Patrick O'Keefe, chief executive officer of the New Jersey
Builders Association, said his group's members favor the waterfront
walkway but want public money to pay for it.
</P>
<P>
   He said no decision had been made whether to appeal the ruling,
which was hailed by state and local officials and advocates of
waterfront access.
</P>
<P>
   Ann Alexander, director of the Rutgers University Environmental
Law Clinic, said the decision could have national implications. Ms.
Alexander said the state regulations upheld in the ruling are
rooted in a legal principal known as the public trust doctrine,
which dates to ancient Rome and is implicit in every state law
designed to protect public access to waterways.
</P>
<P>
   In citing the public trust doctrine, however, Brown limited his
ruling to apply to only 15.4 miles of the 17.4 miles of shoreline
in the walkway area, the amount that was was once under water but
has since been filled by developers. Under the public trust
doctrine, Ms. Alexander said, under water offshore acreage
traditionally has been reserved for public access.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Barry, president of the Applied Companies, a major
developer of the waterfront, said he did not support the builders'
lawsuit. But Barry said he shared O'Keefe's belief that developers
should not have to pay for the walkway. ``What is wrong with
spreading the cost to everybody?'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Brown also ruled that developers ``do not have the right to
exclude public access'' to the waterfront, a finding that upset
some residents.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Nadia Sapozhnikov, 44, and her husband, Vladimir, moved
from Manhattan to the Shelter Bay Club, a gated condominium complex
in Edgewater, because of its spectacular views and its privacy.
``In case it won't be anymore private, we will just have to
leave,'' said Ms. Sapozhnikov, idling at Shelter Bay's front gate
in a late-model BMW station wagon.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Travers, 23, of North Bergen, the guard at the gate, said
privacy is the main reason most people choose to live at Shelter
Bay. ``That's why Celia Cruz lives here, because the paparazzi
can't get at her,'' he said of the Latin singer after letting her
stretch limousine pass through the gate.
</P>
<P>
   In another waterfront access case, the state ordered Shelter Bay
in 1991 to take down the barbed wire fence that blocks access to
its walkway from a waterfront path at the adjacent Veterans Park.
The development's condominium board appealed the order, and now,
eight years later, the case is before the state Supreme Court
following an Appellate Division ruling against Shelter Bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just totally unfair to homeowners along the Hudson,''
said Anthony Pugliese, a board member of Shelter Bay, of Brown's
ruling. ``All we want is to live in peace, live in harmony with no
worries about security.''
</P>
<P>
   In West New York, which is experiencing more residential
development than any other nearby waterfront community, Richard
Turner, the town administrator, said officials were ecstatic about
the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it's a fantastic decision,'' Turner said. ``And it
should put to rest a lot of the concerns that the Shelter Bay
experience could become the norm.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Keefe of the New Jersey Builders Association said no
particular developer or project prompted the suit, and that its
timing, a decade after the regulations were adopted, related to a
favorable U.S. Supreme Court case in 1997, not the waterfront's
current construction boom. In the case, O'Keefe said the court
ruled that conditions of a building permit had to be imposed on a
case-by-case basis, not a blanket basis.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon Southard, a spokeswoman for the state Department of
Environmental Protection, said only a few miles of the waterfront
path area remained undeveloped, and that several sections on public
property have been developed with state money.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday night, at Sinatra Park in Hoboken, a band, Skanatra,
that does Frank Sinatra covers with a ska beat, put on a concert.
``It's the best venue in the world,'' said Fran Sunbeam, the band's
lead singer.

 By KIT R. ROANE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was only noon and Motty Notis was already halfway
into his race along 13th Avenue in the Borough Park section of
Brooklyn. Sacks of electronics, Judaic books and a wide-brimmed
black hat were strewn about the trunk of his rental car, and
arrangements had been made to ship dozens of other items.
</P>
<P>
   But with one hand on the steering wheel and the other hand
holding the cell phone through which his wife in Los Angeles gave
more orders, Notis set off again. There were silver Kiddush cups to
buy, possibly a camera and, if he had time to get them, some of
those nice white shirts he liked could be jammed inside his bag
before his 8 p.m. flight home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the best place to buy everything for a Jewish household,
so people from all over the world come to shop,'' said Notis, a
26-year-old general contractor, before zooming off in his car. ``A
lot of people fly in to shop in the morning and are back on a plane
by the afternoon. This is just the beginning for me. I've still got
to get a gift for my wife _ it's her birthday.''
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, the central shopping district of Borough Park
would not seem world-class. Parking is difficult, upscale
restaurants are few, and there are none of the famed stores that
draw shoppers to Manhattan _ like Bloomingdale's, Barney's and
Tiffany.
</P>
<P>
   But driven by the density and entrepreneurial spirit of its
Jewish population, especially over the last few years, Borough Park
has become what the Lower East Side used to be, the place for
Orthodox Jews to shop. On any day but the Sabbath, the mile-long
strip of storefronts is teeming with people in search of everything
from kosher groceries and refined flatware to electronic equipment.
The reason they come, they say, is simple: to get high quality,
great selection and competitive prices.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike the Lower East Side of decades ago, 13th Avenue has
developed a global reach because of the ease of air transportation
and the Internet. Many of the businesses have their own Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   The area has become so bustling that a 52-room kosher hotel
opened three weeks ago on 13th Avenue, the first hotel to rise in
Borough Park in more than a decade and one of the few to be built
in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has become our Manhattan,'' said Max Schwartzberg, who came
to Borough Park from Tel Aviv to shop and conduct business, and was
staying at the hotel. ``I swear, 50 percent of the people on my
flight were coming here to shop.''
</P>
<P>
   Schwartzberg represents only one strand of a diverse and
far-flung clientele that can be found walking in and out of the
stores. The shoppers may be Hasidim: Bobovers, Satmars, Viznitzers
or members of smaller sects in New York. Or they may be modern
Orthodox, coming from Belgium, France, Israel, South America or
anywhere in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The neighborhood itself, which began attracting Jewish
immigrants around 1900, now holds the largest concentration of Jews
in the country and has become one of the world's most Orthodox.
Much of the commercial growth has been created by members of a
younger generation who prefer to do business with other Jews. Many
have become entrepreneurs, according to Egon Mayer, the director of
the Center for Jewish Studies at the City University of New York
and the author of a book about Borough Park called ``From Suburb to
Shtetl'' (Temple University Press, 1979).
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an ethnic village that has been able to broadcast its
wares,'' Mayer said, ``a community that was historically much more
insular but is now being able to make its presence known through
the world.''
</P>
<P>
   In doing so, it has also become one of the richest Jewish
communities, drawing many banking concerns. Charles J. Hamm,
chairman, president and chief executive of the 45-branch
Independence Community Bank, said he opened the bank's first branch
on 16th Avenue 10 years ago and then opened another on 13th Avenue
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went from zero deposits to more than $350 million in these
two branches,'' he said, adding that the average branch has around
$110 million in deposits. ``It's just a hotbed of merchants and one
of the most vital economic locations in the United States.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Most days, shoppers cram the sidewalks, and cars back up for
blocks as everyone converges on the busy thoroughfare. At the many
groceries and bakeries that dot the avenue, a dozen kinds of
gefilte fish and rugelach line the shelves, while every form and
size of modest clothing _ from felt bend-up hats to the long black
coats called kapotes _ can be found at haberdasheries and tailor
shops. Silver shops line the avenue, catering to every conceivable
religious and social occasion, while some of the country's largest
selections of Jewish books, records and videos can be found _ or,
increasingly, ordered over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``In places like London or Paris, you don't have the
concentration that warrants this diverse array of specialty goods:
I mean, where can you get a fur streimel?'' asked Mayer, speaking
of the beaver-wrapped hats popular among some Hasidim. ``I wouldn't
believe it if I hadn't seen it with my own eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayer can point to his own cousin in Sao Paulo, Brazil, who said
he came to Borough Park five to six times a year to stock up on
kosher food and other Jewish goods.
</P>
<P>
   That cousin, Sandor Friedlander, said in a telephone interview
that he could not find many kosher items in Brazil, adding that he
tended to keep a low profile about his trips so that neighbors
would not pester him to bring back items for them, too. ``I have
enough orders for my own family,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not only out-of-towners who are attracted to the
variety offered in Borough Park. ``I came from Flatbush to buy my
granddaughter an engagement gift,'' said Eva Fertszfeld as she
shopped in one silver store. ``You just can't find this selection
and price anywhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Lower East Side's commerce has ceased to be Jewish
except for a few bakeries and stores, Borough Park's wares continue
to expand.
</P>
<P>
   Doron Food Corp., which makes a kosher frozen pizza that is
shipped around the country and to Canada, is moving its
5,000-pizzas-a-week operation from lower Manhattan to Borough Park.
The move was partly to get more space and partly for the name
recognition the Brooklyn area had around the world for fine kosher
products, said Ari Fishbaum, who owns the business with his
brother, Eddie.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, several local developers opened Avenue Plaza Hotel,
an eight-story kosher hotel on 13th Avenue and 47th Street. After
three weeks in operation, half its 52 rooms are occupied. And it is
booked solid from the end of this month through mid-November, said
Nathan Tessler, the general manager, even though its rates _ from
$150 to $450 a night _ rival those of many hotels in Manhattan. He
said the owners were considering doubling its size within two
years.
</P>
<P>
   The hotel offers many things those Manhattan hotels lack,
including a kosher kitchen and a mezuzah outside each door. During
the Sabbath, when it is forbidden for Jews to labor, an elevator
automatically stops on every floor so that no button has to be
pushed, and a hotel staff member can be called to turn lights on
and off for guests.
</P>
<P>
   Mosha Reich, a real estate developer from Tel Aviv, heard about
the hotel from friends before his latest trip to New York and
quickly booked a room. ``I used to stay in Manhattan, but there I
can only find a couple of places to pray, so every day it is a
problem,'' he said. ``Here everything is nearby. I don't think I
would ever go back'' to Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Such sentiments have fed the growth of local businesses, many of
which have tailored their appeal to overseas customers. Eagle
Electronics, which has an international mail order and Internet
business from its 13th Avenue store, does a brisk trade in the
220-volt appliances used overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Eichlers, one of the largest sellers of Jewish books in the
world, sits across the avenue at 50th Street and last year doubled
its size. About 30 percent of the store's business comes from
out-of-state customers, while the 8-month-old Internet site _ which
also draws from two smaller satellite stores in Manhattan and
Flatbush _ accounts for nearly 15 percent of all mail-order sales,
said Moish Perl, a manager.
</P>
<P>
   Notis, from California, spent two nights in the Avenue Plaza
Hotel and hours buzzing in and out of stores. Just before he had to
leave for his flight home, he finally found a birthday present for
his wife: a cherry wood jewelry box.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just a day at the mall,'' he said, looking at the box before
readying for his flight. ``Now I'll have to come back and buy some
jewelry to fill it up.''

   The Captain of Hobart-Smith Moves Up to Big-Time Match Sailing
</P>
<P>
   Only a year ago last spring, Andy Horton, as captain of the
Hobart and William Smith sailing squad, led a team that was favored
to win the national collegiate title. It was an unlikely
opportunity for a fledgling varsity crew from Geneva, N.Y., that
built a reputation as ``the little club that could.''
</P>
<P>
   The team ultimately lost. But Horton has shown since graduating
in 1998 that he can win on the national level and beyond. Last
month, he won a gold medal for the three-person division in sailing
at the Pan American Games in Canada. And now he is taking on the
big time in match racing.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers of the Knickerbocker Cup, an international match
event being sailed this year off Port Washington, N.Y., have
invited the 24-year-old Horton to compete. The event begins Friday
on Manhasset Bay with qualifying rounds, and ends Sunday with a
two-boat final.
</P>
<P>
   The Knickerbocker, now in its 18th year, usually draws its
skippers from the top echelons of match racing. But the pending
America's Cup trials in New Zealand, and the match-race world
championship last week in Copenhagen, narrowed the talent list.
Enter Andy Horton.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a little intimidating, but it is the big leagues
finally,'' Horton said from Carlyle, Ill., where he won the
Lightning Class North American championship last week. ``I've been
training for the Olympics in a Soling, and my crew needs the
match-race experience. So the opportunity is really important for
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Horton, who is from Burlington, Vt., will sail with his Olympic
crew: Andy Herlihy of Dartmouth, Mass., and Drew Buttner of
Plymouth, Mass. The lineup of the other seven Knickerbocker
skippers includes top-level racers like David Dellenbaugh of
Easton, Conn., a former America's Cup veteran; Tony Rey, a member
of the Young America cup team from New York, and Tomislav Basic of
Croatia, a world-class match-racer. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Blind Sailors Competing
</P>
<P>
   Sailors who are blind or have varying degrees of visual
impairment are scheduled to compete on Wednesday and Thursday in
the ninth annual Sail Newport Blind National Championships. The
regatta, which will be sailed off Newport, R.I., is expected to
include seven teams. A fleet of J/22 sloops is being made available
by Sail Newport, a local sailing center, for the championship.
</P>
<P>
   Among those competing will be Paul Mullen of Melrose, Mass., the
defending champion, and Matt Chao of Boston, a three-time national
champion. Chao, who is fully blind, will depend on an on-board
guide to help him with directions. He will steer the boat by
depending on the feel of the tiller in his hand, the heeling angle
of the sailboat under way, and the wind in his face.
</P>
<P>
   ``The championship is becoming more competitive as we gain
experience,'' Chao said about visually impaired sailors. ``Time on
the water is everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Handbook for Novice Boaters
</P>
<P>
   The recent popularity of small craft such as kayaks and canoes
has prompted New York Harbor officials to publish a special
handbook for novice boaters.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot more people are kayaking around New York,'' said William
Winslow, spokesman for the U.S. Coast Guard Auxiliary in New York
City. ``It has become quite a sport. I think it's because the
water, especially the Hudson River, is getting a lot cleaner. But
many of the new people don't understand the currents. They also
don't understand that kayaks aren't meant to be launched from a
dock where there are tidal changes.''
</P>
<P>
   Statistics from the National Marine Manufacturers Association in
Chicago estimate that 107,800 small boats, such as canoes and
kayaks, were sold in the United States last year. The number is the
highest it has been since 1981 when 126,000 were sold.
</P>
<P>
   The 38-page information booklet was produced with a grant from
Boat/US, a national trade group. Carol Stanis of New York, the
author, said the harbor can be dangerous for small boaters given
its array of ferry boats, tugs, barges, ships and pleasure craft.
``We see that the number of people taking boating classes is not
increasing but the number of boaters is,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The safety information booklet includes local 1999 tide tables
reprinted from the ``Eldridge Tide and Pilot Book,'' as well as
basic rules of the road for New York's waterways. It is also a
resource for obtaining more detailed regulations, and for
contacting local boating groups.

SKANEATELES, N.Y., GETS READY FOR THE CLINTONS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (REPEATING to delete photo note)   (See also CLINTON-VACATION) 
 (mk) 
 By JODI WILGOREN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SKANEATELES, N.Y. _ John Angyal wants to have his bologna and
eat it, too.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as the first family announced plans to vacation here at
the end of August, Angyal, the owner of the almost-eponymous Johnny
Angel's burger joint in the heart of this historic village, renamed
a signature sandwich the Hillary Special _ Full of Baloney.
</P>
<P>
   But even though he is every bit as critical of the Clintons'
politics and personalities as the proprietor of Doug's Fish Fry a
few doors down _ who has been roundly denounced for declaring that
he would not serve the president and his wife _ Angyal is hoping
the first lady will become the ``first customer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very popular sandwich,'' Angyal, 60, said as he showed
off a hamburger roll with three thick slabs of grilled bologna,
topped with melted cheese _ formerly known as the ``Politician's
Special'' _ which sells for $3.50. ``I hope she comes in and
samples it. You don't want to eat it every day, but it's good. She
should be proud.''
</P>
<P>
   Angyal, a former town supervisor who defines his politics as
``to the right of Attila the Hun,'' said he would be honored to
welcome a sitting president, though he can hardly stand the sight
of President Clinton and likes Hillary Rodham Clinton even less.
</P>
<P>
   A similar ambivalence runs through this community where
everybody knows your name _ among other things _ and it is not just
because Republicans outnumber Democrats 3-1.
</P>
<P>
   Come February, they say, you can safely shoot a cannon down the
main street, but in late summer tourists clog traffic so much that
it can take three changes of the stoplight to get through the
intersection downtown. Even without the Secret Service and hordes
of reporters, restaurants overflow with visitors in August.
</P>
<P>
   In a place where businesses have to get the approval of two
planning boards before switching signs, and a property owner who
cut down some backyard trees one morning had a complaint from the
building inspector by lunchtime, change can be a dirty word. Many
who supported the recent ban on malls and fast-food restaurants are
not so sure they want their little jewel discovered by the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It puts us on the map a little bit, but I don't want to be on
the map,'' said Louise Robinson, 75, a Clinton fan whose lakefront
lawn is the site of weekly chamber music concerts. ``I think it's
exciting, but I just don't want all this publicity. Really. We like
this town the way it is.''
</P>
<P>
   The way it is, is the way it has been for a while.
</P>
<P>
   First settled right after the Revolutionary War, Skaneateles
(pronounced, at least by locals, skanny-AT-less) was named, using
an Indian word meaning ``long lake,'' in 1804, when the first post
office opened. The town formed in 1830; the village at its center
incorporated three years later. Travelers have been staying at the
Sherwood Inn _ and natives drinking at its tavern _ since 1807. The
Krebs, a seafood restaurant where Franklin Delano Roosevelt sat on
a wooden rocker on the porch before he became president, is
celebrating its 100th birthday this year.
</P>
<P>
   Skaneateles Lake, a 16-mile stretch that forms the index finger
of the Finger Lakes, is said to be New York's cleanest, its water
the color of Crayola's aquamarine crayon. It quenches the thirst of
some 250,000 residents in the area around Syracuse, which is 20
miles east of here.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the homes around the crystal-clear lake have been passed
down through four generations, though in recent years, wealthy
business people have begun to replace ramshackle cottages with vast
estates, like the one where the Clintons will stay Aug. 30 to Sept.
3. The town's average household income is $62,000, though there are
genuine working people ``down the road,'' as the locals say, in the
neighborhoods north of the lake.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the White House nor aides to Mrs. Clinton's presumed
campaign for the U.S. Senate will say why the first family has
chosen this conservative community that few people outside central
New York have heard of. But the locals think it is obvious.
</P>
<P>
   A quiet, pristine lake where sailors often find themselves alone
on the water. Golf courses aplenty, including the country club just
over a mile across the lake where Clinton is expected to play with
his host and two other developers. A quaint two-street village of
antique stores and sweet shops that declared itself a ``stress-free
zone'' a few years ago to attract tourists. All just a half-hour's
drive from the New York State Fair in Syracuse, where hundreds of
thousands of farmer types will be on hand in case Mrs. Clinton
cares to continue listening.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Martha's Vineyard and the Hamptons, where the first
family has vacationed in the past and plans to spend this week, in
Skaneateles the Clintons are unlikely to be feted at dinner parties
filled with Hollywood stars and big-city notables.
</P>
<P>
   Skaneateles' far-dimmer roster of marquee names includes Tim
Green, the Atlanta Falcons' former No. 99; John Walsh of
``America's Most Wanted,'' and actors Alec Baldwin and Kim
Basinger, who sometimes stroll through town when visiting Baldwin's
mother nearby (rumor has it that the celebrity couple are scoping
out a $4 million estate adjacent to the country club).
</P>
<P>
   But the Clintons can earn points for visiting a resort town that
serves the upper reaches of the much-pandered-to middle class.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the village atmosphere,'' said Tom Shaver, owner of the
Arbor House Inn, a new bed and breakfast that is already booked
with White House aides and reporters for the Clinton visit, in
explaining what is special about his hometown _ where more than
half of this year's senior class made the National Honor Society.
``The idea that it takes a whole village. Well, she came up with
that. This is a good place for it.''

<P>
   The square-mile village of Skaneateles has 2,724 residents; the
town around it by the same name has 4,802 more. Local officials
said they are doing nothing special to prepare for the visit _
Supervisor Bill Pavlus, who is hoping to put a picture of himself
with the president next to the one of him and Gov. George Pataki in
his bay window, insisted that the new bricks being laid in the
sidewalk in front of Town Hall were ordered two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   While most residents are greeting the visit with a collective
shrug, there are already a few glimpses of red, white and blue
bunting and signs of a flourishing entrepreneurial spirit. One man
has been selling ``Clinton Go Home'' T-shirts out of the trunk of
his car, and practically everybody a reporter meets on the street
offers to rent his or her house (the chamber of commerce has a list
of 30 properties available that week, and the owner of Mid-Lakes
Navigation Co. says his office, complete with Internet connection,
can be had for $1,000 a day).
</P>
<P>
   Skaneateles T-shirts that say ``Where Presidents Vacation'' and
``Clinton Slept Here, Too'' are already starting to arrive. Donna
Stockweather sent Mrs. Clinton a $50 gift certificate for a facial
at her Hairtique Salon. Hilary Whitmore, owner of the Aristocats
and Friends pet boutique, has plenty of regalia on hand with
pictures of black-and-white cats resembling Socks, the first cat,
and has ordered special mugs ($20) with chocolate Labrador
retrievers and paw prints in honor of the first dog.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ordered half a dozen of them, in case his aides want to buy
him a present,'' Ms. Whitmore said. ``If somebody wants to put the
name Buddy on, we'll ship it to the White House.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, the White House has issued a vacation schedule
indicating ``No public events,'' and many locals are convinced that
the first family will stay secluded at the home of Thomas and Cathy
McDonald, where the 8,000-square-foot main house is shaped like an
M, and the beach is set off by slabs of stone a la Greek
amphitheater.
</P>
<P>
   But one can hope. The best bet so far seems to be Rosalie's
Cucina, the priciest restaurant in town, where strings of garlic
hang over the wood pizza oven, and a guy with a mandolin sings
``It's a Small World After All'' tableside. Rosalie's owner, Gary
Robinson, is friendly with the McDonalds, and, after the flap with
Doug's Fish Fry, the White House called to check whether it would
be OK for the Clintons to dine there (absolutely).
</P>
<P>
   In a town filled with, as Angyal puts it, ``Wascally
Wepublicans,'' many residents are quick to say they would not cross
the street to shake hands with Clinton. Others argue that the
office of the presidency must be respected, regardless of who
occupies it (those spouting this view tend to be Democrats). Lots
of people are talking about fleeing town to avoid the throng; lots
more say they will stay home, maybe watch the spectacle from the
lake.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about the impending visit, most talk instead about
Doug Clark, whose public pronouncements that the Clintons would be
unwelcome in his Fish Fry have spawned letters to the local papers,
calls for a boycott and, Clark says, about 200 private pats on the
back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I probably should have been a little more tactful and a little
more careful,'' Clark acknowledged one recent morning as he sat at
a picnic table in his outdoor dining area, surrounded by the flower
garden he cares for himself. ``I have integrity, I have morals _ he
doesn't. I'm not the type to serve him and get on CNN and in your
paper, and then when he leaves have people say, `Gee, Doug, I
thought you thought he was a jerk.'''
</P>
<P>
   So let them go down the block to Johnny Angel's, where the owner
is cracking jokes about the contents of his bologna _ pork from
Illinois, where Mrs. Clinton was born, chicken from Arkansas, where
she spent most of her adult life, and ``not very much beef'' _ but
has also ordered 100 extra Johnny Angel's T-shirts ($12 each) in
hopes of becoming the next Black Dog, the Martha's Vineyard
restaurant whose T-shirt was a footnote in the Lewinsky scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives us something to talk about,'' Joe Spalding, a member
of the school board, said after lunch on the red-and-white checked
tablecloths of Johnny Angel's. ``We'll probably talk about it all
year.''

DONALD E. DEGNAN, ADVERTISING EXECUTIVE AND PROMOTER OF CROQUET 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., N.Y.)  (js) 
 By WILLIAM H. HONAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Donald E. Degnan, an advertising executive who helped guide the
sport of competitive croquet through a period of extraordinary
growth in the late 1980s and early 1990s, died on Aug. 7 while on a
business trip to New Orleans. He was 76 and lived in Palm Beach,
Fla., and Westhampton Beach, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a heart attack, said his wife, Connie Merlino.
</P>
<P>
   Before Degnan promoted the sport, there were only dozens of
clubs in America where competitive croquet _ as opposed to backyard
or recreational croquet _ could be played. But after his tenure as
a leader of the U.S. Croquet Association and the U.S. Croquet
Foundation, there are now about 250 croquet clubs and about 5,000
players registered with the association.
</P>
<P>
   The competitive sport is distinguished by strict adherence to
rules, handicapping, national ranking and standardized equipment
including a 105-foot-by-84-foot court. The prizes are slim _ rarely
more than $5,000 for winning a major tournament.
</P>
<P>
   The game was avidly played on the East Coast in the 1920s by
members of the Algonquin Round Table such as George S. Kaufman and
Alexander Woollcott and on the West Coast by entertainment
celebrities like Harpo Marx and Samuel Goldwyn _ all of whom are in
the Croquet Hall of Fame in Newport, R.I.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, after a spurt in the 1980s, the number of clubs is on the
increase again,'' said Anne Robinson, secretary of the association.
</P>
<P>
   In drumming up interest in the sport, Degnan, a World War II
fighter pilot, would tell beginners that he had nerves of steel on
flying missions with the Flying Tigers over Burma, China and India,
but that he could be reduced to a nervous wreck when faced with a
hard-to-reach wicket.
</P>
<P>
   He also compared croquet with the dog-eat-dog world of
advertising in which he earned his living. ``It's me against you,''
he would say. ``You have to work out your strategy and decide
whether to play offensively or defensively.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he was a fine golfer, Degnan described croquet as more
challenging because it ``involves less distance and more
precision.''
</P>
<P>
   Degnan became attracted to the game in the mid-1970s. Ten years
later, he was ranked sixth in the nation. In 1992, Degnan was
inducted into the Croquet Hall of Fame in recognition of both his
skill as a player and as a promoter and planner of tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   Degnan was a member of the Palm Beach Croquet Club and the
Westhampton Beach Mallet Club. From 1994 to 1995, he was president
of the foundation, a fund-raising organization he also served for
20 years as vice president and board member. And from 1984 to 1991,
he was a vice president of the USCA, which arranges tournaments,
membership, rules and other aspects of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the croquet clubs in the United States are in
warm-climate states like Florida, Texas and Arizona. The
association says the average age of competitive players is 45.
</P>
<P>
   Croquet is one of the few competitive sports that does not
separate players based on their age and sex. The U.S. National
Croquet Championship to be held at the Meadow Club in Southampton,
N.Y., from Sept. 27 to Oct. 3, has registered players from
teen-agers to those in their 70s.
</P>
<P>
   The game is not cheap. A regulation court, or putting green, on
which the game is played may cost between $30,000 and $50,000 to
build. Necessary maintenance is expensive, too. A private club like
the Pinehurst Country Club in North Carolina, which has three
croquet courts and a resident professional, costs members more than
$2,000 a year. On the other hand, the New York Croquet Club, which
costs only $200 a year, holds tournaments at the Sheep Meadow in
Central Park.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Eugene Degnan was born in New York City on Nov. 18, 1922.
He was attending Notre Dame when World War II began. He left
college and joined the Flying Tigers, the band of daring volunteer
U.S. aviators who scored victories against the Japanese.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, Degnan returned to Notre Dame and graduated in
1946. In 1955, he founded the advertising firm of Donald Degnan
Associates. In addition to his wife, he is survived by two
daughters, Lissa Degnan of Denville, N.J., and Diana Degnan Thorson
of Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Croquet wasn't Degnan's only passion. He worked hard to keep the
memories of the Flying Tigers alive as vice president of the P-40
Pilots Association and as a member of the P-51 Pilots Association
and the Hump Pilots Association. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Mario Vespa, a cruise industry executive, died on Aug. 10 at New
York Presbyterian Hospital after a lengthy illness, a business
associate, Antonio Cosulich, said. He was 93.
</P>
<P>
   Vespa, who was born in Savona, Italy, was a captain in the
Italian Navy during World War II, but during the war he joined the
resistance. He was discovered by Nazi spies and spent a year in a
concentration camp.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, he joined Fratelli Cosulich, an Italian shipping
company, which sent him to the United States in 1961 to establish a
U.S. office of the Home Lines, a company that operated cruises to
the Caribbean and Bermuda.
</P>
<P>
   In 1981, Vespa was appointed honorary chairman for life of the
Cruise Lines International Association, a trade group that he
helped found.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by a son, Piero; a daughter-in-law, Elizabeth,
and a granddaughter, Chiara. They all live in Rome.

FOR HOSPITAL SERVICES, PLEASANT SETTINGS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JOHN HOLUSHA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center is world
famous for its research and treatment. But at 67th Street and York
Avenue on Manhattan's East Side, it is distant from subway lines
and can be difficult for patients to reach.
</P>
<P>
   The hospital opened an outpatient clinic in June at 53rd Street
and Third Avenue in 190,000 square feet of space on the lower
floors of what had been an office building. In doing so, it was
following the trend to deliver more care to patients on an
ambulatory rather than an inpatient basis, rather then admit them
to hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   It was also seeking to hold onto its share of the medical
services market by establishing a more conveniently located clinic,
with a friendlier atmosphere than is usually found in a typical
hospital setting.
</P>
<P>
   The lobby of what is formally known as the Laurence S.
Rockefeller Outpatient Pavilion resembles the entrance to a good
hotel rather than a hospital waiting room. Original artwork
decorates the walls, soft music plays in the background and small
pools with waterfalls add to a calm ambiance.
</P>
<P>
   Upstairs, the diagnostic and treatment areas have been decorated
in subdued tones and designed so that changing rooms are adjacent
to imaging equipment, meaning that patients in skimpy gowns do not
have to walk hallways.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to create an environment that was as warm and
comfortable for patients was we could,'' said Dr. Paul Marks,
president of Memorial Sloan-Kettering. ``We wanted to make a
statement that we can provide high-quality care in a warm
environment.''
</P>
<P>
   The establishment of satellite facilities by hospitals is being
driven in part by the decision of more young doctors to forgo the
establishment of independent practices and instead to join groups,
such as the DOCS chain in the city and Westchester County, to share
costs and reduce risks.
</P>
<P>
   The Memorial Sloan-Kettering treatment center is now seeing 800
patients a day. In a few weeks, St. Vincents Hospital Center will
be opening its own cancer-care center in the old Port Authority
building on the block bounded by 15th and 16th streets and Eighth
and Ninth avenues.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Beth Israel Medical Center established a broader-based
treatment center in what had been the commercial space in
Zeckendorf Towers on the east side of Union Square. And the
Columbia Presbyterian Center of New York Presbyterian Hospital
satellite occupies three floors of an office building at 60th
Street and Madison Avenue to serve people who find it difficult to
reach its main campus at 168th Street in Washington Heights.
</P>
<P>
   Taking this trend to its logical conclusion, the Manhattan Eye,
Ear and Throat Hospital has proposed selling its main building on
64th Street between Second and Third avenues and using the $41
million in proceeds to establish or enlarge clinics in Harlem and
other areas of the city where specialized care is hard to find.
</P>
<P>
   Hospitals in boroughs other than Manhattan and in the suburbs
are establishing satellite facilities as well, but the tight market
conditions in Manhattan make finding suitable space a more daunting
challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Hospitals are setting up these satellite operations for a number
of reasons, according to Kenneth Raske, president of the Greater
New York Hospital Association, which represents 175 health-care
facilities in the metropolitan area.
</P>
<P>
   The most important is cost pressure, he said, adding that ``the
payers are looking for lower-cost alternatives to inpatient
treatment.'' Meanwhile, technological developments like laser eye
surgery and new types of chemotherapy enable treatment on an
ambulatory basis for ailments that once required hospital stays.
</P>
<P>
   The association says there were 11.04 million inpatient days at
hospitals in New York City in 1990. The figure declined to 8.94
million in 1997, the last year for which statistics are available.
At the same time, the number of outpatient treatments grew to 18.16
million in 1997 from 14.79 million in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Hospital managers are using these new treatment centers to hold
on to their existing patients and, perhaps, take a few from their
competitors. St. Vincents is opening its new cancer treatment
center in partnership with Salick Health Care, a for-profit
organization noted for its popularity with cancer patients.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone agrees that cancer care is a growing market with an
aging population. The managers hope that a new center plus the
Salick touch will attract patients who would otherwise not
immediately think of St. Vincents when diagnosed with the disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were a small player in oncology, only the 11th largest in
the city,'' said Leonard Walsh, the vice president for operations
for St. Vincents. ``I'd be happy to push that up to No. 3 or 4.''
</P>
<P>
   Finding space for these treatment centers in crowded Manhattan
has not been easy, hospital executives say. But it has become
necessary, as small outpatient clinics at traditional hospitals
have become hopelessly overcrowded.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were desperate for more space,'' said John Gunn, an
executive vice president of Memorial Sloan-Kettering. ``We were
swinging from the rafters here.'' The new space was designed by the
Perkins Eastman architectural firm.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, Memorial Sloan-Kettering officials have the late
Robert Maxwell to thank for their space in 866 Third Ave., once
known as the Macmillan Building. When Maxwell's publishing empire
collapsed in the early 1990s, Macmillan was sold and its offices
were vacated.
</P>
<P>
   Metropolitan Life, which took ownership, put the building on the
block in 1997 and the hospital bid $49.5 million for it in
association with Related Cos. However, they lost out to a $50
million offer by Witkoff Group.
</P>
<P>
   Since the hospital is a nonprofit institution, it pays no
property tax on real estate it owns, so it was still interested in
making a purchase. After considerable negotiation, Steven Witkoff
decided to divide the structure into three condominiums: the retail
space on the first two floors; a hotel, now a Marriott, in the
building's tower on floors 14 through 31, and the Memorial
Sloan-Kettering satellite sandwiched between.
</P>
<P>
   The hospital bought 200,000 square feet of space, with Witkoff
Group retaining the two other condominiums.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing a high volume of patients at a location far from the main
hospital has forced the center's doctors and managers to an
all-electronic system for patient records and images. The system
will offer doctors and other medical personnel the ability to
access lab results, treatment histories and diagnostic images from
any of 550 computer terminals in the center's facilities. Use of
this system has cut the volume of paper by 40 percent since 1996,
officials report.
</P>
<P>
   The image of doctors peering at X-ray pictures clipped to a
light box belongs to the past as well. All the diagnostic
picture-taking at the center _ X-rays, CAT scans and magnetic
resonance imaging _ will be captured, viewed and analyzed
electronically. And because electronic images can be transmitted
more easily than a piece of film can be shipped, doctors can
consult with colleagues more quickly across the country and across
the world.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   It was the growing volume of outpatient care for a wide variety
of conditions at its main location at 16th Street and First Avenue
that drove Beth Israel to seek more space elsewhere. ``The
buildings we were in were designed in the 1950s and they mixed
ambulatory and acutely ill people in an unsettling way,'' said
Peter Kelly, chief operating officer of Beth Israel, which is now
working collaboratively with St. Luke's-Roosevelt and Long Island
College Hospital under the name Continuum Health Partners.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, officials wanted to eliminate a two-class treatment
system, in which patients with private medical insurance were
treated by private doctors, while Medicare and Medicaid patents had
to wait in an outpatient clinic to be seen by residents.
</P>
<P>
   After a joint venture with a nearby YMHA did not work out, Beth
Israel started shopping for commercial space, which was available
and still reasonably priced in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   When a corporate bankruptcy left 325,000 square feet of
condominium office space available on the second to fifth floors of
Zeckendorf Towers, Beth Israel paid $34 million for the property.
Kelly concedes that the space was not ideal, with a large central
atrium, but says that the location next to the Union Square subway
station, the third busiest in the city, was excellent. In addition
there is parking in the basement.
</P>
<P>
   And by January 1996, when the Phillips Ambulatory Care Center
opened, it was clear that Union Square and its surrounding areas
were well on their way to economic revival.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the area it occupies for itself, Beth Israel
leases space in the building to doctors in private practice who are
affiliated with the medical center. ``When we suggested combining
clinic patients with private patients, some people predicted it
would be a mess in six months,'' Kelly said. ``But four year later,
it still looks like new.''
</P>
<P>
   The Phillips Center space is laid out so each medical specialty
has it own small waiting room, to eliminate the ``take a number and
wait'' feel of big waiting rooms. All the waiting rooms face the
naturally lighted atrium, which has a sheet metal waterfall as it
centerpiece.The space was designed by Larsen Shein Ginsberg &AMP;
Partners.
</P>
<P>
   The pediatric-care waiting room is furnished with a big fish
tank, curved mirrors that reflect distorted images and the
inevitable television screen, while the orthopedic and spine
treatment areas are near a gym with weights and workout equipment.
</P>
<P>
   As has become fashionable, the breast cancer diagnostic and
treatment area is somewhat isolated from other cancer treatment
areas. ``Breast patients never see the hospital,'' said Marilyn
Halper, executive director of the Phillips cancer center. ``As a
result, they feel healthier.''
</P>
<P>
   In all, there are 44 separate medical modules in the center,
plus a store and a 90-seat auditorium for medical meetings and
conferences.
</P>
<P>
   Moving medical services to more convenient locations is a
reversal of a long-term development in the medical business, said
Susan Parker, director of Columbia Presbyterian's
80,000-square-foot midtown care center at 16 East 60th St., at
Madison Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, poor people came to the hospital to have a clean
place to get better, while the rich people were taken care of at
home,'' she said ``Now we are coming full circle.''
</P>
<P>
   The center was first opened in a different location in 1982 and
moved to its current location on three floors in the heart of the
Madison Avenue shopping area in 1994. The purpose, Ms. Parker said,
``was to bring the Columbia faculty to midtown.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Beth Israel's ambulatory care center, the Columbia
Presbyterian facility contains most medical specialties, including
a center for women's health, psychological treatment and dental
services.
</P>
<P>
   Patients interested in doing a little shopping before and after
treatments do not have far to go. Retailers including Ralph Lauren,
Donna Karan and Armani are right in the neighborhood. ``We're in
the middle of the Madison Avenue experience,'' Ms. Parker said.
</P>
<P>
   Just as technological developments, like improved chemotherapy
that reduces the side effects of drugs, have made ambulatory care
for cancer more practical, developments like laser eye surgery have
made community-based clinics more sensible than a central hospital
for Manhattan Eye and Ear.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last five to six years, there has been a paradigm shift
in eye care and there is almost no need for overnight stays,'' said
Paul Aschkenasy, a senior director of Cushman &AMP; Wakefield, who was
involved in the proposed sale of the hospital's 64th Street
building.
</P>
<P>
   ``They went from having an average of 120 overnight stays to
six,'' he added. ``The new equipment is small and relatively
inexpensive, so it makes sense to have four or five clinics
affiliated with local hospitals in underserved areas of the city.''
</P>
<P>
   If the transaction, which has been challenged in court, is
completed, half the building will be sold to Memorial
Sloan-Kettering for an expanded breast cancer treatment center,
Aschkenasy said, and the rest to private developers for probable
conversion to housing.
</P>
<P>
   Housing is also on the mind of officials of St. Vincents, which
has many of its business offices in a former apartment building on
West 12th Street. ``We need affordable housing for staff, but 50
percent of this building is offices,'' said Walsh, vice president
for operations.
</P>
<P>
   Since the growth of ambulatory care will inevitably lead to a
reduction in hospital beds, the space required by a hospital will
shrink, allowing real estate assets to be redeployed. ``If we could
convert this building back to housing, we might do a floor as an
inn for out-of-town patients,'' Walsh said.
</P>
<P>
   St. Vincents has been buying medical practices and establishing
clinics in the city's ethnic enclaves, which has produced some
unexpected developments for an institution that is owned by the
Sisters of Charity, a Roman Catholic order. ``We have a clinic in
Chinatown that is now open seven days a week,'' Walsh said. ``The
Asian community wants these services on Sunday. It's one of our
busiest days.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The latest St. Vincents venture is its Comprehensive Cancer
Center, on 15th Street between Eighth and Ninth avenues, in 70,000
square feet of what were once the street-level loading docks of the
Port Authority's Inland Freight Station. The center is planning to
start treating patients later this month, with a formal opening on
Oct. 4.
</P>
<P>
   Designed by the architectural firm of Gwathmey Siegel, the
center has a recessed entrance so that patients arriving by car are
protected from bad weather. The lobby is equipped with a concierge
desk to make arrivals feel welcome.
</P>
<P>
   The center has two fully equipped operating rooms and the other
manifestations of hard science, but the system is intended to
relieve anxiety as well as try to cure disease. In the
breast-treatment area _ isolated from the rest of the center _
several medical tools and specialties have been grouped to speed
diagnoses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The standard is to reduce the time to diagnosis,'' said Jill
D. Anderson, executive director of the center. She said
radiologists would be available to read images and pathologists to
analyze cells taken for testing. ``The pathologist will live
here,'' said Ms. Anderson, indicating that the doctor's principal
office will be at the center rather than the hospital. ``He can
read a slide and render an opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the goal was to be able to provide a diagnosis the same
day as tests are administered, avoiding the worrisome delay of five
to 30 days of the past.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the industrial past of the building at 111 Eighth
Ave., fitting the center into it was not simple, said Charles
Gwathmey, the principal architect.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to interact with existing mechanical rooms and loading
docks,'' he said, ``and there was a lot of existing infrastructure
_ pipes, ducts and so forth _ that we couldn't move.''
</P>
<P>
   The up side was that the building is strongly built, with a
higher ceiling than would found in a typical office building. This
was useful for the 4-foot-thick reinforced concrete wall and floors
needed to shield the rooms where radiation therapy is administered.
</P>
<P>
   Just as St. Vincents uses community-based clinics to draw
patients into its system, Beth Israel bought a chain of primary
care centers called DOCS to extend its reach into the boroughs and
suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Joseph Sozio said he started the DOCS operation in 1983 with
a formula of emphasizing convenience for customers. ``We started in
Westchester as a primary care office that was open from eight to
midnight, seven days a week,'' he said. ``The idea was to provide
people with health care when they needed it.''
</P>
<P>
   The DOCS operation began as Doctors Office Center, but later the
name was changed to DOCS after a legal dispute with another
company. It has grown to 25 centers in Westchester, Manhattan and
Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the DOCS centers have been established near shopping
centers and other retail locations, for visibility and convenience.
For specialized care there are DOCS centers staffed by doctors with
specialized training. Major surgery is referred to hospitals in the
Continuum partnership.
</P>
<P>
   Sozio said joining a group operation like DOCS is attractive for
doctors coming out of medical school and training laden with debt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Setting up an independent practice is both capital and labor
intensive and we are in the era of managed care,'' he said. ``With
something like this, you have the feel of a private practice with
the support of a larger group.''

MASSACHUSETTS TOWN GETS ITS TRAIN BACK 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By SUSAN DIESENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWBURYPORT, Mass. _ A new $55-million Massachusetts Bay Transit
Authority train station opened here last fall, becoming another
attraction drawing new home buyers to this seaside community 40
miles north of Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Direct commuter service to Boston was discontinued in 1976 when
the town declined to pay increased fees sought by the authority.
Its restoration is part of a systemwide expansion by the transit
authority in the '90s within a 50-mile radius of Boston. By the end
of this year, there will be 103 miles of new track and 22 new
stations at a cost of $700 million, said John Carlisle, an
authority spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   But until the station in Newburyport opened last October, the
last stop on the Newburyport/Rockport Line was nine miles to the
south in Ipswich. About 600 commuters a day boarded there. Now, 500
people a day board there and 575 get on in Newburyport for a net
gain of 475 riders, Carlisle said.
</P>
<P>
   The new service is not the only explanation for the surge in
home sales here, although it has played a part. Before Joseph
Mayer, 50, a financial planner, moved here from the landlocked
Boston suburb of Framingham last winter, he was driving 20 minutes
from home every day to get to the commuter train to Boston.
</P>
<P>
   He and his wife, Deborah, were looking for a waterfront
community with rail service to Boston when they bought a house
under construction in Port Village here, a 42-lot subdivision. Its
presence less than a mile from the new station on Route 1 impressed
them. ``We wanted the water for quality of life and the train
because it's the most efficient way to commute to the city,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Newburyport is a Colonial-era city of 17,000 with a downtown
that sits on the Merrimac River and offers a view of a vast expanse
of Atlantic Ocean. A 2 1/2 acre waterfront park with a boardwalk
has a harbor with public moorings for pleasure boats. The pristine
Plum Island Beach is about three miles away. About five miles west
of the center is the 480-acre Maudslay State Park, which has bike
paths as well as open-air concerts during warm weather and
cross-country skiing in winter.
</P>
<P>
   Economic growth in the region is the primary cause of the surge
in new housing construction, but Newburyport itself has also
benefited because it can offer both urban amenities and the charm
of a small seaside community. Clustered around the waterfront are
dozens of early 19th-century red Flemish brick buildings with shops
downstairs and apartments up.
</P>
<P>
   Since the late 1960s, an infusion of about $90 million in
federal and state funds went into redeveloping the city's
infrastructure. And over 10 years after 1968 about $12 million of
these funds, plus $7 million in private funds, were used to create
a pedestrian mall.
</P>
<P>
   The mall led to the restoration of dozens of the historic brick
buildings. Now these three- and four-story flower-trimmed buildings
are filled with shops, offices, apartments and a panoply of clubs,
cafes and restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   The historic renovations have doubled Newburyport's property
values, according to Byron J. Matthews, who was the city's mayor in
the '70s and is now chairman of North Essex Community College in
Haverhill, Mass. In the last two years, construction has begun on
more than 200 new homes: 120 single-family houses and 84
condominiums.
</P>
<P>
   This winter, work is to start on a 71-lot subdivision. In this
year's first half, meanwhile, renovations have been started on 210
existing houses, including many antiques, according to Dan
Raycroft, the city building inspector.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the new houses are being purchased by
out-of-towners,'' he said. ``There are even more new people moving
here than in the real estate boom of the 1980s.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the draws for buyers accustomed to the residential market
closer to Boston is substantially lower prices, according to Edward
T. Sullivan, vice president of Hunneman Coldwell Banker, in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   In this year's first quarter, condominiums in Boston's Back Bay
neighborhood brought an average of $445,158 for an
1,100-square-foot unit. That compares with an average sale price of
$283,056 for a single-family house, usually with at least 2,200
square feet of space, in Newburyport.
</P>
<P>
   A similar disparity is evident in the market for large old
downtown homes. In the Back Bay area of Boston, four large antique
town houses were recently sold for $1.5 million to $6.7 million for
10,000 square feet of space, Sullivan said.
</P>
<P>
   In June, Christopher and Teri Ebinger bought a three-story sea
captain's house, built 200 years ago on High Street in downtown
Newburyport, for $450,000. They expect to invest $150,000 more in
renovations, they said. After doing basic plumbing, electrical and
wiring work, they will convert the eight bedrooms on the upper two
floors into three suites. They expect to be at it for five years.
</P>
<P>
   Ebinger, 46, has a teen-age daughter who can walk to an
after-school job in the center of town. ``That makes it easy and
safe for her to socialize and make friends,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Newburyport prices may seem like a bargain to Boston buyers, but
the increasing demand for housing here has led values to rise
rapidly since the plan to restore rail service and build a new
station was announced two years ago. Average home sale prices are
up 20 percent so far this year from a year ago. In 1998, the
average sale price, $242,643, was 23 percent higher than in 1997,
according to town officials and realtors. A decade ago, a
single-family house averaged $153,000.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Of course, land prices have also been rising, reaching $150,000
to $200,000 for a 10,000-square-foot lot, up 25 percent from 1997,
said Albert R. Symes, the Wakefield developer who is planning to
build the 71-lot subdivision next to Interstate 95 here early next
year.
</P>
<P>
   In this rising market, therefore, most of the new single-family
houses start at $400,000, while the new condominiums begin at
$300,000, according to Evon Woods, a broker for Hunneman here.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, economic growth all around this city has enhanced
housing sales. The job market for technology, financial service and
high-skilled manufacturing workers is booming in southern New
Hampshire, just over the state line. The same is true along
metropolitan Boston's nearby beltways, I-495 and Route 128.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as the regional economy prospers, so will we,'' said
David M. Tierney, a partner in Prudential Harbor Realty here.
</P>
<P>
   The Mayers, who moved from Natick, were able to buy a new
3,000-square-foot house, with three bedrooms and four baths, for
$459,000. Mayer recently started his own financial consulting
company in nearby Methuen. His wife has set up her business, Dehaas
Advertising and Design Inc., in the bedroom over the garage, which
has a separate entrance.
</P>
<P>
   The subdivision where they live, Port Village, is being built by
Mesiti Development Corp. of Tewksbury. Early in 1998, the company
began installing roads, water and electrical systems. It is
building the project in phases. Of the 16 lots in Phase One, eight
homes are occupied, with five more under agreement or reserved, a
company spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Mayer, who does not make the daily commute to Boston anymore,
says he has found what he was looking for in Newburyport. ``We paid
a lot for a lifestyle,'' he said. ``It's about biking to the water;
the gourmet restaurants and theater downtown _ and the train to
Boston.''

 &HT;    EDS: Fixes Curry's age; typos
 &HT;    Tar Heels dependent on quarterback Curry
 &HT;    By Norman Arey
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHAPEL HILL, N.C. _ Ronald Curry was a disappointment during his
freshman season at North Carolina. The shooting guard averaged only
2.8 points per game, managed just 1.7 assists and grabbed 1.5
rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Oh yeah, that was basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Curry was a huge success during his freshman season on
the football field. The quarterback from Hampton, Va., was one of
the highest profile athletes ever coming out of high school. He
threw for 975 yards and six touchdowns and rushed for 419 yards and
two other scores in leading the Tar Heels to a 7-5 season. Curry
was voted the MVP in North Carolina's 20-13 victory against San
Diego State in the Las Vegas Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Curry was as big a success in football as he was an enigma in
basketball. The fact that he was forced into the football lineup
when Oscar Davenport was injured in the season opener and wasn't
counted on to contribute much in basketball may have had a lot to
do with his first year in Chapel Hill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I surprised a lot of people last year,'' Curry said. ``I think
the coaches were just planning on using me as a punt returner.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ronald's not just an athlete, he's a great quarterback,'' said
UNC offensive coordinator Steve Marshall. ``It's a semi-insult, to
my way of thinking, to call him an athlete.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ronald's much, much improved,'' said coach Carl Torbush.
``He's in complete command of our offense now. Over the past 10
practices, he's throwing the ball as well as anybody I've seen here
in 12 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Torbush, who was UNC's defensive coordinator before becoming
head coach, admits that having Curry does have its drawbacks. ``We
tried to sign quarterbacks ... and nobody wanted to come,'' he
said. ``We've absolutely got to sign one for next season. You can't
operate a program with just two quarterbacks.''
</P>
<P>
   Curry is backed up solely by redshirt freshman Luke Huard. .
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina opens its season against fast-growing rival
Virginia. But the Tar Heels, who struggled on offense last year,
may be a completely different team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, of the eleven starters on offense coming into the
first game, only three were left standing at the end of the year,''
Torbush said. ``But with the experience Ronald had last year, we're
going to be better. We have five tailbacks who I feel can
contribute. Last year, we had to move two fullbacks to the tailback
spot.''
</P>
<P>
   Torbush compares Curry to Charlie Ward, who won the Heisman
while directing Florida State's offense in the early '90s. ``Ward
was a special player and if we can put more good players around
Ronald, he has the opportunity to be that good. He's at the point
that he can make a good team great.''
</P>
<P>
   Curry says the hoopla and gaggle of writers and radio/TV folks
that constantly seek him out doesn't bother him. ``In my first game
in high school, we went into overtime and I scored the winning
touchdown and I've had a lot of press ever since,'' he said. ``I'm
just going to be the same old Ronald. I'm never going to change
personally.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've changed as a football player, I'm much better,'' he said.
``When I make mistakes now, I know the mistake I made. Being a
quarterback takes a lot. I know everything about it now.''
</P>
<P>
   As to which sport he'll eventually pursue, Curry shakes his
head. ``The decision is mine to make and I'm not even close to
making it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Over the summer, Curry shed the No. 13 jersey he wore last
season and donned No. 1 _ as if he needed any more attention than
he gets on the field anyway.

BETWEEN PITCHES, THERE'S A GAME WITHIN A GAME
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ The Velcro straps on Chuck Knoblauch's batting
gloves don't really need tightening, there isn't any dirt in his
spikes to be tapped out, and there's nothing wrong with the grip of
his bat.
</P>
<P>
   But before every pitch, Knoblauch, the Yankees' leadoff batter,
readjusts his batting gloves, with the particularity of a
Buckingham Palace butler.
</P>
<P>
   Before every pitch, Knoblauch uses the barrel of his bat to tap
his right spike and his left, as if he had just stepped through a
cow pasture.
</P>
<P>
   Before every pitch, he holds his bat directly in front of him,
stares at it, twisting and squeezing it, like some mountain climber
feeling for a safe place to hang on.
</P>
<P>
   Before every pitch, Knoblauch steps out of the batter's box to
go through this elaborate preening, the pitcher waiting all the
while.
</P>
<P>
   But the real adjustments are going on in Knoblauch's mind, as he
reviews the circumstances and anticipates the next pitch. Knoblauch
has been going through the routine so long now that is almost
subconsciously done.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't know exactly what I do, because I'm really
thinking about the pitch,'' Knoblauch said. ``Maybe the pitch or
the count, or maybe it's to slow that pitcher down a little bit and
get him out of his rhythm. It's all about getting comfortable. It's
kind of a fidgeting routine while your mind is at work.''
</P>
<P>
   It is part of what makes Knoblauch an effective leadoff hitter;
the game seems to stop during his at-bats. Knoblauch almost
uniformly takes the first pitch, steps out of the box, then often
takes the second pitch, steps out, and eventually the pitcher has
thrown five or more pitches to him and the pace of the game belongs
to Knoblauch.
</P>
<P>
   David Cone pitched to Knoblauch in the past, when they were
opponents, and Knoblauch's routine, in particular, didn't bother
Cone. He and Andy Pettitte and others said that when they faced
Knoblauch, they would try to time their own movement from pitch to
pitch so that when he was ready to bat, they were ready to throw a
pitch, rather than simply standing on the mound and waiting for
him.
</P>
<P>
   But Knoblauch's entire at-bat, taken as a whole _ his patience,
his ability to foul off pitches, stepping out of the box _ could be
exasperating. ``Maybe after a long at-bat, that's where it kind of
takes its toll,'' Cone said. ``You know you're really in for a
battle. I just remember wishing he would put the first ball in
play. If he was going to get a hit, then get a hit. I didn't want
to throw 15 pitches, and go through that whole routine. That's what
made him so tough, and difficult to face.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Jeff Nelson, the Yankees reliever: ``I don't like guys who
step out and take forever. I think that's ridiculous. But then,
maybe sometimes I walk around the mound and take my time, so ...
.''
</P>
<P>
   Every player has a routine. Before each at-bat, Bernie Williams
lays his bat down across the front of home plate, notes the spot
where the knob lies, then draws a line straight back, in the
direction of the catcher; Williams uses this to coordinate his foot
placement. Paul O'Neill, the Yankees' right fielder, steps out of
the batter's box and practices his swing, aiming his bat downward
at a 45-degree angle.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Jeter has taken to adjusting his batting gloves between
pitches. Cone recalled the deliberate at-bats of Mike Hargrove, the
Cleveland manager. When Hargrove played, he was known as the Human
Rain Delay, for all of his poking and preening and preparation.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Myers, the longtime closer, circled the front of the mound
after every pitch, left to right, before climbing back up to the
rubber from the left-field side, always careful to walk in the same
footprints. Jason Grimsley, the Yankees reliever, tugs at the same
spot on the bill of his cap before every pitch; underneath, the
stitching on the bill is worn. Mike Mussina, the Orioles' All-Star
pitcher, will pause briefly as he stands atop the rubber, staring
downward at the mound _ a moment to focus his thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   Nomar Garciaparra, Boston's shortstop, may have the longest set
of adjustments _ involving his batting gloves, his wrist bands, his
bat and, finally, his feet, lifting one and then the other as he
sets himself in the box. During Jeter's only at-bat in the All-Star
Game in Boston this year, he good-naturedly imitated some of
Garciaparra's movements, grinning and glancing over at the American
League dugout to be sure his actions were being noted.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes players aren't aware of their particular movements
until they see others imitating them. Before every pitch,
Minnesota's Terry Steinbach grabs the bill of his cap with his left
hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know it until it was called to my attention,''
Steinbach said. ``We had a guy who was good at mimicking other
players, and my reaction was, `I don't do that.' I looked at my cap
and it had pine tar on it. I don't do it before each at-bat; I do
it before every pitch. It's not orchestrated. It's just habit.''

<P>
   Knoblauch can't remember the origin of his routine, whether he
started in high school, in Houston, or when he was in college, at
Texas A&AMP;M. Tom Kelly, Minnesota's manager when Knoblauch broke into
the majors with the Twins, said the second baseman has had the same
approach all along.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch said: ``Two years ago I saw a videotape of when I was
hitting in the minor leagues, and I kind of did the same thing.
It's something I might've always done, or maybe it's progressed as
I've gone along.''
</P>
<P>
   The practice fits his grating professional personality as a
leadoff hitter. Knoblauch is, as Jeter called him affectionately, a
pest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pitchers probably get frustrated, but it's working if that's
the way they view it, like I'm trying to slow them down,''
Knoblauch said. ``It's like when you're a batter and you throw your
helmet: the pitcher knows he's got the best of you. If the
pitcher's thinking about me standing out of the box, then he's not
thinking about throwing his next pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Hall of Fame outfielder Frank Robinson was asked to
talk to players about ways to speed the pace of games, and Robinson
believed the Yankees consistently played some of the slowest games.
He nudged manager Joe Torre to ask his players to play faster, and
Robinson spoke to some players individually.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson approached Knoblauch, and before Robinson said
anything, Knoblauch asked, ``You're going to talk to me about
stepping out of the box?'' No, Robinson replied, he just wanted to
talk about hitting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe now, because I've been around for a while,'' Knoblauch
said, ``it's just kind of seen as part of what I do.''

 &HT;    Anniversary of the fall of Atlanta marked
 &HT;    By Will Anderson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ About 90 people gathered at the state Capitol Saturday
to commemorate the 135th anniversary of the fall of Atlanta and
garner support for preserving the state's Civil War battlefields.
</P>
<P>
   The event brought descendants of Civil War veterans _ Yankees
and Rebels alike _ from as far away as California to talk about
their ancestors' involvement in the war. Much of the information
was gleaned from history books, personal diaries, letters written
to loved ones and other obscure documents. A few of the attendees
had ancestors on both sides of the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   In late August 1864, Gen. William T. Sherman's troops had all
but surrounded Atlanta and his cannons were bombarding the city
every day. But the Union troops were having trouble breakihng
through because the Confederates were entrenched on the outskirts
of town behind earthen fortifications built largely by slave labor,
said Civil War historian William R. Scaife.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta troops' only supply line was the railroad that came
through Jonesboro to the south. When the Confederates were defeated
at Jonesboro on Aug. 31, it opened the door for the Union invasion
of to Atlanta, which fell the next day.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's reunion was organized by the Civil War Commission and
the private non-profit Georgia Battlefields Association. The two
groups are working jointly to preserve the state's Civil War
battlefields, such as Griswoldville near Macon, where one of the
few skirmishes took place during Sherman's march to the sea after
the burning of Atlanta. Griswoldville battle park was dedicated
last November.
</P>
<P>
   The organizations also want to buy a portion of the land where
the battle of Resaca took place between Atlanta and Chattanooga in
May 1864, but have run into difficulties with Scott Fletcher, the
owner of the 1,200-acre property, who bought the land in 1998
knowing the state wanted it preserved as a park.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers drew a parallel between Saturday's reunion and the
1911 Peace March of Atlanta, in which the Peace Monument was
unveiled in Peidmont Park. The monument, which still stands,
depicts an angel of peace tapping a Confederate soldier on the left
shoulder to announce the Civil War has ended, said Oliver J.
Keller, who serves on the Civil War Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The 1911 march brought together Civil War veterans from both the
North and South with the goal of healing the scars of war. With
that in mind, Keller said Saturday's reunion wasn't like other
Civil War gatherings in the South.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not out there waving battle flags,'' said Keller, a
Pennsylvania native. ``There was no firing of guns and no one
playing Dixie. We're all Americans North and South, and it's all
part of the American story.''
</P>

and Waltraut Neumann met at the end of World War II, close to 90
percent of Berlin's 1.5 million apartments had been damaged by
Allied bombing. Aged 18, penniless, they went to work as
``Truemmerfrauen'' -- two of the thousands of ``rubble women''
whose job it was to clear up the mess. That history is present in
the lives of Mrs. Mueller and Mrs. Neumann, who found themselves on
opposite sides of the Berlin wall when it went up in 1961, just as
it is alive in the hearts of many of this city's 3.5 million
people. In Berlin, unlike Bonn, the difficulty of making Germany

THE TOP TEN INVESTMENT SCAMS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By JOHN HIELSCHER   
 Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARASOTA, Fla. _ The time has never been better to make money in
the investment world _ and to get ripped off by scam artists.
</P>
<P>
   Securities fraud costs American consumers billions of dollars
every year, and industry regulators say technological advances and
investors' hunger for profits have generated a new wave of
investment cons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, we have an ideal climate for fraud,'' said Peter C.
Hildreth, president of the North American Administrators
Association, which represents state securities regulators.
</P>
<P>
   ``Millions of new investors, many of whom expect unrealistically
high returns, are looking for places to put their money. At the
same time, we're living through an Internet-driven technology
revolution that is a boon to investors and con artists alike,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   State and national securities regulators are the cops who are
supposed to protect investors. But they say their resources are
limited, and investors must take responsibility to protect
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``As always, investors are the first line of defense against
fraud,'' Hildreth said. ``The best weapons investors have to
protect themselves and their money are skepticism and common
sense.''
</P>
<P>
   The association recently named the ``Top Ten Investment Scams''
that target consumers these days. Here they are, in order of
seriousness or prevalence:
</P>
<P>
   _ Internet fraud. Con artists are using the World Wide Web to
``pump and dump'' small stocks, peddle bogus offshore ``prime
bank'' notes and run variations of the classic pyramid scheme.
Regulators suggest never investing based solely on an Internet tip;
do the research yourself.
</P>
<P>
   _ Investment seminars. Some expensive seminars promise people
the secret to getting rich quick. But often, it's the people
running the seminar that make the big money off admission fees and
selling books and audiotapes. Some new one-day seminars say they
can turn average investors into successful day traders. They forget
to tell you that most day traders lose their money within several
months.
</P>
<P>
   _ Affinity group fraud. Con artists like to target members of
closely knit religious, political or ethic groups. The crooks are,
or claim to be, part of the affiliation and take advantage of the
natural trust among similar people. The scammers often offer phony
employment or financial advice.
</P>
<P>
   _ Abusive sales practices. Some brokers specialize in aggressive
cold calling to promote low-priced securities. Regulators say they
are making progress by suspending and prosecuting those microcap
stock manipulators. Investors can just hang up the phone.
</P>
<P>
   _ Telemarketing fraud. Boiler rooms _ those high-pressure
telephone sales operations _ open up every day to sell illegal or
phony investments. The scammers often try to take advantage of the
news headlines, such as Y2K concerns or breakthroughs in computers
or biotechnology.
</P>
<P>
   _ Promissory notes. These investments are promoted as
high-yielding investments that are guaranteed by bonding companies.
Too often they are notes in companies that don't even exist.
Regulators say this is one of the fastest-growing frauds in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   _ Viatical investment scams. Viatical contracts are interests in
the death benefits of terminally ill patients, such as cancer or
AIDS victims. The insured gets a percentage of the death benefit to
help them during their last days, and investors get a share in the
death benefits, such as life insurance, after a fee is paid to the
viatical investment broker. Regulators say this is one the hottest
new investment products and one of the riskiest, for no other
reason than speculating on when an ill person may die.
</P>
<P>
   _ Entertainment fraud. Investors who hope to hit it big on the
next ``Titanic'' can be easy prey for scammers selling phony
interests in movies, cable TV shows, video games or other
entertainment products.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ponzi schemes. The classic swindle attracts investors with the
promise of high rates of return over a short period of time. The
earliest investors are paid with money from the most recent
investors, not from any actual earnings. The Ponzi scheme always
collapses, and the big winners are always the con artists.
</P>
<P>
   _ Illegal franchise offerings. Many people would like to own
their own businesses, but some crooks are selling phony franchises
or making inadequate disclosures about the risks and costs of such
businesses.

mile swim recently. Johnson, a second-term Republican,
unflinchingly admits he used marijuana and cocaine in college, and
he now wants the nation to consider alternatives to the war on
drugs. ``We are spending incredible amounts of our resources on
incarceration, law enforcement and courts,'' he says. ``As an

Platt's success in turning company policy around from the
traditional ``man rules the roost'' culture to a gender-blind ethos
holds an important lesson for the rest of corporate America: A
little direction at the top can go a long way. As for the future,
Platt is leaving it up to the company's employees to make sure
Hewlett-Packard does not revert to its old self. Specific programs

   (NYT10) UNDATED -- Aug. 21, 1999 -- GERMANY-REUNIFICATION, 8-21
-- Wally Mueller and Waltraut Neumann in 1945. When Wally Mueller
and Waltraut Neumann met at the end of World War II, close to 90
percent of Berlin's 1.5 million apartments had been damaged by
Allied bombing. Aged 18, penniless, they went to work as
``Truemmerfrauen'' -- two of the thousands of ``rubble women''
whose job it was to clear up the mess. That history is present in
the lives of Mrs. Mueller and Mrs. Neumann, who found themselves on
opposite sides of the Berlin wall when it went up in 1961, just as
it is alive in the hearts of many of this city's 3.5 million
people. In Berlin, unlike Bonn, the difficulty of making Germany
whole is palpable. (New York Times Photo)

SILICON-VALLEY-TRAFFIC-2, 8-21 -- For many professionals at dot-com
companies in Silicon Valley, the boom in the Internet has resulted
in a commuting bust, forcing them to funnel onto increasingly
congested highways that snake in and around the crowded Bay Area.
Scores of people in Oakland, like Francis Torrence, right, line up
daily to catch a ride to San Francisco. Passengers mill about until
drivers, whom they do not know but who want to save the $2 San
Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge toll and use the commuter lane, pick
them up. An unspoken etiquette has evolved among repeat carpoolers.

Cigarran, 24-year-old group manager of Beyond.com's entertainment
software division, with co-worker and commuting partner David
Hollister, drive an average of 2 1/2 hours every day to and from
work. For many, the daily Silicon Valley commute is likely to get
worse before it gets better, leaving some to wonder whether the
plugged-in driving lifestyle will end. ``It is a full-on
nightmare,'' says Ms. Cigarran. (Peter Dasilva/New York Times

STATES FAULTED FOR LAX LEAD-TESTING OF POOR YOUTH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (CORRECTS ages of children in 9th graf; SUBS 10th graf to clarify
statistics.) 
(ATTN: N.J., Conn., Wash., Calif., Mont., Ala., Colo.)  (js) 
 By ROBERT PEAR    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Federal investigators say most states are flouting
a 1989 law that requires young children on Medicaid to be tested
for lead poisoning. As a result, they say, hundreds of thousands of
children exposed to dangerously high levels of lead are neither
tested nor treated.
</P>
<P>
   The General Accounting Office, an investigative arm of Congress,
found that ``few Medicaid children are screened for blood-lead
levels,'' even though the problem of lead poisoning is concentrated
among low-income children on Medicaid. Medicaid recipients are
three times as likely as other children to have high amounts of
lead in the blood.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, a federal advisory panel said last week that
``current lead screening rates among children covered by Medicaid
are very poor, despite federal requirements.''
</P>
<P>
   Cost is not the main reason for the failure to test children,
health officials say. The laboratory test usually costs less than
$10.
</P>
<P>
   Officials cite more complex reasons for the low rates of
testing. Many doctors do not see lead exposure as a problem for
their patients and therefore do not believe tests are necessary, or
they are unaware of the federal requirements. In addition, many
poor children do not go to the doctor until they are sick, and most
children with high levels of lead in the blood display no obvious
symptoms at first.
</P>
<P>
   Under federal law, states are responsible for the screening of
children on Medicaid. They can provide such services directly or
they can arrange for the services to be provided by doctors,
clinics and health maintenance organizations.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has repeatedly emphasized that all government
policies should be evaluated for their effects on children. But the
accounting office found that most of the children served by
Medicaid and other federal health programs were not tested for
lead, as federal law and regulations say they should be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Federal lead-screening policies are often not followed'' by
state officials, and the Federal Health Care Financing
Administration, which supervises Medicaid, does not review state
compliance with these policies, the auditors said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says 890,000
children age 1 through 5 have so much lead in their blood that it
could harm their health or their ability to learn.
</P>
<P>
   About 535,000 of these children are enrolled in Medicaid, but
fewer than 20 percent of Medicaid recipients in that age group _
1.2 million of the 6.3 million recipients _ are ever tested, the
accounting office found.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a dismal record,'' said Sen. Robert G. Torricelli,
D-N.J., who recently introduced a bill to increase lead testing of
children.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The state auditor of California, Kurt R. Sjoberg, reached a
similar conclusion in a new report on the experience of that state,
which has far more Medicaid recipients than any other state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thousands of lead-poisoned children have been allowed to
suffer needlessly'' because California has not complied with the
federal requirement to test them for lead poisoning, Sjoberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Susan K. Cummins, chief of the state's lead poisoning
prevention program, said perhaps 20 percent of the children on
Medicaid in California had been tested for lead. ``And that's
probably an optimistic estimate,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Federal rules say that children on Medicaid must be tested for
lead poisoning at the age of 12 months and again at 24 months.
Medicaid recipients ages 3 to 6 must also be tested if they have
not previously been screened.
</P>
<P>
   Screening rates vary greatly from state to state. In Washington
state, federal auditors found that fewer than 1 percent of the
children on Medicaid had been tested for lead poisoning. Elsewhere,
they said, rates range from 3 percent in Montana to 10 percent in
Colorado, 40 percent in New Jersey and 46 percent in Alabama. Many
states, including Connecticut, said they did not have statewide
data on testing rates or the prevalence of lead poisoning.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   New York has a state law that requires day-care centers and
nursery schools to ask parents for evidence of screening. The New
York City Health Department reported that more than 40 percent of
children ages 1 to 5 had been tested.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the federal requirements, Thomas W. Bedell, the Medicaid
director in Washington state, said: ``We don't believe we have much
of a problem with lead exposure here. So we don't think it's
cost-effective to impose 100 percent screening. There are better
ways to spend our money.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Maxine D. Hayes, the acting health officer for Washington
state, added, ``We don't think it's right for the federal
government to dictate what states should do'' in testing children.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Under federal rules, Medicaid will pay for testing and treating
a child, but will not pay for testing of substances like water and
paint that are sent to a laboratory for analysis.
</P>
<P>
   Public health experts say this policy often cripples efforts to
identify the cause of a child's lead poisoning.
</P>
<P>
   The advisory panel that voiced concern about the low rates of
screening also said last week that Medicaid should pay for
laboratory tests of dust, water and other substances in the homes
of children poisoned by lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Such testing is good public health policy, and it's definitely
the standard of care for treating lead-poisoned kids,'' said Dr.
Cummins, the chairwoman of the panel, the Advisory Committee on
Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention, which expressed its views in a
letter to Donna E. Shalala, the secretary of health and human
services.
</P>
<P>
   Heather M. Mauro, a resident of Atco, N.J., said she felt
fortunate that her children had been tested for lead because the
tests detected high levels of lead in all four youngsters. But she
said: ``After six years, we are still trying to rebuild our home,
one room at a time, to remove the lead. It has cost us thousands
and thousands of dollars.'' The home, a large Victorian, was built
in the late 1800s or early 1900s.
</P>
<P>
   Lead poisoning can cause learning disabilities, behavior
problems and neurological damage in children, and Mrs. Mauro said
she believed that her children had suffered such problems because
of exposure to lead.
</P>
<P>
   Since lead has been removed from gasoline and food cans,
children are most likely to encounter it now in old paint and in
dust contaminated with such paint. More than 80 percent of homes
built before 1978 have lead-based paint in them.

   State officials across the country are encouraging families on
Medicaid to join health maintenance organizations. But Sara
Rosenbaum, a professor of health law and policy at George
Washington University, said that in their contracts with HMOs,
states rarely specified the full range of services that should be
provided to children with lead poisoning.
</P>
<P>
   In New Jersey, Edward J. Rogan, a spokesman for the Department
of Human Services, said ``we are not happy'' with the fact that
only 40 percent of children on Medicaid have been tested for lead
poisoning. ``We want to strengthen our contracts with HMOs to make
sure they achieve a greater level of screening,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut officials said they did not have statewide data on
lead testing of Medicaid recipients. In Hartford, where doctors and
hospitals have made special efforts to eliminate lead poisoning, a
recent study of 877 preschoolers found that 93 percent had been
tested. But Judith Solomon, executive director of the Children's
Health Council, a child advocacy group, said, ``We don't assume the
results would be the same in other parts of the state.''

JALEEL WHITE OUTGROWS URKEL PAST WITH NEW SITCOM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Midway through his nine-year reign as the suspender-snapping,
squeaky-voiced Urkel on the family sitcom ``Family Matters,''
Jaleel White came to a disconcerting-though-hardly-startling truth:
Those who invent strong characters are usually stuck with them.
</P>
<P>
   It was around this time White began to design Life After Urkel.
The plan: To prove that he could step outside an exaggerated
character whose oversized glasses, plaid shirts and denims hiked to
the hilt got all the laughs.
</P>
<P>
   While continuing to play the beloved nerd, White worked in a
number of supporting characters. Grandpa Urkel. Grandma Urkel.
Sister Urkel. You get the drift.
</P>
<P>
   One character he designed specifically for himself. The gimmick
behind Stefan Urquelle, an Urkel alter-ego who emerged after a trip
to a ``transformation chamber,'' was no gimmick. Urquelle was
suave, handsome and wore pleated pants and fitted sport coats. He
was everything Urkel was not, exactly the image White wanted to
cultivate.
</P>
<P>
   There are similarities, but Stefan Urquelle isn't the character
who fronts ``Grown Ups,'' White's new comedy series premiering at
7:30 p.m. CDT Monday on UPN. (The sitcom is the first of more than
40 new programs that will roll out between now and October. Just a
warning.)
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the character is a variation on White himself, not to
mention something of a TV anomaly: Here's an established sitcom
star who is practically starting from scratch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grown Ups'' centers on White's J. Calvin Frazier, or ``J,''
and his quick-witted childhood buddy Gordon (Dave Ruby), who looks
like he'll be the target of fat-boy humor in regards to his girth
and his girl. He's married to a cute blonde (Marissa Ribisi) who
outside a TV stage set probably wouldn't share lunch with him, let
alone a pillow.
</P>
<P>
   The series targets that uncertain period shortly after college
and shortly before family commitments consume you. As J explains to
Buddy while shooting hoops in Monday night's pilot: ``That job I
used to have? It's now my career. That girl you used to date? She's
now your wife. Say goodbye to childhood.''
</P>
<P>
   I should mention that this serious moment comes right before
their basketball goes sailing through a car window and off they run
in the opposite direction. So much for adult responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   Old fans will be surprised by White. He's tall, angular, quite
muscular and even relatively credible as a well-dressed
professional with a serious sexual swagger. His portrayal of J is
actually written to be complicated; he seems conceited in one scene
and thoughtful and selfless in the next. As White mentioned in an
interview, ``Isn't that what real life is like? Not only are people
in that time of their lives not perfect, but they often change
stripes depending on the person they're dealing with and what they
need from them.''
</P>
<P>
   That makes sense, but I don't know how much of that comes
through in the pilot. Nor is it clear whether the series, produced
by Al Haymon (''Between Brothers'') and Jonathan Prince, (the
terrible ``Ask Harriet''), will be allowed to explore such issues
without making them appear silly.
</P>
<P>
   What ``Grown Ups'' has going for it is a surprisingly restrained
pace and rhythm, and a tendency to stay away from the traditional
sitcom fodder that characterized White's years on ``Family
Matters.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps we shouldn't be so surprised by the richness seeping out
of the scenes involving White and Gabrielle Union, a former
schoolmate. For a moment or two, ``Grown Ups'' actually steered
clear of the yuk-every-other-line formula. It made me double-check:
Is this UPN?

   In 1993 the San Francisco Giants won 103 games and didn't make

baseball the next time they had playoffs.

mathematical impossibility: Four into three won't go. The Mets,
Atlanta, Houston and Cincinnati are competing for three playoff
spots. One of them won't make it, even though they all could have
better records than the Arizona Diamondbacks, the presumptive
winner of the NL West.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's something you have to live with all winter,'' said
Brian Cashman, the Yankees' general manager, just an observer in
this instance.
</P>
<P>
   But could wild-card expansion, a la the National Football
League, be far behind?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if that's realistic,'' Gerry Hunsicker, the
Houston general manager, said.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't, said Jim Bowden, the Cincinnati general manager. ``I
think we have it right,'' he added. ``Four teams in a league is
just right. I don't like the diluted system like the NHL has.
That's what makes races so great. It'll be a lot of fun. All four
teams have six weeks to prove they're better than the other one.''
</P>
<P>
   The wild card, Bowden said, ``creates such exciting scoreboard
watching; you're not just watching your own division, you're
watching others because of the wild card.''
</P>
<P>
   The need to peruse the scoreboard will be reduced to one game
for each of the four teams this week. In one of those delightfully
great confluences of the schedule, the Mets will play the Astros
while the Braves play the Reds Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday. If
only this were the final weekend of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is fun,'' Bowden said. ``You're on pins and needles every
inning.''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, if every team in the division races were assured of a
playoff spot, the races would command less interest. The idea of a
race is for someone to win and for someone to lose.
</P>
<P>
   The introduction of the wild card to baseball diluted the races
and the significance of a division championship. If the Mets and
the Braves were competing for the NL East title but knew the loser
would be the wild card, the suspense would be sucked out of
September.
</P>
<P>
   It took only until the third year of the expanded playoffs for a
team that didn't finish first to become the World Series champion.
The Florida Marlins, of course, instantly self-destructed, but
that's another story. The idea of a second-place team being the
major leagues' champion is insulting to nearly a century of
first-place teams that were champions.
</P>
<P>
   That is not to say the wild-card concept has not created
interest in its own right. In this instance, it makes the four-team
race more intriguing because only one team instead of two teams
will miss the October fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think our division will be decided until the last
week,'' Steve Phillips, the Mets' general manager, said. ``We play
the Braves six of the last 12 games. I figure our division will
come down to that, and it's pretty clear that neither Cincinnati or
Houston is going away. I expect both will keep themselves within
striking distance.''
</P>
<P>
   With the races so close, it is not inconceivable that the
regular-season schedule could end with one or more ties. Last
season, the Chicago Cubs and the San Francisco Giants wound up in a
tie for the NL wild-card spot, and the Cubs snatched it in a
one-game playoff.
</P>
<P>
   Consider some of the possibilities for ties this season. The
Reds and the Astros could tie for first place in the Central,
finishing with the same record as the second-place Mets. In that
event, the Mets would automatically be the wild-card team because
the loser of the playoff game between the Reds and the Astros for
the Central championship would have one more loss than the Mets.
Results of that kind of playoff count in the regular-season
standings.
</P>
<P>
   What if all four teams were to finish with the same record, not
very likely but not an impossible development? The teams tied for
first would play each other for the championships of their
respective divisions; then the losers of those games, because they
would still have the same record, would play for the wild-card
designation. Loser goes home.
</P>
<P>
   ``In April,'' Hunsicker said, ``we talk about it being a
marathon. But now it comes down to a 40-game sprint.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets were not good sprinters last season. They wore down
with the finishing line in sight, losing their last five games.
This time around they appear to be built for the long haul, and it
is Atlanta and Houston that could falter. Both have injury problems
that they have to overcome to survive the next six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   This week's series between the Mets and the Astros, and the
Braves and the Reds, won't determine the outcome of the races. But
they will serve as a nice prelude to October.

SCHILLING OUT FOR SEASON?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Curt Schilling is eligible to come off the
disabled list Monday, but it is not out of the question he could be
finished for the season, especially after the Philadelphia Phillies
dropped nine of 12 to fall out of the wild-card race.
</P>
<P>
   There are several theories why Schilling broke down when the
Phillies needed him most, but overwork tops the list. During the
past four seasons, Schilling, who had major shoulder surgery in
1995, has thrown 38 complete games, including five straight in May.
That is 14 more than anyone else in baseball. (Randy Johnson is
next with 24).
</P>
<P>
   During the past three years, he has thrown 10,722 pitches. No
other pitcher is within 500 pitches of that total.
</P>
<P>
   When he recorded back-to-back 300-strikeout seasons in 1997 and
1998, Schilling pitched 523 innings. No one else pitched 500.
</P>
<P>
   Still working: Colorado Rockies GM Bob Gebhard still has his job
after published reports said he would be fired last Monday. But
it's only a matter of time. The strange thing was the story came
out Monday in the Denver Post when former Rockies manager Don
Baylor was in town as batting coach with Atlanta. Baylor was fired
last fall after owner Jerry McMorris had to decide between the
manager and the GM. Gebhard stayed, but will be gone after the
season. ``He called the shots,'' Baylor said. ``I've taken my
fall.'' Baylor is expected to surface next season in either Anaheim
or Baltimore. And it comes at a time when baseball is under fire
for not hiring more minorities. Only two of 11 minority managers
hired ever got a second chance. ``If that's racist, I don't know,''
Baylor said. ``The hiring practices haven't been very good
lately.''
</P>
<P>
   Going out on top: Left-hander Brian Anderson, who Arizona was
ready to trade this spring, was 5-1, 5.02 in 15 starts while taking
Todd Stottlemyre's spot in the rotation. Tuesday, Anderson pitched
his second career shutout, a 4-0 three-hitter against the Cubs, in
what likely will be his last start of the season. He will be used
in long relief as the D'backs stay with 12 pitchers and will step
in if any trouble develops with Stottlemyre, who returned Friday.
``All I could do was pitch today,'' Anderson said after the
victory. ``Everybody knew this was my last start. I can do the
math. I just wanted to go out and give it my best effort.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Clutch: Javy Lopez's season-ending knee surgery has robbed
Atlanta's lineup of one of the club's best clutch hitters. Lopez's
absence has been felt most in the late innings with the game on the
line. The Braves' .262 average with runners in scoring position is
only 11th-best in the league. With men in scoring position and two
outs, their average is .234, ranking them 15th among 16 teams.
Lopez's average was .296 with runners in scoring position and an
astounding .333 with runners in scoring position and two outs. His
replacement, Eddie Perez, is hitting .184 with runners in scoring
position and .091 with runners in scoring position and two outs.
</P>
<P>
   Muscle man: A year ago at this time, Dale Sveum was warming up
the pitchers in the bullpen for the New York Yankees, having been
released by the team a few weeks earlier. Wednesday, the
35-year-old utility player batted cleanup and started at first base
for Pittsburgh. Sveum not only hit his first two homers of the
season, he became the second player in franchise history to homer
from each side of the plate in the same game. The only other
Pirates player to do it is Bobby Bonilla, who did it twice. Sveum,
who played for the Pirates in 1996-97, signed a minor-league
contract with the team in May. He was called up July 24 but entered
the game batting just .172.

DAUBACH A ROY HOBBS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A former replacement player who had never played
in the majors before Boston signed him last winter, 27-year-old
Brian Daubach has suddenly become the talk of the town. His
$230,000 salary is roughly 1/60th of Mo Vaughn's $13.3 million
average salary with the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   His three-run ninth-inning double Wednesday gave the Red Sox a
huge 6-5 over Oakland, one of their rivals for the wild-card spot.
Vaughn, their former first baseman, hasn't played in a meaningful
game since opening day. Daubach also has 19 homers and 68 RBI,
numbers comparable to Vaughn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think (the fans) appreciate where he's come from, and maybe
they can associate with the work ethic and the time it's taken to
get the opportunity,'' Boston manager Jimy Williams said this past
week. ``And then to be successful like that, maybe a lot of them
feel that it's them in that uniform with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Welcome back Baerga: How badly did Carlos Baerga want to return
to Cleveland? He waived a clause that would have jacked his salary
from $500,000 to $1.5 million if he was traded from San Diego.
Baerga played with the Indians from 1990 to 1996. They traded him
because he'd lost his power and had burned himself out on the
baseball nightlife. Now he's back because the Indians need somebody
to play third base. Travis Fryman (right knee) and Wil Cordero
(left wrist) are still on the DL and not expected back until
mid-September. Enrique Wilson has played well defensively at third,
but had a recent 0-for-26 slump. Baerga started at third Monday and
went 2 for 4. Tuesday, he hit a two-run homer. Each time the fans
gave him a huge standing ovation.
</P>
<P>
   Not true for Belle: The same could not be said for wayward son
Albert Belle, who went 4 for 20 this season at Jacobs Field while
his new team, Baltimore, went 0-6. Last Sunday, Belle took a wild
swing in the fourth inning and his bat went sailing into the
stands. Belle stalked over to the railing and demanded it back as
the crowd booed. One reason Belle may have demanded the bat back:
Before he got caught corking his bat in 1994, Belle often went
after his broken bats that sailed into the stands. ``Albert doesn't
want to give anything to Cleveland,'' Indians reliever Paul Shuey
said. ``I'm surprised he doesn't go up in the stands after his foul
balls here.''
</P>
<P>
   Viva Orosco: It has been 12 years since relief pitcher Jesse
Orosco put lampblack in Kirk Gibson's hat before a spring training
game, a prank that helped focus the Dodgers and touch off their
miraculous run to a World Series title. Tuesday night in Baltimore,
Orosco came out of the bullpen for the 1,072nd time in his career,
making him baseball's all-time leader in total pitching
appearances. He passed Dennis Eckersley and likely set a record
that should go unchallenged for quite awhile. Orosco threw just two
pitches, retiring Twins second baseman Todd Walker on a deep fly
ball to center on his way into the record book.
</P>
<P>
   Josh update: Outfielder Josh Hamilton, the No. 1 overall pick in
this year's June Draft by Tampa Bay, has been promoted from Rookie
League Princeton to short-season Single-A Hudson Valley in the New
York-Penn League. Hamilton hit .347 for Princeton with 49 runs, 20
doubles, four triples, 10 home runs and 18 stolen bases. The news
isn't so promising on the No. 2 pick, Florida's Josh Beckett, who
says he is prepared to go to junior college after a contract
stalemate with the Marlins. Beckett began by asking for $8 million,
and the Marlins offered a bonus similar to the $3.95 million that
the Devil Rays gave Hamilton. If Beckett goes to school, the
Marlins won't be able to negotiate with him again until the season
ends in the spring. That would give the club about a week before
next year's draft.

SILVERBULLETDAY CONFIRMS HER CREDENTIALS  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOSEPH DURSO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. _ In a smashing performance on a track
that often foils the greatest horses, Silverbulletday won the 119th
running of the Alabama Stakes by nine lengths Saturday and
confirmed her rank as the prima donna among 3-year-old fillies in
thoroughbred racing.
</P>
<P>
   The bay filly from California won her seventh race in eight
starts this year and the 13th in 15 starts in her career, and
erased the doubts about distance that were raised when she finished
seventh in the Belmont Stakes two months ago. She overcame a slow
pace in the Alabama, proved that she could win at a mile and a
quarter and showed that she might even become a candidate for Horse
of the Year if she can exert her talents against colts in the
second half of the racing season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Awesome, that's the word that says it best,'' the jockey Jerry
Bailey said. ``She surprised even me today, she's that good.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was a little wide going into the first turn, and we had to
run down a slow pace. But she was always within five lengths of the
lead, and I knew that I had a lot of horse. I was confident she
would blow by the leader and hold off any challengers. When I rode
her in the Belmont, the race just wasn't her style. But I would be
comfortable riding her against colts again.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Baffert, the California trainer who lost Real Quiet earlier
this week to a leg injury, indicated that he would continue to run
his prize filly against other fillies for now, at least. Meanwhile,
having been thwarted in the Belmont Stakes the last two years with
a Triple Crown on the line, he crossed a personal barrier by
finally winning a Grade I stakes in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Jerry,'' he said, ```If you take this filly back and
let her lope around, you'll have so much horse, she'll outsprint
them.' When she came back, she wasn't tired at all. We were going
to run her in the Haskell, but things didn't work out. She proved
that I could win a GradeI race in New York. With Real Quiet being
out, you have to enjoy the moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Silverbulletday gave her performance in a light drizzle in the
premiere event for fillies at Saratoga Race Course, and she did it
with style and command. Bailey had her placed fifth after half a
mile, third after three-quarters, second after one mile, and he
never showed her the whip as she caught Strolling Belle at the head
of the homestretch and flew past.
</P>
<P>
   At the wire, they were strung out all over the track behind her:
nine lengths back to Strolling Belle, three more to Gandria and 6{
lengths to the filly On A Soapbox, who won the Coaching Club
American Oaks last month at a mile and a half.
</P>
<P>
   Silverbulletday ran the mile and one-quarter in 2:02 3/5,
returned $2.80 for a $2 bet to win and banked $240,000, raising her
career earnings to $2.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a gift from heaven,'' said Mike Pegram, who owns the
superstar. ``A once-in-a-lifetime horse. But at this point, the
Breeders' Cup Classic is not a possibility in my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   And Mike Smith, who set the slow pace aboard Strolling Belle,
said: ``I had the pace I wanted, and more. Everything went our way.
But the real Silverbulletday showed up.''
</P>
<P>
   FINISH LINES
</P>
<P>
   The field did not include Dreams Gallore, who won the Mother
Goose at Belmont Park and ran second in the Coaching Club American
Oaks. ``The Coaching Club took a lot out of her,'' said her
trainer, Steve Asmussen. ``Right now, she's walking the shed row at
Churchill Downs, and I'm uncertain when she'll race again.'' ...
Backstage at Saratoga, the candidates were hustling for the peak
race of the season, next Saturday's $1 million Travers at a mile
and a quarter. Elliott Walden worked both his stars, Menifee,
winner of the Haskell, and Ecton Park, who won the Jim Dandy on the
same day, Aug. 8. Menifee breezed five furlongs in 1:00 3/5 and
galloped out six furlongs in 1:14 1/5. Ecton Park went five in 1:01
and galloped out six in 1:14 3/4. Walden, pleased with both
workouts, said, ``We have a shot in the Travers with both horses.''
... Lemon Drop Kid, who won the Belmont, breezed five furlongs in
1:00 2/5. It was his second workout since he ran second in the Jim
Dandy. And Badger Gold, third in the Jim Dandy, worked six furlongs
in 1:13 in his final tuneup for the Travers.

   PALMDALE: called the report encouraging.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reality is catching up with them,'' she said. ``In the 30
years they've owned the land, they've never really examined what
they could do with it, before this.''
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles County Supervisor Michael D. Antonovich, whose
district includes the Antelope Valley, said the report underscores
the need to develop Palmdale as a regional airport. He said if the
city declines to do so, it should sell its property to county
agencies willing to push ahead.
</P>
<P>
   He also criticized the Hagler Bailly report for failing to
highlight problems anticipated with the LAX expansion.
</P>
<P>
   ``At LAX there is limited space, congested freeways, pollution.
This study indicates a regional approach toward Antelope Valley and
Ontario is needed.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hagler Bailly consultants were hired after a two-day summit
of aviation experts last summer in Palmdale. The 69-page report
considers passenger projections, possible funding sources for the
airports, potential cargo and maintenance development, as well as a
review of existing environmental studies.
</P>
<P>
   It has been submitted to LAWA officials for their review and
final adoption.
</P>
<P>
   John Agoglia, president of the Board of Airport Commissioners,
said the report will be an integral part of LAWA's planning but
that it is not the ``Magna Carta.'' He said other studies will be
considered, too.
</P>
<P>
   Airports interim executive director Lydia Kennard estimated it
will be ``several months'' before a final recommendation is made on
Palmdale's future.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very, very positive about our commitment to the region,
but we need to review the study in a lot more steps before we
formalize our commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   She declined to discuss whether Palmdale will be included in the
LAX master plan, which already has cost the airport more than $30
million.
</P>
<P>
   Galanter said LAWA needs to press forward with an investment
strategy for Palmdale, as well as with a plan for enlisting the
airlines' cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope this turns into a real partnership,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The study strikes several cautionary notes, including the caveat
that it is not a precise marketing survey. Rather it is an effort
to estimate the ``optimum potential'' for the airport, which means
actual passenger demand may be less, the consultants said.
</P>
<P>
   It also rules out as impractical constructing an international
airport on the 17,700 acres of land the city of Los Angeles bought
with that in mind in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   The consultants said most international airports are within 20
miles of urban cores, with the exception being Washington Dulles
International. Dulles, which is about 25 miles from the central
business district, ``benefits from a policy decision to direct
international traffic away from Washington Reagan National to
Dulles.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmdale is about 55 miles from downtown L.A, but by 2020 at
least 1.5 million people will live closer to Palmdale Airport than
any other, the study says. Ledford said transportation improvements
to San Bernardino could boost that number to 2.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   The study estimates a maximum of up to 100 departures per day
from Palmdale.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles owns the terminal and jointly operates a landing
field with the U.S. Air Force. Ledford said there's an agreement
with the military barring expansion onto the city's property before
the airport reaches 400 flights per day.
</P>
<P>
   The report additionally underscores the airlines' longstanding
market concerns with Palmdale. Several carriers have offered
commuter service there without success.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Transport Association, which represents 23 national and
five non-U.S. airlines, has yet to take an official position on
Palmdale's revitalization as a regional airport, said Kris
Fitzgerald, director of government affairs in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd like to see the new report and to share it with our
colleagues and carriers. It will be nice to have something a little
more formal to review.'
</P>
<P>
   Southwest Airlines officials are among those who have examined
the Antelope Valley market and remain unconvinced it can support
aviation service in the short term, said Leslie Carr, the airlines'
manager of properties.
</P>
<P>
   ``The report is good news in that it suggests a future market in
Palmdale, but it probably doesn't have any immediate implications
for Southwest Airlines.''
</P>
<P>
   The consultants said that a subsidy might be required initially
to attract airport users.
</P>
<P>
   But the report concludes that despite the risks inherent in such
a venture, financing should be available to get the airport going.
</P>
<P>
   ``Palmdale is certainly not the first airport to face such a
start-up problem,'' it states. ``A variety of tried and true
sources of funding exist.''
</P>
<P>
   end!

STUDY FINDS PALMDALE AIRPORT COULD EASE LAX CRUSH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY BETH BARRETT  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALMDALE -- Palmdale Airport _ ignored for decades by Los
Angeles officials and abandoned by airlines _ could serve millions
of passengers within a decade with planning, leadership and
investment, an L.A. World Airports report says.
</P>
<P>
   A copy of the confidential draft report obtained by the Daily
News outlines for the first time Palmdale's potential as a regional
hub serving fast-growing northern L.A. County and western San
Bernardino County.
</P>
<P>
   Commissioned by officials in charge of Los Angeles International
Airport who also oversee the Palmdale terminal and the vast acreage
around it, the study concludes that the facility could serve up to
4 million passengers annually within a decade and 7.3 million
passengers a year by 2020.
</P>
<P>
   There is no commercial airline service now operating at
Palmdale. Development of the airport has been raised as a key issue
by opponents of LAX expansion.
</P>
<P>
   The $231,000 report by Hagler Bailly Services Inc. of Arlington,
Va., assumed rapid population growth in the area, improved airport
highway access and a willingness by airlines to provide service.
</P>
<P>
   Palmdale would require about $240 million in terminal and
airfield improvements on top of hundreds of millions in
transportation corridor improvements if the traffic benchmarks are
to be reached, the study adds.
</P>
<P>
   Informed of the contents of the report, city officials in
Palmdale as well as a broad range of opponents of the proposed
massive expansion of LAX lauded the possibility of increased
airline service in north L.A. County, which would drain some demand
from LAX.
</P>
<P>
   ``We concur with this study 100 percent,'' said El Segundo's
Mayor Mike Gordon, who heads a coalition of 65 cities and
transportation agencies pushing for a regional solution.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have always felt that Palmdale's role was to serve as a
regional hub airport for the northern part of the county, which is
experiencing tremendous growth. This just bears out that Palmdale
could be developed in line with what Burbank Airport is today, if
you provide market incentives so that people won't drive past
Palmdale to get (cheaper) tickets at LAX.''
</P>
<P>
   The report concludes that Palmdale Airport could handle up to 7
percent of the region's passenger demand within a couple of
decades, under the best scenario.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be very significant in lessening the burden on
LAX,'' Gordon said.
</P>
<P>
   Hagler Bailly Services' consultants did not return calls for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Palmdale Mayor James Ledford said the study ``absolutely
validates what we've been saying all along.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The beauty of the whole situation is that we have the best
land-use airport around in terms of well-defined noise corridors,
which should mean we won't repeat the situations that have been
encountered at Burbank, Van Nuys and even Ontario airports,''
Ledford said.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two years amid mounting political pressure, Palmdale
has moved from a blip on the region's aviation radar to a
legitimate player. In 1998, for instance, the Southern California
Association of Governments estimated no more than 200,000
passengers would be using Palmdale by 2020.
</P>
<P>
   SCAG executive director Mark Pisano said those numbers are now
being re-evaluated by the organization's aviation subcommittee and
that there now is consensus Palmdale ``could be larger.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It depends on how many steps the public and private sector
take to increase the capacity,'' he said. ``The airport could
increase several-fold beyond the 200,000 number.''
</P>
<P>
   Ledford added that Palmdale and LAWA have been cooperating and
are in final negotiations over a ``memorandum of understanding''
that would formally spell out some of the planned transportation
improvements near the airport.
</P>
<P>
   The consultants estimated that demand for the airport could be
boosted by as much as 10 percent if approximately $550 million is
spent on dedicated airport lanes along Highway 14 from Santa
Clarita and on improving Highway 138, the highway linking Palmdale
and Interstate 15 in San Bernardino.
</P>
<P>
   Ledford said Palmdale still hopes for formal consideration in
LAWA's master plan, which to date has focused on the proposal to
expand LAX from an airport serving about 60 million passengers a
year to one capable of handling 92 million. It is being backed by
Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan, the airlines and downtown
business interests.
</P>
<P>
   Ledford said increasingly both ``opponents and proponents'' of
the LAX expansion are joining to urge that Palmdale be developed as
the region's next major airport.
</P>
<P>
   City Councilwoman Ruth Galanter, who represents many of the
neighborhoods around LAX that fear further degradation of their
communities if the expansion is approved, called the report
encouraging.

WINNING CARRIES MORE WEIGHT THAN LONG BALL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It is hard to imagine Mark McGwire could hit more
than 60 home runs in back-to-back seasons, even harder to believe
he will not be named National League Most Valuable Player either
year.
</P>
<P>
   But winning drives award voting and that was never clearer than
last year when Sammy Sosa was named MVP more for leading the
Chicago Cubs into the playoffs than just his 66 homers.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa, like McGwire, will hit 60 again this year, but both are
playing for losing teams. The difference in 1999 was never clearer
than last weekend in St. Louis. After McGwire was retired in the
seventh inning of a close game fans raced to the exits.
</P>
<P>
   Can you imagine fans leaving in the seventh inning? It was
because the big boppers were done for the day, even if the game was
on the line.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways 1999 might be even more important to baseball than
last season's run at Roger Maris. There are two riveting division
races in the National League and an intriguing three-way struggle
for the wild-card spot in the American League.
</P>
<P>
   Now, you might like the wild card as much as the designated
hitter and interleague play. You might say there is no way to
capture the Sosa/McGwire magic in a series between the Toronto Blue
Jays and Oakland Athletics.
</P>
<P>
   But baseball likes what it sees. Some of the teams involved in
the wild-card chase are of the small-market variety, the have-nots
that were not supposed to have any chance against the Dodgers and
New York Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   True, the NL East race is between the filthy-rich Atlanta Braves
and New York Mets. But in the Central, Cincinnati and Houston have
tight budgets. In the AL, Oakland has no budget and fewer fans. But
with a new ballpark going up in San Francisco and the sale of the
A's expected this winter, Oakland's success could not have come at
a better time.
</P>
<P>
   With Montreal on the verge of leaving if it can't get a downtown
ballpark, Toronto's poor showing the past few years left Canada as
baseball's bush leagues. But young stars Shawn Green and Carlos
Delgado and reliever Billy Koch make this a team worth watching.
</P>
<P>
   There is no mega team this season. Not even the Yankees are the
Yankees from a year ago. Each has flaws, some more important than
others.
</P>
<P>
   _A 17-for-83 (.205) skid since July 24 has dropped the Reds'
Sean Casey's average from a league-leading .374 to a season-low
.341.
</P>
<P>
   _The Astros have been beating up on teams with losing records
but since June 14, they are 3-16 against Atlanta, Cincinnati and
Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   _The A's wild-card chances took a big hit after fiery Tony
Phillips suffered a season-ending broken left leg. Oakland
responded by beating Pedro Martinez on Thursday to earn a split
with the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   As for MVP, remember Ted Williams hit .406 in 1941 and captured
the Triple Crown in 1947, but did not win either year. This season,
the winners should be Texas catcher Pudge Rodriguez and the Mets'
Robin Ventura. Both are having career years on the field and in the
clubhouse. The Rangers are considered the lightweights of the AL
elite, almost certain to lose in the first round to either
Cleveland or the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   But Rodriguez has done some remarkable things during one of the
hottest summers in Texas memory. He is the first catcher to record
20 homers and 20 stolen bases. He is throwing out a staggering 60
percent of baserunners. He has guided a weak starting staff and
helped nurture a strong bullpen that could give playoff teams fits
in the late innings of low-scoring games.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez could lose some votes to teammate Rafael Palmeiro.
Ventura could lose some to Houston's Jeff Bagwell because Mets
second baseman Edgardo Alfonso also is closing in on 100 RBI. Mike
Piazza, who is having a Mike Piazza year for the Mets, might
further split the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Sosa and McGwire, all of them play for winners.

IN A PINCH, HANSEN IS THE MAN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Get up, go surfing.
</P>
<P>
   Go to the ballpark, play baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Come home, play the guitar.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like the life of a typical Southern California kid in the
summer. Only, we're talking about a 30-year-old kid.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Hansen doesn't understand why it has to be any different.
It was fun to do all those things growing up in Long Beach and
later in Rowland Heights, where he graduated from Rowland High in
1986.
</P>
<P>
   Just because he's in the big leagues now, with a wife and two
daughters, Hansen sees no reason why he can't continue to enjoy
those things.
</P>
<P>
   Hansen, though, respects his job with the Los Angeles Dodgers
enough that he'll stay off the surfboard during the baseball
season. When the season winds down, surf's up.
</P>
<P>
   As for the guitar, it's been in his hands as much as a baseball
bat for most of his life. And if he can handle the guitar like he
handles the bat, it's safe to assume he can pick it pretty good.
</P>
<P>
   Hansen has become one of the best pinch-hitters in baseball.
He's more than halfway to Dodgers coach Manny Mota's record for
career pinch hits (150). Hansen has 85, including 12 this season.
He set the Dodgers' single-season record of 18 in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   As a pinch-hitter, Hansen has a career batting average of .288
with six home runs and 43 RBI. Pinch-hitting is regarded as one of
the most difficult tasks in the game because players often sit for
several innings, then enter with the game on the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more of a mental game than physical,'' said Hansen, who
is hitting .275 this season with two homers and 13 RBI. ``Guys that
are in the flow of the game early have a tough time (pinch-hitting)
because it's usually done late. I try early to get into the flow
mentally, but not physically.
</P>
<P>
   ``Adrenaline is a big part of it. You have to harness your
adrenaline. When you're up there, you have to block out the
situation because, usually, it's a tight game. That's when you turn
into a Little Leaguer _ see the ball, hit the ball. You try to make
it simple.''
</P>
<P>
   Hansen credits his teachers _ former teammates Mickey Hatcher,
Chris Gwynn and Mitch Webster _ for helping him become a good
pinch-hitter. And, of course, ``Manny's still around. We still talk
about it. I'm lucky that way.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's patient at the plate; he's selective and he knows the
strike zone,'' Mota said of Hansen. ``He doesn't try to kill the
ball; he makes good contact and puts the ball in play. He's very
disciplined and very professional. And he knows every pitcher in
the book.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his success, Hansen still wants to be an everyday
player. He's had his share of starts _ 98 at third base in 1992 _
but finds himself in a peculiar situation.
</P>
<P>
   Since a quality pinch-hitter is so difficult to find, he
actually hurts his chances of being a regular player by being
successful off the bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's true, but I'm not going to do bad to try to get into
the starting lineup,'' Hansen said. ``I accept my role on the
ballclub and I enjoy it. But I do hope to be an everyday player one
day. That keeps me going.''
</P>
<P>
   Either way, Hansen always has his guitar.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a rock star; I'm a baseball player. I don't confuse
the two,'' Hansen said. ``But for me, it's something I've always
had. It runs in my family. My father (Guy) plays, and my uncle
played drums. I played in my share of groups in high school. And my
cousin is doing it professionally now with his band.''
</P>
<P>
   Hansen has a guitar in a back room near the Dodgers' clubhouse.
Every now and then, he'll round up a few other players who play
music and they'll jam.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, Hansen often would play with Mike Piazza, who
plays the drums.
</P>
<P>
   Now in his second tour with the Dodgers _ he left after the 1996
season, played one season with the Cubs in '97 and in Japan in '98
_ Hansen appreciates being so close to the ones and things he
loves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoy being home,'' he said.``You appreciate it more when
you play somewhere else and come home. And you realize why you like
Southern California so much.''

   LOS ANGELES: 1998 level.
</P>
<P>
   This kind of across-the-board strength is helping David Ellis,
owner of David Ellis Chrysler-Plymouth Inc. in the Canoga Park
community of Los Angeles' San Fernando Valley, enjoy the last year
of the millennium. Sales at his midsize store are up 20 percent on
an annual basis.
</P>
<P>
   He attributes the jump to the strong economy and product churn
as customers turn over leased vehicles. The trend is to keep a car
for three years rather than five or six years.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a shorter cycle of how long people are keeping their
automobiles, and that helps sales,'' Ellis said.
</P>
<P>
   About 50 percent of his business is leasing. A leased vehicle
counts as being sold on the balance sheet.
</P>
<P>
   Jon Ashton, senior research director at the Dohring Co., a
Glendale-based automotive market research firm, said that to be
successful dealers have to focus on service as well as price.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers will be more information-savvy and price-savvy, and
the dealer is going to be concentrating on more than just price,''
Ashton said. ``The greatest dynamic right now is how to best use
the Internet as a new source of awareness for customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellis concurs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're paying more attention to the customer satisfaction index
_ more so than ever. Midsize dealers like ourselves really have to
take care of the customer and keep them so they don't venture off
and buy cars online because they perceive it to be less cumbersome
and less of a hassle.''
</P>
<P>
   While there are challenges ahead, there is also good news.
</P>
<P>
   Industry forecasters see the buying boom extending into the next
century.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, it would take a real monkey wrench in the spokes to
derail this economy,'' Ford's Pipas said. ``It could happen, but I
think most economists place a very low probability on that
happening for the foreseeable future.''

NEW CAR SALES ARE ZOOMING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY GREGORY WILCOX  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Peace of mind drove Alex Salazar to buy a new
1999 Dodge Intrepid.
</P>
<P>
   With 138,000 miles on his 1990 car, it had begun to show a
little gray around the manifold.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed a car we could have more confidence in. And we
didn't have a lot of confidence in the old car,'' said Salazar, a
resident of the Winnetka community of Los Angeles' San Fernando
Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the fact that the $19,400 purchase coincided with
Mother's Day didn't hurt either. ``I love it; that was my Mother's
Day present,'' his wife, Maria, said of the burgundy four-door
sedan.
</P>
<P>
   This year, consumers like the Salazars are the rule rather than
the exception, much to the delight of automakers and dealers.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts and industry executives say that the stampede through
showrooms this year will likely push sales of cars and light trucks
to record levels. During the first half of this year, dealers
nationwide sold 8.5 million units, and little drop-off, if any, is
expected during the remaining six months.
</P>
<P>
   That means the total should top 16.5 million units by the time
the last deal is closed on Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   That would eclipse the record of 16.03 million cars and light
trucks sold in 1986, says a forecast from National Automobile
Dealers Association.
</P>
<P>
   Credit the booming market to a strong economy, low interest
rates and consumers brimming with the kind of confidence that comes
from increased purchasing power. Wealth being amassed in the stock
market is contributing, too.
</P>
<P>
   Tweak the numbers enough, and buying a new car starts to look
like a good deal.
</P>
<P>
   For example, for almost three years, new vehicle prices have
remained relatively flat while personal income has grown.
</P>
<P>
   ``That represents a de facto price reduction, and usually a
price reduction is followed by higher demand,'' said George Pipas,
manager for sales analysis at Ford Motor Co. ``There is no doubt
that this is going to be the best year ever for new cars and light
trucks in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Ballew, General Motors Corp.'s general director of
marketing and industry analysis, said the current economic
convergence benefits almost everyone, although it makes for keen
competition among manufacturers and dealers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty hard to find an economic climate that gets much
better. And the improvement in affordability has been astounding in
the last five years. The average monthly payment in relation to
monthly income is at its lowest point in almost five years,''
Ballew said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, with so many buyers prowling the nation's showrooms,
manufacturers and dealers are feeling the pressure to set their
products apart from scores of models in the marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a real challenge to improve margins in this market
despite the fact we're delivering about 17 million units,'' said
Ballew. ``From a laboratory standpoint, it's fascinating to look
at, but when you are on the ground engaged in the hand-to-hand
combat, it loses some of its luster. But we'll take 17 million
units.''
</P>
<P>
   The competition is keen because this is a broad-based splurge.
Consider that:
</P>
<P>
   During July, sales of Rolls-Royce and Bentley automobiles _
which cost several hundred thousand dollars apiece _ rose 15
percent in North America vs. the year-ago period. The strong U.S.
market helped drive up the company's sales worldwide by 13.2
percent on an annual basis, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   Daewoo Motor America, a unit of the financially troubled South
Korean company, has recorded seven consecutive months of sales
increases. The company has been aggressively expanding its U.S.
retail network.
</P>
<P>
   Nissan's North American sales total for July was the highest
since March 1997. The company has had eight straight months of
annualized sales gains.
</P>
<P>
   Hyundai Motor America said its July sales soared 104 percent, to
17,958 units, from the year-ago period. So far this year, sales are
64 percent ahead of the 1998 level.
</P>
<P>
   Volkswagen of America Inc. recorded its best July in 19 years,
with sales up 19.5 percent. Year-to-date, the German automaker's
U.S. sales have reached 179,240 units, up 39.9 percent from 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Ford sold more cars in June than any month in its 96-year
history.
</P>
<P>
   And even when an automaker's sales slide, the news is not all
bad. Porsche Cars North America said sales in the United States
during July fell 24 percent on an annual basis. But this is due to
the fact the stock is low because of an accelerated sales pace
earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   So far during 1999, sales of Porsche models are running 16
percent ahead of the 1998 level.

METS BEAT CARDINALS, 7-4  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JUDY BATTISTA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mist filled Shea Stadium Saturday, and every weekend
warrior in town felt a little bit of creakiness. But when a
starting pitcher like Kenny Rogers feels a twinge when he gets out
of bed, it is a more worrisome development.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers woke up Saturday, sneezed a few times and felt a pain
between his shoulder blades that insured that he would be
ineffective. But the Mets are in the pennant race because of a
balance of powerful offense, enigmatic starting pitching and nearly
flawless relief. Saturday, as they have all season, the Mets relied
on a sterling effort from the bullpen _ it has worked 242/3
consecutive scoreless innings _ plus well-timed hits and Mike
Piazza's 29th home run of the season to beat the Cardinals, 7-4.
The victory kept the Mets (75-48) in first place in the National
League East by two percentage points over the Braves, who beat the
Padres.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're fortunate we outlasted them and the rain,'' said Piazza,
whose three-run homer in the first inning was his sixth home run in
his last seven games.
</P>
<P>
   It was obvious almost immediately that the Mets would need a lot
of good fortune to prevail Saturday, or even to play. Until minutes
before game time, it seemed unlikely that the game would start, but
then the tarp was rolled off. During the early innings, when bulky
clouds hung low over the stadium, even the home plate umpire Bruce
Froemming expressed his doubts to Piazza about whether the game
could be completed.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers probably wished it had been postponed from the start. He
had hoped that warming up would relieve the pulling he felt in his
back. But the spasm limited his ability to finish his pitches. They
were high in the strike zone with little velocity. He fell behind
almost every hitter.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals' leadoff hitter, Edgar Renteria, blasted a double
to right-center field that Benny Agbayani approached hesitantly,
tiptoeing through a soaked warning track like a child splashing
through puddles. After J.D. Drew bunted Renteria to third and was
safe at first, Rogers narrowly escaped an encounter with Mark
McGwire. McGwire cracked an enormous shot that drifted just left of
the left-field foul pole, only to later look at a Rogers changeup
on the corner for strike three.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers then walked Ray Lankford to load the bases and Fernando
Tatis hit a shattered-bat blooper to shallow right that scored the
first two runs. A rout seemed imminent. But Craig Paquette hit a
grounder up the middle that Rey Ordonez grasped in a full face-down
stretch. Flopping once, he tossed the ball with his glove hand to
Edgardo Alfonzo to start a double play that allowed Rogers to
escape, down by 2-0.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some players have more errors than their whole infield has,''
St. Louis Manager Tony La Russa said.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza's three-run homer gave the Mets the lead in the bottom of
the first, but no amount of cushion would be enough for Rogers. He
struggled through the second and third innings, but Pat Mahomes,
who last pitched Aug. 11 against San Diego, was already warming up.
Rogers gave up singles to McGwire and Lankford to start the third
before Tatis doubled over Rickey Henderson to score McGwire.
Henderson, like Agbayani, was tentative near the puddly warning
track.
</P>
<P>
   With the game tied, Bobby Valentine visited the mound with the
trainer Fred Hina. Rogers had hoped to get through five innings,
especially because the Mets play a doubleheader on Sunday, and he
knew Valentine would want to save the bullpen. But Rogers gave up
another run to give the Cardinals a 4-3 lead and, when the inning
was done, so was he. He had allowed four runs on seven hits, but
Valentine said he was likely to make his next start, Wednesday
against Houston. ``I don't see this as being a lingering problem,''
Rogers said. ``I've had it before but it doesn't usually affect the
way I pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, after the Mets tied the score in the bottom of the
third when Piazza (2 for 2 with three runs) singled and later
scored, the bullpen was anxious to get to work. The starting
rotation got its first two complete games of the season during the
road trip to the West Coast, so the oft-used relievers were
unusually rested and restless. ``We're all down there pretty
antsy,'' said Turk Wendell, who allowed just one hit in one and a
third innings.
</P>
<P>
   Mahomes retired the side in the fourth, then struck out McGwire
(he was limited to one hit in four at-bats) to start the fifth.
``When he steps into the box, and everybody stands up, you feel a
rush,'' Mahomes said. ``You don't want to be the guy on
`SportsCenter.'''
</P>
<P>
   Mahomes got through the fifth and sixth, and after Henderson's
two-out single scored Agbayani to give the Mets a 5-4 lead, Mahomes
struck out Renteria to start the seventh. Mahomes walked Drew to
bring McGwire to bat again, and Valentine wasn't going to try his
luck with that matchup twice. Mahomes, who allowed no hits or runs
in three and a third innings, was replaced by the excitable
Wendell.
</P>
<P>
   Wendell's best pitch is his slider, but Piazza, who thinks
Wendell needs to mix up his pitches to be most effective, called
for his fastball. On a 1-2 count, Wendell zipped a pitch past
McGwire as flashbulbs blinked in the gloaming to capture McGwire's
third strikeout of the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I'm out there, I don't see or hear anything else,''
Wendell said. ``You're subconsciously conscious. When I was done
today, it was a blur. When you're not successful in those
situations, you bang your head on the wall for three days. When
you're successful, it blows by you.''

 TURKISH BUILDERS CRITICIZED AFTER QUAKE LOSSES
 &HT;    (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALIZA MARCUS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   ISTANBUL _ Turkish building contractors have gone into hiding to
avoid angry survivors of the earthquake that killed more than
12,000 people as engineering experts Saturday accused the
government of not protecting people against shoddy buildings.
</P>
<P>
   The government arrested three builders as Prime Minister Bulent
Ecevit pledged to go after contractors who built that substandard
housing _ among more than 115,000 buildings demolished or rendered
uninhabitable after Tuesday's quake.
</P>
<P>
   But engineering experts demanded that the government investigate
itself instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only the state can stop people from building without proper
plans, from using bad materials. They are the ones to blame and
there must be an investigation that starts with local authorities
and goes all the way to the top,'' said Cemal Gokce, director of
the Building Engineers Association in Istanbul.
</P>
<P>
   ``If all the buildings had been constructed the way they should,
then I think a huge portion would have stayed intact _ we created
this disaster and we must start learning how to live in an
earthquake zone,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The quake hit middle-class and working-class neighborhoods with
almost equal vengeance. Damage stretched through Turkey's
industrial heartland, from Istanbul's outskirts halfway to the
capital, Ankara, and down the coast of the Marmara Sea. Six people
were pulled alive from the rubble Saturday, but authorities fear as
many as 35,000 more missing people have perished.
</P>
<P>
   Rescue workers searching for survivors under the huge slabs of
concrete, stacks of bricks, and twisted metal poles that make up a
building said it did seem that poor construction was to blame for
at least some of the carnage.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you go down a street and the first two buildings are
relatively unscathed, the third has some damage and the fourth is a
pile of rubble _ you have to conclude that the difference is
because of how the fourth building was constructed,'' said Hugh
Parmer, assistant administrator of the US Agency for International
Development's bureau of humanitarian response, which has a rescue
team in Izmit.
</P>
<P>
   Survivors and others have complained that faulty material was
used for some buildings, that authorities did not take action
against clearly substandard housing and that shopowners on ground
floors sometimes cut through supporting walls to increase their
space.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all knew the building was made badly because it used to
shake when trucks drove by, but we did not think it would
collapse,'' said Ali Atalan, 24, whose mother died when their
apartment building in Izmit collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   Turks who saw their homes fall around them, watched their
children die under the wreckage, or heard the screams of friends
trapped beneath the rubble are in no mood to forgive those
responsible for substandard buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Contractor Veli Gocer was one of those builders who went into
hiding, fearful of retribution from angry survivors because it is
known he mixed cement for some buildings with salt water. Salt
water is not supposed to be used because over time the salt eats
into the cement, weakening it dangerously.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody told me to stop what I was doing,'' Gocer was quoted
Saturday as telling Turkish newspapers in telephone calls from his
hiding place. ``I wasn't warned and the state didn't say `hold on
brother, you can't use this' _ later I learned better and started
using different materials,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Police also detained three owners of construction companies in
the western city of Eskisehir on negligence charges.
</P>
<P>
   One building expert said Turkey's building codes related to
protecting against quakes were advanced but the problem was that
contractors ignored the rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't follow procedures because contractors are not
licensed, they don't have any liability insurance, and they don't
understand the complications of the earthquake codes,'' said Ahmet
Cakmak, a professor of civil engineering at Princeton University.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem is that many areas in the hard-hit Izmit
province were built on filled-in lakes or landfill covering the
edges of the Marmara Sea, making them much more susceptible to
earthquake tremors.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are not excellent city planning rules and they
(planners) don't look at the land based on which areas are most
resistant to earthquakes,'' said Cakmak.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, engineers and architects started combing the region,
trying to decide which damaged buildings were safe enough to allow
people to go back home.
</P>
<P>
   But engineering experts who have followed the construction boom
in western Turkish cities _ overflowing with migrants fleeing
poverty and the Kurdish guerrilla war in the eastern part of the
country _ warned that it was not enough to check buildings with
obvious damage.
</P>
<P>
   Quake experts have predicted that another big quake could hit
the same region or Istanbul itself within the next few decades,
raising fears that even buildings that look safe or survived this
disaster may not make it through another one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost every building built in the last 30 years has to be
gone over and checked because many were made without proper
planning or illegally,'' said Gokce, referring to buildings in
Istanbul and the region hit by the quake.
</P>
<P>
   The outcry over building practices comes on top of accusations
that Turkey was woefully unprepared for such a natural disaster
despite the fact that the area hit lies on a known fault line and
for years experts warned of a major earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   Turkish officials say they are doing their best, given the level
of damage, with more than 30,000 people believed buried under the
rubble, hospitals totally overwhelmed and communications, water and
electricity cut in the areas hit hardest.
</P>
<P>
   But people frantically trying to dig through concrete and brick
to get at buried relatives and friends complained that rescue teams
arrived too late to get to many people and they called on the
government to mobilize more groups for a last- minute dig.
</P>
<P>
   ``We managed to save a woman who was pregnant from one building
after I forced the driver of a excavating machine to come to the
place by threatening him with a knife,'' said a 25-year-old man in
the Golcuk who would give only his first name, Seyfi.
</P>
<P>
   ``No help was provided, we didn't see any official rescue
workers until Friday,'' he said.

VOTERS SEEM TO HAVE HIGHER TOLERANCE FOR FAILINGS OF POLITICIANS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RON HUTCHESON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When then-Sen. Al Gore confessed to past marijuana
use as a presidential candidate in 1987, reporters asked Republican
front-runner George Bush if he had ever tried the illegal weed.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' the vice president replied, ``but I'd hate to speak for
my kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the drug issue is roiling another presidential campaign, and
Bush's oldest son, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, is struggling with
questions about cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   But much has changed since Gore became the first presidential
candidate to admit using illegal drugs. Aging baby boomers and the
numbing effect of previous scandals seem to have raised voter
tolerance to new heights.
</P>
<P>
   In New Mexico, Republican Gov. Gary Johnson was elected despite
his admission that he tried both marijuana and cocaine in the
1970s. Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura of the Reform Party suffered no
discernible backlash after disclosing in a tell-all autobiography
that he has used marijuana, visited prostitutes and sometimes
forgoes underwear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can remember when Adlai Stevenson's divorce was a problem,''
said Gary Jacobson, a political science professor at the University
of California in San Diego. ``The tolerable kinds of social
behavior for politicians has expanded quite dramatically.''
</P>
<P>
   After rebuffing the question for weeks, Bush answered it
partially last week by saying he had not tried illegal drugs for
the past 25 years. He will not say what might have happened in his
younger years _ before he turned 28 _ and that has led some voters
to draw their own conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   Persistent digging by reporters and political opponents has
failed to produce any evidence of illegal drug use by Bush. The
media frenzy does not seem to have slowed his drive to the
Republican presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   In polls, focus groups and interviews, most voters shrug off the
controversy. If they're disgusted with anyone, they're disgusted
with the news media for refusing to drop the issue.
</P>
<P>
   But, as they did with President Clinton, voters show themselves
to be of two minds. With Clinton, a majority of Americans concluded
he was a poor role model but a good president. In a poll last week
by Fox News, a majority of respondents believed that Bush should
answer the question about drug use but more than two-thirds said
they ultimately didn't care if he had tried cocaine as a young man.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we're young, we all do things. All of us make mistakes,''
said Terry Sawyer, a Bush admirer who showed up to greet the
candidate at a recent campaign stop in Roanoke, Va. ``It's what he
can do for the country now, not what he did as a kid.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts and political observers cite several reasons for voter
indifference to the subject.
</P>
<P>
   Some theorize that personal flaws are more acceptable because
presidents are no longer viewed as larger-than-life figures.
Revelations of personal misconduct by President Clinton, former
President John Kennedy and other previous White House occupants
have underscored the reality of human frailties.
</P>
<P>
   But the single biggest factor may be the influence of baby
boomers, many of whom are squirming with drug questions from their
children.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest national survey of drug use, nearly a third of
adults over age 35 admitted using illegal drugs at some point in
their lives. Nearly 30 percent confessed to smoking marijuana;
about 10 percent said they had used cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   ``We say we want higher values, but the baby boomers know what
it was like to do drugs back then,'' said Steve Roberts, former
chairman of the Iowa Republican Party. ``It's easy to just condemn,
but the fact is, we have met the enemy and it is us.''
</P>
<P>
   Some family education experts agree with Bush's argument that
spelling out past misconduct sends the wrong message to children.
</P>
<P>
   ``If parents used drugs when they were kids, they don't have to
bring it up, and they don't have to communicate that to their
kids,'' said Sylvia B. Rimm, a pediatrics professor and host of a
National Public Radio program on parenting. ``If kids bring it up,
I think they have to answer honestly. They don't have to give all
the details.''
</P>
<P>
   In making his milestone 1987 drug admission, Gore said he
discussed his experiences with his children shortly before meeting
with reporters. Gore, 51, said he started smoking marijuana with
his wife, Tipper, when they were in college. He said he also used
it when he was in the Army in Vietnam and on a couple of occasions
in the early 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   The question arose when Douglas Ginsburg withdrew his nomination
to the Supreme Court because of the furor surrounding his admission
that he had smoked marijuana with his law school students in
California.
</P>
<P>
   Other politicians who have acknowledged smoking marijuana
include Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt and former House Speaker
Newt Gingrich. Clinton became the butt of countless jokes by saying
that he smoked it, but did not inhale.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1980s, the generational split over drugs led to
friction between the Bush administration and the FBI over
background checks for government workers, according to former White
House counsel C. Boyden Gray. Bush's advisers favored a more
tolerant view because so many applicants had experimented with
drugs in their youths. The FBI backed a hard-line approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over time, I think they realized life had changed,'' Gray
said. ``They were all of a generation that were reaching their
retirement years. As more and more senior FBI members retired, more
and more younger people moved up, and they were more realistic
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say that anything goes. While some jurisdictions
have decriminalized marijuana, the use and sale of cocaine remains
a serious offense. The emergence of the highly addictive crack
derivative has also tarnished cocaine's image in some circles as a
hip, relatively harmless recreational outlet.
</P>
<P>
   Most experts agree that voter attitudes toward Bush could change
dramatically if his acknowledged youthful indiscretions turn out to
be something more serious.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic political consultant Jennifer Laszlo said she was
taken aback when a group of Iowa voters dismissed the cocaine
question as insignificant in a recent focus group.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were a lot more tolerant of cocaine use than I would
have suspected because I'm totally disgusted by cocaine use,
whether it's his or anybody else's,'' said Laszlo, 35. ``But they
had a lot of follow-up questions about how recently he did it and
how much he did it. How recently and how much really seems to
matter.''

GOVERNOR PROMISES ETHICS PUSH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL CROWLEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In his first public comments on the most scandalous
week of his term, Governor Paul Cellucci promised Saturday to crack
down on state officials who violate ethical standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to tolerate the misuse of public funds. We're
not going to tolerate the misuse of public office,'' he said.
``When we find that that has happened we will take action, and we
will take action swiftly.''
</P>
<P>
   Returning from a vacation in Florida, a stern-faced Cellucci
sought to downplay the controversies that ousted Massachusetts Port
Authority director Peter Blute, and endangered the job of Economic
Development director Carolyn Boviard.
</P>
<P>
   But he acknowledged that Blute's departure may cost him
politically, as he pushes ahead in his effort to build a new runway
at congested Logan airport. Blute had been leading the Logan
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Losing Peter Blute is not a good thing for our effort to get
this new runway,'' Cellucci said. ``He was doing a very good job on
that effort.''
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci returns to a more turbulent political scene than the
one he left a week ago, with investigations under way into
administration officials and his longtime friend Alexander
``Sandy'' Tennant, a veteran state GOP power broker, and headlines
filled with tales of partying and misbehavior in his
administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I obviously wasn't very happy to hear what happened here,''
Cellucci said.
</P>
<P>
   The governor also suggested that Tennant needs ``to turn his
life around.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor, however, defended Boviard, who is now being
questioned about whether she had a romantic relationship with her
top aide, David Shagoury. Shagoury resigned Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Saying he believes Boviard has done ``a very good job'' in her
post, Cellucci noted she is in the middle of a ``rather bitter''
divorce.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci would not comment on whether he believes Boviard had
the affair with Shagoury, as staffers have alleged, or whether she
would be fired if the allegations prove true. Boviard has denied
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are allegations and there are denials,'' Cellucci said.
``We're taking a look at whether there are any other problems
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci is awaiting a report from his chief legal counsel, Len
Lewin, on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Shagoury was forced to resign after allegedly threatening to
retaliate in job reviews against subordinates he believed were
gossiping about him and Boviard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there was a management problem at that agency that has
been taken care of,'' Cellucci said.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci used harsher words to describe the Tuesday Massport
cruise captured in photographs in the Boston Herald. The newspaper
showed Blute aboard a cabin cruiser with Tennant and several young
women, including one who flashed her breasts for a Herald
photographer.
</P>
<P>
   The cruise was paid for with taxpayer dollars, although Blute
reimbursed Massport after the pictures were published.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the young woman aboard the boat who bared her chest,
Cellucci cautiously replied: ``I don't think that was a very good
thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci was unforgiving of Tennant, saying ``It's pretty clear
to me that he can't be helpful to me and he can't be helpful to the
Republican Party.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor added that he has not spoken to Tennant since the
cruise, and that he has no plans to do so. But asked whether he
still considers Tennant a close friend, Cellucci hesitantly
replied, ``Sure.''
</P>
<P>
   This spring, Tennant, formerly Cellucci's campaign chairman, was
charged with drunken driving after being found slumped over the
wheel of his car at 5 a.m. on a Brookline street. His trial is
scheduled for next month.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of us thought his drunk-driving charge would be a
wake-up call, but obviously it wasn't,'' Cellucci said of Tennant.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the turmoil back in Boston, Cellucci said he never
considered returning early from his vacation and he was able to
relax throughout the week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in pretty constant contact with the lieutenant governor
(Jane Swift) and I know she had things well under control,''
Cellucci said. ``So I was able to still enjoy my trip.''
</P>
<P>
   Blute's cruise Tuesday, and revelations of a similar trip last
summer, have prompted Massport to investigate all agency-funded
charter boat trips to determine whether public money was misused.
</P>
<P>
   In another development, the Coast Guard in Boston said the
captain of the Nauticus, the boat rented for Tuesday's trip, was
not certified to charter passengers. The captain, Steve Davis,
could face penalties of up to $5,000 for each day he violated
regulations.

IT'S TREASURE OR TRASH ON `ANTIQUES ROADSHOW' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By YVONNE ABRAHAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PROVIDENCE _ Every one of the 6,500 ``Antiques Roadshow''
devotees who came to the Rhode Island Convention Center ON Saturday
knows this story:
</P>
<P>
   A nice elderly woman from New Jersey buys a little table at a
garage sale for $25, puts her telephone on it and thinks nothing of
it for years. Then the PBS show comes to town, and she wonders what
her find is really worth, so she takes it along.
</P>
<P>
   Appraiser Leigh Keno, who with his twin brother, Leslie, is now
undoubtedly the most famous American furniture expert in the
country, can barely breathe when he sees it.
</P>
<P>
   Keno tells her the mahogany card table, labeled by furniture
makers John and Thomas Seymour, is one of only seven or eight such
pieces known to exist.
</P>
<P>
   Then comes the moment every viewer waits for.
</P>
<P>
   How much is that little table worth? There is a pause, then the
familiar tinkling of bells as the price is flashed across the
bottom of the screen: $250,000.
</P>
<P>
   For a moment, she looks as if she might swoon. So does Keno.
</P>
<P>
   But wait, there's more. Several months later, the table goes to
auction on an especially good day and fetches $490,000.
</P>
<P>
   The nice woman from New Jersey and others like her are the
reason the ``Antiques Roadshow'' is the highest-rated prime-time
PBS program in the country.
</P>
<P>
   She is also the reason all those people showed up at Saturday,
hoping to strike it similarly rich with all manner of tchotchke
snagged at garage sales, inherited from ailing aunts, or dug out
from under piles of junk in the basement.
</P>
<P>
   The show, taping its fourth season, is based on a long-running
English program, and inspires a quasireligious devotion among
audiences and hopeful collectors. Impeccably dressed Chris Jussel,
the presenter, and the appraisers, like the Keno brothers, had
participants in awe Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Unhappy endings are also a part of the show's appeal: Many
viewers will sheepishly admit to drawing as much pleasure from low
valuations as high ones, as long-held family myths are debunked and
prized hand-me-downs are exposed as fakes. But participants
obviously hope for happier outcomes.
</P>
<P>
   They brought cigar store Indians and snakeskin bags, tattered
rugs and Aunt Jemima door-stops. They brought ancient-looking
swords and sad old dolls.
</P>
<P>
   And they waited. Many arrived as early as 5 a.m. Some _ as many
as a hundred, organizers said _ spent the night camping outside the
convention center. Once inside the building, a huge line snaked
around a dozen barriers, and most of the hopeful visitors waited
three hours before getting near the appraisers.
</P>
<P>
   Cheryl Wright, of Rhode Island, brought an elaborate jade, gold,
and ivory Chinese-style box that was intriguing enough to get her a
taped segment on the show. The vast majority of participants don't
make it to the cameras, but receiving free appraisals from experts
who have become as familiar as actors seems payoff enough for most
of them.
</P>
<P>
   Expert Lark E. Mason Jr. of Sotheby's, New York, had never seen
anything like the box. It was made by Edward Farber, a famous maker
of fine-quality desk articles. It was made of 18-carat gold, and
jade and ivory panels taken from a wealthy Chinese 16th century
tomb.
</P>
<P>
   Big find. As much as $125,000.
</P>
<P>
   But while most ``Antiques Roadshow'' hopefuls might jump and
yelp at such a valuation, Wright was not too surprised.
</P>
<P>
   She'd been given the box by a wealthy family friend when she was
10, she said, and he had taken out high insurance on it for her.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the value of the box, this was not the ideal
``Roadshow'' experience, and several members of the production
staff seemed disappointed: the show's allure, after all, depends on
suspense and surprise, the sense that the average viewer, too,
could have a fortune lying around the house and not know it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The show is accessible to everyone,'' said Anne Zeiser,
publicist for WGBH. ``Everybody has a family story, a relic from
the past, an attic or a basement. The show gives you all these
little vignettes, each building up to that moment when you find out
if they've got trash or treasure.''
</P>
<P>
   Rob Van Varick of Rochester, N.Y., hoped his Queen Anne mirror
would be worth a fortune. Van Varick, 20, who arrived at 7:30 a.m.,
knew the history of the mirror backwards, it having been in his
family for a long time. And he had a typewritten account of its
provenance, written in 1899, which said the mirror had once
belonged to 18th century American statesman Jonathan Trumbull, an
ancestor of his.
</P>
<P>
   ``I gotta work myself down. I can't get too excited. I can't get
my hopes up,'' Van Varick said.
</P>
<P>
   While he was waiting, he spotted the Keno brothers working
nearby.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're the best, the Keno brothers,'' he said. ``When they
get excited, they get all giddy, `Oh, I saw this one in line; I saw
you from afar.' ''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Van Varick's mirror, dated at about 1750, was
appraised at about $1,500, since the glass and gilding had been
replaced. But the provenance added another $500 to its value. Van
Varick was disappointed, but not broken. ``It was fun just being
here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And in the end, his mirror had been appraised by the Leslie
Keno.

 FEW CLEAR CLUES IN KILLING OF SOCIAL WORKER
 &HT;    (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ELLEMENT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   NASHUA, N.H. _ His friends said Daniel Ayer was a troubled man
as he waited for social worker Mark Rowland to make his first visit
to Ayer's home to counsel the family and their developmentally
delayed and hyperactive 5-year-old son.
</P>
<P>
   And, police said, Ayer had a rifle.
</P>
<P>
   Ayer, 34, told friends that he was on medical disability from
his job with a Nashua construction firm, that he had been told the
utilities to his apartment would be shut off for nonpayment, and
that he had been served with an eviction notice.
</P>
<P>
   He said he and his wife, Joan, had been battling with state
social service agencies over the care of their only child, Daniel,
disputes that landed them in court where they were prodded to
participate in the Nashua Children's Program.
</P>
<P>
   But no one has yet said why Ayer got into a quarrel outside his
apartment building Friday with Rowland, 36, who worked for the
child care program, and allegedly shot the social worker in the
head.
</P>
<P>
   Rowland, according to the center's executive director, David
Villiotti, met the Ayers in court and his home visit was a critical
component of the program to keep the family together.
</P>
<P>
   Villiotti said that while there was a risk the child could be
removed from the home, ``That wouldn't have been the topic of the
conversation, because our goal was to keep them together.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to make sense out of it,'' Villiotti said of
Rowland's murder. ``We sure can't.''
</P>
<P>
   Authorities did not provide any clarifying information Saturday
as Ayer was arraigned in Nashua District Court on a count of
second-degree murder.
</P>
<P>
   Ayer appeared through a closed-circuit television hookup between
the courthouse and the police station. Ayer's wife, her sister and
brother-in-law, and a friend, Pat Lajoie, were in the courtroom.
Ayer was ordered held without bail pending his next court
appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Rowland was shot in the middle of Hanover Street at
about 11 a.m. Friday. Ayer was arrested in neighboring Hudson a few
minutes later, and police said they found a .30-caliber rifle and
ammunition in his car.
</P>
<P>
   Lajoie, her boyfriend, James Trudelle, who is a neighbor of the
Ayers, and a coworker of the slain social worker said they did not
know why Ayer allegedly used a rifle he had inherited from his
father to shoot Rowland.
</P>
<P>
   ``He must have had a lot of anger in him that he did not show,''
said Trudelle. ``It must have boiled to the top and he just
snapped.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ayers constantly told friends that they could not get proper
care for their son, despite a legion of social workers visiting the
apartment where they had taken special precautions to protect him:
kitchen cabinets were locked; every window was locked shut because
Danny had once jumped out of one; and he was usually never left
alone.
</P>
<P>
   Trudelle said the defendant's parents and grandmother died
within the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   He said Ayer rarely drank, never to excess. He would almost
never lose his temper at work, and he kept a collection of guns in
a locker bolted to the floor and ceiling for safety, Trudelle said.
</P>
<P>
   Residents held a prayer service, led by neighbor Carl LeBlanc,
which was attended by Rowland's coworkers and members of the
Manchester Church of Christ, where Rowland was an active member.
Rowland's friends told Ayer's friends that they were praying for
the suspect and his family as strongly as they were for Rowland,
his widow, and their 2-year-old child.
</P>
<P>
   Joan Ayer told friends that welfare officials told her they
could help her financially _ but only if she divorced her husband.
Their 10th anniversary is Friday.
</P>
<P>
   As her husband sat in jail, Joan Ayer sat silently Friday night,
lost in her thoughts. Only occasionally would she speak, friends
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe he did that,'' she said repeatedly. ``I can't
believe he did that.''

JONES CELEBRATES, BUT IT'S A VICTORY BY HER HUSBAND  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEVILLE, Spain _ Marion Jones shouted with joy, hugged her
husband and celebrated the first American gold medal of the world
track and field championships with a long line of television
cameras zeroing in on the moment.
</P>
<P>
   She then walked away and let her husband, C.J. Hunter, explain
his victory in the shot-put.
</P>
<P>
   There is no longer just one world champion in the Jones
household, and though Jones could end up with four gold medals when
the nine days of competition here are done, Hunter will be the
first one to hear ``The Star-Spangled Banner'' from the podium in
Seville when he is awarded his medal on Sunday, shortly before
Jones makes her bid to win the women's 100-meter dash.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not about bragging rights,'' Hunter said after his
unexpected success. ``It's a family thing. We'll take the bragging
rights over the other families, but not against each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter and Jones met when Hunter was coaching track and field at
the University of North Carolina and Jones was a star athlete
there. They were married last October, and they honeymooned in
Belize, the nation where Jones' mother was born, swimming with the
dolphins as they dived in the warm waters. Now, they have something
else to savor together this off season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tonight, we'll go back to the hotel; we'll shake hands, I'll
give her a kiss, and that will be it,'' Hunter said. ``We'll
celebrate in October.''
</P>
<P>
   There will also be a celebration in the Dragila residence in
Pocatello, Idaho, after Stacy Dragila became the first women's
world champion outdoors in the pole vault, tying the world record
of 15 feet 1 inch in the process.
</P>
<P>
   The woman whose record Dragila tied, Emma George of Australia,
has been one of the discipline's pioneers, but George, who could do
no better than a tie for 14th Saturday night, has not been as
successful a trailblazer as Dragila in major competitions. In 1997,
Dragila won the first women's indoor world championship in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Now Dragila, a former heptathlete with dark sunglasses and a
sunny disposition, has done the same outdoors by outlasting a
technically smoother vaulter from Ukraine, Anzhela Balakhonova, the
reigning world champion, in a grueling, highly entertaining duel
that did not end until 11:15 on this warm Saturday evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to get over 15 feet coming into this, and I
didn't care how,'' Dragila said.
</P>
<P>
   Dragila already had cleared 15 feet in a competition on the
beach in Santa Barbara, Calif., in June, winning $100,000, but the
International Amateur Athletic Federation did not sanction that
event. She could have won $100,00 more tonight if she had jumped
just a half-inch higher, but after she and Balakhonova both cleared
14 feet 11 inches (4.55 meters), they were not permitted to set the
bar at the record-breaking height of 15-1{, or 4.61 meters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to respect the progression of heights,'' said Dragila,
who tried and failed three times at 4.65 meters and then settled
happily for the $30,000 first prize.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the first time Hunter, an imposing 30-year-old, has
won a medal at a world championship. In 1997 he won the bronze in
Athens, and in 1995 he won the silver at the world indoor
championships.
</P>
<P>
   But despite his 6-1, 320-pound frame, Hunter has thrown in the
shadow of another strapping American, John Godina, who arrived as
the two-time defending world champion and with the best throw of
the year to his credit.
</P>
<P>
   But Godina looked ill at ease from the start Saturday night,
fouling on five of his six attempts. His one legal throw traveled
66-9\, good enough for seventh place and not nearly good enough to
compete with Hunter's final throw of 71-6, a personal best.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to say what went wrong; everything's spinning right
now,'' said Godina, who will have a chance to right himself in the
discus.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter did not used to spin at all when he put the shot, but he
converted from the glide style once he moved to Colorado after
graduating from Penn State in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night, after he whirled around the ring in the Estadio
Olimpico and released the shot for the last time, he was grinning
broadly as soon as it left his hand. When it landed, he threw his
head back, thrust both hands skyward and did two bench presses in
the air and then began windmilling his massive arms, the chalk
shining white on his neck under the lights.
</P>
<P>
   After the silver medalist, Oliver-Sven Buder of Germany, and the
bronze medalist, Alexander Bagach, proved incapable of besting
Hunter's final throw, he was soon draping his arms around Jones'
neck. ``She told me she was proud of me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jones already had made Hunter proud of her Saturday morning by
qualifying for Monday's final in the long jump with a leap of 22-4\
and then recording the fastest 100-meter time for women in the
world this season _ 10.76 seconds _ to win her quarterfinal in the
evening.
</P>
<P>
   Not many people saw it _ the stadium was less than half full _
but those who bought tickets witnessed plenty of speed on the new
Mondo track. Before Jones ran, another American, Inger Miller, and
Ekaterini Thanou of Greece had set personal bests by winning their
heats in 10.86 seconds. ``I said, `Hey, why don't I join the
club?''' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Though she did not manage to beat her personal best of 10.65
seconds or threaten the world record of 10.49, Jones did reassert
her dominance. ``Watch out for a world record,'' she said of Sunday
night's 100 semifinals and finals. ''I'm not saying from me. But
watch the men's sprinters. That track is fast, fast, fast.''
</P>
<P>
   The fastest man in history is the American Maurice Greene.
Saturday night in the quarterfinals he did not come close to his
world record of 9.79 seconds but still managed a very impressive
9.91. ``My coach told me to show them a little bit but don't show
them all of it,'' Greene said. ``I believe I did that.''

WITNESSES IN CIVELLA CASE PREPARE FOR THEIR OWN TRIAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK MORRIS  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Two men who
helped send the reputed head of the Kansas City mob to prison in a
pharmaceutical fraud scheme now face charges in a similar but
larger case.
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1991, Louie Ferro Jr. and Wilbur Swift served as federal
witnesses against Anthony ``Tony Ripe'' Civella and two other men
who were convicted of buying drugs worth about $1 million at huge
discounts for nursing homes and reselling them at higher prices to
wholesalers.
</P>
<P>
   Federal investigators have called Civella's conviction a
``serious blow'' to the leadership of organized crime in Kansas
City.
</P>
<P>
   Last month Ferro, his father, Louie Ferro Sr., Swift and Kevin
Staley were charged with operating a similar pharmaceutical
diversion scheme that brought them at least $8 million between 1995
and early 1999. All four have pleaded not guilty.
</P>
<P>
   No trial date has been set. As the case evolves, however, it
will spotlight the role that middlemen, such as Ferro and his
partners, play in the complex system that determines how much
Americans pay for prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The crux of the government's case is that the four defendants
defrauded drug manufacturers when they bought discounted
pharmaceuticals meant for nursing homes and then resold them to
wholesalers.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview, the four said they merely used a
legitimate discount offered by manufacturers to deliver cheaper
prescription drugs to wholesale customers.
</P>
<P>
   Ferro Jr. said the government should be more concerned about
allegations of price gouging by manufacturers than with prosecuting
him for helping to hold down the cost of health care.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's the matter with discounts if the end user is getting
the same good product?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Whitley, a spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office in
Kansas City, says the safety of patients who depend on those
products is a serious issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Drugs can be stored, and often are stored, in improper
environments, such as excessive heat, cold or humidity,'' Whitley
said. ``It may be a matter of drugs being stored for so long that
they go out of date. Potency and efficacy are serious concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   Once prescription drugs are diverted, regulators cannot track
them, making the recall of defective drugs difficult or impossible,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Whitley said the indictment against the four made no allegation
that anyone became ill from the drugs they sold.
</P>
<P>
   Ferro Jr. said he and his partners met or exceeded industry
standards for handling, shipping and tracking the pharmaceuticals
they handled.
</P>
<P>
   Crossing paths
</P>
<P>
   Ferro Jr., a Kansas City pharmacist, and Swift, a California
drug wholesaler, first met in the coffee shop of a Las Vegas hotel
in the summer of 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Swift was looking for an institutional pharmacy _ a store that
distributes only to nursing homes _ to buy prescription drugs at a
substantial discount and then resell them to a wholesale firm he
co-owned, according to testimony from the Civella trial.
</P>
<P>
   Ferro Jr. appeared to be a prime candidate for the deal. He had
opened such a pharmacy in Kansas City the year before in a
partnership with Civella's son-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   At the Las Vegas meeting, which included other partners in the
Kansas City pharmacy venture, Swift pitched the idea of a
diversion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them that diversion was legally done, and that we would
buy certain merchandise from them, give them a profit, their cost
plus 25 percent,'' Swift testified.
</P>
<P>
   Ferro Jr. testified that he agreed to explore the legality of
the deal. He got his answer later in 1986 after he attended a
pharmacy convention in New Orleans. There, he said, he learned that
agreements with drug manufacturers prevented him from reselling the
drugs on the wholesale market.
</P>
<P>
   When he returned to Kansas City, Ferro Jr. testified, he raised
the issue with another partner in the pharmacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't believe it was kosher,'' Ferro Jr. testified.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of 1986, Ferro Jr. had a falling out with Civella's
son-in-law and later left the nursing-home pharmacy business.
</P>
<P>
   And two years after that, Swift found himself cut out of the
Kansas City diversion by a former business partner.
</P>
<P>
   Their lives then took different paths.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer of 1989, Swift was convicted of 24 counts of wire
fraud in Phoenix for a drug-diversion scheme.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few months after his testimony in the Civella case, Louie
Ferro Jr. decided to run for Congress. At the time, he brushed
aside questions about his testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ``That involved my old partners that I separated from,'' Ferro
Jr. had said. ``I have nothing to hide. Some people may raise
questions, but I don't think it will hurt my campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferro Jr. lost to incumbent Alan Wheat in the Aug. 4, 1992,
primary.
</P>
<P>
   After serving a prison term for fraud, Civella was released in
June 1996. The government has not alleged that Civella or either of
the other men convicted with him were involved in the most recent
pharmaceutical diversion case.
</P>
<P>
   Discount drugs
</P>
<P>
   After Civella's conviction, Ferro Jr. and Swift got into
business.
</P>
<P>
   From May 1995 through January 1999, Swift, the Ferros and Staley
signed agreements that allowed them to buy drugs at a discount as
long as they went to nursing homes only, according to the
indictment. The manufacturers included Bayer, Parke Davis and
Burroughs-Wellcome.
</P>
<P>
   In that time, the group spent at least $420,000 to realize
proceeds of at least $8.4 million from wholesalers in Ohio,
Florida, Kentucky, California, Nevada and Oregon, according to the
indictment.
</P>
<P>
   The Ferros, Swift and Staley said they were still sifting
through the indictment and their own financial records and were
uncertain what that $8.4 million figure represented.
</P>
<P>
   They also declined to discuss the core of the government's case
against them _ that is, that they broke agreements with
manufacturers by sending drugs meant for nursing homes to
wholesalers.
</P>
<P>
   Swift and Ferro Jr. said their testimony in the Civella case
should not be misconstrued. They said they never testified that
they were willing participants in an illegal scheme.
</P>
<P>
   Swift noted that he had been careful in 1991 not to say that any
diversion he had proposed was illegal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't (then), and it isn't (now),'' Swift said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their experience in the Civella case, they said they
could not understand how prosecutors could imagine that they had
committed criminal fraud through their discount pharmaceutical
operation.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is business, not crime, one defense lawyer argued.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think our clients have not violated any law and are simply
good businessmen who have worked hard and established themselves in
a business where they've found a method of making money,'' said
Bruce Houdek, who is representing Swift. ``There's no dishonesty at
all.''

EVOLUTION FUROR HARDLY AFFECTS MUSEUM IN HAYS, KAN. 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM FISHER  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star   HAYS, Kan. _ The Kansas Board of
Education's decision to excise almost any mention of evolution in
the state's science curriculum wasn't even a figurative blip on the
radar screen in a huge domed building that abuts Interstate 70
here.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The crowds have kept coming _ 80,000 visitors since mid-March,
with 15 percent from out of state or foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
   Boys and girls still stand open-mouthed on an upper level as
life-size models of a Tyrannosaurus rex and other beasts of
prehistory roar at them.
</P>
<P>
   Or others _ both young and old _ get up close and personal with
exhibits such as a 14-foot-long fish that died shortly after
swallowing whole its last meal. It subsequently became a fossil
with a perfectly formed, undigested 6-foot fossil fish inside it.
</P>
<P>
   The state board's vote Aug. 11 in Topeka may have downplayed the
theories of Charles Darwin, but at the Sternberg Museum of Natural
History people are voting with their dollars ($4 for adults, $2 for
seniors and children) to view a world-famous paleontology
collection.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it (the vote) will make a bit of difference to
us,'' said Jerry Choate, director of the $10 million museum, which
opened in the spring after years in cramped quarters at Fort Hays
State University.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those interested in what we have will come. Those who think
differently wouldn't have come anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   What some now see as the gulf between evolution and creationism
was not a problem for Charles H. Sternberg, patriarch of the
renowned family of paleontologists (Charles M., George F., and
Levi). The new museum is named for the father and his son.
</P>
<P>
   One has only to go back to the spring of 1876 as Sternberg
searched the Cretaceous chalk beds 70 miles west of Hays for
fossils, then objects of a frenzied quest by museums that was akin
to the wildest gold fevers that had consumed California or
Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Sternberg was 26, grandson of a theologian, son of a teacher and
suffering malaria. One day, he wrote in his autobiography, The Life
of a Fossil Hunter, he came upon the remains of a mosasaur, a
12-foot-long amphibious lizard with an articulated jaw like a
modern-day snake. The beast prowled the waters of the great inland
sea that 80 million years ago covered most of the Great Plains and
central Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Sternberg recalled:
</P>
<P>
   ``(It had) an additional set of articulations in the backbone
that allowed it to coil. Its head lay in the center with the column
around it, and the four paddles stretched out on either side. It
was covered by only a few inches of disintegrated chalk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forgetting my sickness, I shouted to the surrounding
wilderness, `Thank God! Thank God!' And I did well to thank the
Creator, as I slowly brushed away the powdered chalk and revealed
the beauties of this reptile of the Age of Reptiles.''
</P>
<P>
   Sternberg's long-ago gratitude to a higher power takes on an odd
ambiguity in mid-1999. Consider:
</P>
<P>
   - All around Hays, a good part of the prehistory of the earth
can be read through fossils. From here came (and still comes) not
only the spectacular mounted specimens in museums that have caused
a child's eyes to go wide but also the delicate impressions left by
the ferns and sassafras _ what Sternberg described ``as perfect as
if a Divine hand had stamped them in yielding wax.''
</P>
<P>
   - More than ancient leaves and old, monstrous bones, the buried
secrets of this part of Kansas bequeathed a far greater legacy _
modern science.
</P>
<P>
   Rudolph A. Raff, director of the University of Indiana's
Institute for Molecular and Cellular Biology and author of the
forward to Sternberg's reprinted autobiography, said that the West
of the late 19th century was more than cattlemen and pioneers,
Indians and buffalo, railroads and shootouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The West was an invitation to scientific discovery on a scale
that today can scarcely be imagined,'' wrote Raff. ``Some of the
fossil finds from the West were to play important roles in
providing evidence in favor of evolution. A whole series of fossils
illustrating the evolution of horses is a notable example.''
</P>
<P>
   - Yet fossils and their connection to evolution were only part
of the story. More importantly, contended Raff, modern American
scientific methodology was born amid the paleontological rush. Digs
like those of Sternberg and his contemporaries mandated what then
were revolutionary disciplines _ verification, attention to detail,
peer review and patience.
</P>
<P>
   Choate said he thought the whole creation-evolution controversy
was a flash in the pan. Kansans, he said, would react to the
national publicity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Give it two years, and I don't think it'll be an issue,'' said
Choate.
</P>
<P>
   And Choate has other fish to fry anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem now is getting more signs out on the interstate,''
he said. ``Our audience is kids in the back seats of cars who want
to see dinosaurs and other things that look really weird.''
</P>
<P>
   Beside the live-action dinosaurs (activated by hidden motion
sensors), the museum has tunnels that lead into a diorama of Kansas
and Colorado's inland sea and then to its sandy shores, places
inhabited with sharks with heads as big as Buick front ends and
carnivorous birds with stupendous wingspans.
</P>
<P>
   There are interactive computer stations, study rooms, and books,
slides, videos and other educational materials.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids go crazy over this place,'' said Choate. ``But then, so
do their parents. There's nothing quite like it anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Greg H. Farley, an assistant professor of biology at Fort Hays
State, was less sanguine about the vote in Topeka.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can you teach without evolution? In fact, how can we teach
extinction _ which is a definite possibility _ if we can't teach
evolution?
</P>
<P>
   ``For instance, today we've got a man-eating bacteria now that
literally consumes flesh. No antibiotic works. The same is true of
a new strain of E-coli. Those bacteria evolved to become resistant
over just a few years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Evolution isn't just men from apes. It's new breeds of wheat.
It's better peas. It's looking a specimens here at Sternberg and
being able to see how, say, hip joints of animals have changed over
millions of years.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Hays School District itself says it will make no
changes in response to the school board decision and will continue
to teach the theory of evolution.
</P>
<P>
   Darci Zweygardt, who drove her children the 150 miles from St.
Francis, stood under the skeleton of a huge mastodon near the
entrance. Yes, she had heard of the controversy. She said she'd
tried to keep an open mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you know,'' she said, waving a hand at exhibits that
showed the western Kansas of 80,000 millenniums ago, ``it's pretty
hard to just ignore all this.''
</P>
<P>
   Sternberg, who died at age 93 in 1943, never saw the dichotomy
between fossils and faith. Near the end of his autobiography, he
wrote this:
</P>
<P>
   ``How wonderful are the works of an Almighty hand! The life that
is now, how small a fraction of the life that has been! Miles of
strata, mountain high, are but the stony sepulchers of the life of
the past.''

SMOKE BOMBS IN MERRIAM, KAN., THEATER PROBABLY LINKED TO OTHER
ATTACKS, FBI SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 by MARK MORRIS  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The smoke bombing
of a Merriam, Kan., movie theater Friday probably is related to
about a dozen similar incidents elsewhere in the country and is
being investigated as a terrorist incident, an FBI spokesman said
Saturday.
<TEXT>
<P>
   About 1,000 people were evacuated from the 20-screen Cinemark
theater complex about 7:30 p.m. after someone ignited two crude
smoke bombs that emitted noxious fumes _ possibly chlorine gas _ in
and near one theater.
</P>
<P>
   FBI spokesman Jeff Lanza said the bombs consisted of two
20-ounce drink cups that had been filed with chemicals and then set
on fire.
</P>
<P>
   Lanza said one was found under seats near the front of the
theater and the second was found in a trash can just outside the
theater doors. The bombs were not designed to explode and no one
was injured.
</P>
<P>
   Lanza said the technique and the bombs resembled those found
over the last couple of months at theaters in Dallas; Chicago;
Joliet, Ill.; and in Ohio, Kentucky, Indiana and Wisconsin. Similar
devices also were found at Cinemark corporate offices in Plano,
Texas and at some theaters owned by Kansas City's AMC Entertainment
Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The bombers) have some issues with the theaters,'' Lanza
said. ``We're drawing that conclusion based on the similarities of
the crimes. We're looking at this as a terrorist incident at this
point.''
</P>
<P>
   Brenda Nolte, spokeswoman for AMC Entertainment Inc., said she
wasn't aware of any incidents at AMC theaters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have received hollow threats from time to time. ... None of
the threats have been attributed to a single group,'' she said. A
Cinemark spokesman could not be reached for comment Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Lanza said the bombers seem to be focusing on newer multiplex
theaters. He said he knew of no serious injuries at other theaters.
</P>
<P>
   Two employees of the Merriam movie complex were treated at a
hospital after they inhaled the fumes, and they were quickly
released, said Cpl. Dan Kellerman of the Merriam Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   Lanza said four members of the FBI's local domestic terrorism
squad were investigating the incident Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   No one had called or left a note claiming responsibility for the
smoke bombing by Saturday afternoon, Lanza and Kellerman said.

FIRST LADY PLANS NEW CAMPAIGN TACTICS  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Hillary Rodham Clinton will inaugurate a new phase of
her exploratory campaign for the U.S. Senate after Labor Day,
breaking from her schedule of listening forums to add other events,
such as street walks and visits to centers for the elderly, the
first lady's associates said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Her associates said the expanded schedule did not mean that Mrs.
Clinton was abandoning her so-called listening forums, which have
been the mainstay of her New York visits this summer.
</P>
<P>
   But they said that her new schedule would include the kind of
less-controlled events that are more typical of full-fledged
campaigns but which have been notably absent from the first lady's
travels to date.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's listening tours had, as a political device, been
intended to present her as a curious but constant visitor trying to
learn about a state where she has never lived, but one that she
would like to represent in the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The listening events had some degree of spontaneity _ the first
lady's staff did not control the audience _ but as political
events, they tended to be safe.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, Mrs. Clinton discussed an issue, such as health care
or child care, of particular concern to women voters, who are
likely to be key to this election.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady's friends described her Saturday as enjoying the
listening events and being satisfied with their political result.

REAL ESTATE: HOLDING A HOUSE HOSTAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., N.J., Conn.)  (js) 
 By JAY ROMANO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It may seem outrageous, but it is possible for someone you had
no contractual relationship with _ indeed, someone you have never
even met _ to file a lien on your property that would make it
impossible for you to sell your house, mortgage it or refinance an
existing mortgage on it.
</P>
<P>
   The document is called a mechanic's lien and it could set you
back thousands of dollars in legal fees to get the party filing the
document off your back.
</P>
<P>
   ``A mechanic's lien carries with it very substantial power,''
said Gerald Zisholtz, a real estate lawyer in Mineola, N.Y. ``It's
like a bank mortgage, and an unfriendly one at that.''
</P>
<P>
   Zisholtz explained that a mechanic's lien is an encumbrance
against a property that can be filed by just about anyone who has
provided services or materials at the property. And as long as the
lien is on the property, he said, the owner is essentially held
hostage by the person who filed it.
</P>
<P>
   What action to take is the immediate problem. The homeowner may
already have paid his general contractor, but have no way to know
whether the subcontractor who has filed the mechanic's lien was
paid by the general contractor. If the homeowner has a record of
having paid the general contractor in full, that will constitute an
absolute defense in a legal proceeding between the subcontractor
and the home owner.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, the homeowner is well-advised to consult a lawyer,
because one way or another, the homeowner must get the lien
removed. One option may be for the property owner to pay the
subcontractor the amount of the lien, and then deduct that amount
from future payments due the general contractor. Another
possibility, usable when the lien is filed by the general
contractor, would be for the property owner to post a bond for the
amount of the lien, and then resolve the issue of who owes whom
through litigation.
</P>
<P>
   One common way homeowners end up on the wrong end of a
mechanic's lien, he said, occurs when they enter into a contract
for a major home-improvement project. In most cases, Zisholtz said,
the general contractor will then ``sub out'' portions of the job _
plumbing and electrical work, for example _ to subcontractors. The
general contractor and subcontractors will then purchase supplies
and materials.
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, Zisholtz said, the relationship between the
general contractor and the subcontractors and suppliers is not
obvious to the homeowner because the homeowner only deals with _
and is under contract to make payments to _ the general contractor.
It is the general contractor's responsibility, then, to make
payments to subcontractors and suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   On occasion, however, a general contractor will fail to make
those payments. And when that happens, Zisholtz said, the law gives
subcontractors and suppliers the right to file a mechanic's lien
against the property for the value of the services or supplies.
</P>
<P>
   But why should an owner be forced to pay a bill to a
subcontractor with whom he has no contractual relationship?
</P>
<P>
   ``Because the lien law charges the owner with a responsibility
to pay a subcontractor whose labor and materials are being used to
enhance the value of the owner's property,'' Zisholtz said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Under current law, he said, a contractor, subcontractor or
supplier has a limited amount of time in which to file a mechanic's
lien. For one-family houses, he said, the lien must be filed within
four months after the work was performed or material was delivered
to the job. For other properties the lien must be filed within
eight months.
</P>
<P>
   Zisholtz said a mechanic's lien automatically expires after one
year unless it is renewed. Moreover, he said, the person filing the
lien must notify the property owner within 30 days after filing and
must file proof of that notification within within 35 days after
filing.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't dot your i's and cross your t's, the lien may
fail,'' Zisholtz said, adding that the best defense to a mechanic's
lien is having made payment in full to the general contractor or to
the person who has filed the lien.
</P>
<P>
   If the property owner does not have an adequate defense against
a properly filed valid lien, the law gives the person who filed the
lien the right to start a foreclosure action against the property.
</P>
<P>
   In New Jersey, the rules governing mechanic's liens are somewhat
different from those in New York. Richard M. Baron, a Hackensack
lawyer who helped draft New Jersey's lien law, said that while
contractors, subcontractors and suppliers can file liens for the
same general reasons that liens can be filed in New York, the
procedure for doing so is different.
</P>
<P>
   Baron said that mechanic's liens _ or construction liens, as
they are referred to in New Jersey _ can only be filed when there
is a written contract between a homeowner and a contractor. In New
York, he said, liens can be filed even when the agreement between a
contractor and a homeowner is oral.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, he said, liens in New Jersey must be filed within 90
days of completion of the work or delivery of material to the
property. For residential properties, he said, the filing of the
lien must be preceded by the delivery of a special form to the
owner bearing the amount of the claim. The contractor must also ask
the homeowner to submit the matter to arbitration or to another
form of dispute resolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``The purpose of that is to get the homeowner and the claimant
together to see if they can sort out the dispute without ending up
with an encumbrance on the property,'' Baron said.
</P>
<P>
   If arbitration takes place, he said, the contractor can only
file a lien in accordance with the arbitrator's decision. If the
homeowner ignores the demand for arbitration, the contractor must
still petition the arbitrator for a decision allowing the
contractor to file the lien. In such cases, Baron said, the
arbitrator will generally permit a lien for the full amount
requested by the contractor.
</P>
<P>
   Another difference between New York and New Jersey, Baron said,
is that while New York liens can be renewed every year, New Jersey
construction liens automatically expire if the contractor has not
started a foreclosure action within one year of the filing of the
lien.
</P>
<P>
   In Connecticut, the laws on mechanic's liens are essentially a
blend of New York and New Jersey laws.
</P>
<P>
   William Selsberg, a Stamford real estate lawyer, said that as in
New Jersey, contractors in Connecticut must file their liens within
90 days of performing work or delivering supplies to the property.
Moreover, he said, such liens automatically expire one year after
filing. At the same time, however, there is no requirement in
Connecticut that there be a written contract for a contractor to
file a mechanic's lien, and no requirement that the contractor
first make a demand for payment or arbitration.
</P>
<P>
   Homeowners should make sure they do whatever is necessary to
protect themselves, Selsberg said. For example, he said, if a lien
has been filed by a subcontractor, a property owner should
discontinue payments to the general contractor until the
subcontractor's lien has been resolved. And if the time period for
the filing of the lien has expired, he said, the homeowner should
make sure he or she doesn't inadvertently reopen it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do not let a contractor back into the house if the period for
filing has expired,'' he said. ``Unscrupulous contractors will
always find some sham reason to go back and do additional work just
to start a new 90-day period running.''

   LOS ANGELES _ He's a running back who transferred to Cal State
Northridge after three years at a DivisionI football program. He's
not that tall but he carries a wide load. And he's wearing No.6.
</P>
<P>
   DeJuan Gilmore, a senior who came to CSUN from Washington State,
isn't Melvin Blue, even though he's wearing Blue's number from
1998. He did put on a good display of speed and power in Saturday's
scrimmage at North Campus Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Gilmore broke off a 40-yard run on his first carry and also
muscled into the end zone from 1 yard later in the scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   ``When your first run is a long run,'' Gilmore said, ``that
gives you a lot of confidence for the rest of the day.''
</P>
<P>
   Gilmore, who is listed at 5-foot-8 and 204 pounds, had a strong
day despite not being in shape. He's carrying what looks like 15-20
extra pounds, and Gilmore has actually slimmed down from the start
of fall camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a little chubby, but my legs are still strong,'' he said.
``I try to run hard all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   The Matadors are counting on Gilmore to complement fullback
Jaumal Bradley, a senior first-team All-Big Sky Conference
selection last year. That's a role Gilmore is happy to fill; he
isn't making any promises of a 3,000-yard season like the cocky
Blue did last year.
</P>
<P>
   Blue led an anemic CSUN rushing attack with only 476 yards.
Bradley, who rushed for 374 last season, reported to fall practice
leaner and faster than last year. After sitting out most of the
week with the flu, Bradley was on the field for 20 plays Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``All my blocks were crisp,'' Bradley said, adding he ran out of
gas on his last carry, which he fumbled. ``I didn't have anything
to finish the run, no pop.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Kearin, CSUN's interim head coach, was enthusiastic about
the combination of Gilmore and Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ran the ball really well,'' he said. ``DeJuan had a big
day. We have two physically superior running backs.''
</P>
<P>
   Wham, bam, boom: Wide receiver Terrence Jones, a senior transfer
from Fresno State, scored the first of the offense's four
touchdowns Saturday when he took a 10-yard pass from quarterback
Marcus Brady and sprinted 50 yards down the sideline, past a
shocked defense.
</P>
<P>
   But Jones (5-11, 180) made an impression with three crushing
downfield blocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a big statement to make,'' Jones said. ``If I have to
block the whole game ... I'll do whatever the coach asks me to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   The flip side: Two negatives from the scrimmage: An injury to
redshirt freshman Isaac Gardner and several holding penalties.
</P>
<P>
   Gardner separated his shoulder while trying to tackle Gilmore
during the third possession. The seriousness of the injury isn't
known.
</P>
<P>
   Kearin wasn't pleased with the penalties.
</P>
<P>
   ``We held way too much, on both sides of the ball,'' Kearin
said. ``I was hoping the referees would be sticklers about it and
they were.''
</P>
<P>
   Taking a break: CSUN gets today off and resumes two-a-days
Monday morning. The coaching staff hopes to have a depth chart
completed by Monday, and the season opener is Sept. 4 at home
against Western Oregon.

DO POETIC SOULS LURK BEHIND THESE MINDS?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It appears that as much as we've overrated Raul
Mondesi the ballplayer, we've underrated Mondesi the essayist.
</P>
<P>
   I refer to a curious footnote to the outfielder's recent obscene
diatribe against the Dodgers' manager and general manager _ the
four-sentence apology issued in his name the next day by the front
office.
</P>
<P>
   For an athlete, Mondesi displayed surprising polish in his
session at the typewriter, batting out a statement of uncommon
succinctness and grace.
</P>
<P>
   A minor grammatical lapse (he wrote ``importantly'' when
``important'' would have sufficed) was overshadowed by the easy
sophistication of the sentence that followed (``In what has been a
frustrating season, I let my emotions get the best of me'').
Mondesi, though little-schooled in the art of the English language,
showed a facility for Anglo-American idiom when he thanked fans who
``have stood behind me.''
</P>
<P>
   It must be concluded that Mondesi is a demon on deadline, seeing
that the statement had to be completed in time to be passed out to
Dodgers beat writers in Montreal in the hour or so between the end
of that afternoon's game and the team's departure for the airport.
</P>
<P>
   It is fair, of course, to speculate that he enjoyed the benefits
of a collaborator in the project. Maybe one of the Dodgers' college
products, Paul LoDuca or Trenidad Hubbard, helped with the actual
typing. Perhaps a member of the coaching staff, a Glenn Hoffman or
a Claude Osteen, performed the proofreading chores.
</P>
<P>
   Possibly someone other than Mondesi _ Devon White? Craig
Counsell? Jose Vizcaino? _ ghost-wrote a rough draft and Raul
imposed his style through aggressive editing later on.
</P>
<P>
   I hope the cynics are wrong when they suggest the apology was in
fact composed by Dodgers management and merely attributed to
Mondesi.
</P>
<P>
   It's my experience that putting words on paper often causes the
writer to learn more than the reader. The page is a mirror of the
mind. It forces the writer to confront the holes in his logic and
his soul. Mondesi needed the therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Many others in the world of sports could benefit from sitting
down at a typewriter, a word processor or a yellow legal pad and
writing a heartfelt apology. Based on the success of Mondesi's
literary debut, we can imagine the results if they did.
</P>
<P>
   Dear San Diego fans,
</P>
<P>
   If only a surgeon could stitch a broken spirit as surely as a
torn shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   I stand before you an aimless vessel of misspent passion, crying
out for a guiding light.
</P>
<P>
   After my latest misdemeanor, in which a harmless heckler was
forced to bear the verbal brunt of my self-induced frustration, I
would not blame this forgiving town if it cast aside all hope for
my redemption.
</P>
<P>
   I pray you do not abandon me, but instead accompany me on a
dusty journey to adulthood. Have faith that one sunny day you will
proudly say, ``I knew him when.'' &QL; 
A last thought: How fleeting is youth, how elusive maturity. &QL; 
Sincerely &QL; 
Ryan Leaf &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dear golf fans,
</P>
<P>
   Among our sport's endearing oddities: Many touring professionals
are multimillionaires, and individual earnings determine the season
standings, yet golfers are generally spared the ``greedy'' label
applied to other athletes. Ours is seen as a gentlemen's game
played for the love of it.
</P>
<P>
   We tarnished that cherished reputation by suggesting we should
be paid _ or our favorite charities should be paid _ when we
represent the United States in an international match. For this we
are profoundly sorry. &QL; 
With renewed patriotism, &QL; 
The U.S. Ryder Cup team &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dear Detroit fans,
</P>
<P>
   Once I clutched a football to my ribs, but now I tote the dead
weight of regret.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing my retirement last month, I was thinking only of
my own selfish desires. I realize now that the frustration of
playing for a losing franchise and the physical pain associated
with football are trivial compared to the aching knowledge one let
down one's teammates and public.
</P>
<P>
   I know now that putting off my decision until the eve of
training camp left the Lions without a running back or time to make
alternative plans. If the Lions lose again in '99, this time I am
to blame.
</P>
<P>
   Once I clutched a football to my ribs, only to fumble it on
immortality's goal line. &QL; 
Begging forgiveness, &QL; 
Barry Sanders &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To our physically challenged friends,
</P>
<P>
   It was an honor to get to know some of you during the
controversy that followed our indefensible misuse of the so-called
handicapped-parking placards. In many ways that count, you are
bigger, stronger, more complete people than we.
</P>
<P>
   Thank you for furthering our educations. &QL; 
Best wishes, &QL; 
The UCLA Eleven &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dear CSUN football fans,
</P>
<P>
   On the day I was fired as head football coach, I questioned the
competence and integrity of Cal State Northridge administrators.
This was unfair of me.
</P>
<P>
   I was unable then _ and am unable still _ to support my vague
accusations with facts. Until or unless I do, the administrators
deserve no disrespect and I deserve no leniency in the court of
public opinion.
</P>
<P>
   In what had been a frustrating time, I let my emotions get the
best of me. &QL; 
Yours truly, &QL; 
Ron Ponciano &QL;

POWERFUL HURRICANE HEADS TOWARD TEXAS COAST
<TEXT>

</P>
<P>
   SOUTH PADRE ISLAND _ Hurricane Bret churned north toward to the
Texas coast Saturday, packing winds of 135 miles per hour and
threatening to become one of the strongest storms ever to reach the
region.
</P>
<P>
   Though the tempest remained offshore about 165 miles southeast
of here, it continued to move north at about 14 miles per hour,
instead of drifting west as originally predicted.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, residents of this low coastal island fled the storm's
wrath amid wind gusts and rain squalls.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of shrimp boats streamed past the granite jetties of the
Brazos Santiago Pass to escape roiling gulf waters, and the only
causeway off this resort island was backed up with residents towing
smaller boats, vacation trailers and their belongings from Bret's
path.
</P>
<P>
   Late Saturday, officials extended a hurricane watch all the way
to Freeport, south of Houston. A hurricane warning was in effect
from Port O'Connor to the Mexican border.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now it looks like Corpus Christi is going to be the
major threatened area,'' said Matt Moreland, a meteorologist with
the National Weather Service's Houston/Galveston office. But
Moreland added that it ``still looks unlikely'' that the storm
could reach as far north as Galveston and Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is now a very serious, dangerous storm,'' added Moreland.
If Bret were to strike land at its current strength, ``it would be
along the lines of Carla or Andrew.''
</P>
<P>
   Carla ravaged Texas in 1961, and Andrew hit Miami in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Alicia, the most recent storm to hit the greater Houston area,
was listed as a category 3 storm when it hit in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   There is still the possibility that Bret could diminish before
hitting land, but officials said they consider that unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, it looks like it will make land as a Category 4
storm,'' said Moreland.
</P>
<P>
   The National Hurricane Center warns that Bret also could soak
coastal areas with 8 to 10 inches of rain _ or even more, depending
on the speed and the motion of the hurricane.
</P>
<P>
   With its powerful winds, Bret was upgraded late Saturday to a
category 4 storm on a scale of 1 to 5. Only 17 category 4
hurricanes have touched land in the United States over the last
century, and virtually all of them did catastrophic damage.
</P>
<P>
   The strong possibility remains that the storm could still turn
west, striking this southern tip of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   And all along the Rio Grande Valley, from Brownsville to
Mission, residents prepared for the storm by emptying grocery
stores, lumber yards, and hardware stores of emergency supplies,
and stood in long lines at water kiosks to lay in supplies in case
power is lost. Others, afraid their low-lying homes would not stand
the expected flooding, fled inland in a hastily-organized
evacuation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It caught us with our pants down, is what it did,'' said Matt
Moreau, owner of Pico Ace Hardware on South Padre Island as he
ordered employees to cover cash registers with garbage bags before
closing. The owner of the only lumber yard on the island said he
was out of plywood by 10:30 Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Panic has set in and everybody cleaned me out of plywood,
flashlights and hurricane materials and now we're battening down
the hatches and I'm getting out,'' said Moreau. ``I still have five
hours of boarding up on my house in Port Isabel, so I'm getting
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Cameron County Judge Gilberto Hinojosa arranged for
residents in flood-prone areas to leave the county after Red Cross
officials decided not to open any emergency shelters in the county.
Instead, buses from local school districts transported evacuees
inland to shelters in neighboring Hidalgo County.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going a 100 miles a hour, I'm trying to get my people out
of the county because it's going to be bad,'' predicted the county
judge, who said National Weather Service officials told him to
expect a direct hit later on today.
</P>
<P>
   ``It poses a severe threat,'' the judge said. ``We're looking at
conceivably the worst natural disaster Cameron County has had since
hurricane Beulah and when that happened, I was a freshman in high
school at Mission High. It's been a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   And as Hurricane Bret strengthened Saturday afternoon and
evening, island officials told residents it was time to get out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're ordering everyone to leave, I'd rather just be safe than
sorry,'' said town mayor Ed Cyganiewicz.``I'm not sure what it's
going to do, but they're still predicting it will have a drastic
effect on the island.''
</P>
<P>
   The causeway linking the island would be closed by 8 a.m., and
water and electric power shut off, the major said.
</P>
<P>
   Late summer guests at island hotels cleared out early, adding to
an orderly exodus from South Padre Island that by noon had cars
backed up to the middle of the causeway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ninety percent of the people have left the island, and most of
the homes are boarded up. People are taking it very seriously, but
there is no sense of panic,'' Cyganiewicz said.
</P>
<P>
   In Valley cities not directly along the coast, including
Harlingen, a number of residents boarded up homes on the seaward
side of their lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, we've lived through several of them, hurricanes Beulah
and Eric, and we've done pretty good so far but we're not taking
any chances,'' said Victor V. Garcia, as he nailed plywood over the
windows of his woodframe home at 1401 E. Taylor. He added: ``We'll
be ready if it does hit us directly and hopefully this old house
will be able to sustain what the hurricane brings.''
</P>
<P>
   Garcia and his wife, Arminda, had gassed up both cars, hauled in
extra drinking water and bought enough groceries to feed themselves
and the three grand children who live with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it hits, it's going to be a bad one because of the strength
it has,'' Arminda Garcia said. ``The kids are a little scared.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Valley natives expressed optimism Bret would mimic
Hurricane Allen, a deadly 1980 storm which roared across the
Caribbean Sea and into the Gulf on a collision course with the
Valley. But the storm stalled offshore of Brownsville, lost
considerable strength, and went inland farther north.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully we won't get it, but we have to be prepared. You
never know about hurricanes,'' commented Tadeo Cano, who was
waiting in a long line to purchase drinking water. ``They may stop
and go in another direction.
</P>
<P>
   South Padre Island officials, noting that most of the
construction is relatively new, did not anticipate ``mass
destruction of buildings.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll survive. We've planned for a long time and I think we're
ready,'' said mayor Cyganiewicz.
</P>
<P>
   The American Red Cross has already opened a shelter in Pharr,
near the Mexican border. The shelter has space for 4,000 people.
Three other shelters are also on standby, according to Margaret
O'Brien-Molina, head of communications for the Red Cross' Houston
office. Ten disaster specialists from the Houston office of the
American Red Cross took off for McAllen Saturday, prepared to help
with evacuations, shelter and other possible emergency needs.
Additional personnel and three food trucks are expected to head
south today.
</P>
<P>
   The trucks, each with a capability to provide a small meal to
2,000 people, have not yet received a specific destination.
</P>
<P>
   ``They will go where they are needed,'' said O'Brien-Molina.
</P>
<P>
   Unpredictable as hurricanes can be, O'Brien-Molina said the Red
Cross has begun planning for the remote possibility that the
hurricane might reach as far north as Galveston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was here for Alicia,'' she said, referring to the Hrricane
that hit in 1983. ``I don't even want to think about another.''

   ``Ninety percent of the people have left the island, and most of
the homes are boarded up. People are taking it very seriously, but
there is no sense of panic,'' Cyganiewicz said.
</P>
<P>
   In Valley cities not directly along the coast, including
Harlingen, a number of residents boarded up homes on the seaward
side of their lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, we've lived through several of them, hurricanes Beulah
and Eric, and we've done pretty good so far but we're not taking
any chances,'' said Victor V. Garcia, as he nailed plywood over the
windows of his woodframe home at 1401 E. Taylor. He added: ``We'll
be ready if it does hit us directly and hopefully this old house
will be able to sustain what the hurricane brings.''
</P>
<P>
   Garcia and his wife, Arminda, had gassed up both cars, hauled in
extra drinking water and bought enough groceries to feed themselves
and the three grand children who live with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it hits, it's going to be a bad one because of the strength
it has,'' Arminda Garcia said. ``The kids are a little scared.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Valley natives expressed optimism Bret would mimic
Hurricane Allen, a deadly 1980 storm which roared across the
Caribbean Sea and into the Gulf on a collision course with the
Valley. But the storm stalled offshore of Brownsville, lost
considerable strength, and went inland farther north.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully we won't get it, but we have to be prepared. You
never know about hurricanes,'' commented Tadeo Cano, who was
waiting in a long line to purchase drinking water. ``They may stop
and go in another direction.
</P>
<P>
   South Padre Island officials, noting that most of the
construction is relatively new, did not anticipate ``mass
destruction of buildings.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll survive. We've planned for a long time and I think we're
ready,'' said mayor Cyganiewicz.
</P>
<P>
   The American Red Cross has already opened a shelter in Pharr,
near the Mexican border. The shelter has space for 4,000 people.
Three other shelters are also on standby, according to Margaret
O'Brien-Molina, head of communications for the Red Cross' Houston
office. Ten disaster specialists from the Houston office of the
American Red Cross took off for McAllen Saturday, prepared to help
with evacuations, shelter and other possible emergency needs.
Additional personnel and three food trucks are expected to head
south today.
</P>
<P>
   The trucks, each with a capability to provide a small meal to
2,000 people, have not yet received a specific destination.
</P>
<P>
   ``They will go where they are needed,'' said O'Brien-Molina.
</P>
<P>
   Unpredictable as hurricanes can be, O'Brien-Molina said the Red
Cross has begun planning for the remote possibility that the
hurricane might reach as far north as Galveston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was here for Alicia,'' she said, referring to the Hurricane
that hit in 1983. ``I don't even want to think about another.''

SCHILLING OUT FOR SEASON?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Fixing fifth graph, indicating Rockies GM Gebhard resigned
Friday) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Curt Schilling is eligible to come off the
disabled list Monday, but it is not out of the question he could be
finished for the season, especially after the Philadelphia Phillies
dropped nine of 12 to fall out of the wild-card race.
</P>
<P>
   There are several theories why Schilling broke down when the
Phillies needed him most, but overwork tops the list. During the
past four seasons, Schilling, who had major shoulder surgery in
1995, has thrown 38 complete games, including five straight in May.
That is 14 more than anyone else in baseball. (Randy Johnson is
next with 24).
</P>
<P>
   During the past three years, he has thrown 10,722 pitches. No
other pitcher is within 500 pitches of that total.
</P>
<P>
   When he recorded back-to-back 300-strikeout seasons in 1997 and
1998, Schilling pitched 523 innings. No one else pitched 500.
</P>
<P>
   Out of a job: Published reports said Colorado Rockies GM Bob
Gebhard would be fired last Monday. He ended up resigning Friday.
The strange thing was the story first came out Monday in the Denver
Post when former Rockies manager Don Baylor was in town as batting
coach with Atlanta. Baylor was fired last fall after owner Jerry
McMorris had to decide between the manager and the GM. Gebhard
stayed, but was gone this week. ``He called the shots,'' Baylor
said. ``I've taken my fall.'' Baylor is expected to surface next
season in either Anaheim or Baltimore. And it comes at a time when
baseball is under fire for not hiring more minorities. Only two of
11 minority managers hired ever got a second chance. ``If that's
racist, I don't know,'' Baylor said. ``The hiring practices haven't
been very good lately.''
</P>
<P>
   Going out on top: Left-hander Brian Anderson, who Arizona was
ready to trade this spring, was 5-1, 5.02 in 15 starts while taking
Todd Stottlemyre's spot in the rotation. Tuesday, Anderson pitched
his second career shutout, a 4-0 three-hitter against the Cubs, in
what likely will be his last start of the season. He will be used
in long relief as the D'backs stay with 12 pitchers and will step
in if any trouble develops with Stottlemyre, who returned Friday.
``All I could do was pitch today,'' Anderson said after the
victory. ``Everybody knew this was my last start. I can do the
math. I just wanted to go out and give it my best effort.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Clutch: Javy Lopez's season-ending knee surgery has robbed
Atlanta's lineup of one of the club's best clutch hitters. Lopez's
absence has been felt most in the late innings with the game on the
line. The Braves' .262 average with runners in scoring position is
only 11th-best in the league. With men in scoring position and two
outs, their average is .234, ranking them 15th among 16 teams.
Lopez's average was .296 with runners in scoring position and an
astounding .333 with runners in scoring position and two outs. His
replacement, Eddie Perez, is hitting .184 with runners in scoring
position and .091 with runners in scoring position and two outs.
</P>
<P>
   Muscle man: A year ago at this time, Dale Sveum was warming up
the pitchers in the bullpen for the New York Yankees, having been
released by the team a few weeks earlier. Wednesday, the
35-year-old utility player batted cleanup and started at first base
for Pittsburgh. Sveum not only hit his first two homers of the
season, he became the second player in franchise history to homer
from each side of the plate in the same game. The only other
Pirates player to do it is Bobby Bonilla, who did it twice. Sveum,
who played for the Pirates in 1996-97, signed a minor-league
contract with the team in May. He was called up July 24 but entered
the game batting just .172.

GEENA DAVIS' BID FOR THE OLYMPICS FALLS SHORT  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BLOOMFIELD, N.J. _ As an Oscar award-winning actress, Geena
Davis knew that someday her secret passion for archery would be
exposed. But in her first two years of competition, the news media
throng never came, and Davis began to treasure the thought that
maybe she would be allowed to compete as the rest of America's
archers do: in peace, in quiet and in anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   But that notion ended Saturday when news media members from more
than 50 outlets worldwide converged on a wet and dreary Brookdale
Park to watch Davis shoot arrows in the semifinals of the U.S.
Olympic Trials. Joining the dozens of local media members were
reporters from the British Broadcasting Company, the London Times,
RTL television in Germany and a newspaper in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   The 60 male and female archers, who, despite being the nation's
best in their field, are accustomed to performing before
single-digit crowds and had not experienced such a media frenzy.
And neither had Davis, who, despite her renown as an actress, was
not ready for such attention as an athlete.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was ill prepared for this onslaught,'' Davis said after
seven hours of competition. ``It was like being at a premiere,
which I'm used to. I mean, that doesn't make me nervous anymore.
But to do a sport with this kind of attention was kind of
unsettling. And also, one wants to do well at the Olympic Trials,
so there was a level of stress.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis, who won an Oscar for best supporting actress in the 1988
film ``The Accidental Tourist,'' laughed and smiled as she spoke.
Despite her anxiety about being in the spotlight, she admitted to
being pleased with her performance.
</P>
<P>
   Her 24th place finish in the field of 28 women was not enough to
get her into Sunday's second round, but it was nevertheless
exceptional for someone who, after becoming enthralled with the
sport while watching the 1996 Olympics, began shooting for the
first time in the spring of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's come farther in two years than most people would in five
or six years,'' said Janet Barrs, a fellow competitor from Salt
Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Scavotto, a 17-year-old soon-to-be senior at Enfield High
School in Connecticut, ended the day in first place with 1,287
points, 205 more than Davis. Jessica Carlson, 22, was second with
1,279 points, and Denise Parker was third with 1,255.
</P>
<P>
   The top three men's finishers were the two-time world champion
Vic Wunderle (1,335 points), the 1996 two-time gold medalist Justin
Huish (1,378) and the two-time Olympian Butch Johnson (1,312). The
top 16 finishers in each division will continue on in the
round-robin competition.
</P>
<P>
   While Davis views the serenity that surrounds most archery
events as a nice and welcomed respite from the raucous world of
Hollywood, her counterparts would rather have a little publicity.
So they appreciated the media coverage and also the roughly 50 fans
who showed up _ many because of Davis _ to watch in the pouring
rain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like when people come out to see me shoot,'' Scavotto said.
``I think it's great that the media is here. Archery doesn't get
much publicity and I think it's great that Geena is bringing more
popularity to the sport.''
</P>
<P>
   Dereck Chiu, Ketaki Chakracarti and Jennifer Lee, all recent
graduates of Bloomfield High School, were among the spectators who
took in their first archery event Saturday because of Davis. Huge
fans of Davis', particularly of her performance as a female
baseball player in ``A League of Their Own,'' they braved the
inclement weather to get a peek at her.
</P>
<P>
   Davis does not claim to be very athletic. She competed in only
track and field in high school, and said that it is easy to look
like a sportsman in Hollywood. But archery is as much a mental
challenge as it is a physical one, and it is the cerebral demands
of the sport that Davis finds most enjoyable.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's the challenge of trying to perfect something that
you're doing over and over again,'' said Davis, who like the rest
of the competitors shot 144 arrows Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Since becoming a student of her coach, Dan Rabska, more than two
years ago, Davis has trained six days a week, five hours a day. She
lifts weights, mainly focusing on the legs for stability when
aiming at the target, and jogs for stamina.
</P>
<P>
   For the mental aspects of the competition, she practices
visualization techniques for 20 to 30 minutes every day. In
addition to envisioning herself hitting the bull's eye, Davis also
tries to visualize ignoring any archers or reporters who may be in
the vicinity. Of course, she came up short Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very nervous,'' Davis said. ``It was incredibly
challenging and not something I could prepare for. I tried to
visualize what it would be like, but ...
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been wonderful that for two years, I've been able to
pursue this in my own little bubble. It's just been my private
thing that I've been doing and was able to work on in a fishbowl.
It's been really fun.''

BENNETT SHARPENS GAME, SPARKLES IN SCRIMMAGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Junior quarterback Drew Bennett spent much of the
week throwing floaters, but he had his game arm Saturday in a
90-minute scrimmage at Spaulding Field dominated by the defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had more to think about than throwing spirals, and I think
that took my mind off it,'' said Bennett, who completed 4 of 5
passes for 50 yards and directed the only scoring drive. ``I
worried about throwing it hard, rather than how it looks.''
</P>
<P>
   Freshman quarterback Cory Paus completed 5 of 9 passes for 55
yards. Sophomore Scott McEwan was 2 of 6 for 45 yards, and freshman
Ryan McCann, who suffered a concussion, completed 2 of 4 passes for
9 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett and Paus are expected to survive this weekend's
quarterback cuts and spend two weeks competing for the starting
job.
</P>
<P>
   ``The scrimmage was part of the whole (eight) days,'' UCLA coach
Bob Toledo said. ``We've been evaluating them through training
camp, and this was another part of the evaluation process.''
</P>
<P>
   Making the cuts: Toledo and offensive coordinator Al Borges will
gather in the coaches' room this morning and spend the day
evaluating each quarterback's performance in 14 practices.
</P>
<P>
   They'll consider composure under pressure, frequency of scoring
drives, ability to read blitzes, playmaking and grasp of the
offense. But the most important factor will be completion
percentage, since UCLA's passing game is based on short- and
middle-distance throws.
</P>
<P>
   Borges has tracked every pass thrown against both the first- and
second-team defenses. He has a statistical analysis of each
quarterback in one-on-one drills (receiver-against-cornerback),
seven-on-seven situations (no linemen) and the scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everytime you involve more players in a drill, the evaluation
becomes more important,'' Borges said. ``Seven-on-seven tests
decision-making, and 11-on-11 is really important. It counts double
the others.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Toledo will meet with the quarterbacks and announce the
finalists.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'll be able to sleep tonight,'' Bennett said, ``and
not say I wish I had done better.''
</P>
<P>
   Scrimmage notes: The standout performers were tailback DeShaun
Foster, who scored the lone touchdown, receiver Brian Poli-Dixon
and three freshmen: cornerback Ricky Manning and linebackers Asi
Faoa and Marcus Reese.
</P>
<P>
   Receiver Danny Farmer (ankle) and safety Jason Stephens (knee)
suffered mild sprains and may miss a few days. Otherwise, the
Bruins survived the first week of training camp with no significant
injuries to their top players.
</P>
<P>
   Gaining ground: Sophomore Devon Reese, a walk-on from Palmdale,
is contending for the fifth spot in the receiver rotation behind
Poli-Dixon, Farmer, Brad Melsby and Freddie Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reese blocks well, he catches well, and he's on a lot of
special teams,'' Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
   It's a subtle but significant development. Toledo wants to
redshirt Jon Dubravac, who played sparingly last year, but he can't
do it unless someone emerges as a reliable No. 5 receiver. Reese's
competition is Ryan Wilkins and Saugus' Cody Joyce, who is out with
an infected foot.

McCULLOUGH IMPRESSIVE AMID ALL THE PENALTIES 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVINE, Calif. _ It's a new season, but USC's first official
scrimmage Saturday proved the Trojans still have a nagging problem
from last year: penalties.
</P>
<P>
   During Saturday's 94-play scrimmage at UC Irvine, the Trojans
were penalized 15 times.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something that just plagued us,'' USC quarterback Carson
Palmer said. ``I think it had to do with being the first scrimmage.
It's the first time we had a big crowd and a game situation.''
</P>
<P>
   It was reminiscent of last season, when USC was penalized 126
times for 1,119 yards in 13 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just killed us. It really cost us a game or two last
year,'' USC coach Paul Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   You might think Hackett would be distressed over the penalties,
but he was fairly relaxed when assessing the number of mistakes
made.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a very spirited and emotional bunch,'' Hackett said.
``How much was necessary and how much was over-zealousness? That's
why we have the tape.''
</P>
<P>
   As for scrimmage highlights, freshman tailback Sultan McCullough
gained 88 yards in 29 carries and scored on 1- and 2-yard runs.
</P>
<P>
   McCullough was given so many carries because starter Chad Morton
played sparingly in order to rest his hamstring, while Frank Strong
(bruised thigh) and Malaefou MacKenzie (hamstring) did not play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't care (about the carries),'' McCullough said.
``I was just trying to do my thing. I'm just trying to get in
shape.''
</P>
<P>
   McCullough strained his hamstring at the NCAA Track
Championships in June. He is now one of several candidates to
replace Petros Papadakis as USC's No.2 tailback, after Papadakis
broke his foot in Friday's practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not scared. I'll do whatever I've got to do,'' McCullough
said. ``I can get to the end zone.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmer completed 11 of 15 passes for 135 yards, including a
65-yard scoring pass to R. Jay Soward. Mike Van Raaphorst completed
6 of 7 passes for 69 yards while John Fox completed 6 of 10 for 54
yards, including a 28-yard touchdown to freshman tight end Chad
Cook.
</P>
<P>
   Kicker David Bell missed 51- and 47-yard field-goal attempts.
</P>
<P>
   Surprise performance: True freshman safety Troy Polamalu was a
defensive star with eight tackles, two forced fumbles and 14-yard
touchdown run after stripping the ball from Jabari Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to redshirt at all,'' Polamalu said. ``I hope I
can play. I don't really care where the coaches put me.''
</P>
<P>
   Hackett said Polamalu, the nephew of former USC fullback Kennedy
Pola, was ``outstanding'' but that no decisions have been made on a
redshirt season.
</P>
<P>
   Sore arm: Palmer skipped Saturday morning's practice to rest his
arm, which has been sore because he and Van Raaphorst are USC's
only scholarship quarterbacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``My arm's been worn out,'' Palmer said.
</P>
<P>
   Injury update: Defensive tackle Bernard Riley and offensive
lineman Trevor Roberts sprained their ankles and will be out at
least a week.
</P>
<P>
   Offensive tackle Brent McCaffrey left the scrimmage early with
sore ribs, while wide receiver Windrell Hayes had a slightly
sprained ankle. Missing the scrimmage entirely was wide receiver
Marcell Allmond (hamstring).
</P>
<P>
   Hackett said none of those injuries were serious. Papadakis will
probably have foot surgery by midweek. Hackett said there is a
chance USC would appeal to the NCAA for a sixth year of eligibility
for Papadakis.

<P>
   &UR; UNRAVELLING &LR;  By Elizabeth Graver. Harvest/Harcourt Brace, $13.
Aimee Slater is a nave New Hampshire farm girl who leaves home for
a factory job in the 1840s, becomes impregnated by a mechanic and
is exiled by her mother, which forces her to build a new life as an
outcast and struggle to overcome her bitterness. In 1997 in The New
York Times Book Review, Benjamin DeMott called this a ``grave,
winter-wise and absorbing first novel.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TITAN: THE LIFE OF JOHN D. ROCKEFELLER, SR. &LR;  By Ron Chernow.
Vintage, $16. The archcapitalist John D. Rockefeller Sr.
(1839-1937) is portrayed as a complex figure whose lifelong
devotion to making money was balanced by a deep religious
conviction and devotion to his family. Rockefeller's Marxist
analysis of the U.S. economy put him and his fledgling company,
Standard Oil, in ruthless pursuit of monopoly on an unparalleled
scale before he was 30. This evenhanded account, selected as one of
the best books of 1998 by the editors of The New York Times Book
Review, ``is a triumph of the art of biography,'' Jack Beatty
wrote. ``Unflaggingly interesting,'' it brings its subject to life
``through sustained narrative portraiture of the large-scale,
19th-century kind.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SUMMER AT GAGLOW &LR;  By Esther Freud. Ecco, $15. Shifting back and
forth between contemporary London and Germany during and after
World War I, this novel explores the fracturing of a Jewish family
and how their notion of ``home'' is altered by their connection to
their former summer estate. The result is ``a near-seamless meshing
of family feeling, history and imagination,'' Deborah Mason wrote
last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE CLIMB: TRAGIC AMBITIONS ON EVEREST &LR;  By Anatoli Boukreev and
G. Weston DeWalt. St. Martin's Griffin, $13.95. This haunting
account of the 1996 storm that killed eight climbers from several
groups focuses on the role played by the driven Russian guide for
one of the teams, who saved three lives (and who died in an
avalanche the following year). In 1997 the reviewer Michael Parfit,
called the book ``raw but powerful.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; I MAY BE SOME TIME: ICE AND THE ENGLISH IMAGINATION &LR; , by
Francis Spufford (Picador USA, $15), is a history of Arctic and
Antarctic exploration centering on the exploits of great British
adventurers like Robert Falcon Scott and James Cook. ``With his
book, just as with the endeavors of the polar pioneers, the journey
might be worth it for its own sake,'' Robert R. Harris wrote last
year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE UNDISCOVERED COUNTRY &LR;  By Samantha Gillison. Owl/Holt, $13.
In this first novel, an American researcher takes his wife and
young daughter to a remote village in Papua New Guinea, where their
fragile family unit is tested after the girl joins the local
culture, escaping more and more often into the rain forest. The
result is an ``exceptional story,'' Elizabeth Gaffney wrote last
year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE SPANISH INQUISITION: A HISTORICAL REVISION &LR;  By Henry Kamen.
Yale University, $15.95. The author argues that the popular image
of the Inquisition as a barbaric, all-powerful scourge is a
19th-century myth, and that the tribunal was actually weak and its
methods more humane than those of most secular courts. Last year
the reviewer Richard L. Kagan called this ``the best general book''
on the subject ``both for its range and its depth of information.''
</P>
<P>
   The same publisher has reissued  &UR; PHILIP OF SPAIN &LR;  ($17.95),
Kamen's biography of Philip II, who reigned during the Inquisition
in the 16th century and who is often portrayed as an intolerant
religious zealot. In presenting the monarch instead as a cultured
Renaissance prince, this nuanced portrait is ``a fine
achievement,'' Hugh Thomas wrote in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MAN WITHOUT A FACE: THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF COMMUNISM'S GREATEST
SPYMASTER &LR;  By Markus Wolf with Anne McElvoy. Public Affairs, $14.
The former chief of East German intelligence tells how he spent
more than 30 years planting moles, running agents, orchestrating
betrayals and living the secret life. He ``comes across as a clever
and cultivated man'' who nonetheless ``chose to follow a dark
star,'' David Wise wrote in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; IDENTITY &LR;  By Milan Kundera. Harper Perennial, $13. The hero of
this dreamlike novel sends his girlfriend anonymous love letters to
pick up her spirits, with disastrous results. ``Kundera lucidly
discloses the psychological obsessions of the two lovers and how
these obsessions lead to repeated miscommunications,'' Robert
Grudin wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   The same publisher has reissued  &UR; LAUGHABLE LOVES &LR;  ($13), a
collection of the author's tales steeped in anger and fascination
with the communists running the show in Prague in the '60s. In 1974
the reviewer Paul Theroux called Kundera ``a magnificent
short-story writer'' whose ``best humor always seems to be rooted
in authority situations.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE HUNTERS &LR;  By James Salter. Vintage International, $13. The
author's first novel, originally published in 1956, is about a
fighter pilot's harrowing tour of duty in the Korean War and the
jealousies and competition among his fellow squadron members.
Praising the book, George Barrett urged readers to ``curl up for a
flight ... so `clear you can see tomorrow.'''

ROYALS LOSE AGAIN TO DEVIL RAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DICK KAEGEL  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ Sometimes Royals manager Tony Muser's
post-game ruminations seem like replays. And he knows it only too
well. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There he was after Saturday night's 8-2 loss to the Tampa Bay
Devil Rays repeating himself again. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We've said it before,'' Muser said. ``Walks are the worst
enemy for a baseball team. Errors and walks are giveaways that get
you in trouble.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   His starting pitcher, Jay Witasick, was the god of giveaways as
35,769 fans gathered at Tropicana Field. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the first inning, Witasick made an error that helped the
Devil Rays score three unearned runs. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the second inning, he walked two batters with two outs and
then gave up a three-run homer to Fred McGriff. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The score was 6-0, and Witasick was done. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a quick night,'' he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It sure was. The game was over, but the last seven innings were
played anyway, out of deference to Abner Doubleday. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the Royals were still numb after losing Friday night on
three walks and a hit batter by reliever Scott Service. Losing
without the other team putting the ball in play can do that. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It affects you emotionally, but it's something we've had a lot
of practice at. Let's put it that way,'' Muser said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been able to overcome some pretty tough losses.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Not on this night, during which a Florida thunderstorm shook the
dome. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Royals' hitting continued its free fall. Run production is
down to a relative dribble in this high-scoring season. They've
scored more than five runs just twice in the last 14 games. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Devil Rays right-hander Dave Eiland rocked them to sleep for
five innings before successive hits by Rey Sanchez, Mike Sweeney
and Jermaine Dye and a ground-out gave them their only two runs. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Witasick immediately got into trouble, although the Devil Rays
didn't get the ball out of the infield when they loaded the bases
in the first. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Two singles were stopped by shortstop Sanchez, and then
McGriff's one-out tap toward the mound was missed by Witasick. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It took two small bounces, and I was waiting for the third,
and it just stuck to the turf,'' Witasick said. ``It just went
right under my glove.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Third baseman Joe Randa snared John Flaherty's grounder and got
a force-out at the plate. But Paul Sorrento got a two-run single on
a grounder that took a nasty hop past second baseman Jed Hansen. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``I almost got it in my teeth,'' Hansen said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jose Guillen followed with an RBI single for a 3-0 lead. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Witasick had two outs in the second when he walked Dave Martinez
and Jose Canseco. With an 0-2 count on McGriff, he threw a
curveball. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It was off-speed and something that fluttered high in the
strike zone,'' Muser said. ``Maybe a ball but very whackable. And
McGriff whacked it.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Two little-used bullpen residents finished the game. Chris
Fussell gave up one run in four innings, and Mac Suzuki allowed one
run in two innings. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Royals beat up on the expansion Devil Rays last season,
winning eight of 11 games. But they are only 2-7 against them this
year. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Witasick is 0-2 in three starts against Tampa Bay with a 10.48
ERA. And this time he lasted just two innings. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're missing the strike zone in and out and up and
down, you're not going to last long,'' he said. &QL;

JOHNSON BEATS PIRATES, 4-2 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DON KETCHUM  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH _ His fastball hisses like the snake on his cap. His
slider breaks across the plate at the last second and can cause
hitters' knees to quiver and go out of joint.
</P>
<P>
   On an ``off'' day, well, Diamondbacks left-hander Randy Johnson
still is better than most pitchers in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson admitted he was not at the top of his gameSaturday
night, yet still managed to keep the Pittsburgh Pirates under
control as Arizona recorded a 4-2 victory at Three Rivers Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   He pitched his 10th complete game of the season, scattering six
hits, walking one and striking out eight and raised his record to
13-8. Pirates first baseman Kevin Young hit two solo homers off
him, but he came back to strike Young out the next two times.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona (71-52) maintained its 7{-game lead over San Francisco
in the National League West Division. The Giants won their second
straight over the Brewers in Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Randy did what good pitchers do when they don'thave their
overpowering stuff _ he PITCHED,'' said Diamondbackspitching coach
Mark Connor. ``He's given up two runs or less in hislast 12 starts
D that's incredible. I've never had anybody likehim.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Johnson: ``I didn't have some of my beststuff, but I feel
like I put in a good day's work. I got some quick outs _ they would
swing at the first couple of pitches _ and that helped. I didn't go
deep in the count too many times. I got some ground balls, andgot
good defense behind me.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the second efficient start in a row for Johnson. He threw
107 pitches in eight innings when he beatthe Chicago Cubs on Monday
night and followed that up with 113 Saturdaynight.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fewer pitches I throw now, the more fresh I'll be later in
the season,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And the closer he getsto a complete game, the better for the
bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   ``As theseason wore on, the bullpen has gotten stronger, and a
big reason for thatis because guys like Randy take their games
deeper (longer),'' said Diamondbacks Manager Buck Showalter.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson did not strike out abatter until the third inning _ his
mound opponent, left-hander Jimmy Anderson _ but got the Big K when
he needed it. He needs eight to reachthe 300 mark for the season
and should get that in his next start on Thursday against the
Florida Marlins in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Entering Saturday's game, he had fanned 10 batters or more in a
game six straight times and 19 this season.
</P>
<P>
   He struck out Young for the final out of the sixth, got
pinch-hitter Dale Sveum (a Diamondback during the spring who played
briefly for Triple-A Tucson) to begin the eighth and got Young and
former Arizona State shortstop Mike Benjamin in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't have his good stuff, but he knew it. He's
abattler,'' said catcher Damian Miller. ``He was flying open a
fewtimes on his delivery, so I reminded him of that, and that he
was losinghis concentration a couple of times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Complete games aresort of important to him, but strikeouts . .
. I don't think he reallycares. If he strikes out 15 and loses,
he's probably a bitter humanbeing, but if he strikes out six or
seven and wins . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd much rather throw 114 pitches and strikeout five or six
and win than throw 145 pitches and strike out 10 andlose,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Miller said that most of the game, Johnson was inthe 94-95 mph
range, ``but when it counted, like in the ninth, he wascloser to 97
and that nasty slider was there.''
</P>
<P>
   TheDiamondbacks scored once in each of the first three innings.
Luis Gonzalezdrove in Tony Womack with a single in the first, Jay
Bell drove in Steve Finley with an infield hit in the second, and
Matt Williams scored in the third when Pirates second baseman
Abraham Nunez let a sharp grounder by Finley go through his legs
for an error.
</P>
<P>
   Young, meanwhile, kept Pittsburgh (61-62) close with his 18th
and 19th homers.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks tacked on a big insurance run in the seventh
when Greg Colbrunn drew a two-out walk and scored on a double by
Bernard Gilkey. Pirates left fielder John Wehner moved to his left
toward the gap in left-center and appeared to hesitate on to
whether to dive for the ball or let it bounce. He did both and the
ball got by him. &QL;
