<P>
   NEW YORK _ Carl Rachlin, a New York labor and civil rights
lawyer who rallied to the defense of Freedom Riders and sit-in
demonstrators during the 1960s, died on Saturday at his home in
Manhattan. He was 82.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was heart failure, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the most intense struggle against segregation,
Rachlin was general counsel to the Congress of Racial Equality
(1960-67), and he worked closely with civil rights leaders,
including James Farmer and Bayard Rustin. Over the years, he also
represented the National Welfare Rights Organization and sat on the
board of the New York Civil Liberties Union.
</P>
<P>
   He was also legal director of the Scholarship, Education and
Defense Fund for Racial Unity from 1963 to 1969. In 1964, he helped
form and lead the Lawyers Constitutional Defense Committee, which
enlisted lawyers to defend civil rights campaigners in the Deep
South.
</P>
<P>
   Rachlin fought such cases all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court.
He filed a review that prompted the court in June 1961 to overturn
the conviction of six Freedom Riders who had entered a ``whites
only'' waiting room at a Louisiana bus terminal.
</P>
<P>
   In 1964 he was a leading lawyer in an action that led the
Supreme Court to throw out the convictions of thousands of young
people, black and white, who struggled to desegregate public
accommodations in the South.
</P>
<P>
   He also spoke for welfare recipients. In one class action in the
federal courts in 1969, he challenged a state's right to reduce
benefits without a clear constitutional mandate.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Rachlin was born in Brooklyn. He graduated from New York
University and from Harvard Law School. He practiced labor law as a
member of the New York firm of O'Donnell, Schwartz, Glanstein &AMP;
Rosen until last May, when he helped form the labor law firm of
Koehler &AMP; Isaacs, whose principal clients include the New York City
Correction Officers' Benevolent Association.
</P>
<P>
   Rachlin is survived by his wife of 57 years, Helen Raebeck
Rachlin; two daughters, Margaret Pine and Ruth Menard, both of
Manhattan; a sister, Vita Citron of Lawrence, in Nassau County,
N.Y., and three grandchildren.

The bad news continued for the University of Texas on Monday when
school officials learned that quarterback Major Applewhite has a
torn anterior cruciate ligament and will need reconstructive
surgery on his left knee.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Applewhite will undergo surgery Jan. 14. Doctors estimate his
rehabilitation time to be six months.
</P>
<P>
   ``This obviously is a setback to Major and our football
program,'' said Texas coach Mack Brown, ``He has been so productive
and such a great leader. We will support Major through the surgery
and rehab process and anxiously await his return to the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone knows and has seen what a great competitor Major is,
and that makes the injury even more difficult for us to take. But
it also gives us great confidence that he will return even better
next season.''
</P>
<P>
   Applewhite, a sophomore from Baton Rouge, La., who was the Big
12 Offensive Player of the Year in 1999, learned the extent of his
knee injury after undergoing a magnetic resonance imaging exam
Monday afternoon in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Applewhite injured his knee in the fourth quarter of Saturday's
27-6 loss to Arkansas in the Cotton Bowl. He was sacked five times
in the game, but the injury came on a play on which he was not
touched.
</P>
<P>
   Applewhite was rolling to his right to avoid an Arkansas
defensive lineman. The cleats on Applewhite's left shoe caught in
the grass, and he twisted his knee as he slid to the ground.
Applewhite was taken to the locker room and did not return to the
game.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, the worst fears of the Texas coaches and players
were confirmed, but Brown is optimistic Applewhite can recover
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Major will be back sooner than the doctors expect,'' Brown
predicted. ``With his work ethic, grit and determination, he will
be back in action as fast as humanly possible. We certainly expect
him back and ready in the fall.''
</P>
<P>
   But the ACL injury means Applewhite will miss all of spring
practice, which is scheduled to begin Feb. 15 and continue for
three weeks. Tms iLonghorns' Nimms werestarmmsps.om Fd hen on orbaM

 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
NEW ORLEANS _ Florida State vs. Virginia Tech. No. 1 vs. No. 2.
Need we say anything more?
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tickets to watch the two best teams in the country play for the
national championship in the Sugar Bowl tonight are being scalped
for as much as $2,000. So why do the players sound like used car
salesmen?
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't get any better than this,'' Virginia Tech cornerback
Ike Charlton said. ``If you're a football fan, this is what you
need to see.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're bris the way football will be played in the
next millennium _ hard and fast with a lot of spectacular plays.
I'm just hoping most of them will be for us. Change that: I expect
most of them to be for us.''
</P>
<P>
   So is this a football game or a three-ring circus?
</P>
<P>
   ``Get your chips and dip, your popcorn and peanuts and go to the
bathroom before the show starts,'' said Florida State linebacker
Tommy Polley. ``It's going to be better than you think. I wouldn't
miss it if I were you. It's one of those games where if you blink,
you could miss somebody go 80 yards.''
</P>
<P>
   If you believe the players, the game will be played at breakneck
speed. The coaches agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you like fast-break basketball, you should love this
game,'' Florida State coach Bobby Bowden said. ``Now, that doesn't
mean there will be a lot of scoring, because the defenses are too
good. If both teams played to their best, then I think we have a
10-7 game. That's how good the defenses are. But one mistake, one
tiny slip-up, and it's a touchdown for either side. Now, that's
exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlantic Coast Conference champiida State brings arguably
the game's most exciting player to the stage, while Virginia Tech
probably fields the other guy in that argument. One difference: The
Seminoles' star is a senior, while the Hokies' leader is a redshirt
freshman.
</P>
<P>
   Receiver Peter Warrick is the key to Florida State's offense. He
had 71 receptions for 934 yards and eight touchdowns in 1999,
despite missing two games for the 11-0 Seminoles. Warrick added
three rushing touchdowns and returned a punt 75 yards for another
score.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-0, 195-pound dynamo was held in check by Tennessee in last
year's championship game, netting one catch for seven yards in the
Fiesta Bowl. But the Seminoles vow to ensure Warrick gets the ball
early and often against the Hokies.
</P>
<P>
   Starting quarterback Chris Weinke missed last year's Fiesta Bowl
with a neck injury, but the stout 6-5, 240-pounder will be under
center tonight. He threw for 3,103 yards and 25 touchdowns this
season, including a school-record six TDs against Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   While Florida State works to get Warrick the ball, Virginia Tech
(11-0) has no trouble wondering if its offensive star will get his
touches.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Michael Vick will be on display with every snap.
</P>
<P>
   ``It changes what you do, knowing that your quarterback can make
something happen on every play,'' Virginia Tech offensive
coordinator Rickey Bestle said. ``Sometimes we don't even have to
do it or design it, and he can make us look good.''
</P>
<P>
   Bestle was making a subtle reference to a play earlier in the
season. Vick entered a ballgame without his wristband that had the
plays and formations drawn on it. Because the wristband was left in
the locker room at the half, Vick borrowed one from backup
quarterback Dave Meyer.
</P>
<P>
   But Meyer is a lefthander, and the plays were drawn in the
opposite direction of those for the righthanded Vick. Not knowing
that was the case, Vick went the wrong way on the play.
</P>
<P>
   Some 15 seconds and 75 yards later, he was prancing in the end
zone with a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal on every play is to score a touchdown, right?'' Vick
asked. ``Well, it worked.''
</P>
<P>
   Vick has ripped off a run of 20 or more yards in nine of the 10
games he has played this season for the Big East champions. For
good measure, he led the country in passing efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   Defensively, both teams are fast and believe the artificial turf
at the Superdome will make them faster.
</P>
<P>

of the Year and Lombardi Award gotly,

NEW ORLEANS _ Look close, and you can see the resemblances.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The aging crinkles around the eyes of Bobby Bowden provide an
occasional glimpse of Marv Levy on the sidelines. Quarterback Chris
Weinke winds up to throw another pass, and he's a dead ringer for
Jim Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   Trade in the feathered lance on the side of the helmets for a
charging bison. Substitute the garnet-and-gold for the
red-and-blue.
</P>
<P>
   Yikes! It's college football's version of the Buffalo Bills.
</P>
<P>
   When the Florida State Seminoles hit the field tonight for the
Nokia Sugar Bowl, their challenge will be to overcome not only
upset-minded Virginia Tech but also the that they can't
close the big deal.
</P>
<P>
   For all the sighs of relief around the globe that the Y2K
catastrophes never materialized, probably no single group has been
waiting to exhale more than the Seminoles.
</P>
<P>
   While it is an indisputable fact Florida State was the
winningest Division I-A program in the past decade, it is also
undeniable that the Seminoles were also the most unfulfilled, with
just a single national championship won at the 1994 Orange Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   In the terms of retiring cartoonist Charles Schulz, Bowden's
boys have had the ultimate football prize pulled away from them
just one less time than Charlie Brown by Lucy.
</P>
<P>
   The Seminoles have finished ranked among the top four an
unprecedented 12 seasons in a row. However, twice in the past three
years they have had an opportunity to wear the crown and wound up
with nothing more than a bump on their head.
</P>
<P>
   If it wasn't Tennessee leaving them stranded in the desert of
the 1999 Fiesta Bowl, then it was archrival Florida swallowing them
as easily as a Pat O'Brien's hurricane in the 1997 Sugar Bowl.
</P>
<P>

 By JONATHAN FEIGEN  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
So the Rockets slap around the Clippers, take a few days off,
apparently knock back a few on New Year's Eve, and suddenly they're
talking playoffs.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But that's not it at all.
</P>
<P>
   After the five-game losing streak that began the night Charles
Barkley went down in Philadelphia, the Rockets have played well.
And the retooled offense seems to be clicking, having gone nearly
three weeks since the last time it had to be retooled.
</P>
<P>
   But the Rockets said their interest in making up lost ground is
not sudden or some sort of new year's resolution. If they are
delusional, they insist it's not a sudden condition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, no, no, no, no,'' center Kelvin Cato said. ``I don't think
anybody ever lost the idea of the postseason. We knew it would be a
harder task to make the postseason. But that always was the goal.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea has just begun to come up because the Rockets find
themselves with the kind of schedule they can use to climb out of
the hole dug in the season's first two months.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning tonight against the Seattle SuperSonics, the majority
of games against playoff-quality teams are at home.
</P>
<P>
   Cato
</P>
<P>
   When the Rockets do face contenders on the road, as with
Thursday's game in Miami, the games are isolated, with days off to
prepare. The next back-to-back situation comes on the last two days
of February, with both games in the same city, Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The month might begin with the Sonics, Heat and Jazz, but the
only way to make up for a 10-20 start is to beat such teams, and
the schedule offers about the best chance the Rockets can hope to
find. Besides, at 10 games on the wrong side of .500, the Rockets
knew they had to make a move soon if they wanted to cling to those
playoff thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't wait until March,'' Cato said. ``We've got to get it
done now. But the schedule works in our favor. We have a lot of
home games in January and February.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully being at home, we'll get a bunch more wins. We
didn't do so well in the beginning of the year playing at home. But
we're playing better as a team. As a team, we're starting to
realize that if we hold on to the ball, we can beat teams. And if
we play better defense, we can beat teams. That's what the better
teams in the league are doing right now _ they hold on to the ball
and play better defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting better. We're getting better guard play now.
We're getting better post play. Even though we're not coming into
the post, we're getting post scoring.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the positive thinking, he said, is the result of the new
calendar.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not worried about what happened last year,'' Cato said.
``We're worried about what's going to happen next year.''
</P>
<P>
   But more than glancing at the schedule or calendar, the Rockets
have said their own play has offered hope that the expectations
with which they began the season are not necessarily lost.
</P>
<P>
   They have not had a winning streak since winning the three games
prior to Barkley's injury. But they have split their last six
games, and in the rout of the Clippers they racked up season highs
in points (122) and assists (36) and had a season-low 10 turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is true we do have a chance to get it going,'' guard Steve
Francis said. ``If we keep playing hard and keep learning like we
have been, we can make the playoffs. I'm not counting the playoffs
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've started over a few times. But I think now we have what
we're going to go with for a while. And I think it's working pretty
well for us. I think we still have a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Rudy Tomjanovich has not put a sudden emphasis on
immediately turning around the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's 82 games,'' he said. ``It would be good if it happened
now. But we can't pick our time.''
</P>
<P>
   Expectations and goals, he maintained, have changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``You lose two of the top 50 ballplayers of all time, it's got
to change unless you're a dreamer,'' he said. ``I like to dream.
But I'm not that big of a dreamer.''
</P>
<P>
   But with those disclaimers out of the way, he said the mindset
has not changed as much as it might seem. He said improvement has
been so important, he did not want to focus solely on wins and
losses to ensure that the results of games would not stunt his
team's growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always want to win,'' he said. ``I just can't emphasize
that enough. But if you're noenough to win, what do you do,
go nuts?
</P>
<P>
   ``Even when we were winning, when we won 15 in a row (to start
the 1994 season), we didn't say, `This is a time to win 15 in a
row.' We just took the next game, we took our practices, we got
better, and it just so happened they all were wins. Our approach
hasn't changed that much.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, it might seem an odd time to speak of making a run at the
playoffs, particularly for a team carrying a 10-20 record. The
Rockets insist at 10-20 they cannot wait much longer to make a
move, and they know they have to beat more than just the Clippers
to put together a winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a chance to turn things around and be successful,''
Francis said. ``You definitely want to steal wins when you can
becausee some good teams coming in.''
</P>
<P>
   And if it's late enough to have a sense of urgency, the Rockets
said it's too early to write off the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's 52 games left,'' Cato said. ``If we win 35 of those
games, we're a playoff team, I think. The West is tough. I don't
think a .500 team will make the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we're still a playoff team this year, just like everybody
was talking about at the beginning of this year.''

WE must applaud the football gods' sense of humor. Buffalo at
Tennessee? Heh, heh. Tennessee at Buffalo would have been better,
but this is pretty good stuff, particularly with Bum's boy, Wade,
now coaching the Bills.
</P>
<P>
   You can change your name, the city you represent and your color
scheme. What the Tennessee Titans, nee Houston Oilers, have to
answer now  they change their intrinsic nature? While most
of the faces are different, the Titans could still use a terminal
full of skycaps to help carry the pile of Oilers baggage they lug
into the NFL's first post-millennium postseason.
</P>
<P>
   The fact they won a franchise-record 13 games and failed to
conquer their division _ something no 13-3 team had managed before
them _ should be a warning to the naive citizenry of Nashville.
Theirs is a star-crossed franchise, perhaps the most hexed, vexed
and perplexed the league has ever seen. They have no idea what kind
of disappointment may yet befall them, unless the Titans have fully
exorcised the Houston demons from their collective psyche.
</P>
<P>
   Fact is, the Titans enter these flip-a-coin, draw-a-straw
playoffs as the NFL's best team. They beat 14-2 Jacksonville twice,
drubbing the Jaguars 41-14 in their most recent meeting. They

 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
Bill Parcells walked at his own pace, but Ray Rhodes and Pete
Carroll were shoved through the revolving door for head coaches
that gets crowded at this time each year.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The day after the last Sunday of the regular season is
traditionally known as Black Monday around the NFL because so many
coaches are fired. Compared to last season, when five coaches wred the day after the season, Monday was relatively calm unless
you are a fan of the Jets, Packers or Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells, who is destined for the Pro Football Hall of Fame,
resigned as the New York Jets' head coach Monday to concentrate on
his duties as the team's director of football operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the end of my coaching career,'' said Parcells, 58.
``I've coached my last game. You can't fool yourself. It's turned
into a 365-day-a-year job.''
</P>
<P>
   Parcells called his players into a team meeting and read them a
poem, Man in the Glass, then left the room.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells coached the Jets for three seasons, including an 8-8
finish this season. Under terms of the deal he signed with the Jets
after leaving New England, Parcells' resignatio that Bill
Belichick, his assistant head coach and defensive coordinator,
becomes the Jets' new head coach.
</P>
<P>
   Belichick, who was Parcells' defensive coordinator with the New
York Giants, coached the Cleveland Browns from 1991-95, compiling a
37-45 record before he was fired and reunited with Parw Englich

INTERNET MOGUL TO BUY DALLAS MAVERICKS FOR AN EXPECTED $280

c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A Dallas Internet entrepreneur has agreed to buy the Dallas
Mavericks, the worst-performing team in professional sports in the
'90s, for about $280 million, sources close to the deal said Monday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Cuban, who made more than $1 billion as co-founder of
Broadcast.com, has agreed to buy the basketball team for more than
double the estimated $125 million that Ross Perot Jr.'s group paid
less than four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The sale, projected to be completed by March, would close a
controversial public chapter for Perot, the managing partner who
failed to turn the team into a playoff contender yet stands to net
a major windfall.
</P>
<P>
   One source said Perot was simply overwhelmed by Cuban's offer,
which was significantly higher than recent unsuccessful bids for
the Vancouver Grizzlies and a large chunk of the Charlotte Hornets.
</P>
<P>
   Another source suggested that Perot had tired of the negative
publicity surrounding the team, from the continuing losses to the
struggles of coach Don Nelson to its latest troubles with top draft
pick Leon Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who is now receiving psychiatric care, signed a
million-dollar contract last year but has never played for the
team, and Mavericks management has been criticized for not helping
him make the adjustment from high school to professional sports.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban, 41, who has often talked about his interest in sports
teams, had explored buying the Pittsburgh Penguins hockey club last
year. For several years he has held Mavericks season tickets along
the front row, sitting near the players.
</P>
<P>
   Sources close to the Mavericks and their likely new owner
described Cuban Monday as ``a passionate'' sports fan, eager to get
into the professional game.
</P>
<P>
   Perot delegated all management of the Mavericks and never became
involved in player decisions. Cuban is expected to be a much more
hands-on owner.
</P>
<P>
   ``He plans to make the Mavericks something people are buzzing
about,'' said someone close to Cuban. ``If that takes opening the
pocketbook and if that takes bringing a superstar here, he's
willing and ready to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   At the next Mavericks home game, Cuban plans to celebrate the
purchase by buying drinks for fans at the Mavs club, the source
said.
</P>
<P>
   Perot, who has acknowledged that he was never much of a sports
fan, said he pursued the team because he believed that it could be
a catalyst for real estate development.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, he and Tom Hicks, owner of the Dallas Stars hockey
team, spearheaded an election campaign that narrowly won voter
approval and $125 million in taxpayer subsidies for a new arena
near downtown Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Perot and Hicks are jointly developing about 65 acres
surrounding the site. Sources said Perot will continue to develop
the so-called Victory project after selling the Mavericks.
</P>
<P>
   Perot and top officers of Hillwood, his development company,
could not be reached to comment Sunday night. Cuban did not respond
to messages.
</P>
<P>
   Although Perot controls the Mavericks ownership group with a 51
percent stake, several others also hold positions.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Zaccanelli, a longtime Perot associate who briefly handled
the basketball duties _ and who is best known for orchestrating the
trade of superstar Jason Kidd _ has a small stake.
</P>
<P>
   Auto dealer David McDavid has 16 percent of the team. The A.H.
Belo Corp., which publishes ``The Dallas Morning News'' and
operates television station WFAA, bought a 12.5 percent interest
last summer. Several others, including Horace Ardinger, Lindsay
Embrey and Hal Browning, hold the remaining stakes.
</P>
<P>
   Some owners may remain as minority partners under Cuban, a
source said. Perot, for example, plans to continue to hold a stake,
the source added, in part because the team and arena will be the
centerpiece of his Victory development.
</P>
<P>
   The letter of intent on the Mavericks sale also calls for
Perot's company to continue marketing and developing the arena
project until one year after the arena opens. But Cuban will take
over the team as soon as the sale receives approval from the
National Basketball Association.
</P>
<P>
   The Perot group expects that process to be completed by March.
</P>
<P>
   The value of the Mavericks has soared despite a poor record on
the court and weak turnout among fans. Since Perot took over, the
Mavericks have won 72 and lost 172, and attendance has ranked about
25th in a league of 29 teams.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts attributed the increase in the team's value to three
factors: the new facility, which will be called the American
Airlines Center and will feature 130 corporate suites; a collective
bargaining agreement reached between players ars after a
lockout last year; and a new $2.6 billion broadcast contract
between the NBA and two television networks.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement between players and owners sets a salary cap,
allowing teams to keep a lid on costs.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban and Todd Wagner started Broadcast.com in 1995 in Cuban's
spare bedroom as a way for the two Indiana University graduates to
hear Hoosiers basketball games in Dallas. The company now operates
out of a 28,000-square-foot converted warehouse equipped with
satellite dishes that pull in TV and radio signals from around the
world.
</P>
<P>
   Wagner and Cuban sold $30,000 in shares in the company
themselves until finding a private underwriter and trading equity
to Motorola, Intel, Yahoo and other partners. When the company went
public in July 1998, Wall Street went wild.
</P>
<P>
   From an opening price of $18 a share, the stock shot to $72
before closing its first day at $62.75.
</P>
<P>
   The stock price began climbing again early last year, and went
over the $100 mark after reports ted that the company would
be bought by Yahoo, based in Santa Clara, Calif. In April 1999,
Cuban and Wagner agreed to sell to Yahoo in a deal then valued at
$5.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The company has yet to turn a profit, but analysts suggest that
it will become profitable in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Yahoo Broadcast, formerly Broadcast.com, agreed to
stay in Dallas' Deep Ellum section after the city offered
abatements and tax breaks. The subsidiary of the Internet company
Yahoo will more than triple its operations by adding 700 jobs in a
data center and technical support center in the area just east of
downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo Broadcast, which places audio and video feeds on the
Internet, currently employs about 300 people in two small
warehouses.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to a 10-year tax abatement, the city agreed to
abandon two streets needed by the company to renovate a larger
warehouse. The city will also provide about $250,000 in
infrastructure costs and $90,000 in development fee rebates.

   A Dallas Internet entrepreneur has agreed to buy the Dallas
Mavericks, the worst-performing team in professional sports in the

year. For several years he has held Mavericks season tickets along
the front row, sitting near the players.
</P>
<P>
   Sources close to the Mavericks and their likely new owner
described Cuban Monday as ``a passionate'' sports fan, eager to get
into the professional game.
</P>
<P>
   Perot delegated all management of the Mavericks and never became
involved in player decisions. Cuban is expected to be a much more
hands-on owner.
</P>
<P>
   ``He plans to make the Mavericks something people are buzzing
about,'' said someone close to Cuban. ``If that takes opening the
pocketbook and if that takes bringing a superstar here, he's
willing and redo that.''
</P>
<P>
   At the next Mavericks home game, Cuban plans to celebrate the
purchase by buying drinks for fans at the Mavs club, the source
said.
</P>
<P>
   Perot, who has acknowledged that he was never much of a sports
fan, said he pursued the team because he believed that it could be
a catalyst for real estate development.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, he and Tom Hicks, owner of the Dallas Stars hockey
team, spearheaded an election campaign that narrowly won voter
approval and $125 million in taxpayer subsidies for a new arena
near downtown Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Perot and Hicks are jointly developing about 65 acres
surrounding the site. Sources said Perot will continue to develop
the so-called Victory project after selling the Mavericks.
</P>
<P>
   Perot and top officers of Hillwood, his development company,
could not be reached to comment Sunday night. Cuban did not respond
to messages.
</P>
<P>
   Although Perot controls the Mavericks ownership group with a 51
percent stake, several others also hold positions.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Zaccanelli, a longtime Perciate who briefly hanhe basketball duties _ and who is best known for orchestrating the
trade of superstar Jason Kidd _ has a small stake.
</P>
<P>
   Auto dealer David McDavid has 16 percent of the team. The A.H.
Belo Corp., which publishes ``The Dallas Morning News'' and
operates television station WFAA, bought a 12.5 percent interest
last summer. Several others, including Horace Ardinger, Lindsay
Embrey and Hal Browning, hold the remaining stakes.
</P>
<P>
   Some owners may remain as minority partners under Cuban, a
source said. Perot, for example, plans to continue to hold a stake,
the source added, in part because the team and arena will be the
centerpiece of his Victory development.
</P>
<P>
   The letter of intent on the Mavericks sale also calls for
Perot's company to continue marketing and developing the arena
project until one year after the arena opens. But Cuban will take
over the team as soon as the sale receives approval from the
National Basketball Association.
</P>
<P>
   The Perot group expects that process to be completed by March.
</P>
<P>
   The value of the Mavericks has soared despite a poor record on
the court and weak turnout among fans. Since Perot took over, the
Mavericks have won 72 and lost 172, and attendance has ranked about
25th in a league of 29 teams.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts attributed the increase in the team's value to three
factors: the new facility, which will be called the American
Airlines Center and will feature 130 corporate suites; a collective
bargaining agreement reached between players and owners after a
lockout last year; and a new $2.6 billion broadcast contract
between the NBA and two television networks.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement between players and owners sets a salary cap,
allowing teams to keep a lid on costs.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban and Todd Wagner started Broadcast.com in 1995 in Cuban's
spare bedroom as a way for the two Indiana University graduates to
hear Hoosiers basketball games in Dallas. The company now operates
out of a 28,000-square-foot converted warehouse equipped with
satellite dishes that pull in TV and radio signals from around the
world.
</P>
<P>
   Wagner and Cuban sold $30,000 in shares in the company
themselves until finding a private underwriter and trading equity
to Motorola, Intel, Yahoo and other partners. When the company went
public in July 1998, Wall Street went wild.
</P>
<P>
   From an opening price of $18 a share, the stock shot to $72
before closing its first day at $62.75.
</P>
<P>
   The stock price began climbing again early last year, and went
over the $100 mark after reports circulated that the company would
be bought by Yahoo, based in Santa Clara, Calif. In April 1999,
Cuban and Wagner agreed to sell to Yahoo in a deal then valued at
$5.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The company has yet to turn a profit, but analysts suggest that
it will become profitable in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Yahoo Broadcast, formerly Broadcast.com, agreed to
stay in Dallas' Deep Ellum section after the city offered
abatements and tax breaks. The subsidiary of the Internet company
Yahoo will more than triple its operations by adding 700 jobs in a
data center and technical support center in the area just east of
downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo Broadcast, which places audio and video feeds on the
Internet, currently employs about 300 people in two small
warehouses.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to a 10-year tax abatement, the city agreed to
abandon two streets needed by the company to renovate a larger
warehouse. The city will also provide about $250,000 in
infrastructure costs and $90,000 in development fee rebates.

INTERNET MOGUL TO BUY DALLAS MAVERICKS FOR AN EXPECTED $280
MILLION
</HEADLINE>
 
(DUPLICATION ALERT: Story also moving in ``s'' sports, and ``a''
general news categories) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A Dallas Internet entrepreneur has agreed to buy the Dallas
Mavericks, the worst-performing team in professional sports in the
'90s, for about $280 million, sources close to the deal said Monday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Cuban, who made more than $1 billion as co-founder of
Broadcast.com, has agreed to buy the basketball team for more than
double the estimated $125 million that Ross Perot Jr.'s group paid
less than four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The sale, projected to be completed by March, would close a
controversial public chapter for Perot, the managing partner who
failed to turn the team into a playoff contender yet stands to net
a major windfall.
</P>
<P>
   One source said Perot was simply overwhelmed by Cuban's offer,
which was significantly higher than recent unsuccessful bids for
the Vancouver Grizzlies and a large chunk of the Charlotte Hornets.
</P>
<P>
   Another source suggested that Perot had tired of the negative
publicity surrounding the team, from the continuing losses to the
struggles of coach Don Nelson to its latest troubles with top draft
pick Leon Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who is now receiving psychiatric care, signed a
million-dollar contract last year but has never played for the
team, and Mavericks management has been criticized for not helping
him make the adjustment from high school to professional sports.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban, 41, who has often talked about his interest in sports
teams, had explored buying the Pittsburgh Penguins hockey club last
year. For several years he has held Mavericks season tickets along
the front row, sitting near the players.
</P>

TITLE GAMES, SCRUTINY NOT NEW TO SEMINOLES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LeBRETON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ For Bobby Bowden this is all so very familiar.
</P>
<P>
   Another press conference. Another bowl game. Another question
about his Florida State team's citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   And _ yawn _ another shot at college football's national
championship.
</P>
<P>
   For the third time in four seasons, Bowden has a team perched on
destiny's doorstep. Unmask the latest challenger, an overachieving
Virginia Tech team, and the Seminoles can rightfully lay claim as
college football's team of the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   Stumble again, however, and Bowden knows what his team will hear
for the next 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   ``A guy the other day wrote that we're the Buffalo Bills of
college football,'' Bowden said. ``The players made each other hear
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, it's cold but it's true. The Seminoles are victims of their
own success, and all that it brings with it, the expectations as
well as the scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   Bowden gives the impression that he has either heard it all or
been asked about it.
</P>
<P>
   His best player, Peter Warrick, served a notable two-game
suspension that likely cost him the Heisman. In an unrelated
incident, Bowden has another player still in jail, unable to post
bail. And a likely all-conference receiver was kicked off the team
in midseason, after being caught in the same incident as Warrick.
</P>
<P>
   When he was asked about his recruiting ``style'' Monday, though,
Bowden had a prompt answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The type of players we recruit are the same type that we
recruited 20 years ago when we won the Sunday School Award,'' he
said. ``We recruit the best kids we can, and if they're bad
characters we don't sign them.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's not the bad kids who are bad all the time. It's your
good kids, who come from great families, that go out and do
something wrong. Just like you did when you were a kid.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowden went on to spin a country analogy about the windows that
he broke with rocks when he was growing up in Alabama. It is the
venerable coach's great gift, being able to turn the blandest
response into a Hank Williams lyric.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hasn't changed,'' Bowden claimed, reversing the question.
``You're not keeping up with history. That's been going on for
2,000 or 3,000 years _ the conduct of individuals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just that now everybody knows about it. And if you don't
want people to know about it, don't be No. 1. Be No. 50, because
then nobody will ever know.''
</P>
<P>
   The Seminoles' latest transgressors were curfew violations. Big
cities. Bright lights. A week in a hotel room, having to share
elbow space with a 300-pound lineman. Curfew violations have become
the parking tickets of the college bowl season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody ran to get something going with that,'' Bowden told
the assembled media. ``But you forget. I had 103 kids who didn't
break curfew, so I'd guess our curfew must be working.''
</P>
<P>
   The audience smiled. Bowden smiled. He had that ``let's get back
to talking about the game'' look on his face.
</P>
<P>
   But he's been here and answered that. Florida State is never
going to be No. 50, not as long as Bowden is around.
</P>
<P>
   The intriguing part of this Sugar Bowl is that FSU's opponent
Tuesday night, coach Frank Beamer's Hokies, has been there, to the
college football basement and back. Virginia Tech's presence in the
title game both endorses the Bowl Championship Series concept and
sours it.
</P>
<P>
   The Hokies rightfully bristle at the suggestion that they don't
belong here, under the bright lights, a few steps away from the big
casinos.
</P>
<P>
   ``The perception is probably best exemplified by my wife,''
Beamer said, ``who said that we keep opening up newspapers, and
it's almost like you're reading about someone else.''
</P>
<P>
   It used to be a big thing, Beamer said, for Virginia Tech to get
its final scores in ``USA Today.'' Now the national paper is doing
feature stories about the Hokies' deep snapper, who also happens to
be Beamer's son.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really believe when people watch us play,'' Beamer said,
``they enjoy watching us, because we do play hard. We've got guys
who worked hard to make us a good football team. A lot of them
weren't heavily recruited. They're guys who enjoy the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would think that if people were pulling for the underdog,
they would really like this Virginia Tech team.''
</P>
<P>
   For Florida State, being cast as the bully in Tuesday's showdown
will be nothing new. The calendar has turned, but the stage has
remained the same.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the likely edge that the Seminoles will show in depth and
quickness Tuesday night, there is no denying that FSU abounds in
big-game experience. Bowden's staff alone has a combined 143 years
working for him.
</P>
<P>
   It is the one edge that the 11-0 Hokies cannot counter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've prepared as well as we know how,'' Bowden said on Sugar
Bowl eve.
</P>
<P>
   This time, it says here, his team really does have all the
answers.
</P>
<P>
   Let's say Florida State 30, Virginia Tech 20. nn

FLOUNDERING SEAHAWKS A `PEANUTS' PLAYOFF CONTENDER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   For about a half-hour Sunday in the Meadowlands, Lucy, for the
12th consecutive season, pulled the ball away from Charlie Brown's
placekick attempt.
</P>
<P>
   But wait. In the weirdest sports development of the century,
Lucy brought the ball back down. The kick was up, and good!
</P>
<P>
   In the week that ``Peanuts'' creator Charles Schulz officially
retires, the Charlie Browns of the NFL are in the playoffs. Too
much cannot be made of these confluences of cultural currents.
</P>
<P>
   That is, unless you have a better explanation for the extra game
the Seahawks acquired by means other than justice and good works.
</P>
<P>
   Merely referring to the postseason appearance as a back-door
entry doesn't capture the lameness.ahawks achieved the
playoffs in a metaphorical way that perhaps only Rae Carruth can
appreciate _ shivering in the trunk of a car.
</P>
<P>
   Any team that rides into the playoffs on the narrow shoulders of
Oakland scrub kicker Joe Nedney, whose name has yet to evoke images
of Alexander the Great and Genghis Khan, is not a team to be taken
seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Nedney? Was Jar Jar Binks too busy?
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks are in, but more by the force of gravity than any
particular skill or artistry. They have been on a six-week dive of
such magnitude that oceanographers' instruments no longer detect
them.
</P>
<P>
   The one victory in that time, two weeks ago against the Chiefs,
was diminished Sunday, considering that Kansas City could not hold
a 17-0 lead at home against a rival it had owned like a scrawny
little brother for a decade.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, the Seahawks' 19-9 pratfall against the Jets was
peculiarly rancid because for much of the game,
</P>
<P>
   &UR; rr &LR;
</P>
<P>
   the Seahawks went at it with the intensity of a fern sale at
Chubby &AMP; Tubby.
</P>
<P>
   In what turned out to be his final game as coach, Bill Parcells
coaxed a solid game from his Jets. But he had nothing to do with
the Seahawks' listlessness, which was remarkable, given the
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have liked to have seen more flying around, more
recklessness,'' Seahawks coach Mike Holmgren said Monday after
reviewing the damage on video. ``I don't think people can fake that
too much.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to them a little bit at halftime about the lack of
that. I don't really have a good answer for you.''
</P>
<P>
   If Holmgren is stumped, imagine the puzzle for the rest of us
watching a team in a must-win game pad about like Sunday morning at
a bed and breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   After spending a season waiting for some leaders to emerge on
both sides of the ball, Holmgren gets another week to continue the
hunt for players who can take over when the coaching stops. Hard to
imagine he will become suddenly successful.
</P>
<P>
   ``I trust now with the new season, we have no choice,'' he said
of the presumed approach to the playoffs. He paused to consider the
context, then allowed somewhat ruefully, ``We probably didn't have
any choice Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   His players found an option, taking the lesser road.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the curious passivity goes beyond football. Perhaps it is
becoming a local cultural characteristic.
</P>
<P>
   After Seattle Mayor Paul Schell's published declaration that he
is ``not a wuss,'' everyone immediately knew otherwise, just as
Richard Nixon insisted he was ``not a crook.''
</P>
<P>
   It may be that the Seahawks are a mere reflection of the local
times, in which the preferred posture is a low-slung cower. Since
Schell has identified himself as a former college linebacker, he
might have a new career with the Seahawks, should his cuob
continue not working out.
</P>
<P>
   But if these episodes of Seattle knock-knee are unrelated, the
football flop can be at least partly explained by a bum knee,
specifically the one owned by running back Ricky Watters, who can
no longer cut or block.
</P>
<P>
   That made an already mediocre offense worse. Although
quarterback Jon Kitna is flaming out in his first year as a
starter, the Seahawks were obliged to throw a season-high 45 times,
completing just 21, against the Jets.
</P>
<P>
   That led to a time-possession differential of 37 minutes, 33
seconds for New York to 22:27 for Seattle. But that was hardly a
shocker. In the most tell-tale statistical sign of teamwide
inefficiency, the Seahawks finished the regular-season last in the
AFC in time of possession, third worst in the entire NFL.
</P>
<P>
   That is not the stuff of contention. Moreover, the ineptness
manifested despite a schedule almost downy by NFL standards. They
played only three teams that made the playoffs, beating Buffalo and
losing to Detroit and Tampa Bay. They were also 2-5 against the
dull welter of teams that finished 8-8 in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Miami Dolphins are widely perceived to be
floundering just as badly, Seattle's playoff opponents are thrilled
to have drawn the Seahawks. The Kingdome is certainly a formidable
place to play the game, but the Seahawks are a team that's been
figured out by the NFL. And now they must play against one of the
game's shrewdest coaches without an effective running game and with
no proven heart anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   OK, they're in the playoffs, but ... good grief, Charlie Brown.
</P>
<P>
   One would think that a sports team owned by Microsoft's
co-founder would be a little more Y2K compliant.

<TEXT>
<P>
   A Dallas Internet entrepreneur has agreed to buy the Dallas
Mavericks, the worst-performing team in professional sports in the
'90s, for about $280 million, sources close to the deal said Monday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Cuban, who made more than $1 billion as co-founder of
Broadcast.com, has agreed to buy the basketball team for more than
double the estimated $125 million that Ross Perot Jr.'s group paid
less than four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The sale, projected to be completed by March, would close a
controversial public chapter for Perot, the managing partner who
failed to turn the team into a playoff contender yet stands to net
a major windfall.
</P>
<P>
   One source said Perot was simply overwhelmed by Cuban's offer,
which was significantly higher than recent unsuccessful bids for
the Vancouver Grizzlies and a large chunk of the Charlotte Hornets.
</P>
<P>
   Another source suggested that Perot had tired of the negative
publicity surrounding the team, from the continuing losses to the
struggles of coach Don Nelson to its latest troubles with top draft
pick Leon Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who is now receiving psychiatric care, signed a
million-dollar contract last year but has never played for the
team, and Mavericks management has been criticized for not helping
him make the adjustment from high school to professional sports.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban, 41, who has often talked about his interest in sports
teams, had explored buying the Pittsburgh Penguins hockey club last
year. For several years he has held Mavericks season tickets along
the front row, sitting near the players.
</P>
<P>
   Sources close to the Mavericks and their likely new owner
described Cuban Monday as ``a passionate'' sports fan, eager to get
into the professional game.
</P>
<P>
   Perot delegated all management of the Mavericks and never became
involved in player decisions. Cuban is expected to be a much more
hands-on owner.
</P>
<P>
   ``He plans to make the Mavericks something people are buzzing
about,'' said someone close to Cuban. ``If that takes opening the
pocketbook and if that takes bringing a superstar here, he's
willing and ready to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   At the next Mavericks home game, Cuban plans to celebrate the
purchase by buying drinks for fans at the Mavs club, the source
said.
</P>
<P>
   Perot, who has acknowledged that he was never much of a sports
fan, said he pursued the team because he believed that it could be
a catalyst for real estate development.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, he and Tom Hicks, owner of the Dallas Stars hockey
team, spearheaded an election campaign that narrowly won voter
approval and $125 million in taxpayer subsidies for a new arena
near downtown Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Perot and Hicks are jointly developing about 65 acres
surrounding the site. Sources said Perot will continue to develop
the so-called Victory project after selling the Mavericks.
</P>
<P>
   Perot and top officers of Hillwood, his development company,
could not be reached to comment Sunday night. Cuban did not respond
to messages.
</P>
<P>
   Although Perot controls the Mavericks ownership group with a 51
percent stake, several others also hold positions.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Zaccanelli, a longtime Perot associate who briefly handled
the basketball duties _ and who is best known for orchestrating the
trade of superstar Jason Kidd _ has a small stake.
</P>
<P>
   Auto dealer David McDavid has 16 percent of the team. The A.H.
Belo Corp., which publishes ``The Dallas Morning News'' and
operates television station WFAA, bought a 12.5 percent interest
last summer. Several others, including Horace Ardinger, Lindsay
Embrey and Hal Browning, hold the remaining stakes.
</P>
<P>
   Some owners may remain as minority partners under Cuban, a
source said. Perot, for example, plans to continue to hold a stake,
the source added, in part because the team and arena will be the
centerpiece of his Victory development.
</P>
<P>
   The letter of intent on the Mavericks sale also calls for
Perot's company to continue marketing and developing the arena
project until one year after the arena opens. But Cuban will take
over the team as soon as the sale receives approval from the
National Basketball Association.
</P>
<P>
   The Perot group ethat process to be completed by March.
</P>
<P>
   The value of the Mavericks has soared despite a poor record on
the court and weak turnout among fans. Since Perot took over, the
Mavericks have won 72 and lost 172, and attendance has ranked about
25th in a league of 29 teams.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts attributed the increase in the team's value to three
factors: the new facility, which will be called the American
Airlines Center and will feature 130 corporate suites; a collective
bargaining agreement reached between players and owners after a
lockout last year; and a new $2.6 billion broadcast contract
between the NBA and two television networks.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement between players and owners sets a salary cap,
allowing teams to keep a lid on costs.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban and Todd Wagner started Broadcast.com in 1995 in Cuban's
spare bedroom as a way for the two Indiana University graduates to
hear Hoosiers basketball games in Dallas. The company now operates
out of a 28,000-square-foot converted warehouse equipped with
satellite dishes that pull in TV and radio signals from around the
world.
</P>
<P>
   Wagner and Cuban sold $30,000 in shares in the company
themselves until finding a private underwriter and trading equity
to Motorola, Intel, Yahoo and other partners. When the company went
public in July 1998, Wall Street went wild.
</P>
<P>
   From an opening price of $18 a share, the stock shot to $72
before closing its first day at $62.75.
</P>
<P>
   The stock price began climbing again early last year, and went
over the $100 mark after reports circulated that the company would
be bought by Yahoo, based in Santa Clara, Calif. In April 1999,
Cuban and Wagner agreed to sell to Yahoo in a deal then valued at
$5.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The company has yet to turn a profit, but analysts suggest that
it will become profitable in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Yahoo Broadcast, formerly Broadcast.com, agreed to
stay in Dallas' Deep Ellum section after the city offered
abatements and tax breaks. The subsidiary of the Internet company
Yahoo will more than triple its operations by adding 700 jobs in a
data center and technical support center in the area just east of
downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo Broadcast, which places audio and video feeds on the
Internet, currently employs about 300 people in two small
warehouses.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to a 10-year tax abatement, the city agreed to
abandon two streets needed by the company to renovate a larger
warehouse. The city will also provide about $250,000 in
infrastructure costs and $90,000 in development fee rebates.

   &UR; INTERNATIONAL _ (Moved in ``i'' category)  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   JAPAN-WEALTH (Tokyo) _ The gap between rich and poor Japanese is
widening, spurred by changes in the economy and in society. People
are living longer and accumulating more wealth. Increasingly, pay
is being set by performance rather than seniority. Tax laws have
been changed to let the the rich keep more of their money, and
loopholes once exploited by the middle class are closing. ``In
seven or eight years, Japanese society will look much more like
Western society, with gaps between rich and poor that can be
clearly seen,'' said Shoji Hiraide, general manager of Mitsukoshi's
flagship department store branch in Tokyo, which has begun a
campaign to woo the wealthy. By Stephanie Strom.

<P>
   DIVIDENDS-MARKETPLACE (Undated) _ A growing portion of corporate
America appears to be concluding that dividends are no longer

of doing business. Fewer companies are raising dividends, and more
and more major companies do not bother to pay them at all. By Floyd
Norris.
</P>
<P>
   HEALTHCARE-SUITS (Undated) _ HMO companies _ like cigarette,
lead paint and gun manufacturers _ are under a growing legal
bombardment. The assault includes at least 16 class-action
lawsuits, and several new state laws and measures in Congress could
open the industry to still more suits. The federal law that has
long protected many managed care companies is being whittled away
in a series of court decisions in various malpractice cases. That
is why the industry is looking to guidance from the Supreme Court,
which will hear an important test case in February. By Milt
Freudenheim.

city immediately conjures up images of drug cartels, guerrillas and
gangs of kidnappers and hired killers. But Medellin is also the
hometown of Fernando Botero, 68, Latin America's most celebrated
living artist, and he is now putting the full weight of his renown
behind a wide-ranging effort to overhaul the city's reputation and

   SCI-GENIUS-CRACKPOTS (Undated) _ The down side of become a famed

of ``cosmic theorists,'' who attend talks and lectures with the

a willingness to engage the wooliest of theorists more often than
might be believed. The reasons vary, from fear of insulting someone

   &UR; By NINA KHRUSHCHEVA &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The hardest thing about power is knowing when to let go. The
next hardest, particularly in a country like Russia which has
experienced nothing but dictatorship for a millennium, is knowing
whom to hand power to.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing his resignation on Dec. 31 Boris Yeltsin may have
succeeded on both counts, assuring not only his personal safety and
political legacy, but his place in history and Russia's infant
democracy.
</P>
<P>
   By now Yeltsin is more than the man who saved Russia when a coup
by Communist hard-liners threatened to turn back the clock by
nullifying Mikhail Gorbachev's perestroika and glasnost. In nine
muddy years since, Yeltsin has also created a new Russia, very much
in his own image: one unpredictable, wayward, but full of promise.
By stepping down now, Yeltsin has given his handpicked successor,
Vladimir Putin, the best chance to win elections that will take
place in March.
</P>
<P>
   Shades of the Kremlin of old? Aimed at Yeltsin, a deft
maneuverer of the old school of Communist politics, the gibe is
tempting. It is also unfair.
</P>
<P>
   With mandatory presidential elections approaching next year,
Moscow was awash in rumors: ``feeding time at the zoo,'' as one
former British prime minister called it. By ending the whispering
campaign that he intended to cling to power no matter what, Yeltsin
deserves more cheers than jeers.
</P>
<P>
   Through this orderly and constitutionally correct device to
attempt to assure his succession, Yeltsin may have precluded any
possibility of a chaotic power struggle for the Kremlin without
sacrificing democratic principles. Russia may now go on to complete
its transition from communism to capitalism.
</P>
<P>
   But what do we know of the heir apparent, Acting President
Putin? In keeping with his shadowy KGB background, very little.
Putin is married with two daughters, 47 years old and a graduate of
Saint Petersburg University's Law Faculty. Stationed for a decade
as a KGB agent in the former East Germany, he also saw Western
democratic and business practices up close, and by now is belie be committed to them.
</P>
<P>
   After communism's collapse, he worked for the liberal mayor,
Anatoly Sobchak, and alongside other young reformers like Anatoly
Chubais in the St. Petersburg government of the early 1990s.
Transferred to Moscow, he headed the Federal Security Service, or
FSB (the transformed KGB), until Yeltsin suddenly appointed him
prime minister last August.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his murky profile, Putin's most potent claim to fame,
and to power, is a renowned toughness. In the bloody mountains and
ruined cities of Chechnya, Putin established his credentials as the
man needed to restore order and stop the country's internal
disintegration by revitalizing state power.
</P>
<P>
   That the West seems nervous about Putin only enhances his
prestige at home. With Western economic policy prescriptions widely
seen as having failed in Russia; with NATO expanding near to the
country's borders and old allies like Serbia bombed; with America
seen as wanting to weaken Russia even more, breaking it up into
pieces and controlling the oil-rich Caspian basin, anti-Western
sentiments are on the rise. Putin's political antenna have caught
this trend. The chance that the West eyes Russia's acting president
with suspicion makes him even more desirable to the traditional
Russian heart.
</P>
<P>
   Vladimir Putin, however, prefers to promote the impression of
being a more enlightened and modern leader. His prime ministerial
New Year's address _ ``Russia at the Turn of the Millennium'' _ was
posted on the Internet, at a government website, for all the world
to see before being published in Russian newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   In it he outlined his prial program. Playing to the
crowds, he declared that Russia is no plaything for the West to
kick around. But demagoguery stopped there. Russia, he also
declared, must mend itself. It will remain cooperative and friendly
with the world, provided that the world is cooperative and friendly
too. But the hard work of rebuilding Russia must be done by
Russians, and with no time to waste.
</P>
<P>
   In Russia cultural instincts, in which communal ideas remain
more valued than individualist principles, help determine the
success or failure of policies. The national strategies Putin will
likely follow will take into account these social impulses. Thus he
is unlikely to publicly trumpet the unforgiving capitalist policies
of Yegor Gaidar and Chubais, even if he quietly pursues them.
</P>
<P>
   Undoubtedly a strong patriot, Putin also knows that Russia's
national idea of itself must be cleansed of haughtiness and
imperial ambitions. The Russia he envisions will be a great power
once more, but great in the ways that a truly modern society must
be: in its democratic commitments, its economy and its domestic
tranquillity.
</P>
<P>
   The consensus in Russia today is that Putin is a man of neither
great talents nor great vices. To ordinary Russians he appears as
modest, principled and honest, a vast contrast with the tainted
politicians of the Yeltsin years. He is a perfect fit for a Russia
grown tired of the heroes, revolutionaries, criminals and even
saviors, who make life exciting but rarely stable.
</P>
<P>
   A poll conducted in September by the Moscow Public Opinion
Foundation showed that what Russians most want is a new Brezhnev,
whose nearly 20 years (1964-1982) of leadership once was disdained
as the ``era of stagnation,'' but now is nostalgically recalled as
a ``golden ear of stagnation.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin almost fits this mold of firmness and seriousness, which
ensures stability, a strong state and a ``golden middle'' between
radical reforms and strong-arm rule.
</P>
<P>
   In the back of their minds, however, Russians also hold a secret
fear. It concerns a type of man, a pleasant, quiet individual who
walks softly through the Kremlin corridors, someone who
uncomplainingly takes on _ and completes _ many hard and unpleasant
tasks while others fight noisily for high position. One day that
unassuming political beast of burden suddenly comes out on top, as
Stalin did in the early 1920s. Of President Putin Russia, like
history, must reserve its judgement.

to be committed to them.
</P>
<P>
   After communism's collapse, he worked for the liberal mayor,
Anatoly Sobchak, and alongside other young reformers like Anatoly
Chubais in the St. Petersburg government of the early 1990s.
Transferred to Moscow, he headed the Federal Security Service, or
FSB (the transformed KGB), until Yeltsin suddenly appointed him
prime minister last August.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his murky profile, Putin's most potent claim to fame,
and to power, is a renowned toughness. In the bloody mountains and
ruined cities of Chechnya, Putin established his credentials as the
man needed to restore order and stop the country's internal
disintegration by revitalizing state power.
</P>
<P>
   That the West seems nervous about Putin only enhances his
prestige at home. With Western economic policy prescriptions widely
seen as having failed in Russia; with NATO expanding near to the
country's borders and old allies like Serbia bombed; with America
seen as wanting to weaken Russia even more, breaking it up into
pieces and controlling the oil-rich Caspian basin, anti-Western
sentiments are on the rise. Putin's political antenna have caught
this trend. The chance that the West eyes Russia's acting president
with suspicion makes him even more desirable to the traditional
Russian heart.
</P>
<P>
   Vladimir Putin, however, prefers to promote the impression of
being a more enlightened and modern leader. His prime ministerial
New Year's address _ ``Russia at the Turn of the Millennium'' _ was
posted on the Internet, at a government website, for all the world
to see before being published in Russian newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   In it he outlined his presidential program. Playing to the
crowds, he declared that Russia is no plaything for the West to
kick around. But demagoguery stopped there. Russia, he also
declared, must mend itself. It will remain cooperative and friendly
with the world, provided that the world is cooperative and friendly
too. But the hard work of rebuilding Russia must be done by
Russians, and with no time to waste.
</P>
<P>
   In Russia cultural instincts, in which communal ideas remain
more valued than individualist principles, help determine the
success or failure of policies. The national strategies Putin will
likely follow will take into account these social impulses. Thus he
is unlikely to publicly trumpet the unforgiving capitalist policies
of Yegor Gaidar and Chubais, even if he quietly pursues them.
</P>
<P>
   Undoubtedly a strong patriot, Putin also knows that Russia's
national idea of itself must be cleansed of haughtiness and
imperial ambitions. The Russia he envisions will be a great power
once more, but great in the ways that a truly modern society must
be: in its democratic commitments, its economy and its domestic
tranquillity.
</P>
<P>
   The consensus in Russia today is that Putin is a man of neither
great talents nor great vices. To ordinary Russians he appears as
modest, principled and honest, a vast contrast with the tainted
politicians of the Yeltsin years. He is a perfect fit for a Russia
grown tired of the heroes, revolutionaries, criminals and even
saviors, who make life exciting but rarely stable.
</P>
<P>
   A poll conducted in September by the Moscow Public Opinion
Foundation showed that what Russians most want is a new Brezhnev,
whose nearly 20 years (1964-1982) of leadership once was disdained
as the ``era of stagnation,'' but now is nostalgically recalled as
a ``golden ear of stagnation.''
</P>
<P>
   Putin almost fits this mold of firmness and seriousness, which
ensures stability, a strong state and a ``golden middle'' between
radical reforms and strong-arm rule.
</P>
<P>
   In the back of their minds, however, Russians also hold a secret
fear. It concerns a type of man, a pleasant, quiet individual who
walks softly through the Kremlin corridors, someone who
uncomplainingly takes on _ and completes _ many hard and unpleasant
tasks while others fight noisily for high position. One day that
unassuming political beast of burden suddenly comes out on top, as
Stalin did in the early 1920s. Of President Putin Russia, like
history, must reserve its judgement.

<P>
   Vladimir Putin is Russia's Mr. Nice Guy. Everyone admires him.Like a young prince, he exudes the charm of political freshness.
Always on the move, this man still appears to be shy, even though
in a mere five months he has ascended from being an unknown
bureaucrat, to being prime minister, and now the acting president
of Russia.
</P>
<P>
   And the people's affection for Putin has only seemed to grow as
he has backed away from being labeled a Russian hero.
</P>
<P>
   By now, I honestly believe, Putin is ready to work selflessly
for the good of this humiliated country. Russia has long yearned
for light at the end of the tunnel, and with Putin we have received
hope that we are going to see it after all.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, for months the 47-year-old politician has had control
of the military and many daily operations of government, these
passed on to him by the progressively ailing, 68-year-old Boris
Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   Undeniably, there are people who think that Putin's popularity
is exclusively the result of the Chechen factor _ that is, his
tough prosecution of what the Kremlin has called a ``fight against
Islamic bandits and terrorists'' in the republic of Chechnya. I beg
to differ.
</P>
<P>
   Putin is the focus of many old and new aspirations of the
Russian people: for a strong arm, for youthfulness and integrity of
political leadership and for national revival. Liberals and
patriots, pro-marketeers and statists, rich and poor, generals and
human-rights activists have been equally willing to stake their
hopes on him.
</P>
<P>
   As prime minister, Putin showed the rare talent of being all
things to all men. Placing their bets on him were figures as
diverse as media tycoon Boris Berezovsky, economic reformer Yegor
T. Gaidar and former Vice President Aleksandr Rutskoi, who led a
'93 coup attempt against the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
   When Yeltsin _ with his corruption scandals, health debacles and
single-digit opinion-poll ratings _ abruptly named Putin
heir-apparent, it could have nipped Putin's career in the bud.
Instead, Putin appeared to thrive on the challenge.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 19, two new pro-Kremlin parties and a host of candidates
in the parliamentary elections were able to ride Putin's coattails
to victory. Since then, the Kremlin has been in a state of euphoric
glee. At last it found a winner! You can criticize Yeltsin for
plenty of things, and to be sure he has lost authority and
credibility. But you have to admit he was determined to keep the
country under his control _ indeed, to his last political breath.
</P>
<P>
   To Putin's credit, however, all the stardom did not swell his
head. He seemed little inclined to overrate his own success: One
has to hand it to him. Presumably, he realized that soon enough
there would be harder things to do. Now, the most difficult
questions he may be asking himself are these: What is my most
effective political resource? How long will this training flight
last? What will I have to face when I touch down?
</P>
<P>
   Being a sensible person, Putin must realize that there is a good
deal of the irrational and fairytale-like in the popular affection
for him, which is generally characteristic of the Russian people.
Putin says he will improve the people's life, and they believe him.
He says he will get the better of the Chechen rebels, and everyone
gives a cheer. He swears he will uproot corruption, and we
desperately want to take it on trust.
</P>
<P>
   Yet lurking behind Putin's sudden and effortless emergence are
some formidable problems. Suppose, as everyone is predicting, he
does win the election, which is now rescheduled for March 26, and
he becomes Yeltsin's successor?
</P>
<P>
   What will happen the day after he is installed at the Kremlin?
Who will be the first to enter his office and get down to real
work? Will he have anyone to rely on? His ``king makers,'' perhaps?
Or will he rely on an enchanted nation of people who, having cast
their votes, now expect him to wave his magic wand and put all
things right?
</P>
<P>
   Certainly among the crowd of eager political associates, who are
just dying to share the ``spoils of war'' and push through the
Kremlin gate, there are none disinterested enough to share the
burden and responsibility of leading the government and stabilizing
the country.
</P>
<P>
   After all, it is one thing to say: ``I assume responsibility for
Chechnya,'' using Yeltsin's backing and power, but quite another to
mobilize one's own resources and run the country full-time.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the Kremlin's aggressiveness in the run-up to the
parliamentary election was Putin's most effective tool. The public
was treated to a barrage of pro-Chechen-war, pro-government,
pro-Putin, anti-opposition propaganda on the leading media outlets,
which are monopolized and controlled by the Kremlin and its allies.
But popularity cannot be kept up indefinitely by these means alone.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, by tacitly encouraging the persecution of his
political opponents, Putin has not only made powerful rivals, he
has effectively brought them to a boiling point. Very soon,
however, he must gather a totally different kind of support. He
will have to set efficient policies _ economic, financial, social,
scientific and cultural. Will Putin be able to attract the type of
human resources he needs for this?
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's political demise, as well as the ``change of guard''
at the top, will surely reactivate the power blocs that have, in
recent months, been deactivated and suppressed by the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far Putin has won out because his approval ratings have
soared to a dizzy height. I am afraid that in the long term,
however, the backing of his newfound liberal Kremlin allies will
not be strong enough. Putin's political fate largely hinges on
himself. Above all, on his readiness to meet halfway those who are
currently, and somewhat artificially, presented as his enemies.
</P>
<P>
   With Russia's tradition of intrigue and ugly power politics,
even if Putin does achieve success in the presidential election, he
will have an uphill struggle lying ahead.

   ALBANY, N.Y. _ ``The hardest thing about any political
campaign,'' two-time presidential candidate Adlai Stevenson said 44
years ago, ``is figuring out how to win without proving that you're
unworthy of winning.''
</P>
<P>
   That problem will confront both First Lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton and New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani as their contest for
the U.S. Senate unfolds this year. Each operates under significant
disadvantages, and each will confront a serious moral decision
early on.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani leads Clinton slightly in most polls, but that means
nothing almost 11 months before Election Day. New York remains a
5-3 Democratic state, and Giuliani will be duking it out with
Clinton in a presidential year, when Democrats turn out in force
and when independents turn out, too, generally to vote for
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, no New York City mayor in 130 years has won a
statewide race. More than a third of the New York vote is upstate,
and upstaters tend not to view New York City as part of the state.
The fact is, many upstaters harbor doubts that New York City is
even part of America.
</P>
<P>
   Add to that Giuliani's matchless gift for annoying people _ a
talent that towers over even former Mayor Ed Koch's breathtaking
capacity to offend _ and the mayor will need a big break to win
this election. That break would be the endorsement of New York's
Conservative Party.
</P>
<P>
   The Conservatives are a relatively small group, but many
independents vote on their line, and so do some Democrats who can't
bring themselves to vote for any candidate on the Republican line.
In the past, the Conservative line on the New York general election
ballot has been worth as many as 400,000 votes. George Pataki won
his first race for governor on votes the Conservatives gave him.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani suffers from a problem common to politicians who have
been around
</P>
<P>
   a while. That is, people tend to remember what they say. In New
York mayoral races, where he needed the Liberal Party line to win,
Giuliani has been firmly pro-choice even to the point of opposing a
ban on late-term abortions _ or partial-birth abortions, as they're
called because of the particularly gruesome method employed to end
such pregnancies.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Long, the Conservative Party chairman, firmly refuses to
support Giuliani until he changes his mind on late-term abortions.
Since Long has close ties to New York's GOP establishment, it is
possible that he will change his mind. But regardless of where you
might be on partial-birth abortion, watching Giuliani change his
mind for political gain would be a nauseating experience.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Clinton faces a similarly distasteful choice. Just as no
New York City mayor has won a statewide race, no woman has either.
In the polls, she runs well behind where she needs to be in New
York City. She will need a huge turnout among minority voters in
the city to combat Giuliani's popularity there. One way to spark
that turnout would be to appear before the Rev. Al Sharpton's
National Action Network in Harlem. There's a problem with that,
though.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton has a long history of Jew-baiting and inciting racial
hatreds. He lied blatantly about the Tawana Brawley case, falsely
accusing a young assistant prosecutor of rape and then refusing to
apologize even after the guy beat him in a civil case for
defamation. Sharpton has led demonstrations against ``white
interloper'' merchants in minority neighborhoods. The man is a
shameless race hater and nobody Clinton should hook up with in any
way, shape or form.
</P>
<P>
   For each of these candidates, though, the temptation to do what
it takes to win will be enormous. For each of them, the lure of
victory could easily outweigh the necessities of conscience. And
each of them is well aware that Adlai Stevenson ran for president
twice.
</P>
<P>
   Both times, he lost.

   MISSING-ATHEIST (San Antonio) _ A man charged in connection with
the disappearance of Madalyn Murray O'Hair and two of her adult
children says the atheist leader enlisted one of her former

the ``Sham Battle'' showcased the depth and versatility of

   ALBANY, N.Y. _ ``The hardest thing about any political
campaign,'' two-time presidential candidate Adlai Stevenson said 44
years ago, ``is figuring out how to win without proving that you're
unworthy of winning.''
</P>
<P>
   That problem will confront both First Lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton and New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani as their contest for
the U.S. Senate unfolds this year. Each operates under significant
disadvantages, and each will confront a serious moral decision
early on.

   Giuliani leads Clinton slightly in most polls, but that means

5-3 Democratic state, and Giuliani will be duking it out with

<P>
   WIGGINS-COLUMN _ WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ A reader called to say
he's sick to death of ``best of'' lists for the last millennium.
``Why don't you compile a biggest disappointments list?'' asked
Darryl Harris. ``Like what?'' I asked. ``Heaven's Gate? Halley's
Comet? Those comic book X-ray glasses that really don't let you see
through women's clothing?'' I said I would think about it and I
did. Here's my list. (Wiggins, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   ROSENFELD-SHORTTAKES _ There seems to be more than a smidgen of
disappointment that Y2K has, so far, been as little trouble as it's
been. (Rosenfeld, Cox News Service) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   TEEPEN-COLUMN _ Perhaps no great harm will have been done if
U.N. prosecutors quickly dispose of the tendentious charges that
NATO committed war crimes in Serbia and Kosovo and go back to the
tribunal's serious business. But if this farce is allowed to drag
on, the U.N. will have effectively given future license to the
crudest human-rights abusers. (Teepen, Cox News Service.) MOVED
MONDAY.
</P>
<P>
   KLEINBERG-COLUMN _ MIAMI _ No sooner had the calendar flipped to
a new year, century and millennium than the same old dilemma was
upon us again. A shabby wooden vessel carrying 411 Haitians,
Dominicans and Chinese ran aground just off the Miami area.
(Kleinberg, Cox News Service.) MOVED MONDAY.
</P>
<P>
   SCHUETT-COLUMN _ GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ Whether it's the time of
year or the time of life that has lately inspired me to thoughts of
so serious a nature, I cannot say for sure, but I too enjoy
contemplating the flames and grappling with heavy notions of
universal truth, cosmic awareness, and how that carpenter on ``This
Old House'' lost his finger. (Schuett, Cox News Service) MOVED.

to put money down (called an initiation fee) on top of the monthly

   TECH-COATING _ The quest for better materials is ancient, but a
young Atlanta-grown company has made materials its high-tech
strength. MicroCoating Technologies, founded in the Georgia Tech
incubator in 1993 by native Atlantan, Andrew T. Hunt, is built on a
thin but sturdy patented coating. The thin coating is used to
construct electronic circuits, and is now being adapted to many
uses as diverse as fuel cells and solar instruments. The company
grew through ``bootstrapping,'' mainly through revenues but has
managed to double in size every year _ and has been profitable from
the start. Grown to this point mostly by partnering with other
companies, MCT is now poised to go more independent through a plan
to go public. (Holsendolph, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

   CABLETV-THIEVES _ Welcome to cable TV theft in the 21st Century.
No longer are TV thieves interested in stealing a signal. Now
thieves want the equipment, valued between $1,000-$4,000 a box,
that sends and amplifies the signal. (Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). 30.

   LASTMINUTE-TRAVEL _ LastMinuteTravel.com's time has come, its
founders believe. The fledgling Atlanta-based Web site, which lists
offers aimed at spur-of-the-moment travelers, has fully activated
its site and launched a marketing campaign. It's even preparing a
Super Bowl TV ad _ usually the province of corporate titans. It
will air during the last minute of the Jan. 30 game. (Thurston,

   PERSONAL FINANCE
</P>

   MONEYTALK _ ATLANTA _ The beginning of a new year is a great
time to figure out where your personal finances stand _ and where
you want to take them. (Ezell, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   WALKER-CHANGES _ ATLANTA _ Advocates of change believe a new
securities market is emerging that will be especially good for
individual investors, opening doors once closed to all but Wall
Street insiders, while slashing the cost of trading. The outcome of
this turmoil will decide nothing less than the process by which
investors buy and sell stocks and other securities in the future,
and how the institutions that handle the trading do their jobs.
(Walker, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   PORTFOLIO-DRIPS _ ATLANTA _ Can you build a portfolio of
technology stocks on a shoestring budget? Now you can. Two firms
recently introduced an investment service that permits small
investors to dollar-cost-average their way into the shares of
companies _ such as Microsoft and Cisco Systems _ that don't offer
dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plans. DRIPs, as they are
known, are a popular way for investors without large sums of cash
to build stakes in the more than 1,200 companies that offer them.
(Luke, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED.

<P>
   TECHNOLOGY-MARKET _ ATLANTA _ The Internet revolution is just
the latest in a long history of technology-driven changes on Wall
Street, the most important of which were designed to speed the flow
of information. (Walker, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   2000-MARKET _ ATLANTA _ The stock market is a spindly looking
thing, very tall and very, very thin. The Nasdaq composite gained
85.6 percent in 1999, but just a handful of the thousands of stocks
in that index accounted for most of the rise. Among the stocks in
the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index, there were more losers than
gainers last year. Does that concern money managers and investment
strategists going into this year? Yes, but not nearly enough to
dash their generally bullish outlook. (McNaughton, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution MOVED.
</P>

   MARKET-WEBSITE _ ATLANTA _ Where do savvy fund managers,
analysts and economists go for information on the Internet? We
asked some of them. (Asokan, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED.

 &HT;    SHORTTAKES: Y2K peace was deafening
 &HT;    By Arnold Rosenfeld
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   There seems to be more than a smidgen of disappointment that Y2K
has, so far, been as little trouble as it's been. The television
networks, ever on the prowl for action, were reduced to crashing
parties. Lovely as the parties were, they were no match for the
exploding nuclear plants, falling airliners, errant missiles,
missing bank accounts and stranded elevators that had been
suggested.
</P>
<P>
   Y2K, although we may hear more from it later, is generally
viewed as a kind of letdown. Some folks are wondering if Y2K was
just another hyped, over-cooked media event typical of our age.
This is a back-door way of saying that a lot of people did a good
job preventing Y2K from becoming an unparalleled calamity. All
praise to them. We may have got things right this once.
</P>
<P>
   The terrorists apparently took a night off, too. I was
particularly worried about Jerusalem and New York City, and was
relieved when midnight passed quietly beyond both. The Eiffel Tower
and Red Square at midnight never looked better.

 &HT;    My take on the great philosoph  By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ I believe it must have been some time in the
winter of 429 B.C. When Socrates pronounced the unexamined life not
worth living. This sage disclosure soon led to crowds of folks in
bedsheets wandering around downtown Athens contemplating their
bunions and muttering profound stuff like: ``The future ain't what
it used to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Socrates, I suspect, also spent many an introspective evening in
front of the fire with only his cat, Felis Domesticus, and a bottle
of Bailey's for company. Winter has always been an illuminating
season.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it's the time of year or the time of life that has
lately inspired me to thoughts of so serious a nature, I cannot say
for sure, but I too enjoy contemplating the flames and grappling
with heavy notions of universal truth, cosmic awareness, and how
that carpenter on ``This Old House'' lost his finger.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally I find myself wondering about stuff such as why,
two days after the snow has melted leaving streets clear and dry,
the plows still rumble past, blades down and salt flying.
</P>
<P>
   Often, other weighty problems present themselves for my
consideration.
</P>
<P>
   Have you ever wondered why some restaurants play cutesy with the
signs on their restroom doors? Why, when a straightforward
``Ladies'' or ``Gentlemen'' would have done just fine, they have
chosen to use pictures?
</P>
<P>
   Seldom do I think of myself as dense or particularly
slow-witted, and a few of my friends have even commented on how
adept I am at reading street signs backwards, but I confess to more
than once having stood flatfooted between two restroom doors,
trying to translate some obscure glyph into a meaningful symbol
that will aim me in the appropriate direction before it's too late.
</P>
<P>
   Once in New Jersey I had to go back to the table and ask my
husband to come and show me which was which. We hadn't been married
very long and I could almost hear the wheels grinding in his head.
``Lord help you, fella,'' a little voice had to have been warning,
``you've promised to take care of this woman for the rest of your
life and she can't even find the ladies room.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, he admitted he felt better about the whole thing once he
spotted the source of my dilemma. There were no words on the doors,
only pictures _ one of a hen and one of a rooster. My country-bred
mate had no problem figuring it out but I had been raised in the
big city where chickens came fried or baked, but never with
genders.
</P>
<P>
   Recent evenings at the hearth have stimulated questions like:
Why'd the Lone Ranger have to die? And what happened to his ``great
horse'' Silver?
</P>
<P>
   Socrates has been gone a lot longer than the Lone Ranger, mainly
because he got himself into hot water with his fellow Athenians for
sitting around with their kids and making controversial statements
like: ``Virtue does not come from money...'' and ``It is never
right to do wrong....'' Even today such heresy could get him into a
whole lot of trouble but with one big difference _ contemporary
punishments are a lot more subtle than sipping hemlock at the
cocktail hour.
</P>
<P>
   And so folks, as winter's shadow lengthens, and a comfortable
fire beckons, I more and more find myself drawn to the wisdom of
the reflective thinkers in an attempt to understand life and my
place in it.
</P>
<P>
   Truth is out there, I have decided, but it is up to the seeker
to open his intellect to the enlightenment of great thinkers, even
the unlikely ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people don't want to come out to the ballpark, nobody's
going to stop 'em.'' (renowned North American philosopher, Yogi
Berra), also credited with the statement about the future not being
what it ``useterbe.''
</P>
<P>
   Socrates is in good company.

 &HT;    1,000-year list a tally of raves, ridicule
 &HT;    By Ron Wiggins
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ A reader called to say he's sick to
death of ``best of'' lists for the last millennium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why don't you compile a biggest disappointments list?'' asked
Darryl Harris of Lake Worth, Fla., a retired schoolteacher.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like what?'' I asked. ``Heaven's Gate? Halley's Comet? Those
comic book X-ray glasses that really don't let you see through
women's clothing?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, actually I was thinking more along the lines of WTMI-FM
in Miami canceling its Symphony at 10. I was very disappointed. It
was the only show where you could listen to a symphony or concerto
straight through.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, Darryl,'' I said, feeling his pain, but not all that
keenly, ``I'm not sure we want to start the new year with a list of
disappointments.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe,'' Harris proposed, ``you could alternate your
disappointment list with an overachiever list. You know, things
that could have been ordinary, but exceeded expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   I said I would think about it and I did. In fact, Harris had no
sooner rung off then I remembered what a washout Comet Kohoutek
turned out to be and how, with very little advance press, Hale-Bopp
burst into our skies with an awe-inspiring shake of a cosmic tail
feather.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, there was ``Ishtar,'' a stumbling embarrassment, but who
would have expected ``The Gods Must be Crazy'' to charm and beguile
us so?
</P>
<P>
   So I'll call them as I see them _ rhinestones where we expected
diamonds and gemstones where we might have settled for a
grindstone. Opinions do not necessarily reflect those of the
management.
</P>
<P>
   Underachiever: The Crusades. No Holy Grail. Darn near lost
Spain.
</P>
<P>
   Overachiever: Columbus. Exceeded expectations by encountering a
continent and remembering how to find it when only a trade route
was sought.
</P>
<P>
   Over: Penicillin: Everything Alexander Fleming could ask of a
mold and more.
</P>
<P>
   Over: Double rainbows.
</P>
<P>
   Under: Swine flu: Couldn't infect its way out of a wet Kleenex.
</P>
<P>
   Under: Founding Fathers _ for all their wisdom and lofty
insistence on God-given inalienable rights, made slaves and women
wait at the back door a century or two for theirs.
</P>
<P>
   Under: World War I, for making the world safe for democracy for
only about 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Over: VW Bug _ who would have thunk?
</P>
<P>
   Over: Japanese cameras, motorcycles, Datsuns, Toyotas, TVs, VCRs
_ ditto.
</P>
<P>
   Under: Renault, Fiat, Yugo: Ugh.
</P>
<P>
   Over: Spaghetti Westerns: Yay!
</P>
<P>
   Over: Twiggy _ Gained weight, looked good, fair actress.
</P>
<P>
   Way Over: Oprah _ Lost weight, looked good, superb actress.
</P>
<P>
   Over: Arnold _ Lifted weights, looked great, acting under alles.
</P>
<P>
   Over: The Donald _ Infinitely more amusing than the average
self-destructing politician.
</P>
<P>
   Under: The Ross: For pouring sand into his own engine by seeing
Bush ninjas under his bed. Also for failing to get any support for
his one superlative proposal, a 50-cent gas tax that would have
freed us from foreign oil, paid down the deficit and jump-started
alternative energy technology.
</P>
<P>
   Under: John Belushi for being such a nitwit at the peak of his
career. Ditto Len Bias for never even getting to his pro basketball
career.
</P>
<P>
   Over: John Belushi for being the best bad example ever.
</P>
<P>
   Under: The Spanish Inquisition, for giving enthusiasm a bad
name.
</P>
<P>
   Under: Rap music, for taking its sweet time in mutating into
whatever comes next.
</P>
<P>
   Under: Charles Schulz, for not sticking it out to delight us for
another 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   Over: Charlie Brown _ despite his inability to get a kite or a
football into the air, never failed to lift our spirits. May he
live kissing the cute red-headed girl ever after.
</P>
<P>
   Over, with oak leaf cluster, fireworks, double gaudy streamers
and confetti: The Wurlitzer Buke Box, Bill Haley, Etta
James, Chuck Berry, Little Richard, Elvis, Buddy Holly, Jerry Lee
Lewis, Big Joe Turner, the '57 Chevy and rock 'n' roll!

&HT;     A READING LIST TO CHERISH WITH CHILDREN 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JUDYTH RIGLER  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Seen enough lists to last you another 1,000 years?
</P>
<P>
   There is one more that might be worth studying, because it could
help provide a bright future for your child.
</P>
<P>
   Scholastic Inc., the children's publishing and media company,
has worked with teachers, librarians, parents and children
nationwide to generate a list of the best-loved and
most-recommended children's books.
</P>
<P>
   Scholastic calls the list ``200 for 2000'' and hopes to
encourage a nationwide push for literacy by introducing reading to
children as young as 3 months old and building on that foundation
to encourage lifelong readers.
</P>
<P>
   Three months old, you ask? Isn't that a bit ambitious?
</P>
<P>
   Not really, the editors at Scholastic say. As soon as a child
can sit in your lap and focus, he or she is able to detect language
patterns and inflections and see the interplay of color and type in
a book, newspaper or magazine.
</P>
<P>
   There are all kinds of activities that can be accomplished in a
15- or 20-minute daily reading period _ and the bonu
wonderful bonding experience that involves touching, talking,
thinking and sharing between parent and child. And reading doesn't
have to be just the let's-sit-down-and-open-Dr. Seuss kind. It can
be encouraged in all kinds of day-to-day routines, from grocery
shopping to reading street signs.
</P>
<P>
   But the essential element seems to be reading together, at home,
at the library, on trips, all the time.
</P>
<P>
   As the parent of two whose nightly reading sessions when they
were kids resulted in grownups with a lifetime reading habit, a
facility with language and a hunger for knowledge, I'm recommending
this list and the accompanying tips to every parent _ especially in
this technology-laden era when reading is often low on the list of
priorities.
</P>
<P>
   The full list of 200 books, which may be found on the Internet
at www.scholastic.com, includes recommendations for younger readers
(infants through third-graders) and older readers (fourth- through
eighth-graders).
</P>
<P>
   Here are a few highlights:
</P>
<P>
   In picture books and books for beginning readers, you'll find
classics and contemporaries sharing space _ ``Goodnight Moon,''
``Where the Wild Things Are,'' ``The Keeping Quilt,'' ``The Little
Engine That Could,'' ``If You Give Mouse a Cookie'' and more than
50 others.
</P>
<P>
   Concept books for younger readers include ``Stellaluna'' and
``Math Curse.''
</P>
<P>
   Fantasy and folktales include ``Aesop's Fables,'' ``Lon Po Po: A
Red-Riding Hood Story From China,'' ``The Legend of the Bluebonnet:
An Old Tale of Texas'' and ``Why Mosquitoes Buzz in People's Ears:
A West African Tale.''
</P>
<P>
   The poetry of Shel Silverstein and Eve Merriam is recommended,
along with others, as are series books such as Dr. Seuss and the
Arthur, Curious George, Madeline and Magic School Bus titles.
</P>
<P>
   Older readers may choose from biography/autobiography (``Anne
Frank: The Diary of a Young Girl,'' ``Rosa Parks: My Story'');
informational (``Rosie the Riveter: Women Working on the Home Front
in World War II,'' ``Aztec, Inca and Maya''); fantasy/sci-fi
(``James and the Giant Peach,'' ``The Phantom Tollbooth''); poetry
(``Cool Salsa: Bilingual Poems on Growing Up Latino,'' ``Dream
Keeper: And Other Poems''); and contemporary fiction (``Bridge to
Terabithia,'' ``Tomas and the Library Lady'' and ``Habibi.''
</P>
<P>
   Also in the older-reader category are classics ``A Tree Grows in
Brooklyn'' and ``Winnie-the-Pooh,'' series ``Little House Books''
and ``The Chronicles of Narnia,'' historical fiction ``Sarah, Plain
and Tall'' and ``The Yearling,'' and myths/legends/folktales ``The
Arabian Nights'' and ``The Rainbow People.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no greater gift you can offer a child than the wonders
to be found in books.

 &HT;    An abominable snow mandate
 &HT;    By The Practical Man
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The practical man spent five days in
hell last week.
</P>
<P>
   He was on vacation, in Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   No, it wasn't his idea. And no, he didn't have to pay for it.
Last summer, the Make-A-Wish people visited his 8-year-old
daughter, a cancer patient. Before he could intervene, she blurted
out her heart's desire: ``I want to see snow!''
</P>
<P>
   It was an icicle to the eye for the practical man, who groped
blindly for a way to change her mind. Desperate, he proposed
alternate wishes _ ``I want a college scholarship!'' ``I want to
widen our driveway!'' _ but they held no sway.
</P>
<P>
   So there he was, Christmas morning. He should have been snug in
his chair, boning up on ``Heat Transfer Principles in Modern Air
Conditioning'' while his Santa-soused kids carried on in the
Florida room. Instead, he was lost in the leafless forest of a
frozen Green Mountain summit, blue-lipped and frostbit, building a
snowman. His fans gathered round him, shouting words of
encouragement.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least we didn't have to pay for the snowshoes!'' said his
wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lick his nose, Daddy,'' said his daughter. ``He's delicious!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ah, a mountaintop,'' said Zeke, the crusty guide from the
lodge. ``You can't get any closer to the Good Lord himself!''
</P>
<P>
   He was right. The practical man could not feel his toes, but he
did start to ligious: ``For the love of God, Zeke!'' he
bellowed. ``Get us out of here!''
</P>
<P>
   Zeke freed the family from the woods, but no one escapes the
cold in Vermont. And as it turns out, that was a good thing, for
the practical man's daughter fulfilled every one of her snowy
wishes _ snowmen, snow angels, snowball fights and more _ and he
was able to compile this handy list of don'ts for practical
travelers to the North.
</P>
<P>
   Ski not: The practical man generally scoffs at sports, for they
are little more than elaborate ways to waste time and prolong
adolescence. But the Vermont state ``sport'' adds a couple of
twists _ namely, danger and discomfort _ that place it in the first
rank of foolishness. Here's how you play:
</P>
<P>
   Spend two grand on equipment, spend an hour putting it on, ride
the frosty steel seat of a rinky-dink lift a half-mile up a snowy
mountainside, then risk your life hurtling headlong back down on a
flimsy pair of fence slats. In the bitter cold of a blinding
blizzard, repeat until the inevitable debilitating injury.
</P>
<P>
   The practical man will pass.
</P>
<P>
   Think not: The practical man faces no more fearsome challenges
in the North than drab skies, short days and the deathly silences
of once thriving countrysides benighted by blankets of snow. After
a couple of gray days followed by 4 o'clock sunsets, it takes but a
flicker of a philosophy to send even the emotionally stable sliding
down a slippery slope to despair.
</P>
<P>
   Confronted by gloom, the practical man fends off depression by
turning off his mind. This feat can be accomplished in any number
of ways, but none, the practical man believes, is more efficient
than this: Pion.
</P>
<P>
   Kiss not: A mere week's stay in the North can wreck a lifetime
of good loving for the practical man and his bride, for every
smooch carries an unexpected sting: static electricity. Under such
conditions, it will take no more than a half-dozen painful pecks to
turn ardent admirers into wary adversaries who eyeball each other
like bull and cow on opposite sides of a charged wire. And the
effects will linger. Once lovers learn luscious lips can bite,
passion and pain will be linked, even when the couple returns to a
more romantic clime.
</P>
<P>
   The practical man's solution: The friendly wave goodnight.

 &HT;    Whether entertaining tots or party guests, stains will happen
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ My fiancee's 3-year-old granddaughter was sitting
on a bed coloring in a coloring book while my fiancee worked last
week.
</P>
<P>
   When my fiancee turned around to check, the baby had shifted
from coloring book to wall. She did her mural entirely in purple _
apparently an homage to the Artist formerly known as Prince from
the granddaughter formerly known as adorable.
</P>
<P>
   The first household cleaners we tried failed miserably, but a
little research turned up two solutions that worked fairly well.
Both rubbing alcohol and baking soda on a soft cloth removed the
crayon marks if applied with a little elbow grease.
</P>
<P>
   If you've been entertaining or plan to entertain this weekend,
you might need a little advice on removing stains. Here are a few
tips to handle spills on your carpets and furniture:
</P>
<P>
   ACT QUICKLY WHEN SPILLS HIT CARPET
</P>
<P>
   No carpet is completely stain-proof, but most carpets sold today
have been treated with chemical coatings that give you time to
clean up a spill before it soaks in.
</P>
<P>
   To protect your carpets and rugs, be prepared to act quickly
when a mishap occurs.
</P>
<P>
   When you spill a liquid on a carpet or rug, try to dab up the
excess liquid right away. Use a clean, dry, white absorbent cloth
or a white paper towel with no printed designs on it.
</P>
<P>
   Working from the outside edge of the spill, push the liquid
toward the center of the spill as you try to soak it up. Don't use
a scrubbing action because that only bends the carpet fibers out of
shape and may encourage the liquid to flow deeper into the carpet.
</P>
<P>
   For semisolid spills such as pudding, gently scrape up the spill
with a spoon.
</P>
<P>
   For solid spills, pick up what you can with your hands and
vacuum the rest up as quickly as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes blotting alone doesn't remove all the spilled
material, and you get a spot stain on the carpet. In that case,
you'll need to try a cleaning solution.
</P>
<P>
   The Carpet and Rug Institute, a trade organization, lists seven
do-it-yourself cleaning solutions to try. All the solutions are
used in about the same way.
</P>
<P>
   Start by testing the solution in an inconspicuous corner to be
sure it doesn't dissolve the dye in the carpet.
</P>
<P>
   Then apply a small amount of the recommended solution to a clean
white cloth and work it gently into the stain. Working from the
edge of the stain to the center, blot up the solution and the
stain.
</P>
<P>
   Be patient and keep repeating until the stain is gone or until
the color from the stain no longer transfers from the carpet to the
cleaning rag. If that happens before the stain disappears, try a
different solution.
</P>
<P>
   When the stain is gone, rinse the area with cool water and blot
with an absorbent towel until the cleaning-solution residue is
removed. Dry the spot by laying on a stack of paper towels weighted
down with a flat, heavy object such as a phone book.
</P>
<P>
   Most household stains will come up with one of the following
solutions, according to the Carpet and Rug Institute:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Dry-cleaning fluid: A nonflammable spot-removal liquid
available in grocery and hardware stores.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Nail-polish remover: A product containing amyl acetate sold
wherever you find cosmetics.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Detergent solution: Mix 1 cup water and 1 1/2 teaspoons of a
mild liquid detergent containing no lanolin or bleach.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Lukewarm tap water.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Ammonia solution: 2 tablespoons of household ammonia to 1 cup
of water.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Spot-removal kit: Available from retail carpet stores or
professional cleaners.
</P>
<P>
   The detergent solution is the first choice for most stains.
Start there when trying to remove alcoholic beverages, ketchup,
coffee or tea, most foods, fruit juices, mud, mustard, latex paint,
soft drinks, toothpaste, urine or vomit.
</P>
<P>
   Some oily stains may do better with dry-cleaning fluid. They
include butter, chocolate, grease, iodine, milk, oil and tar. For
chewing gum and crayons, freeze the stain with an ice cube and chip
away the excess before finishing the job with dry-cleaning fluid.
</P>
<P>
   Stains with waxes and dyes often come away with nail-polish
remover. Try it for candle wax, lipstick and other cosmetics,
solvent-based furniture polish, grass stains, ball-point pen marks
and nail polish.
</P>
<P>
   Try an ammonia solution in cool water for blood. The first
choice for rust stains is lukewarm water.
</P>
<P>
   Some spills contain chemicals that may discolor or even damage
the carpet fibers or dyes. If you have doubts about what caused the
spot and how to remove it, the Carpet Institute suggests you
contact a professional carpet cleaner.
</P>
<P>
   HERE'S THE DIRT ON UPHOLSTERY
</P>
<P>
   According to the Michigan State University Extension, the basic
process for cleaning upholstery is similar to the process for
carpets:
</P>
<P>
   Remove excess soil promptly by scraping off residue with a dull
knife or spoon and/or blotting up spills with absorbent materials.
</P>
<P>
   If you're using a cleaning agent, be sure to test it in an
inconspicuous spot. Furniture usually is marked with a sticker that
indicates how it should be cleaned.
</P>
<P>
   Tags marked ``W'' indicate you can spot clean with the foam only
of a water-based cleaning agent such as mild detergent or
upholstery shampoo. Try not to get the fabric too wet and dry it as
quickly and completely as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Cleaning stickers marked with an ``S'' should be spot cleaned
using cleaning solvent only. Use solvents sparingly in a
well-ventilated room. Contact furniture retailers for advice on
picking a cleaning solvent and read the directions carefully before
using.
</P>
<P>
   Furniture marked ``S-W'' may be cleaned with either solvent or
water-based foam.
</P>
<P>
   If the furniture is marked with an ``X,'' you should only vacuum
it and contact a professional cleaning company for stains.
</P>
<P>
   Other tips from Michigan State for cleaning upholstery include:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Do not remove the cushion from the cover while cleaning.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  For furniture that can be cleaned with water-based cleaners,
start with a pint of cool or lukewarm water and 2 teaspoons of mild
dish detergent. Swish the solution around to make suds and clean
with the suds.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  No harsh rubbing. Use a soft white cloth or a sponge. Rinse
with a damp sponge and encourage rapid drying by blotting excess
liquid with a dry cloth or paper towel.

 &HT;    Indicators of market for 2000 look good
 &HT;    By David McNaughton
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The stock market is a spindly looking thing, very tall
and very, very thin.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite gained 85.6 percent in 1999, but just a
handful of the thousands of stocks in that index accounted for most
of the rise. Among the stocks in the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index,
there were more losers than gainers last year.
</P>
<P>
   Does that concern money managers and investment strategists
going into this year? Yes, but not nearly enough to dash their
generally bullish outlook.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're probably looking at a good year,'' says money manager
Phillip M. Larkins of Legacy South in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The simple reason is that the fundamentals for stocks are still
good.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economy seems to be in good shape,'' says Joe Ransom of
Atlanta-based Trusco Capital Management. ``There are no
expectations of recession. We don't see any significant pickup in
inflation. Earnings ought to be good.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, an 8 percent rise in earnings for the S&AMP;P 500 companies
is a common forecast, although there are higher estimates.
Predictions for inflation-adjusted gross domestic product growth
run from 2.5 percent to 3.5 percent. Estimates of inflation this
year generally run from 1.5 percent to 2.5 percent, thanks in part
to expectations of continued gains in productivity.
</P>
<P>
   Even Georgia Tech's Fred Allvine, who scratches his head over
the stock market's torrid advance, makes this point: ``We have the
strongest economy in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Investment strategist John Lynch thinks the fundamentals will
translate into strong market gains early this year. Lynch, of
Wachovia Securities, has a two-pronged strategy for investors this
year. ``Get in early, and then be patient,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   He looks for a stronger-than-usual January effect, with a
bigger-than-usual slug of money being added to stocks early in the
year. Besides money moving from bonds to stocks, and the addition
of 401(k) dollars, there will be an influx of money that was on the
sidelines due to concern about the Year 2000 computer issue, Lynch
says.
</P>
<P>
   A few days before Christmas, he was predicting the Dow Jones
industrial average would reach 13,000 this year, the S&AMP;P 500 would
climb to 1,650 and the Nasdaq composite would touch 4,250.
</P>
<P>
   But most of the gains probably will come in the first six weeks
of the year, Lynch predicts.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm right with the surge I expect the first five or six
weeks, I think the Fed will raise (interest rates) in February, and
then there will be a trading range through the election,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   One of the things he thinks investors have overlooked is Federal
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's concern about the prices being
paid for stocks.
</P>
<P>
   He points in particular to a speech Greenspan made in August in
Jackson Hole, Wyo. In thats, Greenspan focused on the
problem of evaluating stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``The value ascribed to any asset is a discounted value of
future expected returns,'' the Fed chairman noted, and he suggested
that ``significant difficulties'' in accounting ``impede judgments
about prospective earnings.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan isn't the only market watcher with questions about the
current prices investors are willing to pay for stocks relative to
expected earnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do have to recognize we are entering 2000 with stocks
trading at exceptionally high valuation levels,'' says Larkins.
``What that tells us is that if something goes wrong ... there
could be a fairly violent reaction from the market.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The concern is, if the darlings were to stumble, do they drag
down the entire market, or would money from those stocks move into
some of the stocks that have lagged?'' adds Ransom.
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging the potential pitfalls in the market is not the
same as being down about the outlook, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that we are negative,'' says Ransom. ``We're just
sounding a cautionary note.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we are seeing one of the strangest markets in 40
years,'' says Allvine, who directs stock market research at Georgia
Tech. He cites negative factors such as the number of declining
stocks against advancing ones and the number of stocks hitting lows
vs. those hitting highs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certain high-cap tech stocks are pushing indexes higher, while
the average stock is treading water or going downward. A partial
explanation for this could be an Internet bubble or a new business
paradigm. I think the truth comes in between the two,'' Allvine
says.
</P>
<P>
   Allvine's stock market model has carried a ``sell'' signal since
May. The model has a pretty good track record and, in fact, given
that so many stocks lost ground last year, may have been right
again, Allvine says.
</P>
<P>
   But the market's performance, at least as measured by the major
indexes, is capable of producing some second-guessing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a smart time to add to your portfolio, but we
could be wrong,'' Allvine says.
</P>
<P>
   But if you're buying, here's what some money managers are
recommending:
</P>
<P>
   ``Know what you are buying, have reasonable expectations, and
establish a price you're willing to pay,'' says Ransom. He also
cautions against letting ``emotions get in the way of sound
judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   He notes that if investors are willing to look beyond the
big-capitalization stocks, they can find a number of companies with
good earnings. Among specific stocks, he likes Sysco, which
provides food services. ``It's a good quality company with a
reasonable valuation,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Given all the advertising that Internet-related companies are
doing, Ransom thinks the advertising sector might be worth a look
as well.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Woods, of Asset Preservation Advisors in Atlanta,
recommends a heavier weighting in bonds, particularly for older
investors. Contrary to a number of market professionals, he expects
the Fed to sit on the sidelines the first half of the year and the
yield on the 30-year Treasury to drop to 5.5 percent to 5.75
percent by the summer.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed is concerned about the growth of the economy, Woods
admits. But policy-makers also face the problem of not knowing how
much of this year's growth occurred early, in 1999, because of
concerns about the year 2000 issue, he adds.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a lot of anticipatory buying, by consumers and
businesses,'' Woods says.
</P>
<P>
   Like Woods, market strategist Robert S. Robbins of
Robinson-Humphrey has doubts the Fed will raise rates again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even should an additional Fed rate hike occur, the bond market
may begin to interpret such a move as inflation overkill, stemming
the rate rise,'' Robbins wrote in a research note late in December.
</P>
<P>
   However, in the same report, Robbins noted that interest rates
on the 30-year Treasury had risen more than he expected. That rise,
along with other factors, including the level of the stock market,
has increased the ``risks of a few percent correction,'' he wrote.
At the same time, Robbins predicted the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index
is headed for an 18 percent gain over the next year.
</P>
<P>
   Whether interest rates go up or down, they are still the key to
watch, according to Larkins.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably more than anything else, you need to keep your eye on
interest rates,'' he advises. ``If something spooks the bond
market, and we see the bond yield between 6.5 and 7 percent, then I
think we're going to be ripe for a correction.''
</P>
<P>
   A possible correction _ but not a bear market _ is on the minds
of a number of market analysts.
</P>
<P>
   But given the outlook for subdued inflation, more gains in
productivity, a strong domestic economy, and an improving global
economy, Larkins is still optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   Given where the market is, he thinks this might be the time to
``nibble'' at the small caps. But over the long haul, large-cap
stocks is where the average investor should be, he suggests. In
particular, big-cap stocks stand to benefit the most from
increasing growth outside the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``General Electric is a great large-cap company, and if it gets
clipped 20 percent in a bad market, the stock is still going to
come back,'' Larkins says.
</P>
<P>
   But for investors who have enjoyed good appreciation in their
stocks, it makes sense to move some money from stocks into bonds,
he suggests. As for stock selection, ``it may be good to move a
little into banking/finance,'' he adds.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever stocks interest you, Wachovia's Lynch has one last
piece of advice for investors watching the market:
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't get caught up in the day-to-day moves.''

   TECH-COATING _ The quest for better materials is ancient, but a
young Atlanta-grown company has made materials its high-tech
strength. MicroCoating Technologies, founded in the Georgia Tech
incubator in 1993 by native Atlantan, Andrew T. Hunt, is built on a
thin but sturdy patented coating. The thin coating is used to
construct electronic circuits, and is now being adapted to many
uses as diverse as fuel cells and solar instruments. The company
grew through ``bootstrapping,'' mainly through revenues but has
managed to double in size every year _ and has been profitable from

   WALKER-CHANGES _ ATLANTA _ Advocates of change believe a new
securities market is emerging that will be especially good for
individual investors, opening doors once closed to all but Wall

   PORTFOLIO-DRIPS _ ATLANTA _ Can you build a portfolio of

recently introduced an investment service that permits small
investors to dollar-cost-average their way into the shares of
companies _ such as Microsoft and Cisco Systems _ that don't offer
dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plans. DRIPs, as they are

 &HT;    Money managers appreciate Web for e-mail alerts to gossip
 &HT;    By Nisa Asokan

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Where do savvy fund managers, analysts and economists
go for information on the Internet?
</P>
<P>
   We asked some of them.
</P>
<P>
   _ Zack Shafran, manager of the Waddell &AMP; Reed United New
Concepts Fund, which has $1.4 billion in assets, is constantly on
the prowl for companies with products and services with bright
growth prospects. That often leads to investments in technology,
health care and consumer services companies.
</P>
<P>
   Change is a constant in those businesses. So Shafran relies on
the Internet to keep abreast of what's happening, not only in the
United States but overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Shafran keeps up with trends by reading financial newspapers
online. Among his favorites: The Financial Times,
www.financialtimes.com, for current company, country and industry
news and analysis; and Korea Times, www.koreatimes.co.kr, for its
computer industry and information technology section.
</P>
<P>
   He also reads the fee-based Wall Street Journal, www.wsj.com,
particularly for its technology coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Shafran also considers E-Commerce Times, www.ecommercetimes.com,
an excellent source of technology news. It also offers original
editorials and special reports on hot topics in e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Shafran finds Standard &AMP; Poor's index service,
www.spglobal.com, helpful for measuring investment performance and
getting an understanding of the markets.
</P>
<P>
   _ Perry Walker, telecommunications analyst at Robinson-Humphrey,
takes advantage of the e-mail alerts provided by Company Sleuth,
www.companysleuth.com, which monitors chat pages, federal court
filings and general research on the companies he's following.
Company Sleuth will track up to 10 publicly traded companies' every
move including insider trades, rumors and analyst ratings.
</P>

 &HT;    Frugal investors have larger selection of stocks
 &HT;    By Robert Luke
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Can you build a portfolio of technology stocks on a
shoestring budget?
</P>
<P>
   Now you can.
</P>
<P>
   Two firms recently introduced an investment service that permits
small investors to dollar-cost-average their way into the shares of
companies _ such as Microsoft and Cisco Systems _ that don't offer
dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plans.
</P>
<P>
   DRIPs, as they are known, are a popular way for investors
without large sums of cash to build stakes in the more than 1,200
companies that offer them.
</P>
<P>
   DRIP participants not only can acquire more shares with their
dividends, they also can make additional cash purchases _ as little
as $10 each time _ with modest, if any, fees or commissions.
</P>
<P>
   Now, buyandhold.com and Netstock Direct extend that ability to
the shares of companies that don't have DRIPs.
</P>
<P>
   Under buyandhold.com's program, which began in November,
investors can buy and sell stocks online at a cost of $2.99. The
transactions are made twice daily. Individuals can invest as little
as $20 each time.
</P>
<P>
   There are no annual administrative fees.
</P>
<P>
   Netstock Direct's automatic investment program, ShareBuilder,
charges $2 per purchase. The cost per transaction on accounts for
children under 18 is $1.
</P>
<P>
   Purchases are made once a week. There are no minimums. Investors
can specify how often they want to purchase shares _ once a week,
monthly or quarterly, for example. Amounts are automatically
debited from checking or savings accounts.
</P>
<P>
   The fee for real-time purchases and sales is $19.95.
</P>
<P>
   Inactive accounts _ those with no transactions for a year _ are
charged $12.
</P>
<P>
   At both firms, both full and fractional shares are purchased
with each investment.
</P>
<P>
   Both also provide online statements, making record-keeping easy.
The statements keep track of the cost basis of purchases for tax
purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Details of the investment programs are available at
www.buyandhold.com and www.sharebuilder
</P>
<P>
   .com.

 &HT;    Technology moved Wall Street from start
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Internet revolution is just the latest in a long
history of technology-driven changes on Wall Street, the most
important of which were designed to speed the flow of information.
</P>
<P>
   It started with plain old foot power _ literally _ in the 1790s,
when Wall Street began to emerge as an important market for
financial trading.
</P>
<P>
   Runners, as the mostly adolescent messengers were called, hoofed
it back and forth between the stock exchange and the brokers'
nearby offices.
</P>
<P>
   Since information traveled so slowly, New York did not have the
special advantage it has today. Every major city had its own
financial market.
</P>
<P>
   The first technological breakthrough designed to link exchanges
in different cities occurred around the turn of the 19th century,
when a line of semaphores was established between New York and
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Men, stationed on hills and tall buildings within telescopic
range of each other, used flag signals to transmit the latest
prices between cities.
</P>
<P>
   The next advance came when Samuel Morse demonstrated a
successful telegraph line between Baltimore and Washington in 1844.
</P>
<P>
   That way, financial data could be transmitted almost as quickly
as it can today, and the network eventually connected every major
U.S. city.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street, incidentally, was merely the biggest of many big
exchanges as late as the 1840s. Philadelphia, Boston or other
cities might easily have been the future center of securities
trading.
</P>
<P>
   But by the time of the Civil War, and to a large extent because
of it, Wall Street began to assume the role it has today. One
reason was that it was more efficient for the big brokers and
traders to locate close to each other and close to the stock
exchange.
</P>
<P>
   In 1867, Edward A. Calahan invented the stock ticker, which
outdid the telegraph as a mechanism for transmitting stock price
information automatically and continuously. The ticker printed the
share prices on a continuous strip of paper _ ticker tape _ making
it possible for brokers and investors to know what the market was
doing minute-by-minute.
</P>
<P>
   In 1878, the New York Stock Exchange installed its first
telephone, just two years after Alexander Graham Bell first
demonstrated the device. The number of phones increased rapidly as
brokers realized its value in sending buy and sell orders and
receiving confirmations.
</P>
<P>
   These advances boosted stock market volume from thousand-share
days in the 1850s to the first million-share day on Dec. 15, 1886.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of technology, this was about where the market stood
for most of the 20th century. But a number of non-technical changes
affected trading.
</P>
<P>
   The growth of institutional trading in the 1960s significantly
accelerated stock exchange volumes, which, for example, exceeded 6
million shares per day in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   Overall stock trading increased when many institutions turned to
the so-called over-the-counter market, where they could make
transactions in unlisted stocks without going to the NYSE floor.
</P>
<P>
   The OTC market began to compete successfully with the Big Board
as a result. Nothing like this had happened since the 1860s. Even
the regional stock exchanges resumed some of their importance as
places where institutions handled large block trades.
</P>
<P>
   The computer era dawned on Wall Street in 1971, when the Nasdaq
_ the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated
Quotation system _ went into operation.
</P>
<P>
   Before Nasdaq was set up by the National Association of
Securities Dealers _ a self-regulating securities organization _
OTC brokers had to phone each market maker to find the best stock
prices.
</P>
<P>
   Now, thanks to the computer terminal, the broker could look at a
monitor, pick the best price and make the trade. Nasdaq also made
it possible for institutional investors to trade listed stocks off
the floor of the Big Board more easily.
</P>
<P>
   This looked like the end of Wall Street for sure, or at least
the end of the NYSE, according to John Steele Gordon, author of
``The Great Game: The Emergence of Wall Street as a World Power.''
</P>
<P>
   That's when another non-technological change had the effect of
coming to Wall Street's rescue by promoting investment activity.
</P>
<P>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission forced the NYSE to end
fixed commissions on stock trades, a move that increased the
competitiveness of the brokerage business and brought prices down
for investors.
</P>
<P>
   Congress also mandated the creation of a national marketing
system _ the Intermarket Trading System _ that linked all the
nation's exchanges and Nasdaq, so that traders could find the best
prices instantly regardless of where in the country the prices were
to be found. The ITS began in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said those two reforms were intended to break Wall
Street's monopoly in the trading of securities by making it easier
for investors to trade in any market where they could find the best
price.
</P>
<P>
   The Big Board responded in 1981 by installing a computerized
display system on its trading floor, benefiting the floor brokers
and specialists.
</P>
<P>
   Another non-technological event _ a Nasdaq trading scandal _
prompted the SEC to impose new trading rules in 1997 relating to
the way dealers handle customer ``limit orders'' _ an investor's
request to buy or sell shares at a certain price. They contrast
with a ``market order,'' or request to buy or sell at the best
available price.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts cite these new rules as one reason enterprising traders
developed computerized ``electronic communications networks,'' or
ECNs. Now, limit orders can be matched automatically by computer.

 &HT;    Technology, competition open markets to masses
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Claude Paquin doesn't care for the term ``trading,''
as it applies to buying and selling stocks via home computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It suggests a pleasurable pastime like trading baseball cards
in the old days, or Pokemon cards today, rather than the serious
business of investing and participating in the economic growth of
the country,'' says Paquin, a 59-year-old Fayetteville, Ga.,
resident.
</P>
<P>
   Without intending to do so, Paquin _ a retired actuary and
lawyer _ is participating in a revolution that is sweeping through
the canyons of Wall Street, changing age-old habits and methods of
buying and selling shares of U.S. and foreign corporations.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates of change believe a new securities market is emerging
that will be especially good for individual investors, opening
doors once closed to all but Wall Street insiders, while slashing
the cost of trading.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome of this turmoil will decide nothing less than the
process by which investors buy and sell stocks and other securities
in the future, and how the institutions that handle the trading do
their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The revolution results from two historic developments. One is
the expansion of individual investing via mutual funds, 401(k)s and
other retirement plans. The second is the advent of the Internet,
which has brought the stock market into the very homes of
individual investors.
</P>
<P>
   Hardly unique
</P>
<P>
   William Combs' experience is not unusual.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prior to 1997, I seldom traded stocks,'' said Combs, 61, a
retired Internal Revenue Service auditor and investigator. ``My dad
left me a few shares of BellSouth, which I held for about three
years and sold for a nice profit. That gave me `the bug.' In 1997,
I became much more active in the market and became a short-term
investor.''
</P>
<P>
   Multiply Combs' experience by the thousands and clearly the term
``revolution'' is not too strong to suggest the nature of the
changes on the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, a lot has already occurred, much of it in 1999, and the
view from within the securities industry is that greater changes
lie ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``2000 will be the pivotal year,'' said Robert C. King,
executive vice president and director of over-the-counter trading
at Robinson-Humphrey in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once Y2K is out of the way, the Nasdaq market will move as
early as February or March to make major changes. And it will
continue all year,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq market _ a computerized network of broker-dealers who
work with clients on a one-on-one basis _ has lost a big chunk of
business to online trading. Now the computer is moving against the
very citadel of American capitalism, the New York Stock Exchange.
Traditions and practices dating to the beginning of the market are
under threat.
</P>
<P>
   In self-defense, Wall Street powerhouses such as Merrill Lynch _
which alone employs 14,000 registered representatives _ are
allowing some customers to trade stocks over the Internet,
bypassing the registered representative and those representatives'
commissions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are all feeling for new signposts, new boundaries,'' J.P.
Morgan Chairman and Chief Executive Douglas A. Warner III said in a
speech last fall.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to think of the revolution is to visualize the
stock-trading process as a three-way deal with a buyer on one side,
the marketplace in the middle and a seller on the other side. The
battleground, clearly, is in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   Middlemen involved
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally an investor goes through a broker, or other
middleman, to buy or sell shares of stock, for which the broker
earns a commission.
</P>
<P>
   If the stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange, there are
even more middlemen, including floor brokers and specialists. A
trade on the Nasdaq market is simplified in that the Nasdaq is a
computerized network of broker-dealers.
</P>
<P>
   But if an investor had some way to get into the marketplace
directly, it would be possible to buy and sell stock without the
complex system of middlemen _ or at least not as many _ thus
lowering trading costs.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, and greatly oversimplified, that is what the personal
computer makes possible.
</P>
<P>
   As Paquin sees it, online trading gives the individual investor
far more choices _ as many as 8,000 common stocks. In the old days,
a broker phoned to offer a yes-or-no option on the latest stock
being touted.
</P>
<P>
   The new systems that are emerging won't completely rid the
marketplace of middlemen. If anything, computerized trading has
established a new kind of middleman, the ``electronic
communications network,'' or ECN, to handle trades. The ECN
electronically matches buyers and sellers of stocks, the job
traditionally done by brokers.
</P>
<P>
   It's not hard to see how this wipes out whole cadres of
traditional middlemen and why Wall Street's established
institutions aren't going down without a fight.
</P>
<P>
   But to the extent that everybody recognizes the inevitability of
some degree of change, the brokers, markets and related
institutions have joined the change parade in hopes of leading it
instead of being trampled by it.
</P>
<P>
   A lot has already happened:
</P>
<P>
   _ The ECNs have already absorbed about a third of all Nasdaq
transactions as well as a smaller, but growing, segment of the New
York Stock Exchange volume.
</P>
<P>
   _ The New York Stock Exchange is developing an electronic
trading process of its own, although limited initially to small
orders. The Nasdaq market, meanwhile, is building a centralized
trading system that will do what the ECNs do.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Nasdaq market already has extended its price reporting
beyond the 4 p.m. close to accommodate online traders who work at
home at night.
</P>
<P>
   _ Both the Nasdaq and the NYSE are contemplating public stock
offerings, not only to raise money needed to finance their changes
but also to restructure the business side of the marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   _ In the regulatory field, Congress has repealed the
Depression-era Glass-Steagall Act that separated investment banking
from commercial banking and insurance. This is expected to
facilitate new mergers and financial combinations aimed at
increased competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
   _ In July, the 200-year-old practice of trading shares in
fractions will yield to decimal pricing. This will cut even more
into the spreads between offering and buying prices _ and therefore
into broker profits as well.
</P>
<P>
   While elimination of fractional pricing is not directly related
to the computer, King believes this change will have ``the biggest
impact'' on the market, at least in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   It means the spreads between buy and sell offering prices will
shrink to as low as 1 cent, vs. the current 6 1/4 cents for a
quotation of one-sixteenth, or even 1 1/2 cents for a
one-sixty-fourth quote.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these changes have been in the works for years _ the
Glass-Steagall repeal, for instance; others, such as ECNs, have
descended on the market only in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows how far the changes will go, but to the extent that
the computer bypasses many traditional steps in the investing
process, some of the oldest institutions on Wall Street are under
attack.
</P>
<P>
   One of them is the trading floor of the New York Stock Exchange,
where floor brokers of major securities firms interact with the
specialists whose job is to make an orderly market in common
stocks.
</P>
<P>
   This ``shout-and-scream'' system is one of the most famous
images on Wall Street, although the process has been calmed by the
advent of computers and video stock quotation machines on the
trading floor.
</P>
<P>
   King, for one, believes the Big Board's auction system will not
survive ``if trading is opened up to everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately this becomes a multiple-dealer market,'' he said,
which contrasts with the exclusivity of the NYSE's specialist
system.
</P>
<P>
   As for why this is happening now, analysts say it is not just
the computer and its various advances. Some analysts see it as a
battle for market share between a group of upstart but
technologically advanced organizations and the Wall Street
establishment, including the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
   But the advocates of change are getting some high-level help.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Levitt, chairman of the regulatory Securities and
Exchange Commission, has been a cheerleader for changing Wall
Street's brokerage firms, pressuring and prodding them to deal with
the new market.
</P>
<P>
   Levitt told The Wall Street Journal that he hopes the Big Board
``will become more aware of the economic realities and the
interests of investors.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If not,'' Levitt added, ``there's a very real chance that
within a short period of time (the NYSE) could lose a substantial
share of (its) market and never be able to regain it.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say these market changes are motivated by competitive
pressures to cut costs and to maneuver for positions of power
within the new trading system.
</P>
<P>
   To the extent that the New York Stock Exchange is the
institution most threatened by this revolution, these changes have
been likened to the breakup of AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   Cumbersome system
</P>
<P>
   The Big Board's dominance of the stock market is by no means as
extensive as AT&AMP;T's one-time monopoly over long-distance phone
traffic.
</P>
<P>
   But to the extent that brokerage commissions and other
transaction costs are kept high by a cumbersome, outmoded system,
there is a resemblance to the phone rates that were kept
artificially high by AT&AMP;T's monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   Online trading has already burgeoned because of cheaper
transaction costs, and this is clearly the impetus behind the
explosive expansion of ECNs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can buy and sell at a greatly reduced commission costs,
like 90 percent to 95 percent less,'' says Paquin.
</P>
<P>
   Most online trading is done on the Nasdaq market, since it is
already a computerized system of dealers and not an auction market
such as the New York Stock Exchange. That also means that Big
Board-listed stocks cannot be traded on Nasdaq, and vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   To get around this exclusivity, some analysts envision the
eventual development of a central electronic ``limit order book,''
where buy and sell orders will be executed automatically regardless
of the market from which the order originates.
</P>
<P>
   A ``limit order'' is an investor's request to buy or sell shares
of stock at a price that must be honored by the broker. A ``market
order'' asks the broker to buy or sell at the best available price.
A limit order can be executed automatically, assuming that a buy
order happens to be matched by a sell order at the same price.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of this proposal say it would eventually eliminate the
separate markets, since all orders would have to go to the central
book. This, in turn, would diminish competition, not enhance it, it
is charged.
</P>
<P>
   Nasdaq officials say this is already happening in Europe, where
the various national markets are being centralized in the European
Union.
</P>
<P>
   So far, at least, the SEC indicates that it is not willing to go
that far on Wall Street. While nothing is settled, analysts believe
that means the SEC will approve multiple order books that
specialize in different stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Goldman Sachs Chairman Henry Paulson stunned his
peers at last fall's meeting of the Securities Industry Association
by calling for a central electronic trading system that could be
independent of the NYSE and Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
   He argued that the structure of the U.S. trading system is too
important for the exchanges to decide matters for themselves. This
put Paulson on the side of the SEC's Levitt as an advocate of
dramatic change.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts see at least four developments in the near future
leading to a revamped market:
</P>
<P>
   _ Creation of an independent agency that would assume all the
regulatory functions of the industry, modeled after the current
National Association of Securities Dealers, founder of the Nasdaq
Stock Market.
</P>
<P>
   _ Elimination by the SEC of New York Stock Exchange Rule 390,
which prohibits NYSE issues from being traded in other markets.
NYSE directors have already authorized the change.
</P>
<P>
   _ IPOs, or public stock offerings, for both the Big Board and
Nasdaq, converting them into for-profit organizations. They now
operate as associations, where a consensus among so many members is
hard to come by.
</P>
<P>
   _ Creation of a central limit order book that would link the Big
Board, Nasdaq, regional stock exchanges and the various ECNs.
</P>
<P>
   While these changes pose a threat to the Big Board and the
Nasdaq in their current forms, they are also regarded as a threat
to the traditional retail brokers, who are already losing customers
to online trading and discount brokers.
</P>
<P>
   This helps account for the defensive moves made last year by
Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Salomon Smith
Barney _ who alone account for about a third of Big Board volume.
They have invested in ECNs and are pushing hard for some form of
automated trading.
</P>
<P>
   The brokers argue that some of these changes will be slower than
advocates allege, because executing trades is not the sole purpose
of dealing with a stockbroker.
</P>
<P>
   Brokers help their clients select stocks and avoid hazards. The
financial analysts attached to brokerage firms provide research
that can help an investor decide which stock to buy or sell.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the day you still have to have professional
securities people who know what is happening to survive,'' said
King.
</P>
<P>
   In sum, the broker acts as a de facto investment adviser for
clients, according to this view.
</P>
<P>
   Turned loose, the individual investor may very well save money
on commissions or other transaction costs but lose his or her shirt
making the wrong judgment.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a market like today, it is very easy to think that one can
always achieve high rates of return and we know that is not
likely,'' says individual investor John Reicher, a Dunwoody
resident and retired certified public accountant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am 53 years old and have watched the markets for many
years,'' he says. ``But younger people who are just starting out
with investing could be in for a real scare when the markets go
down if they control all of their investments.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Paquin, the very ease of online trading ``may be a
temptation for some investors to flitter from flower to flower,
never investigating enough and never staying invested in a given
stock long enough to maximize their ultimate reward.''
</P>
<P>
   Many individuals have the savvy, experience and self-discipline
needed, but many _ perhaps most _ do not.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the advocates of caution argue, they see nothing in the
new scheme of things that provides this service to the investor _
except, perhaps, the old-fashioned stockbroker.

WINNERS CIRCLED FOR THIS YEAR'S ECLIPSE 
</HEADLINE>

   The Eclipse Awards winners will be announced Jan. 17 at the
awards dinner to be held at the Beverly Hills Hilton. Here's a look
at one turf writer's ballot:
</P>
<P>
   --Two-year-old colt: Anees. This one was close between Anees,
who won the Breeders' Cup Juvenile at 30-1, and Greenwood Lake, who
took the Champagne and Remsen, but was held out of the Breeders'
Cup. The vote went to Anees because he was the only horse to win
against the inside, speed-bias on the Gulfstream Park strip during
the Breeders' Cup card. Anees came from 14th and last to tally with
ease. The Breeders' Cup was first run in 1984, and no Juvenile
winner has ever won the Kentucky Derby. It will be interesting to
follow the progress of Anees, who is beautifully bred (by
Unbridled, out of an Alydar mare).
</P>
<P>
   --Two-year-old filly: Chilukki. It may well be that Surfside,
who ran a troubled third in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies, is
better at a distance of ground, but you can't argue with Chilukki's
record. She won six straight, including five stakes, beat males (in
the Kentucky Breeders' Cup), and finished second in the Breeders'
Cup to Cash Run, who was aided by the speed bias.
</P>
<P>
   --Three-year-old colt: Charismatic. A former claimer,
Charismatic won the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness before
breaking down in the Belmont while making a gallant effort to win
the Triple Crown. Charismatic was just 4 for 10 on the season, but
deserves the award on heart alone.
</P>
<P>
   --Three-year-old filly: Silverbulletday. She went over the top
in the Breeders' Cup Distaff, finishing sixth, but was 8 for 8
against rivals of her own age and gender. She can be forgiven for
her ill-conceived outing vs. males in the Belmont (finishing
seventh).
</P>
<P>
   --Turf male: Daylami. The winner of the Breeders' Cup Turf, now
retired, was a true star.
</P>
<P>
   --Turf female: Soaring Softly. Won 7 for 8, including the
inaugural running of the Breeders' Cup Filly &AMP; Mare Turf. She
stands alone.
</P>
<P>
   --Handicap male: Behrens. This category could easily have gone
to Victory Gallop, now retired, who was unbeaten in the United
Stsates at 3 for 3, and defeated Behrens by a nose in the Whitney.
However, Victory Gallop (whose only loss this year came in Dubai)
didn't race after Aug. 1, and won only one Grade I race. Behrens
flopped in the Breeders' Cup Classic (seventh), but had been either
first or second in eight stakes (8-4-4-0) and won two Grade I
races. If Behrens takes the award it will mean that the winner of
the Massachusetts Handicap at Suffolk Downs has been voted handicap
champion five years in a row (Cigar twice, Skip Away twice).
</P>
<P>
   --Handicap female: Beautiful Pleasure. She was sensational
winning three straight Grade I races on the front end and closing
the year with a game score in the Breeders' Cup Distaff. Banshee
Breeze is a tough luck loser here. She always gave her best
(7-4-3-0), and tried so hard to catch Beautiful Pleasure in the
Distaff (missing by less than a length) that she almost collapsed
in the unsaddling area from heat exhaustion.
</P>
<P>
   --Sprinter: Artax. Nobody was better when he was on. He won only
4 of 15 starts, but he broke track records established by Dr. Fager
and Groovy in New York, and tied Mr. Prospector's 1:07 4/5 for six
furlongs while winning the Breeders' Cup Sprint.
</P>
<P>
   Steeplechase: Ninepins. This 12-year-old son of Nijinsky won
just one race all year, but that was the Breeders' Cup Grand
National, and it was by a margin of 22 lengths. That's good enough
for this voter.
</P>
<P>
   --Horse of Year: Daylami. Daylami was not only the Horse of the
Year off one race in the United States (which makes him eligible),
but also was the Horse of the World.
</P>
<P>
   --Outstanding owner: Frank Stronach. While Stronach was busy
buying racetracks, his horses won $6 million in purse money.
</P>
<P>
   --Outstanding trainer: Bob Baffert. Baffert was humbled at the
Breeders' Cup (0 for 8), but that didn't detract from a great year
overall, which saw his charges win more than $15 million. Nobody,
not even D. Wayne Lukas ($12 million), came close.
</P>
<P>
   --Outstanding jockey: Jorge Chavez. This award could just as
easily go to Jerry Bailey, who has won the past two years, or Pat
Day. But Chavez was right there with them in money won (around $17
million) and is long overdue for some recognition.
</P>
<P>
   --Outstanding apprentice jockey: Ariel Smith. Smith won $3
million in purses in New York and may have a future.

JETS' MANEUVER BOXES OUT PATRIOTS ON BELICHICK FRONT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe

<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ In the end, Pete Carroll drowned in his own
humanity.
</P>
<P>
   It may seem absurd in the real world to say he was too nice a
man for the business he chose, but it really is as simple as that.
So when he took his leave Monday after being fired by Patriots
owner Bob Kraft a day after his third season as head coach ended
with a 20-3 victory over the Baltimore Ravens, Carroll did as he
had done since the first day he arrived.
</P>
<P>
   He acted and reacted with dignity, which is something that had
been in short supply around the Patriots' front office the past
week. At 12:15 p.m., after addressing his former players and
coaches, Carroll walked out of the Patriots' offices at Foxboro
Stadium and headed toward a horde of media trapped behind iron
barriers in the parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   Barely an hour earlier, Kraft had tersely announced his decision
to fire Carroll, needing just four sentences to dismiss him after
the Patriots failed to reach the playoffs for the first time in
Carroll's three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I must say up front he is someone I have great respect for,''
said Kraft. ``But this is a business of accountablity, and two
years ago we won the division, last year we barely made the
playoffs, and this year we're 8-8.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need a momentum change. Is it solely Pete Carroll's fault?
No, I think we have to reassess the whole organization.''
</P>
<P>
   With that Kraft was gone, refusing to take any questions. That's
because he was a man without any answers Monday.
</P>
<P>
   He had just fired someone he claimed to admire deeply and soon
enough may be doing the same with personnel director Bobby Grier.
If this truly is a business of accountability and not one of
scapegoating, he has no choice.
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, is also part of the problem because he also has
no choices now that Bill Belichick has been installed as the new
coach of the New York Jets despite unsubstantiated reports that
Belichick is upset about not being free to explore the
possibilities in New England.
</P>
<P>
   If Belichick is upset, he's not as upset as Kraft, who spent the
day with his advisers trying to figure out which direction to turn.
</P>
<P>
   This led Kraft to Denver offensive coordinator/quarterbacks
coach Gary Kubiak, whom the Patriots have gotten permission to talk
to, but that may just be the tip of a large iceberg because Kubiak
has no head coaching experience and has not even been a true
coordinator in Denver, where the offense is designed and run by
head coach Mike Shanahan.
</P>
<P>
   While this was going on inside the building, Carroll walked up
to a makeshift battery of microphones and told a wall of reporters,
``I'm proud of being 27-21 and making the playoffs the first two
years I was here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll forever be disappointed that we didn't win more.''
</P>
<P>
   Carroll went on to speak briefly about new challenges and new
beginnings, and then he did what few men being fired do. He walked
from the podium toward the crowd and took the time to shake the
hands of those media members he knew best, even some of his most
severe critics.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not he was the right man for the job was no longer at
issue. That had been settled by Kraft, and what was nog
through was what anyone who had paid attention always knew about
him. Pete Carroll may not be a man for all seasons, but he surely
is a class act and someone whose life is centered on things bigger
than football.
</P>
<P>
   The latter probably was part of the reason he never quite seemed
able to become the tyrant needed for success as an NFL head coach,
but as he drove off in his Jaguar, he seemed at peace, which was
more than could be said for the men he left behind.
</P>
<P>
   Through all of this turmoil Monday, Grier was silent and unseen.
Some readers of the Patriots' tea leaves speculated that this meant
he would soon be out of power as well. The fact that it was Kraft
publicly sacking Carroll rather than Grier meant to some that
Grier's would be the next head to roll, and the fact that the
Patriots faxed a request to Jets president Steve Gutman asking to
talk to Belichick about coming to New England as coach and general
manager only enhanced the sense of foreboding.
</P>
<P>
   Grier badly hurt himself last week when he went on local radio
and television and accused Carroll and his staff of not properly
using the young talent he had hand-picked for them, and word from
some corners of the NFL was that Kraft was trying to talk with
Bears personnel director Mark Hatley and ex-Chiefs head coach Marty
Schottenheimer about coming in as a tandem to take over the
football operation.
</P>
<P>
   They worked together in Kansas City and remain good friends, and
Schottenheimer, who resigned from the Chiefs after last season, has
one of the league's best records in recent years. The problem with
that scenario is that Schottenheimer is working for ESPN, has told
friends he has no interest in returning to coaching next year, and
would cost the Patriots some high draft picks in compensation
because he is still under contract to the Chiefs.
</P>
<P>
   Hatley, meanwhile, may be close to signing a contract extension
in Chicago. As of early Monday night, the Bears had not been
contacted by the Patriots about Hatley, a well-respected personnel
man, who is a holdover from a defunct regime in Chicago and
admittedly has been fighting for months to get an extension from
new club president Ted Phillips.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Hatley might consider a move into a position of more
authority, and Kraft conceded that an organizational restructuring
may be necessary after his team drifted downhill under the
triple-headed monster he created after Bill Parcells's departure.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll was brought in to coach the team while Grier would
handle personnel and Andy Wasynczuk would manage the salary cap.
There was supposed to be an overlap of authority and flexibility,
but Carroll had to wait several months just to get a new carpet for
his office approved by Wasynczuk, and he and his coaches have had
little say in personnel matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what they intend to do here, but they'll never
win with the structure the way it is,'' said an assistant coach.
``If they think firing Pete and getting rid of us is the answer,
they're sadly mistaken. The problem is in the organization.''
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Kraft toyed with the idea of bringing in former
Raiders head coach and present Falcons line coach Art Shell to be
assistant head coach and sit as a possible replacement for Carroll.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll was opposed to this, and Shell had no interest in being
a paid assassin, so the idea never got past the talking stage.
Shell has not been approached by anyone in the organization this
year, which may reflect on Grier's possibly diminished powers or
the Falcons' failures this year, or may simply be because Atlanta
was playing Monday night and hence Shell was technically off limits
for another 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   As the flirtation with Belichick faded (although some will tell
you it's not quite extinguished), the Patriots stood without a
leader and with no clear view of where to find one. All Bob Kraft
knew by day's end was what his players knew before Carroll even
told them of his dismissal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need a leader,'' said cornerback Ty Law. ``No doubt about
it. We can't do it on our talent alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Not even Bobby Grier can dispute that anymore.

   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone: When her baby is born, the teen-age girl
won't be able to hold it. That's because after the rebels raped and
impregnated her, they hacked off her arms at the elbow with a
machete. If you could see face to face the darkness of human
madness wrought on these people, your heart would ache into your
sleep. I was a Peace Corps volunteer in Sierra Leone from 1962-64,
during that nation's heady years of early independence from Great
Britain. I knew these people as kind, loving and industrious; I
never imagined the nightmare that would eat the nation alive. Nor
did I ever expect to return there, especially after the last decade
of coups and fighting. But life has its pulls and patterns.

A NEW LOOK AT THE DRIVING FORCE OF MOTOWN 
</HEADLINE>

DANCING IN THE STREET 
Motown and the Cultural Politics of Detroit 
By Suzanne E. Smith 
Harvard University Press, 319 pp., illustrated, $24.95 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With an $800 loan from his family, Berry Gordy Jr. forever
changed the style and sound of American popular music.
</P>
<P>
   In 1958, Gordy, a one-time boxer and automobile assembly-line
worker, founded Motown Records. At its zenith, Motown was the
creative home of such artists as the Supremes, the Temptations, the
Four Tops, Stevie Wonder, Gladys Knight and the Pips, Marvin Gaye,
Smokey Robinson and the Miracles, Martha Reeves and the Vandellas,
and the Jackson 5.
</P>
<P>
   Promoted as ``The Sound of Young America,'' Motown's music, and
success, have long held a particular resonance for black America,
especially in Detroit, their birthplace,even though the company
relocated to Los Angeles more than a quarter-century ago.
</P>
<P>
   Since Gordy set up ``Hitsville U.S.A.'' in a small house on West
Grand Boulevard, much has been written and said about Motown: its
crossover success with white audiences, its legacy as the
soundtrack for a era, and an evergreen popularity underlined by the
use of its songs in everything from hip-hop samples to television
commercials.
</P>
<P>
   But few have examined the company's rise within the turbulent
cultural-political context of Detroit in the 1950s and '60s. In her
scholarly, informative ``Dancing in the Street,'' Suzanne E. Smith
reconsiders Motown not just as the background music of the city's
struggles, but as an integral component of black Detroit's march
for civil rights and social justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Throughout the 1960s, Motown and the other cultural work of
black Detroit offered not only a symbol of what was possible, but
also a means to empower the city's often embattled African-American
community,'' she writes. Motown ``emerged from a city in which
African-Americans felt they had little influence over white power
structures and within an economy that was wholly dependent on the
patterns and fluctuations of the auto industry. Given these
circumstances, the remarkable rise of a company that was black
owned and whose product _ music _ was independent of the auto
industry demands further examination.''
</P>
<P>
   By the late 1950s, Detroit had the nation's fourth-largest black
community, and one of its most restless and discontented. Hundreds
of thousands had migrated to the city in the war years in search of
better jobs and lives, but they were often met with the same
discrimination they had fled in the segregated South. In 1943, the
tensions exploded in riots that left 34 people dead. Four years
later, the city established its devastating Detroit Plan, which
called for the purchase and demolition of properties in
disenfranchised neighborhoods. By 1953, more than 2,000 black
families had been displaced, and in the Motor City, urban renewal
became known as ``Negro removal.''
</P>
<P>
   From this turmoil was born Motown Records. Gordy was the son of
a successful black businessman who migrated from rural Georgia to
Detroit in 1922, and instilled in his eight children the black
self-help doctrines of Booker T. Washington. That drive led the
younger Gordy to abandon his $86.40-a-week job as an upholstery
trimmer on a Ford assembly line and to pursue a career in the music
industry.
</P>
<P>
   The company's first hit, Barrett Strong's ``Money (That's What I
Want),'' perfectly captured Gordy's ambitions, and showed black
Detroit that there were opportunities beyond the monotony of the
assembly lines. And although Gordy was often wary of overtly
political songs (especially during Motown's nascent years), by 1963
Motown's music ``was emanating from radio waves and turntables
across the country and challenging the racial categories that the
music industry imposed upon it,'' Smith writes. The company's
success also encouraged others who thought of starting self-reliant
black-owned businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Combining ``black entrepreneurial achievement with a culturally
resonant product,'' Smith writes, Motown ``was destined to become a
vibrant and contested symbol of African-American accomplishment as
Detroit _ along with the rest of the country _ confronted the
racial politics of the early civil rights years.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, a history professor at George Mason University, can be a
bit dry and stodgy at times. But she best connects with her
subject's energy in re-creations of seminal moments such as Stevie
Wonder's performance of ``Fingertips, Part 2'' at Chicago's Regal
Theater, which was captured live, and which became Wonder's first
hit. She has an obvious reverence for the music; most of the book's
chapters are headed by famous song titles. And the book takes its
name from the soul chestnut by Martha Reeves and the Vandellas, and
is a prime example of Smith's thesis. When ``Dancing in the
Street'' was first released in the 1960s, some heard the song for
what it probably had been intended to be _ a hip-shaking,
let's-get-this-party-started anthem. Others, however, interpreted
it as a clarion call for black America to riot.
</P>
<P>
   Years later, Reeves maintained, ``My Lord, it was a party
song.'' But in years rife with social upheaval and racial unrest,
even an innocuous party song could seem to be weighted with hidden,
revolutionary meaning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Music, particularly music created in Detroit's black community
during the 1960s, could rarely if ever transcend the politically
and racially charged environment in which it was produced,'' Smith
writes. ``The sounds, music, and `dancing' that emerged from the
streets of black Detroit reflected and directly engaged with the
challenges African-Americans faced as they built their lives in a
major industrial city. A song such as `Dancing in the Street' was
only one example of how music in Detroit's black community
constituted daily life rather than acted as a diversion from it.''

POLITICAL BATTLE OF THE AIRWAVES IS TURNING GENTLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES A. RADIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ON ROUTE 101, N.H. _ Amidships on his campaign bus, during a
recent swing through the first-primary state, Senator John McCain
was conducting what aides call the press conference that never
ends.
</P>
<P>
   Talking casually, on the record, with a ceaseless stream of
reporters and editorialists, the Arizona Republican sympathized
with the Rwandans, poked fun at the French, and returned
relentlessly to his mantra: For campaign finance reform. Against
special interests.
</P>
<P>
   Squeezed into a back corner of the bus, media strategist Mike
Murphy _ who offers a three-word summary of campaign strategy
(``offense, offense, offense'') _ plugged a wireless modem into the
side of his laptop computer and tried to distract himself with
e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``My handler instincts are to be all over this,'' Murphy said,
looking toward the prolonged, uncontrolled contact between
candidate and media. ``Every time I see . . . the pens whip out, my
adrenalin kind of runs up a little. I've got to Zen away from it.''
</P>
<P>
   Murphy is hardly alone: There's a lot of Zen in the art of
candidate maintenance in New Hampshire these days.
</P>
<P>
   In a campaign dominated so far by the rising tide of support for
McCain and Bill Bradley, and by voter demands for ``authenticity''
in candidates, the traditional tools of political tradecraft _
message management, polling, attack advertising, and the like _
have been relegated to the back of the bus, if they are spoken of
at all.
</P>
<P>
   This tonal shift has been particularly noticeable on the
airwaves. As of mid-December, the candidates had already poured
more than $4 million into over 1,000 minutes of television
commercials for New Hampshire's Feb. 1 elections. Yet it has been
an air war _ so far _ in which hardly a punch has been thrown.
Instead the TV viewers in New Hampshire have been blitzed with
family-oriented ads featuring the contenders' personal histories,
their wives and children, and with high-toned spots focused on
candidates' favored issues. So determinedly uncontroversial have
the ad campaigns been that when the occasional harsh spot runs _
generally sponsored by third party groups and not rival campaigns _
it is news. And when Al Gore, during a December debate, sought to
win Bill Bradley's handshake on a TV ad ban, Bradley felt free to
treat the offer as a faintly ridiculous and unnecessary step.
</P>
<P>
   After all, who would even think of running a slashing negative
ad? Not Goradley. Or so they say now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, these guys are all holding back, and you have this
really unusual phenomenon of a heavy dominance of feel-good
advertising, aimed at pulling your heartstrings rather than playing
to your anger,'' said Tobe Berkovitz, professional media-buyer who
teaches a course in political advertising at Boston University.
``We haven't seen a lot of this sort of advertising for 10 years. .
. . The attacks are quite veiled.''
</P>
<P>
   While there is broad agreement that the public is hungry for
authenticity and averse to negative campaigning, there is no
consensus as to why. Some say it is a reaction against President
Clinton's smooth handling of the media and public opinion, others
that the citizenry has simply gotten disgusted with nasty contests.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy, a key strategist for the victorious campaigns of New
Jersey Governor Christine Todd Whitman and Michigan Governor John
Engler, and for the near-miss senatorial campaign of Oliver North,
might seem a fish out of water in this environment. So too Robert
Shrum and other partisans for Vice President Al Gore. They have
launched some attacks, but have not come close to using what
Berkovitz indelicately calls their ``ability and inclination to rip
the eyes out of Bill Bradley's head with television advertising.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, notwithstanding candidates' efforts to appear unscripted
and unpackaged, there is plenty of evidence of message management
about _ even an ``unscripted'' campaign, after all, must be
carefully planned.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, for example, was pushing for campaign finance reform to
reduce the role of special, monied interests in politics long
before the campaign began. But observers say he has ``tweaked'' his
message since the campaign began, improving his pitch without
altering his position.
</P>
<P>
   ``McCain had a plan and message, and he has stuck to it,'' says
Mark Mellman, a Democratic pollster. ``But when he started out, he
was talking about procedures for campaign finance reform . . . and
people's eyes glazed over. Now he has a pattern in his speeches and
his responses to questions: He talks about the problem'' he is
asked about, whether it is health care, education, or defense
spending, ``he talks about what he wants to do about it, then he
talks about why that can't be done without breaking the grip of
special interests.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain has also proved something of an artist at exploiting two
of the most valuable commodities in campaign communication: great
one-liners and repetition. Repeating the same thing over and over
in live appearances can make the candidate seem insubstantial _
witness the recent struggles of most overtly scripted major
candidate, Republican national frontrunner George W. Bush _ but
establishing a pattern as McCain has done can achieve a desired
result.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, how much repetition of paid advertising works best is
a vital calculation for campaign strategists, because television
advertising is both essential and enormously expensive. The pros
are constantly recalibrating how viewers of advertising receive and
assimilate the message.
</P>
<P>
   The era when people sat in front of the television and watched
in a concentrated way are long gone, but what it takes to drive
home a message or an image in an age of rapidly proliferating
information sources is still evolving.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, for example, there was broad agreement that a
viewer had to be exposed to an advertising message a minimum of
five times for it to sink in, and that after 10 viewings there was
a risk of overexposure. This year, saide Mark McKinnon, whose
Maverick Media company is making Texas Governor Bush's commercials,
``with the clutter of information people are seeing, 7.5 to 12.5 is
the range'' of exposures the campaign seeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Especially in a presidential election, a campaign requires a
full constellation of speeches, ads, and free press,'' McKinnon
said, but ``in a sense, everything else is wind in the sails of the
boat and advertising is the rudder. It supplies specificity and
direction.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaigns differ significantly over how to deliver the media
message, and the differences have everything to do with whether the
competing camps are using gut or scientific political methods.
</P>
<P>
   For example, McCain relies heavily on 60-second commercials,
while the rest of the candidates rely more on 30-second spots. The
campaign of Republican publisher Steve Forbes has talked with some
media outlets about 15- or even 10-second spots.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes campaign manager Bill Dal Col said he would not use
60-second spots even if he had the money to do so, because focus
groups and research show that ``in a 60, the eyes glaze over.
Really, around the 20, 25 second mark, you start to see their dials
go flat.''
</P>
<P>
   Greg Stevens, who makes McCain's ads, and Murphy, who
strategizes with him on how to use them, disdain this approach,
asserting that such calculations must be based on the quality of
material ad-makers have to work with. They think McCain's spot
holds viewers' attention because, Stevens said, ``with any product,
and candidate what you look for is the USP,'' a unique selling
point, and they believe they have found that in the Arizona
senator's war-hero-turned-political-reformer story.
</P>
<P>
   Even though McCain and Bradley both have been professional
politicians for many years, the current public hunger for
authenticity gives them a marketing edge, because each achieved
renown before entering politics, McCain as a Vietnam prisoner of
war and Bradley as an Olympic athlete and professional basketball
star, before entering politics.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and Gore, both born into political families, cannot compete
as easily on that ground, and a broad assortment of political
professionals, both inside and outside the various campaigns,
suggest the establishment candidates have had to respond by
shifting the focus.
</P>
<P>
   Up front, this has translated into the first ``strengthen our
military'' commercial of the campaign, a Bush effort to embrace a
traditionally Republican issue in simpler, more emotional terms
than McCain, and the first environmental ad, a Gore attempt to
capture similarly a traditionally Democratic issue on which Bradley
has not focused much of his campaign energies yet.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the comparatively gentlemanly start notwithstanding, it
is considered unlikely this will be an attack-ad free campaign.
Mellman said that stage ``usually . . . starts after the candidates
are better known. Nobody wants to be known as the guy who went
negative, so they wait until their images are more filled out.
Secondly, it comes out when people get a little more desperate.''
</P>
<P>
   While it is too early for desparation regarding the New
Hampshire primary, the campaign has heated up early on the small
screen. Bradley, in particular, has unleashed an enormous
television advertising blitz.
</P>
<P>
   In the four-week period beginning Nov. 23, the Bradley n
has bought 455 minutes of advertising time, worth over $1.3
million, according to figures kept by the TV stations. Gore has
spent $312,500 for 122 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being on the air now is very important for us,'' said former
Massachusetts attorney general Jim Shannon, a co-chairman of
Bradley's Massachusetts organization, because as Gore stepped up
his criticisms ``the need for a more aggressive response became
apparent.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever else might be said about advertising's significance,
there is no doubt that its expense has profoundly altered other
elements of marketing the candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no bumper stickers, no yard signs'' being given away
in most campaign offices this year, Shannon says. ``If you want
one, you go on the Internet and buy one. The campaigns license
their logos and get a royalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given a choice between bumper stickers and more television
advertising, it's not close,'' he says. ``The effect is cumulative.
Over time, through television, people get a feel.''

RICHARDSON'S SPECIALNESS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and k coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; WASHINGTON _ Everybody who still believes that in between the
noisy antagonism of election campaigns the proper political
business is to govern will mourn the passing of Elliot Richardson.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone who still believes that public service is a worthy
calling and requires the most exacting standards of integrity and
duty will mourn the passing of Elliot Richardson.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone who still believes that reason applied to the problems
of the day can accomplish more than emotion, that there is a huge
difference between succeeding and winning, will mourn the passing
of Elliot Richardson.
</P>
<P>
   But above all, everyone who still believes it can all be
exhilarating will mix a martini and enjoy a taste and a chuckle the
way Richardson did _ forever amused by life as well as relentlessly
determined to make it better.
</P>
<P>
   He was not simply a resume. He cannot be defined as simply a
Yankee. He cannot be summarized as simply the guy who refused
Richard Nixon on an October Saturday and thereby made the
president's impeachment and incontrovertible unmasking as a crook
inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson was a reformer, bound by the worthy confines of the
law he learned best from his towering judicial mentors, Learned
Hand and Felix Frankfurter. It didn't start with Watergate, it
started in Massachusetts nearly 20 years before, when he was a key
player (first as US attorney, then as the lieutenant governor and
attorney general in the John Volpe period) in a bipartisan movement
that helped bring honest government to a rather rotten state. He
used his disgust at tax cheats to nab many a scoundrel as US
attorney, including Eisenhower White House influence peddler
Bernard Goldfine, all of whom he insisted had to serve time. He was
just as tough on office-sellers at the State House.
</P>
<P>
   But Richardson was also a reformer working within the
not-always-worthy confines of party loyalty. To win his close fight
for attorney general in 1966, he stooped to gutter tactics at the
end, caspersions on Democrat Frank Bellotti via insinuation
rather than evidence. The fact that he knew he was doing wrong only
made it less acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   Down here, during the first Nixon administration, he was on
board for Phase II of the Vietnam waste, on call for countless
``leak'' investigations demanded by Nixon and in cahoots with a
White House-ordered policy of doing only as judicially ordered on
school desegregation. But it was also true that he was making
policy for a generally successful administration that was
conserving and even enlarging upon the major achievements of the
1960s. For a hothead, it was a formative experience in the
realization that there are some people you look up to, respect, and
deal with even as you disagree strongly on policy issues; they are
called leaders.
</P>
<P>
   But Vietnam and the abuses of human and constitutional rights
were blind spots. It was difficult sometimes, beyond Richardson's
obvious dedication to scrupulous public service, to know where his
rudder was in those years. As his resume lengthened (from two Ike
appointments to state jobs and three Nixon posts by the beginning
of the second term), I started calling him ``Suitcase'' after the
1950s outfielder Harry Simpson, who had played for six teams in
eight years. Richardson, who was more Harvard Lampoon than merely
Harvard, thought it was funny.
</P>
<P>
   But then Watergate happened. Hindsight blurs the drama and the
immense stakes of those days. It was a stage to which Richardson
brought his sense of duty, honor, dedication to the law, concern
for constitutional stability, and rectitude. And he electrnd
transfixed a country desperate for mature, principled leadership.
His role was actually twofold: getting Vice President Spiro Agnew
out of office and refusing to fire the special prosecutor he had
the great wisdom to name (Archibald Cox). With Agnew, a two-bit
grafter who was still taking payoffs in his office, Richardson saw
the greater imperative in getting him out of office that justified
taking a nolo plea on a tax charge rather than in going through a
long trial of a man next in line to a president who was himself on
the ropes.
</P>
<P>
   With Nixon, Attorney General Richardson bent over backwards (as
did Cox) to compromise on the issue of subpoened White House tapes.
But in his moment of truth, his word to the Senate not to block the
Cox inquiry from evidence and not to fire Cox for any but the most
serious improprieties and his devotion to the law trumped his
loyalty to a president.
</P>
<P>
   I will never forget the scene at the Justice Department the
Monday following the ``Massacre.'' Nixon had yet to cave on the
tapes or on a new presecutor; his actions had reached the border of
literal crime. The main hall in the place was packed with the
employees; their ovation when Richardson entered was thunderous,
thrilling. Wisely, however, he chose to stress duty rather than
defiance, restraint over revulsion.
</P>
<P>
   The passage of time should not dull the country's appreciation
of this special man. If anything, time only adds to the luster of
this Yankee who stood as tall in the Oval Office as he did on Utah
Beach.

DOUBTS ON JETS' CHOICE AREN'T MERELY NITPICKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ There were several cameras staked outside of
Foxboro Stadium Monday. I still can't believe one of them was not
from ``E!'' television. Really, it wasn't clear what exactly was
happening here. Was this Pete Carroll's dismissal or was it his
former players' re-creation of the arrival scene at the Academy
Awards?
</P>
<P>
   You saw players arrive in Benzes and SUVs. You saw them wave at
the cameras (Lawyer Milloy stuck out his tongue and eventually took
a picture of the media). You sensed no pall. You imagined Joan and
Melissa Rivers holding microphones and saying, ``There's Ty Law
wearing his stylish shirt, designed by Maurice Malone . . . And,
over there in the red hat, Lawyer. A red hat? Don't go there, baby
. . .''
</P>
<P>
   This was a party, a soiree to celebrate the end of the season
and the end of the old boss. It's funny: The only man who should
have been throwing a party was the one who was fired. Everyone else
should have been near a church, temple, mosque, or mountaintop, in
prayer or meditation.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because the Patriots are in trouble. It's one thing to have
problems and know you have them. It's quite different to be
descending toward the belly of a canyon without realizing it.
That's where Robert Kraft and his team are this morning. In the
past 48 hours, they have actually flirted with becoming worse
without Carroll. I say flirted because Kraft might have completed
the disaster if Bill Parcells hadn't done him a huge favor by
resigning as head coach of the Jets Monday.
</P>
<P>
   If Parcells hadn't resigned, Kraft would have tried to hire his
top assistant, Bill Belichick. Instead, Belichick is the No. 1
football man for the New York Jets, an organization he will destroy
if Parcells doesn't hold his handcially when it's time to
draft players.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft faxed a letter to Jets president Steve Gutman Monday
morning requesting permission to speak with Belichick. He had
intentions of giving Belichick coaching and personnel power; it
would have left his organization looking like the ruins of Rome.
</P>
<P>
   You may have heard stories about Belichick and his dour
personality. You may have heard that he is one of three people in
America who still listens to Bon Jovi. All of that is irrelevant.
What you have not heard about is Belichick's drafts during his five
seasons with the old Cleveland Browns.
</P>
<P>
   They were awful.
</P>
<P>
   Why was Kraft going to hire this man to be the caretaker of his
organization? The fact that he was even thinking about it shows
that he has already gotten off to a bad start with his job search
for a new coach/general manager. The first thing Kraft should do
this morning is find the list with Belichick's name atop it and
torch it. I'd hate to see the second name on the list.
</P>
<P>
   Before anyone asks, I have no Belichick agenda. I worked in Ohio
for 2 1/2 of his five seasons with the Browns. I think he responded
sarcastically to a few questions I asked, but I have heard much
worse from some of my ex-girlfriends.
</P>
<P>
   To this day, the only man in Cleveland who has had more
personnel power than Belichick is the late (and legendary) Paul
Brown. Looking at the facts _ and ignoring Belichick's personality
_ his drafts rank among the NFL's worst in the 1990s. Compared with
Belichick, Bobby Grier is a gridiron Red Auerbach.
</P>
<P>
   I don't want to depress you, so here's a brief Belichick
sampler.
</P>
<P>
   From 1991-93, the Browns had the second, ninth, and 14th picks
in the first round. Picking that high, you should come away with
two great players. They came away with safety Eric Turner (who was
rated 43d and 66th by two NFL scouting services), fullback Tommy
Vardell, and center Steve Everitt. They passed on the likes of
Herman Moore, Todd Lyght, Eric Swann, Kevin Smith, Dale Carter,
Robert Porcher, Robert Smith, Wayne Simmons, John Fina, and Dana
Stubblefield.
</P>
<P>
   And that's just the first round.
</P>
<P>
   It actually gets worse, but I'll wait a couple paragraphs before
I get to the rest. For now, I'll say that Carroll is Bill
Belichick, minus the association to Parcells. Both men are
brilliant defensive coordinators. Both men probably should not be
NFL head coaches, and that's not necessarily a demeaning thing.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll has a better career regular-season record than
Belichick. He also has a better sense of perspective. It is
Belichick's choice not to talk with the media, although it is one
of the easiest gigs you could have. It's not like reporters are
going to ask you to assess the fledgling Vladimir Putin era in
Moscow. Belichick may understand that now, but there is no
indication that he knows how to pick players. How does a defensive
(itals)genius(unitals) pass up so many talented defensive players
in the draft?
</P>
<P>
   Once again, Kraft was going to give the keys to him rather than
stick with Grier/Carroll? That's like telling your 16-year-old
daughter that she is not responsible enough to drive the family
car, but that your 12-year-old son is.
</P>
<P>
   OK, about those drafts. During that '91-93 period, the Browns
also took Ed King, Patrick Rowe, and Dan Footman in the second All were busts. Belichick passed on the following
second-rounders: Ricky Watters, Brett Favre, Phil Hansen, Roman
Phifer, Darryl Lewis, Dixon Edwards, Chuck Smith, Phillipi Sparks,
Steve Israel, Carl Pickens, Levon Kirkland, Will Shields, Chad
Brown, Michael Strahan, and Natrone Means.
</P>
<P>
   It gets even worse, but I'm not going to touch the rest of it.
</P>
<P>
   Let's just say that Kraft obviously needs to take his time on
making any decisions and ignore the person who recommended
Belichick to him. He needs to quiz as many NFL types as possible
and find out who can really help his team.
</P>
<P>
   And, yes, these players needs help. The more I hear them say how
much talent they have ``on paper,'' the more irritated I become.
They are talented; so what? Their problem is that, collectively,
they are unprofessional.
</P>
<P>
   Strangely, the only man whose actions matched reality Monday was
Carroll. He gave his press conference from the parking lot. He
shook hands with many of the men and women who who called for him
to be fired. He jumped into his Jaguar (cynics said the Patriots
were going to put the Denver boot on it) and rode off onto Route 1
smiling. He is well-paid, another job awaits, and he is free from
this maddening team.
</P>
<P>
   As he broke away, some of his former players toasted his
departure. They know not what they do. They should pray because
their new leader was almost worse than their old one. Kraft? He has
an alternative if he doesn't want to pray: All he has to do is do
his homework and take his time.

   On July 1, the longest combined rail/road/tunnel project in the
world will open to traffic. The Oresund Bridge, linking Denmark and
Sweden, will also create the Oresund Region, the largest domestic

   The first World Exposition in the new millennium opens June 1 in
Hanover, Germany. EXPO 2000 is expected to draw some 40 million
visitors and will feature innovative projects from around the
world. In the past, world expositions emphasized industrial
progress; the Hanover fair, however, will show how technical
progress can serve new goals. ``This new type of world exposition
will not be a presentation of superlative technical achievements.
Instead it will show how humankind can discover a new natural
balance through technology designed to serve the human race,'' said
Birgit Breuel, commissioner general of the World EXPO 2000. The
fair will run through Oct. 31.
</P>
<P>
   EXPO 2000 will cover 395 acres, with exhibits from more than 190
nations. The United States will offer an interactive Brain Ride,
with visitors functioning as neurons speeding through a visual and
sonic journey. The United Arab Emirates pavilion will be of
recycled materials and feature a 360-degree cinema with a
presentation on the country's conservation efforts and plans to
free itself from economic dependence on oil. The Japanese pavilion
will be made of paper and will be biodegradable.

   ``Walt Disney once referred to Epcot as a `living blueprint of
the future,' '' said Al Weiss, president of Walt Disney World
Resort. ``And it is in that spirit that we welcome the world to
celebrate the millennium at this, our discovery park.'' In true
Disney fashion, this millennium celebration will dazzle the eyes
right through Jan. 1, 2001. If you haven't been to Disney World in
a while, this is the year to do so. The parks are filled with new
attractions and shows. Epcot will feature ``IllumiNations 2000:
Reflections of Earth,'' a spectacular nighttime show with
sky-piercing lasers and more fireworks than any show before.

   In November, Royal Caribbean began sailing the world's largest
cruise ship, the Voyager of the Seas at 142,000 tons. This fall, a
sister ship, the Explorer of the Seas, will begin its maiden
voyage. These ships offer no excuses for not trying a cruise; they
are true resorts at sea with features such as an ice skating rink,
a rock-climbing tower, and in-line skating aboard. Cruise
popularity continues to grow with the introduction of ships such as
these.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the world's largest are two smaller ships
offering a different experience at sea. In June, Royal Olympic will
introduce the world's fastest cruise ship, the Olympic Explorer,
capable of visiting three continents in one week. The Olympic
Explorer will sail from Greece to Turkey, with visits to both Egypt
and Israel _ a remarkable journey.
</P>
<P>
   The age of sail is still very much alive. This year Star
Clippers will introduce the Royal Clipper, the largest sailing
vessel to hit the seas.
</P>
<P>
   While all these events and trips are tempting, the threat of war
or terrorism could change everything. War and terrorism are still
major factors in influencing where we go. Last year the conflict in
Kosovo caused tourism to drop in parts of Europe and almost stopped
the European cruise season. Even though the conflict was far from
most European tourist sites, the perception for many was that the
areas were not safe. Hopefully this year will be different.
</P>
<P>
   And for those who stayed home for New Year's Eve, midnight next
Dec. 31 is the true start of the new millennium, so get ready to
really party that night.

UNCERTAINTY FOLLOWS 1999'S BROKEN RULES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Stock prices and interest rates are supposed to work like kids
on opposite sides of a see-saw: When rates go up, stock prices are
supposed to come down.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, the relationship broke down. Interest rates rose
steadily all year but stocks shrugged off the news and turned in
another spectacular performance. Could the same thing happen again
in 2000 or is this the year reality, and interest rates, start to
bite?
</P>
<P>
   ``That is going to be the dominant question for the market in
the first few months of the year,'' said Jim Weiss, chief
investment officer for equities at State Street Research.
</P>
<P>
   Long-term interest rates Monday reached their highest level
since September 1997. The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond
climbed to 6.61 percent, up from 6.48 percent Friday. At the
beginning of 1999, that same bond yielded just over 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The rise in rates is not hard to understand. It is a logical
response to a strong economy that shows no sign of slowing down.
The US economy expanded at roughly a 4 percent pace in 1999, the
fourth straight year of supercharged growth. Consumer confidence is
at a 31-year high. At 4.1 percent, the jobless rate is the lowest
it has been in a generation. Inflation remains modest, but no one
is sure how long that can last.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economy is growing too strongly for its own good and the
Fed is going to move,'' said Wayne Ayers, chief economist at
FleetBoston Financial Group. Like most of his fellow forecasters,
Ayers expects the Fed to hike short-term interest rates at its
February meeting. Most economists look for at least one more rate
hike after that. Nearly all think the yield on the 30-year bond
will reach 6.75; a few think 7 percent is a distinct possibility.
</P>
<P>
   At the risk of repeating ourselves, higher interest rates are
supposed to be a negative for stocks. Higher rates make bonds more
attractive, increase borrowing costs, and reduce the value of
future earnings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Normally, based on the rise in rates we got last year, you
would have expected the stock market to fall 20 percent,'' said
David Wyss, chief economist at DRI Standard &AMP; Poor's. Instead the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index rose 20 percent; the Nasdaq Composite
index climbed nearly 85 percent.
</P>
<P>
   No one is quite sure why 1999 broke all the rules. Wyss suggests
investors have changed their views about the risks associated with
stocks and bonds and are willing now to accept a smaller ``risk
premium'' for holding stocks than they did in the past. Others say
the terrific earnings generated by US companies were more important
to the market last year than rates.
</P>
<P>
   Still others point to the new economy, which according to its
boosters, is changing the rules of the game. In the new economy, so
the thinking goes, technology makes business more productive, which
in turn minimizes inflationary pressure. If there isn't going to be
much inflation, then any climb in interest rates may prove to be
temporary.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Zandi thinks new economy fans may be suffering from
irrational exuberance. ``When people get as optimistic as they are
now, nothing matters,'' said Zandi, chief economist at RFA Dismal
Science. ``Bad news is no news and good news is great news. The
people buying technology stocks today are convinced that their
payoff is so far in the future that things like interest rates
don't count.''
</P>
<P>
   Zandi thinks interest rates do count and that rates will rise
until the economy slows down. That slowdown, he says, is likely to
trigger a fall in stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   Allen Sinai thinks a stock market correction of 10 percent to 20
percent is likely as investors ``wake up and look ahead to the
coming Fed tightenings.'' Sinai, chief economist at Primark
Decision Economics, thinks the correction could come sooner, rather
than later.
</P>
<P>
   Monday might be considered a precursor of things to come.
Interest rates climbed and stocks tumbled. The Dow Jones industrial
average fell sharply. Interest-sensitive stocks such as banks were
especially hard hit.
</P>
<P>
   Yet once again, the technology-heavy Nasdaq managed to post a
gain for the day. Many leading Internet stocks rose when Merrill
Lynch analyst Henry Blodget said he remained ``optimistic'' about
the stocks' prospects in 2000. Andover-based CMGI, one of last
year's hottest stocks, went up another 15 percent Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently reality isn't biting everyone just yet.
</P>
<P>
   The red herring
</P>
<P>
   It's a thorny crown, but somebody has to wear it.
</P>
<P>
   Mutual fund manager Brian Stack of MFS Investment Management was
an easy winner in Boston Capital's 1999 stockpicking contest,
defeating three other contestants who each lost money by selecting
one stock to hold for the entire calendar year.
</P>
<P>
   Stack's selection of SportsLine.com Inc., an Internet sports
information company, earned 222.1 percent for the year. He was the
second Boston Capital winner from the MFS money manager stable,
following former colleague John Brennan.
</P>
<P>
   Among the other 1999 contestants, Warren Isabelle lost 7.6
percent on his selection of M.A. Hanna Co.; Richard Dalhberg of the
Pioneer Group lost 35.4 percent on Compaq Computer Corp.; Lee
Allen, a registered investment adviser, saw his Waste Management
Inc. pick slump 63.1 percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ OK, they've made it. Now what?
</P>
<P>
   The true believers at Fast Company magazine have had a boffo
year: a National Magazine Award for General Excellence, a
circulation rate base of 500,000 for the new year, and a healthy
profit after a mere four years in print. More important, they have
created a brand name to die for and, hype aside, altered the vector
of business journalism.
</P>
<P>
   Quite simply, they are riding the hottest American business
publication of the late '90s. And they know it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our moment,'' said cofounder William Taylor, 40, who
worships at the altar of Bruce Springsteen when he is not editing
copy in Fast Company's offices near the North End. ``We have
arrived. The planets have aligned themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   So what do they do for an encore?
</P>
<P>
   The magazine that preaches reinvention is going to have to
reinvent itself. Its content, tone, and size need attention, which
will involve the nail-biting introspection the magazine demands of
other businesses in its self-proclaimed role as ``the handbook of
the New Economy.'' In short, Fast Company must manage its success.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the self-absorption that permeates the staff is the
understanding that they could blow it if they do not act wisely
now. Printed beneath the logo on the cover every month are the
words, ``What are you working on?'' This is what they're working
on.
</P>
<P>
   Fast Company burst onto the scene in November 1995 as a business
magazine that covered the culture of work instead of the corporate
icons who dominate it. Patrick Mitchell, art director for the
magazine, calls this approach ``the end of fabulousness.''
</P>
<P>
   It went where starched outfits such as Fortune and Forbes had
never dreamed of going and championed the idea that work is
personal. ``People are bringing more of themselves to work than
ever before,'' said Taylor. ``To some degree, `the company' is a
complete fiction. It stands for a set of values. That's all.''
</P>
<P>
   The book, as magazines are called in the trade, was an immediate
hit. It ran landmark covers such as``Free Agent Nation,'' ``The
Brand Called You,'' and ``Quit Your Job.'' The messianic message
was and is: You are the CEO of your own career. ``Fast Company is
the voice of that dream,'' said Jeff Taylor, founder of Monster.com
of Maynard, Mass., the world's largest career Web site. It won
fistfuls of awards, a huge community of die-hard fans, and herds of
blue-chip advertisers. By the fall, it had swollen to resemble a
hip version of the Manhattan phone book.
</P>
<P>
   Visions of sugarplums dance in the head of owner Mortimer
Zuckerman as he considers its prospects. Plans are under way to
exploit the Fast Company brand in a variety of ways. And, while he
rebutted rumors that the publication is for sale for $200 million _
and, he said, he gets offers every month _ efforts to market its
name will only boost its selling price if and when a deal occurs.
</P>
<P>
   Zuckerman said he is worried most about burnout among his
editors _ and for good reason. The masthead is small for the size
book it produces and the ancillary projects under construction.
With the growth, William Taylor and cofounder Alan Webber, 51, must
cede some of their duties to others. This will be hard for the pair
of talented control freaks who are the soul of the magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are at an inflection pointlor said. ``Success is
every bit as much a test of character as adversity. What is our
definition of success? What business do we think we're in? What
values do we stand for? We are in the middle of asking ourselves
those very basic questions.''
</P>
<P>
   They have no choice. The master plan to market the Fast Company
brand fundamentally realigns the corporate constellation, and it is
unclear whether the magazine will be dwarfed by the other arms of
the enterprise. Or if that even matters.
</P>
<P>
   There will be a dizzying increase this year in the roster of
live events scheduled around the country under the arm called
RealTime. Fast Company columnist John Ellis calls RealTime ``Viagra
for the business side,'' and it is easy to see why. The events will
bring together reader with reader, companies with advertisers,
management with employees. The potential is huge.
</P>
<P>
   RealTime plans a career day called Work In Progress, a Day of
Social Responsibility, and perhaps a Work-Life Summit, according to
26-year-old Dawn Wells, an alumna of Michael Milken's operations,
who runs RealTime.
</P>
<P>
   Then, too, there is the Company of Friends, dreamed up and run
by another 26-year-old, Heath Row. The ``company'' refers to some
25,000 Fast Company fans in 100 cities around the world who meet
regularly to discuss issues raised in the magazine. Each node is
called a ``cell'' to play off Fast Company's grandiose assertion
that it is a movement, not a magazine. Row is planning a Company of
Friends Summit next year to bring cell leaders together. The man
thinks big.
</P>
<P>
   At the center of all this will be Fast Company's award-winning
Web site, due for a huge expansion to coordinate the efforts of
RealTime and Company of Friends. Publisher Julian Lowin salivates
as he calls the Web-related package ``the most exciting part of the
movement.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Web is a major priority and a huge opportunity for us,''
added Webber, who edited the Harvard Business Review in a previous
incarnation. ``We don't see the different parts as separate
entities. They are all driven by the same culture and values. The
magazine is part of a larger picture. From the beginning, we have
thought in terms of a giant satellite dish to pull in informatiothen find multiple channels to distribute it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, everyone agrees the workload must change. The
cognitive dissonance between the Fast Company message of balancing
work and personal life against the pervasive ``24/7'' mentality
that rules in-house is striking. ``There are a lot of exhausted
people walking around here,'' Mitchell said. A hiring campaign is
under way to address the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Externally, Fast Company faces relentless competition for
dominance in its New Economy domain. Books such as Red Herring,
Business 2.0, and Industry Standard are flourishing, while hipper
versions of established brands such as Fortune, Business Week, and
Forbes have aped the Fast Company look and themes.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they started, they had the whole thing to themselves,''
Ellis noted. ``You have to remember how awful Fortune was in those
days. There was a great opportunity and they took it. Now that
world is getting crowded. They're being attacked from all sides.''
</P>
<P>
   Internally, the most obvious issue to be addressed at Fast
Company is size. Many readers find that it has become too much of a
good thing. The December issue _ a 458-page behemoth _ could anchor
a screen door on a windy day. Edward Ossie, a charter subscriber
and CEO of MTW, a software consulting company based in Kansas City,
Mo., doubts he has ever finished an issue. And he is a big fan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all feel we're creating too much magazine,'' Mitchell
conceded.
</P>
<P>
   But the whopping 1,748 pages of ads last year speak to the
financial vitality of the publication. ``After 25 years of
groveling for ads, this thing is still going through the roof,''
said Zuckerman, referring to his other media acquisitions. ``What's
not to like?''
</P>
<P>
   What's not to like is the effect on editorial content. The ads
effectively drive the text now: For every advertising page, there
must be a page of text. ``We've stopped cutting,'' Mitchell said.
``We let articles go long to fill space. There is no easy way out.
In the past, we took stories from future issues. Then we faced
400-page magazines with nothing in the cupboard. It took feedback
from advertisers who said, `I can't find my ad in that magazine.'
''
</P>
<P>
   ``You're no longer opposite the table of contents as you were at
the beginning,'' added Kevin McCarthy, associate media director for
BBDO Worldwide, the New York advertising giant. ``Now you're on
page 287 out of 360.''
</P>
<P>
   Tone is another challenge. From its inception, Fast Company was
the booster of the New Economy, and it lionized those individuals,
in a large company or self-employed, who sought to fuse their
personal and professional personas.
</P>
<P>
   Absent in its coverage, though, has been much skepticism about
life in the New Economy. Plenty of people in the Free Agent Nation
fail miserably, but you wouldn't know that reading Fast Company.
The pieces overwhelmingly are bright and shiny. Webber conceded the
point. ``We're going to tinker with the emotional palette,'' he
said. ``We will paint with more colors.''
</P>
<P>
   And then there is the content. One specter to be confronted is
repetition. At some point, more stories about new paradigms of
managing will feel old. Webber and Taylor counter that superior
writers, editors, and designers will continue to confect
interesting reads. Perhaps.
</P>
<P>
   One thing is clear: The content mix will change significantly to
include increased coverage of the ``dot.coms'' _ the
Internet-related start-ups that populate the landscape of the New
Economy. Fast Company experimented with two ``NET Company'' inserts
distributed with the magazine that focused exclusively on the
topic. But Webber and Taylor have decided to incorporate the
coverage into their own brand.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many dot.com cowboys opt for publications that focus more
on new technology and the competitors that could devour them.
Entrepreneurs like Throop Wilder,ld American Internet to
Cisco Systems last year for $60 million, reads industry journals
such as PC Week and Industry Standard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need to know what new companies there are in my area and
what new technologies are there in the supply chain above me,''
Wilder said. ``I've never really gotten a good idea for management
for a business from the magazines. It's like `reduce your abs' in
every issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Fast Company is unfazed by such talk and continues to move at
warp speed. It has to. The New Economy demands it. That's the
problem with the New Economy. It is unmodulated.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must go from a hot brand to a power brand,'' said publisher
Lowin, ``because hot brands can get cold.''

PLEASE _ THEY'D RATHER SLEEP!

<TEXT>
<P>
   Great sleep beats great sex, say business travelers in a new
survey.
</P>
<P>
   According to ``Sleeping on the Road: A Sleep Study by Westin
Hotels and Resorts,'' twice as many respondents said they'd opt for
the superb snoozing over the lovemaking. In fact, 63 percent rated
a good night's sleep as the most important service a hotel can
provide. Other findings:
</P>
<P>
   --By a margin of more than 4 to 1, most said they would rather
sleep in a hotel than at their mother-in-law's.
</P>
<P>
   --One in 3 said they have an alcoholic beverage to help them
fall asleep on the road.
</P>
<P>
   --Only 11 percent admitted to watching adult movies in their
rooms.
</P>
<P>
   --On average, the people surveyed took 24 minutes to fall asleep
in a hotel room, compared with 15 minutes at home.
</P>
<P>
   --And to that old question, ``Do you sleep in the nude?'' 11
percent of men answered yes, while only 2 percent of women did.
</P>
<P>
   (Westin released the survey in conjunction with an announcement
that it is putting 52,000 new beds in its 39,500 guest rooms in 83
hotels in North America.) &QL;

Travel Trivia: You've probably heard of Timbuktu almost all your

In a name: Because they draw crowds, the sea lions who gather near
San Francisco's popular Pier 39 entertainment-dining complex have
been nicknamed ``sea lebrities.'' (The sea lions made their first
appearance 10 years ago this month, and Pier 39 plans an
activity-filled celebration Jan. 22-23.) &QL;

Museum of the month: Frank Sinatra is being saluted in the town he
grew up in: Hoboken, N.J. The Frank Sinatra Museum, dedicated to
the man some say was the century's greatest entertainer, is filled
with letters, memorabilia, and the singer's personal possessions.
The museum, a former knicknack shop, is next door to what was
Sinatra's boyhood home at 415 Monroe St. and is now a vacant lot. &QL; 
 &QL; 
And speaking of Sinatra: The Rat Pack Cafe near Shoppers World on
Route 9, Framingham, Mass., is festooned with photos and mementos
of Old Blue Eyes and his pallies, and serves the kind of food and
drink that we suspect Frank, Dino, and Sammy would have relished.

<P>
   We recently mentioned that the word ``toast'' was popularized in
the 17th century when a piece of roasted bread was floated on the
drink for reasons that are no longer remembered. But Milton Paisner
of North Andover, Mass. forwards this amusing explanation:
</P>
<P>
   ``Long ago the art of refining whiskey was not perfect and when
the liquid was poured into a glass dregs appeared on the top. A
piece of toast was put in the glass, it absorbed the dregs; when it
was removed the liquid was clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go now to the Restoration of King Charles II in 1660. The
Cromwell era, a time of repression of theaters, humor in any form,
was ended. The people were greatly relieved and `all hell broke
loose.' A vat of wine was set up in a public square, a `lady of the
evening' appeared, saw the wine, took off all her clothes and
climbed into the vat. There she is in the middle of the vat, like
the toast in the middle of a glass of whiskey. A man somewhat the
worse for wear, `three sheets to the wind,' appeared, saw the vat
of wine and wanted some to drink. They told him he had had enough,
whereupon he said, `If I can't have the wine I'll take the toast'
(the lady in the middle of the vat).
</P>
<P>
   ``The `toast,' therefore, is the person to whom words are
addressed at a party. . . . There may be other explanations but
this is the one I have been using as a study group leader at the
Harvard Institute for Learning in Retirement and as a lecturer at
many independent living and assisted living communities around the
area.''

BLOOP! GOES WAIOTAPU'S MUD GEYSER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS

<P>
   WAIOTAPU, New Zealand _ Bloop!
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's mud in your eye!'' seems to be the New Year's toast
from some underworld god lurking beneath the thick and grimy
surface of the steaming pond.
</P>
<P>
   Bloop! Bloop! Plop! Plop! Two sudden spurts of wet dirt,
splattering against my cheeks and chest, baptize me as I stand on a
wooden platform at pond's edge. ``Too close for comfort,'' says my
friend, Aurelio, laughing. ``But at least it's sacred water. That's
what Waiotapu means in the Maori language. Consider it a millennial
badge of honor, bestowed on you in, shall we say, a supernatural
rite. Anyway, it'll wash off your T-shirt.''
</P>
<P>
   Is a remote sylvan pond supposed to spit at its visitors?
Absolutely, if impolitely, at Waiotapu Thermal Park. Here mud is
upchucked fast, furiously, and fascinatingly with blooping sound
effects all over the place.
</P>
<P>
   ``It never stops,'' says Richard Fulton, a park ranger. Here a
bloop, there a bloop. Everywhere a boiling-and-bubbling bloop-bloop
as gray eruptions, one after another, echo across the hot waters,
sounding like a laundromat. Or maybe like your stomach yesterday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   Fulton suggests we follow him to see ``our best eruption, Lady
Knox. She'll let loose in about five minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Can this be ladylike behavior?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's geyserlike,'' Fulton says. The geyser, a daily pop-off,
was named in 1903 for Lady Constance Knox, daughter of New
Zealand's governor general, and springs from a short shape, a rocky
cone with the tallowy look of a used candle. ``Sometimes she boils
up on her own. Most times, like today, she'll need help.''
</P>
<P>
   He is Lady Knox's helper. ``To make sure she keeps her morning
appointment at 10:15, I'll pour a kilo and a half of soap flakes in
the opening. That primes her, releases surface tension.''
</P>
<P>
   By this time a gathering of spectators fills a small grandstand,
and Fulton dumps in the soap. Shortly, Lady Knox, ever reliable,
rumbles and then gushes on schedule. It's a grandstanding
performance as guaranteed, torrid water shooting to a height of 40
feet, and continuing for about 30 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, folks, that's it for today,'' Fulton says.
</P>
<P>
   But there is much more to mysterious Waiotapu, a rustic preserve
lying in the North Island's thermal belt, south of the
well-gardened-and-groomed city of Rotorua. A walking path among
rock formations leads to festering craters and caverns, simmering
pools, large and small, each appropriately named. Their mystical
beauty is punctuated in startling, mineralized colors.
</P>
<P>
   Devil's Bath hisses in apple green (Eve's apple?) from the
arsenic content. Champagne Pool, edged in bright orange from
antimony, is namesake bubbly. Opal pool, crossed by a bridge, and
tinted by sulfur, manganese, iron oxide, silica, and carbon shows
off as an artist's palette in yellow, purple, red, white, and
black. Threateningly dark, Inferno Crater growls and gnashes
ominously, known to occasionally gurgitate toweringly to 60 feet.
I'm not turning my back on it.
</P>
<P>
   Devil's Ink Pots, a series of gurgling, spewing mudders, is one
more potential splatosphere, percolating happily to insist there is
joy in mudville. Seems like this is where we came in.
</P>
<P>
   Back to Rotorua for lunch. Whereupon the day's demonic theme
continues at the destination of a drive northeast to desolate
Hell's Gate, another hot spot layout of grim, smoking, sulfuric
pits and roiling bodies of water amid jagged rocky landscape. You
expect Mephistopheles himself to appear as a cordial guide,
offering a holiday special on fire and brimstone.
</P>
<P>
   Author George Bernard Shaw dropped by in 1934, only to say, ``I
wish I'd never seen the place. It reminds me too vividly of the
fate theologians have promised me.'' He named a pair of blistering,
burping mudholes Sodom and Gomorrah _ ``places of no return.''
</P>
<P>
   Such is Hurutini's Pool, said to be the resting place of a
suicidal Maori princess of that name, a victim of unrequited love.
Maoris of old used some of the scalding pools as stoves, immersing
meat and potatoes to cook in woven baskets. Maybe Hurutini was
lovelorn, but isn't it more reasonable to surmise that she burned
dinner irretrievably one evening, depressing her sufficiently to
leap in?
</P>
<P>
   We'll never know. At Princes Gate Hotel in Rotorua, a charming
century-old wooden inn with whitewashed, gingerbread balconies, the
concierge suggests steam-heating ourselves in the thermal baths of
the nearby Polynesian Spa. In a Japanese rock garden setting, the
outdoor pools of varying temperatures, up to 114 degrees, soothe
weary travelers' bodies without baking them into mud pies.

WHERE ARE THE NITS   OF YESTERYEAR? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAN FREEMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's here at last (or not, depending on how you count) _ but no
matter when you date the turn of the millennium, it's a good bet
that you're sick of hearing the word. Linguist Geoff Nunberg put it
on his list of forgettables in a recent verse commentary for NPR's
``Fresh Air'': ``I'm glad to bid that one adieu _ / The fact is
that I never knew / If it should have one n or two.'' And
millennium topped the least-liked list at Lake Superior State
University, which has greeted the past 25 New Years with a roster
of ``Words Banished from the Queen's English for Mis-Use, Over-Use
and General Uselessness.'' (Why the Queen's English? Perhaps
because LSSU, in Sault Ste. Marie, Mich., is practically in
Ontario; its PR folks came up with the language poll as a gimmick
to put the small state university on our mental map.)
</P>
<P>
   Now, both Nunberg and the LSSU listmakers know that trying to
dam the currents of language is a futile exercise; the words they
deplore will either die of neglect or be welcomed, if not always
warmly, into the lexicon. Still, we've all seen words we would
happily wish away, and LSSU's project gives netizens (a word on
Nunberg's hit list), though not the computer-challenged (banished
at LSSU in 1995), a place to vent their spleen and record their
crotchets. To vote, go to lssu.edu/banished. And while you're
there, see what you think of the year's other losers _ 24/7,
outside the box, e-anything.
</P>
<P>
   Because creativity counts at LSSU _ ``Witty, humorous
explanations are always moved to the top of the pile,'' according
to the committee's press release _ there are some oddities here.
Librarians with computers are calling themselves cybarians? Who
knew? The voters want to get rid of issues _ those vague ones
everyone seems to have ``around'' something _ but that usage seems
to be fading on its own, or being used ironically, which is the
next best thing. They're right to note that at risk is thriving,
but somehow they missed the ubiquitous give (something) back. When
did we all stop reaching out and start giving back? Or are the true
role models those wonderful people who can do both at once?
</P>
<P>
   The e- prefix is being watched everywhere, and even opponents
must concede that e-mail is here to stay. But the dictionary
wizards at Oxford University Press say they're keeping an eye on
e-, waiting to see which coinages _ e-commerce (probably), e-lancer
(hope not), e-junkmail (already spammed into oblivion?) _ will win
spots in their ``ultimate e-book,'' the forthcoming OED on line.
</P>
<P>
   One problem with LSSU's list (and they should get over it) is
its presumption that ``verbing'' of nouns is wrong in principle.
English has long verbed its nouns _ hand me the dictionary and I'll
prove it _ so these have to be considered case by case, not
condemned as violations of some eternal language law. Aesthetic
objections are in order, however, and we may all join in shouting
down solution as a verb replacing solve. On the other hand, if the
people who climb mountains want to summit them instead of reaching
the summit, it's their call; at those altitudes, they need to save
their breath. Orchestrate has been a verb since the 1880s. And as
for mentor, added to the list last year, it's a verb in my
dictionary _ and why not?
</P>
<P>
   In fact, word worriers should be reassured by a look at LSSU's
all-time banished list, a record of angst and protest over 25
years. These words aren't annotated on the Web site, so we can only
wonder why fruitworthy and funeralized once looked threatening, and
whether nullities and voidities required defensive action. Why ban
overcrowded? Did somebody think it meant the same as crowded _
someone who'd never taken public transportation, presumably?
</P>
<P>
   Articulate (noun? verb?) must have been misbehaving in 1983,
when it was listed, but who remembers how? As for bare naked, it
may be redundant, but it's also idiomatic and jocular;
multitasking, too, is almost never used unself-consciously, so it's
in that irony-protected area of language-land, along with I feel
your pain. But whatever your shibboleths, you're sure to find peace
and perspective in this quarter-century's worth of nitpicking.
</P>
<P>
   Even more fun, though, is the Nunberg solution: Wrap up your pet
peeves in a few lines of poetry, and consign them to a scrapbook.
Here's my little farewell to some of the worst _ and you've got a
whole year to compose your own New Year's sendoff before the real
m__ comes around.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(poetry style) &QL;

</P>
<P>
   May the bottom line keep bulging
</P>
<P>
   as we roll through Y2K,
</P>
<P>
   So we'll have something to give back
</P>
<P>
   at the end of the day.
</P>

MUSICAL ACTIVISM WAS MAYFIELD'S SOUL PURPOSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RENEE GRAHAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When he died last week, Curtis Mayfield didn't generate the
headlines and sound bites afforded our various premillennial
tensions, Jerry Seinfeld's wedding, or the latest stupid gangsta
tricks of Puff Daddy, arrested on gun charges with his moll,
Jennifer Lopez.
</P>
<P>
   After all, Mayfield, 57, had been in fragile health since he was
paralyzed in a freak accident when a lighting scaffold collapsed on
him during a 1990 performance in Brooklyn, N.Y. So it may have been
easy for some to dismiss news of his death as just the passing of
another faded star who did something worthwhile a long time ago.
</P>
<P>
   But so much more was lost Dec. 26. For if Aretha Franklin is the
Queen of Soul, Ray Charles the Genius of Soul, and James Brown the
Godfather of Soul, then Curtis Mayfield was the music's poet
laureate.
</P>
<P>
   Before Brown encouraged a people to ``Say It Loud (I'm Black and
I'm Proud),'' before Marvin Gaye got those ``Inner City Blues,''
before Bob Marley told us to ``Get Up, Stand Up,'' and Chuck D told
us to ``Fight the Power,'' Mayfield instilled in black music a
moral compass, a sense of right and wrong. He was to soul what Bob
Dylan was to folk-rock, offering sermons in song that could educate
as well as entertain.
</P>
<P>
   During a career that began in the late 1950s with the
Impressions and concluded with his acclaimed last album, ``New Word
Order,'' in 1996, Mayfield made music of integrity and truth that
cajoled the establishment; soothed, but never pitied, his
African-American brothers and sisters; and always sought to uplift
the race _ the human race.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago-born Mayfield began his career at a time when sweet
soul music mostly concerned itself with love lost and found. And
early on, as a member of the Impressions with Fred Cash and Sam
Gooden, Mayfield sang songs of romance such as ``Gypsy Woman'' and
``I'm So Proud,'' and his crystal tenor felt like a warm embrace.
There would always be love songs, but in a decade seared by racial
and social angst, Mayfield simply could not ignore the injustices
around him. In 1964, he wrote ``Keep on Pushing,'' a quietly
defiant song with gospel overtones that urged blacks to keep moving
toward equality. While Motown wanted to be the nonconfrontational
``Sound of Young America,'' Mayfield wanted to be its resilient
heart and political soul.
</P>
<P>
   Not that everyone was accepting of Mayfield's musical activism.
Some black radio stations as well as white stations were reluctant
to play his jubilant 1967 hit ``We're a Winner,'' which encouraged
blacks to keep ``moving on up'' and ``keep on pushing like your
leaders tell you to.'' With Newark and Detroit about to go up in
flames, the last thing some wanted was anyone telling already
riled-up black folks to do anything but sit and stew quietly.
</P>
<P>
   Later songs such as ``Choice of Colors'' and ``This Is My
Country,'' packed an even greater punch, and by the time Mayfield
went solo in the early 1970s, his songs were political manifestoes.
If ``Keep on Pushing'' was gentle and optimistic, there was no
mistaking the fire in songs such as (Don't Worry) If There's a Hell
Below, We're All Going to Go,'' ``We People Who Are Darker Than
Blue,'' and ``Mighty Mighty (Spade and Whitey).''
</P>
<P>
   Mayfield crafted great soundtracks such as ``Claudine,''
featuring Gladys Knight &AMP; the Pips, and ``Sparkle,'' with Aretha
Franklin, as well as the hit ``Giving Him Something He Could
Feel,'' which was later covered by En Vogue. But for many, Mayfield
hit his creative peak in 1972 with ``Superfly,'' his soundtrack for
the blaxploitation classic. It was inner-city life set to music, a
moody street opera about Priest, a Harlem street hustler looking
for one last score before going straight.
</P>
<P>
   In the quarter-century since the release of ``Superfly,'' many
hip-hop artists have incorporated its unforgettable beats and
images into their own recordings, but more often than not they've
missed the deeper point. Mayfield did not celebrate the criminal
life in ``Superfly''; this was no ghetto-fabulous opus. His was a
grim portrait of desperation and desolation with kid junkies who
would kill their mothers for that next fix in ``Little Child
Runnin' Wild,'' ill-fated small-time crooks in ``Freddie's Dead,''
and the dangerous wares of ``that nigga in the alley'' in
``Pusherman.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayfield's deceptively sweet voice was the sugarcoating for his
relentlessly hard dispatches. Little wonder the soundtrack was
inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1998 in recognition of its
``lasting, qualitative, historical significance.''
</P>
<P>
   It said a great deal when a 1994 tribute album to Curtis
Mayfield attracted artists as diverse as Bruce Springsteen, Whitney
Houston, Eric Clapton, Branford Marsalis, B.B. King, Elton John,
the Isley Brothers, Lenny Kravitz, and Stevie Wonder. The beauty of
Mayfield's music crossed arbitrary genre lines, and it remains
potent in both its musicality and its unbending messages of hope
and justice. At a time when so much contemporary music had
absolutely nothing on its mind, Mayfield always proved there is a
place _ and a need _ for music fashioned for the head as well as
the hips. Said Wonder, whose own social excursions in his music
were deeply influenced by Mayfield, ``For as long as there is
romance in love, the joy of pride, the power of words, the teaching
of right, and songs with haunting melodies, there will always be a
need for the music of Mayfield.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ It's rush hour, and the city that never sleeps could
definitely use a nap. Horns honk. Brakes squeal. At one point, what
sounds like a scream comes
</P>
<P>
   from the direction of Union Square, a few blocks away.
</P>
<P>
   Seven stories above lower Fifth Avenue _ in a building whose
street level houses nothing more exalted than an Au Bon Pain _ the
city's racket and grind seem hardly to exist. John Richardson is
giving a tour of his loft, a 5,000-square-foot monument to what the
poet Baudelaire celebrated as ``luxe, calme, et volupte'':
richness, quiet, and pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   ``These cards are New Year's presents from (Georges) Braque.
That's a (Robert) Rauschenberg, a painter I like enormously; he
gave it to me. Here's a rarity: the only copy of Andy Warhol's
graduation photograph _ it's inscribed down there. In the living
room, there's a portrait of me that Andy did. All these are Picasso
drawings. That's a 1st century Roman bust. Forced to pick just one
object here, it'd be that _ or the portrait of me by Lucian Freud
(we're dear friends: I've known Lucian since I was 17).
</P>
<P>
   ``After the war, in London, when I had hardly any money, I
bought this absolutely OK Salvator Rosa for 15 guineas, and this
early (Joshua) Reynolds for 7 1/2. Over there's a Frank Stella.
That's a Frank Auerbach over there, by those other paintings by
Lucian. A Julia Margaret Cameron photograph. I got this after a
whaling museum de-accessioned it: a whale's penis (`very Brancusi,'
Andy called it). Lots of extra stuff. I've jumbled everything up. I
hope it works. It's cozy.''
</P>
<P>
   They just don't make homes like John Richardson's anymore, or
lives, either. For many years the chief US representative of
Christie's, the international art auctioneers, he is the son of a
British quartermaster-general who was knighted for introducing
refrigeration during the Boer War, and the grandson, on his
mother's side, of a maid in the household of a British prime
minister, Lord Rosebery. The poet W. H. Auden once spied on
Richardson in flagrante, and Jacques Lacan briefly psychoanalyzed
him. Angus Wilson made him a character in his novel ``Hemlock and
After,'' and Warhol cast him in a soap opera (``Two pilots were
shot,'' Richardson confides, ``and I've been very careful never to
see them'').
</P>
<P>
   Above all, there is his unique place in the worlds of high art
and high society. Not since the Gilded Age, perhaps, has anyone on
this side of the Atlantic moved between them so effortlessly.
Richardson can claim friendship with both some of the century's
foremost artists _ Picasso, Braque, Fernand Leger, Francis Bacon,
Warhol, Freud, Ellsworth Kelly _ and a considerable portion of the
bold-face population of Page Six of the New York Post.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is adored by these people,'' says Wayne Lawson, executive
literary editor of Vanity Fair, where Richardson is a contributing
editor. ``Recently, he had his 75th birthday, and Annette de la
Renta and Mercedes Bass threw a party for him. If you wanted to
catch the creme de la creme of New York society, they were there,
everybody from Brooke Astor to Bill Blass to the (William F.)
Buckleys. Those are his warm, close friends.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not hard to see why. Some Englishmen, when they come to
America, try to outdo the royal family. Others go native.
Richardson, who moved to New York in the early 1960s, can be seen
as having done both. His great, square imperial face could belong
to a senior Whitehall diplomat, as might his melodious,
port-and-Stilton voice. Yet there's an eager-to-please casualness
to his manner that's winningly American. It makes for an
irresistible package: connoisseurship at its most companionable,
partygoing at its most patrician.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson is best known for his ongoing biography of Picasso.
Two volumes have been published, with two more to follow. ``A huge
achievement,'' says Gary Tinterow, author of ``Master Drawings by
Picasso'' and curator of 19th-century European paintings at New
York's Metropolitan Museum of Art. ``I can't imagine those books
being done any better.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What equipped Richardson to become Picasso's biographer _ among
other things _ is the subject of his new memoir, ``The Sorcerer's
Apprentice: Picasso, Provence, and Douglas Cooper.''
</P>
<P>
   The sorcerer is Cooper, a wealthy expatriate Englishman who
during his lifetime (1911-84) owned the greatest collection of
Cubist art in private hands. Richardson estimates that, at today's
prices, it would be worth half a billion dollars. Cruel,
cantankerous, witty, autocratic, equally quick to give and take
offense, Cooper was a version of Proust's Baron Charlus as imagined
by Evelyn Waugh. (He even looked a little like Waugh, with his
florid, moony face and penchant for loud checked tweeds.)
</P>
<P>
   For a dozen years, Richardson was his lover _ the sorcerer's
apprentice _ and they led an alternately magical and poisoned
existence at Castille, Cooper's art-filled estate in the south of
France. Through Cooper, Richardson became close to Picasso and
Braque and met a glittering array of social and cultural figures.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many people came to see us and the house because of the
pictures,'' Richardson recalls. He had been a gifted (and, as the
many photographs in ``The Sorcerer's Apprentice'' testify,
extremely good-looking) young man in the literary and artistic
swirl of postwar London when he met Cooper at a party in 1949. He
found himself transported to ``this very beautiful house in this
very beautiful part of the world with this fantastic collection . .
. and having this Tolstoyan bond of sharing one's reactions to
works of art with somebody else who was extremely intelligent and
had a very good eye and loved being a mentor.''
</P>
<P>
   The mentor also loved being a monster, however, and as
Richardson describes it there was very much a gilded-cage aspect to
his existence at Castille. Cooper would neither brook disagreement
nor let Richardson have a life of his own. It was, in fact,
Richardson's correcting a Cooper attribution (he'd mistaken a
forgery for a Leger) that led to a very ugly break in 1961. Soon
after, Richardson moved to New York.
</P>
<P>
   As his writing ``The Sorcerer's Apprentice'' indicates,
Richardson in no way disavows his years with Cooper. Indeed, he
dedicated the first volume of the Picasso biography to him. But the
book never really addresses a larger question: Did Richardson love
him?
</P>
<P>
   He reflects for several moments, expels a puff of air, then
gives a half-chuckle. ``Yes and no,'' he says. ``It's such a
difficult question to answer because there was something very
lovable, just as there was something very hatable, about Douglas.
He was such a paradox. Inside Douglas there was an angel and devil
constantly fighting for supremacy. The devil always won. But that
didn't stop the fact there was an angel _ well, a sort of angel, a
rather squashed angel _ and the angel was rather childlike and
surprisingly warm-hearted, and so, so funny. I loved that side of
Douglas. But the bad side, the black side, I have no idea how I
stood it.. . . He used up all the oxygen in whatever space he was
in, or so it seemed to me when I saw him again years later.''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson had no trouble adjusting to New York. ``I felt a bit
like a child let loose in a department store,'' he says. ``You
know, you could press the button in the elevator and go to a
different floor: There were so many layers of life that were
unfamiliar to me, so many different groups of people.''
</P>
<P>
   As much as New York, it was art that offered Richardson an
entree to such variety. The years he worked full time at Christie's
(he remains a consultant there) saw the transformation of the art
world, as it went from being a rarefied bastion of the elite to a
kind of high-class commodities market.
</P>

   ``It's become an enormous, zillion-dollar business,'' Richardson
says. When Douglas made his collection, he'd inherited half a
million dollars and set aside $150,000 (for acquisitions).. . .
These days, $150,000 would buy you one Picasso Cubist drawing, not
a very important one.. . . Much as I love art, I don't think any
painting is worth $50 million, $70 million; and, obviously, we're
soon going to have _ if we haven't had already, secretly _ a $100
million painting.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   It was after Richardson retired from Christie's, in the
mid-'80s, that he began work on the Picasso biography. The book had
its genesis many years before, however, while Richardson was living
at Castille, during a conversation with Dora Maar, Picasso's former
mistress. She pointed out to him how Picasso tended to change
artistic styles when he changed lovers. Richardson told this to
Picasso, who agreed. With this observation in mind, he decided to
do a book on Picasso's portraits.
</P>
<P>
   The move to America put the book on hold. When Richardson
resumed work on it, he realized a biography made more sense. The
original plan was for one volume, which soon became two, and now
four. It's unlikely to grow any further, if only for actuarial
reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never realized, when I started, what a huge task it was
going to be. I feel that, having had the luck to be in this
position,'' having known Picasso, ``I have a duty to fulfill it.. .
. I'm fairly vigorous and _ touch wood _ in fairly good shape. The
first one took five years, the second one four years, with any luck
the next one will take three. I'm 75, so I've got to hustle.''
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the publication of ``The Sorcerer's Apprentice,''
Richardson has gained a slightly different perspective on the
Picasso project. He gives a long, low laugh as he explains why.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of my friends who are not art historians or involved in
the art world found the (new) book well written. Well, it's written
the same way as the Picasso biography. Then I suddenly realized
that a whole mass of my friends who had bought the Picasso books
had not read them. They were amazed I could write at all!''

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ People with incurable diseases often come to see Dr.
Rafael Campo, hoping the Harvard-trained internist at Beth Israel
Deaconess Medical Center will prescribe medicine to lessen their
pain or announce a new cure for their illness.
</P>
<P>
   But many leave with something else. Something intangible and
unscientific, but still somehow strengthening: poetry.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Paul, a 49-year-old man who has spent the last four
years expecting to die soon from AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Paul had been living like a vegetable. He said his only reason
for waking up in the morning was to take his pills. Most days he
would lie on the bed listlessly, listening to the drone of radio
news.
</P>
<P>
   Then he met Campo, and with the doctor's prodding, found a more
compelling reason to rise out of bed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I had to get a life; otherwise I would have been dead,
like many of my friends,'' said Paul, who now walks around like a
healthy man. ``(The doctor) helped me find a voice, he was a role
model and a confidant.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many of Campo's patients, Paul took to writing. He wrote
constantly. Everything from poems to short stories to novels. Now
he has a Web site, and though he's still a sick man, he has
something to live for.
</P>
<P>
   Campo, a short, balding, and bespectacled physician who teaches
at Harvard Medical School, believes empathy and self-expression are
just as important to treating patients as are drugs and machines.
Often, he recommends readings or asks his patients to flesh out
their feelings in writing.
</P>
<P>
   An award-winning writer who has published books of poetry and
essays, the 35-year-old internist decries the distance doctors
typically keep from their patients and frequently offers personal
advice or recommends poems or books to the ailing men and women who
come see him.
</P>
<P>
   And though he knows the clinical limits of literature _ he has
no hope of curing a cancer victim with Baudelaire or Rilke _ he
doesn't discount its role in helping patients come to terms with
their illness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Poetry is a place where you can go and say, `Hey someone else
has been through this,' '' Campo said. `` `Someone else has made
sense of this experience. Maybe I can, too. Maybe I can even beat
this illness.' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``It puts people in touch with one another outside the
medicalized version of what's going to happen to them,'' he said.
``And I think that really helps.''
</P>
<P>
   Colleagues have mocked his efforts or warned him against getting
too close to patients. During his residency, one of his supervising
physicians told him his eagerness to empathize would hamper his
effectiveness as a doctor and be a ``boulder'' blocking an
otherwise bright career.
</P>
<P>
   But Campo has long defended treating illness with literature as
a way of healing the soul as much as the body. ``Patients don't
want a machine taking care of them,'' he says. ``They want a human
being.''
</P>
<P>
   And while his defense over the years has been mainly a visceral
one, he now cites science.
</P>
<P>
   A study published last April in the Journal of the American
Medical Association showed patients who wrote about their
illnesses, such as asthma and rheumatoid arthritis, suffered fewer
symptoms than those who didn't. In the study, 47 percent of the
patients who used writing as a form of treatment showed measurable
improvements in their health, while only 24 percent in a control
group saw their condition get better.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although it may be difficult to believe that a brief writing
exercise can meaningfully affect health,'' the authors concluded,
``this study replicates ... what a burgeoning literature indicates
in healthy individuals.''
</P>
<P>
   The study's results were not surprising to Campo. They validate
the school of treatment he and others call ``bibliotherapy,'' or
the use of reading and writing to help patients develop insight
into their illness in the hope it will aid their healing.
</P>
<P>
   Poetry, for example, is intrinsically soothing, he says, with
its rhythms that match the patterns of how we breathe, sob, or make
love.
</P>
<P>
   Campo himself has long turned to writing as a means of coming to
terms with his dual role of living in the mainstream wearing a
white coat and being a gay Cuban American.
</P>
<P>
   At times, he says, he thought about hanging up that white coat.
And for a while, he did. After his third year at Harvard Medical
School, he took a year off to study poetry at Boston University,
which bought him enough time to later win the open competition of
the prestigious National Poetry Series.
</P>
<P>
   While Campo still recoiled at what he viewed as the medical
profession's pervasive cynicism and materialism, he chose to press
on with medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Now, despite the pressures of seeing some 50 patients a week,
many of them with deadly diseases, he continues to write and push
his patients to express themselves. Last year, Duke University
Press published his poetry collection, ``Diva.''
</P>
<P>
   Though some are skeptical or even annoyed when Campo brings
along a set of poems to a consultation or writes up a prescription
for a patient to read a book such as Audre Lorde's ``The Cancer
Journals,'' patients like Paul say they benefit from bibliotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   The skinny patient with cropped hair and lines creasing his face
believes writing has been a major factor enabling him to survive
into the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm no longer concerned on a day-to-day basis about dying,''
he told Campo during a recent visit to Beth Israel. ``I have a new
identity. I'm no longer just an AIDS patient.''
</P>

CATCH LIMITS COMPEL `CRAZY' RISKS BY FISHERMEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ELLEN BARRY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTSMOUTH, N.H. _ Two days after Christmas, 70 miles out at
sea, the Coast Guard saved John Rosa's life, barely.
</P>
<P>
   At one point during the rescue, he stood in the gathering dark,
losing hope, with waves breaking through the forecastle of his
37-foot boat, when a Coast Guard marksman shot out a lifeline that
actually wrapped around his forearm.
</P>
<P>
   During the 14-hour journey home, Rosa had to climb into a cocoon
of mattresses and lash himself to his boat to avoid breaking bones
as he smashed into the ceiling, then the floor, and then the
ceiling again.
</P>
<P>
   Rosa, 36, of Kittery, Maine, returned to the Portsmouth
Fishermen's Coop on Monday with the peculiar celebrity of someone
who has almost been swallowed up. Although the Bella Julia would
not have been stranded if its transmission had not failed,
fishermen who know Rosa said there was more to his predicament than
pure bad luck. Most of them said Rosa was one of the few fishermen
who would be tough enough, or desperate enough, to steam 70
nautical miles out in a boat that small, on Christmas, when no one
was at sea to respond to distress calls. Some even described the
risks he took as ``crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   But no one blamed him for taking them. To blame, they argue, are
fishery regulators who have set limits on cod catches so low that
fishermen are forced to risk their lives to make a living.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been like that for a while,'' said Bud Fernandes, 38, of
the dangerous trips that Rosa has been taking. ``In general, we are
judgmental (of the risks other fishermen take), but right now, the
industry's so desperate that we're like in survival mode.
Desperation drives the decision process. It degrades it.''
</P>
<P>
   And so John Rosa's trial at sea has become evidence in a
long-simmering conflict over restrictions that became far stricter
this past summer, as biologists warned that the fishery was in
danger of collapse. The complaints don't just have to do with cod,
and they aren't just coming from Portsmouth _ the Gloucester
(Mass.) Fisheries Commission two weeks ago urged the New England
Fisheries Management Council to relax regulations so that fishermen
could return to port, rather than wait at sea until they've been
out long enough to justify the amount of fish they've caught. That
practice has put several Gloucester fishing boats at risk over the
past two months as the weather deteriorated, according to David
Lincoln, an environmental consultant for the Massachusetts
Fishermen's Partnership.
</P>
<P>
   But officials at the Fisheries Management Council, which sets
catch limits for 20 species in the region, said they can't be held
responsible for a fisherman's brinkmanship. Since the inshore
fisheries preferred by Portsmouth fishermen were shut down, Rosa is
the first to blame his misfortune on the regulations, said Patricia
Fiorelli, the council's public affairs officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's most unfortunate that he got himself into that
position, but there are choices being made out there. . . . How far
to go out, what size boat to take out, whether to take a crew,
those are all individual decisions,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Fiorelli added that the council is ``roundly criticized'' by
conservationists for not imposing stricter limits, even as the
fishermen protest that they're being edged into bankruptcy. ``It's
a real balancing act,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   When Rosa tells the story of his rescue, though, it begins and
ends with economics. On Dec. 22, he looked back at the worst
financial year of his life, a year when he went through a divorce
that he traced to tension over money. There are good reasons not to
fish on Christmas; no one else does, so a captain in distress would
have no one to call for help. The flip side is that prices go up.
Pollock, for example, sold for $1.79 a pound early last week, up
from a regular price of 70 cents a pound. Rosa, a father of three,
was looking to pay for Christmas presents.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to afford to lose the 20 percent share that a crewman
would demand, Rosa steamed out alone in the calm cold that day.
Four hours and about 25 nautical miles into the trip, Rosa passed
over Jeffrey's Ledge, a favorite inshore spot for generations of
Portsmouth cod fishermen. Since the Fisheries Management Council
has shut down Jeffrey's Ledge, he had to steam 45 nautical miles
farther, to Fippennies Ledge _ a ``dead zone'' where cell phones
and radios can't reach land, but a fishing ground, shallower than
the surrounding waters.
</P>
<P>
   On Christmas Eve, said Rosa, ``the Lord was good to me.'' He
hauled in 2,000 pounds of pollock while staying below the federal
cod limit of 100 pounds. But when he tried to turn back, early on
Christmas Day, he had a dead transmission. He went to work on his
engine and tried radioing for help. No one heard him.
</P>
<P>
   As Saturday night rolled into Sunday morning, things got
dramatically worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden, I picked my head up and saw a big wall of
water,'' said Rosa. Twelve- and 14-foot waves, and an occasional
18-footer, were drifting him toward the edge of Fippennies Ledge,
his anchor dragging across the ocean floor. The water rose on his
deck and began breaking through the forecastle, ``blowing through
one doorway and out the other side.''
</P>
<P>
   At 5 in the morning, his computer registered a jump in speed,
from zero to 2.2 knots: He had slipped off the ledge. No one in the
world knew where he was. He figured he would sink in six hours.
</P>
<P>
   Rosa never had much faith in the Emergency Position Indicating
Radio Beacon, or EPIRB, that federal regulations had required him
to carry since 1988. ``I bitched and moaned about buying that thing
for so long,'' he said. But at 6:43 a.m., having run out of
options, he set it off.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, at 6:48, a Coast Guard officer was on the phone
with Rosa's girlfriend on land. At about 8, a voice spoke out of
his radio: a jet was circling over the Bella Julia, passing again
and again, and would not leave him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just like an angel,'' he said. ``I heard his voice, and
it was like he was right next to me.''
</P>
<P>
   All day, the Coast Guard crews hovered over the tossing Bella
Julia, maintaining visual contact with Rosa, who refused to leave
his boat, which is not insured. At 3 p.m., the cutter Vigorous
arrived and shot line after line across the Bella Julia's bow, only
to have them knocked into the water by the wind, until, as dark was
falling and Rosa was losing hope, a length of line blew up against
him and wrapped around his arm.
</P>
<P>
   The journey back to port was 70 nautical miles and took 14
hours. Rosa was thrown up and down inside the forecastle so
violently that he described it as ``being nailed to the ceiling,
then nailed to the floor, then nailed to the ceiling again.'' The
crew on the Vigorous used the lifeline to send back a plastic bag
containing a still-warm dinner of chicken and rice, but after three
days without food, his stomach had shrunk so much he could only eat
a few bites.
</P>
<P>
   Back at the Fishermen's Coop, Rosa's friends poured him cups of
hot coffee and congratulated him on being alive. He slept for 20
hours. But he headed back to sea on New Year's Eve, hoping another
holiday run would make him enough money to pay for the repairs to
his boat. And no one _ certainly not Peter Kendall, manager of the
Coop _ could guarantee that it wouldn't happen again.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's crazy. He shouldn't be doing it,'' said Kendall. ``I
said, `John, that's your eighth life.' But the next week he might
be out there again.''
</P>
<P>
   Dave Damon, a 50-year-old fisherman, says he knows exactly why
Rosa goes so far out. Damon has reduced his expenses to $200 a
month in anticipation of narrower profit margins in coming years,
but when he talks about government regulators it's with seething
anger. Given the choice between ending his fishing career and
taking risks, he will opt for the risks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to roll over and die. I'm not going to jump into
that homeless shelter in Portsmouth,'' he said. ``In 12 years,
maybe I'll make it to Social Security, but maybe I won't. Maybe
I'll be steaming out there with Rosa.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You put anyone in a corner and they're going to go extreme,''
he said.

BIG YEAR FOR EVENTS AROUND THE WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY MORRIS  
 c.2000   The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Welcome to the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   For travelers, this definitely marks a new beginning in the way
we book trips, think of vacations, and travel.
</P>
<P>
   Even countries are looking forward to new beginnings in travel.
For Australia, when the Olympic flame will be lit on Sept. 15, it
will also mark a new era in tourism there. John Morse, managing
director of Australian Tourist Commission, notes, ``After the
Olympics in September, the way the world sees Australia will have
changed forever. It is a change that will have a profound impact on
Australia's place in the world. . . . In short, it will give the
world even more reasons to holiday, do business, or study in
Australia.''
</P>
<P>
   It's also a significant year for events, and one for religious
pilgrimages.
</P>
<P>
   The welcome mat is out around the world. Scotland, for example,
has produced a new guide ``Scotland 2000 _ Now is the Time.'' The
guide is designed to entice visitors from around the world. With
the establishment just last year of the first Scottish Parliament
in 300 years, the country is bursting with renewed confidence and
promising lots to do and see.
</P>
<P>
   With this being the 2,000th birthday of Jesus, Israel will be
the number one destination for many. Even Pope John Paul II is
expected to visit Holy Land sites in both Israel and Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Rome has been busy sprucing up for 2000; this is a Jubilee Year
for the Roman Catholic Church. The city and the Vatican are
spending $6 billion to refurbish 700 historic sites, widen streets,
set up information sites, plan for emergency medical services, and
more.
</P>
<P>
   On Christmas Eve, Pope John Paul II officially launched the
Jubilee by opening a special holy door at St. Peter's Basilica. The
Jubilee is a secial religious festival held every 25 years. It was
first declared by Pope Boniface VIII in 1300. This year's Jubilee,
being held on the 2,000th year since the birth of Jesus, is
special. Following church tradition, Pope John Paul II has
established special indulgences for the faithful who visit
religious sites during 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Italy is also planning Jubilee celebrations throughout the
country. ``Tourists visiting Italy during the Jubilee will have the
opportunity to see newly restored sites including St. Peter's
Basilica in Rome and St. Francis's Basilica in Assisi,'' said
Eugenio Magnani, director of the Italian Tourist Board in New York.
``We are also proud to announce the reopening of the Palermo Opera
House in Sicily after 27 years of renovation and the Regional
Modern Art Gallery in Naples after 40 years of restoration, both of
which are now open to an entire generation that is yet to
experience these cultural wonders.''
</P>
<P>
   Oberammergau, Germany's famed Passion Play, which has run every
10 years since 1633, will be held May 22-Oct. 8. Some 2,000 of the
village's 5,300 inhabitants participate in the play, which began
when villagers vowed to reenact the last days of Christ's life if
they would be spared from further Black Plague deaths. There were
no more deaths, and the people of Oberammergau kept their promise.
This year's presentation has a revised text, new scenery and
costumes, and $14 million in theater improvements, including more
comfortable seating. The play is some eight hours long, with a
lunch break provided. Individual tickets are reportedly sold out,
but travelers can still find tour packages that include tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Annually the American Bus Association names the Top 100 Events
for North America. Leading the list for 2000 in the United States
is OpSail 2000, which takes place May 25 through July 31 in eight
port cities including San Juan; Miami; ; Norfolk, Va.; Baltimore;
Philadelphia; New York City; New London, Conn.; and Portland,
Maine. For Canada, the top event is the Shaw Festival, held in
beautiful Niagara-on-the-Lake, Ontario, April through November.
</P>
<P>
   Europe annually names one city as its Cultural Capital, but this
year nine cities will carry the mantle of European City of Culture
_ Bergen, Norway; Helsinki; Avignon, France; Krakow, Poland;
Reykjavik, Iceland; Prague; Santiago de Compostela, Spain; Bologna,
Italy; and Brussels. The idea behind the Cultural Capital was to
expose a city's unique cultural offerings and its affinities with
the arts worldwide. While each city is free to determine its own
emphasis, this year the nine Cities of Culture will also
collaborate on many projects.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet is drawing more and more travelers to on-line
bookings. There is a tempting menu of offerings, all ng the
lowest air fares, and some encouraging bidding on travel for a real
bargain. With airlines cutting out just about all commissions on
ticket sales, and more people looking for bargains on the Internet,
travel agencies are feeling the pinch, with many closing.
</P>
<P>
   While the Internet is increasingly changing the way we book
trips, for many people, the biggest problem with travel is finding
the time to get away.
</P>
<P>
   Shorter vacations are in. So tour operators are refocusing their
packages. Abercrombie &AMP; Kent has created ``Just a Week Away''
vacations that incorporate ``all the pleasures and benefits of a
longer trip.''
</P>
<P>
   As evidenced by the lack of travel during New Year's, many
Americans are also balking at paying high prices. Gone are the days
of Arthur Frommer's ``Europe on $5 a Day,'' but prices of $60 a day
are possible. Trafalgar Tours is featuring a Cost Saver Program
that it says will allow travelers to experience culture, history,
and culinary specialties at prices averaging 10 percent less than
last year. Trafalgar says some of its tours average $60 a day,
others $73 to $80 a day. Even TNT Vacations, a Boston budget travel
organization, will offer European trips that will not only be
competitively priced but also designed to offer a more intimate and
relaxed experience.
</P>
<P>
   Travelers are also tending to get away from passive sightseeing,
looking instead for challenges ranging from physical to
educational. Rejuvenation by visiting a spa seems to be another
growing vacation trend. And others are looking for personal
indulgences. ``Bath Menus'' can be found at the Ritz-Carlton,
Asia-Pacific Hotels. Baths designed to eliminate jet lag, promote
restful sleep, invigorate, or create a restful mood can be booked
at the time of reservation and ready when one arrives. There's even
a bath butler ready to draw the water and create the perfect
bathing atmosphere. Baths average $30, and are proving so popular
that Mark Lettenbichler, general manager of the Ritz-Carlton, Hong
Kong, says he's had inquiries about baths-only reservations.
</P>
<P>
   Wouldn't it be wonderful if there were a theme park without
lines or rushing about? This summer SeaWorld will be opening a new
park in Orlando, Fla., that will be by reservation only and without
lines or huge crowds. SeaWorld also promises that its new Discovery
Cove will offer ``once-in-a-lifetime'' opportunities deep in the
heart of Florida. Discovery Cove will be located adjacent to
SeaWorld, but will be a separate park. The park will offer visitors
a chance to swim with dolphins and have a coral reef for swimmers
and snorkelers filled with thousands of tropical fish, a ray lagoon
where guests can play with hundreds of southern and cownose
stingrays, an aviary where 30 species of birds will live, and
beaches and pools.

   Last year Cedar Point in Sandusky, Ohio, was voted the Best
Amusement Park in the World and had its Magnum XL-200 named the
Best Steel Roller Coaster in the World. ``Amusement park
enthusiasts around the globe can't seem to get enough of Cedar
Point,'' said Gary Slade, editor of Amusement Today, which made the
awards. ``It's one of those rare places that has succeeded in
blending its rich history and tradition with the most
state-of-the-art thrill rides _ all surrounded by a charming
old-time resort atmosphere.'' Not content to rest on its laurels,
Cedar Point will introduce still another coaster, Millennium Force,
which this year will become the tallest and fastest roller coaster
in the world. Standing 310 feet tall and reaching 92 miles an hour,
Millennium Force will be Cedar Point's 14th roller coaster. The
park will have more coasters than anywhere else on earth.

CATHOLICS FEAR LOSS OF FREEDOMS IN NEW MACAO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By INDIRA A.R. LAKSHMANAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MACAO _ Four hundred years after this Portuguese trading post
became the cornerstone of the Roman Catholic mission in the Far
East, only 22,000 Catholics remain and its once-famous seminary has
closed.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Macao has reverted to Beijing's control, the diocese
that once ruled over all churches in China and Japan is facing its
greatest challenge yet. A Roman Catholic Church that for centuries
was arguably more powerful than the government itself will have to
survive and thrive in a country whose leadership does not even
recognize the Vatican.
</P>
<P>
   China has promised that Macao, like the former British colony of
Hong Kong, will continue to enjoy freedom of religion, civil
liberties, a Western legal tradition, and a capitalist economy for
at least 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   Macao's Catholics are banking on that vow, and most dismiss
comparisons to mainland China, where the communist government
controls the ``official'' church, and where Catholics loyal to the
Vatican worship in illegal, underground churches.
</P>
<P>
   Yet some worry that the Chinese government, historically
suspicious of influential religious movements, may exert a slow
squeeze on free worship in Macao. That may already have begun, with
the arrest and deportation last month of members of Falun Gong, a
Chinese sect based on Buddhism, Taoism, and breathing exercises
that Beijing has outlawed on the mainland as a cult. Falun Gong
remains legal in Macao and Hong Kong, but just as Macao was
returned to China, its members were accused of illegal assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Catholics represent just 5 percent of Macao's population but are
a visible and powerful minority. Most of its civil servants
generally had been Portuguese Catholics, and many prominent civic
leaders are Chinese or Eurasian Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   Catholic culture is evident everywhere in Macao, from religious
statues and street names, to Christmas tunes piped into restaurants
and giant Nativity scenes in public squares.
</P>
<P>
   Half of Macao's children study at Catholic schools, and most
social services are church-based. With 33 Catholic churches, Macao
is the only Chinese city with more churches than temples. Lisbon
and Beijing have agreed that the historic structures, like Macao's
other meticulously preserved colonial buildings, will be protected.
But what of the worshipers themselves?
</P>
<P>
   ``I have some concerns for the future of our church, but I don't
have a sense of being in danger,'' Macao's Bishop Domingos Lam said
last month.
</P>
<P>
   Recent reports state that the Vatican and Beijing might
establish diplomatic ties early this year, with the Vatican
agreeing to sever ties with Taiwan, and Beijing allowing the pope
to choose bishops and a cardinal from an approved list. That could
markedly improve conditions for underground Catholics on the
mainland, and in turn, alleviate fears among Catholics here. But
for now, that is speculation, and worshipers here have their
worries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course there will be problems,'' said Lola Rozario, a
Portuguese who has lived here for 30 years and has no intention of
leaving. But for now, she said, motioning to Macao's cathedral,
``You can see how many are here today.''
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 19 at 11 a.m., an emotional crowd crammed into the pale
yellow, centuries-old cathedral to celebrate the last Mass under
colonial rule. As the sun streamed through the stained glass into
the airy, vaulted interior, several hundred ethnic Chinese,
Eurasians, and Portuguese spilled into the aisles and crowded
behind the last pews to hear Bishop Lam officiate.
</P>
<P>
   Lam, the first Chinese bishop of Macao since the diocese was
established in 1576, addressed worshipers in Portuguese. After the
changeover, ceremonies in Chinese were planned.
</P>
<P>
   In a striking departure from tradition, alongside wine and bread
sanctified at the altar, offerants presented a miniature colonial
facade representing the past _ the Jesuits' contribution to Macao _
and a book symbolizing the future under the Basic Law, Macao's new
constitution.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the Portuguese first arrived in Macao it was a moment of
confidence, of foundation, a moment that became historical. In this
time of departure, we hope that it will again be a historical
moment of confidence, a meeting point of evangelization,'' the Rev.
Joao Lourenco told the congregants in Portuguese.
</P>
<P>
   It was a message of optimism echoed by many others, including
the most influential member of Macao's Catholic clergy, Monsignor
Manuel Teixeira, an 87-year-old Portuguese who came to Macao as a
12-year-old seminarian.
</P>
<P>
   With his flowing white beard, owlish black-rimmed glasses, and
plain white robe, Teixeira has been a priest for 65 years and has
become a universally recognized figure in Macao. He believes
Macao's church can withstand any pressures China might impose. The
church has faced all sorts of persecution in the last 2,000 years,
he noted, and nothing has destroyed it.
</P>
<P>
   But Teixeira doubts that China will try to suppress religion
here, since Macao and Hong Kong are ``a test for China'' _ a chance
to prove that the capitalist island of Taiwan could safely reunify
with the communist mainland.
</P>
<P>
   He also dismissed the suggestion that Catholicism could wane
because many Portuguese have left. Macao will merely experience a
natural evolution from a Portuguese-dominated church to a
Chinese-dominated one, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the church, all are equal. . . . Before, we said Mass in
Latin. Today, we say Mass in whatever language people speak,'' said
Teixeira, who celebrates Mass in eight languages. Four local
churches offer Mass in Cantonese, the local dialect.
</P>
<P>
   One complaint among local Catholics is that church weddings are
now merely ceremonial, requiring a civil service to be valid. But
Teixeira says these are minor cavils and vows that Catholicism will
keep growing here.
</P>
<P>
   But keeping any religion alive requires new followers, a
challenge dogging Macao's aging clergy, who have largely failed to
reach the flood of 200,000 mainland immigrants who have doubled
Macao's population since the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Luis Lei Xavier, a Chinese Macao native and rector of
St. Joseph Seminary, should know. The seminary, once the
headquarters for Catholic clerical education in Asia, closed in
1972.
</P>
<P>
   Lei calls the period of inactivity at the seminary ``not too
long in the history of the Catholic Church'' but admits that
Macao's Catholic community is much depleted from its peak following
World War II, when missionaries and lay Catholics fled the
communist revolution in mainland China.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Macao's Catholics have scattered across the world,
and Macao's population has swelled with mainlanders, who are being
converted now at a rate of about 100 a year, Lei said. Within five
years, he predicts, the seminary will be allowed to accept students
from China and will reopen.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the church is facing is the challenge of new people
coming into Macao with different traditions, a communist tradition,
a different way of reasoning,'' he said. ``Our mission now is to .
. . value everyone's tradition, to allow the church to be a place
for everyone to learn from each other, not to impose.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the arrest last month of more than 30 Falun Gong
followers as they were exercising in a park raised his concerns
about freedom of religion in the new Macao, Lei said no, asserting
that it was fair for China or any nation to define certain groups
as sects and not religions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our advantage in the Macao Catholic Church is that we are so
small, we can't be a threat to the communist party or anybody,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Emerging from the Dec. 19 Mass, Antonio Lo, a 75-year-old native
of China's Guangdong province who converted when he moved here 30
years ago, said the church should not get involved in politics.
Catholicism will falter only if the people of Macao become
complacent, he said. There will be no problems with China ``as long
as we retain our faith.''

an easier test that patients can perform themselves without having
to undergo a pelvic exam by a doctor. To do the test, a woman would
use a cotton swab to collect a sample of vaginal cells, which would
then be sent to a laboratory to be analyzed. According to two
studies being published today in the Journal of the American
Medical Association, the new test is as good or better than the Pap
test at detecting cancer and precancerous changes in the cervix.
Doctors say that because the new test is so quick and easy, it
holds great promise for the many women who do not receive Pap

   TECH-HELP-DESK (Undated) _ At a time when millions of
white-collar workers depend on a desktop computer to perform
virtually every function of their job, computer help-desk employees
are fast achieving a position once held by the office secretary. In
a subtle shift of workplace politics, they have become the people
whose affection smart colleagues are going to great lengths to win.
Indeed, as the number of secretaries has declined by about one
million, or 25 percent, over the last two decades, technology _ in
the form of voice mail and e-mail _ has taken over many of their
old tasks. So last month, as the gift-giving of the December
holidays has coincided with worries over year 2000 computer
problems, help-desk workers across the country have been bombarded
with homemade cookies, chocolate samplers, trinkets and thank-you
notes that are carbon-copied to top executives.

not from an ordinary business consultant. No, Patch hired Tom
Morris, a professional philosopher, to impart to him the wisdom of
the ages. And, by carefully studying the admonitions of such seers
as Aristotle, Plato, Seneca and Machiavelli, and applying them to
the management of his firm, he says, it has flourished. By Abby

&HT;     LAST `BATTLE' OF WORLD WAR I FOUGHT IN TEXAS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DAVID ANTHONY RICHELIEU  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ The small commemorative booklet, more than 80
years old, tells of a grand military spectacle at what was then
called Brooks Field.
</P>
<P>
   Diane Wieman knows the story inside out. Her grandfather, E.G.
Gilbert, took part in what was known as the ``Sham Battle'' on Nov.
30, 1918.
</P>
<P>
   Just days after the end of World War I, San Antonians flocked to
Brooks Field to watch a coordinated assault by thousands of Army
troops lasting less than an hour. In that fleeting time, the
Americans defeated the Imperial German forces and captured the
Kaiser and the crown prince.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans at Brooks Field triumphed more decisively than did
the Allied armies that fought their way to the Nov. 11, 1918,
armistice on the real battlefields of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   At first, the event sounds almost like a grotesque joke by
rambunctious troops celebrating the end of a horrific war. At the
very least, it seems a display of bad taste just three weeks after
peace.
</P>
<P>
   But to the military brass assembled at Brooks from around the
country, to the more than four dozen pilots, thousands of infantry
and their support units participating, the Sham Battle demonstrated
the depth and versatility of America's emerging military might.
</P>
<P>
   It got the attention of the newspapers. They carried detailed
descriptions of how infantry, horse-mounted as well as new
motorized cavalry vehicles, and a flying armada of aircraft engaged
in an hourlong mock war with ``German'' troops.
</P>
<P>
   Gilbert, Wieman's grandfather, participated in the battle at
Brooks. Photos show him with the rest of air corps Squadron D. The
pictures are in ``The Men Who Made Brooks Field,'' a 70-page
commemorative booklet (limited to 1,000 copies) Maverick-Clarke
Litho Co. of San Antonio (now Clarke Printing Co.) printed for the
occasion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was amazing,'' Wieman said. ``I found it in grandfather's
trunk after he died in 1976. He spent most of his military career
at Brooks. He started off flying there and later became an
instructor.''
</P>
<P>
   Brooks Heritage Society executive director Shelia Klein shares
Wieman's enthusiasm for the unusual event.
</P>
<P>
   Photos of the battleground at what is now Brooks Air Force Base
show a long row of civilian cars and onlookers lined up between the
hangars and the warring armies. Plumes of ``deadly'' gas spread
hundreds of yards through battlefield trenches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hospital planes'' evacuated the wounded on special stretchers
fixed atop the rear cockpit openings of two-seater ``J''
Artillery reduced an elegant three-story ``chateau'' to rubble in
seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Crowds watched in awe as wave after wave of planes swooped from
the sky in attack formation as troops staged mass assaults amid the
deafening roar of gunfire, grenade and bomb blasts. Explosions
filled the air with clouds of smoke, dirt and dust.
</P>
<P>
   The Kaiser and crown prince were captured and paraded before
hundreds of ``Germans'' assembled in formation after surrendering
to the overwhelming American onslaught.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea was to demonstrate to the citizens and to invited
military officials how American forces were prepared to carry out a
coordinated assault involving all elements of the armed forces,''
Klein said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a one-time event. The preparations had been under way
for months, and ranking officers from across the country attended.
The fact that it occurred right after the end of World War I
appears to have been a coincidence,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   A giddy sense of celebration was evident in the booklet's
narrative and in photos like one of stacked cases of bourbon and
other liquor in the officers' club that was ``taken at great
personal risk by our special correspondent in San Antonio.''
</P>
<P>
   Klein had read about the event from prints in the Brooks
archives made from negatives of the pages. The base doesn't have an
actual copy of the booklet, wcludes a detailed chronology of
the creation and initial operation of Brooks as the major military
pilot-training facility in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Wieman and Klein recently met at Hangar 9 on Brooks Air Force
Base and looked through Wieman's booklet, trading pilot stories and
laughing at the written humor about the battle.
</P>
<P>
   They later went outside to compare how the area around Hangar 9
looked during the Sham Battle and how it looks today. The 16
original hangars each had a large number painted on them, making it
easy to spot Hangar 9 and see what it looked like 81 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine what it must have been like,'' Klein said.

MIRANDA PROTECTS SUSPECTS AND POLICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 (EDITOR'S NOTE: Charles Levendosky, editorial page editor of the
Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune, has a national reputation for First
Amendment commentary. His e-mail address is
levendos(AT-sign)trib.com.)  
(gm) 
 By CHARLES LEVENDOSKY   
 c.2000 Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In its decision in Miranda vs. Arizona (1966), the U.S. Supreme
Court actually adopted the Miranda warning from criminal procedures
already used by the FBI. The high court adopted the warning in
order to safeguard the Fifth Amendment right against
self-incrimination for those in police custody.
</P>
<P>
   The warning has three essential elements: A person taken into
custody must be advised immediately that he has a right to remain
silent, that anything he says may be used against him in a court of
law and that he has the right to speak to a retained or
court-appointed attorney before submitting to interrogation.
</P>
<P>
   The court in the Miranda decision wrote: ``Over the years the
Federal Bureau of Investigation has compiled an exemplary record of
effective law enforcement while advising any suspect or arrested
person, at the outset of an interview.... A letter received from
the Solicitor General in response to a question from the Bench
makes it clear that the present pattern of warnings and respect for
the rights of the individual followed as a practice by the FBI is
consistent with the procedure which we delineate today.''
</P>
<P>
   In the First Congress, Sen. William Maclay of Pennsylvania spoke
in opposition to a proposed law that would have compelled a person
to be a witness against himself in civil cases: ``extorting
evidence from any person was a species of torture.... The
conscience was to be put on the rack; that forcing oaths or
evidence from men, I consider equalnnical as extorting
evidence by torture.''
</P>
<P>
   In his book, ``Origins of the Bill of Rights,'' pre-eminent
constitutional scholar Leonard W. Levy maintains that the right
against self-incrimination is inserted in the Fifth Amendment and
not the Sixth Amendment because the framers of our Constitution did
not want the right to be merely applied to a defendant during a
trial.
</P>
<P>
   The Sixth Amendment spells out the constitutional rights of
defendants in a criminal trial. Most of the clauses of the Fifth
Amendment may be seen as protecting the rights of suspects or those
accused prior to trial. In other words, the right against
self-incrimination can be evoked when a person is still a suspect
and not yet a defendant.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Supreme Court examined the question of whether
confessions were coerced or voluntary long before it threw out the
conviction of a black man who had been repeatedly hanged by his
belt until unconscious then revived and questioned again until he
confessed (Brown vs. Mississippi, 1936).
</P>
<P>
   Though rare, in a few police precincts around the nation,
physical threats and actual violence are still used to obtain
confessions. When those methods are brought to the court's
attention, those convictions are usually overturned.
</P>
<P>
   In a line of cases from the 1940s to the 1960s, the high court
began to recognize that suspects needed to have an attorney present
when they were taken into custody in order to preserve the fairness
of a trial.
</P>
<P>
   Pretrial interrogation is the stage when legal aid and advice
are most critical to a suspect, said the court in its Escobedo vs.
Illinois (1964) decision.
</P>
<P>
   In the Miranda case, the court also recognized that the
interrogation techniques as outlined in police manuals can lead to
menacing psychological stratagems that undermine the right against
self-incrimination.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to the Miranda ruling, there were thousands of appeals
regarding whether a confession was voluntary or not. Few reached
the U.S. Supreme Court. Those appeals that did reach the court were
mostly death penalty cases. After t court mandated the
Miranda warning, fewer appeals have been made based upon
involuntary confessions.
</P>
<P>
   In general, the Miranda warning acts as a watershed in
determining the admission of a confession in a court of law. Was
the suspect read his Miranda rights before he was interrogated? If
not, in most circumstances, any confession would be suppressed.
</P>
<P>
   When it rules in Dickerson vs. United States this term, if the
Supreme Court decides to overturn its Miranda decision in favor of
the less stringent standards regarding the voluntariness of
confessions, which were passed by Congress in 1968, then a great
many more appeals regarding confessions will reach the courts. And,
once again, the high court will hear very few of them.
</P>
<P>
   Some claim that the Miranda decision has hampered police, that
thousands of criminals have been let free and thousands of crimes
go unsolved each year because of the requirement to read suspects
their Miranda rights.
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts claim those assertions are phony.
</P>
<P>
   Former New York City Police Commissioner William Bratton, in a
Dec. 12 interview with Michael Kramer of the New York Daily News,
said that Miranda has not impeded police work: ``The falling crime
rates tell you that, if nothing else does.''
</P>
<P>
   Bratton made the argument that Miranda protects law enforcement
officials from the suspicion that they coerced a confession from
someone in their custody. Under Miranda, police have a suspect sign
a paper saying he has been read his rights. Any defendant, who then
claims his confession was coerced, has a harder time proving that
in court.
</P>
<P>
   Miranda strikes a balance in protecting a citizen's right
agaif-incrimination and protecting law enforcement officials
from an unfair suspicion that back-room, third-degree techniques
were used to obtain a confession.
</P>
<P>
   We live in a constitutional, democratic republic where even the
police must adhere to constitutional standards. And while the
police solve crimes, they must still protect the civil rights of
suspects. Without the public's trust, law enforcement is hampered.
Miranda has helped establish that trust.
   Miranda has worked for more than 30 years _ it would be worse
than foolish to dump it now.

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: A New Year's baby for the new
century
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUFKIN, Texas _ My wife and I stayed home New Year's Eve,
watching on TV the celebrations around the world. By the time we
went to bed, midnight in Texas thereabouts, I was deeply regretful
that we had not gone somewhere and done something extra special _
to New Zealand or to Paris _ as some of our friends had.
</P>
<P>
   That was then. Two hours later, everything changed.
</P>
<P>
   The phone rang, waking me from my deeply regretful sleep. I
fumbled to answer it. My daughter Kate was on the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me speak to Mother,'' she said, evenly.
</P>
<P>
   Something was wrong. I knew that much instantly, and I wanted to
hear it firsthand from her. I always expect the worst, maybe that
the dam broke. I wasn't that far off.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is it?'' I demanded.
</P>
<P>
   ``My water broke,'' she said, evenly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here, talk to your mother,'' I said, and handed off the phone.
</P>
<P>
   It was a heck of a deal. She's our youngest, 26. The baby wasn't
due for three weeks. Her husband, Keith, was in the hospital where
they live, Waco, with pneumonia, hooked up to IVs and oxygen.
</P>
<P>
   She had a touch of pneumonia herself but not so bad that she
needed to be hospitalized. She was staying there with him in the
room. During the night she got to coughing so hard that it got the
baby's attention.
</P>
<P>
   My wife talked quietly to my daughter for a minute or two while
I occupied myself by running around in circles as if one foot were
nailed to the floor. Then she hung up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's go back to sleep,'' she said. ``Nothing's going to
happen for a while. We can get up in the morning and drive over.''
</P>
<P>
   Which was the sensible thing to do. Never mind I was already
halfway dressed. Lucky for me I don't have a willy-nilly wife or
willy-nilly daughters. I'm willy-nilly enough for all of us.
</P>
<P>
   We drove the three hours to W next morning, arriving in
plenty of time. The baby arrived 1 1/2 hours later, William Joseph,
named for the two grandfathers, and born on the afternoon of the
first day of the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The father managed to be on hand as well, garbed in mask and
gown and protective gloves to keep from spreading pneumonia germs,
shuffling to the delivery room accompanied by a rolling IV pole.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody is just fine, thank you.
</P>
<P>
   Keith's mother and grandmother were there, too, just in time.
His mother, all the way from Lubbock in far West Texas, had come
directly after what she described as a hysterical call from him.
He's a boy after my own heart.
</P>
<P>
   They stayed to help with the baby. We came on back home. Next
week it'll be our turn to stay.
</P>
<P>
   By the time we went to bed, early even for us, I was deeply
thankful we had stayed home for New Year's Eve. Whatever the
celebrations worldwide, none could have compared to ours.

perfection: all meat, tender but still a little firm, succulent,

is knowing they are available only for a few months _ crab season

close to where they are caught, on Biscayne Bay, on Florida's Gulf
Coast and in the Keys. By Steven Raichlen.

   TOMATOES (Undated) _ The great Chilean poet Pablo Neruda called
tomatoes ``the stars of the earth,'' which ``grant us the festival
of ardent color and all-embracing freshness.'' Today, Neapolitan
tomatoes are acknowledged as the best in the world. They have thin
skins, a vibrant red color, dense yet tender flesh and, most
important, an ideal balance between acid and sweetness. The best
variety originally came from a village near Pompeii named San
Marzano sul Sarno. These tomatoes, which gave birth to the Italian
canning industry in the 1800s, are now grown throughout Campania.

   PRE-DINNER-DRINK (New York) _ The other evening I sat in a dim
bar sipping a glass of Champagne and unwinding, taking in the
room's rich reds and lacquered walls. I could not remember the
street I left behind. Diners hastily swept by, some struggling to
remove their coats as they rushed the captain's stand. They were
late. It used to be that most people arrived at a restaurant before
their reservation and sat down in the bar for a glass of wine or a
cocktail. Friends met there, not at the table. But now, this hardly
happens at all. Restaurant designers are constructing more
beautiful and inviting bars. But if people stop to have a drink, it
is either a fluke of good traffic that they were early, or more
likely, that the host has placed them there in a holding pattern
while their table is being set. By Amanda Hesser.

   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The death of Betsy Lehman, a Boston Globe health
reporter who in 1994 received a massive drug overdose during
chemotherapy, was unusual only because it made national headlines.
</P>
<P>
   Experts estimate that up to 98,000 Americans die each year from
hospital medical errors, many of them preventable mistakes. That
number is higher than the toll from motor vehicle accidents, breast
cancer or AIDS, three causes of death that receive far more public
attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that many people got killed on the highway or the
workplace, people would be demanding something be done,'' said
Blair Horner of the New York Public Interest Research Group, a
nonprofit consumer advocacy organization.
</P>
<P>
   But, as a recent study by the Institute of Medicine in
Washington shows, little progress has been made in reducing the
number of preventable medical errors.
</P>
<P>
   Although no one is telling Americans to avoid their doctors or
hospitals when they need care, experts are advising people to take
heed and do their part to help minimize the potential for problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that it's not a 100 percent foolproof system,'' said
Laurie L. Briceland, a professor of pharmacy practice and director
of experiential education at Albany College of Pharmacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to trust, but if something doesn't seem right, you
have to ask questions,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Medication errors, both in and out of the hospital, account for
about 7,000 deaths annually.
</P>
<P>
   In the hospital, controlling for error is more difficult because
patients are usually quite sick and may be unable to speak up for
themselves. Still, Briceland offers the following suggestions to
help minimize the risk:
</P>
<P>
   _ Know your medications, and be able to recognize them by their
shape and color. If you notice something different, ask. Many
drugs, such as blood thinners and thyroid medications, change color
according to their strength, so if you see a pink pill instead of
your usual red, speak up.
</P>
<P>
   _ If you don't know why you are being given a specific
medication, ask.
</P>
<P>
   _ Have a close relative or spouse at your bedside who can keep
tabs on the pills and IV bags, especially if you're too ill to do
so.
</P>
<P>
   Outside of the hospital, the best strategy is keeping a current
list of all your medications. ``They should know the name of each
drug, both its trade name and generic name,'' Briceland said.
Always bring that list with you when you visit your health care
provider, to minimize the risk of unwanted drug interactions.
</P>
<P>
   If you have the option, get all your prescriptions filled at the
same pharmacy. That will make it easier for the pharmacist to keep
tabs on any potential problems.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, most hospital visits aren't emergencies, meaning
most people have a chance to prepare for their surgery or
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Given that, there is plenty you can do to minimize the
possibility that you'll be a victim of a medical error, Horner
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing is to know the doctors who are treating you,''
he said. Check out their credentials before the surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers should be investigating their health care as
aggressively as they would be shopping for a new car,'' Horner
said.
</P>
<P>
   Another precaution is to fill out a health care proxy form prior
to admission. With that form, you can designate someone to speak on
your behalf in case you become unable to do so, because of coma,
chronic illness, traumatic injury or brain death. A health care
proxy also allows patients to detail what kind of treatment they
want or don't want under certain circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   As with most of life, the key to a safer and smoother hospital
stay is some advance planning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most consumers don't think about the fact they may need to do
to the hospital until it's too late,'' Horner said.

<P>

</P>
<P>
   The United States Pharmacopeia, an organization that sets
standards for the pharmaceutical industry, recommends the following
steps to prevent a medication error when you fill a prescription:
</P>
<P>
   _ Talk with you doctor about your prescription, including what
drug is being prescribed and in what strength.
</P>
<P>
   _ Make sure you can read the prescription. If you can't read it,
ask for the name of medicine and the dosage to be printed out.
</P>
<P>
   _ Understand what illness the drug is treating and the exact way
you should take the medication.
</P>
<P>
   _ Check the label when you get your prescription. Is it same as
what your practitioner prescribed and is the dosage information
consistent?
</P>
<P>
   _ Ask your pharmacist to explain the drug and how it works,
including possible side effects.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ask your pharmacist for printed information about your
prescription.
</P>
<P>
   _ When you get a refill, make sure it's the same drug. Look for
color, shape, size and dosage.
</P>
<P>
   _ Keep records of your medications, including dosage and
appearance.
</P>
<P>
   _ Purchase a drug information guide or locate a guide on the
Internet. Make sure the resource contains color pictures of the
medications.
</P>
<P>
   _ If you have vision problems, ask for assistance from your
pharmacist.

   NAIPAUL-LETTERS (London) _ V.S. Naipaul has a new book,
``Between Father and Son: Family Letters,'' and, in what may be a
first for an author, he has not read it, and, at least for the
present, he has no intention of reading it. As he explained in a
recent interview here, the reason he is maintaining such a distance
from the book is personal rather than critical. The book is a
collection of letters between Naipaul and his father, Seepersad
Naipaul (with some to his older sister, Kamla, and other family
members). The letters were edited by Naipaul's agent, Gillon R.
Aitken, with his consent but without his participation. ``I don't
ever want to relive those years,'' Naipaul said. ``They were too

   TOMATOES (Undatee great Chilean poet Pablo Neruda called
tomatoes ``the stars of the earth,'' which ``grant us the festival
of ardent color and all-embracing freshness.'' Today, Neapolitan
tomatoes are acknowledged as the best in the world. They have thin
skins, a vibrant red color, dense yet tender flesh and, most
important, an ideal balance between acid and sweetness. The best
variety originally came from a village near Pompeii named San
Marzano sul Sarno. These tomatoes, which gave birth to the Italian
canning industry in the 1800s, are now grown throughout Campania.

   PRE-DINNER-DRINK (New York) _ The other evening I sat in a dim
bar sipping a glass of Champagne and unwinding, taking in the
room's rich reds and lacquered walls. I could not remember the
street I left behind. Diners hastily swept by, some struggling to
remove their coats as they rushed the captain's stand. They were
late. It used to be that most people arrived at a restaurant before
their reservation and sat down in the bar for a glass of wine or a
cocktail. Friends met there, not at the table. But now, this hardly
happens at all. Restaurant designers are constructing more
beautiful and inviting bars. But if people stop to have a drink, it
is either a fluke of good traffic that they were early, or more
likely, that the host has placed them there in a holding pattern
while their table is being set. By Amanda Hesser.

WARM UP WITH SOUP
</HEADLINE>
 4 takes  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
 
By NATALIE HAUGHTON 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now that you're settling into the New Year and getting back to
reality, it's time to get into the comfort-food mode. What better
way than with a steaming bowl of homemade soup?
</P>
<P>
   Warm and fragrant, soups are a welcome addition on a chilly
evening. A hearty soup, by itself or with half a sandwich or small
salad, makes a great supper in a bowl and can become a winter
mainstay. It can get you off the dinner hook in a hurry and without
a lot of effort.
</P>
<P>
   The from-scratch versions in this collection are designed to
turn out a bowl in about half an hour from start to finish. No
complicated, long hours of stove-top cooking required. In fact,
many of these are so fast you can toss them together when you get
home from a busy day at the office or wherever.
</P>
<P>
   It's a myth that rich-flavored, homemade-tasting soups must be
simmered for hours. There are plenty of creations that can be
tossed together pronto.
</P>
<P>
   What makes many of these recipes so appealing is that once you
get the soup started and dump everything in the pot, you can go
about other chores until it's ready.
</P>
<P>
   The secret to quickly and easily producing one-pot meal soup
creations is relying on convenience products such as canned and
frozen vegetables; canned beans; fresh, precut, prepackaged
vegetables; canned beef, chicken and vegetable broths; shredded
cheeses of all kinds; small cuts of pasta such as alphabet; quick
and regular cooked rice; small diced potatoes; and dried and fresh
herbs. Don't be embarrassed to use them you'll be amazed at what
delicious results they yield.
</P>
<P>
   Utilizing meats such as cut-up chicken, ground beef or ground
turkey instead of large cuts or lots of bones also shortens cooking
time and draws the flavor more quickly into the soup liquid. Use
leftover cut-up cooked beef, turkey or chicken and add during the
last several minutes of cooking time to streamline soups. If you're
concerned about sodium, use reduced-sodium canned broths and
vegetables and add plenty of herbs or garlic or black pepper to
season well. For best flavor results, use a large soup kettle or
stockpot with a nonreactive lining.
</P>
<P>
   Remember that unlike some foods, soups are forgiving
</P>
<P>
   a boon for busy cooks. If you don't have a vegetable specified
in a recipe, substitute another. There are lots of frozen
combination vegetable packs that work well and speed preparation
time. (You can evem microwave them for 5 to 6 minutes and add them
to the soup pot near the end of the cooking time to save even more
time.) If you want to make the soup more substantial, toss in some
fresh meat or cheese-stuffed tortellini. Canned cut-up tomatoes
alone or in combination with broth or tomato paste also makes a
terrific soup base.
</P>
<P>
   Taste the soup before serving and adjust the seasonings to your
liking. Store any leftovers in the fridge and reheat in the
microwave or top of the stove for another meal within a few days.
If you end up with too much soup, the leftovers and use
within a couple of months.
</P>
<P>
   Once you get the knack, you can whip up your own combinations. I
often toss together a fast tortellini soup by heating a large can
or two of undrained cut-up tomatoes, and chicken, beef or vegetable
broth to boiling and then add an array of frozen veggies, some
pasta, a few handfuls of diced cooked chicken and plenty of dried
seasonings such as basil or other Italian seasonings. Once heated,
serve topped with grated Parmesan or other shredded cheeses or
cheese-topped bread slices.
</P>
<P>
   Launch your own concoctions with inspirations included here like
Chinese Chicken Soup With Won Ton Noodles, Thai Coconut Soup With
Shrimp and Chicken, English Pub Chicken and Cheddar Soup, Chicken
and Sweet Pepper Soup With Mini-Ravioli, In-a-Hurry Fish Soup,
Hamburger Vegetable Soup, Chili Con Queso Soup, Easy Tomato
Minestrone, Tortilla Soup and more. Before you know it, the soup
will be on. &QL;

<P>
   The United States has found it exceedingly difficult to define
its ``national interest'' in the absence of Soviet power.
</P>
<P>
   That we do not know how to think about what follows the
U.S.-Soviet confrontation is clear from the continued references to
the ``post-Cold War period.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet such periods of transition are very important because they
offer strategic opportunities. During these fluid times, one can
affect the shape of the world to come. The enormity of the moment
is obvious.
</P>
<P>
   The Soviet Union was more than just a traditional global
competitor. It strove to lead a universal socialist alternative to
markets and democracy. The Soviet Union quarantined itself and many
of its often unwitting captives and clients from the rigors of
international capitalism. In the end, it sowed the seeds of its own
destruction, becoming in isolation an economic and technological
dinosaur.
</P>
<P>
   America has emerged as both the principal benefactor of this
revolution and the beneficiary. American values are universal.
Their triumph is most assuredly easier when the international
balance of power favors those who believe in them. But sometimes
that favorable balance of power takes time to achieve, both
internationally and within a country, and in the meantime, it is
simply not possible to ignore and isolate other powerful states.
</P>
<P>
   The Cold War is a good example. Few would deny that the collapse
of the Soviet Union profoundly transformed the picture of democracy
and human rights in eastern and central Europe and the former
Soviet territories. Nothing improved human rights as much as the
collapse of Soviet power.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the Cold War, the United States pursued a policy that
promoted political liberty, using every instrument from the Voice
of America to direct presidential intervention on behalf of
dissidents. But it lost sight neither of the importance of the
geopolitical relationship with Moscow nor of the absolute necessity
of retaining robust American military power to deter an all-out
military confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, President Reagan's challenge to Soviet power was
both resolute and well timed. It included intense substantive
engagements with Moscow across the entire range of issues captured
in a classic ``four-part agenda'' _ arms control, human rights,
economic issues and regional conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush administration then focused greater attention on
rolling back Soviet power in central and eastern Europe. As the
Soviet Union's might waned, it could no longer defend its interests
and gave up peacefully (thankfully) to the West _ a tremendous
victory for Western power and also for human liberty.
</P>
<P>
   Although the United States is fortunate to count among its
friends several great powers, it is important not to take them for
granted _ so that there is a firm foundation when it comes time to
rely on them.
</P>
<P>
   Today Russia presents a different challenge. It still has many
of the attributes of a great power: a large population, vast
territory and military potential. But its economic weakness and
problems of national identity threaten to overwhelm it.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow is determined to assert itself in the world and often
does so in ways that are at once haphazard and threatening to
American interests. The picture is complicated by Russia's own
internal transition _ one that the United States wants to see
succeed.
</P>
<P>
   The old Soviet system has broken down, and some of the basic
elements of democratic development are in place. People are free to
say what they think, vote for whom they please, and (for the most
part) worship freely. But the democratic fragments are not
institutionalized _ and with the exception of the Communist Party,
political parties are weak.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, in his last months as president, few paid attention
to Boris Yeltsin's decrees. Arguably, the Russian government has
been mired in inaction and stagnation for at least three years.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's economic troubles and its high-level corruption have
been widely discussed. Its economy is not becoming a market but is
mutating into something else. Widespread barter, banks that are not
banks, billions of rubles stashed abroad and in mattresses at home,
and bizarre privatization schemes that have enriched the so-called
reformers give Moscow's economy a medieval tinge.
</P>
<P>
   The problem for U.S. policy is that the Clinton administration's
ongoing embrace of Yeltsin and those who were thought to be
reformers around him quite simply failed. Clearly the United States
was obliged to deal with the head of state, and Yeltsin was
Russia's president.
</P>
<P>
   But U.S. support for democracy and economic reform became
support for Yeltsin. His agenda became the American agenda.
</P>
<P>
   The United States certified that reform was taking place in
Russia where it was not, continuing to disburse money from the
International Monetary Fund in the absence of any evidence of
serious change.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, some curious privatization methods were hailed as economic
liberalization; the looting of the country's assets by powerful
people either went unnoticed or was ignored. The realities in
Russia simply did not accord with the administration's script about
Russian economic reform.
</P>
<P>
   The United States should not be faulted for trying to help. But,
as the Russian reformori Yavlinsky has said, the United
States should have ``told the truth'' about what was happening. Now
we have a dual credibility problem _ with Russians and with
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   There are signs of life in the Russian economy. The financial
crash of August 1998 forced import substitution, and domestic
production has increased as the resilient Russian people have taken
matters into their own hands. Rising oil prices have helped as
well.
</P>
<P>
   But these are short-term fixes. There is no longer a consensus
in America or Europe on what to do next with Russia. Frustrated
expectations and ``Russia fatigue'' are direct consequences of the
``happy talk'' in which the Clinton administration engaged.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's economic future is now in the hands of the Russians.
The country is not without assets, including its natural resources
and an educated population. It is up to Russia to make structural
reforms, particularly concerning the rule of law and the tax codes,
so that investors _ foreign and domestic _ will provide the capital
needed for economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   That opportunity will arise after the March 26 election when
there is a new government. But the cultural changes ultimately
needed to sustain a functioning civil society and a market-based
economy may take a generation.
</P>
<P>
   Western openness to Russia's people, particularly its youth, in
exchange programs and contact with the private sector and
educational opportunities can help that process. It is also
important to engage the leadership of Russia's diverse regions,
where economic and social policies are increasingly pursued
independently of Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, U.S. policy must concentrate on the important
security agenda with Russia.
</P>
<P>
   _ First, it must recognize that American security is threatened
less by Russia's strength than by its weakness and incoherence.
This suggests immediate attention to the safety and security of
Moscow's nuclear forces and stockpile.
</P>
<P>
   The Nunn-Lugar program should be funded fully and pursued
aggressively. (Because American contractors do most of the work,
the risk of the diversion of funds is low.)
</P>
<P>
   _ Second, Washington must begin a comprehensive discussion with
Moscow on the changing nuclear threat. Much has been made by
Russian military officials about their increased reliance on
nuclear weapons in the face of their declining conventional
readiness.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian deterrent is more than adequate against the U.S.
nuclear arsenal, and vice versa. But that fact need no longer be
enshrined in a treaty that is almost 30 years old and is a relic of
a profoundly adversarial relationship between the United States and
the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   The Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty was intended to prevent the
development of national missile defenses in the Cold War security
environment. Today, the principal concerns are nuclear threats from
the Iraqs and North Koreas of the world and the possibility of
unauthorized releases as nuclear weapons spread.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow, in fact, lives closer to those threats than Washington
does. It ought to be possible to engage the Russians in a
discussion of the changed threat environment, their possible
responses, and the relationship of strategic offensive-force
reductions to the deployment of defenses.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Moscow should understand that any possibilities for
sharing technology or information in these areas would depend
heavily on its record _ problematic to date _ on the proliferation
of ballistic-missile and other technologies related to weapons of
mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
   It would be foolish in the extreme to share defenses with Moscow
if it either leaks or deliberately transfers weapons technologies
to the very states against which America is defending.
</P>
<P>
   _ Finally, the United States needs to recognize that Russia is a
great power, and that we will always have interests that conflict
as well as coincide. The war in Chechnya, located in the oil-rich
Caucasus, is particularly dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   As prime minister, Vladimir Putin used the Chechnya war to stir
nationalism at home while fueling his own political fortunes. The
Russian military has been uncharacteristically blunt and vocal in
asserting its duty to defend the integrity of the Russian
Federation _ an unwelcome development in civil-military relations.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Putin is acting president, the long-term effect of the
war on Russia's political culture should not be underestimated.
This war has affected relations between Russia and its neighbors in
the Caucasus, as the Kremlin has been hurling charges of harboring
and abetting Chechen terrorists against states as diverse as Saudi
Arabia, Georgia and Azerbaijan.
</P>
<P>
   The war is a reminder of the vulnerability of the small, new
states around Russia and of America's interest in their
independence. If they can become stronger, they will be less
tempting to Russia. But much depends on the ability of these states
to reform their economies and political systems _ a process, to
date, whose success is mixed at best.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile America can exercise power without arrogance and
pursue its interests without hectoring and bluster. That has been
America's special role in the past, and it should be again as we
enter the new century.

 By JOHN LLOYD  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    For most of this decade, Russia has been consumed by the quest
to become a free, democratic, capitalist state.
 &HT;    Billions of dollars of foreign aid have poured into its reforms.
 &HT;    Bitter struggles have been waged between Russia's free-market
radicals and their Communist or nationalist foes, most
significantly in 1993, when armed struggle broke out between the
parliament and President Boris Yeltsin.
 &HT;    Great privations have been visited on the country in the name of
necessary sacrifice.
 &HT;    Yet, many now ask, what has changed for the better? Russians,
free toch, are poorer. The wealth of their nation has shrunk
_ at least that portion of the wealth enjoyed by the people.
 &HT;    The top 10 percent is reckoned to possess 50 percent of the
state's wealth; the bottom 40 percent, less than 20. Somewhere
between 30 million and 40 million people live below the poverty
line _ defined as about $30 a month.
 &HT;    Russia's gross domestic product has shrunk every year since the
Soviet Union dissolved in 1991, except perhaps one _ 1997 _ when it
grew, at best, by less than 1 percent. Unemployment, officially
nonexistent in Soviet times, is now officially 12 percent and may
really be 25 percent.
 &HT;    Men die, on average, in their late 50s; diseases such as
tuberculosis and diphtheria have reappeared; servicemen suffer
malnutrition; the population shrinks rapidly.
 &HT;    The West's involvement in Russian reform was deep and early.
Even before the reforms began, the big names in Western economics
were debating how they should be managed.
 &HT;    ``There was a debate about institutions and infrastructure back
in 1990,'' says Joseph Stiglitz, the chief economist at the World
Bank, whose earlier work on imperfect information and markets has
put him in line for a Nobel prize. ``I remember talking toference in Prague in 1991 on the theme of 'Quis Custodiet Ipsos
Custodes?' ('Who guards the guards themselves?') in a situation of
rapid privatization. There were already differences between (us
Western reformers) then.''
 &HT;    His major opponents were Jeffrey Sachs, a Harvard economics
professor, and Lawrence Summers, a colleague of Sachs and now the
U.S. Treasury secretary. ``They thought you needed to pursue
privatization rapidly and that infrastructure would follow,''
Stiglitz says. ``It was a divide then.''
 &HT;    But it was Sachs and Summers who seemed to carry the argument.
Sachs was at the height of his reputation. In Warsaw in 1989, he
explained market economics to the Solidarity activists about to be
thrust into power.
 &HT;    That December, the first Polish post-Communist government was
quailing before price liberalization. Late at night in the office
of the finance minister, Sachs had got on the phone and harangued
American officials until they promised to nudge the IMF into
providing $1 billion in support for the Polish currency.
 &HT;    His myth as the economic liberator was born, and with it a
mechanism known as ``shock therapy.'' This was shorthand for a raft
of measures _ price liberalization, budget stabilization, a
slashing of subsidies _ undertaken more or less simultaneously to
``shock'' the economy into a therapeutic, market-driven recovery.
 &HT;    The young reformers in Russia heard about it, and saw in Sachs
and his mechanism their way forward.
 &HT;    When Bill Clinton came to the presidency in early 1993, Summers
was appointed under-secretary of the Treasury for international
affairs. The official who covered the former Soviet Union and
Eastern Europe was David Lipton, who had worked closely with Sachs
on Polish and Russian reform.
 &HT;    On a leave of absence from Harvard, Sachs installed himself and
his team in the Russian Finance Ministry _ where he spent a large
part of one morning chiseling away a portrait of Lenin that had
been embedded in the plaster of a colleague's office wall.
 &HT;    Both men proselytized for shock therapy _ Sachs, vocally and
impatiently, while Summers, behind the scenes, nagged and pushed
the IMF and the World Bank to lend, lend, lend.
 &HT;    The money, tens and tens of billions of dollars, would be used
for the essential first step in the reform, making the ruble
convertible on world markets. Only with a hard currency, they
believed, would investors commit the substantial sums needed to
transform the Russian economy.
 &HT;    That never happened. Yegor Gaidar, the free-market economic
reformer, who in 1991 was director of a small academic institution,
soon came to Russia's government as acting prime minister. But he
needed much more help than the Clinton administration _ or any
other Western government _ was willing to give him.
 &HT;    Russia never did adopt the full menu of shock therapy. But its
release of prices and the soaring of inflation, with the effect of
wiping out the average person's modest savings, was shock enough _
without, as Strobe Talbott, the U.S. deputy secretary of state, was
to observe later, any therapy.
 &HT;    The shock was such that by April 1992 the slender parliamentary
majority the government commanded for its measures evaporated.
 &HT;    With that, economist Gaidar and Yeltsin began what has
characterized Russian reform right up till now _ a guerrilla
struggle with a hostile, often violently hostile, legislature.
Russia's free-market reformers hoped the West would back them as
soon as they took office. But the West did not. This, for many
insiders, was and remains the key mistake.
 &HT;    Sachs ran himself ragged, zipping between Moscow, Cambridge and
Washington, begging and demanding a big loan to stabilize the
economy and give reform a chance. In retrospect, it was a fool's
errand.
 &HT;    ``The international financial agencies did what they could with
the problem,'' says Stanley Fischer of the IMF, who is now its
first deputy managing director. ``But there was very little money
to do it with. We were trying to put a vast effort in with amounts
of money that were, in relation to other problems, small. After six
years we've seen maybe $18 billion go in (to Russia). When South
Korea ran into difficulties recently, it got $20 billion in six
months. ... The problem was the financial scale.''
 &HT;    Thus, the economic radicals, East and West, charge that we lost
Russia. They blame the Western governments' lack of vision _ Sachs
loudly and bitterly, others still in government more mildly and
often unattributably.
 &HT;    In Moscow, Gaidar has no doubt _ the West blew it. ``There was a
massive failure of imagination on the part of the West,'' he says.
``There was no one statesman then in power who could grasp the
enormity of the events happening here.''
 &HT;    Says Sachs, who resigned as an adviser to the Russian government
in 1994: ``I think in this debate the people with the power and the
money, the governments of the West, must take the responsibility.
It was going to be a major concerted effort to do anything, by the
Russians and the West. I understood the challenge, I think, better
than anybody. I never thought that the markets would do it by
themselves _ never. ... The dereliction of responsibility was
massive. It does make you wonder. Were there people in the
administration who wanted Russia to fail, to be weak?''
 &HT;    Summers, who more than any other single official was in charge
of the Clinton economic policy on Russia, would not be interviewed
for this article.
 &HT;    But Lipton, who worked closely with Summers and has now left the
government, says that ``in '91-'92, it was (President George)
Bush's last year. There surely was a failure to embrace the process
of reform. I would agree that more could have been done. I think
that people lacked the vision to see the consequences of the end of
the Cold War.
 &HT;    ``The Bush administration didn't grasp it. But it wasn't going
to be a sure thing, whatever we did. The key thing was the Russians
themselves _ the lack of people who knew what to do, the absence of
a consensus on a Russian national identity.''
 &HT;    Throughout these years, the Russians perceived the West as
supporting what to most of them seemed a government of criminality
and inefficiency. After Yeltsin won the '93 battle with parliament
by bringing in the tanks, Talbott _ the political counterpart on
Russia policy to Summers in Treasury _ sent a message of
congratulations that is still interpreted by the opposition as
glorying in the blood of those who died as the parliament building
was shelled.
 &HT;    Much later than the radicals had hoped, the IMF and the World
Bank began substantial lending. So long as Yeltsin was president
and a few reformers remained in government, the official view in
the West was that reform was on track and our money was keeping it
so. The officials knew what was happening, but the West was locked
into a desperate struggle to preserve reform and to keep the
Communists out of power. They would not give up as long as ``our
guys'' had a chance.
 &HT;    Now, in the West, the critics say we have lost Russia _ through
our own actions and mistakes. Lost because we pursued agendas that
were hopelessly wrong for Russia, and lost because we encouraged
and supported precisely those men in the government dacha, who were
hopelessly wrong for Russia.
 &HT;    The most dismal ``proof'' that Russia is lost is that Russians
now proclaim that they wish to be lost to us.
 &HT;    In a recent interview, Talbott said that withdrawing from
Russian domestic policies, as some now recommend, would be to ``put
Russia in a corner with a dunce's cap on its head and ignore it,
which is not an option for any administration. ...
 &HT;    ``Our policy toward Russia must be that of a lighthouse,''
Talbott said, ``because Russia is going through a very rough sea.
... Nothing that has happened over the last seven years makes me
think they have reversed course or are about to be submerged in a
red-brown tide of fascism. This is decades long. The judgment of
history on any question is not yet.''
 &HT;    But politics do not wait on history's judgment. Russia's 20th
century has been unimaginable in its horror, uniquely awful for any
major country in modern times. It has suffered from our mistakes
and preconceptions but _ barring catastrophe _ ultimately will make
its own accommodation.
 &HT;    Russia never was ours to lose. It must find itself; until then,
we can do little more than watch, offering an occasional bit of
encouragement from the sidelines.

 By JOHN LLOYD  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    For most of this decade, Russia has been consumed by the quest
to become a free, democratic, capitalist state.
 &HT;    Billions of dollars of foreign aid have poured into its reforms.
 &HT;    Bitter struggles have been waged between Russia's free-market
radicals and their Communist or nationalist foes, most
significantly in 1993, when armed struggle broke out between the
parliament and President Boris Yeltsin.
 &HT;    Great privations have been visited on the country in the name of
necessary sacrifice.
 &HT;    Yet, many now ask, what has changed for the better? Russians,
free to get rich, are poorer. The wealth of their nation has shrunk
_ at least that portion of the wealth enjoyed by the people.
 &HT;    The top 10 percent is reckoned to possess 50 percent of the
state's wealth; the bottom 40 percent, less than 20. Somewhere
between 30 million and 40 million people live below the poverty
line _ defined as about $30 a month.
 &HT;    Russia's gross domestic product has shrunk every year since the
Soviet Union dissolved in 1991, except perhaps one _ 1997 _ when it
grew, at best, by less than 1 percent. Unemployment, officially
nonexistent in Soviet times, is now officially 12 percent and may
really be 25 percent.
 &HT;    Men die, on average, in their late 50s; diseases such as
tuberculosis and diphtheria have reappeared; servicemen suffer
malnutrition; the population shrinks rapidly.

 &HT;    FISCALLY HEALTHY STATES SAVE MONEY, CUT TAXES
 &HT;    240&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A booming economy has state governments cutting
more taxes while keeping a healthy surplus, according to a report
released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The report by the National Governors' Association and the
National Association of State Budget Officers notes that states
have slashed taxes and fees by $5.2 billion this year and $27.3
billion over the past six years.
</P>
<P>
   The hefty tax breaks are being financed by a decline in state
surpluses. Projected year-end balances this year are expected to be
5.6 percent of expenditures. That's a drop from 7.6 percent last
year and 9.2 percent two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond C. Scheppach, executive director of the governors'
association, said the current reserve level is about what Wall
Street advisers deem necessary for a healthy bond rating for
states.
</P>
<P>
   The healthy economy has helped states cut taxes while
maintaining adequate savings. Tax collections for 1999 were 2.3
percent higher nationwide than the estimates used in adopting state
budgets. Projections for this year indicate sales tax and personal
income tax collections will be 4.3 percent higher than last year.
</P>
<P>
   States have put much of their spending increases during recent
years into elementary and secondary education, a 7.1 percent
increase over five years. The report did not list specific school
spending for each state.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Despite the rosy fiscal picture, states could face future
problems from at least three different sources.
</P>
<P>
   Health care costs are expected to put more strain on the state
share of Medicaid spending, which increased nearly 5 percent last
year. Congressional Budget Office predictions forecast a 7.5
percent increase in Medicaid spending this year and more in the
next few years.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for the projected jump is the fact that the federal
government is working harder to reduce the cost of the Medicare
health program for the elderly and disabled, shifting some of the
cost to the federal-state Medicaid program.
</P>
<P>
   With Medicaid spending already the second largest component of
state budgets, at about 20 percent, ``this is beginning to be a
concern,'' Scheppach said.
</P>
<P>
   The loss of sales tax revenue from non-taxed Internet sales also
is a concern for states. Scheppach predicted states would see a
continuing decline because of sales by Internet-only companies for
a few years, but then a rebound as those sales increasingly are
made by companies that also have physical locations in states.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, states' fiscal fate will be tied to the overall
economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the economy stays strong ... states will be all right,''
Scheppach said.

HEAD SHOTS NEVER TASTED SO GOOD

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Celebrities _ or would-be celebrities _ eager to keep
their faces before the fickle public have a new medium: the cookie.
</P>
<P>
   Five-inch oval cookies in the shape of John Malkovich's head
recently became a novel _ though questionably appetizing _ way to
promote the film ``Being John Malkovich.'' The cookies were sent to
members of the news media to publicize the movie.
</P>
<P>
   When Polly Mellen retired as an editor at Vogue last fall,
Barneys New York gave her a party and served cookies carrying a
black-and-white photograph of the back of her neatly coifed head.
For the release of Simon Doonan's ``Confessions of a Window
Dresser,'' Barneys ordered cookies showing the book's cover. And
Vanity Fair printed magazine covers on cookies for its Oscar party
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Because cookies are smaller than cakes, it is harder to produce
finely detailed images on them. Yet the Malkovich cookie is so
clear that you can practically make out the pores on his face. And
every bit is edible. He can be deconstructed, sweet bite after
sweet bite.
</P>
<P>
   Most photo cookies are made by baking a butter cookie in the
shape of the photo. The photo is then scanned and printed, using
edible dyes, onto a thin edible paper that is then adhered to the
cookie with icing.
</P>
<P>
   Even in New York City, few bakeries have the technology to make
the cookies. The Cookie Studio in Manhattan, which baked them for
Vanity Fair and Barneys, would not reveal its methods.
</P>
<P>
   Cakes 'n Shapes in Midtown, which bought its photo system from
Cake Top Publishing in Longmont, Colo., makes photo cookies for
anyone, even those who only dream of being a celebrity. But fame is
not cheap. A 4-by-6-inch cookie with no photo is $6; one with a
photo is $10. But you get what no party giver could put a price on
_ something memorable.
</P>
<P>
   People are still talking about the cookie from Ms. Mellen's
party four months ago. In New York, that is a lifetime. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cakes 'n Shapes, 403 West 39th Street, makes cookies from color
or black-and-white photos. Minimum order per photo is four cookies;

FLAVOR BATHS FOR SHRIMP

   Shrimp doesn't need a lot of help to taste great, but much of
its flavor can be lost in the cooking if it dries out and its
juices dissipate. This is almost always a problem when you're
grilling, broiling or deep frying shrimp _ the most popular
methods. But one technique that preserves the shrimp's essence is
cooking it in liquid, and for shrimp there is no liquid like olive
oil.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not talking about sauteing, either. This is about cooking
the shrimp a little more slowly, almost poaching or braising it, in
oil to tease out its liquids. These juices then combine with the
oil to create a powerful sauce that can easily be varied. The sauce
is really the thing here _ most of the shrimp flavor is transferred
to it. So you have to serve it with bread.
</P>
<P>
   My favorite version of the dish is Spanish. It begins with
simmering slices of garlic in the olive oil, which I scent with
cumin and paprika before adding the shrimp. Omit the cumin and
paprika, add lemon, and you have a Roman version that might be
called scampi. An Asian variation is also possible.
</P>
<P>
   With most shrimp dishes, I do the peeling for my family or
guests. In this dish, the shrimp are better left unpeeled because
the shells contain as much flavor as the meat. The cooked shrimp
are a little messier to eat, but also tastier and easier to
prepare.
</P>
<P>
   I recommend using fairly large shrimp, about 15 or 20 to the
pound. Pacific white shrimp are a good choice, and so are gulf
white shrimp from the Gulf of Mexico. The less expensive
farm-raised shrimp from Asia, like black tigers, are not so
flavorful, but will still work nicely.
</P>
<P>
   SHRIMP BRAISED IN OIL
</P>
<P>
   Time: About 20 minutes
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup extra virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   3 or 4 big cloves garlic, peeled and cut into thin slivers
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon cumin, or to taste
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon paprika, or to taste
</P>
<P>
   2 pounds shrimp, of 15 or 20 to a pound
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   \ cup chopped parsley
</P>
<P>
   1. Combine the oil and garlic in a 10- or 12-inch skillet. Turn
the heat to medium, and cook until the garlic begins to sizzle,
then add the cumin and paprika. Stir, raise the heat to
medium-high, and add the shrimp. Season with salt and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   2. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the shrimp are all just
pink, but no more than that: do not evaporate their liquid. Turn
off the heat, add the parsley, and serve with crusty bread.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 servings.
</P>
<P>
   Variations
</P>
<P>
   To make the shrimp Roman style, omit cumin and paprika and
substitute cayenne for black pepper. When the shrimp are cooked,
stir in two or more tablespoons of freshly squeezed lemon juice.
Garnish with parsley, and serve with lemon wedges.
</P>
<P>
   For shrimp with Asian flavors, substitute peanut or vegetable
oil for olive oil and cook one tablespoon of chopped ginger and two
or three dried red chilies (or to taste) along with the garlic.
Omit cumin and paprika. When the shrimp are cooked, stir in one
tablespoon of soy sauce, then garnish with minced scallions or
cilantro and serve with lime wedges.

OUR FAST, FRENZIED, AND FLAWED MODEL OF PARENTHOOD  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LAURA STILLER RIKLEEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  From the start, ours has been the labeled generation. We have
grown up with our own lexicon, beginning as baby boomers, moving on
to become yuppies, with some even becoming members of the
overclass.
</P>
<P>
   Many have also become part of the sandwich generation, caught
between the care of young children and the needs of aging parents.
No label, however, is as encompassing as the one we have most
earned: the hectic generation.
</P>
<P>
   We are the overprogrammed and overscheduled - on the go from our
early morning wake-up to our increasingly later bedtime. Our
choices and our obligations routinely collide, creating a nonstop
marathon of activity. With families far-flung, and with less time
to see friends, our isolation grows. But we continue on, our pace
unfettered.
</P>
<P>
   Ours was the first generation truly able to engage in family
planning, so we postpone child rearing until the time is right,
certain that fertility will follow. Pregnancy has easily taken its
place in our lifestyle. Neither morning sickness nor due dates
interrupt ambitious schedules. Parents-to-be add childbirth classes
to their packed lives, and enter the hospital in the nick of time,
aided and abetted by a health care system that cuts the hospital
stay soon after it cuts the cord.
</P>
<P>
   But what happens after these planned and wanted children are
born? Where do they fit into their parents marathon?
</P>
<P>
   Our chosen way of life is profoundly affecting future
generations by creating a flawed model of parenting, one that -
whether we slow down enough to realize it, or not - is
shortchanging children. Our harried schedule leaves little time to
learn how to do the hardest job of all - raising children. It is
not enough to love our children if we lack the time to share their
lives, set proper standards, and provide effective and consistent
discipline, not through surrogates, but directly, as parents.
</P>
<P>
   Our children's paradox is that they are both enriched by the
increasingly specialized material pleasures showered upon them, and
impoverished by these riches, which too often take the place of, or
distract from, engagement with their parents.
</P>
<P>
   It is not serendipitous that billions are spent each year in
this country on video games, and that the average American child
will spend more hours in front of a television than in a classroom.
Harried parents are desperate for the reprieve that these nonhuman
babysitters provide. If the children are happily engaged, Mom and
Dad can try to catch up with their ever growing to do list.
</P>
<P>
   Our generation created the term quality time to feel better
about this conundrum. Somehow, the limited daily contact is OK, we
tell ourselves, if those precious minutes spent together are truly
child-centered.
</P>
<P>
   A busy parent once explained that, in order to spend as much
time as possible with the children on the weekend, it was necessary
to remain at work past their bedtimes most weeknights. The parent
was confident the children understood this necessary trade-off and
the family worked its lifestyle around it. Another parent - who
does not work outside the home - noted that the daily marathon of
obligations, carpool schedules, and household tasks leaves her too
tired to cope effectively with her children at the time of day when
they are most needy. Other examples abound of overscheduled parents
working out their compromises, and expecting their children to
understand.
</P>
<P>
   But what do children really understand? How do they feel about
living with the frantic pace their parents set? The answer will
come not through words, but through their behavior - in how they
accept discipline, in how they relate to peers and teachers, and,
most significantly, in how they view the world and their own place
in it. A child's feelings are easily accessible, but only if we
take time to tune in.
</P>
<P>
   A friend who worked as a nanny recounts with sadness some of the
family dynamics she has experienced. In one family, the parents
left for work before their children awoke and often returned after
the children s bedtime. On weekends, the parents would hire another
daytime baby sitter so they could go to work, or play tennis
together. As parents, they were oblivious to their children s
hunger for time and attention from mom and dad.
</P>
<P>
   Other parents dealt with their own lack of time to participate
in their child s school events by scolding the nanny for failing to
use her free time to attend in their absence. How frequently do we
hear parents lament that the caretakers of their children are not
sufficiently available?
</P>
<P>
   It is time for our generation to turn off the treadmill, and
slow down enough - at least in front our children - to ensure we
are responding to their needs.
</P>
<P>
   The answer is not, as some commentators suggest, to return to
the days when mothers stayed home raising the children, while
fathers went off to support the family. These stereotypes forced
both parents into roles that took a psychic toll on the generation
they raised, with children yearning to know their fathers better,
and too exposed to their mothers frustrations.
</P>
<P>
   But we use nostalgia for the mythical family structure as a
scapegoat. How convenient to blame the working mother of today for
our family s problems. Our children would not be in crisis if only
Mom were home full time, the argument goes.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, generations of politicians before us deified their
working class roots and, inevitably, their sainted mothers who
worked two jobs so that their children could be educated. Somehow,
those working mothers bore no stigma, presumably because their
motives for working were grounded in sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
   Yet motives should have no relevance here. The quality of one's
mothering - or fathering - does not depend upon whether one works
by choice or by necessity. Choosing to be at home full time is not
synonymous with being a good parent, just as working is not
synonymous with being a bad one. The difficulty lies in the pace at
which baby boomers - and the generation that follows - try to do
both.
</P>
<P>
   As a generation, boomers are used to exercising leadership, and
tackling tough problems. As teenagers, we led the nation to
recognize the futility of an unjust war. As young adults, we helped
revolutionize the computer industry. Our generation should now be
able to develop a blueprint for our times that ensures that we, and
the generations that follow, refocus on the needs of our children.
</P>
<P>
   We can only accomplish this, however, if we are willing to set
new rules redefining our roles as parents, both in the home and in
the workplace. These rules must be inviolate. They cannot be
ignored when it is inconvenient, or abandoned when we are too busy
or tired.
</P>
<P>
   Our first rule should be: Once we have a child, the child
becomes our top priority. This means that, in a conflict between
their needs and ours, we must choose theirs whenever we can. When
our jobs allow flexibility, we should not be afraid to take
advantage of it to attend special school activities, sports events,
or chaperone school trips, even if it means missing an important
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   A hard-driving parent once commented that if a school event had
to be missed for an important meeting, the child would survive just
fine. But survival is not the goal of successful parenting. Our
goal should be to raise self-confident, happy children with a
positive outlook on life. And we accomplish this best if our
actions, not our words, convey that their needs are our top
priority. In fact, it is the meeting that would survive the parent
s absence far more successfully.
</P>
<P>
   Our second rule should be: Allow our children a voice in
defining what is important to them. Frequently, it is the most
ordinary of events, the seemingly inconsequential interaction, that
creates the lasting impression. A walk in the woods, an impromptu
game of catch, or an extended conversation at bedtime can be of
crucial importance.
</P>
<P>
   Our third rule should be: Make place in the working world to
address our parenting needs. To accomplish this, we must become
activists at the office. If we are not vocal about our needs as
parents at work, we cannot expect the workplace to accommodate
those needs.
</P>
<P>
   Studies abound that demonstrate the increased productivity in
offices that accommodate family obligations. Yet the workplace is
replete with managers who are oblivious to the stress a parent
feels from office policies that prohibit good parenting. Widespread
change, however, will only come if we advocate vigorously. No
parent should be forced to choose between job security and being at
home with a sick child. At the same time, no parent with a choice
should leave a sick child to go to work - especially since studies
show that sick children get well faster when parents stay with
them.
</P>
<P>
   But we must be careful about the workplace policies we accept.
For example, one highly touted but woefully misguided development
is the establishment of on-site child care for sick children, or
weekend child care that assists parents who want to catch up at the
office. These are not innovative policies to assist families, but
so-called benefits that in fact further erode our obligations to
our children, depriving them of their parents when they most expect
and need them.
</P>
<P>
   Advocating change in the workplace is a responsibility that
belongs to both parents. Change will come more quickly when fathers
become aggressive advocates for the development of family-friendly
policies at work.
</P>
<P>
   Fourth, we should recognize that proper discipline - although
hard work - is one of the most compelling ways we have of teaching
appropriate behavior to our children. Whether it is taking
something harmful or unsafe away, or intervening among squabbling
siblings, most discipline requires energy and action.
</P>
<P>
   As a generation, one of the last vestiges of the rebellious
1960s is that we seem to abhor disciplining our children and
teaching manners. Yet our willingness to stop negative or impolite
behavior is crucial to reinforcing the critical link between
respect for others and self-respect.
</P>
<P>
   The fifth rule emerges from the fourth: We should take a more
activist role in instilling values in our children. Outside
influences are playing a critical role in their moral development.
Without an investment of our own time and patience, and a
commitment to shaping their value system, our children s peers and,
even worse, their television sets, become their primary role
models. How many of us know what shows our children watch on or
what they are doing on the Internet? How many of us limit access to
both?
</P>
<P>
   These five rules are merely a starting place for all of us
struggling to balance our multiple roles and responsibilities. The
demands placed upon our generation, and which show no signs of
abating for the generations that follow, require that we take
greater control of our buffeted lives, and redefine our
relationships with our children.
</P>
<P>
   If labels have historically defined us as a generation, then let
us choose our own label as a legacy for our children: the parenting
generation.

WINE TALK: FOR CHARDONNAY, IT'S LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By FRANK J. PRIAL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   From time to time, I'm asked to give tastings for groups of
people who don't necessarily know much about wine. Normally, I like
to use 12 wines, 6 reds and 6 whites, all from different parts of
the world. Each red wine will be made from a different grape:
syrah, cabernet sauvignon, pinot noir and others. But the white
wines will all be chardonnays: one from the United States, one from
France, possibly one from Italy, and the rest, perhaps, from South
Africa, Israel and Australia.
</P>
<P>
   With the chardonnays, I try to show how important soil, weather,
viticulture and winemaking skills are in determining what a wine is
really like.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes I tell a story _ a true one, actually _ about an
incident in Paris a few years back. One warm summer afternoon, I
was sitting in an almost empty bistro listening to the owner
describe a favorite wine. ``I'll get a bottle,'' he said,
disappearing through a trapdoor behind the bar and leaving me alone
in the place.
</P>
<P>
   A young couple, Americans, came in hesitantly and studied the
elaborate chalkboard, which listed some 30 wines sold by the glass.
Concentrating on the whites, they read out the names: Macon blanc,
Meursault, Chablis, Puligny-Montrachet, Pouilly-Fuisse,
Corton-Charlemagne, Mercurey blanc and so on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't they have any chardonnay?'' the woman wondered aloud.
</P>
<P>
   ``Madame,'' replied the patron, who had climbed back out of the
cellar, ``they are all chardonnays.''
</P>
<P>
   My point is that calling for a glass of wine by its grape name,
sophisticated though it may seem to be, is no longer sufficient, if
in fact it ever was. Chardonnay is actually a rather neutral grape;
the wine it provides depends largely on who makes it and where it
is made. A chardonnay from New Zealand does not taste like a
chardonnay from the Napa Valley, which may not taste like one from
Stellenbosch in South Africa or like one from the Sonoma Valley,
just over the ridge.
</P>
<P>
   As Jancis Robinson writes in Guide to Wine Grapes (Oxford,
1996), ``At its best, chardonnay, like pinot noir, is merely a
vehicle for the character of the vineyard in which it is grown.''
</P>
<P>
   Good chardonnays are made on New York's Long Island and in
Orvieto, just north of Rome. They turn up in Argentina and
Virginia, in Spain and Australia and on the Golan Heights. And they
are all very different wines.
</P>
<P>
   Much has been made in recent years of the so-called ABC group,
white wine fans who demand Anything But Chardonnay. For the most
part, they are rebelling against the traditional California or
California-style chardonnay, a big, robust wine with too much of
everything: too much alcohol, too much extract, or flavor
components, too much body, and, above all, too much oak. Often the
wine has an added touch of sweetness, supposedly to make it more
palatable to drinkers only recently graduated from Coke and Pepsi.
</P>
<P>
   Chardonnay is the most popular grape variety in the United
States, and most of it is made in this so-called California style.
So popular is chardonnay that Burgundian winemakers, who have been
using it for several hundred years for all their white wines, have
recently been putting the grape name on their bottles to let
American wine drinkers know it's their grape of choice, too.
</P>
<P>
   The dominant taste _ and smell _ in most inexpensive California
chardonnays is oak. Because chardonnay is so neutral, it quickly
picks up oak flavors when it is aged in oak barrels. A touch of oak
can be useful when it blends with the other components of a wine.
But in so many American chardonnays, it can be overwhelming _ even
when the wine has never been aged in oak or any other kind of wood.
In these wines the taste comes from oak extract or from forcing the
wine through oak chips. The result can be a vanilla-like, almost
candied taste that has little to do with good wine.
</P>
<P>
   As a general rule, any American chardonnay with a pronounced oak
taste that sells for less than $10 probably got some or all of its
oaky taste from wood chips or some other kind of flavor
enhancement.
</P>
<P>
   At its best, as typified by the great white burgundies of the
Cote de Beaune _ and a growing number of California examples _
chardonnay is an elegant wine, with fleeting hints of nuts or
apples and melons but never overpowering in taste and capable of
enormous concentration.
</P>
<P>
   For everyday white wine drinking _ and I'm talking about wine
with food _ the whites of the Maconnais region of France are
uniformly excellent and reasonably priced: Macon blanc,
Macon-Lugny, Macon Clesse, St.-Veran and Pouilly-Fuisse are all
wines from the Maconnais and they are all made entirely from
chardonnay. A good Macon or a St.-Veran will cost around $10, a
Pouilly-Fuisse $15.
</P>
<P>
   Chardonnay has been at home in Italy for many years but mostly
in the north. Recently, chardonnays from more central regions have
been coming into their own. Antinori's Cervaro Della Sala ($30) and
Banfi's single-vineyard Fontanelle ($15) are both first quality
chardonnays. From Spain, where chardonnay is still a rarity, Gran
Vina Sol from Torres is a surprisingly elegant wine at a most
reasonable price, around $10. In the same range is a real sleeper,
the Cuvee Allier chardonnay from Vega Sindoa in the rapidly
emerging Navarra region.
</P>
<P>
   In South Africa, the Hamilton Russell vineyards in windswept
Hermanus produce a lean, intense chardonnay ($25) in the best
French tradition. Mulderbosch, in Stellenbosch, now makes a
chardonnay ($25) to match its world-famous sauvignon blanc. New
Zealand wines are made in climates that mirror some of the
northernmost vineyards in the Northern Hemisphere, which accounts
for their flintiness and intensity. Brancott's Ormond chardonnay
($25) is a fine example of what New Zealand winemakers can do. So
is Kumeu River's chardonnay ($35).
</P>
<P>
   In other words, there is more to chardonnay than one might
think. Instead of just saying, ``I'll have a glass of chardonnay,''
it might be worth adding: ``And where is it from?

JAPANESE AND FRENCH TRADITIONS, IN A NATURAL BLEND
</HEADLINE>
  (af)  
 (This is the first of eight columns by Tadashi Ono, the chef at
Sono in Manhattan. They are being written with Mark Bittman.)  
 By TADASHI ONO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Fusion cooking is a term that is thrown around a lot
these days. Most of the time, it means a muddled mix of disparate
influences. But at its best, it is a clear bridge between two very
different culinary philosophies.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese cooking is generally based on the idea of taking the
natural essence of an ingredient _ its sweetness, its richness or
its ocean flavor _ and setting it off with a contrasting taste. For
example, the Japanese way with lobster, which is sweet, is to serve
it with ginger or lemon, both of which are strong and have a kick.
</P>
<P>
   Classic French cooking more often looks at that same ingredient
and tries to enhance it, to increase its sweetness or richness.
That is why the French often serve lobster with butter sauces.
</P>
<P>
   Fusion cooking takes both approaches into account, and since I
was born in Tokyo and did most of my training in classical French
kitchens, it's a natural leap for me. I want to see an ingredient's
basic nature, to know it, so that I don't overwhelm it but instead
make the minimal contribution to show it at its best.
</P>
<P>
   Salmon, for example, is so rich and flavorful that to enhance
those qualities would be overkill. I cut through its richness and
intensify its flavor by curing it lightly with ginger and salt, and
then serve it with a tiny bit of green-tea powder, which is grassy
and tannic and an ideal counterpoint. I also pan-roast the fish,
which keeps its flavor strong and makes its skin really crisp, as a
contrast to the tender flesh.
</P>
<P>
   With the salmon I serve a rice dish that smacks of the sea and
also borrows a little from Italy, not France. It's much like
risotto in both technique and texture, but I take a shortcut,
steaming the rice first so that the final preparation, gradually
adding stock, is quick and easy.
</P>
<P>
   For the Japanese accent, I also make it with different kinds of
seaweed, like kombu, ogo, tosaka, wakame or nori, all of which are
available in Asian and natural food markets. At its most basic,
this is a simple dish of fish and rice, a combination at home in
either Eastern or Western culture. But the Asian touches unify the
flavors and techniques around another theme, the essence of the
ocean. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PAN-ROASTED SALMON FILLET WITH SEAWEED RISOTTO &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time: 1{ hours, plus at least 1 hour for refrigeration &QL;
</P>
<P>
   4 6-ounce salmon fillets, skin on and scaled
</P>
<P>
   4 slivers of ginger, each about 1 inch by \ inch, peeled
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   1 onion, peeled and quartered
</P>
<P>
   1 carrot, peeled and cut into chunks
</P>
<P>
   1 celery stalk, cut into chunks
</P>
<P>
   1 3-inch piece kombu
</P>
<P>
   1 cup short-grain rice
</P>
<P>
   { cup dried seaweed like wakame, ogo or tosaka, or a combination
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon macha (green tea powder)
</P>
<P>
   1 sheet nori
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   4 teaspoons salmon roe, optional
</P>
<P>
   1. Cut a slit in middle of the skin of each salmon fillet and
insert a piece of ginger. Sprinkle skin side of salmon with salt
and pepper, wrap loosely, and refrigerate at least 1 hour,
preferably overnight.
</P>
<P>
   2. Combine onion, carrot and celery in a saucepan with 4 cups of
water. Simmer about 1 hour, then turn off heat and add kombu. Let
sit 10 minutes; drain and reserve 3 cups (add water if necessary).
Keep warm.
</P>
<P>
   3. While stock is simmering, combine rice with 1\ cups water and
a pinch of salt in a small saucepan; bring to a boil, cover and
turn heat to low. Cook 15 minutes, or until water is absorbed.
</P>
<P>
   4. Soak seaweed in cold water to cover for about 10 minutes.
Combine macha and 1 teaspoon salt, and set aside. Preheat oven to
500 degrees. Toast nori briefly in a dry skillet or over an open
flame, just until darkened on both sides, 1 or 2 minutes total;
crumble it and set it aside.
</P>
<P>
   5. Combine rice and about half the stock in a saucepan over
medium-high heat. Cook, stirring, until liquid is absorbed; drain
seaweed, and add it, along with about half the remaining stock;
turn heat to low, and stir occasionally.
</P>
<P>
   6. Put olive oil in a large ovenproof skillet, preferably
nonstick (you may have to use 2 skillets), and turn heat to high.
When oil smokes, add salmon, skin side down. Cook about 30 seconds,
shaking pan to make sure fillets don't stick. Transfer to oven and
roast for 5 minutes, or until fish is medium-rare to medium.
</P>
<P>
   7. Just before serving, stir remaining stock into rice and turn
heat back to high. Cook, stirring, for a minute, until mixture is
creamy and resembles risotto. Stir in crumbled nori. Remove ginger
from salmon skin, and fill slit, if you like, with roe. Serve
salmon with rice, and sprinkle a tiny bit of green tea salt over
all.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 servings.

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: A New Year's baby for the new
century
 &HT;    (Eds: Fixes age to 25 in 9th graf.)
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUFKIN, Texas _ My wife and I stayed home New Year's Eve,
watching on TV the celebrations around the world. By the time we
went to bed, midnight in Texas thereabouts, I was deeply regretful
that we had not gone somewhere and done something extra special _
to New Zealand or to Paris _ as some of our friends had.
</P>
<P>
   That was then. Two hours later, everything changed.
</P>
<P>
   The phone rang, waking me from my deeply regretful sleep. I
fumbled to answer it. My daughter Kate was on the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me speak to Mother,'' she said, evenly.
</P>
<P>
   Something was wrong. I knew that much instantly, and I wanted to
hear it firsthand from her. I always expect the worst, maybe that
the dam broke. I wasn't that far off.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is it?'' I demanded.
</P>
<P>
   ``My water broke,'' she said, evenly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here, talk to your mother,'' I said, and handed off the phone.
</P>
<P>
   It was a heck of a deal. She's our youngest, 25. The baby wasn't
due for three weeks. Her husband, Keith, was in the hospital where
they live, Waco, with pneumonia, hooked up to IVs and oxygen.
</P>
<P>
   She had a touch of pneumonia herself but not so bad that she
needed to be hospitalized. She was staying there with him in the
room. During the night she got to coughing so hard that it got the
baby's attention.
</P>
<P>
   My wife talked quietly to my daughter for a minute or two while
I occupied myself by running around in circles as if one foot were
nailed to the floor. Then she hung up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's go back to sleep,'' she said. ``Nothing's going to
happen for a while. We can get up in the morning and drive over.''
</P>
<P>
   Which was the sensible thing to do. Never mind I was already
halfway dressed. Lucky for me I don't have a willy-nilly wife or
willy-nilly daughters. I'm willy-nilly enough for all of us.
</P>
<P>
   We drove the three hours to Waco the next morning, arriving in
plenty of time. The baby arrived 1 1/2 hours later, William Joseph,
named for the two grandfathers, and born on the afternoon of the
first day of the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The father managed to be on hand as well, garbed in mask and
gown and protective gloves to keep from spreading pneumonia germs,
shuffling to the delivery room accompanied by a rolling IV pole.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody is just fine, thank you.
</P>
<P>
   Keith's mother and grandmother were there, too, just in time.
His mother, all the way from Lubbock in far West Texas, had come
directly after what she described as a hysterical call from him.
He's a boy after my own heart.
</P>
<P>
   They stayed to help with the baby. We came on back home. Next
week it'll be our turn to stay.
</P>
<P>
   By the time we went to bed, early even for us, I was deeply
thankful we had stayed home for New Year's Eve. Whatever the
celebrations worldwide, none could have compared to ours.

SHOPPING A WORLD OF CHEESES 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By SHELLY BELZER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In this new era of the farmer at the Dell, the mouse
definitely takes the cheese. Never has so much information on
cheese _ varied, nutritious and one of life's most delicious
staples _ been nearer to hand, on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   A good place to start is with Steven Jenkins' ``Cheese Lover's
Guide.'' Jenkins, the author of the ``Cheese Primer'' (Workman,
1996), praises small-production American cheeses and tells how much
cheese makes a party, with serving ideas. (Most important: serve it
at room temperature.)
</P>
<P>
   ``For English farmhouse cheeses give me whole-grain or
multigrain breads,'' he writes. ``I like to select wines produced
near to where the cheeses are made'' (a red Rioja with a blue
Cabrales). And ``toasted hazelnuts and black walnuts are great with
all cheeses'' 
(www.epicurious.com/g(underscore)gourmet/g02(underscore)cheese/guide
.html).
</P>
<P>
   For more basic information, CheeseNet
(www.wgx.com/cheesenet/info) has a world cheese index describing
more than 100 cheeses, a glossary of cheese terms and links for
cheese surfers. Cheeses can be found by country at
www.cheese.com/country.asp (also by texture _ soft to hard _ and by
milk: cow's, sheep's or goat's).
</P>
<P>
   Producers of cheeses also have sites worth exploring, like
www.stiltoncheese.com. The site tells how the blue cheese that was
sold in the 18th century at Stilton, a stagecoach stop on the Great
North Road from London to Scotland, took the name of the town. The
Bell Inn, owned by Cooper Thornhill, helped popularize Stilton,
which is made today by only seven dairies.
</P>
<P>
   Closer to home, www.newenglandcheese.com gives access to makers
of good, small-production cheeses in the Northeast, including the
Grafton Village Cheese Co., which makes aged Vermont cheddar. Some
sell by mail order. Three West Coast cheese makers are at
www.taunton.com/fc/admin/cheese.htm. One, Vella Cheese of Sonoma,
Calif., produces Dry Monterey Jack, which, Jenkins describes as
resembling Parmigiano-Reggiano. A four-pound half-wheel is $33,
including airtight surface shipping. (It will keep for 10 days
without refrigeration, summer or winter, the maker says.)
</P>
<P>
   A well-stocked new general cheese store on the Net,
www.igourmet.com, is run by the cheese-importing Chesman family and
is notable for large-production cheeses at reasonable prices. (A
2.2-pound wheel of St.-Benoit Brie is $13.95.) Other French cheeses
include, predictably, Camembert, chevre, Coulommiers, Comte, Pont
L'Eveque and Port Salut.
</P>
<P>
   RochBaron is a surprise, a Brie-like cheese injected with
Roquefort, producing a light, creamy almost-blue ($13.95 for a
1.35-pound mini-wheel, which looks better than its picture).
</P>
<P>
   Among iGourmet's Belgian cheeses are a Passendale _ creamy,
semisoft and subtle, suitable for the cheese-timid _ and Postel, a
firm monastery cheese with enough flavor for nuts and port. There
are two Cheddars in the English choices: a Dorset drum, sharp but
maybe too young and milky, nicely packaged in black wax, and the
more earthy, matured Quicke's. The Stilton is called Cooper
Thornhill after the innkeeper and is made by Millway, one of the
seven licensed Stilton dairies.
</P>
<P>
   Shipping starts at $5.89 a pound anywhere in the country, and
the cheese is insulated in plastic foam sheets and cold packs. The
site also has recipes.
</P>
<P>
   Another site for English cheeses is www.thebritishshoppe.com,
which stocks two cheeses from Neal's Yard Dairy, the celebrated
cheese store in an old London coaching yard near Covent Garden.
These are artisanal cheeses produced in small quantities: Colston
Bassett Stilton (another of the Stilton seven) and Montgomery's raw
cow's milk Cheddar, both $13.99 a pound.
</P>
<P>
   A good site for French cheeses shipped from France is
www.fromages.com, which is offering a ready-made cheese and wine
party, the millennium cheese board, chosen by the chef Joel
Robuchon. It serves six to 10 and consists of fondant de brebis (a
sheep's milk cheese), Ste.-Maure de Touraine (goat's milk),
reblochon (semisoft from Savoy), Beaufort, bleu d'Auvergne and,
from nearby vines, a bottle of Loupiac Sancerre blanc. The price
for American customers, $89, includes express shipping.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The other evening at Danube, I sat in the dim bar,
sipping a glass of champagne and unwinding, taking in the room's
rich reds and lacquered walls. I could not remember the street I
left behind.
</P>
<P>
   Diners hastily swept by, some struggling to remove their coats
as they rushed the captain's stand. They were late.
</P>
<P>
   They will begin soaking up the details of the restaurant, I
thought, about the time their main courses arrive. But they will
never make up for having missed one of the most underappreciated
parts of dining out: the drink before dinner.
</P>
<P>
   It used to be that most people arrived at a restaurant before
their reservation and sat down in the bar for a glass of wine or a
cocktail. Friends met there, not at the table.
</P>
<P>
   But now, this hardly happens at all. Restaurant designers are
constructing more beautiful and inviting bars, tucked into intimate
corners, or dramatically displayed on the way to the dining room.
But if people stop to have a drink, it is either a fluke that they
were early because of good traffic, or more likely, that the host
has placed them there in a holding pattern while their table is
being set.
</P>
<P>
   It is a meaningless loss to those who have never arrived before
their reservation. Those who have partaken, though, understand the
calming effects of this small pause, how it eases the passage from
the stress of the day to the pleasure of an evening.
</P>
<P>
   Many restaurant bars are interesting departures from the design
of the dining rooms. At Danube, the room is like a private chamber
in a palace. The dining room is more of a great hall. The one at
Chanterelle feels like a small living room with art work and
leather sofas , a stark contrast from the staid formality of the
dining room. Eleven Madison Park's bar is like a low, dark cavern
carved into the side of a canyonlike dining area.
</P>
<P>
   When you sit before dinner, you pick up things imperceptible in
the dining room. Waiters pass through, offering commentary to the
bartender of the goings-on. Diners stream by in full view. You have
time to pick up on the mood and the music of the place before the
evening is in full swing. Your mood is likely to be different, too.
You may try a house cocktail or an interesting glass of champagne,
which you probably would have skipped if you'd gone directly to
your table.
</P>
<P>
   People are surprised and then delighted, said Rita Jammet, an
owner of La Caravelle, when she asks if they would like to sit for
a drink before dinner. ``There are a few customers who have their
habits, who ask to go to the bar before sitting,'' she said. ``It's
like ritual.''
</P>
<P>
   The restaurant's bar and all of its seven stools feel more like
a round box-office booth, as if it were fitted for Adalberto
Alonso, the bartender who has been there for 38 years. La Caravelle
was once a speakeasy, so the bar is tucked far in the back of the
restaurant, right next to the entrance to the kitchen, and with a
plain, full view of the dining room. It is the perfect perch for an
observant diner. Plates parade from the kitchen, martinis are
flawlessly mixed one after another by Alonso. Work,
responsibilities, the claustrophobic air of West 55th Street with
its countless awnings are pushed to the back of the mind.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jammet says she thinks having a drink before sitting down to
the table adds dimension to the dining experience. I agree. Diners
today mainly expect dimension from the food, not the experience,
and so they leave asking themselves whether the food was good, not
what they recall about the evening. It could be a fixture on the
wall they admired or the demeanor of a man across the room. But if
the evening goes by in a blurred rush, there is no time to notice
such details.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, the pace has always been slower. If you go to a fine
restaurant, you arrive early and you stay late.
</P>
<P>
   Terrance Brennan, the chef at Picholine, recalled a meal he once
had at Boyer ``Les Crayeres,'' a Michelin three-star restaurant in
Reims, France. Upon arriving, he was led to the bar. ``You sit
down,'' he said, ``and it was just so civilized, and the captain
comes over and takes your order for a drink, and you are served an
amuse-gueule, and then they bring you the menu.''
</P>
<P>
   Could it be that New Yorkers' way of ordering the cabdriver
about which route to take, so they can get to a restaurant five
minutes late instead of 10, then skipping the coat check, so they
can save 15 seconds getting to the table, only to immediately roar
through the meal, is not very civilized?
</P>
<P>
   It's all too easy to be caught in that rush. I have dined at
Lutece without even noticing the tiny bar behind the captain's
stand, and have merely used the quiet bar at Alison on Dominick
Street as a way station while waiting for my table. And there are
plenty of restaurants, like Gramercy Tavern, where trying to get
through the crowd at the bar could unnerve you.
</P>
<P>
   But I will not make a reservation at Daniel without planning a
visit in the lounge beforehand. The champagnes and wines by the
glass are superb. You can sit quietly, observing from the velvet
sofas on the upper level, be a part of the scene in the seats
lining the entranceway to the dining room or perch yourself on a
bar stool and pluck the delicious mix of olives, beans and nuts.
Nor will I miss the bar at Babbo, where the feeling is that of a
neighborhood place, just the spot to drink prosecco and listen to
the waiters give the bartender a hard time.
</P>
<P>
   That night I was at Danube, a group of six sat scattered across
the tall sofa like birds on a wire and in low-seated, high-backed
chairs. They chattered like birds, too. There were drinks on the
table, but they seemed incidental. The group was relaxed and
laughing. The transition from stressful city life to Danube's
imagined world had been made.

 &HT;    WEST BANK LAND TRANSFER DEAL RENEWS ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN PROCESS
 &HT;    With MIDEAST-TALKS-0105.
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (w) Washington categories.
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Israeli and Palestinian negotiators broke two months
of tense deadlock Tuesday by agreeing on the next two transfers of
West Bank land to Palestinian control.
</P>
<P>
   Agreements on the two new Israeli withdrawals renewed momentum
on the faltering peace process, which began with the Oslo accords
in 1993. The movement brings the two sides slightly closer to
meeting a self-imposed, mid-February deadline for a preliminary
deal on all the disputed issues between them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope so. That is what we intended to do and we're exerting
maximum efforts,'' said Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement was also an apparent compromise by the
Palestinians, who some analysts say might feel pressure to not be
overshadowed by the higher-profile talks between Israel and Syria,
currently taking place in Shepherdstown, W.Va.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinian-Israeli peace process is more complicated. While
Syria and Israel have a clear border between them, Palestinians
live in more than 100 small enclaves encircled by
Israeli-controlled land. Israel captured the West Bank in the 1967
Mideast War and is turning it over piece-by-piece to the
Palestinians under the Oslo process.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, the Israeli army Wednesday is expected to
hand over full or partial control of 5 percent of the West Bank.
The transfer includes mostly parcels of vacant land, the majority
being land in the Judean desert.
</P>
<P>
   But the sight of Israeli troops in withdrawal would give
Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat a small victory to
present to his people as they head this weekend into the Muslim Eid
al-Fitr holiday, which ends the day-time fasting of the Ramadan
holy month.
</P>
<P>
   Other land transfers of about 6 percent of the West Bank would
occur Jan. 20, though those areas are yet to be determined.
</P>
<P>
   After both Israeli withdrawals, the Palestinian Authority will
have full or partial control over about 40 percent of the West Bank
_ Israeli and Palestinian sources differed on the total. In the
areas of partial control, the Palestinians dictate the civil laws
but the Israeli Army can still patrol.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's land transfer reportedly includes the same pockets
of land that the Palestinians had refused to accept in November,
snagging the process. But, Palestinians apparently received
assurances that changed their minds in a meeting last month between
Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had reached an understanding. I cannot elaborate on it,''
Erekat said.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians have complained that Israel does not give them a
say in which areas of land are handed over. Some Israeli press
reports stated that Arafat has been assured that he will have a
greater say in just what land he receives in January.

 &HT;    WEST BANK LAND TRANSFER DEAL RENEWS ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN PROCESS
 &HT;    With MIDEAST-TALKS-0105.
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (w) Washington categories.

<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Israeli and Palestinian negotiators broke two months
of tense deadlock Tuesday by agreeing on the next two transfers of
West Bank land to Palestinian control.
</P>
<P>
   Agreements on the two new Israeli withdrawals renewed momentum
on the faltering peace process, which began with the Oslo accords
in 1993. The movement brings the two sides slightly closer to
meeting a self-imposed, mid-February deadline for a preliminary
deal on all the disputed issues between them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope so. That is what we intended to do and we're exerting
maximum efforts,'' said Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement was also an apparent compromise by the
Palestinians, who some analysts say might feel pressure to not be
overshadowed by the higher-profile talks between Israel and Syria,
currently taking place in Shepherdstown, W.Va.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinian-Israeli peace process is more complicated. While
Syria and Israel have a clear border between them, Palestinians
live in more than 100 small enclaves encircled by
Israeli-controlled land. Israel captured the West Bank in the 1967
Mideast War and is turning it over piece-by-piece to the
Palestinians under the Oslo process.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, the Israeli army Wednesday is expected to
hand over full or partial control of 5 percent of the West Bank.
The transfer includes mostly parcels of vacant land, the majority
being land in the Judean desert.
</P>
<P>
   But the sight of Israeli troops in withdrawal would give
Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat a small victory to
present to his people as they head this weekend into the Muslim Eid
al-Fitr holiday, which ends the day-time fasting of the Ramadan
holy month.
</P>
<P>
   Other land transfers of about 6 percent of the West Bank would
occur Jan. 20, though those areas are yet to be determined.
</P>
<P>
   After both Israeli withdrawals, the Palestinian Authority will
have full or partial control over about 40 percent of the West Bank
_ Israeli and Palestinian sources differed on the total. In the
areas of partial control, the Palestinians dictate the civil laws
but the Israeli Army can still patrol.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's land transfer reportedly includes the same pockets
of land that the Palestinians had refused to accept in November,
snagging the process. But, Palestinians apparently received
assurances that changed their minds in a meeting last month between
Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had reached an understanding. I cannot elaborate on it,''
Erekat said.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians have complained that Israel does not give them a
say in which areas of land are handed over. Some Israeli press
reports stated that Arafat has been assured that he will have a
greater say in just what land he receives in January.

<TEXT>
<P>
   In the hierarchy of French red wine regions, the Rhone ranks a
distant third behind Burgundy and Bordeaux. But knowledgeable wine
drinkers everywhere are grateful. While trophy hunters spend huge
sums bagging the top-of-the-line Pauillacs and Chambertins and pay
outrageous prices even for mediocre bottles, the Rhones are for the
most part reasonably priced and available.
</P>
<P>
   The grape-growing region surrounding the Rhone River in southern
France actually breaks into two separate and distinct areas: the
south, where many grape varieties are blended into wines like
Chateauneuf-du-Pape, and the much smaller north, where the syrah
grape rules.
</P>
<P>
   The best of the northern Rhone wines, from appellations like
Hermitage, Cornas and Cote-Rotie, are intense and full bodied and
can age for many years. Secondary appellations, like
Crozes-Hermitage and St.-Joseph, are lighter and more accessible,
and cheaper, too.
</P>
<P>
   St.-Josephs in particular are easy to appreciate with minimal
aging, though the wines can last 10 years or more. Their
accessibility and relative lack of harsh tannins lead some people
to consider St.-Joseph the Beaujolais of the Rhone; yet, the wines
can also convey the complexity of the best northern Rhones, though
without their power.
</P>
<P>
   Young St.-Josephs are inky purple, almost black, with a flavor
that always reminds me of olives. The more complex wines also have
spicy notes of black pepper and sometimes even a smokiness.
Food-matching experts typically recommend drinking syrah with game,
but when was the last time you brought home a grouse? These wines
are just as good with roast chicken, steak, pastas (without tomato
sauce) and even meatloaf.
</P>
<P>
   Like all of the northern Rhone appellations, St.-Joseph is a
tiny area. Most good wine shops don't carry many St.-Josephs, but
they generally have at least one or two.

&HT;     KNOWING YOUR MEDICATION, TREATMENTS CAN REDUCE ERRORS

<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The death of Betsy Lehman, a Boston Globe health
reporter who in 1994 received a massive drug overdose during
chemotherapy, was unusual only because it made national headlines.
</P>
<P>
   Experts estimate that up to 98,000 Americans die each year from
hospital medical errors, many of them preventable mistakes. That
number is higher than the toll from motor vehicle accidents, breast
cancer or AIDS, three causes of death that receive far more public
attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that many people got killed on the highway or the
workplace, people would be demanding something be done,'' said
Blair Horner of the New York Public Interest Research Group, a
nonprofit consumer advocacy organization.
</P>
<P>
   But, as a recent study by the Institute of Medicine in
Washington shows, little progress has been made in reducing the
number of preventable medical errors.
</P>
<P>
   Although no one is telling Americans to avoid their doctors or
hospitals when they need care, experts are advising people to take
heed and do their part to help minimize the potential for problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that it's not a 100 percent foolproof system,'' said
Laurie L. Briceland, a professor of pharmacy practice and director
of experiential education at Albany College of Pharmacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to trust, but if something doesn't seem right, you
have to ask questions,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Medication errors, both in and out of the hospital, account for
about 7,000 deaths annually.
</P>
<P>
   In the hospital, controlling for error is more difficult because
patients are usually quite sick and may be unable to speak up for
themselves. Still, Briceland offers the following suggestions to
help minimize the risk:
</P>
<P>
   _ Know your medications, and be able to recognize them by their
shape and color. If you notice something different, ask. Many
drugs, such as blood thinners and thyroid medications, change color
according to their strength, so if you see a pink pill instead of
your usual red, speak up.
</P>
<P>
   _ If you don't know why you are being given a specific
medication, ask.
</P>
<P>
   _ Have a close relative or spouse at your bedside who can keep
tabs on the pills and IV bags, especially if you're too ill to do
so.
</P>
<P>
   Outside of the hospital, the best strategy is keeping a current
list of all your medications. ``They should know the name of each
drug, both its trade name and generic name,'' Briceland said.
Always bring that list with you when you visit your health care
provider, to minimize the risk of unwanted drug interactions.
</P>
<P>
   If you have the option, get all your prescriptions filled at the
same pharmacy. That will make it easier for the pharmacist to keep
tabs on any potential problems.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, most hospital visits aren't emergencies, meaning
most people have a chance to prepare for their surgery or
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Given that, there is plenty you can do to minimize the
possibility that you'll be a victim of a medical error, Horner
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing is to know the doctors who are treating you,''
he said. Check out their credentials before the surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers should be investigating their health care as
aggressively as they would be shopping for a new car,'' Horner
said.
</P>
<P>
   Another precaution is to fill out a health care proxy form prior
to admission. With that form, you can designate someone to speak on
your behalf in case you become unable to do so, because of coma,
chronic illness, traumatic injury or brain death. A health care
proxy also allows patients to detail what kind of treatment they
want or don't want under certain circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   As with most of life, the key to a safer and smoother hospital
stay is some advance planning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most consumers don't think about the fact they may need to do
to the hospital until it's too late,'' Horner said.

</P>
<P>
   The United States Pharmacopeia, an organization that sets
standards for the pharmaceutical industry, recommends the following
steps to prevent a medication error when you fill a prescription:
</P>
<P>
   _ Talk with you doctor about your prescription, including what
drug is being prescribed and in what strength.
</P>
<P>
   _ Make sure you can read the prescription. If you can't read it,
ask for the name of medicine and the dosage to be printed out.
</P>
<P>
   _ Understand what illness the drug is treating and the exact way
you should take the medication.
</P>
<P>
   _ Check the label when you get your prescription. Is it same as
what your practitioner prescribed and is the dosage information
consistent?
</P>
<P>
   _ Ask your pharmacist to explain the drug and how it works,
including possible side effects.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ask your pharmacist for printed information about your
prescription.
</P>
<P>
   _ When you get a refill, make sure it's the same drug. Look for
color, shape, size and dosage.
</P>
<P>
   _ Keep records of your medications, including dosage and
appearance.
</P>
<P>
   _ Purchase a drug information guide or locate a guide on the
Internet. Make sure the resource contains color pictures of the
medications.
</P>
<P>
   _ If you have vision problems, ask for assistance from your
pharmacist.

   RUSSIA-POLITICS (Moscow) _ The rhetorical question here on
Tuesday, as Russian officials began laboriously assembling the
legal and technical machinery for the nation's second post-Soviet
presidential election, was not how or when the vote would be held.
It was why. With less than 12 weeks remaining until the most likely

backdrop and the November elections ahead, political wrangling over
gun control is emerging as a major issue in many states as
lawmakers gather this week for the start of their 2000 legislative
session. In the wake of killings at Columbine High School and
elsewhere, polls show that a growing number of Americans are
demanding that their state representatives do something, anything,
to reduce gun violence. Last year, state legislatures considered
more than 1,000 gun-related bills, about 50 of which would tighten
controls over access. More than half of the measures were signed
into law, and many that were not are expected to be debated again
this year. By Michael Janofsky.

VILLAGE VOICE IS SOLD TO INVESTOR GROUP
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Tenn., Wash., Calif., Minn. Ohio)   (nk) 
 By FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Village Voice, the 44-year-old alternative newspaper that
became an icon of journalistic iconoclasm, has been sold to a group
of investors who are installing the current publisher, David
Schneiderman, as chief executive of a company that will control a
chain of eight alternative newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, the outlines of which were confirmed by Schneiderman
on Tuesday morning, was completed Tuesday. It came nearly four
months after the company's former owner, Stern Publishing, put the
newspaper up for sale, and three weeks after Stern executives
narrowed the group of buyers from six to one. The price was not
disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   The leading equity partner in the group purchasing the
newspapers is Weiss, Peck &AMP; Greer, a money management firm with
offices in New York and San Francisco. Weiss, Peck recently took an
equity stake in an alternative newspaper in Nashville, Tenn. _ a
newspaper that will now become part of the stable of newspapers run
by a new company, Village Voice Media Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The Voice's metamorphosis from an institution defined by its
opposition to moneyed interests to a prime investment opportunity,
is a sign of both its financial success and the increasing
eagerness of money managers to invest in newspapers _ the younger
the audience and the thicker the classified advertising section,
the better.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview last fall, Robert Broadwater, the managing
director of Veronis, Suhler &AMP; Associates Inc., which handled the
sale for Stern Publishing, said that the average reader of The
Voice is a single, college-educated 31-year-old making $40,000.
</P>
<P>
   Schneiderman said Tuesday that the current editor, Donald H.
Forst, will remain ``as long as he wants to'' and that he envisions
few changes in the journalism of The Voice, which distributes free
copies to about 250,000 readers a week. The Voice will continue to
be distributed at no charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, it's not only a business, it's a calling,''
Schneiderman said. ``I love the fact that you can make money on
journalism.''
</P>
<P>
   His aim for all his alternative weeklies, he said, was to
maintain the irreverent tone that sets them apart from traditional
newspapers, while doing serious journalism. The question, he added,
was ``as we get serious, do we run the risk of morphing into''
traditional newspapers. ``It's something to think about.''
</P>
<P>
   The Voice, which was founded in 1955 by Norman Mailer, Dan Wolf
and Edwin Fancher, became a widely read and influential publication
in the 1960s, at the height of the anti-war era. On the cultural
scene, its coverage helped define Off-Broadway theater. On the
urban scene, it has for years been the bane of slum landlords and
politicians who abandon their commitments.
</P>
<P>
   But when it eliminated its $1 cover price in April of 1996, its
circulation boomed _ more than doubling from 111,298 _ and its
influence waned, as traditional newspapers and magazines along with
new Internet journals, appropriated everything from its trademarked
media coverage to its irreverent attitude.
</P>
<P>
   The other areas in which Village Voice Media's newspapers are
published are Seattle, Los Angeles, Minneapolis, Long Island,
Orange County, Calif., Cleveland and Nashville.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Much chillier air will surge into the Northeast on Wednesday in
the wake of a powerful cold front. Afternoon readings in many
locations will be as much as 25 degrees colder than maximum
temperatures Tuesday. Strong, gusty winds out of the northwest will
make it feel very chilly at times. There will be morning clouds in
northern New England, although in many locations skies will
brighten by later in the afternoon. Farther south, sunny skies will
spread to the shore in the Carolinas and Gulf Coast, although it
will be noticeably cooler.
</P>
<P>
   Low clouds will remain in the mountains of western Pennsylvania
and West Virginia where moisture stays trapped in the lowest levels
of the atmosphere. To the north, clouds will increase through the
southern Great Lakes ahead of a warm front draped over the northern
Mississippi Valley. Light snow will develop ahead of this front in
northern Minnesota and Wisconsin, while an icy mix of precipitation
will be found over the central Missouri Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Ample amounts of moisture in the midlevels of the atmosphere
will lead to partly cloudy skies across the western Plains and
Rocky Mountains. Farther south, high pressure will sprawl across
the western Gulf Coast states, bringing sunshine and relatively
mild readings to the region.
</P>
<P>
   High pressure moving into the Northwest will promote sunny skies
and breezy conditions in much of California. Low clouds and some
patches of fog will persist across portions of Oregon and
Washington. A few snow showers will develop in the northern Rocky
Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Winter Tornadoes
</P>
<P>
   Tornadoes made a rare winter appearance on Monday as close to 10
swept through lower parts of the Mississippi and Ohio Valleys.
Isolated tornadoes are not uncommon in January, but larger
outbreaks are rare. Very warm, moist air near the ground is
important to the growth of the tornadic thunderstorms. Normally,
the strong sun of spring and summer provides a large part of that
thermal energy. In winter, the Gulf of Mexico acts as reservoir of
summer's heat. While the chilling earth eliminates the chance for
tornadoes in other regions, proximity to the Gulf maintains the
threat of twisters.

<P>
   SANT 'AGATA SUI DUE GOLFI, Italy _ The great Chilean poet Pablo
Neruda called tomatoes ``the stars of the earth,'' which ``grant us
the festival of ardent color and all-embracing freshness.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, not all of us. Not us Americans, most of the time. We are
subjected to tomatoes bred for thick skins, picked when half-ripe,
gassed, shipped hither and yon and chilled until they give up the
ghost.
</P>
<P>
   Except for the few precious weeks every summer when backyards
and farmers' markets yield up fat, juicy, vine-ripened fruit,
Americans would have but little way of knowing that the tomato, as
Marcella Hazan has written, is ``one of agricultural man's greatest
triumphs, one of the most glorious products he has ever grown.''
</P>
<P>
   Neapolitans know. For 10 months a year the sun shines bright in
Naples and here on the Sorrento peninsula, which divides the Gulf
of Naples from the Gulf of Salerno. The region's fertile soil,
enriched for centuries by Mount Vesuvius, would make a pogo stick
bear fruit. And Italian geneticists know enough not to monkey with
perfection.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Neapolitan tomatoes are acknowledged as the best in the
world. They have thin skins, a vibrant red color, dense yet tender
flesh and, most important, an ideal balance between acid and
sweetness. They are never as one-dimensionally sugary as a jumbo
home-grown beefsteak in summer and never as tart as a hothouse
tomato in the dreary days of midwinter.
</P>
<P>
   It is almost as hard to imagine Naples without tomato sauce as
salt without pepper. Neapolitans use it on meat, fish, pasta and,
of course, pizza. They make it with basil or oregano, celery or
carrots, garlic or onions, with or without meat. They cook it not
at all, for a few minutes or for hours. But they seldom eat two
consecutive meals without it.
</P>
<P>
   In season, they eat tomatoes raw, notably in the delectable
insalata caprese, invented in the 1950s at the Trattoria da Vicenzo
on the Isle of Capri _ just sliced tomatoes, cow's-milk mozzarella,
basil and a slim filament of olive oil. It quickly conquered the
world.
</P>
<P>
   For seven or eight months a year, the tans make their
sauces with fresh tomatoes. The crop peaks on Ferragosto, the Feast
of the Assumption, on Aug. 15. At the end of the harvest, many cut
down whole plants, with quite a few tomatoes still on them, bundle
them with string and hang them in courtyards, under the eaves, out
of the winter winds. The tomatoes wrinkle a bit but last for weeks,
perfect for cooking.
</P>
<P>
   When those are gone, canned tomatoes come into use, typically
those shaped like little flasks. The best variety originally came
from a village near Pompeii named San Marzano sul Sarno.
</P>
<P>
   These San Marzano tomatoes, which gave birth to the Italian
canning industry in the 1800s, are now grown throughout Campania,
as the region surrounding Naples is known.
</P>
<P>
   No Neapolitan chef or pizza maker or housewife apologizes for
using canned tomatoes when fresh ones are not available. Cookbooks
in a dozen languages specify canned Italian tomatoes, meaning
tomatoes from this region. As Mrs. Hazan and others readily
concede, they are much the tastiest that any cook anywhere will
find in the 4 or 6 or 10 months when local tomatoes are out of
season.
</P>
<P>
   Sunshine in a can, sanity in a can, salvation in a can _ they
provide not only fresh taste but a magical moment of psychological
relief in the long months when the days are shortest and the skies
are dullest.
</P>
<P>
   In October, I mounted a tomato-tasting expedition to these
parts, along with Faith Willinger, the author of ``Red, White and
Green'' (HarperCollins, $25), a gold mine of lore and inside dope
about Italian vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   Because the commercial harvest had ended, we based ourselves at
Don Alfonso 1890, the first restaurant south of Rome ever to win
three stars in the Michelin guide (and one of only three in the
entire country with three stars in the current edition). Alfonso
Iaccarino, the chef, makes extensive use of tomatoes and other
fruits, vegetables and herbs grown in the restaurant's kitchen
garden, which he tends with his wife, Livia.
</P>
<P>
   They call it their farm, but agricultural precipice would be
more accurate. It is located at Punta Campanella, right at the tip
of the peninsula, across the strait called the Bocca Piccola from
Capri.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Iaccarino, chic in high-heeled white boots and zippy blue
trousers, took us there, zigzagging down a cliff face, 500 feet
above the water, in her little Fiat Panda. The road was no wider
than a small-town sidewalk. I tried, with no luck, to concentrate
on the million-dollar view of the island, floating like a gray
iceberg in the azure sea.
</P>
<P>
   There was no fence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you ever visited paradise before?'' she asked me, as the
road narrowed and the wheels crept toward the edge of the cliff. I
wondered how long it would take the medics to find us if she
miscalculated.
</P>
<P>
   But I had to concede that it  &UR; was &LR;  a kind of paradise. Wild
oregano, sage and rosemary grew out of cracks in the rock, the way
they do in Durer engravings. There were eggplants and squash, salad
greens like rocket, and peppers growing on nets; chickens that laid
eggs with yolks that were almost red (the Italians call yolks
``rossi''); and cows for both milk and fertilizer. Small olive
trees lined each terrace, mixed with citrus trees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our citrus are happy, because they spend their lives looking
at Capri,'' Ms. Iaccarino said impishly. ``Makes them taste
better.''
</P>
<P>
   But the 12-acre Azienda Agricola Peracciole, to give the farm
its formal name, is most of all a tomato ranch. Its soil is
exceptionally fertile, and its location traps the sun year-round.
The Iaccarinos and five workers pick tomatoes twice a day from late
spring until mid-January, when Don Alfonso closes for six weeks. In
Sant'Agata, there were fresh tomatoes on the table for Christmas
and New Year feasts.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Iaccarino walked up and down the rows, basket in hand,
plucking tomatoes from the vine only when they looked and felt
perfectly ripe. She chose San Marzanos, which resemble our plum
tomatoes; cherry tomatoes (pomodorini vesuviana) and big pink cuore
di bue (or ox hearts, after their shape) _ all grown by organic
methods, all washed by salt air, which makes it unnecessary to add
much salt in the kitchen, Iaccarino said.
</P>
<P>
   Less than an hour later, we were back at Don Alfonso, seated at
a corner table, ready to eat an impromptu, almost all-tomato lunch.
Before we tucked in, Iaccarino came over and said that the farm was
the secret of the restaurant's success.
</P>
<P>
   ``My fate was to own my father's little hotel,'' he said. ``But
I loved to eat and drink. Livia and I went all over the world,
eating in famous restaurants, and I asked myself what was missing
for us to be like them. I decided that even though we had beautiful
products in southern Italy, we weren't getting the best oil, best
tomatoes and best ingredients.''
</P>
<P>
   Now they are, and Don Alfonso, a pink and green retreat shaded
by plane trees, is full almost every night of the year that it is
open.
</P>
<P>
   We started with a perfect salad: mixed lettuces tasting of the
minerals in the soil, a few home-cured capers, split cherry
tomatoes and the house's own extra virgin olive oil. No vinegar,
because the tomatoes and capers provided enough acid to balance the
oil; no salt. The flavors were robust, yet the dish as a whole gave
a sense of weightlessness.
</P>
<P>
   Then strips of San Marzano tomatoes, seeded but not peeled,
cooked for a minute with some basil and were spooned over
spaghetti. A bit of garlic had been swirled in the pan and then
discarded. Simple. Classic. No cheese was offered, nor did anyone
brandish a pepper mill the size of a ham.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the greatest dish on the face of the earth,'' said Ms.
Willinger, who is not known for her ambiguous gastronomic
judgments. ``It's really nothing but pasta with wilted tomatoes and
a little basil.''
</P>
<P>
   Last, the kitchen sent out another salad, this one composed of
mozzarella made that morning, basil, incredibly aromatic dried wild
oregano, oil from a bottle labeled with a vintage date and sliced
cuore di bue tomatoes _ sweeter than the others, but still balanced
by acid.
</P>
<P>
   What fascinated me was that each type of tomato had its own
individual flavor and texture. I liked them all, the San Marzanosest because their skins were so thin and their flesh soft
without being mushy. Was the flavor so remarkably concentrated
because it was so late in the season?
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   A concluding lemon sorbet of merciful lightness gave us a
reasonable chance of eating a proper dinner. Naturally there were
tomatoes on the dinner menu, too: in a savory jelly served with
lobster, in a tomato and anchovy broth, in a sauce for baby
gnocchi, another for bucatini and a third _ a light but more
lengthily cooked ragu _ for a timbale of rice.
</P>
<P>
   Lest someone feel deprived as the time came for the main course,
there was veal tongue with tomato sauce and pesce di scoglio, or
rockfish. With tomatoes.
</P>
<P>
   Making the year's supply of tomato sauce is the most important
ritual in the Sicilian summer,'' Mary Taylor Simeti writes in ``On
Persephone's Island'' (Vintage Books, $14), ``and each housewife
believes in the efficacy of her method with a fervor equal to that
with which she believes in the efficacy of her favorite saint.''
</P>
<P>
   Exactly the same thing could be said about Campania.
</P>
<P>
   The whole staff at Don Alfonso used to help put up 2,000 glass
jars of tomato sah year; I remember eating some of it, with
a slight sting of chili, ladled over mozzarella and eggplant, when
my wife, Betsey, and I dined there in 1994, before the restaurant
became the toast of Italy. They sell that sauce at the restaurant
and a few other places now, but not in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are plenty of canned Italian tomatoes on the
American market, and everyone from Ms. Hazan to Lorenza de'Medici
endorses their use for sauces when vine-ripened domestic tomatoes
are unavailable. In fact, canned San Marzanos are better for that
than some vine-ripened varieties on the U.S. market.
</P>
<P>
   The best are packed in their own juices. Avoid those combined
with a sauce or a puree, which is often of obviously inferior
quality. Cirio _ pronounced like the cereal _ is one of the oldest
and best names, founded in Turin in 1860. Others to look out for
are La Valle, Tutto Rosso and Asti.
</P>
<P>
   Cirio, which still runs a tomato research station in the
northern suburbs of Naples, followed Italian emigrants wherever
they went, establishing a firm identification between Italy and
tomatoes around the world. In Italy, Cirio is the biggest seller
and commands the highest prices. In the New York area, most of
these brands are available for $2 to $4 for a 28-ounce can.
</P>
<P>
   What's better about the top brands? Well, for one thing, they
are made from the best fruit, processed in many cases within 30
minutes of reaching the factory. No greenish or yellowish tomatoes
need apply, nor any tomato bits and pieces. Little or no citric
acid, a preservative, is added, so the flavor remains pure.
</P>
<P>
   There is a lot to like about canned San Marzanos. Their skins
slip off easily. Just like fresh San Marzanos, they have an ideal
equilibrium between acid and sweetness. And because they have less
juice than most American tomatoes, they cook down more quickly,
preserving more of the fresh, clear, summery tomato taste.
</P>
<P>
   Buy tomatoes in glass, if you come across them; they are not at
all common on the shelves of American shops. And if you buy cans,
buy only a few at a time; the longer the tomatoes are in there, the
tinnier they taste.

BY THE BOOK: FOR DREAMING IN CHOCOLATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: recipes at end of article)  
 (bl)  
 By FLORENCE FABRICANT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The cover of ``Spago Chocolate'' by Mary Bergin and Judy Gethers
(Random House, $35) looks like a gold foil chocolate box, but this
is not just a book for armchair cooks to nibble on. It deserves
full attention in the kitchen, even at the risk of cocoa and butter
smudges on its slick pages.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bergin was the head pastry chef at Spago, Wolfgang Puck's
restaurant in Los Angeles, from 1987 to 1992 and is now the head
pastry chef at Spago Las Vegas. Ms. Gethers has written and tested
the recipes for all the Spago cookbooks. Together, they have
compiled user-friendly recipes that are especially noteworthy in
the cake department. There are also good choices in ice creams,
candies, souffles, tarts, cheesecakes, brownies and sauces.
</P>
<P>
   A few of the desserts are elaborate restaurant-style
constructions involving cake, filling, glaze, carefully piped
decorationsen a dusting of gold leaf. Most, though, are
relatively simple and, if you take the butter out to soften in
advance, easily whipped up to satisfy a craving.
</P>
<P>
   If you forget the butter, there is always a rich, dark chocolate
chiffon cake, made with vegetable oil. A chiffon cake may sound
1950s, but this one is the foundation of a number of thoroughly
modern desserts.
</P>
<P>
   Many recipes do not require ambitious equipment, just good
chocolate. I easily made a moist, bittersweet cake infused with
Grand Marnier without an electric mixer. A handsome marble cake was
another homey winner, though the pan size specified was skimpy. (A
standard 9-by-5 inch pan works better.)
</P>
<P>
   I'll keep this cookbook handy to make shortbread cookies,
chocolate zabaglione and crepes, which can be done in advance and
then filled with mascarpone cream.
</P>
<P>
   The introductory text is mercifully brief, especially as it
contains misinformation, like advising that bittersweet chocolate
can be kept a year on the pantry shelf (even in a cool, dark spot,
it's likely to develop whitish ``bloom''); stating that couverture,
an extra-smooth type of chocolate, is not readily available (all
Valrhona chocolate is couverture); and describing cocoa pods as
smooth and not elongated (they're like ridged footballs).
</P>
<P>
   Those who want an education in chocolate should look elsewhere.
This is a book for those who want to bake with it and devour the
results.
</P>
<P>

Drop chocolate batter over batter in loaf pan, and swirl gently
with metal spatula or knife to marbleize. Bake until cake tester
comes out clean, about 1 hour. Set on rack to cool, then remove
from pan.
</P>
<P>
   5. To make glaze, combine remaining butter and bittersweet
chocolate in small, heavy saucepan over very low heat until not
quite fully melted. Remove from heat, and stir until chocolate is
completely melted. Whisk in corn syrup and brandy. Strain, and set
aside until ready to use.
</P>
<P>
   6. Drizzle glaze over cooled cake, and allow to set about 1 hour
before cutting.

</P>
<P>
   Note: The cake can also be made in a 10-inch bundt pae
batter is doubled. Increase the baking time by 30 minutes. &QL;

TV NOTES: ABC NEWS' Y2K SUCCESS; GAME SHOW GAMESMANSHIP 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BILL CARTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bubbly Success for ABC News
</P>
<P>
   Nobody, not even the technicians in Paris who wired the Eiffel
Tower, spent more time and effort on planning the New Year's Eve
pyrotechnics than ABC News, which committed virtually its entire
resources to making ABC the network of the Year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The gamble paid off in every way for the network, first with 24
hours of coverage that mostly lived up to ABC's expectations, then
with ratings that proved that millennial viewers believed ABC was
the place to be. It triumphed over the other broadcast networks and
even more definitively over the all-news cable channels, which
might have been expected to command attention for such an
all-consuming event.
</P>
<P>
   ABC has yet to receive full national ratings for its full day of
coverage, but ABC's dominance is clear from the ratings in the
biggest cities and from national numbers for the prime-time hours.
In prime time, for example (which doesn't even count the
11-to-midnight hour when the viewing obviously peaked), ABC had a
10.6 rating. That was good for an average of about 11 million
households, which was more than double the reach of any other
broadcast network.
</P>
<P>
   CNN dominated among the all-news networks, but its total of 1.7
million households paled in comparison with the total ABC
attracted. (The Fox News Channel easily beat MSNBC in prime time, a
bit of a coup. NBC pointed out that MSNBC beat Fox News over the
full day of coverage, and it may have been disadvantaged in prime
time because some of its viewers were probably watching Tom Brokaw
and Katie Couric on the NBC broadcast network.)
</P>
<P>
   But cable news took a back seat that day. For this all-day news
event, a broadcast network, one without a cable news channel, was
pre-eminent. ABC executives noted that this was one more indication
that broadcast television retains a significant edge over cable.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, one big difference, acknowledged by broadcast and
cable executives alike, was ABC's commitment to spend millions of
dollars in promotion to get out the message that it was going all
out on New Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
   At ABC and at the competing networks there had been some doubt
about whether the effort was going to be worth all of ABC's pumping
up. Now ABC News executives are calling the coverage a triumph,
adding that they hope it has some carry-over effect on the
network's other news programming.
</P>
<P>
   No executive benefited more than ABC News president David
Westin, who had backed the concept wholeheartedly and was by his
own account ``way out there personally'' in terms of the strategy's
risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had people I respect inside and outside the division
expressing concerns about our level of commitment to this,'' Westin
said. He said he began to feel better when he saw how well the
coverage was going and when he heard from friends that people were
calling to suggest they tune to ABC. But he felt full relief when
the first ratings estimates came in, he said. ``I told people at
the end of the day that we've always been this good, but we'd
forgotten it,'' he said. ``The question for the news division noow we do build on this.''
</P>
<P>
   One way, Westin said, is ``to try to capitalize on that
combination of global impact and live coverage.'' Another way, he
said, is ``to try to find other big news events that can be covered
live.''
</P>
<P>
   Gamesmanship
</P>
<P>
   ABC is exerting another kind of pressure on its competitors with
the return of its mighty game show, ``Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire.'' The show is like a supertanker: wherever ABC decides
to move it, the other networks scramble to get out of the way.
</P>
<P>
   Looking both to recreate the momentum the show had in November,
when it was on for 18 straight nights, and to counter whatever
impact the other networks might have with their added game shows,
ABC decided to bring ``Millionaire'' back with another weeklong
marathon.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of the three-night-a-week schedule that it will adopt
later this month, ``Millionaire'' will return Sunday for a run of
eight straight nights. The Sunday-at-9 edition will become one of
its regular slots, along with Tuesday at 8 and Thursday at 9. Next
week only, ABC will add ``Millionaire'' editions Monday, Wednesday
and Saturday at 8 and Friday at 9.
</P>
<P>
   That move immediately sent NBC scurrying to find cover for its
own new game show, ``Twenty-One.'' NBC had planned to give it a
four-edition tryout on Sunday and Wednesday nights beginning on
Sunday. But with ``Millionaire'' moving in next Wednesday, NBC
decided to move one of the installments of ``Twenty-One'' away from
that date. (Another edition of ``Dateline NBC'' will run in its
place.) NBC will move that installment of ``Twenty-One'' to Jan.
26, a Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Fox, which had been racing with ABC to broadcast a
movie biography of Muhammad Ali, has now postponed its film
indefinitely. ABC has moved up its version of Ali's life to Monday,
the first open Monday night after the end of the current season of
``Monday Night Football.'' That would have required Fox to
broadcast its movie this week to get it on the air first.
</P>
<P>
   With ABC's film now following an edition of ``Millionaire,''
which creates a big lead-in audience, Fox decided that it would be
pointless to present its film anytime near ABC's movie.

 &HT;    Texan rescued on birthday after storm in Alps
 &HT;    By Pamela LeBlanc
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ With wind gusts topping 120 mph and temperatures
sinking to 22 below zero, Matt Sanders knew he couldn't survive for
long on the edge of a Swiss mountain.
</P>
<P>
   But the Round Rock High School graduate astonished rescuers who
plucked him from an Alpine peak last Thursday. During one of the
fiercest storms in Europe's history, Sanders, 23, spent six nights
in a makeshift shelter with little more than a sleeping bag, a
handful of Toblerone chocolate bars and bottled water.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders credits his survival to a bright orange North Face
sleeping bag and a training regimen that included running 40 miles
a week and lifting weights in preparation for Austin's Motorola
Marathon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've learned that life is very precious, that you can always
step across the line, and I've also learned that no matter how
careful or how much you plan, things can still go bad,'' Sanders
said by phone Monday from his hospital room. ``You have to plan for
the unexpected.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors at the Bern, Switzerland, hospital where he is
recuperating say that although he may lose a bit of tissue, the
Texan won't lose so much as a toe to the frostbite that damaged his
feet.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders' week in the bitter elements began when he left a youth
hostel in Zermatt, Switzerland, at 5:30 a.m. on Christmas Eve. He
planned to hike up sledding trails near Breithorn, not far from the
famed Matterhorn, then take a gondola down before the weather
changed. The next day, he would meet his mother and stepfather in
Italy.
</P>
<P>
   By dark, however, he realized he couldn't beat the storm back.
The snow was deeper than he anticipated, and he had to make a
treacherous trip across a glacier. As darkness fell, the wind
picked up. Sanders made camp behind a rock and braced for night on
the mountain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found a nice little area for protection and laid down
there,'' he said. ``I knew there was a potential it would be a long
time.''
</P>
<P>
   An experienced camper and hiker, Sanders had dressed warmly. He
pulled his sleeping bag over his head, trapping body heat as the
wind and snow swirled around him.
</P>
<P>
   Once, he ventured from his shelter, using  ax to try to
move. Wind gusts slammed him to the ground. He had to crawl on all
fours to get back to his cubbyhole behind a rock.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-eight hours after the initial storm struck, his feet were
frostbitten, making it difficult to walk. He could see the lights
of Zermatt about five miles away, but he knew he was facing a time
limit.
</P>
<P>
   When the skies finally cleared, search helicopters headed out.
But for days, the winds prevented them from getting close enough to
the mountain to spot Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, his birthday, Sanders awoke early and watched the
sunrise. The sky was crystal clear, and he could see for miles. He
could see skiers working their way down slopes miles away, but no
one could see him. His feet frozen, he struggled to climb 200
vertical feet to a ridge where he would be more visible to a
passing helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   By that time, searchers had all but given up. Annetta Alms,
Matt's mother, had accepted that her son had died. She asked
rescuers to go out one last time to look for his remains so she
could take them home with her.
</P>
<P>
   On the mountain, Sanders kept telling himself that it was his
birthday and he could have whatever he wanted. All he wanted was a
helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew that was my only hope,'' he said. ``A helicopter would
be the only way I was going down because of the condition of my
feet, and I hadn't eaten in a while.''
</P>
<P>
   By midafternoon, he got his wish.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was sitting there organizing stuff in my pack when it came
straight over the top and just descended almost right on top of
me,'' Sanders said. ``I still jumped up and waved _ I wasn't about
to let them get away.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanders' survival amazed rescue crews.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suddenly, at an elevation of about 3,000 meters in the area of
Trifti Saddle, we saw a red cloth moving,'' said a statement from
Air-Zermatt, which led the rescue effort. ``That which no one
thought possible was true. It really was the missing American.''
</P>
<P>
   After a two-minute ride to a nearby heliport, Sanders was
reunited with his mother, who had gone to fill out paperwork on a
``missing person presumed dead'' when she got word her son was
aliv ``She burst through the door, and of course we all cried,''
Sanders said. ``She latched onto me and wouldn't let go until the
paramedics made sure we got separated and I got a little
treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanders, who was raised Catholic but grew disenchanted with the
church, says the experience has renewed his faith in God.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the ordeal I somehow remembered my Catholic prayers and
I said them over and over again,'' he said. ``I vowed that if I got
out of here, I would return to my faith. I do very much plan on
doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's never caused me a minute's worry in his entire life, but
in this last six days he took 10 years off my life,'' Alms said.
``I never expected to see him alive again, and the Swiss rescue
team didn't expect to see him alive _ they had never seen anyone
survive more than three days in those kind of conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanders, who was born in Springfield, Ill., graduated from Round
Rock High School in May 1995 and attended Southwest Texas State
University in San Marcos for a year before transferring to Stephen
F. Austin State University in Nacogdoches, where he is studying
forestry and wildlife management.
</P>
<P>
   He hopes to return to the United States on Wednesday. Until
then, he's soaking up worldwide media attention. Monday, Sylvia
Lafranchi'haas, the reigning Miss Switzerland, dropped by his
hospital room to whip up a batch of guacamole, chips and salsa for
the Texan.
</P>
<P>
   The celebration has spread across the Atlantic, as well. After
receiving word his son was still alive, Dave Sanders of Round Rock
joined about 50 friends for an impromptu birthday party for Matt
Sanders at La Margarita.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the guests knew Sanders from waterskiing tournaments
around Austin in which he participated.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've pretty much reached the lowest depth you could probably
get to,'' Dave Sanders said. ``Then there's an immediate,
instantaneous shot up to the other extreme.''
</P>
<P>
   He planned to fly to St. Louis later this week to meet his son.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Matt Sanders says he plans to hike again. But next
time, he'll bring a buddy with him.

PEOPLE SAY GOD IS GIVING THEM GOLD DENTAL WORK AT A TEXAS REVIVAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BARRY SHLACHTER 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEATHERFORD, Texas _ Never before had New Life Community Church
seen such revival crowds, night after night, week after week.
</P>
<P>
   Previous revivals lasted a week at best. But church officials
said the one that began Sept. 26 attracted worshippers who filled
the 200-seat sanctuary five nights a week for 10 weeks. The church,
which collected offerings at each service, said 8,000 people from
across North Texas and six states had attended the revival at the
small neighborhood church about 35 miles west of Fort Worth and has
a regular membership of 250.
</P>
<P>
   There was something different about this revival, which is
scheduled to resume Jan. 9.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't the spirited contemporary Christian music or the
rousing sermon. Nor was it the joy and uncontrolled crying when
worshippers were touched or lightly blown upon by a visiting
evangelist or a church elder _ now a common feature of Pentecostal
revivals and known as being ``slain by the spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   What set the Weatherford services apart was the insistence of
dozens of people that gold teeth, crowns, plates, bridges and bands
had materialized in their mouths afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Call it divine dentistry.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Don Connell, pastor of the church, said people have
told him that they found gold crowns on their teeth where less
expensive dental work had been before.
</P>
<P>
   ``The gold part is growing,'' said Jim Freeman, 65, a
Weatherford rancher, pulling back a corner of his lip to reveal a
gilt-colored filling. ``It just happened.''
</P>
<P>
   There were also reports of healing. A church elder said a
shorter leg grew to the length of the other. A woman said her back
pain disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   But gold teeth are the latest revival twist, a phenomenon that
was first reported in Argentina during the 1980s and spread to
Mexico, South Africa, Canada and Britain, according to Canada's
``Christian Week'' newspaper. Now it has hit the U.S. circuit.
</P>
<P>
   Eldin Villafane, 58, a professor at the interdenominational
Gordon Conwell Theological Seminary in Boston and a visiting
professor at Harvard University's School of Divinity, said he
encountered the phenomenon more than 10 years ago at
Spanish-language revivals in the Northeast. The claims fade after
several years and then reappear, Villafane said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard a few cases where there's some confirmation, but
much of it is hearsay,'' Villafane said in a telephone interview.
``This doesn't surprise me. Miraculous claims are part of the whole
Christian lore. The important thing is not whether it is real or
not. What's important is the symbolic value to the people. They see
the hand of God somehow intervening in their daily life.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he cautioned, the gold-tooth phenomenon ``can be
manipulated, exploited to promote a pseudo-faith. At the same time
you can say the same about anything to promote a church.''
</P>
<P>
   Connell said that the popular revival series has had no
significant impact on church membership and that the cash
offerings, split 50-50 with guest evangelist Larry Taylor, barely
cover expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Gold teeth suddenly stopped appearing in the Canadian
coal-mining town of Lethbridge last spring after a religious
broadcaster made it known that he received a ``miraculous'' gold
crown, and thd with hiormed Did thd up t locct e L storol

&HT;     EX-CONVICT SAYS ATHEIST LEADER WANTED TO FLEE IRS

 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ A man federal authorities have linked to the
disappearance of Madalyn Murray O'Hair and two of her adult
children says the atheist leader enlisted one of her former
employees to help them flee the country because of mounting
problems with the Internal Revenue Service.
</P>
<P>
   O'Hair, who gained prominence in the 1960s with her campaigns
against prayer in school, has not been seen since September 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Karr, a Detroit-area handyman and ex-convict who was
indicted last month on federal charges of kidnapping and robbing
the three, said O'Hair enlisted her former office manager, David
Waters, to help her flee because ``they were fed up with all of it,
including their organization and the people in it.''
</P>
<P>
   The O'Hair family was not kidnapped at gunpoint and then
murdered for $500,000 in gold coins as federal authorities allege,
Karr said.
</P>
<P>
   Karr's statement contradicts the government's assertion that the
77-year-old O'Hair, her son Jon Murray and her adopted daughter
Robin Murray O'Hair were kidnapped and held against their will.
</P>
<P>
   The role Karr paints for himself in two statements given to
agents for the FBI and IRS and a Dallas County sheriff's detective
last March is that of a gullible, out-of-touch errand boy rather
than an armed kidnapper.
</P>
<P>
   Karr said he got involved in the getaway plan in the summer of
1995, shortly after being released from prison in Illinois, where
he served more than 20 years on convictions of aggravated
kidnapping and armed robbery.
</P>
<P>
   Karr said he accepted an offer of $7,000 from Waters, whom he
met in an Illinois prison, to ``help guard and run errands'' during
the preparations O'Hair and her children were making to leave the
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``David told me that the O'Hairs had contacted him and gave him
an opportunity to get out from under his probation. David was to
assist them by guarding them while they finalized their business,''
Karr wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Waters, a convicted murderer, was O'Hair's office manager in
Austin until he quit in April 1994. He later pleaded guilty to
stealing $54,400 from various atheist accounts and was given 10
years probation and ordered to make restitution.
</P>
<P>
   According to several employees, O'Hair and her children were
deathly afraid of Waters after learning of his criminal past, and
they would not have cooperated with him except under extraordinary
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   But, according to Karr, rather than being held as prisoners of
Waters, the O'Hair family members spent the last month they are
known to have been alive hanging around with him at hotel in San
Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   ``Madalyn was in the apartment and appeared healthy but was not
very mobile. At times she left the apartment and stood on the
balcony,'' Karr told federal authorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Conversation was small except when it came to religion. The
most talk was over the card table. We stayed at the apartment,
watched television and movies, and also played cards with the
O'Hairs at night,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At times, Karr claims, Robin Murray O'Hair lounged around the
pool with Danny Fry, another man accused in the abduction, while
Jon Murray came and went freely at the complex.
</P>
<P>
   In a sworn affidavit, federal authorities have accused Karr,
Waters and Fry of abducting and murdering the O'Hair family
members.
</P>
<P>
   Their bodies have not been found. Fry's beheaded corpse later
was found near Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Waters, the alleged mastermind of the plot, has not been charged
in connection with the disappearance. He has pleaded guilty
however, to firearms charges and is now serving an eight-year term.
</P>
<P>
   Karr also is charged with firearms violations, but has not been
tried. He is being held in Michigan and awaits trial.
</P>
<P>
   In the two statements he gave federal authorities before his
arrest in March, Karr claims to have played only a minor, distant
role in the alleged get-away plan by O'Hair and Waters, attending
to such mundane chores as renting vehicles and apartments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Karr never says he was an accomplice. He admits to no
criminal activity,'' said Thomas Mills, Karr's lawyer in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``They must have more, or they are exaggerating,'' Mills said of
the federal prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   According to his statement, Karr eventually became fearful of
Waters and consulted with a former U.S. attorney in Florida about
what he thought had happened to the O'Hairs, but was advised to
remain silent.
</P>
<P>
   Karr's federal public defender in Michigan, Richard Helfrick,
said: ``I've confirmed that Karr went to this lawyer in Florida and
had conversations with him about this matter. I don't know the full
substance of those conversations.''
</P>
<P>
   Helfrick, who said he has talked to the Florida lawyer, declined
to name him.
</P>
<P>
   Karr's signed statements fall well short of the admissions the
police said he made last spring when he was interviewed for a full
day at his apartment in Novi, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   In court testimony last spring, Detroit FBI agent Bill O'Leary
testified that Karr admitted to being an accessory to four unsolved
homicides in Texas including one that involved the decapitation of
the victim.
</P>
<P>
   O'Leary also testified that Karr admitted to assisting in the
concealment of the bodies of the victims and to acquiring equipment
``to help the victims to be moved.''
</P>
<P>
   Karr's two written statements do not contain any of these
admissions, nor do they say exactly what became of either Fry or
the O'Hair family, although they make it clear Karr believed all
four were killed by Waters.
</P>
<P>
   ``In October 1995, over the telephone, David told me that the
O'Hairs were no longer alive. He told me that he killed them,'' one
statement reads.
</P>
<P>
   Karr now says, through his attorney, that he was misquoted in
the statement. He now says he told the authorities that Waters only
implied that he had killed O'Hair and her children and did not
admit to the killings.

DRINKING AT BONFIRE AN OLD WORRY AT TEXAS A&AMP;M
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL HANNA 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Texas A&AMP;M University officials had concerns for years about the
school's annual bonfire, but before November's stack collapse that
killed 12 people, the worries had little to do with construction or
safety, according to memorandums and e-mail recently made public by
the school.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, the attention of university officials
appeared to have focused on peripheral issues such as student
drinking and hazing at the site.
</P>
<P>
   For example, concerns were raised in 1997 that residents of one
dorm had brought a stripper to perform at the site where logs were
being cut for the bonfire. A keg of beer and an unconscious student
were found inside a storage shed near the bonfire site in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   A host of questions about hazing were raised in the fall after
the student newspaper, ``The Battalion,'' published photographs
showing students being physically restrained at the bonfire site
while they were smeared with mustard, chocolate syrup and honey.
</P>
<P>
   None of the incidents has any direct correlation to the Nov. 18
tragedy that killed 12 and injured 27, but documents from as far
back as the mid-1980s show that Texas A&AMP;M officials were concerned
about the direction of bonfire activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lack of control of these activities by Bonfire student
leadership in the past has created significant image problems for
bonfire,'' adviser Bill Kibler, now an associate vice president for
student affairs, wrote in September 1987.
</P>
<P>
   ``The frustrating aspect of these activities are that they are
not, for the most part, even remotely related to the task of
building or burning the stacks,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The commission appointed to investigate the bonfire collapse met
Tuesday in College Station.
</P>
<P>
   The panel will not address the side issues related to the
bonfire, but will determine whether there was an overall laxness in
enforcing rules and guidelines set out by the university.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the objective of any project should always be zero
tolerance for accident and injury,'' said Leo Linbeck Jr., chairman
of the bonfire commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're seeking to do is approach this in a systematic way
_ what was expected and what was actually done?''
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission is attempting to
determine where students obtained alcohol at last year's bonfire
because two of the victims, Jerry Don Self, 20, of Arlington and
Jeremy Richard Frampton, 22, of Turlock, Calif., were found to have
blood-alcohol levels of 0.16 and 0.316, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Those results, however, have been questioned by relatives, and a
second test showed lower levels of alcohol. A Brazos County justice
of the peace has ordered additional tests.
</P>
<P>
   TABC investigator Randy Field said there is plenty of evidence
that questions about alcohol and bonfire are valid.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bonfire is a 90-year tradition, and drinking at bonfire is a
90-year tradition,'' Field said. ``I don't see how you can say
there was no problem when they found that keg one year and beer
cans this year at the bonfire site.''
</P>
<P>
   At least one Texas A&AMP;M official expressed concern in the spring
that alcohol-related incidents at residence halls might tarnish the
image of the bonfire tradition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we are dangerously close to having a serious incident
that connects alcohol, residence halls and Bonfire,'' J. Malon
Southerland, vice president for student affairs, wrote in a memo to
colleagues March 9.
</P>
<P>
   An e-mail response from Ron Sasse, director of Texas A&AMP;M's
residence life, to Southerland said changing students' behavior
wouldn't happen overnight.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the effort is to be truly effective, students must perceive
that efforts of the university are true and pure by the elimination
of a `double standard' that many feels exists on campus (i.e.
alcohol is allowed on campus at tents and tailgate parties during
athletic events, alcohol at Kyle Field, etc.),'' Sasse wrote.
</P>
<P>
   A bonfire performance review subcommittee report from March, 4,
1997, shows that alcohol contributed to an unspecified accident
during the previous year's bonfire construction.
</P>
<P>
   An unnamed student ``had consumed alcohol prior to being called
to return to the field to cover an extra shift. And being under the
influence of alcohol was a significant contributing factor to the
accident. He knowingly violated one of the most important safety
policies of Bonfire _ no one under the influence of alcohol is
allowed to work on Bonfire,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time he received the call to return to the field, he
should have informed the caller that he was in no condition to work
on stack. Instead of `letting his friends down,' he chose to
disregard the policy and return to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Linbeck said his commission's staff is seeking consultants to
address behavioral issues related to the construction of bonfire,
and will hire other firms to deal with the safety and construction
issues.
</P>
<P>
   MORE nn
</P>
<P>
   ``We're dealing with questions of safety issues, training
issues, the size of the work force at the site. Our staff is in the
process of making inquiries and identifying what firms may be
qualified to address these questions,'' Linbeck said.
</P>
<P>
   University e-mail communications show that the school had some
anxiety that students displayed a sense of invincibility while
working on the massive project.
</P>
<P>
   ``I agree there is just no room for foolish mistakes or
breakdowns in prescribed safety procedures,'' wrote then-bonfire
adviser Kevin Jackson in a Dec. 2, 1996, e-mail to Southerland.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may very well be the `invincibility' that so many 18- to
22-year-olds (especially Aggies) feel precludes them for fully
understanding this.''
</P>
<P>
   The university has imposed various restrictions on residence
halls in recent years because of various hazing-related violations.
Many dealt with the early morning rousting of students in residence
halls to cut down trees to be used in the bonfire.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most unusual incident was in 1997 when students in
Dunn Hall brought a stripper to the cutting site to perform for
male students.
</P>
<P>
   ``This action was discussed with people within the dorm who
planned on watching and who did not,'' according to an internal
e-mail addressed to Southerland.
</P>
<P>
   ``On Sunday, Dunn Hall smuggled the stripper into the woods as
if she was another female cutting logs with their dorm. The woods
were separated into those who wanted to watch and those that did
not.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1996 Aggie Safety Bonfire Plan requires that freshmen or
first-time workers wear a white band of tape around the right leg
and wear hardhats while inside the perimeter. The plan decrees that
one senior ``redpot,'' two junior ``redpots'' (the leaders in
bonfire's hierarchy) and one bonfire coordinator be present during
all working hours.
</P>
<P>
   Photographs released by the university indicate that many rules
may not have been followed during last year's construction. In the
pictures, students without helmets or safety harnesses can be seen
standing on the log stack.
</P>
<P>
   At Tuesday's meeting, the commission was to announce the hiring
of several engineering firms to look at a variety of issues
involving the design and construction of the bonfire, Linbeck said.
</P>
<P>
   Another study will look at the structure that was built last
year, compared with what was intended to be built, he said.
</P>
<P>
   A report for the commission has already shown that the bonfire
stack was 4 feet higher than the 55-foot limit set by the
university and was still growing. Some students have suggested that
the height limit was ignored almost every year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just going to start at the beginning and go from
there,'' Linbeck said. ``In asking the question of what was
intended to be built this time, it only seems logical to look at a
historical framework. It may or may not have a bearing on the cause
of the collapse, but we will be looking at the historical context
to ... to see if changes throughout the years led to any
failures.''
</P>
<P>
   The commission also wants a committee to pore over police
reports, witness interviews, photographs and videotapes from the
bonfire collapse and compile a report.
</P>
<P>
   Texas A&AMP;M set March 31 as a goal for a final report from the
commission, but Linbeck suggested that the investigation could take
much longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way in the world I can give a well-informed answer
to that question,'' Linbeck said. ``We don't have a budget. We
don't have a schedule. Whether March 31 is a legitimate date or
not, I don't know.''

   KNOWLEDGE-DISCOVERY _ AUSTIN, Texas _ The shopping fervor this
holiday season sealed a critical second phase for online merchants
_ rather than simply luring visitors to the site, companies had to
turn them into repeat customers. To boost the cachet of their
company name, dot-coms poured an estimated $1.6 billion into ad
campaigns in 1999, according to industry tracker Competitive Media
Reporting. That figure doesn't include myriad promotional gimmicks,
like free gifts or shipping. It's a lot of money for an Internet
startup to spend. One software company claims its software can help
e-tailers recoup some of that cash, helping them stretch
advertising and marketing dollars in their quest to turn a profit.
``Eventually, these guys have got to make money,'' said Elaine

</P>
<P>
   TECH-COATING _ The quest for better materials is ancient, but a
young Atlanta-grown company has made materials its high-tech
strength. MicroCoating Technologies, founded in the Georgia Tech
incubator in 1993 by native Atlantan, Andrew T. Hunt, is built on a
thin but sturdy patented coating. The thin coating is used to
construct electronic circuits, and is now being adapted to many
uses as diverse as fuel cells and solar instruments. The company
grew through ``bootstrapping,'' mainly through revenues but has
managed to double in size every year _ and has been profitable from
the start. Grown to this point mostly by partnering with other
companies, MCT is now poised to go more independent through a plan
to go public. (Holsendolph, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

   LASTMINUTE-TRAVEL _ LastMinuteTravel.com's time has come, its
founders believe. The fledgling Atlanta-based Web site, which lists
offers aimed at spur-of-the-moment travelers, has fully activated
its site and launched a marketing campaign. It's even preparing a
Super Bowl TV ad _ usually the province of corporate titans. It
will air during the last minute of the Jan. 30 game. (Thurston,

   TECH-JOB _ There's a flashy McDonald's commercial you may have
seen. Lured by steaming hot french fries, then-Chicago Bulls player
Scottie Pippen ``steps'' out of a poster hanging on a bedroom wall,
changing instantly from the flat photograph into a living,
breathing, french-fry-eating Pippen. It used to be that such
special effects were found only in blockbuster movies. And now, as
retailers and broadcasters compete for consumer attention, CGI
animators like Brett Gardy are transforming commercials into high
tech wonders, blurring the lines between virtual and actual reality
in hopes of piquing viewer interest. Gardy's job is to create the
impossible and make it look real--in 60 seconds or less. (MMallory,

   WALKER-CHANGES _ ATLANTA _ Advocates of change believe a new
securities market is emerging that will be especially good for
individual investors, opening doors once closed to all but Wall
Street insiders, while slashing the cost of trading. The outcome of
this turmoil will decide nothing less than the process by which
investors buy and sell stocks and other securities in the future,
and how the institutions that handle the trading do their jobs.

   PORTFOLIO-DRIPS _ ATLANTA _ Can you build a portfolio of
technology stocks on a shoestring budget? Now you can. Two firms
recently introduced an investment service that permits small
investors to dollar-cost-average their way into the shares of
companies _ such as Microsoft and Cisco Systems _ that don't offer
dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plans. DRIPs, as they are

   2000-MARKET _ ATLANTA _ The stock market is a spindly looking
thing, very tall and very, very thin. The Nasdaq composite gained
85.6 percent in 1999, but just a handful of the thousands of stocks
in that index accounted for most of the rise. Among the stocks in
the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index, there were more losers than
gainers last year. Does that concern money managers and investment

PEOPLE SAY GOD IS GIVING THEM GOLD DENTAL WORK AT A TEXAS REVIVAL
</HEADLINE>

c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEATHERFORD, Texas _ Never before had New Life Community Church
seen such revival crowds, night after night, week after week.
</P>
<P>
   Previous revivals lasted a week at best. But church officials
said the one that began Sept. 26 attracted worshippers who filled
the 200-seat sanctuary five nights a week for 10 weeks. The church,
which collected offerings at each service, said 8,000 people from
across North Texas and six states had attended the revival at the
small neighborhood church about 35 miles west of Fort Worth and has
a regular membership of 250.
</P>
<P>
   There was something different about this revival, which is
scheduled to resume Jan. 9.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't the spirited contemporary Christian music or the
rousing sermon. Nor was it the joy and uncontrolled crying when
worshippers were touched or lightly blown upon by a visiting
evangelist or a church elder _ now a common feature of Pentecostal
revivals and known as being ``slain by the spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   What set the Weatherford services apart was the insistence of
dozens of people that gold teeth, crowns, plates, bridges and bands
had materialized in their mouths afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Call it divine dentistry.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Don Connell, pastor of the church, said people have
told him that they found gold crowns on their teeth where less
expensive dental work had been before.
</P>
<P>
   ``The gold part is growing,'' said Jim Freeman, 65, a
Weatherford rancher, pulling back a corner of his lip to reveal a
gilt-colored filling. ``It just happened.''
</P>
<P>
   There were also reports of healing. A church elder said a
shorter leg grew to the length of the other. A woman said her back
pain disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   But gold teeth are the latest revival twist, a phenomenon that
was first reported in Argentina during the 1980s and spread to
Mexico, South Africa, Canada and Britain, according to Canada's
``Christian Week'' newspaper. Now it has hit the U.S. circuit.
</P>
<P>
   Eldin Villafane, 58, a professor at the interdenominational
Gordon Conwell Theological Seminary in Boston and a visiting
professor at Harvard University's School of Divinity, said he
encountered the phenomenon more than 10 years ago at
Spanish-language revivals in the Northeast. The claims fade after
several years and then reappear, Villafane said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard a few cases where there's some confirmation, but
much of it is hearsay,'' Villafane said in a telephone interview.
``This doesn't surprise me. Miraculous claims are part of the whole
Christian lore. The important thing is not whether it is real or
not. What's important is the symbolic value to the people. They see
the hand of God somehow intervening in their daily life.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he cautioned, the gold-tooth phenomenon ``can be
manipulated, exploited to promote a pseudo-faith. At the same time
you can say the same about anything to promote a church.''
</P>
<P>
   Connell said that the popular revival series has had no
significant impact on church membership and that the cash
offerings, split 50-50 with guest evangelist Larry Taylor, barely
cover expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Gold teeth suddenly stopped appearing in the Canadian
coal-mining town of Lethbridge last spring after a religious
broadcaster made it known that he received a ``miraculous'' gold
crown, and then checked with his dentist.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jack Sherman informed Dick Dewert that he had fitted the
crown 11 years before. Dewert owned up to the fact in a letter to
the local newspaper, but he became the object of public ridicule.
</P>
<P>
   The local newspaper, ``The Lethbridge Herald,'' outlined the
story in gilt and ran the headline, ``Fool of Gold,'' Dewert said
in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was terribly embarrassed. I put my sunglasses on and drove a
different way to my office each day,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A chastened Dewert said he has become more wary of such claims.
But when asked whether he still believes in miracles, he replied,
``Yes, I see them all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   In Weatherford, the talk of gold teeth has become a sensation.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife has perfect teeth, and we wanted her to have a
mouthful (of gold teeth) to prove God's power,'' said Charles Ford,
57, a car salesman who recently moved to Weatherford from San
Angelo in West Texas. ``We prayed for her, but I got the gold tooth
_ totally off the wall. It's weird, wonderful weird.''
</P>
<P>
   After a service, Connell said, some people reported similar gold
crowns only to remember that they had gotten them in a dentist's
chair years earlier. Still, most are the work of God, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're beautiful teeth, absolutely beautiful,'' said Connell,
whose congregation is affiliated with the International Church of
the Four Square Gospel, founded by evangelist Amy Semple McPherson.
``The question is, Why gold teeth? Why not perfect health? We just
feel God is touching and saying, `Have a little gold.' It's a
sign.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying it's pure gold,'' said Mary Carter of
Colleyville, who said she received gold dental work. ``But it sure
does glitter and shine. No one knows what this is all about, and no
one can explain why. But it came from God, from Jesus.''
</P>
<P>
   At some Canadian and U.S. revivals, gold flakes materialized
along with the gold teeth. A geochemist at the University of
Toronto analyzed such a bit and found it to be gold-colored
glitter, made of plastic film.
</P>
<P>
   A gold speck found at a Dallas revival melted when heated, said
Ole Anthony of the Trinity Foundation, a nonprofit organization
that investigates alleged excesses by televangelists.
</P>
<P>
   But there were no general gold dust claims at the Weatherford
revivals, although Carter said she picked up a minute particle on a
piece of tape. Church member Jerry Stanley said there had been
other gold dust sightings.
</P>
<P>
   Dentists remain among the skeptical about the assertions that
crowns have turned to gold in the Parker County seat, famous for
its peach crop and cutting horse ranches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no explanation for what's going on,'' said Dr. Paul
Phillips, 72, who has practiced dentistry in Weatherford for 32
years. ``It just doesn't make any sense. For a tooth to mutate into
gold, that would be alchemy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What's the deal?'' asked Thomas Novak, a Chicago-reared
dentist who has been in Weatherford for three years. ``If he's
going to change it to gold, why doesn't he change it to tooth? I
guess I'm a little bit cynical. I would want to know what kind of
cement God is using to keep that gold in.''

STONE CRABS: THE CLAWS IN DEMAND THIS SEASON 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: recipes and optional sidebar at end of article)  
 (bl)  
 By STEVEN RAICHLEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ At dawn, herons and snowy egrets wade among the
mangroves. Sunlight sparkles on the water; pelicans swoop overhead.
Out on the horizon a string of barrier islands frames Biscayne Bay
like a necklace. In the other direction, the skyline of Miami
glimmers faintly, half an hour and a world away.
</P>
<P>
   Piloting a bargelike, military green boat, Miron Nastaszczuk has
left Black Point Marina south of the city on this luminescent
winter day in search of the crustaceans that are as much a symbol
of south Florida as the sabal palm on the state seal.
</P>
<P>
   A typical day will find him on the water until dusk, braving
mosquitoes, searing sun, spot checks by the marine patrol and the
predations of poachers and sea life. The rewards will be evident on
tables from Miami to Key West and, increasingly, in big cities up
north.
</P>
<P>
   The object of Nastaszczuk's attentions is nothing less than the
stone crab, a delicacy prized only for its appendages. The claws
are a crab aficionado's definf perfection: all meat, tender
but still a little firm, succulent, plump, juicy, briny and sweet.
The meat is darker and richer tasting than that of a blue or
Dungeness crab.
</P>
<P>
   What makes the crabs even more delectable is knowing they are
available only for a few months _ the season runs from mid-October
to mid-May _ and are really at their best close to where they are
caught, on Biscayne Bay, on Florida's Gulf Coast and in the Keys.
</P>
<P>
   Found as far north as North Carolina and as far west as Texas,
stone crabs have a shell as hard as their name, and the claws can
grow to be half a crab's weight, as much as three-quarters of a
pound. Canny crabbers long ago discovered that the claws
regenerate. Unlike blue crabs, which perish for human pleasure,
stone crabs give up only their claws. In 12 to 18 months, they will
grow new ones.
</P>
<P>
   In the last 80 years, stone crabs have gone from trash-fish
status to one of the most lucrative seafoods in Florida. Stone
crabbing has become a $12 million- to $15-million-a-year industry,
employing more than 4,000. This year, the catch has held steady,
but prices have skyrocketed, 25 to 33 percent on the wholesale
level, as demand has grown. Many of New York City's best fish
markets and restaurants say they are having trouble getting steady
supplies, especially of larger claws.
</P>
<P>
   Still, stone crabs are a staple of winter menus all the way down
U.S. 1 to Key West, offered in orders of two enormous claws to
eight medium ones, cold or hot, typically with drawn butter and
mustard sauce.
</P>
<P>
   And on this sparkling day, Miron Nastaszczuk is going to show me
exactly how those precious crab claws get from the deep to the
diner. The object of our pursuit is Menippe mercenaria, an oval
crustacean five inches across from the tips of its carapace, with a
hard brown and black speckled shell, hairy legs with needle-sharp
points and those claws: massive, cream-colored, black-tipped and
meaty, very meaty.
</P>
<P>
   Stone crabs live deep in the mud and are caught in square wooden
traps baited with fish heads and cracked pork bones. Each trap has
a plastic funnel leading into the top and a slab of concrete at the
bottom to keep it submerged. Nastaszczuk (pronounced NAS-ta-shuck),
who has been working on the water here since moving from New York
in 1977, keeps about 600 traps spread out over 25 miles. Every one
has to be emptied by hand.
</P>
<P>
   We motor up to the first buoy, catch it with a gaff and feed the
line into a winch at the rear of the boat. The motor whines as it
pulls the trap onto a metal frame, called a table. And it is empty.
Poachers have beat us to it. (Through the day, we will pull traps
that have been crushed by sharks, eviscerated by sea turtles and
gnawed through by the stone crabs themselves. And then there are
Florida's frequent hurricanes. Nastaszczuk lost half his traps in
Hurricane Irene, which struck the day stone crab season opened in
October, and his boat still awaits costly repairs at the dock.
Today, we are using a loaner.)
</P>
<P>
   Finally, we get lucky. A telltale rattle issues from a trap as
it is hauled from the water. Nastaszczuk, now with rubber yellow
bib overalls over his sweat pants and gloves on his hands, opens
the lid and pulls out a stone crab the size of a box turtle, its
claws and legs flailing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm like a surgeon about to amputate,'' he says. He grabs a
claw with each hand and wrestles the crab to his chest. With a
motion so quick it's hardly perceptible, he snaps off the claws and
tosses them into a bucket of sea water. The crab goes back into the
ocean, where it will grow another set. Called ``retreads,'' these
claws are never quite as big as the old ones, but they're just as
tasty.
</P>
<P>
   The operation is much harder than it looks. Stone crabs are
feisty, and strong. They have only two predators: octopus and man.
Seizing the claws is like arm-wrestling a muscular teen-ager. If
you don't seize the claws just right, you wind up getting pinched.
If you don't snap off the claws just right, you kill the crab.
</P>
<P>
   Experts like Stephen Sawitz, fourth-generation owner of Joe's
Stone Crab in Miami Beach, liken stone crabs to wine grapes, since
every subtle change in the harvest location, microclimate,
temperature and time of year affects their flavor. A dark orange
stone crab claw from northern Florida will be firmer, tougher and
saltier than a cream-colored claw from Chokoloskee at the southwest
tip of the Florida mainland, which is mild, sweet and succulent.
</P>
<P>
   The years have taught Nastaszczuk to set his traps in
nutrient-rich hollows and next to underwater currents, since
``crabs like running water,'' he said. Today's catch gives the full
measure of his skill: 80 percent of the crabs he lands qualify as
jumbo or colossal, with claws weighing at least half a pound each.
</P>
<P>
   He is careful to measure the smaller claws with a plastic gauge
tied to the winch to make sure they conform to the legal minimum of
two and three-quarter inches from the first joint to the tip of the
lower, immovable finger. Every quarter-inch matters: at midmorning,
we're boarded by the marine patrol; an officer approves the size of
our claws, then sends us on our way.
</P>
<P>
   When we return to the marina, Nastaszczuk gives a few choice
claws to his boat mechanic and takes the rest to the Golden Rule
Fish Market on U.S. 1 south of Miami, a neighborhood fish market.
The co-owner, Jeff Mullins, arranges for the claws to be boiled in
giant cauldrons for exactly 15 minutes, then iced down to keep the
meat from adhering to the shell. A stone crab hot out of the pot
has a strong iodine taste and watery flesh; chilling changes the
flavor and firms the flesh.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Joe's Stone Crab, on Biscayne Street at the southern tip of
Miami Beach, is probably the nation's best-known outlet for what
crabbers like Nastaszczuk bring in. A sprawling 425-seat
restaurant, it began in 1913 when a Hungarian-born waiter, Joe
Weiss, moved from New York to Miami and opened a fish shack with
his wife, Jennie: eight tables on the front porch of their
bungalow. Weiss did the cooking, his wife served the simply
prepared local snapper, pompano and mackerel. In 1921, at the
suggestion of a visiting Harvard University ichthyologist, Joe's
started serving stone crabs.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Joe's caters to 14,000 people a week, serving a ton of
stone crabs alone on a typical day. (On a busy night, the wait for
a table is two to three hours.) On Dec. 23, it served 2,900 pounds,
a record for the restaurant. During crab season, it will serve
about 250 tons.
</P>
<P>
   But lately, stone crabs are turning up far from Miami, at
restaurants like Legal Sea Foods in Boston and the Grand Central
Oyster Bar, City Crab and American Park at the Battery in New York,
where they sell for up to $10 a claw. Joe's recently opened Joe's
Seafood, Prime Steaks and Stone Crabs in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   In Florida, stone crabs come in six sizes: medium (eight to a
serving), select (seven), large (five), junior jumbo (four) jumbo
(three) and colossal (two). An order of colossals at Joe's can cost
more than $65. But does size matter? I prefer large stone crabs,
closely followed by the selects. The chunks of claw meat are large
enough to sink your teeth into, but small enough to be tender.
Colossals have ``wow'' power, but I find the meat a little tough.
</P>
<P>
   In Florida, stone crab prices are up $3 to $5 a pound over last
year in fish markets. At the retail level in New York, prices may
be up $5 to $10 a pound. It's unclear whether the increases are the
result of demand after Hurricane Irene, millennium demand, simply a
shortage of crabs, or all three. Every year, the crabbers, like
crabbers everywhere, complain of a lousy catch.
</P>
<P>
   But Russell Nelson, the director of the division of marine
fisheries of the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission,
said the stone crab catch has remained fairly constant over the
last 15 years, ranging between 3 million and 3.5 million pounds.
</P>
<P>
   He estimated that 600,000 crab traps would keep the catch at
that level but that in recent years, the number of traps used in
Florida has doubled, to more than 1.2 million. ``This many traps
makes it harder for everyone to make a living and causes conflicts
between fishermen, recreational boaters and even other sea life,''
Nelson said.
</P>
<P>
   The factnly the claws are taken protects the crab
population. ``We've been able to keep a healthy and abundant
fishery,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At the urging of the crabbing industry, the division has come up
with a plan to reduce the number of traps by using a complex
formula of trap fees and transfer limits. The aim is to protect the
industry without penalizing the fishermen.
</P>
<P>
   On the seven-hour day I spent with him, Nastaszczuk gathered 38
pounds of claws, most of them jumbos, a catch worth $500. Of
course, stone crab season lasts only seven months and there are
plenty of days when bad weather keeps him on shore. Then, there are
the traps to build, at a cost of $15 apiece; the boat to maintain;
the fuel and insurance to purchase. The average stone crabber is
lucky to make $30,000 a year, Nastaszczuk said.
</P>
<P>
   In February, if the commission approves the plan, it will go
before the Florida State Legislature, which alone can set the
necessary fees. If passed, the plan will go into effect next year.
</P>
<P>
   Most diners, in big restaurants and tiny fish shacks, are
oblivious to those issues. And most are content just to eat the
claws straight, with only the simplest of sauces, although Florida
chefs are also more creative. Allen Susser of Chef Allen's in North
Miami serves a salad of stone crab and tangerines with a
vinaigrette made with fennel and mustard seeds. (The mustard seeds
pay homage to the mustard sauce traditionally served with stone
crabs.) Mark Militello of Mark's Las Olas in Fort Lauderdale and
the new Mark's South Beach at the Hotel Nash in Miami Beach fries
the claws in tempura batter and serves them with an Asian-flavored
mustard sauce.
</P>
<P>
   But for most Floridians, stone crabs are a simple pleasure.
Stephen Sawitz of Joe's put it best: ``There's the ritual of being
shown the platter and shelling the claws, the almost baptismal rite
of dipping the meat in clarified butter or mustard sauce. Even the
finger bowls have a ritual quality.''

ISRAEL AND PALESTINIANS AGREE ON SECOND LAND TRANSFER IN WEST
BANK 
</HEADLINE>
 (With MIDEAST-TALKS) 
(nk) 
 By DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Israel will transfer another chunk of the West Bank
to the Palestinians by Thursday after negotiators resolved a
lingering dispute over the land on Tuesday, ending a stalemate that
had dispirited both sides.
</P>
<P>
   After maps were signed Tuesday night, Israel was expected to
turn over 5 percent of the West Bank to the Palestinian Authority
within 48 hours. Most of the land is an unpopulated swath of the
Judean Desert.
</P>
<P>
   Israel and the Palestinian Authority also agreed Tuesday that
the transfer of an additional 6.1 percent of the West Bank would
take place by Jan. 20, as scheduled in the most recent agreement.
</P>
<P>
   That would give the Palestinians full or partial control of 40
percent of the West Bank as they head into intensive negotiations
with Israel aimed at a framework agreement for a final status
accord by Feb. 13. It also would give them jurisdiction over almost
their entire population in the West Bank and Gaza, with the crucial
exception of those who live in Jerusalem. ``After excessive
deliberations, we have reached an understanding between us and our
Israeli counterparts,'' Saeb Erekat, a senior Palestinian
negotiator, said Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when the spotlight is shining on high-level
Israeli-Syrian peace talks in West Virginia, a breakthrough on the
Israeli-Palestinian track seemed particularly significant. It
heartened some Palestinians and some Israeli peace advocates who
have doubted that the Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, could
successfully juggle two full-fledged peace negotiations at once.
</P>
<P>
   The deadlock that ended Tuesday was initially brok
secretive, late-night meeting between Barak and Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat in Ramallah 12 days ago. But it took so long for the
details to be hammered out by negotiators that many Israelis and
Palestinians feared that the progress made that night had been
undone, and that the attention of Barak, now in the United States,
had shifted to peace negotiations with Syria.
</P>
<P>
   Originally Israel had been prepared to turn over the land on
Nov. 15. It was to have been the second of three Israeli
withdrawals scheduled under the latest peace agreement. The
agreement was signed between Barak and Arafat in a jubilant
ceremony at Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, in September. The first
withdrawal took place on time in mid-September.
</P>
<P>
   But, in November, the Palestinians objected to the withdrawal
maps and to the process. First, the Palestinians were pushing to
receive populated areas near Jerusalem, whose status is contested
and whose fate is under negotiation in the final status talks. They
also argued that the process should be more consultative, rather
than one in which Israel selected the territory that it would
transfer.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the Palestinians apparently settled for the land
that Israel had been offering in the first place. A senior
Palestinian official said Tuesday that the Palestinians ended up
with ``a better deal.'' But the Israeli and Palestinians
negotiators would not comment on what had transpired to change the
Palestinians' stance.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   It is possible that something in the negotiations over the third
Israeli withdrawal satisfied the Palestinians' demand to get more
populated land. Or, as Palestinian analysts said they believed, it
might be that the Israelis made clear that they would seek and take
into account Palestinian views on future map disputes.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Speaking together to reporters, the Israeli and Palestinian lead
negotiators implied that something in the relationship had shifted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every moment we act as partners we find solutions,'' Erekat
said. ``This is the key.''
</P>
<P>
   Oded Eran, negotiator for the Israelis, said: ``Both sides
understood that the issues of the 5 percent and the 6.1 percent are
important but that there are more important issues _ that is the
future and the permanent relationships between the two of us. We
found a way of removing these issues from the agenda that is
satisfactory to both sides and enabled us to move forward.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Also on Tuesday, in a small but significant indication that the
diplomatic landscape is changing, Arafat, for the first time, rode
by car from Ramallah to Gaza through Israel. Arafat almost always
travels by helicopter, but heavy rains prevented his flight Tuesday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Late for a meeting with an important Egyptian cleric, Arafat
sought and received permission from the Israelis to make the ground
trip by chauffeured Mercedes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the first hrough Israel, but we couldn't see
anything because it was foggy and rainy,'' a Palestinian official
said. ``We left in a convoy from Ramallah and the Israeli escorts
followed us from far behind so as not to call attention to what was
happening.''

 &HT;    Nichols named head of Flooring America
 &HT;    By Patti Bond
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Flooring America has a new chairman, David L. Nichols
</P>
<P>
   The move, announced Tuesday, came a day after the Kennesaw,
Ga.-based floor covering retailer changed its corporate name from
Maxim Group. Nichols, former chairman and chief executive of
Mercantile Stores, will begin his new post on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   He replaces Ron McSwain, whose seven months in the post marked a
period of significant turmoil for the company. Most of last year
was consumed with a downward restatement of fiscal 1999 earnings
and a lengthy forensic audit. Meanwhile, Maxim Group was trying to
stem losses and cut costs at stores it acquired from ShawIndustries.
</P>
<P>
   Those responsibilities were too time-consuming for a chairman
who also operated a regional chain of 11 flooring franchises,
McSwain said. ``Due to other business commitments I cannot take a
role in the day-to-day operations of Flooring America, which the
board and I agree the chairman's role requires,'' McSwain said in a
statement. He was elected chairman in June, replacing M.B.
Seretean.
</P>
<P>
   McSwain, president of Cincinnati-based McSwain Carpets, will
continue to operate the chain as a franchisee of Flooring America.
</P>
<P>
   With Nichols, Flooring America has a hands-on chairman who'll be
heavily involved with Wall Street, said Tom Leahey, executive vice
president, finance. Nichols led a sweeping reorganization and
renovation of Mercantile stores in the early 1990s. He left the
company when it was acquired by Dillard's in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``David's real expertise is in the capital markets,'' Leahey
said. ``He'll focus on (technology) and dealing with financial
community.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Chief Executive A.J. Nassar will concentrate on
cutting costs and running the retail business, which includes 1,050
stores, Leahey said.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, the company has been shoring up its management
team with executives who have financial expertise. For example,
Leonard Thill, a former accountant with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, was hired last fall to tackle the company's accounting
problems.
</P>
<P>
   On a down day for the stock market in general, Flooring America
was one of a limited number of Georgia-based companies whose shares
gained ground. The stock rose 43 3/4 cents to $6.43 3/4.
</P>
<P>
   ABOUT DAVID L. NICHOLS
</P>
<P>
   _ Job: Chairman, Flooring America
</P>
<P>
   _ Age: 58
</P>
<P>
   _ Previous positions: Chairman and chief executive of Mercantile
Stores, formerly based in Fairfield, Ohio. His 35-year career with
the department store chain included posts as chief financial
officer and president of the company's Lion Store division.
</P>
<P>
   _ Other board service: Andersons, Federal Reserve Bank of
Cleveland and Value City Department Stores.

&HT;     MONICA'S ON HER OWN 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Monica's back. She should have stayed away.
</P>
<P>
   The legend of the sexpot who nearly brought down a presidency is
far more interesting than the real person.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton isn't the only one with reason to forget about
her.
</P>
<P>
   She's still a media magnet, but it's all for pictures. She's a
looker, no matter how plump. Yet she has nothing to say, and we
have nothing to say to her.
</P>
<P>
   Forbidden by her immunity agreement to discuss her only claim to
fame, the tawdry affair with President Clinton, Monica Lewinsky
behind all those teeth and the big hair is an empty dress.
</P>
<P>
   She came out of temporary hiding this week to give interviews
promoting her new role as a paid shill of Jenny Craig, a diet
system on which she has lost 30 pounds. But in this sexless
incarnation, the former White House intern comes across as a
shallow, boring young woman as selfishly obsessed with herself as
Clinton is with himself.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday night Lewinsky giggled her way through a shallow CNN
interview with Larry King, whose skills as a serious questioner
were sorely tested by her girlish gushing. If she has anything in
her head but her therapy sessions, her dating problems, her eating
habits and her celebrity status, it did not surface. She is, she
says, ``working on myself.''
</P>
<P>
   She is 26 years old, a public figure against her will and no
longer the innocent ingenue she still pretends to be. Some maturity
should have set in by now, but there's little evidence of that.
</P>
<P>
   She says she would like to marry. No surprise here: She used to
dream idiotically of wedding bells with Clinton. She has never been
particularly serious about preparing for a career, particularly if
it involved hard work. She is, however, trying to use her notoriety
to make money.
</P>
<P>
   Her reputation naturally makes it difficult to find suitable
corporate employment or any job dealing with the public these days.
As she told King, it would be ``too chaotic'' for her to hold a
traditional job.
</P>
<P>
   That's putting it mildly. Can you imagine the reaction of a
CEO's wife if she heard her husband had hired the uninhibited,
unskilled female who suggestively flashed her thong to entice an
emotionally immature president?
</P>
<P>
   Before Lewinsky's affair with the president was discovered,
however, she asked Clinton confidant Vernon Jordan to get her a
snazzy job in New York that paid well but didn't require too much
effort. She also mused about going to law school if she could get
out of taking the entrance exams.
</P>
<P>
   After the Senate failed to convict the president of lying and
obstructing justice, she helped writer Andrew Morton produce a
gooey, self-serving book about her life called ``Monica's Story.''
At first a curiosity, it initially hit the best-seller category but
had no literary staying power and dropped out of the top-50 list
within four weeks.
</P>
<P>
   She then tried selling over the Internet handbags that she
claims sold out before Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's on to making money from being full-figured. She's less
tubby but still no Twiggy and will earn more money from Jenny Craig
if she loses an additional 15 pounds. No word about what happens if
she can't keep the weight off very long. In the past, s
dresses in several sizes in her closet, reflecting the ups and
downs of previous diets.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who has also fought against gaining weight all his
life, could relate to her earlier plumpness, as could this
columnist and many others. His and her mutual struggle to slim down
was a bond between them, not a turnoff.
</P>
<P>
   Nutrition experts say more than half of us weigh too much and
about a fifth of us are positively obese. But it isn't easy getting
thin.
</P>
<P>
   Jenny Craig is reaping loads of publicity from this, and the
company's stock went up when Lewinsky's affiliation surfaced. Being
overweight is a real problem, bringing social discrimination and
difficulty finding clothes that fit as well as health
complications. According to a recent USA Today/CNN/Gallup Poll,
about 58 percent of Americans would like to lose weight but 54
percent of those aren't trying. They have given up or don't want to the trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Monica Lewinsky isn't much of an inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   It is doubtful that her example will make much difference on our
own bathroom scales. She's a better symbol of self-indulgence than
discipline.

`MY CENTURY': 100 YEARS OF INCERTITUDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (editors: publication notes at end of review)  
 (bl)  
 By RICHARD BERNSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Works of literature are rarely if ever created for an occasion _
a birthday, an anniversary, the passing of a millennium _ and that
is perhaps the reason ``My Century,'' Guenter Grass' fictional
gloss on the past 100 years, falls so flat. Grass, who won the
Nobel Prize in Literature last year, has, like his German
predecessor Thomas Mann, produced powerfully imaginative fables of
grotesque politics and personal fate. ``The Tin Drum,'' his
masterpiece, is indisputably one of the great novels since World
War II.
</P>
<P>
   But ``My Century,'' in which Grass produces a vignette for each
year since 1900, has only flashes of the brilliance of his best
work. More often it drifts, plods and fails to stir the mind or
heart in the way that one might expect when a writer of this
stature deals with a mighty subject.
</P>
<P>
   Grass does deserve credit for writing a strange book and one
that captures the kaleidoscopic quality of the 100 years just past.
But it is a pale, watery sort of kaleidoscope, providing
unsatisfactorily fragmentary glances at people and events that
disappear almost as soon as they are seen.
</P>
<P>
   He uses ever changing narrators who succeed one another through
the generations, beginning with a foot soldier in the European and
American expeditionary force that was sent to relieve the siege of
the foreign legation during the Boxer Rebellion in China. There are
civil servants and bureaucrats, writers, working-class housewives,
an employee of Deutsche Grammophon who in 1907 goes to Moscow and
signs up the great Chaliapin to an exclusive contract.
</P>
<P>
   But with a few exceptions _ notably the working-class women
scattered through these pages _ the voices, while recounting
different experiences, are similar in tone and very similar in
their storytelling technique.
</P>
<P>
   That technique is the overused one of trying, with a few teaser
sentences at the beginning of each segment, to keep the reader from
knowing for a while exactly who is talking or what is taking place.
So the entry for 1934 begins: ``Just between the two of us, the
matter should have been handled better. I let myself by carried
away by personal considerations.''
</P>
<P>
   The speaker here is a guard at the Dachau and Oranienburg
concentration camps whose principal concern is bureaucratic
politics. The point is the way in which historical actors lose
sight of when they are as moral agents. But the technique of
presentation is used often enough to become wearying. Many of
Grass' narrators suffer from a form of historical myopia, so they
see events not in grand terms but solipsistically, for their
personal effect. The main years of World War II, for example, are
covered by a single narrator, who, in 1962, participates in a
three-day meeting of journalists looking back, each in his own way,
on the disaster of the recent past. The assembled journalists talk
about missed opportunities as if World War II had been a lost
football game rather than an apocalyptic effort to realize a vast
criminal vision.
</P>
<P>
   A photographer who recorded the liquidation of the Warsaw Ghetto
in 1943 complains that he received no royalties, not even for his
most famous picture, ``showing a group of women and children with
their hands up and our men on the right and in the background
pointing their guns at them.'' He continues, ``Not a penny have I
earned, not a single measly mark.''
</P>
<P>
   When Grass, who was born in 1937, gets closer to our own times,
he becomes his own narrator, talking mostly of his leftist
political ideas and of his tortured avoidance of the radical
extreme. He thinks back to the 1960s, agonizing over a set of
questions too obscure to summarize here, but having to do with a
poem by Paul Celan in which he awaits some acknowledgment from
philosopher Martin Heidegger of Heidegger's collaboration with the
Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   Grass delves into several subjects: the left's disenchantment
with the great sociologist and philosopher Theodor Adorno; the
shooting of Rudi Dutschke, the provocateur of the German student
movement; a meeting between Celan and Heidegger. These episodes,
which take up the years from 1966 to 1968, could have been a
fascinating excursion into recent German politics, but in ``My
Century'' they come across as arcane, tangential, unfocused, even
as Grass himself seems to be posing for an author's photograph
while bearing the weight of some Heavy Question on his thin
shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   ``When did it occur, my `turn?''' he asks, using the word turn
in an existential Heideggerean sense. ``What caused me to take
leave from `merely being'? And precisely when during all those
years did the sublime take hold of me, never _ a temporary `turning
away' notwithstanding _ to let go?''
</P>
<P>
   Some of Grass' segments, like the one with the Warsaw Ghetto
photographer, provide the sort of absurdist insight that one
expects from this author. His passage on 1989, the year the Berlin
Wall came down, is about a man pleased to learn that German
unification has occurred because he needs snow tires, and they are
hard to get in the suddenly defunct East where he lives. Or there
is the grandfather of 1978, a prominent banker in the Nazi era, who
unwittingly cures his grandchildren of their love for punk by
becoming punk himself, shaving his head and sticking safety pins
into his ear lobes, before being committed to an asylum.
</P>
<P>
   These episodes have a wryly distanced quality that is itself
perhaps Grass' central comment on the 100 years just past,
accentuating as it does the impossibility of a full engagement with
the historical colossus that the century was. A willfully vague
semiunderstanding pervades the collective mentality represented by
his various voices and points of view in confrontation with the
unfathomable.
</P>
<P>
   But ``My Century'' remains a work whose parts, while
sporadically gripping and uniformly intelligent, do not manage to
add up to a coherent, gripping or illuminating whole. One reads
these mostly forgettable fragments, and one hopes for the years to
provide more literary or moral mass than they attain in what is a
strange, searching, yet disappointing book.

 &HT;    Enthusiasts wait for tide of online banking
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Despite all the talk about online banking and using
the Internet to manage money and pay bills, not everyone is sure
people actually want to do it that way.
</P>
<P>
   Jagdish Sheth doesn't think most people do. Sheth is a marketing
professor who studies social change at Emory University's Goizueta
School of Business.
</P>
<P>
   Industry analysts think this will be the year the market for
Internet banking takes off.
</P>
<P>
   Alpharetta, Ga.-based Net.Bank plans to spend $10 million _ $3
million more than last year _ to get more customers.
</P>
<P>
   And Steve Franco, an analyst with U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray,
thinks the stocks of companies such as Atlanta-based S1, which
helps banks offer their services online, and CheckFree, a Norcross,
Ga., firm that processes electronic transactions, will benefit.
</P>
<P>
   But Sheth thinks most people will be reluctant to change, and
that mass adoption of online banking and bill-paying will come
slowly.
</P>
<P>
   He's found that if people are comfortable with the way they do
things, and there is risk associated with a new way, they will
stick to the old way. They will change their habits if they are
unhappy with the traditional method and there is not much risk to
the new one.
</P>
<P>
   Applied to online banking and bill-paying, that means most
people are more comfortable with pen and paper checks and
brick-and-mortar bank branches than they are with the Internet,
Sheth said. The average banking customer will have to be dragged
clicking and scrolling into the digital age, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``For it to work, you need universal presence of PCs in
families,'' Sheth said. ``There is much more opportunity in the
business-to-business market. Converting small business and
household consumers will be harder. ... It's the easiest way, but
not everyone does it. Not everyone feels comfortable. Not everyone
owns a PC. The more you move into the mass market, the more
hesitation and obstacles will be present.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheth knows some consumers already are open to the idea of
managing their money online. His 32 year-old son works long, odd
hours and wants to be able to bank when he wants.
</P>
<P>
   ``The professional class likes managing their money,'' he said.
``They are technology-enabled, and they like it. They don't like
going to the bank. They don't like to mix with the masses. They
want to be able to bank when they want. They will adopt it
immediately. The masses, however, the people in small towns, the
people with a high school education or less, are about 70 percent
of the population. They are the backbone of the U.S., and they are
very comfortable going to the bank, meeting with the teller. They
will be last. They will be the most resistant and only will change
if they are forced to.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheth compares banking to the telephone. A generation of
Americans had operators dial their calls. Now all calls are
automated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do-it-yourself banking is inevitable,'' he said. ``But it
won't happen next year.''
</P>
<P>
   D.R. Grimes, Net.Bank's chief executive, thinks the demand is
there. He saw his company's accounts grow from 17,400 last January
to 66,000 this week. Grimes said he thinks that in 10 years, online
banking will be as popular as automated teller machines.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Net.Bank ran print ads, bought radio time and placed
ads on Web sites. A certain type of person responded and enrolled:
married people between the ages of 40 and 45 with a yearly income
greater than $60,000.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Net.Bank plans to sell more services _ credit cards,
home equity loans _ to existing customers. Net.Bank also hopes to
reach out to more types of people: college students, military
personnel and Americans living overseas.
</P>
<P>
   It also plans to deepen relationships with certain places, such
as the Microsoft Network's MoneyCentral Web site. Grimes said the
company's ads work best in places where people research money and
investment issues.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Bancorp's Franco thought the end of 1999 _ when Y2K bug
worries subsided _ was when the industry would take off, and he was
not alone. Now he thinks that prediction was about six months
early.
</P>
<P>
   Franco thinks consumers, not corporations, will be the first to
adopt the practice in a big way. He expects there to be between 40
million and 50 million people banking and paying their bills online
by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are 25 million regular users of the Internet checking
stock quotes, tracking portfolios and getting financial
information,'' he said. ``That is a ripe customer segment to target
those services to. If you are sophisticated enough to set up a
portfolio on Yahoo, you can manage your money online.''

 &HT;    Ready for next step
 &HT;    By Ernest Holsendolph
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ An up-and-coming Chamblee, Ga., company has put a new
spin on the ancient quest for better materials, becoming an
important player in the improvement of electronic technology.
</P>
<P>
   MicroCoating Technologies, founded in the business incubator on
the Georgia Tech campus in 1993 by native Atlantan Andrew T. Hunt,
is built on a slender but sturdy base.
</P>
<P>
   And now the company is poised to take the step that all
start-ups dream of _ going public, raising substantial capital and
beginning the next level of growth.
</P>
<P>
   MCT's business revolves around a thin metal coating that can
conduct electricity very efficiently.
</P>
<P>
   The thinness, about one-hundredth of the width of a human hair,
is only one of its valuable features. Unlike similar coatings by
other companies, the MCT product can be created in open air _ not
restricted to vacuum chambers.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the most important uses of the coating technology, the
thin coatings replace traditional resistors and capacitors soldered
to printed wiring boards. The technology allows the resistors and
capacitors to be incorporated within the thin layer, resulting in
dramatically smaller _ and faster _ printed wiring boards.
</P>
<P>
   On the electronic front, the substitutions of coating for
traditional boards are called imbedded passives and are used the
whole range of equipment, from mainframe computers to portable
gadgets like cell phones, pocket computers and calculators.
</P>
<P>
   In one project, MCT has teamed with Shipley Co., a subsidiary of
Rohm and Haas, to commercialize the technology for big chip makers
like Intel.
</P>
<P>
   The usefulness of the process is underlined by MCT's
contributions to products beyond pure electronics, to include
catalytic products for companies as diverse as General Motors,
AlliedSignal, Amoco/Enron Solar, Sematech and the federal
Department of Energy.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Kelly of Noro-Moseley, the investment company, says MCT's
strength is its adaptability, its ability to improve electronic and
other processes for many industries and companies ranging from
Qualcomm to Intel to Sun Microsystems and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   The process, called combustion chemical vapor deposition, or
CCVD, was established by Hunt working in his back yard on Memorial
Day in 1993, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bof our process, we can produce continuously and not in
batches, as others do,'' said Hunt. He invented and patented the
process during the final year of work on his doctorate in materials
and engineering at Tech.
</P>
<P>
   Though he estimates that for the near future some 70 percent of
his coatings will go to electronic products, Hunt says they are
being adapted to other uses as diverse as fuel cells and solar
instruments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, we think the lighter material and its superior
efficiency can help eliminate lead in circuit boards, and reduce
weight and size of electronic gear,'' said Hunt.
</P>
<P>
   Though electronic circuitry is the glamour entry in the world of
electronics, capturing the eyes of investors, materials research
and development can be a powerful driver, too, Hunt says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Material is everything; all else is immaterial,'' he says with
a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   MCT has had no trouble selling to others the excitement of
materials research. The little company has grown to 102 employees,
half holding advanced degrees in subjects like engineering,
chemistry, chemical engineering and materials.
</P>
<P>
   ``What makes us really proud is that we have achieved our growth
mostly by `bootstrapping,'' '' Hunt said. Bootstrapping means
growing mostly from daily revenues rather than through extensive
borrowing. It is a time-honored way of growing among small
businesses, but it is hard to do while developing a
capital-intensive business like MicroCoating Technologies.
</P>
<P>
   The company's lifeline is talent and the expensive equipment it
takes to conduct research and produce the coating product.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is the company driven by an educated work force, it is
a richly diverse work force.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have some 14 nationalities represented and 20 languages
spoken,'' said David L. Motley, who left a corporate job in
Pittsburgh to cast his lot with MCT as vice president of strategic
planning and marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Like many new, young companies in emerging technologies, MCT has
adopted a special style.
</P>
<P>
   The company pays all employees at least partly in stock options
and through profit-sharing. Moreover, the company functions as a
team, with all 100 employees meeting weekly to hear reports and
give their suggestions for managing the growth.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Shark, a 1992 graduate of Valparaiso University and now
treasurer of the young company, says the lively teamwork atmosphere
is something she found attractive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our product and the ideas it spins off create excitement,''
she said, ``but what make the place special is that we work as
equals, and together, with everybody's ideas a part of what we do.
...''
</P>
<P>
   It is a place where everybody, from the receptionist to the
Georgia Tech interns to the chief of technology, all know what's
cooking in the company and the latest progress.
</P>
<P>
   The teamwork can be seen in the work areas, where groups of six
or seven work around their own clusters of machines _ but in open
areas, where all can communicate.
</P>
<P>
   They work on developing ways to use the product to meet the
needs of various corporate clients.
</P>
<P>
   The company's growth has been mostly in the
research-and-development area, in tasks done in alliance with big
suppliers of parts to tech powers like Intel.
</P>
<P>
   But now the company is edging its way into the production area,
to become a direct supplier in its own right.
</P>
<P>
   This next level of development has sent the company into the
marketplace for major capital financing. Previously, the company's
only outside financing _ aside from a handful of government grants
to start _ has been from a $4 million equity package from venture
capital firm Noro-Moseley last year.
</P>
<P>
   Having gone as far as it can on bootstrapping and a minimal
reliance on outside help, the company could go public as early as
the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Hunt and his management team will not disclose revenues, but a
technology company of its type usually generates $100,000 to
$200,000 or more per employee, which could put it in the $200
million range in revenues.
</P>
<P>
   The coatings technology business is estimated to be in the range
of $100 billion a year, Hunt says, and he believes that MCT's
production efficiency and savvy development team can garner a nice
share of that market growth.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, MCT is bursting at the seams in its
35,000-square-foot work area. The company is angling for new space
that could reach 200,000 square feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to stay right here in the city, in DeKalb (County,
Ga.), and we want to continue to be an environmentally friendly
business, producing a product that could also succeed and be a boon
to the environment,'' said Hunt.

OPPOSITION COALITION WINS ELECTIONS IN CROATIA
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRAGUE, Czech Republic _ Croatia's center-left opposition won a
sweeping victory in Monday's parliamentary elections, the official
results indicated Tuesday, delivering a sharp rebuke to the ruling
party and opening up the prospect of warmer ties between Croatia
and the West.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition's victory dethroned the Croatian Democratic
Union, or HDZ, the umbrella nationalist party founded by President
Franjo Tudjman, who died last month. The HDZ has ruled Croatia
since Tudjman took the country to independence in 1991 out of the
wreckage of Tito's Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   With more than 80 percent of the vote counted Tuesday, the main
opposition bloc formed by the Social Democrats, who were led by
Ivica Racan, a former Communist Party leader, and the Social
Liberals, led by Drazen Budisa, a former dissident, had a clear
lead in eight out of 11 constituencies.
</P>
<P>
   Racan, 55, looks likely to become prime minister. He will also
have the voting support of a smaller, allied opposition coalition
of four other parties.
</P>
<P>
   At their headquarters, Racan and Budisa triumphantly raised
their arms high while supporters cheered. Racan said, ``We were
aware of people's feelings. We'll do our best to justify their
confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   But Racan added later, ``We will need a lot of sacrifices on all
sides in order to turn things around soon.''
</P>
<P>
   The HDZ has conceded defeat, but the exact size of its
embarrassment _ and of the opposition's new majority _ is subject
to Croatia's complicated system of proportional representation. It
is made more complex by an 11th constituency made up of the
Croatian diaspora _ mostly Bosnian Croats and emigres who maintain
dual citizenship and can vote in Croatian elections. Ethnic
minorities are guaranteed another five seats.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts were predicting that Racan's bloc could win 70 or 71 of
140 fixed seats in a new parliament but would probably need the
support of its coalition ally, which could take 24 seats. This
would create a working majority in a parliament with as many as 150
total seats. The HDZ would still have 40 or 41 seats. But the six
opposition parties appeared to have fallen short of the two-thirds
majority they would need to enact constitutional changes, including
diminishing presidential power.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have lost the election, but I pledge that we shall be a
very serious and firm opposition,'' the HDZ's current foreign
minister, Mate Granic, said early Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Granic, a moderate in the party, is Washington's choice to
replace Tudjman and become Croatia's new president in separate
elections Jan. 24. The size of the HDZ defeat is likely to hurt his
chances, but it may accelerate the breakup of the party or push it
more to the center. The main opposition candidate will be Budisa in
what will be a crowded field.
</P>
<P>
   A second round runoff on Feb. 7 may be necessary for any
candidate to win the required majority of more than 50 percent of
the votes.
</P>
<P>
   Under Tudjman and the HDZ, Croatia slipped into economic
decline, with high unemployment and widespread allegations of
corruption, which were the issues that fed the opposition's
victory. But Croatia was run as an outwardly democratic autocracy,
with all effective power concentrated in the presidency and the
party, and there were strict controls over state television in the
style of neighboring Serbia, run by the Yugoslav president,
Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews, Racan has promised media freedom, respect for
human rights and more cooperation with the West over Bosnia and
with the international tribunal looking into war crimes in the
former Yugoslavia. In the past, Zagreb has been reluctant to hand
over wanted suspects, though it has cooperated well compared to
Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Tudjman had a contentious relationship with Washington and the
West. His nationalism was expressed loudly and he meddled in
Bosnia, promoting a separate Croatian entity while formally
supporting the Federation of Croats and Muslims that Washington
imposed on him. He said he had discovered plots to undermine
Croatian independence and sovereignty, and organized intelligence
networks both in Croatia and in Bosnia to spy on Western diplomats,
journalists, businessmen and aid workers.
</P>
<P>
   Racan does not share such suspicions, he says, although he is
careful not to offend the deeply nationalist streak in the Croatian
public. But his new government could lead to an early rapprochement
with the West and the European Union, with more rapid consideration
of Croatia's application to join the European Union and a
resumption of its aid.
</P>
<P>
   Washington is also more likely to provide more economic aid and
allow Croatia at last to join NATO's Partnership for Peace, a
program for potential NATO members.
</P>
<P>
   Racan has promised a difficult and politically painful economic
restructuring of Croatia, with a 17 percent cut in its budgetary
spending, a reduction of onerous taxes, a more open and honest
privatization of state industries and banks and efforts to reduce
unemployment, which exceeds 20 percent. He says he will cut some
official salaries in half, including the pay of legislators.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Clinton administration hopes that the victory of the
opposition, which it has supported, will be a model for the
squabbling democrats in nearby Serbia. The Croatian opposition has
overcome its own divisions and the unfairness, as the Organization
for Security and Cooperation in Europe describes it, of an early
election date chosen by the HDZ.
</P>
<P>
   But any comparison of Croatia and Serbia is flawed, senior
European diplomats in Croatia acknowledge. Milosevic, who is only
58, remains in good health and controls all the levers of state
power, including the state media. And he runs the former Communist
Party, which never lost control in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Washington had urged unity on Croatia's political opposition and
provided it with significant advice and aid through direct and
indirect funding of nongovernmental organizations. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright made a point of inviting Croatian
opposition leaders to the United States, and they all went except
for Budisa, who feared offending his nationalist supporters.
</P>
<P>
   With this victory, Albright is expected to make an early visit
to Zagreb to ``reward'' Croatians for voting the opposition into
power, in another effort to send a message to Belgrade, American
officials say. That would offer a sharp contrast to the low level
of diplomatic representation at Tudjman's funeral on Dec. 13, which
only the American ambassador attended on behalf of the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Budisa, in a news interview published Tuesday, said, ``Our
immediate task is to pull Croatia out of economic crisis, remove
anomalies in our democratic system and to lure the country out of
international isolation.''
</P>
<P>
   The high election turnout was estimated at more than 78 percent
of Croatia's nearly 4.2 million eligible voters.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton said Tuesday he would nominate
Alan Greenspan to a fourth four-year term as chairman of the
Federal Reserve.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made the announcement at the White House after meeting
in the Oval Office on Tuesday morning with Greenspan, whose
inflation-fighting efforts are widely credited with providing the
foundation for the long economic expansion and the record-setting
bull market on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan, a conservative Republican who was first appointed to
the post by President Reagan in 1987, has won support from across
the political spectrum for his deft touch in keeping the economy on
track. Members of both parties said there is no question that his
nomination will be approved by the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan, 73, has made no secret of his desire to stay on, and
Tuesday's news was a surprise only in that it came so far in
advance of the expiration of his term of June.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he had to persuade Greenspan to accept another term,
Clinton responded, ``No. I asked him and he said yes.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Fed chairman standing at his side, Clinton praised
Greenspan for his role in nurturing an expansion that next month
will become the longest in the nation's history, with all the
benefits it has brought in low unemployment, rising wages and
reduced welfare rolls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, wise leadership from the Fed has played a very large
role in our strong economy,'' Clinton said. ``That is why today I
am pleased to announce my decision to renominate Alan Greenspan as
chairman of the Federal Reserve Board.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said Greenspan's ``wise and steady leadership has
inspired confidence, not only here in America but all around the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan in turn warmly praised Clinton and his economic team,
with whom he has worked closely in overhauling the nation's banking
laws, containing the global financial crisis that rocked Asia
several years ago and monitoring the rapid changes that technology
has brought to the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan said he had enjoyed every minute of the job, and
suggested his enthusiasm for it was undiminished.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really been an extraordinary challenge, and especially
for an economist who likes to get into the nitty-gritty of every
statistic you've ever seen,'' Greenspan said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked by a reporter to comment on the stock market, Greenspan
reverted to his usual silence, declining to answer.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had dropped broad hints last year that he would like to
reappoint Greenspan. Vice President Al Gore has been a strong
backer of reappointing Greenspan, as have Gov. George W. Bush of
Texas, the front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination,
and his chief rival in the Republican primaries, Sen. John McCain
of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan's reappointment was also sure to be welcomed on Wall
Street, which at times has been exasperated by the Fed chairman's
suggestions that stock prices are overvalued but has profited
enormously from the climate of low inflation and steady growth that
he has helped to create.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton's announcement did little to help stocks Tuesday.
Prices fell sharply on Wall Street throughout the morning, in part
because of expectations that Greenspan would raise interest rates
next month to slow the economy and prevent a buildup of
inflationary pressures.
</P>
<P>
   By reappointing Greenspan well before his term expired, Clinton
seemed to be trying to stick to his administration's strategy of
insulating the Fed from politics as much as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan is all but certain to raise interest rates in coming
months, and might have to engineer a series of rate increases as
the election year progresses if the economy does not slow, analysts
said. And although Gore, Bush and McCain all support Greenspan, the
Fed chairman has come under criticism on the Republican side from
Steve Forbes, who says Greenspan is too quick to assume that strong
growth will generate inflation. And Greenspan has gotten only
lukewarm support from former Sen. Bill Bradley, Gore's chief rival
for the Democratic nomination.

 &HT;    Fashion, not stock cars, starts their engines
 &HT;    By Lyle V. Harris
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Marquise Young doesn't watch stock car racing on TV.
He's never heard of top NASCAR driver Jeff Gordon, and he regards
the men who make a living zooming around race tracks as ``a bunch
of crazy white people.''
</P>
<P>
   But when the black Decatur, Ga., high schooler made his
Christmas wish list, he asked for _ and got _ two colorfully
stylish racing jackets that make him look like he just took the
checkered flag at the Daytona 500.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nah, I don't like racing,'' said Young, 15, while walking
through a metro Atlanta mall wearing an oversize black, red, and
white jacket with a huge General Motors logo on the front. ``But
these jackets are tight. Everybody at my school is wearing them.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everybody, of course. However, Young is part of a curious
fashion trend among young African-Americans who say they don't give
a hoot about NASCAR, but are adopting the look of NASCAR's good old
boys as part of their wardrobes.
</P>
<P>
   Sold mostly in stores patronized by black shoppers, the
officially licensed jackets are made of wool, heavyweight cotton or
brightly colored leather. They usually range in price from about
$150 to as much as $1,200, although knockoffs can sell for as low
as $75.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the wearers are fans, but many acknowledge they don't
know the difference between Dale Earnhardt and Dale Jarrett, even
though the NASCAR drivers' names are embroidered on the front of
jackets.
</P>
<P>
   Instead they distinguish the jackets by the NASCAR sponsors'
emblems and colors prominently displayed on the sleeves, chest and
back panels. DuPont jackets are green, red and yellow; Mattel Hot
Wheels jackets are jet-black and light blue.
</P>
<P>
   A single jacket can have a half-dozen primary and secondary
logos, turning their owners into a walking billboard for Pepsi, Red
Lobster, Pontiac, Quaker State Oil, Kellogg's Corn Flakes, Burger
King or Super 8 Motels.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really care about the logos. I just liked it because
of the colors,'' said Chere Braden, 15, whose mother bought her a
NASCAR jacket. ``The only products I know on my jacket are Cheerios
and Betty Crocker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care about racing at all,'' she added. ``I flip by it
when it comes on TV.''
</P>
<P>
   Brian France, vice president of the $2 billion-a-year NASCAR
franchise his family founded, couldn't explain why the racing
jackets have become a hit with blacks who generally ignore the
sport. Nielsen ratings for 1999 show that about 4 percent of
viewers who watched stock car racing on TV were African-American.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if there is a scientific answer as to why they
are buying this merchandise,'' said France in a telephone interview
from Daytona, Fla. ``But I hope this will become an opportunity to
reach out to this community, because there's no question that this
is great advertising for us.''
</P>
<P>
   There are no African-American drivers racing on the NASCAR
circuit, but officials have been trying to change that by
sponsoring internship programs for students at historically black
colleges and giving financial backing to urban racing programs that
target young blacks.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe NASCAR should take a cue from Jeff Hamilton, the designer
who says the jackets helped put his Los Angeles-based company in
the winner's circle. After securing the licensing rights from
NASCAR and several well-known drivers, Hamilton used some shrewd
product placement techniques by putting his jackets on the backs of
high-profile rappers such as Busta Rhymes, Cam'ron and Li'l Cease.
</P>
<P>
   When the rappers started wearing the jackets in public, on TV
and in music videos, sales among the hip-hop generation started
revving up.
</P>
<P>
   ``My strategy was that people will buy this stuff because it's
marketed in a certain way,'' said Hamilton during a sales trip to
New York. ``Kids are very sophisticated, and if they see this stuff
on display at mom-and-pop retailers, they're not going to buy it.
If a rapper is wearing it, that's different.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fashion equals snobbery, and snobbery equals sales.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton wouldn't say how many NASCAR jackets he's sold, but if
imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, he's getting plenty of
compliments. Other urban designers including Phat Farm, Sean Jean,
Karl Kani and FUBU, who are coming out with racing jackets of their
own.
</P>
<P>
   The competition doesn't bother Isaiah Campbell, a 25-year-old
former Morehouse College student who represents Hamilton at 350
stores around the country and has formed his own company, Inner
City Blues. Campbell said a new line of NASCAR-inspired jeans,
jumpsuits and other racing apparel will keep the fad on track for a
few more years before it eventually runs out of gas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the clothing has made black people more aware of the
sport, but when the trend dies that's it,'' he said. ``I don't
expect black people to start showing up in the grandstands at
NASCAR races anytime soon.''

 &HT;    Don't give rodents safe haven in your home
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Thursday, Dec. 6.
 &HT;    By Alma E. Hill
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dan McConnell just got rid of some unwanted houseguests _ namely
chipmunks that had gnawed their way into his sun porch and a
squirrel that had holed up in the roof.
</P>
<P>
   ``He actually made a hole underneath the shingle, where the roof
meets the house,'' says McConnell, who lives with his family in
Marietta.
</P>
<P>
   The McConnells aren't alone in their quest to rid their home of
vermin. An estimated 21 million U.S. homes are invaded by rodents
each year. They can attack anytime; however, the peak season is
from October through February, when the creatures seek refuge from
the cold.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are swamped; we can't keep up with the calls,'' says Stan
Olstein, owner of Trutech Pest and Animal Control in Marietta, Ga.
``We're getting a terrific number of squirrel calls right now _ and
rats, racoons and possum.''
</P>
<P>
   Pests aren't picky about where they take up residence. They'll
dig a hole in a new home as quickly as an old one. All a mouse
needs is an opening large enough to stick a finger through. A
raccoon or possum can squeeze through a hole the size of a
softball.
</P>
<P>
   They can come through doggie doors, holes in walls, openings
around pipes and dryer ducts venting to the outside. The roof is
also a handy highway: Rats have access from trees that are close to
the house. That's where roof rats get their name.
</P>
<P>
   Rodents can be very destructive. They chew through wallboard,
gnaw on electrical wiring, and, if they get access to your food
supply, can cause contamination. They also carry disease and fleas,
and leave waste. According to the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, hantavirus, a lung disease, is carried by rodents.
Although the disease is rare, the CDC says hantavirus is contracted
primarily by inhaling airborne particles from rodent droppings,
urine or saliva left by infected rodents or through direct contact
with infected rodents.
</P>
<P>
   There are many products on the market designed to rid your home
of rodents, and most work effectively when used properly, experts
say.
</P>
<P>
   Snap traps and glue boards are available for $3 to $5 at home
and garden stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``I recommend saturation trapping for rats and mice,'' says Jeff
Jackson, professor of Wildlife Management at the University of
Georgia. ``I like to make it so he can't go 10 feet without finding
a trap.''
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to rats, Jackson said he prefers snap traps and
glue traps over poisons, because a poisoned rat could die in a wall
and start to decompose before the body can be found and removed.
</P>
<P>
   With a snap trap, you're guaranteed to find a body _ if the rat
goes for the bait and gets caught.
</P>
<P>
   To increase the chances of making a catch, Jackson recommends
putting a piece of cheese or a dab of peanut butter in the center
of the trap for a few days, leaving it in the unset position.
</P>
<P>
   ``Give them a free lunch for a few days so they will know where
it is and aren't afraid of the trap. Then start setting the
traps,'' Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
   But traps mean you have to deal with the trapped rodent, and
most people cringe at the idea of touching a dead rat or mouse.
Other traps, such as the d-Con Ultra-Set Covered Mouse Trap and
Catchmaster Baited Mouse Glue Trap have covers that make it
possible to dispose of the dead rodent without ever seeing or
touching it.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some people prefer leaving the job to a professional pest
control company. Some companies charge $250 to $340 to set traps,
depending on the size of the home and how many traps need to be
set.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to reduce your chances of attracting vermin, here
are some tips:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Wash the dishes and clean up spilled food from counters and
floors. Dispose of trash and clutter. Keep all food, water and
garbage in metal or thick plastic containers with tight-fitting
lids.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Thoroughly wash cans and bottles with soap and water before
putting them into recycling bins. Wash out the bins, too, because
what's left behind can attract rodents.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Keep storage areas free of litter and old newspapers. Rodents
are attracted to undisturbed areas within the house and in and
around stored objects.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Don't overload bird feeders; spilled seed attracts rodents.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Put out just enough pet food so your dog or cat can eat it all
at one time.

 &HT;    The high price of killing killers
 &HT;    By S.V. Date
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE _ What price for vengeance on society's worst
killers?
</P>
<P>
   In Florida, try $51 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   That, according to a Palm Beach Post estimate, is how much
Florida spends each year to enforce the death penalty _ above and
beyond what it would cost to punish all first-degree murderers with
life in prison without parole.
</P>
<P>
   And at the rate at which Florida is executing its killers (there
have been only 44 since executions resumed in 1979), it's costing
about $24 million per electrocuted murderer. ``That is an
astounding figure,'' said Mike McCarron, executive director of the
Florida Catholic Conference and, on behalf of the church, a
perennial death penalty opponent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's costing the state of Florida a small fortune,'' said
Elliott Metcalfe, president of the Florida Public Defenders
Association and the public defender in Sarasota and Manatee
counties.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is much cheaper to put these people in prison and leave
them there until they die. Simple as that.''
</P>
<P>
   According to The Post's estimate, it is about $23 million
cheaper, even for an inmate who is imprisoned in his 20s and dies
in his 70s.
</P>
<P>
   The Post's figure was derived using estimates of how much time
prosecutors and public defenders at the trial courts and the
Florida Supreme Court, which devotes approximately half its time to
death penalty cases, spend on the extra work needed in capital
cases. It accounts also for the time and effort expended on
defendants who are tried but convicted of a lesser murder charge
and whose death sentences are overturned on appeal as well as those
handful of condemned inmates who are actually executed. And while
the actual cost of prosecuting, convicting and executing an
individual killer in Florida has been estimated at about $3.2
million, some lawmakers contend the death penalty is worth whatever
it takes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you put a price on justice?'' asked Katie Baur,
spokeswoman for House Speaker John Thrasher. ``We have no qualms
about that whatsoever.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Locke Burt, R-Ormond Beach and a consistent supporter of
the death penalty, questioned The Post's analysis, saying he
thought it overestimated the amount of time and effort that
prosecutors and public defenders spent on the ``death'' portion of
death penalty cases at the trial level.
</P>
<P>
   He also pointed out that if the death penalty were eliminated
tomorrow, Florida would save only about $11 million a year _ the
cost of specialized lawyers hired exclusively to work on death
penalty appeals. Prosecutors, public defenders and the courts would
continue to cost just as much as before, although their workload
would shift to other cases that now get lower priority.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you didn't have the death penalty, how much money would you
save? The answer is not much,'' Burt said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Victor Crist, R-Temple Terrace and the House's main death
penalty aficionado in recent years, said he, too, doesn't care how
much it costs to speed up the death penalty process in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Texas can execute 25 a year, why can't Florida?'' he asked,
adding that he believes the appeals changes the legislature will
consider this week will, in coming years, make the process cheaper,
particularly as the state clears its Death Row backlog.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should be executing more people a year than we send to
Death Row, in order to catch up.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate staffers researching the issue came up with several
reasons why Texas has been executing inmates 10, even 20 times as
frequently:
</P>
<P>
   Judges in Texas and those on the federal appeals court that
covers Texas seem far more comfortable with the death penalty than
judges handling Florida's death cases.
</P>
<P>
   Texas spends a mere fraction per inmate that Florida does on
representation for condemned killers.
</P>
<P>
   Texas juries must agree by at least a 10-2 margin (Florida
merely requires a simple majority) for the death penalty, which
cuts down on appeals.
</P>
<P>
   But it's that ``let's-do-it-like-Texas'' attitude, said ACLU
lobbyist Larry Spalding, that illustrates why Florida will continue
to spend many times the cost of imprisoning murderers for life by
instead jumping through the expensive legal hoops to put them to
death.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is fiscally irresponsible to have the death penalty. So
what? People don't care,'' said Spalding, former chief of the state
agency that represents condemned murderers in their appeals.
</P>
<P>
   ``This really is a revenge issue. It's a political issue.''

   PESTICIDES _ WASHINGTON - Nobody collects reliable information
on how many chidren are exposed how often to toxic pesticides
sprayed in schools, according to auditors from the non-partisan
General Accounting. Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., who released
the GAO report Tuesday, called on the EPA to start drafting
regulations. But EPA officials told the GAO auditors that it would
require three more years of study to find out if the problem is big
enough to justify federal regulations. (Turay, Cox News Service).

   SWISS-RESCUE _ Matt Sanders spent almost a week on the side of a
Swiss mountain, with little more than Toblerone chocolate bars and
a sleeping bag to help him survive the subzero temperatures and 124
mph winds of one of Europe's fiercest storms. After three days,
rescuers presumed he had died. He survived five. Now the young
Austin man, who is recuperating at a hospital in Berne,
Switzerland, is soaking up worldwide attention, and doctors say
he'll make a full recovery. Monday morning, Miss Switzerland
dropped by his hospital room and made fresh guacamole and salsa.
His family, meanwhile, is trying to figure out how to pay the
several hundred thousand dollars it cost to send out helicopters to

   BARNES-RECORDS _ATLANTA _ Gov. Roy Barnes, widely lauded as a
champion of open government, says the state's public records law
doesn't apply to him. Barnes' staff says that the legislature
doesn't have the power to make the chief executive turn over
documents the way other officials have to do. The governor made
this assertion in turning down an AJC request to see his e-mails,
memos and other documents concerning his state budget proposal.
We'll get reaction from open-government advocates. (Judd, Atlanta

   FUNERAL _ AUSTIN, Texas _ The executive director of the Texas
Funeral Service Commission recently proposed requiring sellers of
funeral merchandise _ biggest item: caskets _ to get a state
funeral director's license. But members of the recently organized
Texas Association of Funeral Merchandise Retailers vehemently
object, saying the funeral home industry is just trying to protect
its monopoly. The retailers say they sell caskets for 50 percent
less than the funeral homes. (Hight/Wood, Austin

 &HT;    SENATOR CALLS FOR STRICTER RULES ON CLASSROOM PESTICIDES
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By ISMAIL TURAY JR.
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The government should require more information
about the amount of pesticides used at schools and how often
children are exposed to them, Sen. Joe Lieberman, D-Conn, said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was stunned to learn that while we have a national framework
in place for protecting workers from environmental and health
hazards on the job, we have no such framework for protecting
children from toxic substances in the classroom,'' Lieberman said
at a news conference. ``You don't have to be an A student to know
that is a double standard, one that deserves our singular
attention.''
</P>
<P>
   The General Accounting Office, which prepared a report at
Lieberman's request, found that pesticides are harmful to all human
beings, but children are at a greater risk. Per body weight,
children breathe more, eat more and have frequent hand-to-mouth
contact than adults, and pesticides are commonly sprayed on floors
and lawns where children play.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO said it documented 2,300 cases in which people were
exposed to pesticides in schools from 1993 to 1996. It found that
329 of those individuals needed medical attention. But the figures
are unreliable and incomplete because schools don't keep records of
the pesticides that they use, the GAO said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This information gap is troubling on a number of levels,''
said Lieberman, ranking member of the Governmental Affairs
Committee. ``So we have every right to be concerned, and every
incentive to take some action.''
</P>
<P>
   In a letter sent Tuesday, the senator urged the Environmental
Protection Agency to take immediate steps to remedy the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman asked the EPA to conduct a national statistical survey
on the use of pesticides in schools to determine if there are risks
``posed by pesticides to children through cumulative exposure.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Lieberman asked the EPA to require school officials
to notify parents before using pesticides in and around schools,
require that pesticides that are being used in school environment
be labeled appropriately, and provide guidance to pest control
companies and school districts on the risks of different
application methods.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA said it welcomed Tuesday's report. ``We will be taking
into consideration all of the recommendations,'' a spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement released by the Responsible Industry for a Sound
Environment, an organization that represents the pest control
industry, executive director Allen James said the industry shares
Lieberman's commitment to children's health.
</P>
<P>
   However, pests such as cockroaches, rats, mosquitos and wasps
can also be a threat to children and can transmit infectious
diseases, the group said.
</P>
<P>
   ``To protect children from such threats, schools must have all
the available pest control tools, including pesticides, at their
disposal,'' James said.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman said he is not trying to put the pest control industry
out of business, but ``we are just trying to protect our
children.''
</P>
<P>
   The EPA reported that seven states, including Texas, have
already taken initiatives to reduce the use of pesticides in
schools. Texas enacted the first law to mandate the use of
integrated pest management in schools in 1991, but the law didn't
become effective until 1995.

 &HT;    LastMinuteTravel.com takes to Super Bowl air waves
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ LastMinuteTravel.com's time has come, its founders
believe.
</P>
<P>
   The fledgling Atlanta-based Web site, which touts itself as a
clearinghouse of spur-of-the-moment travel offers, has fully
activated its site and launched a marketing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   It's even preparing a Super Bowl TV ad _ usually the province of
corporate titans, although this year as many as a dozen dot-coms
are expected to buy time. LastMinuteTravel's spot will air,
appropriately, during the last minute of the Jan. 30 game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not inexpensive, but the greatest advertising showcase in
terms of audience is the Super Bowl,'' said LastMinuteTravel.com
Chief Executive David Miranda.
</P>
<P>
   The theme of the company's Super Bowl ad is ``e-cowboys,''
Miranda said, but details are under wraps.
</P>
<P>
   Miranda launched the site last year, with financial and
technical backing from Atlanta's iXL Enterprises. Initially the
site was in ``sneak preview'' mode.
</P>
<P>
   To herald the recent switch to full speed, the company in
December ran full-page newspaper ads in USA Today and others.
</P>
<P>
   It also got some unintended _ but invaluable _ air time on radio
personality Don Imus' show. LastMinuteTravel's ad agency had
contacted Imus' agent about having the ``I-Man'' appear in the
Super Bowl spot. Part of his pay would be in the form of a donation
to a New Mexico ranch Imus started for ill children. After the deal
fell apart, Imus gigged the Web site by name on his show.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is we're still going to make a donation,''
LastMinuteTravel spokeswoman Gayle McIntyre said, adding that the
mere mention on Imus' show had raised the company's profile.
</P>
<P>
   Attracting attention is key to LastMinuteTravel's strategy as it
seeks to break through the clutter of travel-oriented Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   The company has added former Coca-Cola Co. marketing czar Sergio
Zyman to its board to help in the effort.
</P>
<P>
   LastMinuteTravel is designed as a ``stock exchange'' that brings
together short-notice travelers and suppliers looking to unload
unsold seats or vacancies.
</P>
<P>
   A dozen airlines, along with several hotel chains, cruise lines
and car rental companies, currently list on the site for a fee.
Visitors who want to book a trip are linked to the suppliers' own
site, which frees LastMinuteTravel from providing fulfillment.
</P>
<P>
   To date, Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines does not list at
LastMinuteTravel. But AirTran Airways, Atlanta's second-largest
airline, does.
</P>
<P>
   Miranda believes LastMinuteTravel.com's tight focus on
short-notice travelers sets it apart from the pack of travel Web
sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty simple. We're an e-mediary of just-released travel
offers, and we specialize only in that niche. If someone's planning
a trip a month from now, they'll use a traditional travel agent or
another online agent.''
</P>
<P>
   He said LastMinuteTravel's customers typically plan to travel
within 72 hours of visiting the site or within two weeks in the
case of cruise-takers and international travelers.
</P>
<P>
   Miranda also said the company may launch a public stock offering
in the first half of 2000.

 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton said Tuesday he would nominate
Alan Greenspan to a fourth four-year term as chairman of the
Federal Reserve.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made the announcement at the White House after meeting
in the Oval Office on Tuesday morning with Greenspan, whose
inflation-fighting efforts are widely credited with providing the
foundation for the long economic expansion and the record-setting
bull market on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan, a conservative Republican who was first appointed to
the post by President Reagan in 1987, has won support from across
the political spectrum for his deft touch in keeping the economy on
track. Members of both parties said there is no question that his
nomination will be approved by the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan, 73, has made no secret of his desire to stay on, and
Tuesday's news was a surprise only in that it came so far in
advance of the expiration of his term of June.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he had to persuade Greenspan to accept another term,
Clinton responded, ``No. I asked him and he said yes.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Fed chairman standing at his side, Clinton praised
Greenspan for his role in nurturing an expansion that next month
will become the longest in the nation's history, with all the
benefits it has brought in low unemployment, rising wages and
reduced welfare rolls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, wise leadership from the Fed has played a very large
role in our strong economy,'' Clinton said. ``That is why today I
am pleased to announce my decision to renominate Alan Greenspan as
chairman of the Federal Reserve Board.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said Greenspan's ``wise and steady leadership has
inspired confidence, not only here in America but all around the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan in turn warmly praised Clinton and his economic team,
with whom he has worked closely in overhauling the nation's banking
laws, containing the global financial crisis that rocked Asia
several years ago and monitoring the rapid changes that technology
has brought to the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan said he had enjoyed every minute of the job, and
suggested his enthusiasm for it was undiminished.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really been an extraordinary challenge, and especially
for an economist who likes to get into the nitty-gritty of every
statistic you've ever seen,'' Greenspan said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked by a reporter to comment on the stock market, Greenspan
reverted to his usual silence, declining to answer.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had dropped broad hints last year that he would like to
reappoint Greenspan. Vice President Al Gore has been a strong
backer of reappointing Greenspan, as have Gov. George W. Bush of
Texas, the front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination,
and his chief rival in the Republican primaries, Sen. John McCain
of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan's reappointment was also sure to be welcomed on Wall
Street, which at times has been exasperated by the Fed chairman's
suggestions that stock prices are overvalued but has profited
enormously from the climate of low inflation and steady growth that
he has helped to create.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton's announcement did little to help stocks Tuesday.
Prices fell sharply on Wall Street throughout the morning, in part
because of expectations that Greenspan would raise interest rates
next month to slow the economy and prevent a buildup of
inflationary pressures.
</P>
<P>
   By reappointing Greenspan well before his term expired, Clinton
seemed to be trying to stick to his administration's strategy of
insulating the Fed from politics as much as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan is all but certain to raise interest rates in coming
months, and might have to engineer a series of rate increases as
the election year progresses if the economy does not slow, analysts
said. And although Gore, Bush and McCain all support Greenspan, the
Fed chairman has come under criticism on the Republican side from
Steve Forbes, who says Greenspan is too quick to assume that strong
growth will generate inflation. And Greenspan has gotten only
lukewarm support from former Sen. Bill Bradley, Gore's chief rival
for the Democratic nomination.

   TECH-HELP-DESK (Undated) _ At a time when millions of
white-collar workers depend on a desktop computer to perform
virtually every function of their job, computer help-desk employees
are fast achieving a position once held by the office secretary. In
a subtle shift of workplace politics, they have become the people
whose affection smart colleagues are going to great lengths to win.
Indeed, as the number of secretaries has declined by about one
million, or 25 percent, over the last two decades, technology _ in
the form of voice mail and e-mail _ has taken over many of their
old tasks. So last month, as the gift-giving of the December
holidays has coincided with worries over year 2000 computer
problems, help-desk workers across the country have been bombarded
with homemade cookies, chocolate samplers, trinkets and thank-you
notes that are carbon-copied to top executives.

   The soprano Renee Fleming first performed the role of the
Marschallin in Strauss' opera ``Der Rosenkavalier'' in 1995 at the
Houston Grand Opera. For a first try at a touchstone role with an
imposing heritage of famous interpreters, Ms. Fleming's performance
was reportedly impressive. She performed it again in 1997 at the
Bastille Opera in Paris, with even greater confidence, depth and
eloquence. That performance was a critical triumph, and word
quickly spread that a remarkable new Marschallin had arrived among
us. She sang the Marschallin in Munich last year, and will bring
her portrayal to the Metropolitan Opera in New York for the first
time on Jan. 20.
</P>
<P>
   During the era of long-playing records, a major soprano in her
prime who enjoyed success in a role in the opera house was usually
ushered into a studio to document her portrayal on a recording of
the complete opera. Zinka Milanov, Renata Tebaldi, Maria Callas,
Joan Sutherland, Birgit Nilsson, Leontyne Price _ the important
singers of that era left accounts of virtually all of their
important roles, complete, and sometimes more than once.
</P>
<P>
   But Strauss fans who covet a complete recording of ``Der
Rosenkavalier'' with Ms. Fleming will have to content themselves
with her recent Decca release, ``Strauss Heroines,'' on which she
sings extended scenes from the opera with the mezzo-soprano Susan
Graham as Octavian and the soprano Barbara Bonney as Sophie, as
well as scenes from ``Arabella'' and ``Capriccio.'' Christoph
Eschenbach conducts the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons are longstanding. With the introduction of compact
discs, record companies began systematically reissuing their back
catalogs, and, as every classical collector knows, the market is
now glutted with choices. The costs of recording have risen as
well. To record a complete opera today can easily require $500,000,
depending upon the scope of the work, the amount of rehearsal time
required, the size of the orchestra and chorus and the locale of
the recording: musician's union rules can make recording an
orchestra in the United States twice as expensive as in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Make no mistake, the new recording is marvelous. Ms. Fleming is
captured in sumptuous voice. Her identity with Strauss' heroines is
palpable, hcianship is scrupulous and her understanding of
the style recalls the work of the most renowned exponent of these
roles, Elisabeth Schwarzkopf.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is not a complete recording of the opera. And the fact
that it exi is selling so well (consistently in the Top 10
of the Billboard classical charts) may even dissuade Decca, Ms.
Fleming's exclusive company, from undertaking a complete
``Rosenkavalier'' for her. One could argue that this is not
entirely a bad thing. After all, do we really need another complete
recording of this opera when 15 others are currently available,
including some of great historical importance? And Ms. Fleming's
recording of selected scenes may wind up reaching more people than
a complete ``Rosenkavalier'' ever would. But the history of Strauss
opera performances will have a gap.
</P>
<P>
   That a change in the business of recording operas is under way
is also clear from recent recordings of Deborah Voigt and Ruth Ann
Swenson. Both discs, though valuable additions to the catalog,
serve as a reminder that these important sopranos are also
underrepresented on complete opera recordings. The situation is not
likely to change.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fleming has carefully devised her program on ``Strauss
Heroines,'' offering some 40 minutes of excerpts from ``Der
Rosenkavalier,'' including most of the important music for the
Marschallin. She begins with the character's touching monologue in
Act I, which leads, as in the opera, to the extended scene between
the Marschallin, a princess in Austria during the reign of
Marie-Therese, and Octavian, the 17-year-old count with whom she is
having an affair.
</P>
<P>
   Also included, of course, is the whole last scene of the opera,
from the great Act III trio with the Marschallin, Octavian and
Sophie, the perky, young woman who enchants Octavian at first
sight, through the final duet for the love-struck adolescents.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Graham, Ms. Bonney and Ms. Fleming performed the opera
together in Paris, and their ease with each other comes through.
During the recording sessions Ms. Graham and Ms. Bonney playfully
called themselves ``The Flemettes.'' By including extended excerpts
for Octavian and Sophie on her recording, Ms. Fleming is able to
perform the Marschallin's music in its proper dramatic context. The
result is like a mini-version of the entire opera.
</P>
<P>
   The single excerpt from ``Arabella'' is the long duet between
the title character, sung by Ms. Fleming, and her tomboy younger
sister, sung by Ms. Graham. The countess' great closing scene from
``Capriccio'' concludes Ms. Fleming's program. In a touching nod to
the past, the recording presents the long-retired bass Walter
Berry, a famous Baron Ochs in ``Der Rosenkavalier,'' singing the
few lines of Faninal in the closing moments of that opera, as well
as the Major Domo's couple of lines in ``Capriccio.''
</P>
<P>
   In the ``Rosenkavalier'' scenes, Ms. Graham, who will sing
Octavian in the coming Met performances, and Ms. Bonney sing
beautifully. Ms. Fleming is incomparable. Her warm, lyric soprano
sound has an uncanny mix of youthful bloom and worldly-wise
resignation. It's hard to hear her honest, poignant account of the
Marschallin's monologue without feeling that you are almost spying
on someone's private sadness.
</P>
<P>
   Her ``Arabella'' and ``Capriccio'' excerpts are equally
splendid. Eschenbach, who conducted Ms. Fleming's first stage
performances of ``Arabella'' and ``Der Rosenkavalier'' as well as
her first concert performance of the closing scene from
``Capriccio,'' paces the music with sensitivity and suppleness,
drawing wondrous colors and textures from the Vienna Philharmonic.
</P>
<P>
   A recent Teldec recording offers Ms. Voigt in Strauss' ``Four
Last Songs,'' with Kurt Masur conducting the New York Philharmonic.
This magnificent dramatic soprano has recorded several complete
roles, including a memorable Chrysothemis in Strauss' ``Elektra,''
also on Teldec, but she not yet recorded those for which she has
won her greatest acclaim, Wagner's Sieglinde and Strauss' Ariadne,
though plans are apparently under way for a Deutsche Grammophon
recording of the latter.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   If she does not do so soon it will be a great loss, for Ms.
Voigt is in her vocal prime, as the new recording of ``Four Last
Songs'' indicates. Her singing is rich, opulent, incisive and full
of color. Masur conducts a spacious performance. The record
includes two Strauss orchestral tone poems: ``Don Juan'' and ``Tod
und Verklarung.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Swenson's disc, ``Endless Pleasure,'' a program of Mozart
and Handel arias, is her third for EMI Classics. A fourth, ``Con
Amore,'' offering Italian arias, is due out this month. ``Endless
Pleasure'' is a lovely recording. Sir Charles Mackerras conducts
the period-instrument Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment with
vibrancy and stylistic authority. Ms. Swenson's accounts of arias
from Handel's ``Giulio Cesare'' and ``Semele'' are lyrically
beguiling and brilliant. In Mozart's ``Martern aller Arten,'' from
``Die Entfuehrung aus dem Serail,'' she navigates the daunting
coloratura flights with effortless agility and no loss of sheer
tonal beauty.
</P>
<P>
   But her admirers will have to wait and hope to hear her in
complete opera recordings. So far she has been heard only on two:
as Juliette in Gounod's ``Romeo et Juliette,'' on the BMG Classics
label, and, for EMI, as Puccini's Musetta in ``La Boheme,'' a role
she has not sung prominently on stage. She has yet to record the
Bellini heroines she sings so lovingly. Nor has she yet recorded
her most praised portrayal, Gilda in Verdi's ``Rigoletto.''
</P>
<P>
   It must be said again that the cutback in the recording of
complete operas is in some ways understandable. We need recordings
of new music and neglected works much more than another complete
``Rigoletto.'' Ms. Fleming's last complete recording for Decca was
of a less familiar work, Dvorak's ``Rusalka.'' The title role is
one of her favorites. The recording was critically hailed and has
sold well. It clearly serves a need. Record companies reasonably
question whether opera fans will buy, say, a new recording of
Bellini's ``Sonnambula'' with Ms. Swenson in the title role when
they already have classic Sutherland and Callas versions to chose
from.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the legacy of opera will be sadly incomplete if the
important singers of our day do not get to leave accounts of the
roles that have been central to their work. One solution is to
issue more recordings of live performances, which are cheaper to
produce, like Solti's 1996 Decca release of Mozart's ``Cosi Fan
Tutte,'' with Ms. Fleming as Fiordiligi.
</P>
<P>
   In a new trend, companies are seeking corporate sponsors for
individual opera recordings. Deutsche Grammophon's important
release of Rameau's ``Hippolyte et Aricie'' was underwritten by
J.P. Morgan. Record company executives are trying to convince
corporations that sponsoring a recording of an opera is potentially
more important and lasting than financing a stage production
somewhere, an argument that must scare the wits out of opera
company managers.
</P>
<P>
   This financial approach probably won't catch on. The status quo
seems likely to continue: recordings of complete operas will be
made less frequently, and we will all have to adjust.
</P>
<P>
   But it represents a big change from the days when Renata Tebaldi
just assumed that once she sang a role in the opera house, a studio
recording would follow.

 &HT;    Out of options, Mississippi's Musgrove wins governorship
 &HT;    By Anne Rochell Konigsmark
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSON, Miss. _ Democrat Ronnie Musgrove will be Mississippi's
next governor, thanks to a historic vote Tuesday in the state House
of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   The Nov. 2 general election left neither Musgrove, 43, who is
lieutenant governor, nor Mike Parker, 50, a Republican and former
congressman, with more than 50 percent of the votes. Musgrove got
8,000 more votes than Parker, but because of two lesser known
candidates, neither won a majority. And Parker and Musgrove tied in
electoral votes, based on who got the most votes in each state
House voting district.
</P>
<P>
   The state constitution dictates such a close race be decided by
the House. About 70 percent of the Democrat-dominated body voted
for Musgrove. The vote was 86 to 36, with two Republicans voting
for Musgrove and two Democrats voting for Parker. It was the first
time in Mississippi history that the House had to decide a
governor's race.
</P>
<P>
   ``We simply say thank you,'' Musgrove said in a press conference
on the main floor of the Capitol following the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Parker held a press conference on the bottom floor of Jackson's
historic Capitol. Just before he arrived, a maintenance crew
switched the podium he would use from one with a state seal to one
without one. Musgrove spoke from the podium with the seal, and was
flanked by the American and state flags.
</P>
<P>
   Parker called Musgrove immediately after the vote to
congratulate him, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The House of Representatives has spoken, and the process hlowed its course,'' he said. Asked if he approves of the
process, he said he did not.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the constitution should be changed,'' he said. ``I
would like to see a tie settled with a runoff. The people should
make the decision, not the House.''
</P>
<P>
   Musgrove also said he thinks the constitution should be changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe the people of the state feel and believe the person
who has the highest number of votes should win,'' he said. ``I'm
sure the people of the House and Senate will address that issue.''
</P>
<P>
   House members did not necessarily vote with their districts.
State Rep. Bobby Moak, a Democrat from Parker's home county of
Lincoln, said he voted for Musgrove, even though his district voted
for Parker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to take that into consideration, but I am not bound by
that,'' he said. ``I couldn't get past the fact that Musgrove won
the popular vote statewide. He got more votes and I find it hard to
overcome that.''
</P>
<P>
   Musgrove will succeed Gov. Kirk Fordice, who has served two
terms and was the first Republican governor of Mississippi since
Reconstruction. His terms were marked by personal scandal: His
longtime affair with a childhood sweetheart made headlines several
times. He went public with the affair, and his intention to divorce
his wife, ar. He was barred from seeking a third term by a
term limits provision in the state constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Musgrove has less than a week to plan an inaugural celebration
and take over as governor.

ITALY TO OPEN DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH NORTH KOREA 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ To help end North Korea's isolation, Italy announced
Tuesday that it was opening diplomatic relations with the hard-line
Communist nation, the first large industrial country to do so.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement marked a significant shift in North Korea's
relationship with the rest of the world. North Korea, sometimes
known as the ``hermit nation,'' has long held out complete
self-reliance as part of its state ideology. But natural disasters
and the failure of its collective farming policy in recent years
caused widespread famine, forcing the government to accept foreign
aid and some kind of relationship with the West. Last month, Japan
lifted sanctions against North Korea, a step that was seen as a
preparatory step for normalizing relations.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's announcement took North Korea a full step further.
</P>
<P>
   ``This happened as a conjunction of the West's need to end North
Korea's dangerous isolation, and North Korea's need to feed
itself,'' an Italian Foreign Ministry official, who asked not to be
identified, explained.
</P>
<P>
   The Italian government is not, however, the first European
country to open diplomatic relations with North Korea. Sweden,
Denmark, Finland, Austria and Portugal have taken the step. But
Italy is the first member of the Group of 7 inustrial nations to
and took the lead among them almost as a point of foreign
policy pride.
</P>
<P>
   ``Italy can and does serve as an icebreaker in international
affairs,'' the Italian official said. ``It's the Dini doctrine.''
He was referring to Lamberto Dini, Italy's foreign minister, who
recently brokered reconciliation pacts with two other rogue
nations, Iran and Libya. Italy had strong economic ties to those
two countries, which have rich oil resources. So far, at least,
Rome has negligible trade with North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   James Rubin, the State Department spokesman, responded Tuesday
by saying, ``Our view has been that each country has to make its
own decision on how to proceed toward a more normal relationship
with North Korea, as North Korea meets the international
community's concerns on the nuclear and the missile front.''
</P>
<P>
   Italian government officials said that they had informed the
United States and South Korea of their overtures to the North
Koreans in advance, and that they received full support. ``The West
realizes that an isolated North Korea, with its nuclear potential
and missile technology, poses a real risk,'' the Foreign Ministry
official said.
</P>
<P>
   He said that Dini had discussed his overtures with Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright during a conference in Florence in
October. He raised it with his South Korean counterpart at a
gathering in Istanbul, Turkey, in November. ``Italy has been trying
to bring North Korea back to ordinary business for some time,'' the
Foreign Ministry official said. ``But it is not an isolated policy.
It is a widely shared strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   Dini met Tuesday with Kim Hung Rim, North Korea's representative
to the Food and Agriculture Organization, a U.N. agency based in
Rome. After the meeting, Kim told Reuters, ``We will do all that is
possible to develop and intensify bilateral relations and
cooperation and exchanges in the international community.''
</P>
<P>
   He said a decision on whether the North Korean mission to the
Food and Agriculture Organization could be upgraded to embassy
status would be made ``as soon as possible.'' The Italian Foreign
Ministry said it would use its Beijing mission as a conduit for
relations with North Korea.

   &QL;  Businesses must apply ergonomics for at-home workers
</P>
<P>
   OSHA advisory reminds businesses that the country's 19.6 million
telecommuters have to be protected
</P>
<P>
   By Tania Anderson
</P>
<P>
   States News Service
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Jan. 4 -- Small business advocates were buzzing
Tuesday over the surprise discovery of existing federal laws that
require businesses to apply ergonomics standards to home offices.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery of the Occupational Safety &AMP; Health
Administration's requirement came after a Texas businessman wrote
the federal agency in August 1997 requesting information on how to
set up home offices for some sales executives. The agency responded
more than two years later with a five-page letter in November 1999
that described OSHA's safety requirements for home offices.
</P>
<P>
   Although OSHA posted the advisory publicly on its website on
Nov. 15 of last year, national attention focused on the issue
Tuesday following a front page Washington Post story.
</P>
<P>
   Employers are responsible for making sure that any employee
working at home has furniture, such as chairs and computer tables,
that will prevent work-related muscle and joint problems such as
carpal tunnel syndrome. The employee must also have proper
lighting, heating, cooling and ventilation systems in their home
office.
</P>
<P>
   Employers also must identify in advance possible hazards in home
offices and provide any necessary protection through training,
personal protective equipment, or other measures needed to reduce
or eliminate the hazard.
</P>
<P>
   Small business advocates expressed shock at news of the advisory
on Tuesday, two months after OSHA posted the advisory. Advocates
said it could hurt small businesses by discouraging them from
offering telecommuting options and cost them millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will effectively ban all telecommuting and working at home
because employers can't afford the risk if something goes wrong in
a person's home,'' said Chris Wysocki, president of the Small
Business Survival Committee.
</P>
<P>
   A survey of the National Small Business United's 65,000 members
in Fall 1998 revealed that at least one in five companies allowed
employees to telecommute. Todd McCracken, president of the NSBU,
said he expects that number is now closer to one in three
companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very common with small businesses because it allows
people to accommodate family needs. This is going to discourage
that,'' McCracken said. ``There will be a growing tension with
employees and employers.''
</P>
<P>
   Labor Secretary Alexis M. Herman Tuesday called for a national
dialog on determining rules and policies for home offices.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the virtual workplace, where the door never closes, the
rules are not so clear,'' Herman said. ``We need a process where we
can sit down with stakeholders, including employers and employees,
to determine the best way to ensure the safety and health of
America's workers now and in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   The discovery of OSHA's requirement comes weeks after the agency
announced an ergonomics standards proposal that was also sharply
criticized by small business advocates. The new guidelines may
require employers to provide work spaces and equipment that will
allow each individual to do his or her job regardless of physical
makeup. Estimates of the cost of this proposal to small businesses
ranges between $4 billion and $100 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The National Federal of Independent Business said OSHA's
standards for home offices could cost employers ``untold millions
of dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just one more example of how far overboard OSHA
frequently goes,'' said Dan Danner, NFIB's senior vice president.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Chamber of Commerce also denounced OSHA's requirement
and called it ``government regulation run amok.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's outrageous,'' said Bruce Josten, the Chamber's executive
vice president. ``This runs completely counter to employers'
efforts to give workers greater flexibility and counter to the
administration's own emphasis on families.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials with the Small Business Administration's Advocacy
Office, which operates independently of the Clinton
administration's policies, were doing research on the requirement
and did not have a response Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Frank Wolf, R-Va., who has authored legislation that
encourages telecommuting, was surprised to learn of the OSHA
regulations, according to Roseanne Dupras, his spokesperson.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf's legislation, which was signed into law last October,
seeks to expand telecommuting and gives workers greater flexibility
and the option of working at home. The law includes a $350,000
grant to the Department of Transportation, the Environmental
Protection Agency and the Department of Energy to work with state
and local governments and local business organizations and leaders
to develop a regional telecommuting pilot program.
</P>
<P>
   Dupras said it was odd that President Clinton would sign this
initiative into law, and that his administration would reveal
regulations that seem to discourage telecommuting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like the right hand not knowing what the left hand is
doing,'' Dupras said.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf, who chairs the House Transportation Appropriations
Subcommittee, is holding a press conference Wednesday with the
American Automobile Association to discuss the potential impact of
the OSHA regulations.

RECALLING INDIA HIJACKING, PILOT SAYS NEGOTIATIONS WERE VITAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By CELIA W. DUGGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ The hijackers, jumpy and brusque, shoved the
nose of the gun to the pilot's head. Take off in 30 seconds or die,
they told him. Then they began a panicky countdown: ``30, 29, 28,
27 ... .'' When they reached 2, Capt. Devi Sharan opened up the
power on Indian Airlines flight 814 and took off.
</P>
<P>
   As the Airbus lifted into the sky at 7:49 p.m. on Christmas Eve,
any possibility that a crack Indian commando team could storm the
plane and try to rescue the 184 passengers and crew members ended.
The jet was leaving Amritsar, in India, and heading across the
border into what many Indians consider enemy territory: Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   More than any other moment in the eight-day hijacking drama on
the plane scheduled to fly from Nepal to New Delhi, this is the one
that has come back to haunt the Indian government.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition leaders ask how officials could have failed to block
the plane during the hour it sat on a runway in Amritsar, the first
place it landed after the hijackers revealed themselves. How, they
ask, could India have let the hijackers escape to Pakistan and then
Afghanistan _ countries seen as hostile, countries where India had
little choice but humiliating negotiations with the hijackers?
</P>
<P>
   Sharan, 37, the commander of the plane, spoke about that issue
and others raised about the hijacking during an interview Tuesday
in his modest home in New Delhi. He said he believed that 70 or 80
_ perhaps 100 _ passengers would have died at the hands of the
grenade-toting hijackers if there had been a commando raid to try
to end the episode.
</P>
<P>
   The only hope for a peaceful solution lay in negotiations, he
said, and the hijackers were too nervous and too desperate to get
out of India to have conducted them during that first night of the
crisis in Amritsar.
</P>
<P>
   By the time they put a gun to his head, he said, he saw no
option but to put the plane in the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'd already cut the necks of two people,'' he said, one of
whom died. ``I was scared _ scared they can kill anybody,
everybody. I had to take off. I had no choice. They would have
blown my head off. And if I was killed, they would have opened all
the hand grenades and blown up the airplane.''
</P>
<P>
   Passengers interviewed since the crisis ended on New Year's Eve,
with a swap of all of the hostages for three imprisoned militants,
said Sharan's ebullient personality and calm, level-headed style
had helped to hold them together during the eight traumatic days of
captivity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The captain saved us,'' said K. Keshav Kannan, a businessman
who lives in the north Indian state of Uttar Pradesh.
</P>
<P>
   When the released hostages flew home to India, pouring out of
the New Delhi airport and into the arms of their families, Sharan,
his face covered in a stubble of beard, was hoisted onto the
shoulders of his crew and hailed as a hero by the passengers.
</P>
<P>
   In the days since, he has become a minor celebrity here, his
photograph splashed across the front pages of the major newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have talked to ABC, CNBC, CBS or CSB _ I don't remember the
names,'' he said. ``But I've talked to a lot of American television
stations. I have given two or three interviews to Radio Tehran!''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Sharan, who grew up the youngest son of a small farmer in a tiny
village in the state of Haryana, has welcomed the stream of
well-wishers and journalists who have come to his home in the
Indian Airlines colony here, the dingy housing complex where pilots
working for India's national carrier live.
</P>
<P>
   His small two-bedroom apartment was decked with bouquets of
flowers. And his daughters, 10 and 7, passed a tray of almonds and
sweets as their father narrated for the umpteenth time, yet with
verve, the events that had unfolded inside the plane.
</P>
<P>
   He talked about the moments of drama: of nearly crash-landing
the plane on a road in Lahore, Pakistan, then lifting up at the
last moment when he saw 100 to 200 people standing on it; of
getting permission to land on the Lahore runway with only seconds
of fuel to spare; of quietly spreading the word among the
passengers about how to open the plane's doors if the hijackers
began killing them; of the morning when the hijackers said they
would begin shooting the hostages, one by one.
</P>
<P>
   He also discussed his suspicions that the Taliban, the Islamic
fundamentalist rulers of most of Afghanistan, might have enabled
the hijackers to gain access to more guns and grenades once the
plane landed in the Afghan city of Kandahar.
</P>
<P>
   The hijackers told him that they had a bag or two in the cargo
hold, he said. The captain said the Taliban might have opened the
hold for the hijackers _ a job that requires a special instrument,
he said _ so they could get their baggage.
</P>
<P>
   He also talked about the strange, closed world of the plane.
Like the hostages, he recalled the hijacker called Burger as the
one who ``won the hearts of the people'' by leading them in song
and joke-telling and by chatting companionably with them. The
captain, too, joined in the games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to make the best of that time, so that nobody
should be nervous and think the world is finished now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, he conceded, he told a few airplane jokes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like one guy was traveling with a parrot,'' he said. ``See, an
air hostess comes, so the parrot kisses her. OK? The master of that
parrot thinks I can also do that. He also kisses her. The commander
comes out and asks, `Why did you do this?' The master says,
`Because my parrot did that.' So the commander decided to throw
them both out of the plane, the parrot and the master. They opened
the door. The parrot asks his master, `Can you fly?'''
</P>
<P>
   The captain's family, sitting in their cozy living room, laughed
uproariously at his black humor, just as the hostages had.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever the hijackers laughed, we laughed,'' the captain said
seriously. ``Whenever they were tense, we were tense.''
</P>
<P>
   But the captain, an optimistic, sunny man, seemed anything but
tense on Tuesday. He has shaken hands with the prime minister and
taken calls of congratulations from the most powerful ministers in
the Indian government.
</P>
<P>
   When his employer, Indian Airlines, called on Tuesday to say
they needed him to fly on Tuesday night, he told them he was busy
giving interviews but could fly out the next morning. He is eager
to get back in the cockpit, and he said, ``I am ready to face
another hijack also.''

COMEBACKS AND NEWCOMERS WIN NOMINATIONS FOR GRAMMY AWARDS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By NEIL STRAUSS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 30 years of making music, the group Santana has never
received a Grammy Award for its work. That seems likely to change
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Nominations for the 42nd Annual Grammy Awards were announced
Tuesday by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences at
the Beverly Hilton Hotel, in Beverly Hills, Calif., and Santana led
the pack with 10 nominations _ four more than any other act. Behind
the group, whose leader, Carlos Santana, won a Grammy in 1998 for
best rock instrumental, were TLC and Pierre Boulez with six
nominations, Asleep at the Wheel with five, and, with four each,
the Backstreet Boys, the Dixie Chicks, Emmylou Harris, Whitney
Houston and last year's big winner, Lauryn Hill.
</P>
<P>
   The awards will be presented in a ceremony on Feb. 23 at the
Staples Center Arena in Los Angeles and broadcast on CBS.
</P>
<P>
   Santana, whose comeback record ``Supernatural'' has sold over
four million copies, will be competing in all three of the night's
top categories with two much newer acts: TLC and Ricky Martin.
Nominated for record of the year (an award given to a single) is
``Smooth'' by Santana featuring Rob Thomas, ``I Want It That Way''
by the Backstreet Boys and ``No Scrubs'' by TLC. Also in the
running is another 1999 comeback that rivals Santana's: ``Believe''
by Cher. And the final nomination in the category went to ``Livin'
la Vida Loca,'' the song by Ricky Martin that catapulted to
national success after he performed it on the Grammy telecast last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Competing for album of the year are ``Supernatural,''
``Millennium'' by the Backstreet Boys and ``Fanmail'' by TLC as
well as ``Fly'' by the Dixie Chicks and ``When I Look in Your
Eyes'' by Diana Krall. And for song of the year (which recognizes
songwriters), ``Smooth,'' ``I Want It That Way'' and ``Livin' la
Vida Loca'' are joined by the TLC ballad ``Unpretty'' and ``You've
Got a Way'' with Shania Twain.
</P>
<P>
   An odd mix of performers are in the running for best new artist,
with the helium-voiced soul diva Macy Gray, the rapping metalhead
Kid Rock, the blues singer and guitarist Susan Tedeschi and the
teeny-bop popsters Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera.
</P>
<P>
   It was a Grammy type of year in the pop world with little
excitement or innovation, and the nominees for the most part
reflect this. One of the only fresh trends in the pop charts was
Latin and Latin-tinged music. This can be seen not just in the
success of Santana in the nominations but also in categories like
best male pop vocal performance, for which three of the five
selections are by Latin acts or use Latin rhythms (including
Martin, Lou Bega and Marc Anthony).
</P>
<P>
   In other fields Busta Rhymes and Eminem were nominated in every
rap category. In jazz, nominations took odd turns, with two
vibraphonists (Gary Burton and Stefon Harris) in the running for
best instrumental solo and Tim Hagans' self-conscious album of
electronic dance fusion nominated for best contemporary
performance.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Santana, other acts that stand to receive their first
Grammy include Barry White, Wilson Pickett, Black Sabbath, Fatboy
Slim, Ani DiFranco, Moby and Motorhead.
</P>
<P>
   Only recordings released between Oct. 1, 1998, and Sept. 30,
1999, were eligible for the nominations, which were selected by the
10,000 voting members of the National Academy of Recording Arts and
Sciences.

`FEISTY' BUSH COMPARES McCAIN TO GORE 
 
By R.G. RATCLIFFE 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEDFORD, N.H. _ Presidential hopeful George W. Bush kept his New
Year's resolution to be more ``feisty'' in his campaign by
aggressively criticizing rival John McCain on Tuesday, likening him
to Democratic front-runner Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said there was a ``tax gap'' between him and McCain. The
Texas governor said his plan would offer major tax breaks to the
middle class and the working poor while McCain's does not.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a big difference of attitude, a big difference of
opinion,'' Bush said. ``He called my plan too big _ so has Vice
President Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also Tuesday won the endorsement of former rival Elizabeth
Dole, who likened Bush to a GOP icon, former President Ronald
Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   McCain and his aides said Bush's tax plan risked the viability
of Social Security while spending all the federal budget surplus
and added that McCain will lay out a full tax plan that preserves
Social Security next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   While Bush has maintained a lead for the Republican presidential
nomination nationally, McCain now leads in several polls in New
Hampshire. Bush promised last month to regain the lead by being
more direct in engaging McCain in a policy debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a feisty side of me that you haven't seen yet,'' Bush
told the Boston Globe.
</P>
<P>
   Arriving late Monday in New Hampshire, Bush said a similar
``gap'' exists between himself and McCain on campaign finance
reform. Bush favors eliminating soft money contributions to
political parties from unions and corporations but not from
individuals; McCain wants to ban soft money entirely.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush said McCain's plan does not go far enough in
eliminating the use of union dues money for political purposes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a labor gap when it comes to campaign funding
reform,'' Bush said. ``The plan that (Democratic candidate Bill)
Bradley and Gore and McCain propose would hurt the Republican
Party. And I'm not going to let that happen. I'm not going to
unilaterally disarm.''
</P>
<P>
   But McCain's plan, like Bush's, includes a provision known by
Republicans as ``paycheck protection,'' which requires that union
members and stockholders give approval before any of their dues or
other money is spent for any political purpose.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obviously a sign of our organization's strength if he
(Bush) is going to attack us on campaign finance, an issue that two
months ago he said voters don't care about,'' said McCain spokesman
Howard Opinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said his tax plan will help the middle class by increasing
the child tax credit from $500 to $1,000 a year, and it will help
the working poor by reducing the lowest tax rate from 15 percent to
10 percent. McCain has proposed keeping the lowest tax rate at 15
percent and the child tax credit at $500.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said that under his plan, a family of four earning $50,000
would get a $2,000 tax break, while the same family would only get
a $200 break under McCain's plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe my plan is not only just right but that it can get
done,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer said that in 1997, McCain, a
senator from Arizona, voted to raise the retirement age for Social
Security from age 65 to 67, but that in an Iowa debate last month,
McCain said he opposes such an increase in the retirement age.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to me that straight talk is now going around in
circles,'' Fleischer said, playing off McCain's theme that he is a
``straight-talking'' politician.
</P>
<P>
   Fleischer said voters will hear Bush talk a great deal about the
``gaps'' between his policies and those of McCain between now and
the Feb. 1 New Hampshire primary.
</P>
<P>
   Dole appeared to join in the McCain critique during her
appearances to endorse Bush. In noting Bush's overwhelming
re-election victory last year, Dole said Bush had gained the
support of women, Hispanics and a sizeable number of black and
Democratic voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``In other words, those who know him best admire him most,''
Dole said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has had to fend off questions about why he is not better
liked in his home state of Arizona, where a number of officials,
including Gov. Jane Hull, are backing Bush. In one recent debate,
McCain was asked why those who knew him the best seemed to like him
the least.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether Bush was trying to link McCain's policies to those
of Gore, Fleischer said, ``The governor has a good ear for what
people say.''
</P>
<P>
   Dole declined to talk about McCain during the news conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``I support Governor Bush not only because I think he can win,
but because I know he can lead,'' Dole said.
</P>
<P>
   Dole and Bush said they believe her campaign for president
energized female voters, and Bush said he hopes her endorsement
will help lure them to vote for him.
</P>
<P>
   Dole and Bush said it is premature to talk about her as a
potential running mate. They also danced around questions about
whether there was any past hostility from the 1988 election in
which Bush's father defeated Dole's husband, former Sen. Bob Dole,
for the Republican presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wait a minute, that's ancient history,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Dole declined to say specifically whether her husband, the
former Senate Republican leader, agreed with her decision to
endorse Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob was very pleased and very positive about my decision. He
respects my decision,'' Dole said.

THE WRITER TO BE AND HIS MENTOR: SUPPORT IN A DISLOCATED WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MEL GUSSOW   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ V.S. Naipaul has a new book, ``Between Father and Son:
Family Letters,'' and, in what may be a first for an author, he has
not read it, and, at least for the present, he has no intention of
reading it. As he explained in a recent interview here, the reason
he is maintaining such a distance from the book is personal rather
than critical.
</P>
<P>
   The book, being this month by Alfred A. Knopf, is a collection
of letters between Naipaul and his father, Seepersad Naipaul (with
some to his older sister, Kamla, and other family members). Almost
all were written during the early 1950s after the younger Naipaul
had left his home in Trinidad and was studying at Oxford
University. He had not yet embarked on his literary career. The
letters, which are in the author's archive at the University of
Tulsa in Oklahoma, were edited by Naipaul's agent, Gillon Aitken,
with his consent but without his participation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't ever want to relive those years,'' Naipaul said.
``They were too wretched.'' For him, it was a period of ``double
dislocation'' and ``double destitution.'' A young man of Indian
descent born in Trinidad, he was newly arrived in England, in need
of money and determined to become a writer, but with nothing to
demonstrate that he could fulfill that ambition.
</P>
<P>
   He permitted publication of the letters, he said, because ``in
addition to what they say about our family circumstances, they are
a cultural record of an immigrant community moving into a new world
over a couple of generations.'' They also serve as a kind of
memoir, showing the evolution of an artist transplanted into an
alien environment. It was only in England that he began to discover
himself as a writer.
</P>
<P>
   Looking back at that period, Naipaul, who is 67, said: ``My own
state of mind in 1952 was pretty bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a long time my heart was so full of love for the members
of my family. That kept me going, but it was a kind of wound as
well because I could do nothing for them.'' The letters, he said,
were irregular: ``They give an illusion of continuity where the
reality is full of emotional upheaval.'' As he talked, it was clear
that he remembered the basic content of the letters and how
important they were to him.
</P>
<P>
   The core of the correspondence is the relationship between
father and son. Seepersad Naipaul was a writer, working for a time
as a journalist in Trinidad and also writing short stories. At one
point, his father suggested that they do a book together, to be
called ``Letters Between a Father and Son.''
</P>
<P>
   Each encouraged the other's writing. In 1950 Seepersad Naipaul
wrote to his son, with no justification except his paternal
fidelity, ``I have no doubt whatever that you will be a great
writer.'' On the other hand, the son was torn by crosscurrents of
confidence and insecurity, writing to his older sister, ``I am
going to be either a big success or an unheard-of failure.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought somehow the gift was going to descend down to me,''
he said. ``Then I discovered I had to work at it.'' The letters
offer proof that despite his own doubts, the younger Naipaul always
possessed creative talent and that his father, though unrecognized,
was himself a perceptive writer _ and mentor.
</P>
<P>
   With an intellectual acuity that belied the limits of his
education, his father frequently gave him advice on writing. For
example, he said that if you say exactly what you want to say,
``you will have achieved style.'' When that passage was mentioned
to him, Naipaul agreed with his father: ``In my own practice, I
always avoided style. To me, it is simply getting at what you mean,
and that takes a lot of refining, because words can be deceptive.''
The elder Naipaul also admonished him to ``keep your center,'' an
idea that was to echo through his son's work.
</P>
<P>
   About his father's stories, he said: ``If they had contained an
element of untruth, I would not have cared for them. I think they
mattered to me because they gave me this picture of our community.
Without that picture, I would not have known who we were. One was
already in a historical void in a place like Trinidad.''
</P>
<P>
   His father was not an active part of his life until the boy was
6 or 7. As one of a large family, he was boarded out and lived in
his grandmother's house during his childhood. When they began
seeing each other regularly, the father would read his stories
aloud, and ``they acquired an element of the fairy tale.'' The
son's wish to write came from his reading, mostly of English
authors (Shakespeare and Dickens), and from the model of his
father. As Naipaul wrote in his recent essay, ``Reading and
Writing,'' it was ``less a true ambition than a form of
self-esteem, a dream of release, an idea of nobility.''
</P>
<P>
   The letters deal passingly _ and often comically _ with his days
at Oxford, for example, with his brief attempt to be a coxswain on
a rowing crew. Such events made him aware of things he could not
do: ``The nature of one's life meant that one wrote in a funny way
about things that were not funny in real life.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   At 18 he wrote his first novel, ``The Shadow'd Livery.'' ``It
was,'' he said, ``heavily dependent on Evelyn Waugh, but the idea
was my own _ a kind of farce on an important subject,'' a black man
in Trinidad who tries to turn himself into a king. After the book
was rejected by a publisher, it was jettisoned. He sank into a
depression that lasted about a year. Then he wrote a second novel,
a ``more personal, foolish book'' _ also unpublished.
</P>
<P>
   In October 1953 his father died (at 47) in Trinidad. Partly
because he was short of money, Naipaul did not return home for the
funeral. Somehow, despite his love for his father, the death acted
as a release. Less than two years later, he began writing with a
new seriousness of purpose and a clearer point of identity.
</P>
<P>
   The breakthrough came suddenly, while he was writing the stories
that later appeared in his book ``Miguel Street.'' From his
perspective, those early stories got better and better: ``There was
a moment, almost an hour, in which I began to be a writer. Somehow
I found the right tone, and the tone released the material, and it
all came together, and I could see my way ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   In quick succession he wrote ``Miguel Street'' and the novel
``The Mystic Masseur.'' Both were accepted for publication, and he
sent a cable home with the news. In 1956 he returned to Trinidad
for the first time _ and it was not a happy homecoming.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a tormenting time for me,'' he said. Nothing had yet
been published. ``The family situation was desperate. I was
unhappy, hour by hour.'' After returning to England, he began
writing ``A House for Biswas,'' his first masterpiece (published in
1961), and ``a lot of the emotional charge of that book'' came from
that visit to Trinidad.
</P>
<P>
   Many years earlier his father had suggested that he use him as a
character in his fiction. ``I remember that letter,'' said Naipaul.
``He says, settle down and write, think of a character, make me a
character, begin it like this.'' After his father's death he did
precisely that, using him as the inspiration for Biswas.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the myth,'' he said, ``having written two books, the young
writer should be taken up to the skies. In reality, having written
two books, the young writer remained firmly on the ground. Because
the books were not published until later, I was drained, and I
began to play with this idea: a man tells his life and it's in
terms of things which he's acquired, simple things, but in his own
eyes, very big things.'' After the start, he was blocked, but kept
writing and finally after seven months, ``there came a light.''
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning, he intended ``to cannibalize'' one of his
father's stories, published in the posthumous 1976 collection ``The
Adventures of Gurudeva.'' Anand, Biswas' son, is a combination of
the author and his younger brother, Shiva, who later became a
novelist.
</P>
<P>
   Comparing his father with Biswas, Naipaul said: ``My father was
a profounder man in every way. And his wounds are deeper than the
other man can say. It's based on him, but it couldn't be the real
man.'' He said he felt he had inherited his sense of comedy from
his father, and added that others have said that he had his
mother's tenaciousness.
</P>
<P>
   Before and after his artistic breakthrough, Naipaul read all his
work aloud to Patricia Hale, whom he had met at Oxford and who
later became his wife. He recalled, ``For three years, from 1952 to
1955, all I read to her was rubbish. She gave her response and it
was very valuable. When things are going badly, you need someone to
point out what was good'' _ and worth saving. ``I trusted her. I
read everything to Pat, for her approval, even a few days before
she died'' (in 1995). He said that his relationship with her and
with his father had been the deepest ones in his life.
</P>
<P>
   After his father died, Naipaul wrote to his mother, ``What we
are he has made of us.'' Several weeks later, he added, ``In a way
I had always looked upon my life as a continuation of his _ a
continuation which, I hoped, would also be a fulfillment.''
</P>
<P>
   When that letter was quoted to him, he said, ``Neither I nor my
father could have known where the writing was going to lead one, in
terms of the intellectual adventure. I don't think I had  &UR; any &LR;  idea
at the beginning that I was going to be writing about colonialism,
the New World, slavery and revolution _ and about India.''
</P>
<P>
   His career has led him to write 23 books, from his early comic
novels to the richly textured dramatic chronicles of `` Biswas''
and ``A Bend in the River,'' and includes transformative returns to
India, a confrontation with Islam and his later novelistic
contemplations of his place, and way, in the world, as in ``The
Enigma of Arrival.''
</P>
<P>
   He continued: ``The reason why my father would not have been
able to understand where I would eventually go is that the nature
of your society conditions the kind of writing you can do about it.
There are certain societies where intellectual adventure, social
adventure, is necessarily limited,'' as in Trinidad.
</P>
<P>
   To the question of how he became a writer, he said, ``For me
there was always an element of desperation.'' With him, more than
anything, it was the will to be a writer, the innocence in
believing that someone from his background could be a writer and
``the idea of the presence of my father _ I always knew that
regardless of our circumstances that he was a noble man.''
</P>
<P>
   When Naipaul comes to New York, he will read at the 92nd Street
Y (on Jan. 24), but not from his new book. Instead he will draw
upon his other writings. The book of letters remains something
apart from him. Any day a package of copies sent by his publisher
will arrive at his home in Wiltshire, where he lives with his
second wife, Nadira. In all probability the package will remain
unopened.
</P>
<P>
   Thinking about the book and the memories it would evoke, he
said, ``I wonder if I will have enough courage to read it.''

 &HT;    OSHA RULES A THREAT TO TELECOMMUTING, MANY SAY
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Business groups and some employees said Tuesday
that a U.S. Labor Department advisory threatens to halt the popular
trend of telecommuting that has swept American industry, especially
the world of high tech.
</P>
<P>
   The department triggered the controversy by stating that
Occupational Safety and Health Act regulations make employers
responsible for employees' work environments, even when workers
operate from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   The law, enacted 30 years ago, ``applies to work performed by an
employee in any workplace within the United States, including a
workplace located in the employee's home,'' said the advisory
opinion, issued last November in response to an inquiry from CSC
Credit Services, a Houston-based company.
</P>
<P>
   After the advisory was made public by the Washington Post in
Tuesday's editions, industry groups and their allies accused the
Clinton administration of regulatory excess.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's outrageous,'' said Bruce Josten, executive vice president
of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. ``This runs completely counter to
employers' efforts to give workers greater flexibility and counter
to the (Clinton) administration's own emphasis on families.''
</P>
<P>
   By the close of business Tuesday, members of Congress were
considering legislation to reverse the federal advisory, and Labor
Secretary Alexis M. Herman issued a statement appearing to soften
her department's position.
</P>
<P>
   Even though inspecting workplaces is an appropriate federal
role, she said, ``the federal government has neither the desire nor
the resources to investigate private homes in America.''
</P>
<P>
   While the rules for hazardous work are clear, Herman said, ``in
the virtual workplace, where the door never closes, the rules are
not so clear.'' She called for a ``national dialogue'' on the
subject.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated at 20 million American employees now work at least
two days a week in their homes, up from only 4 million in 1990. The
trend has been credited for giving workers more time with their
families and for expanding job opportunities for disabled workers.
Telecommuting is also seen as reducing traffic congestion and
pollution.
</P>
<P>
   The threat of regulation raises serious doubts about the future
of telecommuting, said Jennifer Krese, director of employment
policy for the National Association of Manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really leaves the employer second guessing and not knowing
what they're responsible for,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What if there is lead paint, or a rickety staircase?'' she
asked. ``Would a home be required to have a designated smoke area?
This just opens a whole can of worms.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Wilson, a former Labor Department economist who is now with
the conservative Heritage Foundation, said that under the policy
spelled out, telecommuting would be in serious jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any employer today should be seriously considering the
liability that their company is faced with for a worker who even
takes home a floppy disk to work on a memo or report over the
weekend because that person's home is now covered as a workplace.''
</P>
<P>
   He warned that the effect would b`put a substantial damper
on any productivity gains that we've seen or are likely to see in
the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans on Capitol Hill said they would move to restrict the
federal reach into telecommuting. House Majority Whip Tom DeLay,
R-Texas, accused the Labor Department of ``big brother government
bureaucracy'' and said he would consider enacting a legislative
veto of the advisory opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Frank Wolf, R-Va., the author of legislation to encourage
telecommuting, planned to announce Wednesday that he would sponsor
a bill to block restrictions on it. And Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas,
said in an interview that he was considering writing similar
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's an absolute outrage that OSHA thinks they have
jurisdiction on private homes,'' Paul said. ``I don't think the
average person working at home is begging for all this protection.
I think they would like to be left alone.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Washington Post's Internet site was inundated with
e-mailed protests from people saying they were employees who liked
working from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nutty,'' said one message writer. ``OSHA is going to hurt
workers by drastically reducing their opportunities to work at
home.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most ridiculous ruling I've ever heard of,'' wrote
another. ``No firm will allow telcommuting (sic) if it believes
they are prone to unnecessary liability.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you work at a home it is your decision and your
responsibility!!!'' wrote another, calling for government to ``get
off our backs.''

   HANK-GREENBERG-FILM (Undated) _ ``The Life and Times of Hank
Greenberg,'' a new documentary by Aviva Kempner, of the great
Detroit Tigers slugger. Aviva Kempner and her brother, Jonathan,
knew of Greenberg from their father, Harold, who left Lithuania for
Pittsburgh in 1925 and settled in Detroit. To Harold Kempner,
baseball was a ritual of American assimilation and Greenberg a
symbol. By Richard Sandomir.
</P>
<P>
   LUCIE-AUBRAC-VIDEO (Undated) _ In 1943 in Lyon, France, at the
height of the Nazi occupation, a man jailed for buying sugar and
noodles on the black market gets a note from his wife. ``A third
night without you in a big, hopelessly cold bed,'' it reads.
Nothing like a little Gallic news from home to rally a man.
Unfortunately, Raymond (Daniel Auteuil) is suspected by the state
attorney of belonging to the Resistance, which means he won't be
curling up with Lucie (Carole Bouquet) for quite a while, if ever.
It is at this point that we begin to appreciate the differences
between a thriller from the French director Claude Berri, a student
of the intensely personal in ``Jean de Florette'' and ``Manon of
the Spring,'' and the standard commotion on American screens. By
Peter M. Nichols.

<P>
   FEDERAL-THEATER-PROJECT (New York) _ Hallie Flanagan
(1890-1969), who headed the Federal Theater Project in its brave
and troubled existence, deserves better. The movie ``Cradle Will
Rock,'' treats her deservedly as a heroine of America's one effort
to create what she envisioned as a free, adult, uncensored theater.
But in trying to reproduce the commotions of the 1930s, the film
director, Tim Robbins, captured by nostalgia for the left,
diminishes her accomplishment. By Walter Goodman.

   WRONG-MOUNTAIN-THEATER (New York) _ David Hirson's second play,
``Wrong Mountain,'' will open on Thursday at Eugene O'Neill
Theater. His first play ``La Bete,'' set in 17th-century France,
opened at the same theater on Feb. 10, 1991, and very shortly
became one of the most famous flops in Broadway history. ``Wrong
Mountain,'' directed by Richard Jones, who also directed ``La
Bete,'' makes demands on the audience to see in the lives of
artists, reflections of their own existential problems. This time
Hirson's play has a contemporary setting, and it is written in
nonrhyming prose, the story of Henry Dennett, 60, an embittered,
unappreciated poet who, infuriated by the presumption of his
ex-wife's new boyfriend, a popular playwright named Guy Halperin,
makes a bet that he can write a play and have it produced. By Bruce

   MARILYN-HORNE-MUSIC (New York) _ Marilyn Horne has been worried
about the song recital for some time. As an art form the song
recital has been languishing, she says, which is why seven years
ago she set up a foundation to do something about it. Ms. Horne
speaks of the problem with considerable authority. Besides being
one of the great operatic mezzo-sopranos in history, she has been
an devoted recitalist. She lost count of total number of recitals
she has given when the tally topped 1,300 a few years back. By

<P>
   BOSTRIDGE-MUSIC (Undated) _ Not since Peter Pears faded from the
spotlight in the 1970s has an English tenor garnered more attention
than Ian Bostridge. Suddenly, this redoubtable 35-year-old seems
everywhere on CD, capturing the interest of music lovers throughout
Europe and America. And though some mavens have demurred, the hype
has been buttressed by albums remarkable for both artistic quality
and repertorial variety. By David Mermelstein.
</P>
<P>
   20TH-CENTURY-MUSIC (Undated) _ The 20th century was, in musical
terms, a noisy one. I don't mean loud or even discordant, the
customary complaints of audiences encountering new music, whether
Igor Stravinsky's ``Rite of Spring,'' John Coltrane's ``Ascension''
or Jimi Hendrix's Woodstock rendition of the national anthem. I'm
referring, rather, to the way that 20th-century composers have
embraced sounds _ environmental, industrial, often random _ and
thereby laid siege to inherited notions of musical order. If last
century's avant-garde taught us anything, it is that such
disturbances can be the stuff of art. By Adam Shatz.

<P>
   ENSOR-ART (Brussels, Belguim) _ By the time James Ensor
celebrated his 30th birthday, in 1890, he was already an
exceptional painter. Equally comfortable with portraits, still
lifes, domestic interiors and seascapes, he had learned what he
wanted from his French Impressionist contemporaries and was now
going his own way. Yet, when he died in 1949, aged 89, he was a
relatively marginal figure, regarded as something of an eccentric
by his fellow Belgians and known abroad principally for the
sinister masked figures and skeletons that peopled many of his
paintings, drawings and etchings. But talented he was, above all in
his early years, as quickly becomes apparent in a major
retrospective of his work, organized by the Royal Museums of Fine
Arts of Belgium and on display at the Museum of Ancient Art in
Brussels through Feb. 13. By Alan Riding.

<P>
   MCCLEERY-BIRDS-ART (Undated) _ Dr. James M. McCleery, a
collector of stamps and coins since childhood, redirected his focus
in 1963 to buying decorative bird carvings and, later, to acquiring
vintage American decoys. His carved birds will be auctioned at
Sotheby's in New York. The 450 lots of decoys and 180 lots of
duck-calling instruments, traps, shell boxes, prints and baskets
will be auctioned on Jan. 22 and 23. By Rita Reif.

<P>
   METROPOLITAN-MUSEUM (New York) _ If asked to say what you love
about the Metropolitan Museum of Art, you might think of mummies or
shining armor or old-master paintings in curly gold frames. You
might even think of the grand central staircase, which, when you
descend it, makes you feel like an affluent if doomed character in
a turn-of-the-last-century Edith Wharton novel. But you probably
wouldn't think of contemporary art. Virtually since it opened in
1870, the Met has been accused of snubbing the art of the present.

IMPASSE OVER WEST BANK TROOP WITHDRAWAL BROKEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Israeli and Palestinian negotiators signed an
agreement Tuesday night that broke a seven-week impasse in carrying
out the next phase of withdrawal of Israeli troops from the West
Bank.
</P>
<P>
   The pullback of Israeli forces from a further 5 percent of the
occupied West Bank is expected to take place by Thursday, just as
the holiday marking the end of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan
begins.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to move forward was seen by observers as an
encouraging sign that Israel would continue to pay attention to the
Palestinian track of the peace process even while it is involved in
intense, ongoing negotiations in West Virginia on the Syrian track.
</P>
<P>
   ``It proves that it is absolutely possible to balance two tracks
of the peace process simultaneously,'' said Barry Rubin, who
monitors the peace process for Bar-Ilan University's Begin-Sadat
Center for Strategic Studies. ``The Palestinians have been arguing
this, and this proves it is a total myth.''
</P>
<P>
   The 5 percent redeployment, with 2 percent moving to full
Palestinian control and 3 percent moving to shared control, was the
second in a three-phase interim agreement laid out in September.
</P>
<P>
   The interim agreement had broken down on Nov. 15 just as the
Israelis prepared to hand over the 5 percent. Palestinian President
Yasser Arafat balked, saying that the land offered was too sparsely
populated and did not connect to areas already under Palestinian
control.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement reached Tuesday will go by the initially offered
Israeli maps, a step which observers saw as a retreat by the
Palestinian negotiating team, which many see as anxious not to be
relegated to the sidelines while Israel actively negotiates with
Syria.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli and Palestinian negotiators also reaffirmed Tuesday that
the third phase of an additional pullback from 6.1 percent of the
West Bank would take place on Jan. 20 as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis had carried out the first phase withdrawal on
schedule from 7 percent in early September, handing it to
Palestinian rule while retaining overall control over security.
</P>
<P>
   After the many interim agreements and stalled implementations of
the more than six-year-old peace process first signed in 1993 in
Oslo, Norway, the Palestinians now have full or partial control of
slightly less than 40 percent of the West Bank, which Israel
captured from Jordan in the 1967 Six Day War.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's important is not the delays, which always happen. What
is important is what is implemented, and the sense of movement
forward,'' added Rubin.
</P>
<P>
   he movement forward seems to be setting the stage for the
agreement on a framework to be established by the two sides'
self-imposed deadline of mid-February for the final phase of the
peace process. The so-called ``final status talks'' are considered
the most difficult since they take on the powerfully emotional and
strategic issues of the status of Jerusalem which both sides claim
as a capital, the existence of Israeli settlements in the West
Bank, the return of Palestinian refugees, and the defining of the
final borders between Israel and the Palestinian Authority.
</P>
<P>
   The issues on the table between Israel and Syria in talks that
got underway Monday in Sheperdstown, West Virginia are seen as less
complex than those on the Israeli-Palestinian track. Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak is eager to reach an agreement with Damascus to
keep an election promise to get Israeli troops out of Lebanon,
which is largely viewed as a Syrian client state, by the summer.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton is motivated as well for a deal to be reached
to cap years of Herculean diplomatic efforts by his White House to
establish peace in the Middle East. And Syria's Hafez Assad is seen
as a willing player to seize the opportunity now for a peace deal
since his health is reportedly failing and he wants to have a
smooth transition of power to his son.
</P>
<P>
   Uri Savir, a member of Israel's parliament and one of the
architects of the Oslo peace process, said in an interview about
the ongoing Syrian-Israeli talks, ``This round of talks is
critical. The timing is critical, and it is important that there is
some momentum now.''
</P>
<P>
   In West Virginia, the talks have not so far produced any
breakthroughs. Barak and his negotiating partner, Syrian Foreign
Minister Farouk Sharaa have met separately with Clinton. But State
Department spokesman James Rubin said Tuesday that face-to-face
talks between the two over the return of the Golan Heights to Syria
and security gurantees for Israel did not ``pan out.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Syrian government-controlled media warned that if
advances are not made in West Virginia a ``deep freeze'' could
follow. ``Unless there is a breakthrough very soon, the whole
process for making peace will come to a dangerous recess,'' the
English-language daily Syria Times reported.

PROGRAM STRIVING TO SECURE A LEGACY OF WILDLIFE HABITAT FOR TEXAS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ART CHAPMAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKE JACKSON, Texas _ Deep in the South Texas wetlands, between
the city of Brazoria and the Texas Gulf Coast, a small dog-trot
cabin sits in the shade of massive oak and native pecan trees. It
is considered Texas' oldest Anglo-built home, constructed in 1826
by a tanner in the original Austin Colony.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, the historically rich house was on private
property. Many people in Brazoria County didn't even know it
existed. Those who did didn't know its history.
</P>
<P>
   Now the house belongs to the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``My aunt Nannie bought this place when I was just a baby, back
in 1941 or '42,'' said Percival Beacroft, the former owner who has
just turned the property over to the Texas Parks and Wildlife
Department. ``It's been in my family all of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Beacroft sold the cabin and more than 3,500 acres to the state,
and the property is now part of the Austin Woods Conservation
Initiative, a collection of forests and wetlands that are tools in
the state's fight to replace lost wildlife habitat.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Department of Transportation bought the property as a
``wetland mitigation bank.'' What that means is that every time the
state builds a new road or bridge in the Texas coastal area, it is
using up valuable habitat for migratory birds and other wildlife.
To mitigate that loss, the state replaces that land.
</P>
<P>
   The same applies to industry. When Dow Chemical decided to
expand its facilities in Lake Jackson, the company purchased about
3,000 acres of coastal marshes near the Peach Point Wildlife
Management Area in Freeport. That property was also turned over to
the state to compensate for lost habitat.
</P>
<P>
   It is a valuable, necessary habitat. Doppler radar images show
waves and waves of birds approaching Texas coastal forests after
flying nonstop across the Gulf of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Those who have witnessed the spring migration say the birds
literally fall into the trees, exhausted from their flight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Texas coastal forests like those we are protecting with this
effort are essential stopover habitat for some of the best-loved
songbirds that migrate between the Americas,'' said Andrew Sansom,
executive director of Texas Parks and Wildlife. ``Without these
wetlands, some of these birds might never see Canada or Costa
Rica.''
</P>
<P>
   Sansom, who grew up in the Lake Jackson area, said the
historical significance of the tanner's house is an added delight
for the state, which wouldn't have had money to purchase the house
separately. He envisions a living history exhibit at the log house,
where volunteers will educate visitors about the lives of early
settlers.
</P>
<P>
   To help finance that exhibit, he has placed the Austin Woods
project on the list of projects to be funded through the Lone Star
Legacy program. Lone Star Legacy is a $25 million endowment that
will help fund five new projects for Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Also on the list are the state bison herd, a rivers center, a
birding center and a Hill Country nature area.
</P>
<P>
   The $25 million won't be enough, but it is a start. Texas,
unfortunately and embarrassingly, is 49th in the nation when it
comes to per capita spending for parks and wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   It is truly up to the people of Texas to save the state's
historical sites. Lone Star Legacy is one way to contribute.
</P>
<P>
   For information on contributing to Lone Star Legacy, contact the
Parks and Wildlife Foundation of Texas at (214) 720-1478.

MUSICAL MIX MARKS GRAMMY NOMINATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hollywood casting agents couldn't have devised a more intriguing
scenario for this year's Grammy nominations. First, bring back a
cosmic rocker (Santana), add a timeless queen of camp (Cher), then
mix in a few, MTV-pushed upstarts in Ricky Martin and the
Backstreet Boys. Finally, just as the audience is gasping for air,
add an alluring jazz presence in Diana Krall and a squabbling R&AMP;B
group in TLC. The result? Well, we'll see when the 42nd annual
Grammy awards are telecast by CBS on Feb. 23 from Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   For now, just shake your head and applaud the mischievousness of
the 10,000-plus voters in the National Academy of Recording Arts
and Sciences. They've stacked the deck this year with
possibilities, including citing Boston blueswoman Susan Tedeschi
for best new artist, where she'll compete with the Britney Spears
of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Most observers agree that 1999 wasn't the deepest year for music
_ there was no equivalent to Paul Simon's ``Graceland,'' that's for
sure _ but it's hard to fault the 10 nominations for Santana, the
wizened Latin-rock veteran who rode the coattails of some younger
acts (Dave Matthews and Rob Thomas of Matchbox 20) to make the
year's finest collaborative CD, which was also among the most
adventurous.
</P>
<P>
   Santana's ``Smooth,'' his hit song with Thomas, is up for record
of the year against Cher's disco-fried ``Believe,'' Ricky Martin's
hip-shaking ``Livin' La Vida Loca,'' and TLC's widely praised ``No
Scrubs.''
</P>
<P>
   Santana's album, ``Supernatural,'' goes against the Backstreet
Boys (``Millennium''), Diana Krall (``When I Look in Your Eyes''),
TLC (``Fanmail''), and the Dixie Chicks (``Fly''). The latter is
noteworthy because it continues country music's emergence in the
top mainstream categories.
</P>
<P>
   Other multiple Grammy nominees included TLC with eight,
conductor Pierre Boulez with six, Asleep at the Wheel with five
(based on the group's excellent tribute album to Bob Wills and the
Texas Playboys, ``Ride with Bob''), and four each for the
Backstreet Boys, Lauryn Hill, Dixie Chicks, Emmylou Harris, and
Whitney Houston. Martin and Cher each had three.
</P>
<P>
   Blueswoman Tedeschi was the big vote-getter. She did the Boston
blues scene proud, as did Bill Morrissey, nominated for best
traditional folk album for his ``Songs of Mississippi John Hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   The jazz categories included several musicians with local ties.
Berklee College vice president and vibes giant Gary Burton received
two nominations for his CD ``Like Minds'' (best jazz instrumental
performance, individual or group) and the track ``Straight Up and
Down'' (jazz instrumental solo), while Chelsea native Chick Corea
got a pair in the same categories for his ``Change'' CD and the
track ``Wigwam.'' Former Bostonians Sam Rivers also got a large
jazz ensemble performance nod for his album ``Inspiration,'' and
Krall (who paid dues at the Boston Harbor Hotel before she was
discovered) added a best jazz vocal performance to her album of the
year nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Rounder Records, the Cambridge, Mass. label, was also shouting
hosannas. Rounder distributes Tone-Cool Records (Tedeschi's label)
and the Morrissey disc. Rounder enjoyed further success with
country/bluegrass star Alison Krauss (two nominations), reggae
patriarch Burning Spear (one), R&AMP;B legend Ruth Brown (one) and
another legend, Wilson Pickett (one), who made his first comeback
album in many years.
</P>
<P>
   While mainstream trends again dominated the voting, the Grammy
nominations showed a greater embracing of alternative music than
usual. That was most apparent in the DJ/techno world. DJs Fatboy
Slim and Moby won nominations for best alternative music
performance, as did Nine Inch Nails.
</P>
<P>
   The continued spread of bubblegum-pop was not just seen in the
nods to the Backstreet Boys and Britney Spears, but also in the way
`N Sync crossed genres. `N Sync earned one nomination for best pop
collaboration with vocals (``Music of My Heart'' with Gloria
Estefan), and another for best country collaboration with vocals
(with Alabama for ``God Must Have Spent a Little More Time on
You'').
</P>
<P>
   The rap categories also became more cutting edge and featured a
continued healthy trend toward including more women. Lauryn Hill
was a presence once again (she was the Grammy darling last year),
while Janet Jackson popped up with Busta Rhymes for best rap
performance by a duo or group (for ``What's It Gonna Be?!'') and
Erykah Badu received a nod with the Roots for ``You Got Me.''
Perhaps the biggest surprise in the rap fields was the acceptance
of foul-mouthed, white-boy rapper, Eminem, who earned three
nominations.
</P>
<P>
   The return of hard-rock music _ one of the stories of '99 _ was
seen in the nominations for Limp Bizkit (the band's ubiquitous
``Nookie'' is up for hard-rock performance), as well as for
warhorses Black Sabbath and Metallica, and newcomers Kid Rock and
Buckcherry. Rage Against the Machine might seem the one absentee,
but its album came out past the voting deadline. Wait 'til next
year for Rage.

   HAVANA _ Guantanamo, Cuba's easternmost province, is popularly
described as ``el lugar donde nace el sol,'' the place where the
day begins. As one travels from Havana through desolate cane fields
and depressed towns, Guantanamo City does rise up like a
renaissance town. Some of its arcaded central buildings have been
repainted. A band shell sits on its main square, and families walk
to the theater on weekday nights. Guantanameros attribute their
cultural life in part to the work of Elfriede Mahler, an American
dancer who arrived in Havana in the summer of 1960.
</P>
<P>
   An unlikely transplant, Ms. Mahler, born in Bryn Mawr, Pa., in
1917 and steeped in the dance movements of Isadora Duncan and
Martha Graham, became a folk hero here during her last 18 years,
all devoted to the arts in Guantanamo. Before she died in 1998 at
the age of 81, she had founded the province's first professional
dance company, Danza Libre, which will celebrate its 10th
anniversary in January.
</P>
<P>
   Danza Libre, a company of 25 dancers and musicians, creates
modern work and preserves and retrains dancers in the country's
disappearing Afro-Cuban traditions. Danza Libre's modern dance
combines the strength of folk spirit with the intensive formal
training its dancers received from Ms. Mahler.
</P>
<P>
   Alfredo Velasquez, a founding member of Danza Libre and its
director, remembers her as ``a whirlwind, always creating and
looking for something new.''
</P>
<P>
   Velasquez directs the company under serious handicaps. The
government still pays dancers' salaries, about $15 a month, but it
no longer helps pay for costumes, sets and tours, which it once
did. The company has to search for financing, just as capitalist
producers do.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the perennial problem of soloists' leaving to
accept offers from Cuba's two national companies, dancers who are
unable to live on state salaries often depart to work in the
tourist sector or live abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Danza Libre will celebrate its 10th anniversary with a
performance on Jan. 26 that will include new work by Velasquez and
others, folkloric dance and Ms. Mahler's last work ``Tiempo Muerto,
Tiempo Vivo,'' celebrating Jesus Menendez, an organizer of
cane-cutters who was assassinated in 1948. She changed a narrative
dance she originally choreographed in the 1980s with masked
Afro-Cuban ``ireme'' (spirits) taking part in the action into this
new version, representing the spirit of Menendez.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mahler left Cuba's national contemporary dance company in
1962 to start what was called the aficionado movement. This was a
national effort to preserve folklore and to develop teachers who
could unify diverse folk traditions into a cohesive cultural
identity. The Cuban government was initially wary of Afro-Cuban
culture because it was perceived as counterrevolutionary and as
competition with the government for the people's loyalty. The
government eventually recognized the value of linking Cuban folk
traditions to the state. So the Havana Libre Hotel, formerly the
Conrad Hilton and the first headquarters of the revolutionary
government, was put to use as a dance center, and Ms. Mahler was
drafted to train prospective dance teachers from all over Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mahler said she had fallen in love with the people of
Guantanamo, the way they moved and expressed themselves with their
bodies. They in turn recognized that she translated all that she
perceived in that motion into a choreography called Gestos Cubanos.
Guantanameros still talk about how dance gave them insights they
had never had about themselves.
</P>
<P>
   In 1966 Ms. Mahler was recalled to Havana to become director of
the National School of the Arts, whose dance program she helped
create. But in 1981 she returned to Guantanamo to begin a new
project, building a regional school of the arts. She spent nine
years developing its dancers and then established Danza Libre. At
age 73 she was virtually unstoppable, and Carlos Hernandez, then
the province's director of culture, remembers her skills as a
producer in the state system. He recalled, ``You came to her with a
dream, and she showed you how to make it a reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mahler's choreography often had political or historical
subject matter. In Cuba she lived as an exemplary Communist, even
making it a point to demonstrate that she could survive decently on
what the government provided.
</P>
<P>
   Many contemporary works explore the exhaustion and dislocation
resulting from Cuba's financial problems. Marinella Boan, a
choreographer who studied with Ms. Mahler, encapsulated these
conditions in ``Fishes Swimming Around the Tower.'' This work
begins as dancers with suitcases circle the stage to the sound of
the sea. At night they escape and find solace dancing the rumba,
but by day they barter, selling even themselves for goods. To
Cubans, that entrapment can be seen as a condemnation of the U.S.
government for its embargo or of the Cuban government for its
restrictiveness, or as both.
</P>
<P>
   Jorge Nunez, head of the province's writers and artists union,
said, ``Elfriede Mahler is as important in Guantanamo as our poet
laureate, Regino Botti.'' Her legacy remains alive among the Cuban
people. And whenever the dancers speak of Ms. Mahler, they say they
carry a little piece of her inside.

   BOSTON _ John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co. is acquiring the
individual long-term care business of Fortis, a Dutch-Belgian
financial services company.
</P>
<P>
   Terms of the deal were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, which comes on the eve of Hancock's planned
initial public offering, gives the life insurer a business with $90
million in premiums and nearly 94,000 policies. Hancock's own
long-term care unit, with 155,000 policies in force, had premiums
of $200 million in the first nine months of last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This purchase continues Hancock's ongoing acquisition strategy
to grow core businesses,'' said Hancock President David
D'Alessandro in a statement Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Hancock said the acquisition would give it access to an
established national network of long-term care insurance brokers
and allow it to introduce new long-term care products.
</P>
<P>
   Fortis, which operates primarily in Belgium, the Netherlands,
and Luxembourg and has assets of $390 billion, runs its long-term
care unit out of Milwaukee. The business eventually will be
relocated to Boston, where Hancock will absorb the unit's
marketing, underwriting, and operations.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman Bros. served as Hancock's adviser on the transaction.
</P>
<P>
   Hancock is one of the nation's leading mutual insurers, a
company owned by its policyholders. The company, which has $125
billion in assets, plans to issue first-time stock to the investing
public on Jan. 27.

   The High Court temporarily blocked the extradition to Northern
Ireland of a former Irish Republican Army man facing a life
sentence for killing a British officer in Belfast in 1980. Angelo
Fusco, 43, was arrested by the Irish police and was being driven to
the border when the court intervened. Fusco, who served 10 years in

COKE APPOINTS HIGHEST-RANKING BLACK EXECUTIVE TO HEAD NEW
DIVISION 
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Ga.)  (nk) 
 By CONSTANCE L. HAYS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a move that one analyst said effectively righted a wrong,
Coca-Cola's president on Tuesday named Carl H. Ware, who is the
company's highest-ranking black executive and had announced plans
to step down, as head of a newly created division in charge of
corporate affairs and government relations.
</P>
<P>
   Ware, 56, a senior vice president in charge of Coke's Africa
business who announced in November that he would retire from the
company at the end of this year, said he changed his plans after
discussions with Douglas N. Daft, the president, about a new
position began several weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``This job is new, substantive, operational and it goes beyond
traditional corporate affairs,'' Ware said in an interview. ``It
seemed like such a good opportunity that I could ill afford to pass
on it.''
</P>
<P>
   His decision to step down had caused concern in Atlanta's civil
rights community, among other places, because Ware was co-head of a
diversity council Coca-Cola formed last spring after a group of
black employees sued the company, charging racial discrimination.
In addition, his departure _ announced shortly after a management
shuffle in October that reassigned him to report to a fellow senior
vice president _ would have left the soft-drink giant with an
entirely white and male senior management group.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was time to right the wrong,'' said Emanuel Goldman, a
global consumer products analyst with Merrill Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   Ware was named executive vice president and will take charge of
monitoring Coca-Cola's strategies in the United States and abroad
in terms of the way they affect the company's image. ``I believe,
frankly, that our image depends on our actions,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That image has been under siege for the last couple of years, as
Coca-Cola has watched its profits fall and its marketing strategies
and acquisition plans come under attack from regulators. In June,
the company had its biggest product recall in history when Belgians
said they became ill after drinking Coca-Cola and Fanta, and
Coca-Cola's management was criticized for being slow to respond to
the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Ware himself became part of Coca-Cola's image problem after he
announced he would leave the company a few days after a management
reorganization that assigned him to report to Daft, then merely
another senior vice president, rather than M. Douglas Ivester, the
chairman and chief executive. Ware was widely seen as unhappy with
the arrangement, and it may have been among the issues that led to
Ivester's decision to step down last month.
</P>
<P>
   Ware said on Tuesday that he had been thinking about retiring
``for quite some time prior to Doug Ivester's reorganization,'' but
added that he changed his mind after meeting with Daft last month.
Daft was named president and chief operating officer on Dec. 6, the
day Ivester shocked the company and the business world by
announcing he would retire himself, barely two years after taking
over the top jobs at Coke.
</P>
<P>
   In his new role, Ware will join the company's executive
committee and will report directly to Daft. Daft is expected to
become chairman and chief executive in April.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carl's principal role is to ensure that the Coca-Cola Co.
continues to be welcome around the world,'' Daft said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   Ware will continue to co-chair Coca-Cola's diversity council,
and said his efforts would concentrate on the United States at
first. ``We will be taking a very hard look at the human resources
policies, the human resources strategy and the development of
people, making sure we have the appropriate and adequate
representation of race and gender,'' he said. ``We will focus first
on the U.S., and then cascade these learnings around the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer for the Coke employees who sued the company said
Tuesday he hoped Ware's promotion would presage others at
Coca-Cola. ``The real question for Daft is not one promotion, but
whether he will have the guts or the vision to put an end to the
glass ceilings thwarting African-Americans at the company,'' said
the lawyer, Cyrus Mehri.

CLINTON NOMINATES GREENSPAN TO FOURTH TERM 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: See optional trim) 
 
By STEVE LASH 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton nominated Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan to another term Tuesday, reassuring
financial markets by keeping the widely respected central banker on
for another four years.
</P>
<P>
   While Greenspan's pronouncements on money are normally opaque,
he has won the confidence of investors, both big and small, by
leading the financial markets through both stock a market crash and
a marathon boom.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the past 12 years, Chairman Greenspan has guided the
Federal Reserve with a rare combination of technical expertise,
sophisticated analysis and old-fashioned common sense,'' Clinton
said with Greenspan by his side in the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   George Ball, chairman of the Sanders Morris Mundy investment
firm in Houston, said Greenspan has kept the economy on track with
``delicate'' adjustments to interest rates and money supply.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you find anybody in the financial industry who does
anything but put their flippers together for the renomination, I
would be struck dumb,'' Ball said. ``Both the substance and the
perception of his hand at the monetary helm has been superb.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though Greenspan is a Republican _ originally nominated by
President Reagan in 1987 _ he's developed a close relationship with
this Democratic administration, which followed his advice to cut
the deficit.
</P>
<P>
   While the Fed chairman's term ended in late June, the
announcement Tuesday kills any speculation that Greenspan might not
be reappointed.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's decision won praise from leading Senate Republicans,
including Majority Leader Trent Lott of Mississippi, who predicted
Greenspan would easily be confirmed by the Senate to a fourth term.
</P>
<P>
   Resistance isn't likely from Texas Senator Phil Gramm, the
Republican who chairs the Banking Committee that will hold the
confirmation hearing, who described Greenspan as: ``the finest in a
long line of great central bankers.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan said he looks forward to continuing his stewardship of
the Federal Reserve. He described the job as: ''It's like eating
peanuts. You keep doing it, keep doing it and you never get tired,
because the future is always ultimately unknowable.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Oval office announcement Greenspan praised Clinton and
his administration,
</P>
<P>
   ``My colleagues and I have been very appreciative of your
support of the Fed over the years and your commitment to fiscal
discipline which, as you know . . . has been instrumental in
achieving what in a few weeks . . . will be longest economic
expansion in the nation's history.''
</P>
<P>
   The economic expansion has continued since April 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed has been credited with pursuing an interest rate policy
that prevented a perilous rise in the inflation rate during a
period of rapid economic growth and low unemployment, which
normally mean rising inflation.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gary Beauchamp, economic strategist at AIM Management Group in
Houston, lauded the Fed chairman for bucking conventional economic
wisdom. Greenspan understood that the common wisdom that the
unemployment rate could not go significantly lower than 6 percent
without driving up wages and consumer prices, no longer held.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was one of the first policy-makers to realize that new
technologies and global competition ... would allow unemployment to
go lower and growth to go higher,'' Beauchamp added. ``Your
competitor is no longer the guy across the street but the person on
the other side of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   He also praised Greenspan for urging the Clinton administration
in 1993 to focus its attention on cutting the deficit, a campaign
that turned the nation's red ink into a surplus.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas and chairman of the House Ways and
Means Committee, praised Clinton's choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chairman Greenspan believes strongly in lower taxes, less
government spending, paying down the debt and creating jobs at home
by expanding trade overseas,'' Archer said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While economists give Greenspan high marks, his record is not
unblemished.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Greenspan has made some mistakes ... but he's learned
as he's gone along,'' said Barton Smith, a University of Houston
economics professor. ``Overall, you've got to give him a lot of
credit.''
</P>
<P>
   On the debit side of Greenspan's Fed ledger are his actions in
1987 that led to the stock market crash in October of that year
when he strongly suggested a rate increase to come, Smith said. But
in the credit column are his successful efforts since to prevent
inflation before it got out of hand without stifling the economy.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Greenspan showed off his style of economic management
when he raised rates at the first hint of rising price increases.
Smith said. That pre-emptive move marked a refreshing change from
the Fed's historic practice of acting only after the inflation rate
had reached near-crisis proportions, which required severe action
that risked a recession.
</P>
<P>
   ``He put his foot on the brakes way early, so the economy never
had to go into a skid,'' Smith said. ``It turned out to be an
incredibly smart move. It allowed the economic expansion of the
'90s to continue.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan is perhaps best-known for his expression of concern
for investors' ``irrational exuberance'' in the bullish stock
market in December 1996.
</P>
<P>
   He entered public life in 1968, when he became the economic
adviser to former president Richard Nixon's election campaign, and
chaired President Gerald Ford's Council of Economic Advisers from
1974 to 1977.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan headed the National Commission on Social Security
Reform, which recommended changes to keep the retirement system
solvent in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   He was appointed to the Federal Reserve for a first term by
Ronald Reagan and reappointed to subsequent terms by George Bush
and Clinton.

PUTIN'S POTENTIAL CHALLENGERS, FEW TO BEGIN WITH, LYING LOW 
</HEADLINE>
 (With RUSSIA-CHECHNYA) 
(nk) 
 By MICHAEL WINES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ The nagging question Tuesday, as Russian officials
began laboriously assembling the machinery for Russia's second
post-Soviet presidential election, was not how or when the vote
would be held. It was why.
</P>
<P>
   With less than 12 weeks remaining until the likeliest election
date in late March, not a single serious politician has firmly
committed to running against acting President Vladimir Putin.
Commentators are rating the prospects of anyone who does as close
to zero.
</P>
<P>
   Even the semi-official Interfax news service, in a recent
commentary, said the campaign threatens to be queasily evocative of
rubber-stamp elections in the Soviet days.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're right back where we started from,'' Pavel Voshchanov, a
radio commentator and one of Boris Yeltsin's former press
secretaries, said in an interview Tuesday. ``We had a situation
where Gorbachev ran as president and there was no alternative. And
now we have Putin and there may be no alternative.''
</P>
<P>
   But a week can be a year in Russia, and what look's like a sure
thing now can be undone in a moment. The war in Chechnya, which has
propelled Putin's popularity, could go badly in the next several
weeks to name just one uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's rivals are undoubtedly weighing such odds and lying low
for now.
</P>
<P>
   The Yabloko Party leader, Grigory Yavlinsky, who has been
preparing a presidential bid for years, has not been heard from
since Yeltsin resigned in favor of Putin on New Year's Eve.
Aleksandr Lebed, the bluff ex-general who ran in 1996, said Tuesday
he is too busy in Krasnoyarsk, where he is governor, to run this
year.
</P>
<P>
   The Communist Party leader and Yeltsin's only serious rival in
1996, Gennady Zyuganov, said he was sure the left would field a
candidate, but was studiously equivocal about his own ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   Among realistic contenders, that leaves only former Prime
Minister Yevgeny Primakov, who declared himself a candidate last
month but has now fallen silent, reassessing things in light of
Putin's ascension.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's handlers, naturally enough, would be loath to have it
any other way, and pressed on Tuesday with a regimen of
campaign-style events that have kept their boss at the top of the
news.
</P>
<P>
   After a senior aide told reporters on Sunday that Putin's defeat
was a near-impossibility, the normally impassive acting president
appeared on Russian Public Television on Tuesday for a determinedly
emotional chat about the presidency (``I never strove toward
this''), the palatial Kremlin (``This belongs to the country'') and
his somber assumption of power from Yeltsin (``He said simply:
`Take care of Russia.''').
</P>
<P>
   Away from the cameras, Putin fired several minor aides, named a
new press secretary and protocol chief and scheduled a meeting with
newly elected parliamentary leaders for Wednesday. He also forced
out Yeltsin's daughter, who had been a top Kremlin adviser to her
father.
</P>
<P>
   Preparations for the election, meanwhile, began somewhat
jerkily. The chairman of the Central Election Commission, Aleksandr
Veshnyakov, said Russian law requires that the vote take place on
March 26, although the upper house of Parliament, the Federation
Council, will meet on Wednesday to decide for itself when to vote.
</P>
<P>
   Veshnyakov also said prospective candidates have until Feb. 13
to submit petitions bearing 500,000 signatures _ half the total
that Putin's first deputy chief of staff, Igor Shabdurasulov, had
said were required just two days ago.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear by day's end which figure was right. Nor was it
clear whether it made much difference, given the spare field of
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The only nationally known politician to definitively declare
himself in the race against Putin is Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the
often bizarre nationalist known for his manual on teen-age sex,
attacks on a woman and a priest on the floor of parliament and
unswerving support of Yeltsin's policies.
</P>
<P>
   He is not regarded as a serious contender. But to be fair, no
one save Primakov is regarded as even a potentially serious
contender _ and so far, Primakov is not talking.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The resounding silence of most politicians so far may stem from
the fact that Russians have been on New Year's holiday the entire
time since Yeltsin resigned. Putin was unable even to haul
legislative leaders into the Kremlin for a meeting on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Or it could be that some potential opponents are negotiating
behind the scenes with Putin, offering their support in exchange
for a top cabinet position or some other reward. A number of
Russian governors who opposed Putin's camp in last month's
legislative elections already have had a change of heart and
decided to join the Kremlin team.
</P>
<P>
   Primakov, the center-left alternative to what so far seems
Putin's center-right rule, is almost certainly not among the
negotiators. Now mulling his options, he may signal his political
intentions next Monday, according to Interfax.
</P>
<P>
   What he does may rest on whether he can work out an alliance
with the Communists for their support in March, Leonid Dobrakhatov,
an informal adviser to the Communist Party leadership, said in an
interview Tuesday.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   As recently as August, Primakov was far and away Russians'
favorite in polls to succeed Yeltsin, and his new political party,
Fatherland-All Russia, seemed aimed for victory in the
parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
   But the Kremlin and Putin stole his lead with their tough
prosecution of the war against Chechen rebels, and a mudslinging
campaign last month reduced Fatherland to a parliamentary also-ran.
</P>
<P>
   In the last presidential poll by the All-Russia Center for
Public Opinion Research, in mid-December, 52 percent of 1,600
respondents said they believed that Putin would be the next
president, compared to 5 percent each for Primakov and the
Communists' Zyuganov. The margin of error was plus or minus 3.8
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Zyuganov is widely judged, even by fellow Communists, to stand
no chance of becoming president. Even though he can count on 25 to
30 percent of the national vote, a solid majority of Russian voters
are sworn anti-Communists.
</P>
<P>
   But Primakov, whose grandfatherly mien and straightforward
political style have won the regard of many Russians, might pose a
challenge to Putin should he be able to add the Communist third of
the electorate to his own base.
</P>
<P>
   Dobrakhatov said Primakov and Zyuganov have been ``talking
intensely'' in recent days, but have not reached any accord.
Moreover, the chances of an agreement may be slim.
</P>
<P>
   The Communists would face a wrenching and even historic decision
in electing to support an outsider, even one with as distinguished
a career in Soviet politics as Primakov.
</P>
<P>
   The wound might be salved if Zyuganov or another top communist
joined the Primakov ticket, perhaps as his choice for prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
   But while Primakov is friendly toward the Communists, many of
his advisers _ and his supporters _ are not, making such an
alliance a tough proposition from the start.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all speculation, but at the same time I believe they're
considering it seriously,'' Dobrakhatov said. ``But if they would
decide to go together, a lot of work must be done with the camps'
supporters and electorate to do it smoothly.''
</P>
<P>
   Zyuganov is ambiguous about the future. After Yeltsin's
resignation last Friday, he said that the Communist Party would
support a slate of choices for president and key appointive
offices, including prime minister and cabinet ministers.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he would run for president, however, Zyuganov said
only that Communists would ``go to the presidential elections as a
unified team.''

BAAN'S CHIEF RESIGNS AS FIRM REPORTS $250-MILLION LOSS FOR
QUARTER 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ The Baan Co. NV, Europe's second-largest
software company, announced on Tuesday that its chief executive had
resigned and that it will report as much as $250 million in losses
for the last quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The twin announcements sent the Dutch company's stock down by 32
percent, erasing more than $1 billion in shareholder value. The
shares fell 4.68 euros on the Amsterdam exchange to 10.10 euros or
about $10.40. Baan shares traded in the United States fell $4.6875
to $10.125.
</P>
<P>
   Baan's news also raised new doubts about its ability to survive
as an independent company. Once one of Europe's most visible
high-technology success stories, Baan's recent history has been
dominated by declining sales, departing executives and bookkeeping
scandals.
</P>
<P>
   Based in Barneveld, the Netherlands, Baan announced that its
American chief executive, Mary Coleman, had resigned after eight
months in the top job ``to pursue other technology-related
opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   It also announced it would write off about $200 million in
assets as part of a broad new ``restructuring'' program. Combined
with operating losses, the company predicted total losses in the
fourth quarter between $240 million and $250 million.
</P>
<P>
   Baan competes against companies like the Oracle Corp. of the
United States and SAP AG of Germany, Europe's largest software
company, in producing software used to run corporate computer
networks.
</P>
<P>
   But Baan's business had declined dramatically, in part because
of past mismanagement and in part because of a general downturn
last year in the market for new corporate software.
</P>
<P>
   The company had labored mightily to portray Ms. Coleman, who is
44 and had sold her software company to Baan, as the person who
would engineer its turnaround and rebirth.
</P>
<P>
   Much like it did on Tuesday, the company took a huge
restructuring charge of $255 million one year ago. It then spent
$25 million on an advertising and promotional campaign to bolster
its image.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Coleman's efforts were badly hampered by a reluctance
among corporations to spend money on new computer systems while
they were still trying to fix Year 2000 computer problems.
</P>
<P>
   The company also lost scores of salespeople, particularly in the
United States. During the first nine months of 1999, sales declined
by 18 percent over the same period in 1998, to $491.4 million.
Losses during the first nine months climbed from $20.4 million in
1998 to $52.9 million.
</P>
<P>
   The downturn caught Baan at a bad time. In 1998, the company
became embroiled in allegations that it had manipulated its results
by routing sales through companies controlled by the company's two
founding brothers, Jan and Paul Baan.
</P>
<P>
   Company executives have denied any wrongdoing, but the company
was forced to take back $56 million in sales last year through this
so-called ``indirect channel.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, securities analysts pounded the company and
immediately reduced what they had already thought were pessimistic
earnings predictions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, we are advising rs to stay clear of this
stock right now,'' said Edwin Flick, an analyst at the Dutch
investment firm MeesPierson.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Belt, an analyst at the Dutch bank ABN Amro, said the
biggest danger facing Baan is a permanent loss of confidence in it
by large corporate customers. Customer confidence is crucial in
business software, because companies routinely spend tens of
millions of dollars on a system and then depend on the manufacturer
to provide maintenance and upgrades over many years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just imagine you are going to tell the chief executive that
you plan to spend about $30 million for a whole new system from a
company called Baan, and that he has been reading all these bad
articles about Baan,'' said Belt. ``You don't put your job on the
line for a purchase.''
</P>
<P>
   Belt reduced his earnings estimate for Baan from a profit of 1
cent a share in 2000 to a loss of 8 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Mooney, who became Baan's chief financial officer last
March, said he remains optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've taken some hard-nosed action to redirect those
efforts,'' Mooney told analysts and journalists during a telephone
conference on Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Under the newest plan for restructuring, he said, Baan will
focus its efforts on software for managing corporate business over
the Internet. Among the signs of a success, he said, was that
revenue from subscription licensing _ monthly fees that customers
pay to use Baan's software _ increased by half compared with the
quarter that ended in September.
</P>
<P>
   But that was not comforting to analysts, who noted that Baan's
licensing revenue had dropped by more than half in the third
quarter compared with the same period in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   According to Belt, moreover, 77 percent of Baan's sales are
coming from established customers, a sign that the company is
making very little inroads in signing up new customers.

CLINTONS' COMMUTER MARRIAGE BEGINS WEDNESDAY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ They've endured affairs, the empty-nest syndrome,
and an excruciating national debate over the state of their union.
And Wednesday, the Clintons will begin the country's most
high-profile commuter marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Two moving vans left from undisclosed locations in Washington
Tuesday to cart the belongings of Hillary Rodham Clinton to
Chappaqua, N.Y., the new base for her campaign for the US Senate
seat from New York.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton is scheduled to begin unpacking Wednesday in the
$1.7 million house the couple bought in November, spokeswoman Toby
Graff said. The Clintons paid for the move, she said.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton is expected to travel to Chappaqua late next
week to join his wife. He has said he would spend as much time
there as practicable in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been helping'' with the move, the president told
reporters Tuesday. ``We've been working at it. We've been boxing
things up and figuring out what to leave here, what to move there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a rather interesting challenge over the holidays,''
he added. ``But I've enjoyed it very much.''
</P>
<P>
   The move means the first family will be divided among three
locations _ the president in the White House, finishing his last
year in office; Mrs. Clinton in Chappaqua, trying to get elected to
office; and daughter Chelsea in California, where she is a junior
at Stanford University.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got something unique here'' for first families, said
William Leuchtenberg, a presidential scholar at the University of
North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly not a traditional White House family,'' said
Letitia Baldrige, who specializes in etiquette.
</P>
<P>
   But they are, in some ways, reflective of the typical American
family. In more than half of the country's 54.3 million married
couples, both adults work outside the home, according to the Census
Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   And while commuter marriages are hardly the norm, they appear to
be increasingly common; 7.3 million married people in the United
States were living away from their spouses in 1998, up from 6.7
million in 1994, the Census Bureau said. In 1985, there were 5.7
million married people in the United States living apart from their
spouses; in 1970, there were 4.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons' family dynamics are, for better or worse, a part
of Clinton's presidential legacy _ distasteful to some,
trailblazing to others.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton, who had a successful law practice before her
husband was elected president, made it clear during the 1992
campaign that she would not limit her White House duties to
hostessing. She drew criticism when she said she had not ``stayed
home and baked cookies and had teas'' when Clinton was governor of
Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   Others were irritated when Mrs. Clinton took a strong role in
the White House. The wives of the current Republican candidates
have emphasized that they would not get involved in policy-making
as Mrs. Clinton has done.
</P>
<P>
   While it has been many years since the typial American family
consisted of a working father, a stay-at-home mother, and two
children, the memory can be comforting, said Stephanie Coontz,
author of ``The Way We Never Were: American Families and the
Nostalgia Trap.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is all sorts of stress associated with a family that has
to take into account two whole (adult) lives, instead of one and a
quarter,'' Coontz said.
</P>
<P>
   Because of her move and her campaign, Mrs. Clinton is
``definitely scaling back all her first lady duties,'' but will
come to Washington for important events and to see her family, Graf
said.
</P>
<P>
   It is not yet determined where Chelsea will go on school
vacations.
</P>
<P>
   The 20-year-old student has grown from a shy child to a poised
young woman who is also a political asset to both her parents.
</P>
<P>
   When Chelsea was in Europe with the president in November, she
was a star attraction. Children in the Turkish city of Izmit
clamored to be near her, and in Kosovo, the welcome Chelsea got
from US troops was so enthusiastic that the president took the
unusual step of commenting on his daughter's celebrity.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the reception you gave my daughter, I thought you were
going to say I was Chelsea's father,'' Clinton quipped as he was
introduced to the soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton would benefit greatly from campaign appearances by
Chelsea, since it would enhance the candidate's image as a mother,
said Lee Miringoff, head of the Marist Institute of Public Opinion
based in Poughkeepsie, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   But the Clintons, who fiercely guard Chelsea's privacy, will not
discuss their daughter, and current and former aides, afraid of
angering the Clintons, refuse to answer any questions about
Chelsea.

WORD OF MOUTH GETS ACADEMY'S ATTENTION
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: with GRAMMY-MAIN) 
By FRED SHUSTER 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Star cameos on pop albums are a dime a dozen these
days, but there was clearly something special about the success of
Carlos Santana's ``Supernatural,'' which swept the Grammy Award
nominations Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The album enjoyed a unique synergy with a wide range of
listeners, many of whom heard the record for the first time over
the summer at barbecues and family events before radio of various
formats climbed aboard. In addition, the album makers revealed a
stroke of genius when they asked savvy singer Rob Thomas of
Matchbox 20 to convincingly sing the Latin-flavored smash hit
``Smooth,'' currently the No. 1 pop single in the country.
</P>
<P>
   The difference between ``Supernatural'' and so many similar
efforts to rope in a young and diverse audience was the
multigenerational choice of guest artists who collaborated with the
52-year-old rock guitarist, whose breakthrough came more than 30
years ago at the Woodstock Festival.
</P>
<P>
   The use of last year's Grammy smash Lauryn Hill, rap-rockers
Everlast, rock legend Eric Clapton, the seductively voiced
Eagle-Eye Cherry, hip-hopper Wyclef Jean and the widely popular
Dave Matthews ensured the record would get noticed. Added to that
sort of star power was a selection of top-notch songs, including
the irresistible ``Smooth,'' ``Put Your Lights On,'' ``Maria
Maria'' and ``Love of My Life.''
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, it's been a long time since record academy voters
took the venerable guitarist seriously even though his sweep of the
42nd annual nominations was widely predicted. ``Supernatural'' was
a shoo-in precisely because it was designed to appeal to the
biggest possible audience, a fact Grammy voters always note.
</P>
<P>
   The concept for the album, which connected Santana _ after years
of dwindling sales and fusion-tinged New Age noodling _ with a new
global audience, was conceived by Arista Records chief Clive Davis,
who first signed Santana to Columbia in the late '60s when he was
president of that label. The Grammy nods were vindication of sorts
for Davis, who is currently embroiled in a clash with the president
of Arista's parent company over Davis' retirement plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The word of mouth was the No. 1 thing on this album,'' Davis
said before the Grammy announcements.
</P>
<P>
   There must've been toasts all around at Santana's San Rafael
home, which he shares with his wife and kids.
</P>
<P>
   The Grammy nominations were also notable for one other thing _
the nomination of female jazz singer-pianist Diana Krall's ``When I
Look in Your Eyes'' for album of the year. Jazz albums by females,
which generally sell to a cult audience, rarely get noted in such
high-profile categories. However, the youthful Krall, an inventive
keyboardist, has had two albums in Billboard's jazz charts for many
months.
</P>
<P>
   An unusually heartening category this year was best new artist,
which included Van Nuys hip-hop/soul singer Macy Gray, Detroit
rap-metal clown Kid Rock and Boston blues diva Susan Tedeschi. All
three made well-received albums and put on entertaining local gigs
during the past 12 months. Also nominated were teen-pop thrushes
Christina Aguilera and Britney Spears.
</P>
<P>
   Although much was made of the Latin-pop explosion, the crossover
success of these artists was most evident in the best male
pop-vocal performance category, which pits Marc Anthony, Lou Bega,
Ricky Martin and Andrea Bocelli against each other and Sting.
</P>
<P>
   The country nods, too, showed promise. Among the five albums
nominated were such worthy contenders as the Dixie Chicks' ``Fly,''
George Jones' ``Cold Hard Truth'' and Alison Krauss' ``Forget About
It.''
</P>
<P>
   With an unprecedented 98 award categories, however, the Grammy
Awards have plainly become unwieldy even though many of the awards
are given out before the televised portion of the ceremony. The
movie academy, by comparison, hands out just 23 competitive awards,
less than a quarter of the statuettes the Grammy people hand out
each February.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, it often seems as though the entire music industry
is simply waiting to be called to the podium. The feeling at the
hours-long event is normally one of jovial backslapping, as if the
fix was in long before the limos started arriving and the only
suspense is which expensive champagne would be poured at the
after-party.
</P>
<P>
   The other complaint heard most often from Grammy watchers is the
lack of quality control in the awards. Among the truly memorable
albums released each year, very few get noticed by the record
academy. Last year, for example, some of the best records included
folk-rocker Julie Miller's ``Broken Things,'' Randy Newman's ``Bad
Love,'' Basement Jaxx's ``Remedy,'' Beth Orton's ``Central
Reservation,'' Keith Jarrett's ``The Melody at Night, With You''
and ``Return of the Grievous Angel: A Tribute to Gram Parsons.''
None received nods Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the great guitarist Jeff Beck got two nominations, Fatboy
Slim's ``Praise You'' was praised, and Beck's ``Mutations'' got a
nod, all in lesser categories.
</P>
<P>
   So despite some optimistic moments, the reaction to Tuesday's
nominations will probably be ``so what'' in some quarters _ but
certainly not in San Rafael. &QL;

ISRAEL, PALESTINIANS AGREE TO TALKS PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN DONNELLY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHEPHERDSTOWN, W. Va. _ After an opening day of nervousness and
discord in the Israeli-Syrian peace talks Monday, Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak and Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk Sharaa held
productive and rigorous talks Tuesday with the aid of President
Clinton and agreed to a work plan for the days ahead, US officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a work plan, an organizational structure. There's a
commitment to the work, and that's important'' after the procedural
hurdles that stalled talks on Monday, said State Department
spokesman James P. Rubin.
</P>
<P>
   The first day of talks in this hilltop college town about 70
miles northwest of Washington never really got started because of a
disagreement over what issue to address first, officials said.
Tuesday, American diplomats broke the deadlock by working out an
arrangement that allowed discussions to proceed simultaneously on
all fronts.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, bringing together the two leaders a day later than
originally planned, met with Barak and Sharaa for an hour.
Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright was the only other person
present.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too early to be worried,'' said a US administration
official, speaking on the condition of anonymity. ``They were
flying in here, nervous, not knowing what to expect, and they were
a little worked up. But that's over.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Helena Cobban, who has written extensively about the
earlier five years of Israeli-Syria peace negotiations: ``I
wouldn't worry too much about such an opening because the leaders
need to have that sense of drama and a sense of going right to the
wire. If they came to Shepherdstown and two days later, they came
out with an agreement, the public would wonder what's going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who arrived in a motorcade because foggy weather
grounded his helicopter, said before leaving Washington that both
leaders were ``very serious. I think they both want an agreement. I
think there are difficult issues, and we'll just have to hope that
we work it out.''
</P>
<P>
   He made his comments at an ceremony announcing his nomination of
Alan Greenspan to a fourth term as chairman of the Federal Reserve.
Comparing Greenspan's acceptance of another term to the
Israel-Syria negotiations, Clinton said, ``I wish I could have so
much success in the Middle East peace talks. I just ask them and
they say yes, the way Mr. Greenspan did. It would be joy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're looking at now up in West Virginia is sort of
figuring out what the process for the next few days is going to
be,'' the President said.
</P>
<P>
   The Israel-Syria talks, which broke up in 1996 with participants
saying then that about two-thirds of a deal had been worked out,
center on four main issues: Israel's return of the Golan Heights to
Syria, which lost the high plateau in the 1967 Six-Day War;
security guarantees; sharing water from the Sea of Galilee; and
normalization of relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin, the State Department spokesman, described the
Barak-Sharaa meeting as ``quite productive, comprehensive and a
rigorous discussion about where we are and where we need to get to
go. The leaders both reaffirmed their commitment to the process. .
. . We were quite pleased with how today unfolded in light of the
hurdles we had to get over last night.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubin, in a nearly hourlong news briefing, repeatedly talked
about the ups and downs of these types of negotiations, saying US
officials always expected difficulties. He said they had not
expected the battle over the agenda, but he added that there was no
sense of panic, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are proceeding apace. The officials in the talks were not
using Charles Dickens' ``Great Expectations'' as their book of the
day, and, . . . neither are they using Charles Dickens' ``Bleak
House'' as the book of the day,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The overnight disagreement was essentially over Syria's request
to talk first about the timing of an Israeli withdrawal from the
Golan Heights, and Israel's request to leave that issue for last.
</P>
<P>
   Breaking a news blackout on the talks, Israeli Cabinet Minister
Haim Ramon told Israel Radio that Barak wanted to resume the talks
where they broke off more than three years ago ``on the issue of
security, because the scope of a withdrawal depends on what we will
receive in return.''
</P>
<P>
   But Syria, according to US officials, first wanted to know about
the timetable for a pullback.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the agenda battle was resolved, it underscored the
difficulties in wresting an agreement from both sides, the US
official said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to get very serious, in a hurry, but there are a lot
of difficult issues out there, including for us when we start
talking about the bills there will be,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of the deal arose Tuesday when a reporter questioned
Clinton whether Israel had requested a reported $17 billion in aid
from the United States to accomplish the withdrawal from the Golan
Heights.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there will be some costs associated with the security
rearrangements, and then obviously over the long run, as I have
made clear, we need to make a contribution, as do our friends in
Europe and hopefully some in Asia, to the long-term economic
development of a regional Middle East economy,'' the president
said, adding that he had no specific numbers yet.

GRAMMYS GET `SUPERNATURAL' WITH SANTANA
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: with GRAMMY-ANALYSIS) 
By VALERIE KUKLENSKI 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Capping the success of his best-selling album in a
30-year career, fusion guitarist Carlos Santana received a whopping
nine Grammy nominations Tuesday, including record and album of the
year. His recording ``Smooth'' also garnered a song of the year nod
for writers Itaal Shur and Rob Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   The National Academy of Recording Arts &AMP; Sciences gave its
blessing to Santana's ``Supernatural'' album, a collaboration with
artists ranging from Eric Clapton to Everlast. Before the
nominations for the 42nd annual Grammy Awards, Santana had just
five nominations over his long career, and had won only one: best
rock instrumental in 1988 for ``Blues for Salvador.''
</P>
<P>
   The track ``Smooth,'' recorded with Thomas of the band Matchbox
20, is up for record of the year and best pop collaboration with
vocals. It will compete in that pop category against ``Love of My
Life,'' performed by Santana and Dave Matthews.
</P>
<P>
   Santana and rapper Everlast garnered a bid for best rock
performance by a duo or group with the vocal for ``Put Your Lights
On,'' and his guitar duet with Clapton, ``The Calling,'' has a shot
at best rock instrumental performance.
</P>
<P>
   The CD is up for album of the year and best rock album when the
Grammys are handed out Feb. 23 in ceremonies televised on CBS from
the Staples Center in downtown Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The 52-year-old Santana, whose San Francisco band had hits in
1970 with ``Evil Ways'' and ``Black Magic Woman,'' stole the
thunder from the rest of the field, making pop group TLC's seven
nominations pale by comparison.
</P>
<P>
   TLC is up for album of the year for ``FanMail,'' record of the
year for ``No Scrubs'' and best pop vocal performance by a duo or
group for ``Unpretty.'' The trio's nominations come amid a reported
feud between Lisa ``Left Eye'' Lopes and her colleagues, Rozanda
``Chilli'' Thomas and Tionne ``T-Boz'' Watkins, that has threatened
the stability of LaFace Records' most popular act.
</P>
<P>
   Chilli, who joined in the midmorning nominations announcement in
Beverly Hills, said, ``TLC is a hard-working group.''
</P>
<P>
   Conductor Pierre Boulez, past winner of 22 Grammys in classical
categories, chalked up another six nominations. Asleep at the Wheel
claimed five nominations, followed by four each for the Backstreet
Boys, the Dixie Chicks, Emmylou Harris, Whitney Houston and last
year's top winner, Lauryn Hill.
</P>
<P>
   The other record of the year contenders were wildly popular last
year with music buyers and disc jockeys alike: ``I Want It That
Way,'' by the Backstreet Boys; Cher's comeback hit, ``Believe'';
and ``Livin' La Vida Loca,'' by Ricky Martin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never have the nominations reflected so many different musical
points of view _ from the fanatically popular to those artists
whose influence and artistry speak with a unique and unheralded
resonance,'' said Michael Greene, president and chief executive
officer of the recording academy.
</P>
<P>
   He pointed to the album of the year category as a prime example.
Competing against Santana's guitar-laden ``Supernatural'' and TLC's
r&AMP;b grooving ``FanMail'' are ``Millennium,'' by the pop harmonizing
Backstreet Boys; ``Fly,'' by country's Dixie Chicks; and ``When I
Look in Your Eyes,'' by jazz singer Diana Krall.
</P>
<P>
   Santana and Martin, with three nominations, rode the popular
Latin music wave that marked 1999 and buoyed record sales for the
second year running. Latin-flavored tracks _ ``La Vida Loca''; ``I
Need to Know,'' by Marc Anthony; and ``Mambo No. 5 (A Little Bit Of
... ),'' by Lou Bega _ accounted for three of the five nominated
male pop-vocal performances.
</P>
<P>
   Nominees for best new artist are Christina Aguilera, Macy Gray,
Kid Rock, Britney Spears and Susan Tedeschi.
</P>
<P>
   Other contenders for song of the year, presented to writers,
include: ``I Want It That Way,'' by Andreas Carlsson and Max
Martin; ``Livin' La Vida Loca,'' by Desmond Child and Robi Rosa;
``Unpretty,'' by Dallas Austin and Tionne ``T-Boz'' Watkins; and
``You've Got a Way,'' by Robert John ``Mutt'' Lange and Shania
Twain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Millennium,'' ``Believe'' and ``Ricky Martin'' are up for best
pop album against ``Mirrorball'' by Sarah McLachlan and ``Brand New
Day'' by Sting.
</P>
<P>
   Santana's competition in the rock album category are:
``Breakdown'' by Melissa Etheridge, ``Significant Other'' by Limp
Bizkit, ``Echo'' by Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, and
``Californication'' by Red Hot Chili Peppers.
</P>
<P>
   Enimem's hot-selling ``The Slim Shady LP'' is up for best rap
album against ``Da Real World'' from Missy ``Misdemeanor'' Elliott,
``E.L.E. (Extinction Level Event _ The Final World Front)'' from
Busta Rhymes, ``I Am'' from Nas, and ``Things Fall Apart'' from the
Roots.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to album of the year, the Dixie Chicks' ``Fly'' was
nominated for best country album, along with ``Ride With Bob'' by
Asleep at the Wheel; ``Trio II'' by Emmylou Harris, Linda Ronstadt
and Dolly Parton; ``Cold Hard Truth'' by George Jones; and ``Forget
About It'' by Alison Krauss.
</P>
<P>
   This year Grammys will be presented in 98 categories, up from 95
last year. The great majority will be handed out in a dizzying pace
in ceremonies immediately preceding the prime-time telecast. New
additions include a category for best soundtrack album that
creatively compiles existing music and a redefined movie-TV
instrumental category that encompassed music written for video
games or the Internet.!end! &QL;

CLINTON NOMINATES GREENSPAN TO STAY ON AS FED CHAIRMAN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With the nation poised to enter the longest period
of economic expansion in US history, President Clinton extended the
job Tuesday of the man he credits with guiding the economic
success: Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan.
</P>
<P>
   The 73-year-old Greenspan has displayed ``a rare combination of
technical expertise, sophisticated analysis and old-fashioned
common sense,'' Clinton said as he nominated Greenspan, as
expected, to a fourth, four-year term. ``His wise and steady
leadership has inspired confidence, not only here in America but
around the world.''
</P>
<P>
   In a city whose fabled motto is ``if you want a friend in
Washington, get a dog,'' Greenspan is almost universally liked and
respected. The Senate has approved Greenspan's nomination eagerly
in the past and is expected to confirm the pending renomination
easily.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been thinking about taking `alan.com' public; then we
could pay the debt off even before 2015,'' Clinton quipped.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan said the challenge of applying theories to the
marketplace discouraged him from taking retirement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like eating peanuts. You keep doing it, keep doing it,
and you never get tired, because the future is always unknowable,''
Greenspan said.
</P>
<P>
   As chairman of the Fed, Greenspan and the Fed board are
responsible for setting interest rates that affect homebuyers.
Since interest rates are a key factor in the performance of the
stock market, stockholders are also affected by Greenspan's
decisions.
</P>
<P>
   About half of American households have some connection to the
stock market, either because people trade on the market or have
pension funds that are invested in mutual funds, said Rosanne Cahn,
chief equities economist at Credit Suisse First Boston in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market Tuesday fell 359 points, a dramatic drop. But
the decline in the Dow was ``not an adverse reaction to Alan
Greenspan's reappointment,'' said Frederick Breimyer, chief
economist for State Street Bank and Trust in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The drop was mainly due to expectations that the Fed will raise
interest rates in February, Breimyer explained.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the plunge in the stock market on the day of the
Greenspan announcement ``also says his reappointment itself is not
going to send the stock market up, either,'' Breimyer said.
</P>
<P>
   Both Republican and Democratic leaders on Capitol Hill praised
Clinton's decision to renominate Greenspan, who has served for 12
years under the administrations of Presidents Reagan, Bush and
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have heard nothing from my colleagues, which would indicate
that there would be any problem with his Senate confirmation,''
said Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street is also fond of the man who has presided over a
remarkable era of economic growth. While fiscal analysts give
Greenspan credit for adjusting interest rates appropriately to keep
the economy humming, they note he has also benefited from being in
the right place at the right time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just like the president of the United States, he gets credit
when it's good, and blame if it's bad,'' Cahn said.
</P>
<P>
   The country is in its longest peacetime expansion, and in a few
weeks, will be in its longest period of growth ever, according to
forecasts by the Office of Management and Budget.
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment is 4.1 percent, the lowest in 30 years, and the
federal deficit is on track to be eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan's renomination lends a sense of stability not only to
the financial services industry, but also to the presidential
contenders.
</P>
<P>
   The leading candidates' economic plans have largely been based
on the presumption that the economy will continue to prosper.
</P>
<P>
   Economists do not believe that the nation will enter a recession
this year, Cahn and others said, but naturally there are no
guarantees.
</P>
<P>
   On the issue of Greenspan, the presidential candidates are
almost entirely _ and uncharacteristically _ in agreement. And the
performance of the bespectacled, unassuming man could have an
enormous impact on the outcome of the election, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans George W. Bush, the Texas governor, and Senator John
McCain of Arizona back the Fed chairman, as do the Democratic
contenders, Vice President Al Gore and former Senator Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have long urged President Clinton to reappoint Alan
Greenspan, and so I applaud the decision'' Bush said in a
statement. ``Chairman Greenspan's strong leadership is good for the
country and good for our economy.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain has already committed to Greenspan. ``I would not only
reappoint Mr. Greenspan,'' McCain joked during a New Hampshire
debate in December, ``if Mr. Greenspan were to die, God forbid, I
would do like the movie `Weekend at Bernie's' and stuff him and
prop him up.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican candidate Steve Forbes has expressed misgivings about
Greenspan, saying he would have a ``heart-to-heart'' talk with the
Fed chairman about his economic policies before considering
renominating him.
</P>
<P>
   For the Democrats, Greenspan's performance at the Fed could be
critical. If the economy takes a dive, Democrats could no longer
boast about their party's performance on the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's ambitious health-care plan ``would bankrupt the
country unless the economy continues to be strong,'' Cahn said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, meanwhile, would suffer by his personal association with
the administration in power.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Gore were elected in 1992 in large part because
unemployment was more than 7 percent, noted Jeff Faux, president of
the Economic Policy Institute in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was `the economy, stupid' then, and it's `the economy,
stupid' now,'' said Faux, referring to a Clinton-Gore 1992 campaign
slogan.
</P>
<P>
   ``If prosperity does go down, the Republicans' chances of
electing a president go up,'' Faux said. ``But for the Democrats,
their future relies on the economy and, to some degree, what
Greenspan is going to do.''

CORPORATIONS RECOGNIZE GROWING VALUE OF TECHNICAL SUPPORT WORKERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Conn., Fla.)   (bl)  
 By DAVID LEONHARDT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The managers of Phoenix Home Life Mutual Insurance Co.'s Chicago
office know how to butter up the corporate VIPs. As a holiday gift,
they flew a quartet of jazz singers to the Hartford, Conn.,
headquarters in December to parade around in Mickey Mouse sweaters
and sing Christmas carols to the people who hold real power over
their professional lives.
</P>
<P>
   The quartet sang for the board of directors, of course. But they
also made a special, 25-minute stop in a nondescript room of
cubicles to sing for a group that the Chicago managers wanted to
please as much as anybody else: the computer help-desk staff.
</P>
<P>
   When the foursome had finished with ``O Holy Night'' (a favorite
of the man who answers the help desk's phone, they had heard),
``Silent Night'' and ``We Wish You a Merry Christmas,'' it seemed
clear that the effort at ingratiation had worked: The woman who
runs the help desk was crying.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when millions of white-collar workers depend on a
desktop computer to perform virtually every function of their job,
computer help-desk technicians are fast achieving a position of
unofficial influence that rivals that held by the office secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Given how frequently office computer networks break down, it is
technology support workers who often decide whether people must sit
stewing unproductively for hours or whether a software bug is just
a minor nuisance. As a result, staying in the good graces of the
help desk _ and figuring out which of its members are truly helpful
_ has become a delicate science for many of the nation's office
workers.
</P>
<P>
   The help desk's phone number is usually one of the few that
virtually all company employees know by heart. Some executives have
forged a friendship with a technology staffer they hope will become
their personal computer consultant. And, like the managers at
Phoenix Home Life, employees at all levels are using gifts to curry
favor with computer techies _ or perhaps make up for screaming at
them in a moment of frustration.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, behind all of the flattery is a serious issue, computer
industry experts say: There are still too few help-desk technicians
across the country. Some 250,000 and 300,000 employees currently
fit the description of internal technology support staff, up from
about 100,000 in 1992, according to Howard Rubin, the chairman of
the computer science department at Hunter College in New York. They
typically are paid about $25,000-$50,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last month, as relief over the lack of Year 2000
computer problems has followed the gift-giving of the December
holidays, help-desk workers across the country have been bombarded
with homemade cookies, chocolate samplers, fancy lunches and
thank-you notes that are carbon-copied to key executives.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   At PricewaterhouseCoopers in New York, help-desk workers have
filled a wall with appreciative e-mails recounting their triumphs.
At the insurance company Marsh USA, word has gotten around that
tech workers in Memphis like salsa and chips, and orders have been
arriving from a nearby Mexican restaurant. And at Burson
Marsteller, the New York public relations firm and a unit of Young
&AMP; Rubicam Inc., the chief financial officer is planning to take out
the entire help desk for lunch at Angelo &AMP; Maxies, an upscale
steakhouse, to celebrate the trouble-free year-2000 changeover.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``We think computer systems have gotten easier,'' said Professor
Paul Danos, the dean of the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth.
``But the networks have gotten so complex that you can't do
anything for yourself anymore. You need to get someone to help you.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are usually a handful of people,'' Danos added,
referring to help-desk employees, ``who could really bring an
organization to its knees.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite a growing recognition of the importance of help-desk
workers, the increase in their ranks has not kept pace with the
explosion of computer troubles that have accompanied the growth of
office PCs, internal corporate Web sites and complicated
cybernetworks. In the last four years, the number of calls to help
desks around the country has been increasing by about 20 percent a
year, said Kris Brittain, a research director at GartnerGroup, a
consulting firm in Stamford, Conn. And with unemployment low,
technically savvy help-desk workers are in strong demand,
particularly by nternet start-ups that can offer stock options.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the shortages, computer users at large companies
must often hold for minutes before their calls are answered and
even wait hours to have their troubles fixed.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   More than 11 percent of all calls to help desks at large
companies are abandoned, according to GartnerGroup. On average,
callers wait about 53 seconds before hearing a human voice, the
firm said.
</P>
<P>
   To deal with the overload, many companies have begun asking
employees to describe their problems in e-mail messages (assuming
that the e-mail system is functioning), rather than by calling.
</P>
<P>
   Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Florida is typical. Its help desk
in Jacksonville has grown from 8 employees to 23 in the last
decade, said Anna Guy, who oversees it. But with about 24,000 phone
calls coming in every month, it remains understaffed, and it is not
coming close to meeting its goal of answering every call within 30
seconds, Ms. Guy said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're short on staff,'' she said. ``We're in a slump.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   An overworked help desk that must tend to more urgent requests
first and keep everybody else waiting is, of course, an inevitable
target of office apple-polishers. Recently, Ms. Guy and every
member of her staff received a road atlas from the marketing
department, which for the last two years has not had a secretary
and now relies on the help desk for many more tasks. Another group
of employees drove 20 minutes across Jacksonville to deliver a box
of Whitman's chocolates.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted to go around and meet every single person on the
help desk,'' Ms. Guy said. ``Obviously, your human nature is that
when someone is nice to you, you're nice to them back.''
</P>
<P>
   That is especially the case for technology-support workers, who
spend their days talking to callers made angry by both computer
problems and help-desk delays. The waits only aggravate their
frustration, office workers said, causing technology support
workers to receive some of worst verbal abuse in Corporate America.
</P>
<P>
   ``Help desks are a pretty tough environment,'' said Rushdi
Ariss, the information technology manager for C.A. Rasmussen, a
construction company in Simi Valley, Calif., where help-desk
workers received both sweets and thank-you cards in December. ``Not
a lot of people are courteous'' when they call, he said, and
partially as a result, most help-desk workers quit or change jobs
in 18 months or less.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The abuse is another reason for all of the gifts of the last
month. ``I may not be the nicest person'' to the help desk
sometimes, acknowledged Rhet O'Neill, one of the managers of the
Chicago office of Phoenix Home Life. She doubles as a member of the
quartet that sang in Connecticut in December. So, Ms. O'Neill said,
she wanted to make sure that the help desk understood she did
appreciate their work.
</P>
<P>
   ``You become important to them,'' she said, of meeting the
support workers in person, ``and therefore your problems become
important to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Many executives have another strategy: They skip the help desk
and call a technology worker whose fix-it skills they revere and
whose number, likely as not, they keep hidden away from their
colleagues as though it were a state secret.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At Towers Perrin, a management-consulting firm with 8,500
employees, everybody is supposed to start with the help desk for
all problems. But some top executives, like the chief information
officer, find a favorite ``level two'' technology expert they then
call directly, said Steve Stull, the director of office technology
and services. That allows them to avoid the help-desk lines and
help-desk workers who might not recognize their names.
</P>
<P>
   ``Often,'' Stull said, ``the younger people haven't been around
the firm very long, so they don't even know who the senior
executives are when they call in.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, a generous gift can get their attention rather
quickly. The 10 members of Burson Marsteller's help desk, for
example, are unlikely to forget that for all of the obsequious
e-mail, fancy fruit baskets and succulent chocolates that they
received last year, it was chief financial officer Kurt Krauss who
took them out to a steak lunch.
</P>
<P>
   That is, if they all actually made it through the meal. The help
desk manager deliberately picked a restaurant on the same block as
Burson's headquarters. The workers, he realized, were too important
all to be far away from the office at the same time.

CLINTONS' COMMUTER MARRIAGE BEGINS WEDNESDAY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ They've endured affairs, the empty-nest syndrome,
and an excruciating national debate over the state of their union.
And Wednesday, the Clintons will begin the country's most
high-profile commuter marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Two moving vans left from undisclosed locations in Washington
Tuesday to cart the belongings of Hillary Rodham Clinton to
Chappaqua, N.Y., the new base for her campaign for the US Senate
seat from New York.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton is scheduled to begin unpacking Wednesday in the
$1.7 million house the couple bought in November, spokeswoman Toby
Graff said. The Clintons paid for the move, she said.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton is expected to travel to Chappaqua late next
week to join his wife. He has said he would spend as much time
there as practicable in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been helping'' with the move, the president told
reporters Tuesday. ``We've been working at it. We've been boxing
things up and figuring out what to leave here, what to move there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a rather interesting challenge over the holidays,''
he added. ``But I've enjoyed it very much.''
</P>
<P>
   The move means the first family will be divided among three
locations _ the president in the White House, finishing his last
year in office; Mrs. Clinton in Chappaqua, trying to get elected to
office; and daughter Chelsea in California, where she is a junior
at Stanford University.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got something unique here'' for first families, said
William Leuchtenberg, a presidential scholar at the University of
North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly not a traditional White House family,'' said
Letitia Baldrige, who specializes in etiquette.
</P>
<P>
   But they are, in some ways, reflective of the typical American
family. In more than half of the country's 54.3 million married
couples, both adults work outside the home, according to the Census
Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   And while commuter marriages are hardly the norm, they appear to
be increasingly common; 7.3 million married people in the United
States were living away from their spouses in 1998, up from 6.7
million in 1994, the Census Bureau said. In 1985, there were 5.7
million married people in the United States living apart from their
spouses; in 1970, there were 4.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons' family dynamics are, for better or worse, a part
of Clinton's presidential legacy _ distasteful to some,
trailblazing to others.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton, who had a successful law practice before her
husband was elected president, made it clear during the 1992
campaign that she would not limit her White House duties to
hostessing. She drew criticism when she said she had not ``stayed
home and baked cookies and had teas'' when Clinton was governor of
Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   Others were irritated when Mrs. Clinton took a strong role in
the White House. The wives of the current Republican candidates
have emphasized that they would not get involved in policy-making
as Mrs. Clinton has done.
</P>
<P>
   While it has been many years since the typial American family
consisted of a working father, a stay-at-home mother, and two
children, the memory can be comforting, said Stephanie Coontz,
author of ``The Way We Never Were: American Families and the
Nostalgia Trap.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is all sorts of stress associated with a family that has
to take into account two whole (adult) lives, instead of one and a
quarter,'' Coontz said.
</P>
<P>
   Because of her move and her campaign, Mrs. Clinton is
``definitely scaling back all her first lady duties,'' but will
come to Washington for important events and to see her family, Graf
said.
</P>
<P>
   It is not yet determined where Chelsea will go on school
vacations.
</P>
<P>
   The 20-year-old student has grown from a shy child to a poised
young woman who is also a political asset to both her parents.
</P>
<P>
   When Chelsea was in Europe with the president in November, she
was a star attraction. Children in the Turkish city of Izmit
clamored to be near her, and in Kosovo, the welcome Chelsea got
from US troops was so enthusiastic that the president took the
unusual step of commenting on his daughter's celebrity.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the reception you gave my daughter, I thought you were
going to say I was Chelsea's father,'' Clinton quipped as he was
introduced to the soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton would benefit greatly from campaign appearances by
Chelsea, since it would enhance the candidate's image as a mother,
said Lee Miringoff, head of the Marist Institute of Public Opinion
based in Poughkeepsie, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   But the Clintons, who fiercely guard Chelsea's privacy, will not
discuss their daughter, and current and former aides, afraid of
angering the Clintons, refuse to answer any questions about
Chelsea.

 &HT;    CLINTON JUMPSTARTS ISRAEL, SYRIA TALKS WITH FACE-TO-FACE MEETING
 &HT;    (900&AMP;ADD)
 &HT;    With ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS-0105.

<P>
   SHEPHERDSTOWN, W.Va. _ President Clinton led Israeli and Syrian
negotiators in face-to-face discussions on Tuesday, breaking a
tense psychological barrier between the long-standing foes and
setting the stage for formal peace talks to begin here in earnest
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Syrian Foreign Minister
Farouk al-Sharaa spoke for only an hour behind closed doors, with
Clinton and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright sitting in as a
tempering influence.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, it was the first direct meeting the two men have had
since arriving here early Monday for talks aimed at ending five
decades of enmity and bloodshed between the Mideastern neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Barak and Sharaa agreed that committees of Israeli, Syrian and
U.S. experts would divvy up a contentious list of territorial,
security, economic and other issues and begin working to narrow
their differences over each area in talks expected to continue at
least into the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the issues are on the table, and it's a pretty full table,
as you might imagine,'' Clinton told reporters in the Oval Office
before traveling by motorcade the 65 miles from the White House to
this rustic hamlet on the mist-shrouded banks of the Potomac River.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also made clear that peace between Israel and Syria
would carry a price tag for the United States, and, likely, for
Europe and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there will be some cost associated with the security
re-arrangements,'' Clinton said, referring to the prospect of
Israeli withdrawal from the strategic Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
   Further, Clinton said, ``we need to make a contribution _ as do
our friends in Europe and hopefully Asia _ to the long-term
economic development of a regional Middle East economy. We're
trying to determine exactly what that should be.''
</P>
<P>
   Those discussions are central to the peace talks here this week.
Under any agreement, Clinton would likely be expected to ask
Congress to approve billions of dollars in military, economic and
humanitarian aid over several years to Israel and Syria.
</P>
<P>
   And U.S. troops could be deployed as part of a larger
peacekeeping contingent to help secure the Golan Heights, which
Israel seized from Syria during the 1967 Middle East War.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli press has widely reported that Barak has asked
Clinton for up to $17 billion in aid to Israel, part of which would
be used to help pay for the costs of moving roughly 17,000 Israelis
who have settled in the Golan territories over the past three
decades.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton declined to confirm those reports, but he made clear
that the U.S. contribution needs to be substantial.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to have a high probability of success,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The second day of talks also brought out protesters from
Brooklyn, N.Y. _ about 40 of them, led by Orthodox Jews who oppose
the proposed Israeli turnover of the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Golan is our security,'' said protest leader Levi Huebner.
``Peace will be in security and trust in our neighbors.''
</P>
<P>
   In Israel, 20 rabbis linked to the Jewish settlement movement
ruled that the Golan Heights are part of biblical Israel and that
Israeli communities cannot be removed from the territory.
</P>
<P>
   While Israel's secular majority does not follow rabbinical
strictures, the ruling may make it more difficult for Barak to get
a land-for-peace agreement approved in a national referendum.
</P>
<P>
   In Damascus, meanwhile, the state-run Syria Times said a ``deep
freeze'' could follow if the West Virginia talks are not
successful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless there is a breakthrough very soon, the whole process
for making peace will come to a dangerous recess,'' the
English-language daily said. ``Until the Israelis summon the
courage to move forward, no real breakthrough is likely to occur.''
</P>
<P>
   Hopes were lifted here after Clinton hosted the trilateral
meeting between Barak and Sharaa. Divisions between the two men
over how to structure the peace talks here had forced Clinton to
scrap a direct meeting of the two men the day before.
</P>
<P>
   While the meeting was more conversational than substantive,
administration officials heaved a sigh of relief when it finally
took place Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a comprehensive and rigorous discussion of where we are
and where we need to get to,'' State Department spokesman James
Rubin told reporters shortly after the meeting. ``It was a very
constructive and productive session that put the process clearly on
track.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to build momentum, Clinton hosted Barak and Sharaa
shortly afterwards for an informal reception at the secluded
Clarion Hotel and Conference Center where the earlier meeting was
held.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin said the reception was meant to be more social than
diplomatic, a sort of ice-breaker for the negotiating teams that
are poised for lengthy and exhaustive rhetorical combat in the days
ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like they're going to the ballet,'' Rubin said of the
reception, ``but it won't involve sitting around the table with
pads and notetakers.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was scheduled to return to the White House later Tuesday
night, leaving Albright to shepherd the talks. White House
spokesman Joseph Lockhart said, though, the president would likely
return to the talks later this week.
</P>
<P>
   The Shepherdstown negotiations are the first round of
Israeli-Syrian peace talks in nearly four years.
</P>
<P>
   The session is centered on a plan under which Israel would
return the Golan Heights to Syrian control in exchange for security
guarantees from Syria. Also in the mix are the terms under which
Syria and Israel would establish the first full diplomatic and
commercial ties since Israel's founding in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials have stressed that they don't expect the
Shepherdstown round to fully resolve the Israeli-Syrian conflict.
The hope is, though, that these talks _ which could go on for
another week or longer _ would set the table for a conclusive round
later this year.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is making a full-court press to try to broker a
comprehensive Mideast peace accord before he leaves office a year
from now. Resolving the Israeli-Syrian conflict is a vital piece of
the larger puzzle. It is also the key to resolving a separate set
of security and territorial disputes between Israel and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   On a separate track, Clinton is trying to help broker peace
between Barak and Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   That portion of the Mideast peace effort saw substantial
progress on Tuesday, when Israel agreed to withdraw additional
troops from 5 percent of the occupied West Bank of the Jordan
River, and place those portions under Palestinian control.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat and Barak have agreed to hammer out a framework by
mid-February for settling the so-called ``final status'' issues
remaining between their two peoples, including the future of
Jerusalem and the question of Palestinian statehood. Both men have
agreed to complete final status negotiations by October.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and his foreign policy team are pressing to bring those
varied components of a larger Mideast peace together by then, a
goal he reiterated on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans of all political parties and all stripes desperately
want us to see a comprehensive peace in the Middle East,'' Clinton
said. ``In the next three or four months we have an unparalleled
opportunity that we have to seize, so I'm quite hopeful about
that.''

WEST BANK LAND DEAL PAVES WAY FOR ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN PEACE TALKS 

</HEADLINE>

c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Israeli and Palestinian negotiators ended a
seven-week deadlock Tuesday by agreeing to put another 5 percent of
West Bank territory under Palestinian control by Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, which cleared the way for the sides to begin talks on
a final peace treaty, defined the West Bank lands that Israel will
give to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiators also reaffirmed Israel's commitment to hand over
an additional 6.1 percent of the West Bank by Jan. 20. On that
date, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat will assume full or partial
control of more than 43 percent of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, a procedural snag that held up parallel
peace negotiations between Israel and Syria was removed Tuesday,
and President Clinton rejoined the talks, meeting for more than an
hour in Shepherdstown, W.Va., with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak and Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa.
</P>
<P>
   State Department spokesman James Rubin, offering few details,
declined to say how a dispute over the agenda was resolved. But he
did say that the Israelis and Syrians had formed committees to take
up key issues, an indication that the talks were proceeding.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters in Gaza City, Arafat called the West Bank
withdrawal deal ``a step toward the implementation of what we
agreed upon'' at the Egyptian resort town of Sharm el-Sheikh in
September.
</P>
<P>
   The 5 percent withdrawal, a provision of the Sharm el-Sheikh
accord, was to have taken place in November. But the Israelis held
it up after the Palestinians complained that Israel was dictating
which West Bank areas would be handed over without consultations.
</P>
<P>
   After Tuesday's meeting, neither Palestinian negotiator Saeb
Erekat nor Israeli Oded Eran would say how the impasse had been
overcome. But it is likely that a secret late-night meeting held
last month between Arafat and Barak set the groundwork for
Tuesday's step forward.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters, Erekat said only that ``Mr. Barak and
President Arafat are very well aware of the understanding, and they
mandated us to conclude this understanding.''
</P>
<P>
   Eran said only that the agreement reached Tuesday ``is
satisfactory to both of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians have been concerned that their negotiations with
the Israelis would be overshadowed by the Israeli-Syrian talks,
which reopened in December after nearly four years of stalemate.
</P>
<P>
   The issues dividing the Israelis and Syrians are considered less
complicated than those separating Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Barak has added urgency to the Syrian track by
promising to pull troops out of a self-declared ``security zone''
in southern Lebanon by July. Israeli forces have been battling
Syrian-backed guerrillas in the zone, and Damascus wields great
influence over the Beirut government because, in part, it has kept
thousands of ground troops in Lebanon since 1976.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Israeli-Syrian talks began in December, Israel has
tried to reassure the Palestinians that the two separate
negotiations can go on simultaneously. But some Israeli analysts
remain skeptical that both tracks could move ahead at the same
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today is a sign that they can progress slowly on both at the
same time,'' said Reuven Hazan, a political analyst at Jerusalem's
Hebrew University.
</P>
<P>
   ``But reaching an agreement on both that will require national
referendums and uproot (people) and deal with issues such as
Jerusalem. I don't think it's impossible, but putting them together
is increasing the chance of failure,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian analysts said that despite the deal on the West Bank
lands reached Tuesday, they suspected that their negotiators
remained concerned about being sidetracked. The analysts suggested
that such worries may have made the Palestinians more willing to
offer concessions.
</P>
<P>
   ``In light of the possible breakthrough with Syria, it seems the
Palestinians have become worried and settled for the unacceptable
in order not to be left behind,'' said Ghassan Khatib, a
Palestinian political analyst who directs the Jerusalem Media and
Communications Center.
</P>
<P>
   In November, the Palestinians had refused the West Bank
withdrawal maps because the lands defined by the Israelis were too
sparsely populated and disconnected from areas already under
Palestinian control.
</P>
<P>
   It was not known how, or even whether, those maps were changed
to elicit Palestinian acceptance.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators have given themselves until Feb. 13 to come up with
a framework for a final peace agreement. Such an accord will
include such emotional topics as the future of Jerusalem, the fate
of millions of Palestinian refugees, the status of Jewish
settlements in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, and the shape of
the final borders between the Israelis and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides hope to sign a peace treaty by September.

TURNER AND FONDA COMMIT TO MARRIAGE AND SEPARATION
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: This story also moved in the ``a'' national news file)  
 By LEAH GARCHIK  
 c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   In keeping with national role models _  &UR; Hillary Clinton &LR;  moved
out of the White House Tuesday _ actress/activist/exercise queen
 &UR; Jane Fonda &LR; , 62, and billionaire media mogul  &UR; Ted Turner &LR; , 61, have
announced that they are separating. The couple, who have seven
children between them (five of his, two of hers) marked their eight
anniversary on December 21.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we continue to be committed to the long-term success of
our marriage, we find ourselves at a juncture where we must each
take some personal time for ourselves,'' said a statement issued by
both. ``Therefore, we have mutually decided to spend some time
apart. We ask that you respect this decision.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement was an eerie echo of one issued 11 years ago,
about a pair The Chronicle called ``the quintessential couple of
the Hollywood liberal set'': `` &UR; Tom Hayden  &LR; and  &UR; Jane Fonda &LR;  have
decided to separate on a trial basis. Tom and Jane consider this a
private matter and will have no public comment or statement on
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The height of Fonda's personal success came from a career as an
exercise and fitness guru who had breast implant surgery and
encouraged other women to be happy in their bodies. The height of
her national notoriety came when she criticized the United States
during a trip to Hanoi.
</P>
<P>
   But she was best known, as the wife of men _ French filmmaker
 &UR; Roger Vadim &LR;  before Hayden before Turner _ for being all things to
all of them. She was a sex kitten for Vadim, who made movies about
sex kittens, and a political activist for Hayden, who made a career
as a politician.
</P>
<P>
   After her marriage to Turner, she learned the Tomahawk Chop to
sit beside him during playoff games of his Atlanta Braves. In 1992,
in the course of promoting her 16th video, ``Jane Fonda's Step
Aerobic and Abdominal Workout,'' she announced she was dropping her
movie career to focus on the marriage. ``Life is more interesting
than a movie right now,'' she said. The couple took shooting
lessons together, and bought a large portion of the state of
Montana, where they raised buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1996 interview after speaking at UC Berkeley, Turner, who
had been married twice before, said his life had been changed by
his marriage to Fonda. ``I've become more of a listener and I'm
easier to get along with. I married somebody who's absolutely my
equal. ... I'm used to being told what to do.''
</P>
<P>
   At the web site for CNN, the news network founded by Turner, a
short story about the couple's decision was linked to three stories
about the mogul's personal importance, including Turner's not
surprising listing in CNN's own ranking of the top business icons
of the 20th century and a 1997 announcement of his donation of $1
billion to U.N. causes.
</P>
<P>
   Turner had told the media at the time that when he informed his
wife he was making the donation, ``It brought tears to her eyes.
She said, `I'm proud to be married to you.' '' Later that year,
Turner told the New York Post that he made love to her three times
a day.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; CONSUMER ALERT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Self magazine warns of the danger of counterfeit aromatherapy
candles.
</P>
<P>
   These fakes are purported to use essential oils but ``actually
use cheaper, easier-to-mix (and possibly less effective) synthetic
blends.'' But how's an innocent consumer to know? Look for candles
carrying the ``Certified Aromatherapy Product Seal.
</P>
<P>
   And Sebastian International, which makes beauty products, has
sent an alert warning of counterfeit cans of its Shaper hair spray,
which are ``prone to clogging as they are filled with a cheap and
adulterated imitation of the revolutionary and proprietary Shaper
hairspray formula. ... A federal investigation is underway.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WHO SAID WHAT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1997, when I sang for President Clinton, I'll never forget
him stumbling across chairs to get a better look, with Hillary
saying, `What is he looking at that's special?' He was the first
president I ever met, and he sang `Be My Baby' to me. ... He was
really nice, just a flirt.''
</P>
<P>
   _ &LR;   &LR; Ronnie Spector, former lead singer of the Ronettes, whose
big hit, in the early '60s, was ``Be My Baby,'' in Vibe magazine.
MSNBC reports that at the White House millennium ball, the
president danced with Chelsea Clinton's former Sidwell Friends
school pals _ but not to worry, he wasn't slow-dancing with them.

BELICHICK STUNNER ECLIPSES PATRIOTS' QUIET DAY OF DEPARTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ A very quiet day of coaches and players
clearing out their belongings from Foxboro Stadium turned into what
could be another major cold war between the Patriots and the New
York Jets.
</P>
<P>
   Patriots personnel were glued to TVs and radio, listening to
Bill Belichick's every word. One Patriot type growled, ``They're
more (messed up) than we are.''
</P>
<P>
   This has all the makings of the reverse of Bill Parcells's messy
departure from New England three years ago, but this time it
involves Parcells's able assistant Belichick, who abruptly resigned
as Jets head coach only a day after being announced as Parcells's
contractual successor.
</P>
<P>
   Belichick, who shocked the Jets with the decision and then
conducted a lengthy press conference, cited the uncertainty of the
team's impending ownership change as the underlying reason why he
wanted out. But the implication was clear: Belichick wants to
pursue a job as coach and general manager of the Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   Owner Robert Kraft said he would not answer any questions on
Belichick's announcement, and other Patriots officials were mum as
well.
</P>
<P>
   Belichick's status is expected to be decided by the league
office, and while the Patriots may wait for that decision, they
pursued other head coaching candidates Tuesday, and they will
interview Oakland Raiders defensive coordinator Willie Shaw
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Denver offensive coordinator Gary Kubiak took himself out of the
running for the Patriots job when he declined an interview, citing
family reasons for not wanting to leave.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have talked with the Patriots via telephone and we had a
great conversation,'' said Kubiak. ``I am not going to New England
for an interview. I appreciate being contacted and considered. It's
very flattering, but for a number of personal reasons I will not be
a candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacksonville's Dom Capers, St. Louis's Mike Martz, and possibly
Marty Schottenheimer are other possible choices. There's also
speculation that the Patriots are interested in Wisconsin coach
Barry Alvarez and University of Miami coach Butch Davis.
</P>
<P>
   The same people appear to be on Ron Wolf's list of candidates to
succeed Ray Rhodes in Green Bay. The Packers also would want a shot
at Belichick if he were available.
</P>
<P>
   The problem for the Patriots is that if they can't get Belichick
out of his contract with the Jets through compensation, they will
compete with the Jets and Green Bay for a tiny pool of candidates.
</P>
<P>
   There is also speculation that coaching vacancies could occur in
Pittsburgh, as Bill Cowher is said to be considering a college job
(perhaps North Carolina State), and Miami, as Jimmy Johnson could
resign when the season ends.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City Chiefs spokesman Bob Moore said Tuesday that the
Patriots had not spoken to them about releasing Schottenheimer from
the final year of his contract. The Patriots would have to ask for
such permission despite the fact that Schottenheimer is an ESPN
analyst and very happy in that role, according to a friend of
Schottenheimer's. The friend, who asked not to be named, said it
was ``far-fetched'' that Schottenheimer would want to return to
coaching this soon.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots have asked permission to speak to Capers and Martz
after their teams' seasons have ended. Capers, the Jaguars'
defensive coordinator, has been a head coach with the Carolina
Panthers and brought them to the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots could wait on Belichick and name an interim head
coach, possibly an in-house candidate such as defensive coordinator
Steve Sidwell, who is still under contract.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Kennan, the former Patriots offensive coordinator who is
now president of the NFL Coaches Association, has been fielding
calls from Patriots assistants who have questions about their
contracts.
</P>
<P>
   According to Kennan, while all of them have another year left on
their deals, they will not be credited with pension time if they
are not retained, even though they will get paid.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lousy situation,'' said Kennan, ``which is why we have
put our organization together so we can fight these issues in the
future.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennan said the Patriots would be well-served by naming Sidwell
head coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sidwell would be a great choice,'' said Kennan. ``He has the
respect of the players and the coaches. If you're going to go out
and hire a coordinator from another team, why not just hire the guy
you have right there? I can't imagine anyone being as qualified as
Sid in running a football team.''
</P>
<P>
   In an informal poll of eight Patriot players late in the season,
Belichick was a unanimous choice to succeed Pete Carroll in the
event of a firing. Having Belichick would also help the Patriots
sign Lawyer Milloy, who is a big fan of Belichick's. Patriots
cornerback Ty Law said Monday that he had planned to speak to
Belichick about considering the Patriots job.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill understands this team as well as anyone,'' said Patriots
wide receiver Shawn Jefferson. ``He knows the key players and what
makes them tick.''

GRAMMYS GET `SUPERNATURAL' WITH SANTANA
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: with GRAMMY-ANALYSIS) 
By VALERIE KUKLENSKI 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Capping the success of his best-selling album in a
30-year career, fusion guitarist Carlos Santana received a whopping
nine Grammy nominations Tuesday, including record and album of the
year. His recording ``Smooth'' also garnered a song of the year nod
for writers Itaal Shur and Rob Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   The National Academy of Recording Arts &AMP; Sciences gave its
blessing to Santana's ``Supernatural'' album, a collaboration with
artists ranging from Eric Clapton to Everlast. Before the
nominations for the 42nd annual Grammy Awards, Santana had just
five nominations over his long career, and had won only one: best
rock instrumental in 1988 for ``Blues for Salvador.''
</P>
<P>
   The track ``Smooth,'' recorded with Thomas of the band Matchbox
20, is up for record of the year and best pop collaboration with
vocals. It will compete in that pop category against ``Love of My
Life,'' performed by Santana and Dave Matthews.
</P>
<P>
   Santana and rapper Everlast garnered a bid for best rock
performance by a duo or group with the vocal for ``Put Your Lights
On,'' and his guitar duet with Clapton, ``The Calling,'' has a shot
at best rock instrumental performance.
</P>
<P>
   The CD is up for album of the year and best rock album when the
Grammys are handed out Feb. 23 in ceremonies televised on CBS from
the Staples Center in downtown Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The 52-year-old Santana, whose San Francisco band had hits in
1970 with ``Evil Ways'' and ``Black Magic Woman,'' stole the
thunder from the rest of the field, making pop group TLC's seven
nominations pale by comparison.
</P>
<P>
   TLC is up for album of the year for ``FanMail,'' record of the
year for ``No Scrubs'' and best pop vocal performance by a duo or
group for ``Unpretty.'' The trio's nominations come amid a reported
feud between Lisa ``Left Eye'' Lopes and her colleagues, Rozanda
``Chilli'' Thomas and Tionne ``T-Boz'' Watkins, that has threatened
the stability of LaFace Records' most popular act.
</P>
<P>
   Chilli, who joined in the midmorning nominations announcement in
Beverly Hills, said, ``TLC is a hard-working group.''
</P>
<P>
   Conductor Pierre Boulez, past winner of 22 Grammys in classical
categories, chalked up another six nominations. Asleep at the Wheel
claimed five nominations, followed by four each for the Backstreet
Boys, the Dixie Chicks, Emmylou Harris, Whitney Houston and last
year's top winner, Lauryn Hill.
</P>
<P>
   The other record of the year contenders were wildly popular last
year with music buyers and disc jockeys alike: ``I Want It That
Way,'' by the Backstreet Boys; Cher's comeback hit, ``Believe'';
and ``Livin' La Vida Loca,'' by Ricky Martin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never have the nominations reflected so many different musical
points of view _ from the fanatically popular to those artists
whose influence and artistry speak with a unique and unheralded
resonance,'' said Michael Greene, president and chief executive
officer of the recording academy.
</P>
<P>
   He pointed to the album of the year category as a prime example.
Competing against Santana's guitar-laden ``Supernatural'' and TLC's
r&AMP;b grooving ``FanMail'' are ``Millennium,'' by the pop harmonizing
Backstreet Boys; ``Fly,'' by country's Dixie Chicks; and ``When I
Look in Your Eyes,'' by jazz singer Diana Krall.
</P>
<P>
   Santana and Martin, with three nominations, rode the popular
Latin music wave that marked 1999 and buoyed record sales for the
second year running. Latin-flavored tracks _ ``La Vida Loca''; ``I
Need to Know,'' by Marc Anthony; and ``Mambo No. 5 (A Little Bit Of
... ),'' by Lou Bega _ accounted for three of the five nominated
male pop-vocal performances.
</P>
<P>
   Nominees for best new artist are Christina Aguilera, Macy Gray,
Kid Rock, Britney Spears and Susan Tedeschi.
</P>
<P>
   Other contenders for song of the year, presented to writers,
include: ``I Want It That Way,'' by Andreas Carlsson and Max
Martin; ``Livin' La Vida Loca,'' by Desmond Child and Robi Rosa;
``Unpretty,'' by Dallas Austin and Tionne ``T-Boz'' Watkins; and
``You've Got a Way,'' by Robert John ``Mutt'' Lange and Shania
Twain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Millennium,'' ``Believe'' and ``Ricky Martin'' are up for best
pop album against ``Mirrorball'' by Sarah McLachlan and ``Brand New
Day'' by Sting.
</P>
<P>
   Santana's competition in the rock album category are:
``Breakdown'' by Melissa Etheridge, ``Significant Other'' by Limp
Bizkit, ``Echo'' by Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, and
``Californication'' by Red Hot Chili Peppers.
</P>
<P>
   Enimem's hot-selling ``The Slim Shady LP'' is up for best rap
album against ``Da Real World'' from Missy ``Misdemeanor'' Elliott,
``E.L.E. (Extinction Level Event _ The Final World Front)'' from
Busta Rhymes, ``I Am'' from Nas, and ``Things Fall Apart'' from the
Roots.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to album of the year, the Dixie Chicks' ``Fly'' was
nominated for best country album, along with ``Ride With Bob'' by
Asleep at the Wheel; ``Trio II'' by Emmylou Harris, Linda Ronstadt
and Dolly Parton; ``Cold Hard Truth'' by George Jones; and ``Forget
About It'' by Alison Krauss.
</P>
<P>
   This year Grammys will be presented in 98 categories, up from 95
last year. The great majority will be handed out in a dizzying pace
in ceremonies immediately preceding the prime-time telecast. New
additions include a category for best soundtrack album that
creatively compiles existing music and a redefined movie-TV
instrumental category that encompassed music written for video
games or the Internet.!end! &QL;

THE POP LIFE: A YEAR WHEN POP GENRES TOOK TURNS IN THE LIMELIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The pop charts last year were a game of rock, scissors, paper.
Three different forces were at work, each one briefly supplanting
the other. There was the rock of rap-metal bands like Limp Bizkit
and Kid Rock; the sharp, angular minimalist hip-hop that emerged
from the South with JT Money and Juvenile; and the paper was the
lightweight pop of the Backstreet Boys, 'N Sync, Britney Spears and
Ricky Martin. Rock smashed scissors, paper smothered rock, scissors
cut paper.
</P>
<P>
   And critics waited for the game to end. Bubbling beneath the
surface of a pop world in which singles flourished and albums were
undernourished were at least a dozen genres. Thanks to the success
of ``Buena Vista Social Club,'' it was a banner year for Cuban
music with releases from Ibrahim Ferrer, Los Zafiros and Eliades
Ochoa. Benefiting from the success of Lauryn Hill, a crop of soul
divas sprouted, including Macy Gray, Angie Stone and Blandinna
(Melky) Jean of Melky Sedeck. Bluegrass boomed, with musicians like
Steve Earle and Dolly Parton turning to a genre flourishing thanks
to the popularity of Alison Krauss and Bela Fleck, and alternative
hip-hop emerged with enough bands to fill compilations like ``The
Funky Precedent'' and ``Quannum Spectrum'' with quality nongangsta
tracks.
</P>
<P>
   So then, it was a year of, a century of ... lists. And here is
one more, with the pop and jazz critics of The New York Times
selecting their favorite recordings of 1999. --NEIL STRAUSS
</P>
<P>
   JON PARLES:
</P>
<P>
   1. Me'Shell Ndegeocello, ``Bitter'' (Maverick). Mourning a
breakup carries the singer into a contemplative realm where soul,
jazz, rock and folk intersect. The songs circle through gentle
vamps, trying to break free and find solace and perhaps redemption.
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   2. Nine Inch Nails, ``The Fragile'' (Nothing/Interscope). Trent
Reznor's answer to songwriter's block was, paradoxically, a double
album, one that finds fury, vulnerability, delicacy and rot. Its
strongest passion is its obsession with sounds, each one a wound or
a weapon.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   3. Fiona Apple, ``When the Pawn ...'' (Sony/Epic). No longer a
teen-ager, Ms. Apple matches the ambivalence and volatility of
troubled adult romance with music that shadows every mood swing:
confident and blue, catchy and convoluted, matching painful honesty
with ambitious craftsmanship. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   4. Tom Waits, ``Mule Variations'' (Anti/Epitaph). Waits' first
new songs since 1994 clank and scrape as they did before his
hiatus. But behind the tales of freaks and lowlife is a renewed
longing for home that is echoed in the blues, waltzes and parlor
songs under his growl and thump.
</P>
<P>
   5. Cafe Tacuba, ``Reves/Yosoy'' (WEA Latina). Cafe Tacuba, a
band from Mexico City, has surreal transformations on its mind. The
instrumentals on one disc of this double album keep shifting tempos
and textures, from string quartet (the Kronos) to angular hard
rock. In the thoughtful, mostly understated songs on the second
disc, the lyrics imagine all kinds of metamorphoses as the Beatles,
Mexican traditions and new-wave rock coalesce.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   6. Macy Gray, ``On How Life Is'' (Epic). Ms. Gray doesn't just
reclaim the optimistic grooves of late-1960s soul, with an organ
tootling like both the church and the circus. She comes up with
fully formed songs about desire and lovers' games that make the
most of her tiny, scratchy, feisty voice.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   7. Beck, ``Midnite Vultures'' (Geffen). As blaxploitation funk
riffs meet 1990s zingers, Beck plays a trashy Casanova who knows
there's devastation just outside the luxury suite. Partying while
he still can, he builds laughs into every arrangement.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   8. Rage Against the Machine, ``The Battle of Los Angeles''
(Epic). Can the testosterone surges of adolescence be channeled
into political fervor? Rapping about leftist martyrs over choppy
(and newly funky) hard-rock riffs, Rage Against the Machine bets it
can, and hedges with ample guitar mayhem.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   9. Mos' Def, ``Black on Both Sides'' (Rawkus). Mos' Def's
consciousness-raising rap navigates the narrow passage between
preachiness and cynicism. He keeps his voice casual and his backup
tracks limber, never letting his clear sense of mission stifle a
good time. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   10. Squarepusher, ``Presents Selection 16'' (Nothing). Tom
Jenkinson, alias the one-man studio band Squarepusher, makes
electronica that doesn't pretend to be pop; for variety he overdubs
himself into a jazz-fusion ensemble. The music is hyperactive and
quick-changing, teeming with so many odd noises that it's just this
side of haywire.
</P>
<P>
   NEIL STRAUSS:
</P>
<P>
   1. Cesaria Evora, ``Cafe Atlantico'' (RCA Victor). Equal parts
Billie Holiday and Buena Vista Social Club, Ms. Evora of Cape Verde
makes nondenominationally beautiful music. For this album she pours
on extra strings and brass, creating a set of songs that glides by
like a tragic heroine at a joyous party.
</P>
<P>
   2. Rage Against the Machine, ``The Battle of Los Angeles''
(Epic). In a year in which the white pop audience split between
saccharine teeny-bopper ballads and meathead rap-rock misogyny,
Rage Against the Machine scored a victory for quality with its
best, most hard-hitting album of spittle-flying protest lyrics and
high-velocity guitar sound effects.
</P>
<P>
   3. Prince Paul, ``A Prince Among Thieves'' (Tommy Boy). In an
artistic coup for hip-hop, Prince Paul gave the genre its first
fully realized opera, the rap equivalent of the Who's ``Tommy'',
with a tightly composed and well-acted tale about the death of an
MC in which narrative and beat flow seamlessly together.
</P>
<P>
   4. Randy Newman, ``Bad Love'' (Dreamworks). Taking a long
overdue respite from children's music, Newman returns as the wry
piano man who has seen it all. With razor-tongued wit, he rips into
European imperialists, dinosaur rockers (including himself) and
trophy wives, pausing every now and then for simple, poignant
sincerity.
</P>
<P>
   5. Toru Takemitsu, ``Quotation of Dream'' (Deutsche Grammophon,
performed by the London Sinfonietta, conducted by Oliver Knussen).
A gentle rebuke to those who dismiss this Japanese composer's final
works, this collection of seven colorful impressionistic
compositions (from the Debussy-quoting title piece to the leisurely
mutating ``How Slow the Wind'') shows him sketching his imaginary
garden in a drifting, harmonious world without borders, beginnings
or endings.
</P>
<P>
   6. East River Pipe, ``The Gasoline Age'' (Merge). On his most
polished album, rock's beautiful loser (the reclusive F.M. Cornog)
makes music radiant with the pain of an outcast unsure if he wants
to join the jet set or tear it apart. ``Hell is an open door,'' he
sings, drenching his voice in John Lennon-like reverb. ``Come on
everybody, get in.''
</P>
<P>
   7. Dolly Parton, ``The Grass Is Blue'' (Sugar Hill). Like Steve
Earle, Jim Lauderdale and many others last year, Ms. Parton went
bluegrass and turned in an amazing album. With an expert team of
side musicians, she radiates, whether racing at breakneck speed
through a Louvin Brothers song or wailing high and lonesome on an
original tear-jerker.
</P>
<P>
   8. Moby, ``Play'' (V2). Technically it is a simple idea: Grab
snatches of old gospel and blues field recordings, match a dance
beat to them, and nestle them into a pretty musical bed. But Moby
works it all into a powerful combination, creating a hybrid that is
neither blues nor dance but a soulful, elegant subgenre unto
itself.
</P>
<P>
   9. Toy Box, ``Fantastic'' (Edel). A Danish Euro-pop act
featuring a male with a delivery that makes Arnold Schwarzenegger
sound like Shakespeare and a female singer who makes Britney Spears
seem like Marie Curie, Toy Box is pop culture at the turn of the
century. This album is the equivalent of an E! travel special, in
which world culture is reduced to a pointless party, except there
is something innocent and addictive about Toy Box's party that
keeps me coming back.
</P>
<P>
   10. Mary J. Blige, ``Mary'' (MCA). Practically a dinosaur in the
fast turnover world of contemporary rhythm and blues, Ms. Blige has
improved with age, smoothing out the hip-hop beats in favor of slow
jams and soul rhapsody on an album that shines when it is
contemplative or resolute but weakens when it turns to self-pity.

CLINTON NOMINATES GREENSPAN TO STAY ON AS FED CHAIRMAN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With the nation poised to enter the longest period
of economic expansion in US history, President Clinton extended the
job Tuesday of the man he credits with guiding the economic
success: Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan.
</P>
<P>
   The 73-year-old Greenspan has displayed ``a rare combination of
technical expertise, sophisticated analysis and old-fashioned
common sense,'' Clinton said as he nominated Greenspan, as
expected, to a fourth, four-year term. ``His wise and steady
leadership has inspired confidence, not only here in America but
around the world.''
</P>
<P>
   In a city whose fabled motto is ``if you want a friend in
Washington, get a dog,'' Greenspan is almost universally liked and
respected. The Senate has approved Greenspan's nomination eagerly
in the past and is expected to confirm the pending renomination
easily.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been thinking about taking `alan.com' public; then we
could pay the debt off even before 2015,'' Clinton quipped.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan said the challenge of applying theories to the
marketplace discouraged him from taking retirement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like eating peanuts. You keep doing it, keep doing it,
and you never get tired, because the future is always unknowable,''
Greenspan said.
</P>
<P>
   As chairman of the Fed, Greenspan and the Fed board are
responsible for setting interest rates that affect homebuyers.
Since interest rates are a key factor in the performance of the
stock market, stockholders are also affected by Greenspan's
decisions.
</P>
<P>
   About half of American households have some connection to the
stock market, either because people trade on the market or have
pension funds that are invested in mutual funds, said Rosanne Cahn,
chief equities economist at Credit Suisse First Boston in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market Tuesday fell 359 points, a dramatic drop. But
the decline in the Dow was ``not an adverse reaction to Alan
Greenspan's reappointment,'' said Frederick Breimyer, chief
economist for State Street Bank and Trust in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The drop was mainly due to expectations that the Fed will raise
interest rates in February, Breimyer explained.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the plunge in the stock market on the day of the
Greenspan announcement ``also says his reappointment itself is not
going to send the stock market up, either,'' Breimyer said.
</P>
<P>
   Both Republican and Democratic leaders on Capitol Hill praised
Clinton's decision to renominate Greenspan, who has served for 12
years under the administrations of Presidents Reagan, Bush and
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have heard nothing from my colleagues, which would indicate
that there would be any problem with his Senate confirmation,''
said Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street is also fond of the man who has presided over a
remarkable era of economic growth. While fiscal analysts give
Greenspan credit for adjusting interest rates appropriately to keep
the economy humming, they note he has also benefited from being in
the right place at the right time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just like the president of the United States, he gets credit
when it's good, and blame if it's bad,'' Cahn said.
</P>
<P>
   The country is in its longest peacetime expansion, and in a few
weeks, will be in its longest period of growth ever, according to
forecasts by the Office of Management and Budget.
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment is 4.1 percent, the lowest in 30 years, and the
federal deficit is on track to be eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan's renomination lends a sense of stability not only to
the financial services industry, but also to the presidential
contenders.
</P>
<P>
   The leading candidates' economic plans have largely been based
on the presumption that the economy will continue to prosper.
</P>
<P>
   Economists do not believe that the nation will enter a recession
this year, Cahn and others said, but naturally there are no
guarantees.
</P>
<P>
   On the issue of Greenspan, the presidential candidates are
almost entirely _ and uncharacteristically _ in agreement. And the
performance of the bespectacled, unassuming man could have an
enormous impact on the outcome of the election, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans George W. Bush, the Texas governor, and Senator John
McCain of Arizona back the Fed chairman, as do the Democratic
contenders, Vice President Al Gore and former Senator Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have long urged President Clinton to reappoint Alan
Greenspan, and so I applaud the decision'' Bush said in a
statement. ``Chairman Greenspan's strong leadership is good for the
country and good for our economy.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain has already committed to Greenspan. ``I would not only
reappoint Mr. Greenspan,'' McCain joked during a New Hampshire
debate in December, ``if Mr. Greenspan were to die, God forbid, I
would do like the movie `Weekend at Bernie's' and stuff him and
prop him up.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican candidate Steve Forbes has expressed misgivings about
Greenspan, saying he would have a ``heart-to-heart'' talk with the
Fed chairman about his economic policies before considering
renominating him.
</P>
<P>
   For the Democrats, Greenspan's performance at the Fed could be
critical. If the economy takes a dive, Democrats could no longer
boast about their party's performance on the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's ambitious health-care plan ``would bankrupt the
country unless the economy continues to be strong,'' Cahn said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, meanwhile, would suffer by his personal association with
the administration in power.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Gore were elected in 1992 in large part because
unemployment was more than 7 percent, noted Jeff Faux, president of
the Economic Policy Institute in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was `the economy, stupid' then, and it's `the economy,
stupid' now,'' said Faux, referring to a Clinton-Gore 1992 campaign
slogan.
</P>
<P>
   ``If prosperity does go down, the Republicans' chances of
electing a president go up,'' Faux said. ``But for the Democrats,
their future relies on the economy and, to some degree, what
Greenspan is going to do.''

 UNDATED: self-pity  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEN RATLIFF:
</P>
<P>
   1. Jason Moran, ``Soundtrack to Human Motion''(Blue
Note/Capitol). This is round one of a jazz pianist's career that
ought to be worth watching closely. With Greg Osby playing alto
saxophone and producing, the album benefits from a tightly knit
band and a tart but structuralist compositional sense. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   2. Cafe Tacuba, ``Reves/Yosoy'' (WEA/Latina). The sound is
sometimes harshly electro-futuristic, sometimes nostalgic (for the
80s new wave, though the band doesn't make fun of it) and sometimes
musicological (traditional Mexican song forms with a transformative
enthusiasm). This biting, sprawling, daydreaming and tuneful double
album confirms Cafe Tacuba as one of the world's greatest rock
bands. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   3. Marcus Roberts Trio, ``In Honor of Duke'' (Columbia).
Self-consciously arty to the extreme, even while all its basic
territory, as Roberts argues, was staked out long ago by Ellington.
There's not an Ellington tune here, but it helps one to think about
the master's _ not to mention Roberts' _ radicalism. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   4. Ben Allison and Medicine Wheel, ``Third Eye'' (Palmetto).
Allison, a young bass player, is doing what jazz composers should,
ideally, do: remain open to music of all kinds, including what
young people outside the jazz realm are listening to, and work it
into ambitious, energetic compositions that do not condescend or
underestimate an audience's intelligence. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   5. Stefon Harris, ``Black Action Figure'' (Blue Note/Capitol). A
swift, finely rendered, musically literate and very contemporary
album by a young jazz vibraphonist who is evolving so rapidly that
this will soon seem a childhood picture. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   6. John Lewis, ``Evolution'' (WEA/Atlantic). Highly organized
and humid with quiet emotion, this is a late-career solo
masterstroke from Lewis, the former Modern Jazz Quartet pianist,
and its roomy sound is far above the standard of most jazz
recordings. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   7. Gonzalo Rubalcaba, ``Inner Voyage'' (Blue Note/Capitol). A
Cuban virtuoso of speed piano takes it super slowly for a change,
and the jazz-trio tracks display a touch that is so quietly
authoritative it makes your head hurt. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   8. Alison Krauss, ``Forget About It'' (Rounder). Ms. Krauss, a
bluegrass musician who has been edging away from tradition and
toward a modest version of a pop diva, has a cottony soprano that
may be one of the great voices of the day, and the songs here, by
top current songwriters in pop and country as well as obscure 70s
oldies, were expertly selected. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   9. Basement Jaxx, ``Remedy'' (Astralwerks/Virgin). A casual
description of Basement Jaxx, an English duo, might suggest that it
fits the house music genre, which could turn off anyone who doesn't
spend long nights in dance clubs. But what a dense, joyous,
pleasurable album this is, and how it stands out in a field of
music that sounds as if it is mostly made by Stepford zombies. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   10. Beck, ``Midnite Vultures'' (Geffen). In which Beck tucked in
his shirttails and delivered a perfect triumph of technical work.
The album is funky, if not indicative enough of what his working
band sounds like, and funny, if too abstract; it did not make a
quarter of the splash of ``Odelay,'' but there are layers of sound
here to savor for a long time.
</P>
<P>
   ANN POWERS:
</P>
<P>
   1. Fiona Apple, ``When the Pawn ...'' (Sony/Epic). Pundits made
fun of her pretensions, yet instead of the expected rantings of a
pinup girl, Ms. Apple offered some of the most immediate,
individual and just plain human music of the year. This is no pawn,
but a well-armed knight on a visionary quest.
</P>
<P>
   2. Mary J. Blige, ``Mary'' (MCA). Women's voices lifted rhythm
and blues out of the doldrums last year, from TLC's blockbuster to
promising debuts from Macy Gray and Melky Sedeck. The queen of
hip-hop soul enjoyed a quieter triumph. ``Mary'' shows Ms. Blige's
talent in full bloom, steady and refined, but still electrifyingly
emotional.
</P>
<P>
   3. Steve Earle and the Del McCoury Band, ``The Mountain''
(E-Squared). Earle, a great country music bad-boy, is audacious
even when bowing to tradition. He set out to write certifiable
classics for this trip into hard bluegrass, enlisting the genre's
top band to render them immortal. This was the year's richest
journey into roots music's living history.
</P>
<P>
   4. Fountains of Wayne, ``Utopia Parkway'' (Atlantic). This
power-pop gem is a concept album about suburbia, but even if all
the songs were about pasteurized milk, their melodies would stick
like glitter make-up on a teeny-bopper's face. The conceptual
framework simply adds dimension to the album's indelible charm.
</P>
<P>
   5. Joe Henry, ``Fuse'' (Mammoth). Creeping up like the thoughts
that maliciously wait until your head hits the pillow, the songs on
this subtle album ennoble the term ``adult contemporary.''
Top-notch studio musicians helped build a bridge between Henry's
quirky vision (and voice) and the kind of smooth pop that permeates
the atmosphere, creating a portrait of one man's inner life as a
quiet storm.
</P>
<P>
   6. Magnetic Fields, ``69 Love Songs'' (Merge). Stephin Merritt,
the artiste behind this three-CD epic, is a miniaturist with grand
ambitions, an autodidactic pop musicologist, an ironist who cannot
resist the pleasures of sentimentalism, and an openly gay man
hanging out in the mostly straight world of indie rock. Made from
the scrapheap of pop history, this is his handmade monument to the
music of romance.
</P>
<P>
   7. Nine Inch Nails, ``The Fragile'' (Nothing/Interscope). Trent
Reznor's memorial to the writer's block he finally overcame is
certainly narcissistic and grandiose. But check out the bricks in
the thing: each riff, sample or rhythm fascinates, and they all
hang together in mysterious patterns that lay bare the effort of
their construction while defying gravity.
</P>
<P>
   8. Taj Mahal and Toumani Diabate, ``Kulanjan'' (Hannibal). Taj
Mahal has been tracing the worldwide path of the blues for decades.
This collaboration gently melds Mahal's country style with the
virtuoso stylings of kora master Toumani Diabate. Other Malian
musicians, including the nightingale-voiced Ramatour Diakite,
enrich this delicate and deep cultural exchange.
</P>
<P>
   9. Kelly Willis, ``What I Deserve'' (Rykodisc). The Austin-based
singer-songwriter Kelly Wilis used country-rock's inherent conflict
between roots and horizons to evoke that moment in early midlife
when the future starts showing its borders, and self-acceptance
becomes a painful necessity. It is a guidebook for people learning
how to live with their dreams.
</P>
<P>
   10. Quannum Spectrum, ``Quannum Projects'', and the Funky
Precedent, ``No Mayo'' (Loose Groove). While corporate hip-hop
milks hackneyed hooks and poses, hope lies with the historically
conscious, forward-looking underground. These two collections, both
from California, encapsulate a scene that overflows with what
hip-hop needs: skilled lyricists, innovative D.J.'s, grass-roots
politics and lots of laughs.

THREE ALGERIANS CLEARED OF TERRORIST TIES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ELLEMENT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Three Algerian men detained last week as federal
authorities investigated terrorism threats as the New Year
approached were essentially cleared Tuesday of having any ties to
terrorist activities in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   One of the three men was released on personal recognizance by an
administrative immigration judge while freedom for the other two,
who face misdemeanor criminal immigration charges, appeared
possible by the end of the week.
</P>
<P>
   A total of five Algerian men were questioned by the FBI and
detained by Immigration and Naturalization Service in Boston last
Thursday -- and held in jail over the weekend -- as part of a
nationwide sweep triggered by the arrest of an Algerian, Ahmed
Ressam, as he allegedly tried to smuggle explosives into the United
States from Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The sweep was denounced Tuesday by civil libertarians and an
attorney for one of the men, who called the arrests ``a mistake''
and a misguided, ``knee-jerk response'' by authorities to threats
of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   ``When all is said and done, the record of the FBI in really
being able to spot terrorism problems has been very, very
minimal,'' said John Roberts, executive director of the Civil
Liberties Union of Massachusetts. ``In the meantime, they demean
entire communities that often are Arab communities.''
</P>
<P>
   Amy Barron-Evans,the attorney for 26-year-old Ouali Mohamed
Abdel Aziz said her client had no idea why federal agents knocked
on his East Boston door last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Aziz doesn't know Ressam and has done nothing but work hard at a
variety of jobs since jumping off an Algerian ship in Boston harbor
in 1997 and swimming to shore.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he hadn't been Algerian, he would not have been swept up,''
she said after federal prosecutors chose not to make a serious
attempt to keep Aziz in custody. ``Obviously, it was a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   FBI spokeswoman Gail Marcinkewicz said the FBI only sought out
the men to question them about any knowledge they might have about
terrorism in the wake of Ressam's arrest and heightened tensions
surrounding millennium celebrations. The arrests, she noted, were
made by the INS.
</P>
<P>
   ``Information was developed that they might have information
regarding terrorism. So we went out and interviewed those
individuals,'' she said. ``They were unable to produce proper
identifications, which resulted in INS arrests.''
</P>
<P>
   She added, ``The FBI is not targeting Arab-Americans or Arabs or
Algerians. But we have a responsibility to ensure public safety and
to run down those kinds of leads.''
</P>
<P>
   Aziz remained in custody. During a detention hearing Tuesday,
assistant US Attorney Timothy Feeley made it clear to US Magistrate
Judge Lawrence P. Cohen that Aziz is not a threat to public safety.
He said the government had no evidence to warrant holding Aziz on
those grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Feeley instead argued only that Aziz might not show up at future
court dates, a suggestion Barron-Evans ridiculed by noting that
Aziz's only goal is to remain in the United States where he has
worked at several jobs and sent money home to his family. He is
engaged to an American woman.
</P>
<P>
   She also said Aziz has been living with his older brother,
Ghani, who is in the country with INS approval. Ghani Aziz and his
brother's fiancee, Kim Sullivan, were in court but declined to
speak with reporters. Aziz was at Sullivan's East Boston home when
authorities showed up.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen took Barron-Evans' request that Aziz be freed on bail
under advisement.
</P>
<P>
   A detention hearing for the second Algerian facing criminal
charges, Lahouari Haoud was postponed until Friday because an
Arabic language translator could not be located Tuesday. However,
Feeley said he will not argue that Haoud is dangerous.

IN COMPUTER SECURITY BUSINESS, A GOOD OFFENSE IS OFTEN THE BEST
DEFENSE 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By PETER WAYNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Members of the computer security industry _ the folks who keep
credit card numbers safe from prying eyes on the Internet, among
other things _ can be a contentious bunch. Competition, after all,
often consists of trying to break the other guy's code-scrambling
technology in order to sell a fix or alternative product.
</P>
<P>
   But even by those standards, the industry is girding for an
especially nasty fight when the annual RSA conference takes place
early this month.
</P>
<P>
   RSA, the public key encryption algorithm named for Ronald
Rivest, Adi Shamir and Leonard Adleman, who invented it in 1978, is
the foundation on which much of the security protecting consumers
and merchants on the World Wide Web has been built.
</P>
<P>
   Those systems are under constant assault by security experts,
competitors and hackers alike.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, several widely used encryption technologies,
including one used to scramble cell-phone conversations, have been
cracked or at least seriously threatened _ all by security experts
in the name of protecting data.
</P>
<P>
   Among the more interesting recent attacks is one created by
nCipher, a small British company that makes special hardware it
says can encrypt information faster and more securely than a
typical computer can. One of its scientists, Nicko van Someren,
recently demonstrated a simple program that can extract the secret
keys locked in a Web server used to process credit card
transactions.
</P>
<P>
   It is one of the first practical demonstrations of a theoretical
approach to code breaking that van Someren developed about 18
months ago with Shamir, the Israeli cryptography expert who is the
``S'' in RSA.
</P>
<P>
   The attack is cause for concern because someone with a company's
secret keys _ the digital codes that unscramble data _ can use the
information to masquerade as that company and to steal credit card
numbers and other financial data.
</P>
<P>
   ``While the merchants running the servers are the targets, the
customers are the victims,'' says Alex van Someren, Nicko's brother
and the chief executive of nCipher. ``If the Web servers are
compromised, ultimately the financially sensitive information
that's going to be lost belongs to a customer.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the nCipher attack could hurt small merchants the most
because as a matter of economy, they often share Web servers, the
big computers that operate Web pages, with other merchants.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, many experts assumed that the casual barriers
separating various companies' Web sites on the same server were
more than adequate. This attack, however, circumvents those
barriers by loading a special version of a program that merchants
on the same Web server typically share. Known as a CGI, for
``Common Gateway Interface,'' this program's job is to record the
details of a transaction and send back customized messages to
consumers thanking them for their orders.
</P>
<P>
   Van Someren demonstrated that a CGI could be written in such a
way that it evades the thin walls of security that separate
companies on the same server and identifies secret keys. The attack
works against most operating systems that power Web servers,
including the Microsoft Corp.'s Windows NT and Windows 2000 and Sun
Microsystems' Solaris.
</P>
<P>
   One of the more novel elements of the attack is the fact that it
works blindly. While the CGI can slip around the barriers and read
data stored in the server's memory, it receives no clues as to what
the data means.
</P>
<P>
   So how does it find the secret keys hidden among all the other
scrambled data? Paradoxically, by spotting the very randomness that
makes data-scrambling secure in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Van Someren and Shamir found that the keys are substantially
more random than most other data. Alphanumeric text _ the letters
and numerals consumers give to Web sites, for instance _ is
generally repetitious and rife with patterns. And since text is
typically represented by numbers between 32 and 127, Someren's
program scans the server's memory looking for data that include all
possible numbers with no concentration of any particular value.
</P>
<P>
   Not coincidentally, nCipher makes a product that defends against
attacks, so it is in the company's best interest to warn online
merchants about the malicious CGI. it created. NCipher also
published details of the program, making it easier for hackers to
duplicate _ thus making e-commerce sites more vulnerable to attack
and more likely to buy nCipher's product.
</P>
<P>
   While this kind of activity might be deemed unethical in many
other lines of work, it's considered fair game in the security
industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it blackmail?'' said Alex van Someren. ``The key issue here
is we have to break the systems here to make them stronger. You
need to understand how people break in to keep them out.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, he argued, keeping the company's knowledge about the
attack a secret might have been even more unethical. Publishing a
general warning, he noted, at least made it possible for Web
masters to defend their sites.
</P>
<P>
   He added that online merchants were free to adopt any number of
defenses, including solutions from nCipher's rivals _ though he
insisted that nCipher's specialized hardware, especially when
running the latest version of its software, offered the fastest,
most reliable way for Web sites to protect their secret keys.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, nCipher is not the only company that makes
specialized hardr encrypting and decrypting credit card
numbers and other sensitive information. IBM and other companies
specializing in electronic commerce offer competing products and
are constantly engaged in researching the technology.
</P>
<P>
   And in general, security hardware that is separate from the
server computer offers an advantage because it removes the keys
from the scrambled data, making them unavailable to hackers who
find a way around a server's security systems.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Neumann, a computer security researcher at SRI
International in Menlo Park, Calif., says that such hardware is a
wise investment because Microsoft and other makers of operating
systems have done little to plug security holes in their products.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew how to solve many of these problems in the 1960s,''
Neumann said, ``but we've lost all of that in the mainstream.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Hettinga, chief executive of Internet Bearer Underwriting
Corp., which employs several kinds of cryptography to protect
Internet transactions, said the best solution might be a sort of
cyberspace isolationism. Computer systems are becoming so cheap, he
said, that most companies should be able to avoid sharing a server.
</P>
<P>
   The CGI attack, Hettinga said, proves that these days, ``sharing
a digital commerce server is like sharing someone's toothbrush.''

STD TEST AIDS IN DETECTING CERVICAL CANCER 
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A test for a commmon sexually transmitted virus could someday
replace the traditional Pap smear in screening for cervical cancer,
especially for older women, researchers said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The human papillomavirus (HPV) is the primary cause for cervical
cancer. Two studies in the Journal of American Medical Association
showed that a test that detects the presence of HPV is more
sensitive than the Pap test, a cornerstone in preventive health
care.
</P>
<P>
   ``For women over 35 or 40, I see little reason to do a Pap
smear,'' said Dr. Thomas C. Wright Jr., associate professor of
pathology at Columbia University and lead author of one of the
studies.
</P>
<P>
   Previous studies have shown that 13 types of HPV cause more than
90 percent of cervical cancers, so testing for HPV has been seen as
one way to screen for the disease. Cancer of the cervix, the mouth
of the uterus, remains a worldwide health problem, with about
400,000 cases reported annually. About 4,800 in the US die of the
disease each year.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the Pap (Papanicolaou) smear, is the most widely used
screening test for cervical cancer. But it is an imperfect test,
said Wright. ``A single Pap smear misses about 40 percent of
cervical disease, which is why women are told to have yearly Pap
smears,'' said Wright.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, to do it, a skilled professional must do a pelvic exam
and scrape cells from a woman's cervix, and then a trained
technician must analyze the cells under a microscope. Samples with
abnormal cells are tested further to see if treatment is necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Wright and his colleagues studied 1,415 previously unscreened
South African women ages 35 to 65, using different tests. One was a
HPV self-test using a vaginal swab, like a Q-tip, which detected 66
percent of high-grade cervical disease and cancer, comparable to
the result of Pap smears performed on the same women, which
detected 68 percent. The other HPV test was performed by a
clinician. It detected 84 percent.
</P>
<P>
   However, the false-positive rate for the self-collected HPV test
was 17 percent vs. only 12 percent for the Pap smear and 15.5
percent for the clinician-done HPV test.
</P>
<P>
   In the other study, led by Dr. Mark Schiffman of the National
Cancer Institute, researchers screened 8,554 women in Costa Rica
ages 18 years and older. A total of 138 cases of high-grade
cervical disease or cancer were found, with the clinician-done HPV
test detecting 88 percent and the Pap smear 78 percent. But HPV had
almost twice the rate of false-positives, 11 percent, vs. 5.8
percent for Pap smears.
</P>
<P>
   The HPV test, made by Digene Corp., costs between $45 and $60,
and is licensed in the US only as a follow-up to an ambiguous Pap
smear. It has not been approved for routine screening, though it is
available for that purpose in other countries.
</P>
<P>
   If the self-test is reliable, then the HPV test may be
especially beneficial in developing countries, where a Pap
screening system is not in place, said Jack Cuzick of the Imperial
Cancer Research Fund in London, who wrote an editorial in the
journal.
</P>
<P>
   Although there is substantial evidence that persistent HPV
infections cause cervical cancer, Dr. Robert Burk of Albert
Einstein College of Medicine said that many infections are
transient and the lesions disappear spontaneously. As many as 70
percent of college-aged women will be infected with HPV for a short
time, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Robert J. Kurman, professor of gynecological pathology at
Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions, said he believed that within
the next 10 years there will be a switch to the HPV test as primary
and the Pap as secondary.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the HPV test is used as primary tool or as a secondary
tool, Schiffman said that a program of repeated screening will
detect virtually every single case in time for treatment.

 &HT;    No more fun for Ted and Jane: Turner, Fonda split
 &HT;    (EDS: Moving to (a) General news, (f) Financial and (e)
Entertainment categories.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ For eight years they've been the toast of the town.
Now their marriage may be toast.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's royal couple _ Ted Turner and Jane Fonda _ announced
Tuesday they have split in a statement as though from Buckingham
Palace.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we continue to be committed to the long-term success of
our marriage, we find ourselves at a juncture where we must each
take some personal time for ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The announcement even caught Turner publicists by surprise,
although tabloids have speculated for a year that the couple's
marriage is rocky. Turner spokeswoman Caroline Harkleroad said:
``This has happened so quickly that there is a lot we still don't
know. It's possible that we will issue a more detailed announcement
in the coming days.''
</P>
<P>
   Fonda, 62, is a two-time Academy Award-winning actress and
social activist. She founded the Georgia Campaign for Adolescent
Pregnancy Prevention.
</P>
<P>
   Turner, 61, is vice chairman of Time Warner and worth an
estimated $7.8 billion. He launched CNN.
</P>
<P>
   Their marriage is the third for each.
</P>
<P>
   When Jane Fonda began showing up on the arm of Ted Turner back
in 1989, the match seemed unbelievable. She was so Hollywood, heir
to an acting dynasty, outspoken anti-war activist and aerobics
guru. He was so Southern, a cocky entrepreneur known for having one
eye on the bottom line and the other on the ladies.
</P>
<P>
   In more than a decade of courtship and marriage, however, they
became Atlanta's most famous power couple, known by one label:
TedandJane.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's announcement of their separation may not be the end of
Fonda and Turner's marriage _ they say they are committed to its
long-term success _ but it sure felt like the closing credits were
beginning to roll.
</P>
<P>
   Although there had been rumors in the tabloids for more than a
year about trouble within the marriage, business observers of the
couple seemed truly surprised at the news.
</P>
<P>
   The two were seen together frequently over the past few months,
attending an American Film Institute tribute to Fonda's brother
Peter; taking in the Elton John concert that opened Atlanta's new
Philips Arena; riding in a horse-drawn carriage to a film premiere
in Charleston, S.C.
</P>
<P>
   The couple showed no obvious signs of discord in November, when
they traveled to Mozambique on business for Turner's U.N.
Foundation, which is disbursing his $1 billion gift to United
Nations projects. The two rode together on a bus, sitting side by
side. After a spirited disagreement about the fight against AIDS,
Fonda gently straightened Turner's tie and brushed off the
shoulders of his jacket.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks ago, the couple attended the wedding of Turner's son
Beau in Dallas, dining on bison at a rehearsal dinner held at the
Dallas Museum of Art. Those who attended said that the couple
appeared to be getting along well, and gave no hint of splitting.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as New Year's Eve, spokespeople were expecting the
couple to spend the holiday together at Avalon, Turner's Florida
ranch. That's where the couple married in December 1991, on Fonda's
54th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, when the news broke, Fonda was spotted at the CNN
Center, where the couple has a penthouse apartment. Turner was out
of town, a spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement of the separation came in a three-sentence
press release, released quietly on a public-relations wire service
at 3:04 p.m. It failed to answer many of the obvious questions: Who
will live in the couple's CNN Center apartment? What about Fonda's
commitment to G-CAPP, the Georgia Campaign for Adolescent Pregnancy
Prevention? Will the Turner Foundation and its philanthropical
efforts be affected?
</P>
<P>
   Close friend Peter Bahouth, head of the Turner Foundation, said
late Tuesday he did not want to comment on the separation. ``But I
will say this, Jane is staying on the board.''
</P>
<P>
   Lyn May, executive director of G-CAPP, says Fonda ``is still
devoted to the cause,'' adding that they were nailing down details
for a G-CAPP convention in Atlanta in February.
</P>
<P>
   Xernona Clayton, founder and executive producer of the annual
Trumpet Awards, a Turner-sponsored dinner that achievement by
African Americans, said Turner and Fonda had already confirmed they
will attend Monday's event. ``Ted will be bringing words of welcome
as he has every year, and Jane will be presenting the Crusader
Award to the Rev. Jesse Jackson along with Andy Young,'' Clayton
said.
</P>
<P>
   According to Forbes magazine's latest list of richest people,
Ted Turner is worth an estimated $7.8 billion, most from ownership
of Time Warner stock. In 1992, Fonda's net worth was estimated at
$60 million.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the normally private Fonda gave The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution newspaper this glimpse inside her marriage
with Turner: ``I mean, it is hard. It's to his credit that at a
later age, he met a woman who's very different _ you know, I'm a
year older than him, and I'd had my own life. I'd run my own
agenda. I don't need anybody else's money, I'm very self-sufficient
and independent. You know, if I don't like it, I can walk. And he
was not used to that. It was a big adjustment, and it's to his
credit....
</P>
<P>
   ``We're both very similar that way. We are capable of changing
when we realize that there is a better way.''
</P>
<P>
   The sober mood after the announcement was quite a change from
the lovestruck days in 1990, when Atlantans made a pastime out of
watching Ted court Jane. From their first encounter, when a brash
Turner phoned Fonda and asked her for a date after hearing she was
splitting from her husband Tom Hayden, to sightings of the couple
in restaurants and events around town, Fonda shocked the world with
her demure _ almost girlish _ demeanor around Turner.
</P>
<P>
   In the early '90s, she attended nearly every function with him,
even rubber chicken dinners sponsored by local civic groups.
Sitting quietly in the back, she sometimes was unrecognizable,
looking more like a Buckhead socialite than an Academy Award
winning actress.
</P>
<P>
   Media reaction to the story varied. CNN announced the separation
Tuesday afternoon as a news brief, then repeated it later in the
afternoon on ``Showbiz Today.''
</P>
<P>
   The New York tabloids planned to be less restrained. It was a
candidate for page one at the New York Daily News. ``From my
perspective, this is what you call a gift from God,'' said Alan
Mirabella, deputy managing editor for features. ``It's the Mouth of
the South vs. Barbarella. It's a great story of two really famous
people who've decided to do something that seems kind of strange:
take time out from their marriage. It's that obtuse language that
will keep the story going for days, I hope.''
</P>
<P>
   At the New York Post, owned by Turner rival Rupert Murdoch, the
story was expected to get slightly less play. Marques said there
was no pressure from Murdoch to play the story bigger: ``There's an
overblown perception of that.''

   Lyn May, executive director of G-CAPP, says Fonda ``is still
devoted to the cause,'' adding that they were nailing down details
for a G-CAPP convention in Atlanta in February.
</P>
<P>
   Xernona Clayton, founder and executive producer of the annual
Trumpet Awards, a Turner-sponsored dinner that achievement by
African Americans, said Turner and Fonda had already confirmed they
will attend Monday's event. ``Ted will be bringing words of welcome
as he has every year, and Jane will be presenting the Crusader
Award to the Rev. Jesse Jackson along with Andy Young,'' Clayton
said.
</P>
<P>
   According to Forbes magazine's latest list of richest people,
Ted Turner is worth an estimated $7.8 billion, most from ownership
of Time Warner stock. In 1992, Fonda's net worth was estimated at
$60 million.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the normally private Fonda gave The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution newspaper this glimpse inside her marriage
with Turner: ``I mean, it is hard. It's to his credit that at a
later age, he met a woman who's very different _ you know, I'm a
year older than him, and I'd had my own life. I'd run my own
agenda. I don't need anybody else's money, I'm very self-sufficient
and independent. You know, if I don't like it, I can walk. And he
was not used to that. It was a big adjustment, and it's to his
credit....
</P>
<P>
   ``We're both very similar that way. We are capable of changing
when we realize that there is a better way.''
</P>
<P>
   The sober mood after the announcement was quite a change from
the lovestruck days in 1990, when Atlantans made a pastime out of
watching Ted court Jane. From their first encounter, when a brash
Turner phoned Fonda and asked her for a date after hearing she was
splitting from her husband Tom Hayden, to sightings of the couple
in restaurants and events around town, Fonda shocked the world with
her demure _ almost girlish _ demeanor around Turner.
</P>
<P>
   In the early '90s, she attended nearly every function with him,
even rubber chicken dinners sponsored by local civic groups.
Sitting quietly in the back, she sometimes was unrecognizable,
looking more like a Buckhead socialite than an Academy Award
winning actress.
</P>
<P>
   Media reaction to the story varied. CNN announced the separation
Tuesday afternoon as a news brief, then repeated it later in the
afternoon on ``Showbiz Today.''
</P>
<P>
   The New York tabloids planned to be less restrained. It was a
candidate for page one at the New York Daily News. ``From my
perspective, this is what you call a gift from God,'' said Alan
Mirabella, deputy managing editor for features. ``It's the Mouth of
the South vs. Barbarella. It's a great story of two really famous
people who've decided to do something that seems kind of strange:
take time out from their marriage. It's that obtuse language that
will keep the story going for days, I hope.''
</P>
<P>
   At the New York Post, owned by Turner rival Rupert Murdoch, the
story was expected to get slightly less play. Marques said there
was no pressure from Murdoch to play the story bigger: ``There's an
overblown perception of that.''

 &HT;    No more fun for Ted and Jane: Turner, Fonda split
 &HT;    (EDS: Moving to (a) General news, (f) Financial and (e)
Entertainment categories.)

<P>
   ATLANTA _ For eight years they've been the toast of the town.
Now their marriage may be toast.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's royal couple _ Ted Turner and Jane Fonda _ announced
Tuesday they have split in a statement as though from Buckingham
Palace.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we continue to be committed to the long-term success of
our marriage, we find ourselves at a juncture where we must each
take some personal time for ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   The announcement even caught Turner publicists by surprise,
although tabloids have speculated for a year that the couple's
marriage is rocky. Turner spokeswoman Caroline Harkleroad said:
``This has happened so quickly that there is a lot we still don't
know. It's possible that we will issue a more detailed announcement
in the coming days.''
</P>
<P>
   Fonda, 62, is a two-time Academy Award-winning actress and
social activist. She founded the Georgia Campaign for Adolescent
Pregnancy Prevention.
</P>
<P>
   Turner, 61, is vice chairman of Time Warner and worth an
estimated $7.8 billion. He launched CNN.
</P>
<P>
   Their marriage is the third for each.
</P>
<P>
   When Jane Fonda began showing up on the arm of Ted Turner back
in 1989, the match seemed unbelievable. She was so Hollywood, heir
to an acting dynasty, outspoken anti-war activist and aerobics
guru. He was so Southern, a cocky entrepreneur known for having one
eye on the bottom line and the other on the ladies.
</P>
<P>
   In more than a decade of courtship and marriage, however, they
became Atlanta's most famous power couple, known by one label:
TedandJane.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's announcement of their separation may not be the end of
Fonda and Turner's marriage _ they say they are committed to its
long-term success _ but it sure felt like the closing credits were
beginning to roll.
</P>
<P>
   Although there had been rumors in the tabloids for more than a
year about trouble within the marriage, business observers of the
couple seemed truly surprised at the news.
</P>
<P>
   The two were seen together frequentlyhe past few months,
attending an American Film Institute tribute to Fonda's brother
Peter; taking in the Elton John concert that opened Atlanta's new
Philips Arena; riding in a horse-drawn carriage to a film premiere
in Charleston, S.C.
</P>
<P>
   The couple showed no obvious signs of discord in November, when
they traveled to Mozambique on business for Turner's U.N.
Foundation, which is disbursing his $1 billion gift to United
Nations projects. The two rode together on a bus, sitting side by
side. After a spirited disagreement about the fight against AIDS,
Fonda gently straightened Turner's tie and brushed off the
shoulders of his jacket.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks ago, the couple attended the wedding of Turner's son
Beau in Dallas, dining on bison at a rehearsal dinner held at the
Dallas Museum of Art. Those who attended said that the couple
appeared to be getting along well, and gave no hint of splitting.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as New Year's Eve, spokespeople were expecting the
couple to spend the holiday together at Avalon, Turner's Florida
ranch. That's where the couple married in December 1991, on Fonda's
54th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, when the news broke, Fonda was spotted at the CNN
Center, where the couple has a penthouse apartment. Turner was out
of town, a spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement of the separation came in a three-sentence
press release, released quietly on a public-relations wire service
at 3:04 p.m. It failed to answer many of the obvious questions: Who
will live in the couple's CNN Center apartment? What about Fonda's
commitment to G-CAPP, the Georgia Campaign for Adolescent Pregnancy
Prevention? Will the Turner Foundation and its philanthropical
efforts be affected?
</P>
<P>
   Close friend Peter Bahouth, head of the Turner Foundation, said
late Tuesday he did not want to comment on the separation. ``But I
will say this, Jane is staying on the board.''
</P>
<P>
   Lyn May, executive director of G-CAPP, says Fonda ``is still
devoted to the cause,'' adding that they were nailing down details
for a G-CAPP convention in Atlanta in February.
</P>
<P>
   Xernona Clayton, founder and executive producer of the annual

African Americans, said Turner and Fonda had already confirmed they

THREE ALGERIANS CLEARED OF TERRORIST TIES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ELLEMENT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Three Algerian men detained last week as federal
authorities investigated terrorism threats as the New Year
approached were essentially cleared Tuesday of having any ties to
terrorist activities in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   One of the three men was released on personal recognizance by an
administrative immigration judge while freedom for the other two,
who face misdemeanor criminal immigration charges, appeared
possible by the end of the week.
</P>
<P>
   A total of five Algerian men were questioned by the FBI and
detained by Immigration and Naturalization Service in Boston last
Thursday -- and held in jail over the weekend -- as part of a
nationwide sweep triggered by the arrest of an Algerian, Ahmed
Ressam, as he allegedly tried to smuggle explosives into the United
States from Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The sweep was denounced Tuesday by civil libertarians and an
attorney for one of the men, who called the arrests ``a mistake''
and a misguided, ``knee-jerk response'' by authorities to threats
of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   ``When all is said and done, the record of the FBI in really
being able to spot terrorism problems has been very, very
minimal,'' said John Roberts, executive director of the Civil
Liberties Union of Massachusetts. ``In the meantime, they demean
entire communities that often are Arab communities.''
</P>
<P>
   Amy Barron-Evans,the attorney for 26-year-old Ouali Mohamed
Abdel Aziz said her client had no idea why federal agents knocked
on his East Boston door last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Aziz doesn't know Ressam and has done nothing but work hard at a
variety of jobs since jumping off an Algerian ship in Boston harbor
in 1997 and swimming to shore.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he hadn't been Algerian, he would not have been swept up,''
she said after federal prosecutors chose not to make a serious
attempt to keep Aziz in custody. ``Obviously, it was a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   FBI spokeswoman Gail Marcinkewicz said the FBI only sought out
the men to question them about any knowledge they might have about
terrorism in the wake of Ressam's arrest and heightened tensions
surrounding millennium celebrations. The arrests, she noted, were
made by the INS.
</P>
<P>
   ``Information was developed that they might have information
regarding terrorism. So we went out and interviewed those
individuals,'' she said. ``They able to produce proper
identifications, which resulted in INS arrests.''
</P>
<P>
   She added, ``The FBI is not targeting Arab-Americans or Arabs or
Algerians. But we have a responsibility to ensure public safety and
to run down those kinds of leads.''
</P>
<P>
   Aziz remained in custody. During a detention hearing Tuesday,
assistant US Attorney Timothy Feeley made it clear to US Magistrate
Judge Lawrence P. Cohen that Aziz is not a threat to public safety.
He said the government had no evidence to warrant holding Aziz on
those grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Feeley instead argued only that Aziz might not show up at future
court dates, a suggestion Barron-Evans ridiculed by noting that
Aziz's only goal is to remain in the United States where he has
worked at several jobs and sent money home to his family. He is
engaged to an American woman.
</P>
<P>
   She also said Aziz has been living with his older brother,
Ghani, who is in the country with INS approval. Ghani Aziz and his
brother's fiancee, Kim Sullivan, were in court but declined to
speak with reporters. Aziz was at Sullivan's East Boston home when
authorities sho
</P>
<P>
   Cohen took Barron-Evans' request that Aziz be freed on bail
under advisement.
</P>
<P>
   A detention hearing for the second Algerian facing criminal
charges, Lahouari Haoud was postponed until Friday because an
Arabic language translator could not be located Tuesday. However,
Feeley said he will not argue that Haoud is dangerous.

QUAINT WEST VIRGINIA TOWN FEELS RENDEZVOUS WITH DESTINY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHEPHERDSTOWN, W.Va. _ The 18th- and 19th-century buildings
along German Street still sparkle with thousands of white Christmas
lights and nearly every shop window bears a sign reading ``Peace''
in Arabic, English and Hebrew.
</P>
<P>
   Shepherdstown, the oldest town in West Virginia and perhaps the
prettiest, has opened its doors to teams of negotiators seeking a
peace accord between Syria and Israel. The town was chosen for its
privacy and its proximity to Washington, as well as its two easily
secured government training facilities.
</P>
<P>
   But some residents in this town of 1,300 people say it was not
convenience that brought the peace negotiators from the Middle East
to Shepherdstown, but destiny.
</P>
<P>
   ``People get a special sense as they walk these streets,
particularly in the fullness of a moonlit night or on a cool fall
evening,'' said Dr. James Price, a retired large-animal
veterinarian whose family has lived in the area for 11 generations.
``We can't explain it, but there is something about Shepherdstown's
destiny that has not been revealed to us _ and this is part of it.
These talks are one of our reasons for being.''
</P>
<P>
   Price is Shepherdstown's official historian laureate, and he has
a proclamation from the town council to prove it. He said the honor
means that he can be questioned, but never doubted.
</P>
<P>
   It does not take many questions to elicit the town's rich past
and its role in American history.
</P>
<P>
   Shepherdstown sent 100 men to fight in the French and Indian
Wars in the 1750s. The family of George Washington owned seven
homes in the area, and he slept here often. The storied Beeline
March of revolutionary volunteers in 1775 to reinforce Washington
in Boston started here. James Rumsey first demonstrated steam
propulsion of a river boat on the Potomac just above Shepherdstown.
</P>
<P>
   Shepherdstown's darkest hour came on Sept. 17, 1862, when the
entire town became a hospital for wounded Confederate soldiers
felled in the battle of Antietam, fought at Sharpsburg, just across
the Potomac in Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Robert E. Lee evacuated as many as 8,000 wounded troops
from Antietam across Pack Horse Ford to Shepherdstown, where they
filled every room of every building, except for Trinity Episcopal
Church, which was kept open as a sanctuary for those ministering to
the battle victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right up to Desert Storm,'' Price said, ``Shepherdstown has
given up her men and women in service to their country.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, of course, the town is giving up its tranquillity, at least
for this brief moment in history. Uniformed police officers watch
nearly every intersection, reporters have booked every room for
miles and the restaurants are staying open long beyond their
customary closing times.
</P>
<P>
   The town's seven-member police force has been supplemented by
the Secret Service, West Virginia state troopers, State Department
security and officers from the security force at Shepherd College,
which is located here.
</P>
<P>
   Parents of schoolchildren, worried about traffic and terrorism,
asked officials to close the schools while the talks were going on.
But the Secret Service and the State Department reassured them that
their children would be well protected. The schools remain open.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is probably the safest place in the United States right
now,'' said Mayor Vincent Parmesano.
</P>
<P>
   Parmesano, a retired Army Corps of Engineers officer, said town
officials had little notice of what was about to descend upon them.
The first inkling that something was up came two days before the
official announcement that Shepherdstown had been selected as the
site for the Israel-Syria talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our first clue was when people showed up at the Fish and
Wildlife training center asking about kosher capability in the
kitchen,'' Parmesano said. It was found acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   Most people in Shepherdstown appear pleased that their town is
the focus of global attention, at least for the time being. They
would be happy if the name Shepherdstown becomes synonymous with a
peace accord, like Camp David or Wye River, or if the town earns a
place in history as a site for a major international conference
like Bretton Woods, N.H., or Yalta, or Potsdam.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good thing _ as long as they don't make a habit of
it,'' said Jim Schmitt, a local builder.
</P>
<P>
   But there is also the fear known by many residents of quaint
places _ the fear of discovery. The entire town is listed on the
National Register of Historic Places and it has drawn thousands of
tourists, vacationers and retirees who wanted to be close to
Washington and Baltimore, but not too close.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a dichotomy between being hospitable and being loved
to death,'' said John Stealey, a professor of history at Shepherd
College. ``The town is already becoming gentrified and I'm afraid
this will accelerate the process.''

<P>
   Perhaps that too is part of Shepherdstown's destiny, Price
suggested. The town has suffered a great deal, as well as profited,
by its proximity to Washington and its role as a river and railway
crossroads.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the news broke that the peace talks were to come here, I
thought that once again we are going to be asked to put up with
inconveniences, stand in lines, be held up in traffic, have our
lives disrupted,'' Price said. ``But we're willing to make those
sacrifices, as we have for 250 years, in order to increase the
chances for peace.''

ENDORSEMENTS FLOW, BUT IS ANYBODY LISTENING?

   BEDFORD, N.H. _ With Elizabeth Dole endorsing George W. Bush
Tuesday and Senator Edward M. Kennedy set to back Al Gore
Wednesday, the presidential candidates are counting on the
announcements to bring new supporters. But evidence that such
endorsements make any difference with voters is decidedly mixed,
perhaps nowhere more so than in independent-minded New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts say such endorsements could work against Bush and
Gore because voters in the first-primary state have a history of
going against the establishment candidate. In 1996, for example,
Bob Dole was backed by many state political leaders, including
then-Governor Stephen Merrill, but the New Hampshire primary was
won by the anti-establishment candidate, Patrick J. Buchanan, who
had relatively few endorsements.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is completely predictable,'' said Dartmouth College
government professor Dean Spiliotes. ``Initially, endorsements give
you credibility as a candidate. But now, given the climate of
politics up here, being endorsed by an establishment politician is
not always the best thing for your candidacy. It just reinforces
your business-as-usual position.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Kennedy hopes to provide support for Gore among
liberals and lend credibility to Gore's health-care plan. Elizabeth
Dole could help Bush among women and younger voters.
</P>
<P>
   But the bottom line is there were no major surprises in this
week's endorsement news. The announcements that tend to shake up a
race occur when major political leaders reject the establishment
candidates, such as when Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New
York last year announced his support for Bill Bradley in the
Democratic race. A Kennedy endorsement of Bradley would have dealt
a very serious blow to Gore, but a Kennedy endorsement of the vice
president is likely to have much less impact.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the timing of Kennedy's endorsement is intriguing, coming
just 10 days before the nation's leading liberal group, Americans
for Democratic Action, plans to begin discussing whether to endorse
any candidate in the primaries. Amy Isaacs, the group's national
director, said her 120-member board seems split between Gore and
Bradley. It takes a 60 percent vote of the board for an endorsement
from the organization, which has 65,000 members, many of them
activists who participate in primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the impact of Kennedy's endorsement on her
membership, Isaacs said: ``It will be one of many factors. We work
very closely with the senator, so it is bound to have an impact.''
</P>
<P>
   But, like a number of people interviewed for this report, she
stressed that a Kennedy endorsement of Bradley could have had a
much deeper impact. ``People would have said, `Whoa,' if Kennedy
had felt that strongly about it, because Kennedy had his own
insurgency campaign'' in 1980 against then-President Jimmy Carter.
</P>
<P>
   Gore declined during a visit to Somersworth High School to
acknowledge that he is receiving Kennedy's endorsement, but he
lionized Kennedy as ``the single greatest United States senator I
have served with.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone would benefit enormously from an endorsement
from someone like that,'' Gore said. ``I think endorsements are
important if they are coupled with strong support at the grass
roots and enthusiastic commitment from people in the precincts of
New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have that, then, I think people who respect the person
involved certainly take that into account,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy and Gore plan to appear at a Boston middle school to
talk about education policy Wednesday before driving to Portsmouth,
N.H., to discuss health care with senior citizens.
</P>
<P>
   A person close to the Kennedy campaign, noting the senator is
running for reelection this year, said: ``The idea of a mass of
financial support or Kennedy workers, I think you can probably say
that won't be forthcoming. But Kennedy's credibility on health care
is enormously helpful to Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has made health care a central issue in his campaign,
promising to provide insurance to 95 percent of Americans and
criticizing Gore's proposal for not going far enough. Kennedy has
been a Senate champion of various national health insurance
programs for decades.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, presenting himself as an outsider, has not relied on
endorsements and has received none from his home-state
congressional delegation in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Endorsements have played a key part in the campaign, but mostly
at the beginning of the race. Bush initially became the Republican
front-runner nationally due to his ability to wrap up so many
endorsements so early. The initial burst of enthusiasm for the
Texas governor's candidacy came after many Republican governors
backed him, which led to an outpouring of financial support and
accompanied his rise in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Dole's backing of Bush was unsurprising because she is viewed as
angling for the vice presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Governor Bush is doing so well with women, with the old, the
young and minorities,'' Dole said Tuesday before a crowd of some
350 people at a restaurant here. ``If I can be of just a little
help with those voters, I'll be pleased.''
</P>
<P>
   She swatted away questions about her stand last year for tougher
gun control laws, saying, ``We are in sync on the vast majority of
the issues.'' Bush, she said, is ``my kind of conservative.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, asked whether he would choose Dole as his running mate,
said, ``First things first. It's important to have a strong woman
like Elizabeth Dole standing by my side to help me win the
primaries and the caucuses.''
</P>
<P>
   Dole's husband, Bob, has not endorsed any candidate but is a
close friend of Arizona Senator John McCain, Bush's top rival. Bob
Dole last year caused a stir when he said he was considering
contributing $1,000 to McCain's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we'll ever discuss it,'' McCain said Tuesday
about Bob Dole during a New Hampshire visit. ``I totally expect the
establishment to be supportive of Bush. I have the greatest
affection and admiration for both Doles.'' But McCain added that he
hoped Bob Dole would still contribute to his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Endorsements may have more impact in Iowa, which votes by highly
organized caucuses, than in New Hampshire. Tuesday, Bush traveled
with Elizabeth Dole to Iowa to receive the long-expected backing of
Senator Charles Grassley, who said the Texas governor is ``a man
who inspires us with optimism and faith.''
</P>
<P>
   Grassley is highly popular in Iowa and effective in grass-roots
organization, an element that will be vital in the Jan. 24
caucuses. Bush already has won endorsements from other prominent
Iowa Republicans, including two former governors, Terry Branstad
and Robert Ray, who held the state's chief executive office for 30
consecutive years.
</P>
<P>
   Branstad, in a telephone interview, said: ``An endorsement by
itself, standing before the microphone, is of some benefit. But if
you can deliver key organizational people who turn out people to
vote, that is what really counts.''

A HIGH CHINESE OFFICIAL TALKS OF 7% GROWTH THIS YEAR 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By MARK LANDLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Defying the gloom of many outside economists, a senior
Chinese official predicted Tuesday that the country's economy would
grow by at least 7 percent this year. Such a performance would
extend China's status as having one of the fastest-growing
economies in Asia _ a record it has achieved despite weak consumer
spending and severe economic disruptions in many of its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   The official, Zeng Peiyan, said China's performance in 2000
would equal that this past year, when the economy grew 7.1 percent.
``We can achieve the growth rate of 1999,'' said Zeng, the minister
in charge of the State Development Planning Commission. ``We are
confident this will not be a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Zeng also reaffirmed Beijing's intention not to devalue its
currency, the yuan, also known as the renminbi, or ``people's
money.''
</P>
<P>
   Speculation that China might decree a lower value for the yuan
has been an underlying source of anxiety in Asia since the
financial crisis beginning in 1997 that hobbled Thailand, Malaysia,
Indonesia and South Korea. A cheaper Chinese currency could help
stimulate China's economy but could also force its neighbors to
devalue their currencies as well, setting off more instability.
</P>
<P>
   Chinicials have repeatedly denied that they plan a
devaluation, and Tuesday Zeng said, ``There is not any need to
devalue the renminbi in the near future.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese government will establish its official growth target
in March, at the annual meeting of the National People's Congress,
China's legislature. But Zeng's comments, made in a news conference
here, are an early signal that Beijing is not scaling back its
ambitions, even in the face of multiple hurdles.
</P>
<P>
   Among these is the continued lack of consumer demand, which has
led to steep price deflation in everything from cars to computers.
China has tried to compensate for that by ordering a moratorium on
the production of some types of goods to reduce the supply, and by
pouring money into roads, bridges and other projects to create
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   But after spending $24.2 billion on such infrastructure projects
last year, economists say that Beijing can no longer prop up its
economy through public works alone.
</P>
<P>
   Zeng said the spending had added two percentage points to
China's growth in 1999. And he said China would issue more bonds
this year to finance yet more projects. But as Andy Xie, an
economist with Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in Hong Kong, noted,
``There aren't that many things left to build.''
</P>
<P>
   Xie said China's 7 percent target ``is almost part of the
folklore now.'' Like many economists, he is skeptical about that
figure, which he says is driven more by political imperatives than
economic realities. Xie said China's growth this year would be
closer to 5 percent _ still impressive, but not strong enough, by
his reckoning, for a country with a work force that increases 10
million a year. ``This is the nub of the problem for the Chinese
government,'' he said. ``They need growth of a percent to
create jobs for all the people who want them.''
</P>
<P>
   There are some bright spots in China's economic picture. Thanks
to the rapid recovery of the rest of Asia and the continued vigor
of the United States, Chinese exports increased by a remarkable 6
percent in 1999, to $195 billion. As a result, China has a trade
surplus of $30 billion. Those figures have quieted persistent
rumors that Beijing might devalue its currency to improve the
competitiveness of its exports.
</P>
<P>
   Still, exports account for a fifth of China's gross domestic
product, far less than with most other Asian nations. So Beijing
cannot depend on them to determine its growth. ``Exports will not
bail out China,'' said Dong Tao, a Credit Suisse First Boston
economist in Hong Kong. ``Whether China grows 7 percent, 8 percent
or 5 percent will depend on other factors, like private spending.''
</P>
<P>
   Zeng said China was nearing the bottom of a deflationary spiral
that began two years ago. ``By the end of this year,'' he said,
``there will be a balance rather than a minus or positive change.''
</P>
<P>
   The government has raised the salaries of some workers, mainly
in urban areas, to stimulate spending. Zeng said Tuesday that
Beijing would bolster its social welfare programs and cut taxes.
``After those guarantees,'' he said, ``ordinary people will gladly
spend more money.''
</P>
<P>
   But Xie noted that China's factories were still producing many
more goods than consumers wanted to buy. Until the government
resolves this overcapacity _ by shutting down inefficient plants _
he said its increasingluous efforts to stimulate demand
would not halt deflation.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two years, China has masked many of these weaknesses
with the vast public spending program. It now has $120 billion in
foreign debt _ 75 percent of it accrued in the last three years.
Although economists say China could always issue billions more in
bonds, the costs of debt servicing soaked up 35 percent of
government revenue last year.
</P>
<P>
   State spending began declining in the third quarter of 1999, and
economists said it would fall further this year. ``The question is
whether the rebound in consumer spending will be strong enough to
offset the decline in public spending,'' Tao said. ``I think it's
going to be extremely difficult to pull off.''

<P>
   MILTON, Mass. _ Is there a more melancholy midwinter New England
sight than a melting ski slope defiled by great patches of mud? Can
there be a glummer calling than that of Stanley Beers, manager of
the Blue Hills Ski Area here, on days like this when nobody stops
by the lodge but the occasional rubber-booted hiker?
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday morning, said Beers, who has taken a second mortgage on
his house to keep the ski area open, his ski school director, Jim
Sutherland, told him, ``I feel like the Maytag repairman,'' the
advertising character who never got any business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every year,'' Sutherland said, ``you think you've seen the
worst of it, and then the next year comes and it gets even worse.''
</P>
<P>
   The unusually warm and snowless weather that has been breaking
records over New England may mean pleasant shirtsleeve strolls for
some, but it means ulcers to businessmen dependent on snow, from
snowmobile stores in Maine to ski centers in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Even the major ski resorts of northern New England, with their
extensive snow-making, have shown signs of snow shortage. American
Skiing Co., the financially precarious skiing giant, promised
package guests at its six major New England resorts that if 70
percent of the slopes were not snow-covered when they arrived
Christmas week, they would receive future discounts and $500 toward
a stay at two compants in the west. Four of its six New
England resorts did not make it by Dec. 25, a spokesman said, so it
is giving the discounts to all its Christmas week guests.
</P>
<P>
   Skiing areas in the West, too, have reported less snow than
usual and late openings of some trails. At Crested Butte Mountain
Resort in Colorado, only 45 percent of groomed trails were open by
Monday, said a spokeswoman, Gina Kroft. And in Utah, some resorts
reported that a combination of millennium fears and little snowfall
had cut the number of skiers by one third or more.
</P>
<P>
   In New England, some smaller alpine ski resorts and other
businesses, like cross-country ski centers that depend on snow from
clouds rather than machines, report feeling pinched by the strange
pre-winter spring that continued in much of the region Tuesday.
Providence, R.I., reported a near-record temperature of 60 and
Boston has not seen measurable snow for 395 days, two days short of
a record. From Portland, Maine, to Providence, New England towns
saw record high temperatures on Monday, as well, and spots from
Burlington, Vt. to Portland report snowfall to date at only a
fraction of the usual level.
</P>
<P>
   In Greenville, Maine, Paul Fichtner III, the owner of Big Lake
Equipment, said that during a typical Christmas season, he sells
$5,000 in accessories and a half-dozen snowmobiles. This winter,
the most snowless one in his memory, he has sold just $500 in
accessories and one child-sized snowmobile.
</P>
<P>
   Greenville, once mainly a lumber town, is heavily dependent on
snowmobile tourism, Fichtner said, ``and if there is no snow,
there's no business. It's as simple as that. I haven't put my cash
drawer in the register since a week before Christmas.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is some snow up here and there is snowmobiling going on,
but the only people going are the real hard-core guys; they are
hitting rocks and stumps and banging up their machines,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Connecticut, some ski resorts reported that warmer, snowless
weather has forced them to open later than they would like. ``It's
been staying warmer and we've been getting less snow the past few
years,'' said Ed Beckley, general manager of the Mount Southington
Ski area in Southington, ``and the major impact it's had on us is
having to open later in the season, sometimes as late as Dec. 25.
Natural snow is the best advertisement for skiing, and after a snow
storm, we always have a 50 percent increase in attendance, and
there haven't been many snow storms the past couple of years. We've
definitely seen a dip in attendance.''
</P>
<P>
   That dip can also be observed at cross-country skiing resorts,
which make far less snow than their alpine counterparts. Anyone who
called the ``snow phone'' of ``Ski New Hampshire,'' a consortium of
35 New Hampshire skiing centers, Tuesday to check on cross-country
skiing conditions, heard a disheartening summary: ``It looks like
we're off to a soggy start today and that's limiting terrain for
us.'' The picture in Vermont has been similar.
</P>
<P>
   In New York state, Ann and Olavi Hirvonen, owners of the Laplan
Lake Cross Country Ski &AMP; Vacation Center in Benson, said that on a
normal winter weekend they have 350 to 600 lodgers and skiers. But
recently, they have been averaging only about 100. Hirvonen, a
native Finn and former member of the U.S. Olympic cross-country ski
team, has been introducing his American guests to Kyykka, a Finnish
game similar to bowling, to entertain them in lieu of skiing.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone is suffering. Some stores say that the
disappointing outdoor climate is more than offset by the luxurious
economic climate. ``We've been bombed with business,'' said Danny
Canton, assistant manager of the ski shop at the Alpin Haus in
Amsterdam, N.Y. ``It's hard to explain, but the economy is good and
people are optimistic that winter will eventually arrive.''
</P>
<P>
   Larger ski areas are also buffered from the vagaries of the
weather by their ever-expanding snow-making capacity. In New
England, several resorts that closed in the mid-'90s have
re-opened, usually with infusions of capital that went in part for
snow machines. Even so, resorts large and small pray for snow, both
for the money they would save on snow-making and for the enthusiasm
it ignites in skiers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they see snow in the backyard, they'll come,'' said Beers
of the Blue Hills Ski Area.

HIGHEST-RANKING WOMAN IN HOUSE REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP RETIRES 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rep. Tillie Fowler of Florida, the highest-ranking
woman in the House Republican leadership, said on Tuesday that she
would not seek re-election this year, honoring a campaign pledge
she made in 1992 to serve only four terms.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement by Mrs. Fowler, who as vice chairwoman of the
Republican Conference ranks fifth in the party's House hierarchy,
brings the number of House Republicans who are retiring or seeking
other elective office to 21, compared with only 6 House Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the only black member of the Republican leadership,
Rep. J.C. Watts Jr. of Oklahoma, the conference chairman, is
debating whether to run again.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans outnumber Democrats in the House by 222 to 212;
there is one independent, who usually votes with the Democrats.
That means the Democrats could seize back control of the House,
which they lost in 1994, with a net gain of five seats this
November.
</P>
<P>
   ``House Republicans can't even keep their leadership from
retiring, much less their rank and file,'' said John Del Cecato, a
spokesman for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.
</P>
<P>
   But Republican strategists played down the significance of the
move by the 57-year-old Mrs. Fowler, noting that her 4th District
seat is solidly Republican. After winning her first election, in
1992, she ran unopposed in that Jacksonville district three
straight times.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is nothing surprising,'' said Jill Schroeder, spokeswoman
for the National Republican Congressional Committee. ``She's just
honoring her term-limits pledge.''
</P>
<P>
   But after Mrs. Fowler was elected to the leadership position
last year, she reconsidered her promise. In response, a group
favoring term limits ran radio and television advertisements in her
district, criticizing her as Slick Tillie.

MOTHER, DAUGHTER SUE CONTINENTAL AIRLINES 

</HEADLINE>

c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ A mother and daughter injured during a 1998 flight
that was caught in turbulence and then made an emergency landing in
New Orleans are suing Continental Airlines for unspecified damages.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs are U.S. citizens who live in Italy and have
relatives in Houston, said their Dallas attorney, Michael Sawicki.
</P>
<P>
   They were on an MD-80 aircraft headed from Houston to
Washington, D.C., on Aug. 17, 1998, when it dropped nearly 800 feet
after hitting air turbulence at 29,000 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Sawicki said none of the passengers were warned of the
turbulence, and his client, Deborah Ammoniaci, then 10, was given
the ``all clear'' to go to the restroom, where she was tossed about
during the drop.
</P>
<P>
   Her nose was broken and she has required plastic surgery, he
said, while her mother, Phyllis Santleben, suffered less serious
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Continental spokeswoman Julie Gardner declined to comment
Tuesday, but Continental officials said at the time of the incident
that passengers were warned about the high-altitude turbulence and
cautioned to remain buckled in their seats.
</P>
<P>
   News reports said 10 of the 109 passengers, as well as two crew
members, were treated for minor injuries after the undamaged plane
made an emergency stop in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   Sawicki said Santleben teaches English at a military base in
Italy and was in the United States with her daughter to visit
relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Their state district court lawsuit seeks unspecified actual and
exemplary damages for medical expenses and mental anguish against
the Houston-based airline. It said the plaintiffs have incurred
about $1,800 in medical expenses.

 &HT;    THE POLITICAL TICKER: Quick hits from the trail
 &HT;    By Ernie Freda

<TEXT>
<P>
   Back to taxes
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bradley called Tuesday for shutting down corporate tax
breaks worth an estimated $125 billion over 10 years. Special tax
favors to big business ``make the rest of us pay more,'' he said in
New Hampshire. Bradley was known in the Senate for championing the
1986 tax law that eliminated many tax breaks, but before now has
had little to say about tax policy in the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy clout
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore also was campaigning in New Hampshire, and looking ahead
to an important endorsement from Sen. Edward Kennedy of neighboring
Massachusetts. Gore was to appear with Kennedy today at a Boston
middle school, according to the senator's office. The two then were
to travel to Portsmouth, N.H. An endorsement now would break
Kennedy's long-standing tradition of waiting until after the
convention.
</P>
<P>
   Putting it to Putin
</P>
<P>
   John McCain says acting Russian President Vladimir Putin should
be pressed to end the conflict with Chechen militants under threat
of sanctions. ``I'd state unequivocally that there would be no more
(U.S.) export-import loans, that the United States would not
support any further IMF funding until this thing is brought to some
kind of reasonable conclusion,'' McCain said aboard his campaign
bus in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Too close to call
</P>
<P>
   In New Hampshire, John McCain and George W. Bush are running
neck-and-neck, according to a poll conducted during the last days
of 1999. McCain received support from 36 percent of likely
Republican voters participating in a survey conducted by The New
Hampshire Poll (plus or minus 4 percentage-point margin of error).
Bush was 3 percentage points behind at 33 percent. Fifteen percent
were undecided, and the remaining 16 percent said they would vote
for other Republican candidates. The Democrats' gap is narrowing,
too. Bill Bradley and Al Gore also are in a statistical dead heat:
42-39 percent, Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Voters make passes . . .
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bradley famously ignores fashion, but he does pay attention
to appearances. New Hampshire eye doctor Norm Michaud, who is a
Republican, stopped Bradley as he was leaving a speech Monday to
advise him against using his reading glasses in public.
``Half-glasses are why Ted Kennedy was never elected president,''
Michaud said. ``People don't like to look at you peering over
half-glasses. It doesn't make you look trustworthy.'' Bradley shook
the doctor's hand and nodded. ``Thanks. I thought about that,'' the
candidate said. ``That's why I use a TelePrompTer.''
</P>
<P>
   And this guy invented the Internet?

   Although most of the country was spared from the Y2K computer
bug, Al Gore's campaign Web site took a hit. The Associated Press
reported that the damage came inside his ``virtual town hall,''
where a message from a supporter was dated ``January 3, 19100.''

   Warren Beatty is ruling out a run for the presidency _ but not
necessarily forever. ``I'm not running now,'' he said in an
interview in the February issue of Vanity Fair. ``I think the
question is: Can I be effective at another time? Whether that is in
a year, or two years, who knows?''And for now, the actor is also
refusing to endorse anyone.

   Bill Bradley made a last-minute change to a speech in New
Hampshire on Monday that, according to the Los Angeles Times,
``kept him out of some trouble'' with the United Auto Workers. In
the prepared version of his speech on technology, Bradley was to
say that the coming explosion in information technology will be
like ``going from a horse and buggy to a Ferrari.'' The reference
to the Italian-made car was changed to the American-made Corvette
when he gave the speech.

   The `State of Taxes'

   Steve Forbes nabbed the endorsement of 33 New Hampshire anti-tax
activists who dubbed themselves the Anti-tax Coalition for Forbes.
Anti-tax Coalition chairman George Lovejoy said Forbes would scrap
the federal tax code as we know it and put in its place a ``simple
flat tax that would save families of four over $1,600.'' Forbes
criticized George W. Bush's targeted tax cuts as not doing enough.
The Manchester Union Leader said Forbes referred to Bush as the
governor of the ``State of Taxes.''

Pat Buchanan has asked that his name be kept off.

   Taking the edge off health care reform
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore said that by focusing almost exclusively on health care,
Bill Bradley would jeopardize the economy, as would the
Republicans' focus on tax cuts. As quoted in USAToday: ``If we take
the entire projected surplus over the next 10 years and just blow
it . . . on a single ill-conceived spending plan . . . you'd lose
the opportunity to keep interest rates low and to continue building
confidence in our economic future.'' Said Bradley spokeswoman
Kristen Ludecke: ``It's obvious from Al Gore's attacks . . . that
he lacks the confidence in his own agenda for the country.''

said.

NEW TEST FOR CERVI ICAL CANCER CALLED BETTER THAN PAP SMEAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DENISE GRADY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two studies being published Wednesday in the Journal of the
American Medical Association show that a newer laboratory test is
better than the old standby Pap test at detecting cervical cancer
and precancerous changes in women over 40. The new test can be done
by doctors or by women themselves, which could greatly increase the
number of women who can be tested worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   The findings are unlikely to lead to immediate changes in
medical practice in the United States, said the researchers, but
the newer test might eventually replace the Pap test for older
women or be used along with it to increase the accuracy of
detection. If further studies show it to be a reliable screening
test, it could be done easily and quickly when women visit doctors
for other reasons.
</P>
<P>
   In developing countries where death rates from cervical cancer
are high because Pap tests are not available, the newer test is
expected to be a great boon, since women can perform it themselves.
</P>
<P>
   When the new test was performed by doctors in a study of 1,415
women ages 35 and over in South Africa, it detected 84 percent of
cancers and precancerous conditions, as compared with 68 percent
identified by a Pap test. When women did the newer test themselves,
it found 66 percent, a result that was not statistically different
from the Pap test.
</P>
<P>
   In the second study, which included 8,554 women 18 and over in
Costa Rica, the newer test was performed by doctors, with results
similar to those in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   To perform the newer test on herself, a woman simply uses a
cotton swab to collect a sample of vaginal cells, which are then
sent to a laboratory to be analyzed.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Pap smear, which looks for cancerous or precancerous
changes in cells from the cervix, the newer test detects the human
papillomavirus, HPV, a sexually transmitted virus known to cause
nearly every case of cervical cancer. There are many types of HPV,
and about 15 have been found to cause cervical cancer. The test
looks for DNA from the high-risk types of the virus. The HPV test
is already approved in the United States for use by doctors to help
diagnose cervical cancer in women who have had abnormal Pap tests.
But it is not approved for general screening of healthy women.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would love to see it used in women over 40 in the U.S.
tomorrow,'' said Dr. Thomas Wright, lead author of the South
African study and director of gynecologic pathology at Columbia
Uty's College of Physicians and Surgeons. ``But that would
require somebody going to the Food and Drug Administration and
getting the test approved. My bet is that you'll see it in European
countries for screening before the U.S.''
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone news conference, Dr. Attila Lorincz, a spokesman
for the company that makes the test, Digene Corp. in Beltsville,
Md., said that was considering approaching the FDA for approval as
a screening test.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At this point, Wright said, he would recommend that the HPV test
be performed by a doctor, because it detected more cancers than
when performed by patients. But, he added, preliminary studies
indicate that women in the United States, perhaps because they are
more accustomed to using tampons, can perform the test more
accurately than the women in the study, and so the self-test may
prove a viable option.
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Mark Schiffman, lead author of the Costa Rican study and
an epidemiologist at the National Cancer Institute, said that
rather than adopting the HPV test for routine screening, the United
States should wait for the results of large studies now under way
in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Of the studies released Wednesday, Dr. Robert Smith, director of
cancer screening for the American Cancer Society, said, ``These
authors have essentially reported very important results that take
us further toward answering questions about HPV testing, but we're
not ready to immediately rewrite screening policy. I do not think
these results provide a clear direction that HPV testing should be
routine in all women 40 and older.''
</P>
<P>
   The main concern about the test is that not every woman infected
with HPV will develop cancer, and the virus test is therefore more
likely than the Pap test to give a false positive result, which
could needlessly alarm patients and lead to further testing and
perhaps even unnecessary treatment.
</P>
<P>
   False positives are especially likely in women under 40, which
is why the test is not recommended for screening them, Wright said.
The misleading results occur because HPV is extremely common, and
most young women who are infected develop immunity to the virus,
get rid of it and never develop cancer. But if the virus is present
in a woman over 40, that is often a sign that she has been infected
for a long time and that her body has been unable to eliminate it.
</P>
<P>
   An older woman with a positive test for the virus should then
have further tests to look for cancer or precancerous conditions,
the researchers said.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the South African study included only women 35 and
over, the HPV test falsely indicated cancer or precancer in 17
percent of the women, as compared with only 12 percent for the Pap
test. Wright said he expected the false positive rate to be lower,
perhaps 5 percent, in the United States because the virus is less
prevalent.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many forms of cancer, cervical cancer can be prevented
with screening tests that detect early abnormalities which can then
be treated before they have a chance to turn into invasive cancer.
No woman should die of the disease, researchers say.
</P>
<P>
   But women do die, largely because screening is not done.
Worldwide, there are 400,000 cases of cervical cancer a year, and
200,000 deaths. In the United States, 12,800 cases of invasive
cervical cancer are expected this year, along with 4,800 deaths.

 &HT;    Music industry takes the easy way out, with nominees designed to
keep everybody happy
 &HT;    By Steve Dollar
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Milli Vanilli, please come home. All is forgiven. If recent
years have seen the Grammy Awards strive for relevance and artistic
credibility in their annual prizes to the American music industry,
all that was forgotten Tuesday. This is the year the National
Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences dumbed down again.
</P>
<P>
   OK, sure: 1960s guitar legend Carlos Santana made his best album
in years _ and a surprise commercial smash _ and was rewarded with
a stellar 10 nominations, including record, album and song of the
year. Atlanta's oft-troubled but equally inspired R&AMP;B vocal trio,
TLC, got seven nominations, and will compete with Santana in the
top categories.
</P>
<P>
   Classical conductor Pierre Boulez also received six nominations.
Other multiple nominees included Asleep at the Wheel with five, and
the Backstreet Boys, Dixie Chicks, Emmylou Harris, Lauryn Hill and
Whitney Houston, all with four apiece.
</P>
<P>
   There are some class acts in that company. But looking at the
dominant nominees in the flashiest categories, you have to believe
they were selected by the teenage audience for MTV's ``Total
Request Live,'' the daily call-in show that lets viewers cast
ballots for their favorite among 20 top pop videos. The Backstreet
Boys' ``Millennium'' for album of the year? Ricky Martin's ``Livin'
la Vida Loca'' for record of the year? Christina Aguilera vs.
Britney Spears for best new artist? Lou Bega's inane, annoying fake
Latin dance ditty ``Mambo No. 5 (A Little Bit of ...)'' for best
male pop vocal?
</P>
<P>
   To be fair, it wasn't as if the mainstream pop market _ the
place where Grammy lives _ had a lot of depth to offer in 1999.
Much of the ballyhooed craze for Latin pop stars, such as Ricky
Martin and Jennifer Lopez, was based on videogenic hip-grinding and
disposably delirious beats ideal for dancing and not much else. On
one end of the spectrum, creamy teen automatons like the Backstreet
Boys and Spears offered variations on R&AMP;B-derived, rap-inflected
jingles about adolescent romance. On the other, hard rock and rap
met head on as one-time outsiders like Limp Bizkit, Korn and Kid
Rock gate-crashed the airwaves, advocating various degrees of
mayhem and misogyny.
</P>
<P>
   Grammy voters did the easiest thing theydo: nominate
seemingly everybody in one place or another. The fun stuff _ the
good stuff _ was mostly confined to sidebar categories. Dance floor
visionaries like Fatboy Slim and Moby in alternative rock. Weirdo
genius Tom Waits in contemporary folk! Caucasian goofball Eminem
and jamming organic hip-hoppers the Roots in rap. If any of these
artists had been nominated for best album or song, then a
revolution really would be televised when the awards are handed out
Feb. 23 _ or at least a small rebellion on the outskirts of
Grammyland.
</P>
<P>
   But even when trying to look slightly hip, the awards remain
conservative. It's doubtful the Dixie Chicks would have snagged a
best album nomination if the refreshingly traditional yet friskily
post-Shania Twain trio hadn't sold 2 million copies of ``Fly.''
But, hey, Grammy liked 'em last year, too. And while jazz vocalist
Diana Krall is a surprise nominee in the category, it's easy enough
to see her as the Gen X replacement for formerly ubiquitous Grammy
smoothie Tony Bennett.
</P>
<P>
   Grammy saved the biggest props to Santana _ the safe,
commercial, yet _ and thanks for small favors _ also artistically
credible choice.
</P>
<P>
   Santana's ``Supernatural'' is the kind of project that seems
custom-designed for Grammy voters. Take a classic rock guitar hero
whose commercial prospects had faded in the decade of hip-hop and
grunge. Hook up an all-star cast of collaborators, including peers
(Eric Clapton) and '90s pop personages (Rob Thomas of Matchbox 20,
rapper Eric ``Everlast'' Schrody and last year's Grammy diva,
Lauryn Hill). Split the difference between more explicitly
Afro-Caribbean-themed instrumentals and more blatantly commercial
pop tunes. Boom: Everyone gets what they want. You get a comeback
saga that also plays to the Latin trend. You get a crossover move
that zigs toward the young folks _ with guests like Thomas and Dave
Matthews _ and zags toward the baby boomers who first inhaled while
``Abraxas'' spun on their old B.I.C. turntable. There's even an
Atlanta tie-in, as locally based producer Matt Serletic produced
the multiple-nominated Thomas track, ``Smooth,'' and is also up for
producer of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The success of Atlanta's TLC (and producers Dallas Austin and
Kevin ``She'kspere'' Briggs) is heartening, especially given the
running soap opera in which it seems the group is constantly on the
verge of breaking up. ``Fanmail,'' only the trio's third album
since it formed in 1991, was wobbly as a concept album but
brilliant as a singles disc. Tracks such as the nominated ``No
Scrubs'' and ``Unpretty'' asserted feminine independence and savvy
on the sexual battlefield. The threesome _ Tionne ``T-Boz''
Watkins, Lisa ``Left-Eye'' Lopes and Rozonda ``Chilli'' Thomas _
can do the sexy video thing with ease but also bring a level of
sophistication to a game that, in 1999 at least, was virtually
brain-dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``A couple of people have called in, like, the last 15 to 20
minutes,'' said She'kspere. ``Now I'm looking at all the categories
on the Internet and I'm like, `Man! Wow!'. I was in the studio
until like 6 a.m. finishing up Pink (a female vocalist) on LaFace
(Records). ... ``I haven't been able to do anything yet ... but
knowing me I'll probably do something really nice for my staff and
I'm right back at work. I'm not really the party guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Industry observers will note with some irony the
behind-the-scenes saga exemplified by the multiple nominations for
Santana and TLC. Santana's comeback was masterminded by Arista
Records chief Clive Davis, whose corporate bosses at German-owned
BMG are targeting replacements for him when Davis steps down later
this year. The top candidate has been Antonio ``L.A.'' Reid, whose
Atlanta-based LaFace Records, which is part of the BMG empire, is
home to TLC.
</P>
<P>
   Nominations and final votes in most categories are open to all
the Grammy voting members, but a 25-person review board picks
nomineop categories. While you can view many of the
nominations as a popularity contest, some categories reflect only
the listless sensibility of the Grammy constituency. Neither sales
nor notable artistic abilities seem to be the singular determining
factor in the R&AMP;B acategories. There, it appears to be
another ``r'': recognition. So technically capable singers Barry
White and Peabo Bryson _ at the bottom of the charts _ reappear and alongside million-selling R. Kelly and Maxwell in the male
R&AMP;B vocal performance category. And in rap solo performance,
Q-Tip's worthy ``Vivrant Thing'' competes with mainstream fave
Busta Rhymes' barely noticed ``Gimme Some More.''
</P>
<P>
   Nominations in the country categories were a mix of the
big-money music makers and less commercial ventures by Nashville's
artier crowd.
</P>
<P>
   The Dixie Chicks may have put the banjo back in country music,
but the woman who brought Nashville the bellybutton also scored
with a nomination in the general categories. Shania Twain's
``You've Got a Way'' from her ``Come on Over'' album is up for song
of the year. She and other top-selling Nashville acts such as Tim
McGraw and Martina McBride were ignored in the country album of the
year category. Voters turned to more traditional talent to nominate
Alison Krauss, Asleep at the Wheel, Trio II (Emmylou Harris, Linda
Ronstadt, Dolly Parton) and George Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Grammy introduced three categories this year. Producers can now
win a prize for best soundtrack album, given for a soundtrack
record that creatively compiles existing music. The award was added
to complement the category for original movie scores. Also this
year, the academy updated its movie or television song and
instrumental composition categories to include music composed for
other media such as video games or the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   On a valedictory note, the late Robert Shaw received his final
Grammy nomination, a best classical album nod for conducting
Dvorak's ``Stabat Mater'' with the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra. Bob
Woods, president of Telarc International in Cleveland and producer
of the ASO's recordings under Shaw and Yoel Levi, said: ``This is
an occasion to celebrate the incredible legacy that we created with
Mr. Shaw and the ASO.''
</P>
<P>
   Elton John, another Grammy favorite and a part-time Atlantan,
will be favored when the 42nd annual awards are telecast. He will
receive a Grammy Legend Award, given by trunot voters.

BRADLEY CALLS FOR CLOSING CORPORATE TAX LOOPHOLES 
</HEADLINE>
  (See related stories, BUSH-DOLE and GORE-KENNEDY) 
(sw) 
 By ADAM CLYMER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEDFORD, N.H. _ Former Sen. Bill Bradley campaigned on Tuesday
for tax fairness, saying that ``when somebody hires a lobbyist to
get something in the code to reduce their corporate taxes, that
means the rest of us pay more.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, an architect of the 1986 law that closed loopholes and
reduced tax rates, reminded voters of that populist part of his
record before sketching a plan to raise $125 billion over 10 years.
``I spent an incredible amount of effort,'' he said, on closing
loopholes for individuals. ``Then the tax shelter specialists moved
to the corporate side.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he described Tuesday's plan as the ``elimination of
loopholes,''$100 billion, or four-fifths of his savings, would be
raised through better enforcement efforts and more frequent audits
of corporations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in this time of unprecedented economic growth,'' the
Democratic presidential hopeful said, ``and yet corporate tax
revenues have dropped in the past two years.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said he would not use the additional revenue for a tax
cut, but as part of the general fund. He said his object was not
the money, but ``tax fairness.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides more frequent audits, Bradley proposed requiring
companies to account for differences between the income reported to
stockholders and the income reported to the Internal Revenue
Service. He also proposed a ban on contingency fees for lawyers
offering advice on federal taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Of the remaining $25 billion he said his plan would raise, $20
billion would come by re-enacting the Superfund tax on chemical
companies. That $2- billion-a-year tax expired in 1995 after Senate
Republicans filibustered against an extension.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley suggested that so-called soft money political
contributions from chemical companies had influenced that
congressional inaction, and he called for repeal of three other tax
provisions he said soft money had influenced.
</P>
<P>
   One, costing $270 billion over 10 years, made it easier for a
company to avoid U.S. taxes by crediting profits to foreign
subsidiaries.
</P>
<P>
   Two others, costing about $2 billion over 10 years, favored oil
and gas companies. One reduced the amount of intangible drilling
costs subject to the Alternative Minimum Tax. The other was a
credit for enhanced oil recovery costs.
</P>
<P>
   Then Bradley said he would raise a final $2 billion by
unspecified charges for hard rock mining on public lands and by
increasing the livestock grazing fee on public lands. He would not
say how much he wanted to raise any of these charges.
</P>
<P>
   He said that as president he ``might be revisiting'' other
elements of the tax code to eliminate unfairness. But he said, ``I
would not revisit the subsidy for ethanol,'' a corn-based fuel
produced in Iowa, whose caucuses on Jan. 24 precede the New
Hampshire primary by eight days. Before he ran for president,
Bradley opposed the subsidy.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, a defender of the drug industry in Congress, fought
against eliminating a large tax break for pharmaceutical companies
that located in Puerto Rico, a fact that the Gore campaign recalled
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's remember that in 1992 and 1993, Bill Bradley supported a
special-interest tax loophole that was a boondoggle for the
pharmaceutical industry and then-Senator Gore voted against that in
1992,'' said Chris Lehane, a Gore spokesman.

GUN CONTROL MAKES LEGISLATIVE AGENDAS ACROSS THE COUNTRY IN 2000
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Colo., Pa., Md., Del., Calif., Ind. Conn.)   (nk) 
 By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ With a succession of mass shootings as a backdrop and
the November elections ahead, political wrangling over gun control
is emerging as a major issue in many states as lawmakers gather
this week for the start of the 2000 legislative sessions.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of killings at Columbine High School and elsewhere,
polls show that a growing number of Americans are demanding that
their state representatives do something to reduce gun violence.
Last year, state legislatures considered more than 1,000
gun-related bills. About 50 proposed to tighten controls over
access, and more than half of them were signed into law. Many that
were not passed last year are expected to be debated again this
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``To say it's going to be an active legislative year is an
understatement,'' said James J. Baker, chief lobbyist for the
National Rifle Association. ``There may not be more gun legislation
under consideration than last year, but there will certainly be as
much.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers in almost every state are preparing to debate measures
that would affect gun ownership. Following are three of the more
prominent examples:
</P>
<P>
   _ In California, the Democrats who control both houses of the
legislature, plan to build on the tough restrictions they passed
last year with a new proposal to require that gun dealers be
licensed and the guns they sell be registered, much like motor
vehicles. But Gov. Gray Davis, also a Democrat, has asked for a
moratorium on any ambitious new gun legislation.
</P>
<P>
   _ A fight among Republicans is expected to continue in Illinois,
where Gov. George Ryan, a moderate who favors tighter restrictions
on gun access, lost to Senate Republicans, who defeated a bill that
would have maintained the penalty for carrying a concealed weapon
as a felony. The governor has vowed to bring up the measure again
in the session that begins next week.
</P>
<P>
   _ In Maryland, lawmakers will consider legislation that would
require trigger locks for guns as a way to prevent accidental
shootings by children. If the legislation is passed, Maryland would
become just the sixth state to require that safety devices be part
of any sale, joining California, Connecticut, Massachusetts, New
Jersey and Pennsylvania. But in Maryland, the legislative fight is
expected to be waged across urban-rural lines, with members of both
parties on each side. Lawmakers from urban areas generally favor
the legislation, and those from rural areas oppose it.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Kozuch, the rifle association's director of state and
local affairs, said that in addition to fighting proposed gun
control measures, NRA lobbyists would be pushing for legislation
that bars municipalities from suing companies that manufacture guns
and ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, he said, 14 states passed such measures, and in the
months ahead, he predicted that as many as 20 more might do the
same.
</P>
<P>
   Both Baker, the NRA lobbyist, and Joe Sudbay, director of state
legislation for Handgun Control, a nonprofit organization that
supports tighter ownership restrictions, agreed that the shootings
in Columbine, in which 14 students and a teacher died, had played a
role in spurring efforts to pass new gun restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike Baker, who predicted that few states would tighten
controls, Sudbay said public sentiment is forcing more states to
take stronger action, especially with an election 10 months away.
As an example, he cited Pennsylvania, where the Republican
governor, Tom Ridge, and the state Legislature are generally
sympathetic to gun owners.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Pennsylvania passed a law that denied local
jurisdictions the right to sue gun makers, but Ridge also signed
into law a child-safety measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are fed up,'' Sudbay said. ``Mothers are afraid of
sending their kids to school.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps nowhere has the debate over gun control gained a higher
profile than here in Colorado, where state lawmakers expect to
consider at least five measures that would further restrict access
to guns.
</P>
<P>
   The number of bills is not so unusual, even for a Western state
where people look askance at government intervention and
Republicans have controlled both houses of the legislature since
1976. Democrats introduce them all the time.
</P>
<P>
   But this year, support for tightening access to guns has been
led by Gov. Bill Owens, a Republican, who said the Columbine
shootings convinced him that the state needs to take a more
``common-sense approach'' to gun laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``Columbine forced me and others to take a look at our current
system of gun regulations,'' Owens said in an interview. ``I
realized tre are some areas we need to fill in with new
laws.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Owens has been working to build bipartisan support
for a series of measures, some of which have been defeated in the
past.
</P>
<P>
   They would require background checks for purchases made at gun
shows, raise to 21 from 18 the minimum age to buy a handgun at a
gun show, make it illegal for someone to buy a gun at a show to
give to someone else, include juvenile records in background checks
of all firearm purchases and create liability for the unsafe
storage of firearms in the home.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, a Colorado Springs Republican, Sen. Mary Anne
Tebedo, said she planned to introduce a bill to standardize
concealed weapon laws. Colorado is one of 31 states in which people
can carry a weapon, but local sheriffs, rather than state
regulations, determine the criteria for issuing the permit.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Democrats have agreed to sponsor three of Owens' bills;
Republicans, two. And leaders of both parties are predicting that
as many as three of the measures might reach Owens for signing this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Owens said their passage could make Colorado a model for other
states. But lawmakers in both parties said they doubted any action
here would spur a national trend inasmuch as few believe that any
of the measures Owens support would have prevented an incident like
Columbine.
</P>
<P>
   But John Head, co-president of Safe Colorado, a new state
gun-control lobbying group, said he applauded Owens' efforts. ``I
don't want to see perfect drive out the good,'' he said. ``If you
try to go too far, nothing happens. You have to deal with these
things one step at a time.''

SEATTLE DROPS MOST CHARGES IN WTO PROTEST ARRESTS 
</HEADLINE>
 (nk) 
 By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Seattle officials said Tuesday they were dropping all
but about 40 of the unresolved misdemeanor cases stemming from the
tumultuous street protests of the World Trade Organization meeting
here.
</P>
<P>
   A few of the protesters said they opposed the move because they
hoped to use their trials to showcase the city's mishandling of the
demonstrations, which grew so raucous and tense that the National
Guard was called in and police officers used tear gas and rubber
pellets to disperse the crowds.
</P>
<P>
   All told, there were about 600 arrests during the protests,
which began on Nov. 30 and continued for much of the week,
attracting an estimated 35,000 demonstrators who believe the global
trade organization undermines health, labor and environmental
standards.
</P>
<P>
   A small number of people, many of them self-described
anarchists, used the protests to smash windows, spray-paint
graffiti and loot stores in the downtown area. City officials said
that felony charges would not be dismissed against those
protesters.
</P>
<P>
   Of 525 people who faced misdemeanor charges, about 210 have
already had their cases resolved through ``guilty pleas, diversions
and dismissals,'' City Attorney Mark Sidran said in a statement
released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But for most of the remaining cases, Sidran said, prosecutors
decided that it would be cumbersome to prove the charges. In many
cases, demonstrators were rounded up and bused for mass processing,
but a trial would likely require that an individual officer provide
evidence of why he or she had arrested a particular protester.
</P>
<P>
   Although there was sufficient evidence to meet the legal
standard of probable cause for arrest and charging in the cases
being dismissed, Sidran said, ``A complete review of available
evidence has led to the conclusion that the prosecution would be
unable to meet its burden of proving guilt beyond a reasonable
doubt.''
</P>
<P>
   For some protesters, and perhaps for the city at large, still
struggling to move beyond what was largely considered to be a civic
fiasco, the dismissal of charges was treated as good news. But some
of the protesters said they were disappointed because they wanted
to be put on trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was looking forward to it, on a personal level,'' said Hyde, a 27-year-old graduate student in political sociology at the
University of Washington, who was arrested for failure to disperse
and pedestrian interference, or blocking the street, which were by
far the two most common misdemeanor charges lodged against
protesters.
</P>
<P>
   ``At a trial I would have liked to talk about free speech and
the suppression of free speech that happened here, and the sorts of
parallels that suppression has to the way the World Trade
Organization works,'' added Hyde.
</P>
<P>
   Still, other protesters, and the lawyers who were representing
them, said that they were glad to learn of the dismissals, which
they said simply buttressed their contention that the charges never
should have been brought in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were so many things that were wrong in this situation,''
said Michael Kolker, a Seattle lawyer who represents two defendants
whose charges are almost certain to be dropped under the terms of
Tuesday's announcement. ``The mayor was wrong to issue the
no-protest-zone order, the Seattle police were wrong to arrest
people pursuant to the order, and then the city attorney's office
was wrong to pursue the charges. The police reports were totally
inadequate and confusing and mixed-up and basically totally
meaningless.''
</P>
<P>
   The no-protest zone, covering about 30 downtown blocks, was
ordered into effect by Seattle Mayor Paul Schell, a move that
civil-liberties groups here still hope to have ruled
unconstitutional in a court challenge that is underway.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   There were clear logistical problems with the evidence city
prosecutors received from police, which appeared to be a major
factor in the dismissals. Police initially sought to take instant
pictures of all protesters arrested, but that process proved so
time-consuming that they soon switched to taking group shots of
protesters in buses, and in many pictures individuals could not be
identified because of poor lighting or other conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Complicating matters further, many protesters did not give their
real names to police initially, instead identifying themselves only
as ``John Doe, ``Jane WTO,'' or, in at least one case, ``Emiliano
Zapata.''
</P>
<P>
   The dismissals will hardly bring closure to the riots, which
remain a source of continuing civic angst here. The City Council is
already launching a series of inquiries into all aspects of how the
world trade meeting was handled, and there are other legal cases
pending, including the constitutional challenge to Schell's
no-protest order.
</P>
<P>
   Several protesters and bystanders say they plan to file civil
claims against the city for mistreatment by the police, and some
police officers in turn have said they plan to file suit against
the city for leaving them ill-equipped to deal with the throngs.
The heads of two major police officers' organizations have called
for Schell to resign, which he says he has no intention of doing.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Sidran, the city attorney, declined to comment beyond his
statement, in which he praised the police officers but said the
arrests they made in the commotion did not, in many cases,
translate into cases that could be won at trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the police did the best they could under very
difficult circumstances,'' said Sidran, ``but the context on the
street is not the same as in a court.''

 &HT;    What goes up comes down as market dives deep
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fear of higher interest rates and a long-delayed bout of
profit-taking triggered a massive stock market sell-off Tuesday,
just two trading sessions into the new year.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index of mostly technology stocks suffered
its worst one-day point loss ever.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's renominating of Alan Greenspan as chairman
of the Federal Reserve did nothing to buoy the stock market,
although the appointment won widespread praise on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, Greenspan's strategy of braking a super-heated
economy and keeping inflation under control by raising interest
rates is one of the main reasons investors were selling on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts believe the Fed will raise interest rates again
when its policy-makers meet Feb. 2. If so, it will be the fourth
increase since June. The Nasdaq composite fell 229.46 points to
3,901.69 a day after closing at an all-time high. The loss of 5.6
percent was a minor correction by any standard. The Nasdaq's
biggest percentage loss _ 8.6 percent _ was on Aug. 31, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The blue chip Dow Jones industrial average, depressed by heavy
selling of bank and other interest-sensitive stocks, suffered its
fourth worst one-day point loss, falling 359.58 points, or 3.2
percent, to 10,997.93.
</P>
<P>
   Rate fears alone would not have accounted for the magnitude of
the selling, according to analysts. The underlying explanation was
the steep rise in stock prices in the last 2 1/2 months of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq surged almost 50 percent and the Dow about 15 percent
over that period, making profit-taking too tempting to pass up,
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is the market's expectation that corporate profit
growth _ which is good for stock prices _ will continue to be about
as strong as last year, analysts said. The test of that assumption
will come in about a week, when fourth-quarter financial reports
are issued.
</P>
<P>
   Investors will have a chance to resolve one of the oldest of
stock market debates in the next few weeks: which is more important
to stock prices, profits or interest rates?
</P>
<P>
   Both camps have their champions and the imminent release of
fourth-quarter corporate earnings reports beginning next week will
provide some new ammunition for the debate.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts blamed concern about rising interest rates for the
latest sell-off in stocks, which sent the Nasdaq composite index to
its worst one-day point loss ever on Tuesday, and gave the Dow
Jones industrial average its fourth biggest point loss.
</P>
<P>
   The rate concern is based on the widely held belief that the
Federal Reserve will raise short-term interest rates again this
year, maybe as early as its next meeting, on Feb. 2.
</P>
<P>
   Some forecasters expect a boost of as much as half a percentage
point in the federal funds rate, which would take it to 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed's reason for raising rates is to cool a robust economy
in order to keep a lid on inflation, which it regards as a bigger
long-range threat than higher rates.
</P>
<P>
   And while the Fed doesn't control Treasury yields, its expressed
fear of inflation has had the effect of pushing yields higher,
making bonds more competitive against stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The test will come when investors get a look at fourth-quarter
corporate profits reports over the next few weeks, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is not on table right now is the potential for better
earnings,'' said John J. White Jr. director of research for
Wachovia Securities.
</P>
<P>
   While the market has probably factored another rate increase
into stock prices already, he said that may not be the case with
the outlook for profits.
</P>
<P>
   Charles L. Hill, director of research for First Call, which
tracks analysts earnings forecasts, was even more emphatic about
the rate prospect.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be a new millennium, and some may think we are in a new
paradigm economy, but earnings will still be a driving factor for
stock valuation,'' said Hill.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, analysts explaining Tuesday's tumble pointed to
profit taking at the end of a long surge in stocks _ especially in
the Nasdaq market. Gains of almost 50 percent without a sell-off
are rare, in this view.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think anyone who believes the run in technology stocks would
continue without any type of correction is not being rational,''
said Charles Mayer, director of investments for the Invesco Funds
Group in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something most people expect, but when it happens they
are all surprised,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mayer also said the latest profit-taking was not limited to
managers of mutual fund and pension fund portfolios, but included
individual investors as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``The profit-taking is not just institutional. With day trading
and 24 hour online trading, there are a lot of fingers on the
(trading) trigger,'' he said.

 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The best time to leave the stage, the theory holds, is when the
audience is clamoring for more. Alan Greenspan, chairman of the
Federal Reserve Board and a man currently beloved by investors, is
about to test that theory.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton on Tuesday nominated Greenspan to a fourth
term as chairman of the nation's central bank, well ahead of the
June 20 expiration of his current term. The nomination, which was
surprising only in its early timing, was enthusiastically received
by stock and bond market strategists who give Greenspan much of the
credit for the prosperity currently enjoyed by most investors and
consumers across the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the news that Greenspan would stay on at the Fed
was not enough to overcome widespread fears on Wall Street that
rising interest rates will put a crimp in corporate profits. Those
worries contributed to a sharp decline in all the major stock
indexes. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 359.58 points
Tuesday, a 3.17 percent drop and the Nasdaq Composite lost 5.56
percent. Long-term bond yields stood at 6.54 percent yesterday, up
from 6.25 one month ago.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan's accomplishments as Fed chairman for the past 12
years are impressive. He followed Paul Volcker, the legendarily
laconic cigar-smoking central banker who helped crush inflation by
sending interest rates to punishing levels and presiding over the
worst economic downturn since the Great Depression. But Greenspan,
in steering the economy safely through both smooth and treacherous
waters since 1987, has probably become the first central banker to
be given true celebrity status.
</P>
<P>
   His open approach to policy-making _ telegraphing moves the Fed
is planning to make well before they are made _ has been copied by
central bankers around the world. And the confidence he has earned
from investors who believe that Greenspan will be able to meet
whatever challenge lies ahead of him, has made him perhaps the most
effective Fed chairman ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people, even the libertarian economists who don't
even like the Fed will tell you that Alan Greenspan is perhaps the
best chairman the Fed has ever had,'' said Richard Sylla, a
financial historian at New York University's Stern School of
Business.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, most market strategists agree that the challenges
facing Greenspan this year rank among the most formidable he has
had to meet over his tenure at the Fed. Although he is adored at
the moment, all of his fine work could be forgotten if he is unable
to walk the tightrope of maintaining economic growth while keeping
inflation low.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Federal Reserve has a very challenging position to attack
at this stage,'' said James Moltz, vice chairman of International
Strategy and Investment, an investment research firm in New York.
``Clearly, the economy is strong and the financial markets have
been exceedingly robust. But the pace that both the economy and the
market are moving in are not sustainable long-term. As you try to
cool that off, it's a very delicate process.''
</P>
<P>
   How delicate that process is will be topic A when the Federal
Reserve's Open Market Committee meets Feb. 1 and 2 to discuss
monetary policy in the first of eight sessions scheduled this year.
At that meeting, the Fed is widely expected to raise the benchmark
federal funds rate, currently at 5.5 percent, by one-quarter of one
percentage point in what would be its fourth interest rate increase
since June 1999.
</P>
<P>
   When Greenspan took command of the Fed in August 1987 the stock
market crash, which took blue chip stocks down more than 500
points, or about 23 percent, in a single day of trading, was just
two months away. His response to the crisis was to flood the
banking system with funds, ensuring that credit was readily
available to all who needed it. This kept the economy from
stumbling and, as a result, the crash did not lead to a immediate
recession. Greenspan had aced his first test.
</P>
<P>
   The next crisis the Fed chairman faced was the recession of the
early 1990s, when the nation's financial institutions were
teetering on the edge of insolvency. Greenspan slashed interest
rates, allowing the banks to shore up their balance sheets by
borrowing from the Fed at 3 percent and investing in government
bonds paying 5 percent. Thus, he is credited with engineering the
recovery of the 1990s and helping to lay the groundwork for what
will become, as of February, the longest economic expansion in U.S.
history.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan's handling of the global economic downturn that began
in Asia in 1997 and spread to Russia and Latin America a year later
also earned kudos. By cutting interest rates three times in 1998,
he sent a signal that the Fed was there to prevent any fallout from
the Asian financial panic from hitting U.S. shores.
</P>
<P>
   When stock prices pulled out of their dive in the fall of 1998,
Greenspan's popularity on Wall Street was secured. And, as stock
prices climbed ever higher, investors loved him even more.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market falls in love with Fed chairmen and probably
ascribes greater wisdom to them than they deserve,'' said Byron
Wien, chief U.S. strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter.
``Nevetheless, Alan Greenspan has been a remarkably balanced and
sensitive Fed chairman.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the fact that Greenspan is notd adherent to any
particular monetary policy ideology has helped convince investors
that he will do whatever is necessary to maintain the stability of
the financial system.
</P>
<P>
   One of his hallmarks has been the way he and other members of
the Fed go out of their way to clearly warn investors well in
advance of interest rate moves. Prior to Greenspan's tenure,
Federal Reserve policy and its imminent moves were considered a
closely-guarded secret. And Greenspan also learned from his mistake
in springing an interest rate increase on the markets immediately
after taking office in August 1987.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has changed the way central banking has been done in the
past 10 years,'' said Stan Jonas, managing director of Fimat
U.S.A., a broker-dealer in New York that specializes in futures and
derivatives. ``He's been much more specific and open, he has made
the Fed a much more predicable entity.''
</P>
<P>
   In so doing, Greenspan's Fed has effectively let the bond market
take the lead in enforcing monetary policy. This helps the Fed by
making its interest rate moves more acceptable to investors when
they do come. Other Fed chairmen have been more proactive, often
surprising the markets with their moves.
</P>
<P>
   The danger in letting the bond market take the lead on monetary
policy comes when investors begin to believe the Fed is not acting
quickly enough to fight resurging inflation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The negative catalyst that historically has been the most
powerful in the stock market is the perception that the Fed is
behind the curve and that interest rate increases will be more
numerous and last longer than people thought,'' said Christine
Callies, chief U.S. market strategist at Credit Suisse First
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   One of these periods may be just beginning. Gemma Wright, senior
interest rate strategist at Aubrey G. Lanston, an investment firm
in New York, believes that the Fed is going to try to slow the
economy from a growth rate in excess of 5 percent lately to a pace
closer to the 3 to 3.5 percent that it views as non-inflationary.
</P>
<P>
   ``This gets a little trickier now because of the global economic
rebound we're beginning to see,'' Ms. Wright said. ``As economies
in Europe and Asia reemerge, that's going to mean another year and
a half of fairly vigilant monetary policy.''
</P>
<P>
   While the bond market is ready for such vigilance, the stock
market may not be. If a series of interest rate hikes push down
stock prices, that will sorely test investors' ardor for Greenspan.
As a result, he may come to wish he had left the stage when stocks
were at their headiest and the applause was at its loudest.
</P>
<P>
   ``The job of the Federal Reserve chairman is not to win a
popularity contest,'' said Sylla. ``If he's doing his job, he
should be somewhat unpopular some time. Greenspan has been
almost too popular and that's a tribute to what a good job he's
done. If he continues to do a good job, he's likely to be less
popular.''

<P>
   Here are Anne Stephenson's capsule book reviews:
</P>
<P>
   ``TWILIGHT'' &QL; 
By Henry Grunwald (Knopf, $20) &QL; 
Grunwald was vacationing in Italy in 1992 when he went to pour a
glass of later and missed the glass. When he returned to the United
States, his doctor gave him ominous news: He was in the early
stages of macular degeneration, a mysterious condition that affects
some older people and for which there is no cure. ``Macular''
refers to a spot on the retina of the eye. ``As for `degeneration,'
'' he writes, ``the term was extremely depressing, with its
overtones of moral decay.'' His journalistic curiosity outweighed
his apprehension, and Grunwald, former editor of ``Time,'' set out
to learn about the disease that was destroying his sight. He also
became ``a visual glutton, devouring the images around me in order
somehow to hold on to them before they grew even dimmer. The faces
of the people I loved . . . the chance glimpses of youngsters at
play in Central Park, old men in peaceful combat playing chess in
Washington Square.'' He coped through humor (``I joke about all the
ugly things I don't have to see anymore'') and by writing this book
about one of the most poignant episodes in a long and interesting
life. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``RAY GUN'' &QL; 
By Eugene W. Metcalf and Frank Maresca (Fotofolio, $19.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   We mention this one on behalf of two boys with whom New &AMP;
Notable has more than a passing acquaintance (one is 45, the other
is 7), who perused it together and announced that it was one of the
greatest books of all time. The weaponry, of course, went to their
heads. We flattered ourselves to think we'd ne to it, but
after only a few pages _ specifically, it was when we saw the Buck
Rogers Liquid Helium Water Pistol, which we knew at once was too
cool for words _ we became ray-gun zealots and prepared to nominate
Metcalf and Maresca for the Pulitzer Prize. Their book is little
more than pictures of old toy ray guns that will make you smile and
remember a time when little boys provided the sound effects for
their guns and didn't really try to kill anyone. These are grand to
look at and whimsically friendly (witness the Smoke Ring Gun or the
Automatic Repeating Bubble Shooting Gun). The only disappointment
is that you don't get to hold them and fire a few bubbles. Metcalf
has a Web site: www.toyraygun.com. &QL; 
``AMERICAN HOLLOW'' &QL; 
By Rory Kennedy (Bulfinch, $35) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect Appalachia to be a place of in breeds and
six-fingered children, of hillbillies and moonshine, an America
more backwards than backwoods,'' Kennedy writes. ``But in my year
with the Bowlings, I discovered that the truth is not so simple.''
The Bowling family lives in one of the poorest and most isolated
regions of eastern Kentucky. Kennedy spent a year living with the
family while she produced an acclaimed documentary for HBO. This is
its companion volume. Rich with photographs and long passages in
the Bowlings' own words, it is a portrait of disparate things:
family love and physical abuse, poverty and generosity, tradition
and despair, hard work and joblessness. Tying it together is the
Bowlings' deep family loyalty and regard for the land. ``Me and
Bascum might have worked hard, but now that didn't hurt us,'' says
matriarch Iree Bowling, married 50 years. ``I'm 68, he's 69, and
we're still working. And I plan on working as long as my hands will
move and my legs will go. No, I don't consider myself poor _ never
did. I feel like I'm rich, rich as the Lord wants me to be.'' &QL; 
``THE GREATEST GENERATION SPEAKS''  &QL; 
By Tom Brokaw &QL; 
(Random House, $19.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you ever want to tell your life's story, do get Tom Brokaw to
write it for you. He was a lean, mean promotional machine on behalf
of his last book, ``The Greatest Generation.'' Now, he's back with
more. This volume offers memories and letters (many written in
response to ``The Greatest Generation'') from men and women who
weathered the Depression years, fought in World War II, and
returned home to create what Brokaw calls a ``world of broader
horizons'' for their children and grandchildren. Most of it is
presented as an oral history, with people telling their own
experiences and Brokaw providing chapter lead-ins and transitional
paragraphs. As with those in the previous book, these stories of
courage, hard work, tragedy and perseverance are told quietly, with
little fanfare or self-pity. There's plenty to get weepy over.
According to Brokaw, it shows the effect that ``The Greatest
Generation'' had onpeople who lived through those difficult decades
but never told their stories. ``I wrote a book about America,'' he
says, ``and a lot of America is writing back.''

   Back to taxes
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bradley called Tuesday for shutting down corporate tax
breaks worth an estimated $125 billion over 10 years. Special tax
favors to big business ``make the rest of us pay more,'' he said in
New Hampshire. Bradley was known in the Senate for championing the
1986 tax law that eliminated many tax breaks, but before now has
had little to say about tax policy in the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy clout
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore also was camp in New Hampshire, and looking ahead
to an important endorsement from Sen. Edward Kennedy of neighboring
Massachusetts. Gore was to appear with Kennedy today at a Boston
middle school, according to the senator's office. The two then were
to travel to Portsmouth, N.H. An endorsement now would break
Kennedy's long-standing tradition of waiting until after the
convention.
</P>
<P>
   Putting it to Putin
</P>
<P>
   John McCain says acting Russian President Vladimir Putin should
be pressed to end the conflict with Chechen militants under threat
of sanctions. ``I'd state unequivocally that there would be no more
(U.S.) export-import loans, that the United States would not
support any further IMF funding until this thing is brought to some
kind of reasonable conclusion,'' McCain said aboard his campaign
bus in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Too close to call
</P>
<P>
   In New Hampshire, John McCain and George W. Bush are running
neck-and-neck, according to a poll conducted during the last days
of 1999. McCain received support from 36 percent of likely
Republican voters participating in a survey conducted by The New
Hampshire Poll (plus or minus 4 percentage-point margin of error).
Bush was 3 percentage points behind at 33 percent. Fifteen percent
were undecided, and the remaining 16 percent said they would vote
for other Republican candidates. The Democrats' gap is narrowing,
too. Bill Bradley and Al Gore also are in stical dead heat:
42-39 percent, Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   Voters make passes . . .
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bradley famously ignores fashion, but he does pay attention
to appearances. New Hampshire eye doctor Norm Michaud, who is a
Republican, stopped Bradley as he was leaving a speech Monday to
advise him against using his reading glasses in public.
``Half-glasses are why Ted Kennedy was never elected president,''
Michaud said. ``People don't like to look at you peering over
half-glasses. It doesn't make you look trustworthy.'' Bradley shook
the doctor's hand and nodded. ``Thanks. I thought about that,'' the
candidate said. ``That's why I use a TelePrompTer.''
</P>
<P>
   And this guy invented the Internet?
</P>
<P>
   Although most of the country was spared from the Y2K computer
bug, Al Gore's campaign Web site took a hit. The Associated Press
reported that the damage came inside his ``virtual town hall,''
where a message from a supporter was dated ``January 3, 19100.''
</P>
<P>
   If not now _ when?
</P>
<P>
   Warren Beatty is ruling out a run for the presidency _ but not
necessarily forever. ``I'm not running now,'' he said in an
interview in the February issue of Vanity Fair. ``I think the
question is: Can I be effective at another time? Whether that is in
a year, or two years, who knows?''And for now, the actor is also
refusing to endorse anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Wait! Make that American
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bradley made a last-minute change to a speech in New
Hampshire on Monday that, according to the Los Angeles Times,
``kept him out of some trouble'' with the United Auto Workers. In
the prepared version of his speech on technology, Bradley was to
say that the coming explosion in information technology will be
like ``going from a horse and buggy to a Ferrari.'' The reference
to the Italian-made car was changed to the American-made Corvette
when he gave the speech.
</P>
<P>
   The `State of Taxes'
</P>
<P>
   Steve Forbes nabbed the endorsement of 33 New Hampshire anti-tax
activists who dubbed themselves the Anti-tax Coalition for Forbes.
Anti-tax Coalition chairman George Lovejoy said Forbes would scrap
the federal tax code as we know it and put in its place a ``simple
flat tax that would save families of four over $1,600.'' Forbes
criticized George W. Bush's targeted tax cuts as not doing enough.
The Manchester Union Leader said Forbes referred to Bush as the
governor of the ``State of Taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   A name from the past
</P>
<P>
   John Anderson, who won 6 million votes as an independent
presidential candidate in 1980, will be on the ballot again in
California _ this time as a Reform Party candidate. The California
secretary of state's office has confirmed, The San Francisco
Chronicle reports, that Anderson joins Donald Trump on the ballot.
Pat Buchanan has asked that his name be kept off.
</P>
<P>
   Taking the edge off health care reform
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore said that by focusing almost exclusively on health care,
Bill Bradley would jeopardize the economy, as would the
Republicans' focus on tax cuts. As quoted in USAToday: ``If we take
the entire projected surplus over the next 10 years and just blow
it . . . on a single ill-conceived spending plan . . . you'd lose
the opportunity to keep interest rates low and to continue building
confidence in our economic future.'' Said Bradley spokeswoman
Kristen Ludecke: ``It's obvious from Al Gore's attacks . . . that
he lacks the confidence in his own agenda for the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Up in Michigan
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush announced that he'll join his GOP opponents in a
Michigan debate next Monday _ the third debate in less than a week
that will feature all six Republicans. ``It will be three debates
in five days, and I hope the Amerblic can stand it,'' Bush
said.

 &HT;    Sears to focus more on tools, home decor
 &HT;    By Patti Bond and Renee DeGross
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Sears, Roebuck and Co. is poised for another makeover.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say the nation's second-largest retailer may ditch
paint, faucets and other struggling categories to make room for
expanding lines in home decor and tools.
</P>
<P>
   Those moves are expected to help Sears boost its market share
and bottom line. The retailer said Tuesday it expects
fourth-quarter profits to increase about 20 percent from last
year's $1.48 a share, beating analysts' forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   Sears' stock closed up $1.50 Tuesday at $31.56 1/4 on the New
York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which is trying to regain business lost to discount
competitors and Atlanta-based Home Depot, is testing shopping carts
and new store formats to make its mall stores easier to shop.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sears is going through its entire assortment in the spring and
will get out of some things that aren't dominant,'' said Prudential
Securities analyst Wayne Hood in Atlanta. Hood recently met with
the chain's top management, including Chairman and Chief Executive
Arthur Martinez, to review the retailer's plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Customers have been telling Sears that their stores are
cluttered and difficult to shop,'' Hood said. As a result, the
retailer may redesign its racks and signs, plus add centralized
checkout counters, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Hoffman Estates, Ill.-based Sears is mum on its exact
plans, spokeswoman Jan Drummond confirmed it is giving 1,200
shopping carts a test drive in some Midwestern and New York stores.
So far, the results are ``very positive,'' she said, and the carts
are expected to roll out to more stores sometime this year.
</P>
<P>
   Sears is following the lead of competitors such as Target and
Wal-Mart. Such discount retailers have built successful formats by
offering shopping carts, clustered registers and wider aisles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly we're not immune to seeing what the competition is
doing,'' Drummond said. ``And we try to identify successful tactics
and see if they can be adapted.''
</P>
<P>
   Adding carts could be a smart move, based on a study conducted
by America's Research Group Inc. of Charleston, S.C. According to
the market research firm's findings, the average shopper pushing a
cart in mass merchandise retail stores buys 7.2 items, while the
cartless consumer buys just 6.1 items.
</P>
<P>
   Major merchandising changes are on the way, too. In three
Midwest test markets this year, Sears will significantly cut
assortments in paint, faucets, storm doors, lighting and other home
improvement items, Hood said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Sears' cuts will make room for more home decor items,
such as carpet, window treatments and bedding. Sears also will add
mattresses as a revived product line, Hood said.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Sears is beefing up its tool department to regain market
share lost to Home Depot, Lowe's Cos. and other competitors.
Anchored by its widely known Craftsman line, Sears is aiming for a
20 percent increase in tool sales, Hood said.
</P>
<P>
   It's unclear if the home-related changes will affect Great
Indoors, a new home decor chain that Sears launched two years ago.
Long-range plans call for 150 Great Indoors stores.
</P>
<P>
   Sears, with 853 department stores and 2,100 specialty stores,
has struggled with its strategy in recent years. Last year, the
chain scrapped its outdated ``Softer Side'' advertising campaign
and slashed prices on basic merchandise to help revive sales. It
also sold HomeLife, a furniture chain.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its recent attempts at a turnaround, the retailer took a
big blow last fall when it was replaced by Home Depot as one of the
30 Dow Jones industrials.
</P>
<P>
   Like J.C. Penney, Sears is finding that the so-called ``middle
market'' is increasingly elusive. Sears said Tuesday that December
sales at stores open at least one year fell 0.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Drummond, the Sears spokeswoman, declined to elaborate on the
latest round of changes pegged for this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of speculation and recommendation in some of the
analyst reports right now,'' she said. ``This is an ongoing
process. We'll be constantly editing and reviewing our merchandise
assortment and our marketing messages, but we're not ready to talk
about it.''

THREE FROM BOSTON DIE IN MOUNTAIN CLIMBING VENTURE 
</HEADLINE>

 By MARCELLA BOMBARDIERI AND RICHARD CHACON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ They were a newly engaged couple who first met
over their shared passion for mountain-climbing, and a recently
divorced father looking for novel adventures.
</P>
<P>
   The three _ all Bostonians of Russian origin _ set out with
three others for a joyous New Year's hike up the steep, snow-capped
Pico de Orizaba, Mexico's highest mountain.
</P>
<P>
   For all of them, according to friends and family, the expedition
up the 18,700 foot peak was a hunt for both thrills and
self-discovery.
</P>
<P>
   ``In mountains, I feel whole,'' one hiker, Vladimir Smirnov,
once told a fellow mountain-climber.
</P>
<P>
   But this time, Smirnov and his companions would not find peace
atop the mountain. Orizaba claimed all three lives in its icy grip
when a sudden snowstorm swept the climbers away.
</P>
<P>
   Their leader was Smirnov, 29, a mountaineering ``guru,''
according to a member of the hiking club he founded. His fiance,
Irina Libova, 23, was a promising biology graduate student at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology. With them was Ilya Krasik,
42, a mechanical engineer and father of two teenagers who was new
to mountain-climbing.
</P>
<P>
   For unknown reasons, the group separated from their fellow
hikers. While the others took the main path, Smirnov, Libova and
Krasik followed a lesser-known and more dangerous route up the
mountain's eastern face, according to a Russian Embassy official in
Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   When the blizzard hit Orizaba, the threesome _ tethered to each
other with a rope _ slipped and fell, plunging nearly 2,000 feet
before landing in a deep canyon, said Alexander Lapin, press
attache at the Russian Embassy in Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   That was Dec. 28. The search for them over wide and difficult
terrain covered two Mexican states and included help from a Red
Cross helicopter and a group of Austrian mountaineers. It lasted
five days. When the bodies were finally discovered Monday, the
three climbers showed signs of both hypothermia and head trauma,
said one Mexican official who spoke on background.
</P>
<P>
   About 200 miles southeast of Mexico City, Orizaba straddles the
border between the states of Veracruz and Puebla. The cone-shaped
mountain is dangerous because of the snow and wind storms that hit
year-round, said Jaime Molina, a spokesman for the Puebla office of
Mexico's Civil Protection, the agency which recovered the bodies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deaths are frequent up there mostly because of the weather,''
Molina said. ``It's a very difficult zone, even for the most
experienced climbers.''
</P>
<P>
   But Libova and Smirnov did consider themselves experienced.
Smirnov started a loosely-knit club for Russian mountain-climbers
in 1996, and later created a web page for the Black Alpinist
Company, said club member Dmitry Kulish. In Russian, the word
``company'' does not mean ``business'' but rather ``team'' or
``group of friends,'' Kulish said, a post-doctoral researcher at
Harvard Medical School.
</P>
<P>
   Through the web page, Black Alpinist _ named for a Russian
legend about a brave mountaineer _ attracted about 50 members,
mostly Russian, from all over the United States. They had climbed
peaks in Colorado, Utah, Wyoming and Canada, among other places,
said Kulish.
</P>
<P>
   Smirnov wanted members of the club to have proper experience and
training, and he led shorter, preparatory hikes before major
expeditions, according to Kulish. Some of the six climbers who went
to Mexico had trained in the Adirondacks over Thanksgiving, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This happened not because of rush or stupidity or desire to
explore dangerous places,'' Kulish said. ``We believe they did
everything they could. It was just a tragic accident that can
happen when you go do extreme activities.''
</P>
<P>
   Kulish said the group did not consider Orizaba particularly
difficult, although they were aware of the hazards of ice and low
visibility.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Krasik undertook the trek against the advice of two friends
who tried to talk him out of it. He was new to mountaineering,
according to his recent ex-wife, Anne Krasik of Andover, and had
done only some minor hiking over two decades ago, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He thought about it, but he decided to go,'' said Anne, who
remained close to Ilya after their separation and spoke of him
lovingly. ``He's a very trusting person. He probably didn't
understand it was dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   She speculated that her husband, who was living with his
girlfriend in Lynn, Mass. and worked for a Billerica mechanical
engineering firm, was carried away with the possibilities of his
lifestyle change.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was part of him starting this new life as a single
man,'' she said. ``He wanted to feel strong and to feel young.''
</P>
<P>
   Ilya and Anne Krasik emigrated to the US 10 years ago and became
American citizens five years ago. Ilya loved his work, was an avid
runner and was very close to his children, Masha, 19 and David, 17.
</P>
<P>
   Smirnov and Libova met on a mountain-climbing journey and
quickly fell in love, Kulish said. Smirnov, a web developer,
recently moved to Boston from Toronto to share her Cambridge, Mass.
apartment. He received a masters degree in science from the
University of Toronto in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Libova, in her second year of a doctorate program in biology at
MIT, was an exceptional scientist and a vibrant, spirited person,
said Frank Gertler, an assistant professor who worked with her. Her
research into cell migration is soon to be published and has
implications for cancer treatment, Gertler said.
</P>
<P>
   Libova came to America with her family in 1994, according to a
relative, and graduated from Washington University in Saint Louis.

SMUGGLED CHINESE WERE `ENTOMBED' ON CARGO SHIP 
</HEADLINE>
 ALIENS-SPI   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SCOTT SUNDE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ For nearly two weeks, 25 Chinese illegal immigrants
lived ``entombed'' in 40-foot-long containers stored with hundreds
of others in the hold of a mammoth cargo ship.
</P>
<P>
   Just a day away from freedom in Seattle, the stowaways were
discovered through the pluck of a Canadian customs inspector who
managed to detect sounds in the bowels of the California Jupiter as
it was berthed in Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   The find established yet another link in an ongoing
investigation into the smuggling of Chinese nationals into West
Coast ports.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, agents with the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization
Service found 12 illegal immigrants in a container taken off a
cargo ship in Seattle. They also arrested three Chinese men accused
of being smugglers.
</P>
<P>
   Court documents link the find in Seattle with the discovery of
30 Chinese stowaways in two container ships last week in Southern
California. The same documents also linked those discoveries with
the two containers on the California Jupiter.
</P>
<P>
   In every case, the same Hong Kong company, Lap Kei Trading,
shipped the containers filled with illegal aliens to the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   American authorities warned their Canadian counterparts about
what to expect on the California Jupiter. Even so, the discovery
was shocking.
</P>
<P>
   ``It leaves you with a pronounced impression. You are below a
steel deck. You have all of these other containers in that hold
that are all sardined together,'' said Cpl. Grant Learned of the
Royal Canadian Mounted Police. ``At the top of the heap was a
soft-topped container ...''
</P>
<P>
   Agents found 12 stowaways in one soft-topped container at the
top of a stack below decks, and 13 in other soft-topped container
below decks. The holds had no natural light.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't imagine the pitch black for that length of time.''
</P>
<P>
   Above them were dozens of containers on the deck of the
California Jupiter. On the deck were hatches that weigh 20 to 30
tons and can be opened only with special equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were entombed in that container,'' Learned said, ``until
someone removed that hatch.''
</P>
<P>
   The ship had been scheduled to arrive in Seattle Tuesday after a
two-week voyage that took it from Hong Kong to Kaohsiung on Taiwan,
then to Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials seemed certain that the California Jupiter
carried stowaways. A fax from Hong Kong had warned INS officials of
that. Agents found a bill of lading, apparently for the California
Jupiter, in the hotel room used by the three alleged smugglers
arrested Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The information was fairly solid,'' said Bob Coleman, acting
director of the INS in Seattle. ``If it were dope and we had an
investigation going on that was international in scope, I would
say, `Sure, let it come on down.'''
</P>
<P>
   But because stowaways' lives could be at stake, ``it was
appropriate that Canadians offload'' the containers.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a day, the American tip seemed bogus. Canadian
authorities inspected the California Jupiter on Sunday after it
arrived in Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a nutshell, they didn't find any evidence to corroborate
the evidence they received (about stowaways),'' Learned said.
</P>
<P>
   NYK, the Japanese company that owns the vessel, said it carried
2,900 containers. The two carrying stowaways were loaded in Hong
Kong, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   Containers were stacked four or five tiers high on the deck,
with more in the holds, Learned said.
</P>
<P>
   Officers continued to watch the ship Sunday and Monday, when the
Canada Customs and Revenue Agency brought in its deep-vessel
rummage team to search out the narrow spaces between tightly
stacked containers below decks.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the guys that are trained to look for drugs and
other dangerous goods on ships,'' said Susan Schooley, a customs
spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Late Monday afternoon, a customs officer in what Learned
described as a crawlway heard sounds coming from a container.
Through an interpreter, customs officers talked to the stowaways
and asked them if they wanted to come out, Schooley said.
</P>
<P>
   They said they did.
</P>
<P>
   Customs, immigration and RCMP officials worked into the early
morning hours yesterday finding and detaining the 25 immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   More than 50 containers had to be removed, then the 20- to
30-ton hatches had to be lifted.
</P>
<P>
   The conditions that Learned described in the containers were
much the same as INS agents in Seattle found Sunday after opening
the container taken from the OOCL Faith.
</P>
<P>
   Car batteries provided power for dim lighting and fans for
ventilation. There were cases of drinking water and food, which had
begun to deteriorate.
</P>
<P>
   The immigrants slept on thin mattresses. Buckets were used for
toilets.
</P>
<P>
   To make matters worse, the California Jupiter steamed through
rough weather crossing the Pacific, NYK said.
</P>
<P>
   Learned said the 25 male immigrants seemed to be in good
physical condition. Twenty-one are adults; four are teenagers.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian immigration agents took the 25 into custody. There were
no arrests of suspected ss. Canada has had a rash of
Chinese-immigrant smuggling. In the last year, the Canadian navy
has seized four vessels with 600 immigrants on them.
</P>
<P>
   But Monday was the first time that immigrants had been found in
cargo containers.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman said the 25 stowaways found in Vancouver, as well as
other Chinese immigrants smuggled into the West Coast, were likely
destined for New York.
</P>
<P>
   There, the ``snakeheads,'' or smugglers, would likely put them
to work to pay off their passage to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there is any doubt that New York is a criminal
hub and a distribution center for these indentured servants,''
Coleman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people are as slick as any multinational drug group.''
</P>
<P>
   Coleman said the INS may work through the Chinese government to
contact Lap Kei Trading, but he said he could be a paper company.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Lap Kei Trading could not be reached for comment.

A TAUT FRENCH ACTION THRILLER (WITH ROMANCE, OF COURSE)  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 9) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)

   `LUCIE AUBRAC' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1999; directed by Claude Berri. USA Home Entertainment. 116
minutes. Release date: Jan. 25. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ah, the French. In 1943 in Lyon, at the height of the Nazi
occupation, a man jailed for buying sugar and noodles on the black
market gets a note from his wife. ``A third night without you in a
big, hopelessly cold bed,'' it reads. Nothing like a little Gallic
news from home to rally a man. Unfortunately, Raymond (Daniel
Auteuil) is suspected by the state attorney of belonging to the
Resistance, which means he won't be curling up with Lucie (Carole
Bouquet) for quite a while, if ever.
</P>
<P>
   It is at this point that we begin to appreciate the differences
between a thriller from the French director Claude Berri, a student
of the intensely personal in ``Jean de Florette'' and ``Manon of
the Spring,'' and the standard commotion on American screens.
</P>
<P>
   Lucie, a tall woman with steely blue eyes, takes retaliatory
action, but she does so by pedaling her bicycle through leafy
streets to the state attorney's house. Summoning the gentleman from
upstairs, she calmly but imperiously delivers a message in short
declarative sentences. The communication is directly from General
De Gaulle, who is in exile in London. The state attorney can
confirm that by listening for a coded message that evening on the
radio. Raymond is to be released on the morning of May 14 or the
state attorney is a dead man. Is that understood? May 14.
</P>
<P>
   Lucie melts at the sight of Raymond returning up the street, one
of many scenes in which Berri infuses the intimate into what is
essentially a taut action thriller. Earlier Raymond and his
comrades blow up a train. With betrayal a constant possibility,
Resistance fighters circle one another as warily as they stalk the
Germans.
</P>
<P>
   Meeting dates and times are crucial and so much as a half-hour
delay disastrous. But May 14 happens to be the day Lucie and
Raymond swore they would never be apart. ``May 14, I'd rather die
without you,'' Lucie says.
</P>
<P>
   They take their young son on a sojourn to the shore, but it is a
brief reverie. In Paris, a leading Resistance figure is arrested by
the Gestapo with repercussions for the organization throughout the
country. He's a brave man but not young. Can he withstand the
torture? Can anyone? There's an informer. ``The paper in my pocket.
Swallow it,'' a Resistance man hisses as he is led off.
</P>
<P>
   Caught in the same raid, Raymond is soon back sleeping on a cell
floor, covered with cockroaches. The local Gestapo man gives his
face a good going-over with a riding crop.
</P>
<P>
   Life outside is suffused with warm, rich color and sound. Lucie
is pregnant and wanting her man. About the only way to get a
prisoner away from the Gestapo is to create a reason to have him
moved and then try to grab him during transport. One plan is to
lace candy with a typhpoid virus to induce dysentery and
necessitate removal to the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Lucie has another idea. Unaware that she is Raymond's wife,
another set of Gestapo officers listen to her entreaty, which she's
just authoritative enough to bring off. ``I can't be an unwed
mother,'' she says. With Resistance fighters waiting for the return
trip, Raymond is brought from his cell long enough to be married.
How French is that?

WITH STAKES HIGH, COWBOYS WON'T TRAVEL DOWN ROAD OF WORRY
</HEADLINE>

c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Answers to such distressing questions have
become so futile that Deion Sanders won't even pray for one
anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's more to life,'' he said, ``than praying for a road
win.''
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Jones would have you believe the road-tested trends the
Dallas Cowboys established the past 16 weeks mean about as much as
a preseason victory in Monterey, Mexico, in August. Absolutely
nada. These are the playoffs now and Jones is throwing everything
out of that ballyhooed ``shrinking window of opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's going to make a difference because of
what's at stake,'' the Cowboys owner and general manager said. ``If
we play with intensity, playing on the road won't make a material
difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Chan Gailey doesn't know what to make of his highlight
show-to-blooper reel football team. One that wins seven of eight at
home by a 14-point margin and one that found seven different, yet
equally effective ways to blow leads and lose seven of eight road
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's never been the same thing twice in a row,'' Gailey said.
``Miscues, fumbles, it's different things like that that have cost
us. We've played well enough to have leads, but not to finish. If
there were a logical answer I would hope we would have found it.''
</P>
<P>
   If logic had any place in this equation, the 8-8 Cowboys would
be watching the playoffs at home this weekend rather than playing
in them. For Jones' anything-can-happen,
jump-on-board-the-Super-Bowl-bus sermon to materialize, the Cowboys
will have to win three consecutive road games, starting with
Sunday's 11:30 a.m. wild-card game against the Minnesota Vikings
inside the Metrodome, arguably the loudest stadium in the league.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys haven't won three in a row, even two in a row, since
starting the season 3-0. They haven't won away from Texas Stadium
since coming back from 21 points down to defeat Washington in
overtime on Sept. 12. That's seven consecutive losses to teams with
a combined record of eight games under .500.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still a concern, we haven't played well on the road all
year,'' cornerback Darren Woodson said. ``I don't think it changes
from the regular season to the playoffs. We have to create
turnovers and give our offense a chance. That's how you win on the
road.''
</P>
<P>
   The road-ache goes deeper than one season. The Cowboys are 6-18
on the road the past three seasons. They duplicated this season's
misery in 1997 by winning the opener at Pittsburgh and then going
0-for-the road. Last season under Gailey, the Cowboys went 4-4 on
the road, losing their final two.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other than the fact we haven't played well on the road, I
can't answer as to why that is,'' Troy Aikman said. ``I don't think
we go into this game with a mental block thinking we are not going
to play well because we've struggled some on the road this year. I
don't think it has really been much of a factor on the team's
psyche going into these games.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones refrained from using injuries as an excuse, but it does
have some credence. The Cowboys had a 17-0 lead against the Vikings
on Nov. 8, but lost Emmitt Smith and Troy Aikman and then the game.
Michael Irvin went down for the season in a 13-10 loss at
Philadelphia and Dallas blew a 17-3 lead at Indianapolis after
Aikman missed one series with concussion-like symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   Still, they're alive. And it's not completely remote that the
road-whipped Cowboys can pull off a victory. Since 1990, NFC
wild-card teams playing on the road have not needed a prayer. Nine
have won on the road, including the 1991 Cowboys at Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's just hope,'' Jones said, ``Aikman and Emmitt come out to
play the second half.''

 &HT;    Independent hotels unite in new group

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A major Atlanta-based hotel franchising company
Tuesday announced formation of an organization to help independent
hotel operators become more competitive.
</P>
<P>
   US Franchise Systems, which franchises the Microtel Inn &AMP;
Suites, Hawthorn and Best Inns &AMP; Suites brands, developed the
program at the request of the Asian American Hotel Owners
Association. Atlanta-based AAHOA represents 6,600 hoteliers. About
30 percent are independent operators, meaning they are not
affiliated with a franchise.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an inexpensive way for hotels to get some benefits of
being connected to each other,'' said Chief Executive Mike Leven,
who helped found AAHOA more than a decade ago. At the same time, it
will allow USFS to tap into a pool of potential franchisees.
</P>
<P>
   Leven said about 400 hotels would have to sign up for the deal
to break even. USFS will administer the program and make a profit
on fees. Fees are $1,500 per hotel the first year and $1,200 per
hotel the second year.
</P>
<P>
   AAHOA Executive Director Fred Schwartz said most of his members
are of Indian heritage. More than half the hotels that fall into
the budget and midpriced categories are owned by people of Indian
heritage, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The new organization, the Independent Hotel Owners Affiliated,
will allow members to increase business opportunities by becoming
part of a national directory and online reservations network.
Currently many independent hotel operators rely heavily on walk-up
business or on word-of-mouth. They usually are not marketed through
travel agents.
</P>
<P>
   Only members of AAHOA can join the new organization, although
Leven said it might be expanded later to include other independent
operators.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton nominated Alan Greenspan to a
fourth four-year term as chairman of the Federal Reserve on
Tuesday, insuring that a familiar hand will continue steering the
economy even as a new administration takes office next year.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks after John Podesta, the White House chief of staff,
first broached the subject confidentially with Greenspan, Clinton
formally asked the Fed chairman to stay on during a meeting on
Tuesday morning. Greenspan, 73, immediately said yes.
</P>
<P>
   White House aides said Clinton had never considered naming
anyone other than Greenspan to the post, although administration
officials had sounded out Robert E. Rubin, the former Treasury
secretary, at the time he left Washington last summer. Rubin
expressed no interest, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of both parties in the Senate welcomed the nomination
and said Greenspan was likely to be confirmed without any problem.
</P>
<P>
   The news was also applauded by economists on Wall Street, which
has always loved Greenspan for the prosperity he has nurtured even
as it has viewed less charitably his suggestions that stocks are
overvalued. Still, the announcement did nothing to halt the
stomach-churning drop in equities, which was driven in part by
concern among investors that Greenspan will raise interest rates
again next month to slow the economy and avert a buildup of
inflation pressures.
</P>
<P>
   The president's decision was an entirely expected reward for
Greenspan, whose inflation-fighting efforts are widely credited
with providing the foundation for the long economic expansion and,
Tuesday's setback aside, the record-setting bull market.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, Greenspan has had a closionship with
Clinton and his economic policy team. The administration has always
been careful to respect the Fed's independence, and in return
Clinton has reaped the political rewards that derive from low
inflation and interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   But in reappointing Greenspan six months before his term as
chairman expires in June, Clinton was also bowing to the reality
that Greenspan has become an institution in his own right, one
whose support runs so broadly and deeply in Washington and on Wall
Street that the White House was under increasing pressure to make
its decision known.
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, Greenspan has become the very embodiment of the
nation's economic vibrancy, a figure who transcends his own
partisan background as a conservative Republican and one whose
influence and visibility extends far beyond the world of finance.
</P>
<P>
   With the Fed chairman standing at his side during a brief
session with reporters, Clinton praised Greenspan for his role in
nurturing an expansion that next month will become the longest in
the nation's history, with all the benefits it has brought in low
unemployment, rising wages and reduced welfare rolls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, wise leadership from the Fed has played a very large
role in our strong economy,'' Clinton said. ``That is why today I
am pleased to announce my decision to renominate Alan Greenspan as
chairman of the Federal Reserve Board.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said Greenspan's ``wise and steady leadership'' had been
``good not just for the American economy and the mavens of finance
on Wall Street,'' but also for ordinary Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan in turn warmly praised Clinton and his top economic
aides, with whom he has worked closely in overhauling the nation's
banking laws, containing the global financial crisis that rocked
Asia several years ago and monitoring the rapid changes that
technology has brought to the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan has not had any apparent health problems, and he
suggested Tuesday that his enthusiasm for his job was undiminished,
saying he would never tire of trolling through esoteric data and
testing theory against the real world.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like eating peanuts,'' Greenspan said. ``You keep doing
it, keep doing it, and you never get tired, because the future is
always, ultimately, unknowable.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked to comment on the stock market,pan appeared to
hesitate, then declined to answer.
</P>
<P>
   One effect of reappointing Greenspan so early is it frees the
Fed to make its decisions on interest rates in the coming months
withoutng the impression that the chairman's job might hinge
on the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   Most analysts now expect the Fed to raise its federal funds
target rate by a quarter of a percentage point next month, to 5.75
percent, and to continue raising rates later in the year if the
economy does not show clear signs of slowing.
</P>
<P>
   But while a slowing economy might hurt Vice President Al Gore's
presidential campaign, Gore has publicly backed Greenspan's
reappointment for months. The two leading Republican contenders,
Gov. George W. Bush of Texas and Sen. John McCain of Arizona, also
supported keeping Greenspan in the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have long urged President Clinton to reappoint Alan
Greenspan,'' Bush said Tuesday, ``and so I applaud the decision.
Chairman Greenspan's steady leadership is good for the country and
good for our economy.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain also praised Clinton's decision. ``I'm totally in favor
of that and I believe most Americans share admiration and
appreciation for Mr. Greenspan's beneficial affects on our economy
and the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's rival in the Democratic primaries, former Sen. Bill
Bradley, has been lukewarm about Greenspan. The most outspoken
critic of Greenspan in the presidential race has been Steve Forbes,
a Republican, who says Greenspan has been too quick to sacrifice
growth and too slow to recognize that there is no inflation.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   While he has never faced the kind of criticism directed at his
predecessor, Paul A. Volcker, who brought double-digit inflation
under control in the early 1980s, Greenspan has never won universal
plaudits. Labor groups, farmers and manufacturers have always
questioned whether Greenspan is too focused on the Fed's mandate to
achieve price stability and not enough on pr growth and
addressing its other statutory goal of seeking maximum sustainable
employment.
</P>
<P>
   But Greenspan has spent more than a dozen years building his
credibility, starting soon after he took the job, when he faced his
first test, the stock market crash of October 1987. He responded by
making credit easily available to the financial system, helping to
avert any major crisis. He later helped steer the banking system
through a period of hard times brought about by huge loan losses,
especially on real estate.
</P>
<P>
   During 1998, he played a key role in containing the global
financial crisis, in particular by engineering a series of three
quick rate cuts that helped keep the financial system in the United
States from seizing up in panic.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan, who views his job almost as an intellectual quest,
has probably been most influential in recognizing the sweeping
effects that technology is having on the economy and adjusting
monetary policy to take account of the changes.
</P>
<P>
   Although he long had a reputation as an unyielding, orthodox
inflation fighter, Greenspan has never been wedded to any single
model of how the economy works, and in the last few years he has
proven remarkably flexible in his approach.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than adhering to the traditional view that there was a
level of unemployment below which a growing economy would
inevitably generate inflation, Greenspan noted that businesses had
grown far better at cutting costs, in large part because of their
massive investments in computers and other technology.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Greenspan allowed the economy to grow at a robust
pace, driving the unemployment rate down through all the
traditional danger zones _ 6 percent on the upper end, 5 percent on
the low end _ without any evidence that inflation was taking root.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with unemployment hovering just over 4 percent and growth
still running strong, even Greenspan appears to think that the
economy is reaching its limits. But analysts said the economy _ and
the political landscape _ might have looked a lot different if
Greenspan had stuhe traditional approach and kept
unemployment at 5 or 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, Greenspan's greatest contribution has been his
willingness to let the unemployment rate ratchet downward without
quickly jumping on the brakes,'' said C. Fred Bergsten, the
director of the Institute for International Economics, a research
organization in Washington. ``It's a truly historic contribution
that has changed the face not just of monetary policy but of our
economy and its prospects.''

SYRIAN-ISRAELI PEACE TALKS `QUITE PRODUCTIVE' 

</HEADLINE>

<P>
   SHEPHERDSTOWN, W.Va. _ Syrian and Israeli officials overcame
procedural problems early Tuesday and plowed ahead with their peace
negotiations as President Clinton made a return trip to this
secluded college town to oversee their discussions.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton met for about an hour with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak and Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa in what amounted
to their first face-to-face working session.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright also sat in on the
meeting, which had been planned for Monday night but was canceled
because of a Syrian-Israeli disagreement over what issues to
negotiate first.
</P>
<P>
   The session, held at the Clarion Hotel and Conference Center
just outside town, was described as ``quite productive'' by State
Department spokesman James Rubin, who said the exchanges that took
place between al-Sharaa and Barak had ``put the talks clearly on
track.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a comprehensive and rigorous discussion of where we are
and where we need to get to,'' Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that the discussion between the two men, who spoke to
each other in English, set the stage for meetings that will take
place this week among ``committees'' comprised of lower-level
Syrian and Israeli delegation members. Rubin said the committees
will address ``in one form or another'' every issue separating the
two sides.
</P>
<P>
   The committee meetings are expected to cover a timetable for
Israel's withdrawal from the Golan Heights, where new border lines
will be drawn, border security guarantees, water rights to the Sea
of Galilee, and all aspects of normalized relations ranging from
diplomatic and economic arrangements to tourism and cultural
exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to their face-to-face talk, Barak and al-Sharaa also
joined Clinton at an informal social gathering of the Israeli and
Syrian delegations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were quite pleased with how today unfolded in light of the
hurdle we had to overcome yesterday,'' Rubin told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton opened the historic Shepherdstown peace talks Monday in
hopes that isolating the two sides in the rural West Virginia
countryside would force them to address the issues that have kept
Syria and Israel in a state of war since the Jewish state was
established in 1948.
</P>
<P>
   But the talks, a continuation of discussions that began at the
White House last month, foundered Monday night when Barak and
al-Sharaa could not agree on how to proceed.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who had not planned to be here Tuesday, was summoned
back by Albright and arrived by motorcade after a 1 1/2-hour drive
from Washington through a continuous rain.
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving the White House, he sought to play down the
problems involved in getting the peace negotiations off to a good
start, saying that he had ``partly'' been responsible for the
decision to cancel the first scheduled session between Barak and
al-Sharaa. But he conceded that ``there are difficult issues'' the
two sides are hung up on that will have to be resolved if the
Shepherdstown talks are to succeed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll just have to hope that we work it out,'' he said, adding
that both sides are serious about trying to achieve a lasting peace
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Although U.S. officials refused to spell out the details of the
procedural dispute that appeared to get things off to a rocky
start, Rubin said the problem involved ``how to get an agreement on
a work plan'' for the rest of this week. He said the delegations
had come to Shepherdstown prepared to stay through the weekend, but
that the talks could run longer.
</P>
<P>
   The problem that developed on the first day here apparently
involved Syria's insistence that the timing of an Israeli
withdrawal from the Golan Heights be negotiated first before moving
on to Israeli demands that security concerns along its northern
border with Syria be addressed.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with Israel Radio, Cabinet Minister Haim Ramon
said Barak could not be expected to work out a withdrawal plan
without first nailing down a Syrian commitment on specific security
guarantees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The scope of a withdrawal depends on what we will receive in
return,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Barak apparently agreed to a proposal put to him
Tuesday morning by Albright that broke the deadlock and smoothed
the way for his first working meeting with al-Sharaa.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin dismissed some reports that Israel and Syria are being
enticed to continue their talks with promises of U.S. financial and
military aid packages. The administration, according to some
reports, has offered Israel a $17 billion aid package designed to
help implement a peace accord with Syria.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin called the reports ``wildly premature,'' saying that no
carrots of any kind had been offered to either side.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton told reporters earlier in the day that there would be
``some cost'' to the United States associated with implementing a
comprehensive peace settlement in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to determine exactly what that should be,''
Clinton said, stressing that he plans to consult with Congress
about it before any final figures are decided on.
</P>
<P>
   White House Press Secretary Joe Lockhart said that informal
contacts had already begun on that issue with key members of
Congress who understand that the price of peace in the Middle East
for U.S. taxpayers could be high.
</P>
<P>
   Israel, for example, will need aid to help relocate some 18,000
Jewish settlers in the Golan Heights, which Israel captured from
Syria in the 1967 war.
</P>
<P>
   Security posts that will be left behind in the Golan may also
have to be manned by U.S. troops, although Clinton administration
officials have refused to discuss the possibility of a new
peacekeeping mission in the region.
</P>
<P>
   As the talks continued, a caravan of orthodox Jews arrived from
New York and promptly began protesting against any ``land for
peace'' agreement that would return the Golan Heights to Syrian
control. The demonstration took place without incident and was
hardly noticed by the local townspeople.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Jerusalem, meanwhile, Israel and the Palestinians put the
finishing touches on an agreement that will lead to Israeli troop
withdrawal from five percent of the West Bank by Thursday. Another
incremental military withdrawal from an additional 6 percent of the
West Bank will take place Jan. 20.

UNIONS SEEK MORE LOCAL EMPLOYMENT BY RAYTHEON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Five years ago Raytheon Co. gained a much-ballyhooed
state tax break, with a few financial strings attached in the form
of payroll levels it promised to maintain in Massachsuetts.
</P>
<P>
   But those obligations expired at the start of this week,
reigniting a fight over whether the Lexington, Mass. defense
contractor has met the terms of its agreement.
</P>
<P>
   On one side, labor unions who once helped Raytheon get its deal
now are stepping up a campaign to tie continued tax breaks to
employment guarantees. They also want the same rules applied to
non-defense manufacturers who, on Jan. 1, also became fully
eligible for the tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Raytheon is not respecting the intent of the law,'' said
Kathleen Casavant, Secretary-Treasurer of the Massachusetts
AFL-CIO, which is alarmed at thousands of layoffs Raytheon has made
in recent years amid falling profits. Now other companies might
take unfair advantage of the tax changes as well, she said.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, Raytheon says it has met both the terms and the spirit
of its 1995 agreements. But this time around Raytheon may be backed
more strongly by non-defense companies like Gillette Co. and
Polaroid Corp. who say the tax changes have helped their
competitiveness as well.
</P>
<P>
   Gillette spokeswoman Nicola Pugliese said the cuts ``have made
it more attractive to maintain our presence in Massachusetts.'' The
company employs 4,600 statewide, and Pugliese he noted the company
in recent years has invested about $750 million to create and
produce its new Mach 3 razor at plants in South Boston and in
Andover.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these arguments will receive more attention Wednesday at
a statehouse press conference called by State Sen. Susan Fargo,
D-Lincoln. A bill she sponsors would require a manufacturer to
employ 90 percent of the workers it had in 1995 to qualify for the
tax cuts. State revenue officials estimate these cuts saved
manufacturers about $85 million in 1999 out of total corporate tax
collections of $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Fargo said the state has an interest in preserving as many
manufacturing jobs as possible, which pay relatigh wages to
workers who mostly lack expensive college degrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been pretty good to business, but it's the legislature's
job to create tax policies that benefit everybody,'' Fargo said.
</P>
<P>
   Andre Mayer, senior vice president of Associated Industries of
Massachusetts, a trade group, countered that business shouldn't be
seen as a support service. Companies face too much oversees
competition, and too much pressure from shareholders to deliver
high profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reality is that the social function of the manufacturing
sector can no longer be fulfilled,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   To date the debate has chiefly revolved around Raytheon, which
was vocal in lobbying for the tax changes in 1995. Then, rules were
changed so only in-state sales were used to calculate corporate
taxes, and property and payroll no longer counted.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue officials say Raytheon has met its payroll obligations
under the law. But Raytheon angered many onetime allies after it
closed plants in Waltham and Quincy and laid off thousands of
workers while shifting missile-making to Arizona and Florida, where
it says costs are lower. Raytheon has around 14,000 employees in
the state today, just 3,000 of whom are blue-collar, a third of
their numbers five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Zagami, head of the the electrical-workers union that
represents most of the local work force, said he is concerned that
Raytheon often locates jobs overseas to win contracts from foreign
governments.
</P>
<P>
   Today the comapny has just four main manufacturing programs in
the state, he said. ``They promise everything to the British, to
the Greeks. It's time they started living up to the promises they
made here,'' Zagami said.
</P>
<P>
   Raytheon spokesman David Polk said that's unavoidable, and noted
the company has been hired thousands of software engineers and
other skilled employees recently despite the ongoing layoffs.
``We're a global company, and that's the nature of the global
economy,'' he said. ``For a variety of reasons, you try to have the
work force close to the customer.''

<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ Bill Belichick stunned the New York sports
world Tuesday by resigning as the Jets' head coach five minutes
before he was to be introduced at a news conference _ and a day
after he had accepted the position to replace the formidable Bill
Parcells.
</P>
<P>
   The shocking reversal left the Jets, one of the high-profile
franchises in sports _ without a head coach as well as without an
owner. The team is in the process of being sold _ and has created
uncertainty at a moment in the team's history when its future had
seemed so bright.
</P>
<P>
   But to punctuate this drama that turned more bizarre as the day
wound down, Belichick's attorney, Neil Cornrich of Cleveland,
notified the National Football League that Belichick would file a
grievance on Wednesday to void his Jets' contract.
</P>
<P>
   Presumably, that would pave the way to his being interviewed by
the New England Patriots, who on Monday dismissed their coach, Pete
Carroll. The Patriots' owner, Robert Kraft, asked the Jets for
permission soon after to interview Belichick for the post. The Jets
turned Kraft down on the basis that Belichick had succeeded
Parcells after Sunday night's game. The league upheld the Jets'
contention that Belichick was off limits to any other team without
the Jets' permission.
</P>
<P>
   Belichick, in a rambling 55-minute discourse in the team's
auditorium Tuesday afternoon, told an assemblage of news media,
front-office staff and club president Steve Gutman, that he was
resigning because of the ``uncertainty'' of the team's future. He
also said that he had ``issues'' with his contract which
essentially forced him to coach for the Jets or no one else.
</P>
<P>
   But he inferred that the contract could be invalid because it
was signed with the late owner, Leon Hess, and that there also may
have been a change in his status working under Parcells,
</P>
<P>
   Belichick, the highly regarded defensive coordinator who had a
five-year stint as the Browns' head coach, admitted he was
concerned about being in a safe haven as a coach. There was
uncertainty in Cleveland, which lost the franchise to Baltimore
following the 1995 season. He was fired a few months later.
</P>
<P>
   He also implied that he did not know what his role would be
under Parcells, a likely Hall of Fame coach and a dominating
figure. Parcells had promised to act as an adviser rather than as
head of the Jets' football operations, which is his new title.
</P>
<P>
   Belichick also expressed reservations about the stability of the
club under the new ownership, and he pointed out that the process
has gone weeks past what he had been told was the likely Dec. 15
sale date.
</P>
<P>
   So just a few minutes before the news conference, Belichick
walked into Parcells's office and notified him he would not take
the job. Belichick then did the same with Gutman. He handed the
president a hand-written note he had hastily scripted an hour
earlier. According to Gutman, who read the letter to the news
conference, it said in part, ``I have decided to resign as the HC
of the NY Jets.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Here we go again,'' said the outspoken wide receiver Keyshawn
Johnson when he learned the news. ``More uncertainty in the
organization. My fourth head coach in four years.'' Actually,
Johnson has had two head coaches, but Belichick would be the third
and his replacement the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   This was actually the second time Belichick had been the Jets'
head coach. In an odd moment in club history, he was the coach for
a week in 1997, while the Jets were maneuvering to bring Parcells
to New York and out of his contract with the Patriots. The Patriots
had refused to allow Parcells to coach the Jets, so the Jets simply
hired Belichick as the interim coach for a year and said Parcells
would be functioning as an ``adviser.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Commissioner Paul Tagliabue ruled that the Jets could
sign Parcells for 1997 as head coach, but would have to compensate
New England with draft picks-a third- and fourth-round that season,
a second-rounder in 1998 and a first-round pick in 1999. As soon as
that deal was made, Belichick stepped aside and became Parcells's
assistant head coach and defensive coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Jets apparently have the contract in their favor, and
negotiations for Belichick are likely to start immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Belichick's sudden decision evoked memories of the often zany
days when the Jets were a metaphor for losing, an organization that
couldn't get it right.
</P>
<P>
   They ended an 8-8 season last Sunday on the upbeat, with a
fourth straight victory and could look forward to next season with
a core of very good players, many returning from injuries that
dashed playoff hopes this season. But on the next day Parcells
resigned.
</P>
<P>
   That move elevated Belichick to the Jets' head-coaching post
because of a contract he had signed in 1997 when he and Parcells
helped remake the Jets. The contract calls for Belichick to take
over when Parcells stepped down.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, Belichick never had the option of deciding whether he
wanted to coach in New England or here.
</P>
<P>
   He would not say anger over the situation regarding the Patriots
caused his resignation, instead repeatedly using the word
``uncertainty'' to describe the state of the team as his major
reason.
</P>
<P>
   But Belichick also spoke of being led on by Parcells since 1987
with the promise of following him as head coach. They were with the
Giants then. Belichick said that Parcells' had repeatedly changed
his retirement date, and what his role would be. That was an
uncertainty. Then there was the imminent change of ownership, which
Belichick said was supposed to be in place by Dec. 15.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't feel at this time I can lead the Jets with 100
percent conviction,'' he explained.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, he cannot lead anyone else either.
</P>
<P>
   Gutman, the team president, said he had asked the league to
clarify the contract and that the league issued a statement
contending it was valid and that Belichick was the head coach of
the Jets, and thus unable to talk to another team.
</P>
<P>
   Belichick wasd followed at the podium by Gutman, who tried to
conceal his anger at what he had just heard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we listened for an hour and a half to someone in
turmoil,'' said Gutman.
</P>
<P>
   He had thought that in Belichick, Parcells's long-time aide and
considered to be one of the finest defensive minds in the sport,
there was to be a seamless ascension. It had seemed that an
often-troubled franchise had been righted. Just four years earlier
it had been the worst in pro football.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots, meanwhile, declined to comment. A club spokesman
said, ``This is clearly a Jets' matter. We can't comment on anyone
we don't have permission to speak to.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Romeo Crennel, who coaches the Jets' defensive line, said he was
standing in a hallway with linebacker coach Al Groh waiting for
Belichick's speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill walked past and said, `I'm going to resign,''' said
Crennel. ``That was a shock.''
</P>
<P>
   Another assistant, Pat Hodgson, the tight ends coach, wondered
what this would mean for the team's 11 assistants. If a new coach
came from outside the organization, he would likely bring in new
assistants.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always the assistants who get hurt,'' said Hodgson.
``Look what happened in Green Bay on Monday when they fired
everybody. I'm one of the few coaches who goes back to the 1-15
season, and we saw hope for the future when we walked off the field
on Sunday, fans cheering, and a real feeling of accomplishment.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jets have only one assistant with head-coaching experience,
quarterbacks' coach Dan Henning.
</P>
<P>
   And they still have Parcells, who claimed on Monday he had
coached his last game. But Hodgson wasn't so sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure Big Bill will have to step back in here and pull
everything back together,'' said Hodgson. The coaches refer to
Belichick as Little Bill and Parcells as Big Bill. Now there is
only Big Bill. He was unavailable for comment.

   MOZDOK, Russia _ Lying in Hospital No. 1458, a few miles north
of Chechnya, Nikolai Tarasyuk is not alone. Most of the original
100 men in his company have been wounded or killed, or felled by
sickness, he said, and many were also in the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The 20-year-old sergeant said the hospital, located near the
sprawling Russian military base here, was pretty good. But on this
day, it was clearly working at more than full capacity. The
hospital was designed to accommodate 150 patients, but tents have
been erected on a nearby field so it could serve twice that number.
Bandaged soldiers crowded the waiting room.
</P>
<P>
   About a third of the patients were wounded in the recent
fighting, officials said, including 11 soldiers who were
transported here on Tuesday. In addition to battlefield casualties,
many of the patients had fallen sick as a result of bad weather
that has descended on Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Col. Vladimir Sukhomlinov, the chief surgeon of the Russian
forces in Chechnya and the head of the hospital here, said that the
number of wounded soldiers the hospital receives fluctuates from
day to day. He also said the current crowding was partly a result
of bad weather, which has prevented the evacuation of patients
further to the rear.
</P>
<P>
   But there is evidence that as Russian forces have mounted their
campaign to capture Grozny and eradicate the rebels in the southern
Chechnya highland, casualties are on the rise. Sukhomlinov said
that the daily toll was often 20 percent to 50 percent greater than
a few weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Russian spokesmen said that almost 400 soldiers and Interior
Ministry troops have been killed and 1,150 wounded as of late
December. But that is an underestimate. The number of those
reported killed, for example, does not include soldiers who were
wounded on the battlefield and later died of their injuries in a
hospital, Sukhomlinov explained. Nor do the casualties include
Russian soldiers whose bodies have not been recovered and
identified.
</P>
<P>
   Limiting the military's losses is more than a humanitarian
requirement. It is also vitally important for the Kremlin's effort
to maintain public support for its military campaign in Chechnya,
especially since Russia is facing presidential elections in March.
</P>
<P>
   So far, most of the Russian public appears to have accepted the
casualties as the price for subduing Chechnya. But the mounting
toll is becoming more of a public issue. On Tuesday night, Russia's
independent NTV television network showed the emotional funeral of
two officers of the Sverdlovsk militia, who were ambushed during an
operation to seize Grozny.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians say they have inflicted a far higher toll on their
foe, killing thousands of militants. But the militants try to take
their dead with them, and there is no way to verify the Russian
claim.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Tarasyuk's unit has not made the evening news, though it has
been badly chewed up in the fighting in Chechnya. The sergeant said
only eight men from his original 100-man company were still active.
He said seven of the company's 11 armored personnel carriers have
been destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Tarasyuk's ordeal began on Jan. 2, when two companies from the
506th Regiment were ordered to seize the Republican Hospital in
southern Grozny. As the Russian soldiers entered the city at 5
a.m., they noticed a small group of 15- and 16-year-olds wearing
black ski caps similar to their own.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians assumed they were a Russian reconnaissance team and
asked the young men who they were. The men did not answer but
slowly raised their weapons and began shooting. Some of the Russian
soldiers clambered into a trench, only to discover that the
outnumbered rebels were determined to stand their ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did not retreat,'' Tarasyuk said. ``They were
defending.''
</P>
<P>
   He was wounded when he rushed to the side of a comrade who had
been severely wounded, to take him to a tank. Almost immediately,
however, the tank was blasted by a rebel grenade and began to burn.
Tarasyuk was struck in the face by a grenade fragment, and his
platoon commander was also hurt.
</P>
<P>
   After setting up a smoke screen, the sergeant and his platoon
commander crawled 30 yards back to the Russian lines, pulling their
badly wounded friend by his belt. Tarasyuk remembers lifting his
friend into an ambulance and then passing out.
</P>
<P>
   The sergeant said that he was convinced that the Russian forces
would eventually take Grozny. But with his wounds and only weeks
left before he is demobilized, he is not eager to rejoin the
fighting. These days, he seems content to spend his time at
Hospital 1458.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The hospital is part of a network the Russian military has set
up for the conflict. Four tent hospitals are clustered around
Grozny, where the injured are stabilized before being whisked by
helicopter to Hospital 1458 here and similar hospitals at Buinaksk
and Vladikavkaz, also near Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is to provide the maximum protection for our
personnel,'' said Sukhomlinov. ``First aid on the battlefield and
timely evacuation is crucial.''
</P>
<P>
   Collectively, the hospitals have hundreds of hospital beds, and
patients said they were pleased with Sukhomlinov's hospital. But
those facilities are not enough to cope with the sick and wounded
soldiers in Chechnya. Those who need lengthy treatment and
rehabilitation are then moved again to hospitals further in the
rear.
</P>
<P>
   To maximize their chances of survival, Russian soldiers wear
bulletproof vests and have been taught basic first aid. They carry
syringes with powerful painkillers and wrap rubber tourniquets
around the barrels of their automatic weapons.
</P>
<P>
   But the soldiers have often proved remarkably casual. Instead of
helmets, many prefer to wear black ski caps or green bandanas,
copying heroes in American war movies. With rebel snipers on the
prowl, head wounds have increased, Sukhomlinov said.

STUDY SHOWS VEGGIES, BUT NOT FRUITS, REDUCE CANCER RISK 
</HEADLINE>

 By TOM PAULSON  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ We've all heard that a diet rich in fruits and
vegetables can protect against cancer, but scientists at the Fred
Hutchinson Cancer Research Center say this is only half right.
</P>
<P>
   The vegetable half.
</P>
<P>
   In a study on prostate cancer, Fred Hutchinson scientists report
in Wednesday's Journal of the National Cancer Institute that a diet
rich in vegetables _ especially cruciferous veggies such as
broccoli, cabbage and brussels sprouts _ can reduce the risk of
prostate cancer by nearly 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The popular notion of tomatoes as especially protective against
cancer wasn't borne out by the study. Fruits didn't offer any
preventive advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found no protective effect at all from fruits,'' said Dr.
Alan Kristal, an investigator with the center's cancer prevention
research program.
</P>
<P>
   Although their study only looked at prostate cancer risk in
1,230 middle-aged men, Kristal said a growing body of evidence from
other studies of diet and cancer indicates this may also hold true
for other cancers as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it's all in the vegetables,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kristal, along with Drs. Janet Stanford and Jennifer Cohen,
decided to study the presumed preventive effect of dietary fruits
and vegetables on prostate cancer because little had been done on
diet and this cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The only link between diet and prostate cancer that had received
much attention prior to the Fred Hutchinson study was based on a
study done by Harvard University that found a diet high in tomatoes
to be exceptionally protective against prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The H.J. Heinz Co. and other purveyors of tomato products have
made much of the Harvard study, Kristal noted, but follow-up
research has failed to support the Harvard findings.
</P>
<P>
   The Fred Hutchinson study also found nothing special
tomatoes when it came to prostate cancer prevention, he said. But
they did find stunning protective value from cruciferous vegetables
_ members of the mustard family so named because their flowers have
four petals suggestive of a cross.
</P>
<P>
   Kristal, Stanford and Cohen decided to study younger men, ages
40-64, because they believed this would make it easier to separate
dietary risks from the risk of prostate cancer that comes with
advancing age.
</P>
<P>
   They studied 628 men who had been diagnosed with prostate cancer
and 602 men selected as a control group for comparison. A detailed
dietary history was obtained for individuals in both groups and
analyzed.
</P>
<P>
   Kristal said the retrospective study design and analysis was
carefully crafted to protect against study subjects misreporting
past dietary practices. Given that the findings run counter to
common wisdom on the benefits of fruit consumption, he was
confident the results are accurate.
</P>
<P>
   In general, the Fred Hutchinson researchers found that men who
ate three servings (a half cup) of any vegetables daily had a 48
percent reduced risk of prostate cancer compared to those who ate
less than one serving of vegetables per day.
</P>
<P>
   And those who ate at least three servings of cruciferous
vegetables per week, Kristal said, experienced roughly another 25
percent reduction in the risk of prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
   It's not as easy to put a single number on the benefit of eating
cruciferous veggies versus other veggies, he said, because of the
statistical difficulty of comparing risk reduction when
substituting vegetable types.
</P>
<P>
   But the bottom line, he said, is that if you want to prevent
prostate cancer you should eat your cruciferous veggies.
</P>
<P>
   ``And it doesn't matter if they're raw or cooked,'' Kristal
said.
</P>
<P>
   There's chemistry to support these population-based findings as
well.
</P>
<P>
   Cruciferous vegetables, Kristal explained, have an exceptionally
large amount of enzymes (known as GSTs, for glutathione
S-transferases) that stimulate a natural detoxifying and
anti-carcinogenic activity in human cells.
</P>
<P>
   In healthy prostates, he said, GST activity is high. In prostate
cancer cells, Kristal said, GST activity is low or almost
non-existent.
</P>
<P>
   This is merely an observation that lends support to the finding,
he emphasized. Because of the complexity of human metabolism, he
said, the GST link between broccoli and a healthy prostate could be
coincidental.
</P>
<P>
   But such chemical evidence is worth looking at, Kristal said,
and should have been considered more carefully when the benefits of
tomatoes for preventing cancer were touted.
</P>
<P>
   The presumed beneficial chemical in tomatoes (which are
technically fruit) is a carotenoid called lycopene. Tomatoes are
high in lycopene, Kristal said, but lycopene doesn't appear to have
any ability to affect cancer risk.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with all the hype about eating this or that food to
reduce the risk of this or that disease, he said, is that science
really can't tell us that yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``All this business about functional foods is ultimately going
to be wrong,'' Kristal said. ``It's all too simplistic.''
</P>
<P>
   We've evolved to eat a complex and diverse diet, he said, and
all science has been able to show us so far is that we need to cut
down on our fat intake and increase the amount of vegetables we
eat. Go ahead and eat fruit as well, Kristal said, but do it
because it tastes good.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, Kristal's favorite cruciferous vegetables are
brussels sprouts as prepared by Tom Douglas, chef-owner of the
Dahlia Lounge in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Boil and cut in half; saute in butter and serve in balsamic
vinegar with crumbled bacon.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon? Butter fat?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, a little fat is okay,'' Kristal said.

THREE FROM BOSTON DIE IN MOUNTAIN CLIMBING VENTURE 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ They were a newly engaged couple who first met
over their shared passion for mountain-climbing, and a recently
divorced father looking for novel adventures.
</P>
<P>
   The three _ all Bostonians of Russian origin _ set out with
three others for a joyous New Year's hike up the steep, snow-capped
Pico de Orizaba, Mexico's highest mountain.
</P>
<P>
   For all of them, according to friends and family, the expedition
up the 18,700 foot peak was a hunt for both thrills and
self-discovery.
</P>
<P>
   ``In mountains, I feel whole,'' one hiker, Vladimir Smirnov,
once told a fellow mountain-climber.
</P>
<P>
   But this time, Smirnov and his companions would not find peace
atop the mountain. Orizaba claimed all three lives in its icy grip
when a sudden snowstorm swept the climbers away.
</P>
<P>
   Their leader was Smirnov, 29, a mountaineering ``guru,''
according to a member of the hiking club he founded. His fiance,
Irina Libova, 23, was a promising biology graduate student at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology. With them was Ilya Krasik,
42, a mechanical engineer and father of two teenagers who was new
to mountain-climbing.
</P>
<P>
   For unknown reasons, the group separated from their fellow
hikers. While the others took the main path, Smirnov, Libova and
Krasik followed a lesser-known and more dangerous route up the
mountain's eastern face, according to a Russian Embassy official in
Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   When the blizzard hit Orizaba, the threesome _ tethered to each
other with a rope _ slipped and fell, plunging nearly 2,000 feet
before landing in a deep canyon, said Alexander Lapin, press
attache at the Russian Embassy in Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   That was Dec. 28. The search for them over wide and difficult
terrain covered two Mexican states and included help from a Red
Cross helicopter and a group of Austrian mountaineers. It lasted
five days. When the bodies were finally discovered Monday, the
three climbers showed signs of both hypothermia and head trauma,
said one Mexican official who spoke on background.
</P>
<P>
   About 200 miles southeast of Mexico City, Orizaba straddles the
border between the states of Veracruz and Puebla. The cone-shaped
mountain is dangerous because of the snow and wind storms that hit
year-round, said Jaime Molina, a spokesman for the Puebla office of
Mexico's Civil Protection, the agency which recovered the bodies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deaths are frequent up there mostly because of the weather,''
Molina said. ``It's a very difficult zone, even for the most
experienced climbers.''
</P>
<P>
   But Libova and Smirnov did consider themselves experienced.
Smirnov started a loosely-knit club for Russian mountain-climbers
in 1996, and later created a web page for the Black Alpinist
Company, said club member Dmitry Kulish. In Russian, the word
``company'' does not mean ``business'' but rather ``team'' or
``group of friends,'' Kulish said, a post-doctoral researcher at
Harvard Medical School.
</P>
<P>
   Through the web page, Black Alpinist _ named for a Russian
legend about a brave mountaineer _ attracted about 50 members,
mostly Russian, from all over the United States. They had climbed
peaks in Colorado, Utah, Wyoming and Canada, among other places,
said Kulish.
</P>
<P>
   Smirnov wanted members of the club to have proper experience and
training, and he led shorter, preparatory hikes before major
expeditions, according to Kulish. Some of the six climbers who went
to Mexico had trained in the Adirondacks over Thanksgiving, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This happened not because of rush or stupidity or desire to
explore dangerous places,'' Kulish said. ``We believe they did
everything they could. It was just a tragic accident that can
happen when you go do extreme activities.''
</P>
<P>
   Kulish said the group did not consider Orizaba particularly
difficult, although they were aware of the hazards of ice and low
visibility.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Krasik undertook the trek against the advice of two friends
who tried to talk him out of it. He was new to mountaineering,
according to his recent ex-wife, Anne Krasik of Andover, and had
done only some minor hiking over two decades ago, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He thought about it, but he decided to go,'' said Anne, who
remained close to Ilya after their separation and spoke of him
lovingly. ``He's a very trusting person. He probably didn't
understand it was dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   She speculated that her husband, who was living with his
girlfriend in Lynn, Mass. and worked for a Billerica mechanical
engineering firm, was carried away with the possibilities of his
lifestyle change.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was part of him starting this new life as a single
man,'' she said. ``He wanted to feel strong and to feel young.''
</P>
<P>
   Ilya and Anne Krasik emigrated to the US 10 years ago and became
n citizens five years ago. Ilya loved his work, was an avid
runner and was very close to his children, Masha, 19 and David, 17.
</P>
<P>
   Smirnov and Libova met on a mountain-climbing journey and
quickly fell in love, Kulish said. Smirnov, a web developer,
recently moved to Boston from Toronto to share her Cambridge, Mass.
apartment. He received a masters degree in science from the
University of Toronto in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Libova, in her second year of a doctorate program in biology at
MIT, was an exceptional scientist and a vibrant, spirited person,
said Frank Gertler, an assistant professor who worked with her. Her
research into cell migration is soon to be published and has
implications for cancer treatment, Gertler said.
</P>
<P>
   Libova came to America with her family in 1994, according to a
relative, and graduated from Washington University in Saint Louis.

<P>
   Investors wary of rising interest rates seized their huge
stock-market gains in a sell-off Tuesday that drove the Dow Jones
index down 359.58 points and handed the technology-heavy Nasdaq
index the biggest point drop in its 29-year history.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq's 229.41 point decline _ a 5.55 percent loss on the
second trading day in the New Year _ was a sudden reversal after an
86 percent run-up in the index last year fueled mainly by the
enormous gains posted by Internet and computer stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The beating taken by high-flying technology stocks _ Internet
companies Yahoo Inc. and CMGI Inc. each lost 32 points Tuesday _
added to pressure on the broader Dow index, which suffered its
fourth-biggest point drop Tuesday, closing at 10,997.93. The 3.17
percent decline in the Dow's value was nowhere near the largest
percentage declines the market index has faced. The Nasdaq suffered
its eighth-largest percentage decline ever.
</P>
<P>
   The market rout coincided with President Clinton's announcement
that he wanted Alan Greenspan to continue as chairman of the
Federal Reserve Board. Rather than cheer the markets, news that the
popular Greenspan would stay only seemed to refocus investor
attention on interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   Facing another Fed meeting Feb. 2 and 3, many investors who have
seen the value of their stocks climb dramatically were brought back
to earth.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt that we were living in a fool's paradise in
the latter part of December,'' said Larry Wachtel, market analyst
for Prudential Securities. He also noted that an added incentive
for selling now was that investors would not face taxes on their
stock sales until April 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was every incentive to nail (gains) down this week
rather than last week,'' Wachtel said.
</P>
<P>
   Following Monday's slide of 140 points in the Dow, the two
declines amounted to roughly 500 points in an index that had
finished 1999 at a record. The Dow Tuesday ended below 11,000 for
the first time since Dec. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Investment experts speculated that the dive may have begun a
long-expected correction in a market that some believe has reached
unsustainable heights.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're wondering if this is not the beginning of a standard
correction,'' said Pierre Ellis, senior economist at Primark
Decision Economics. ``There has been a big advance and the
interest-rate outlook has deteriorated. There seems to be more and
more of a perception that the Federal Reserve will have to do a
significant number of tightenings this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Propects of higher interest rates slammed technology stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Nasdaq's decline was attributed to a plunge in an assortment of
big winners and big names in technology in 1999. Leading the Nasdaq
slide was mobile phone company Qualcomm Inc. Qualcomm, which rose
nearly 3,000 percent last year, fell 17 1/4 a share Tuesday,
closing at 162 1/16, and was blamed for more than one-quarter of
Nasdaq's decline.
</P>
<P>
   Following Qualcomm in their impact on the Nasdaq were a host of
the nation's premier technology companies, including networking
company Cisco Systems, which fell 6 1/16; and software companies
Microsoft, down 3 15/16, and Oracle, down 10 7/16.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stocks that have made investors a lot of money are going
to turn and move ferociously against them,'' said Mark Minervini of
Quantech Research Group in New York. ``This could be the beginning
of that happening. There could be more to come.''
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks, as a group, were hit hardest, as the Standard
&AMP; Poor's technology sector index lost 5.07 percent. Interest
rate-sensitive financial companies, as a group, fell 4.37 percent.
But even industries such as consumer staples and capital goods
makers lost nearly 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index, which sank 3.83 percent,
only five of the index's 89 industry groups rose. More than seven
stocks fell for every three that rose on the New York Stock
Exchange, the broadest decline since Oct. 15.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a day,'' said William Rhodes, vice president of
investment strategy in the Boston office of Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Investors were jarred by volatile trading during a day in which
volume approached the 1 billion-share milestone. One yardstick of
the US stock market's volatility _ the ``VIX Index'' on the Chicago
Board Options Exchange _ rose to its highest level since Oct. 15,
when the Dow tumbled 288 points.
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks are driving the volatility, Rhodes said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been riding momentum and . . . have gone up the
most,'' he said. ``They had a tremendous reward going up, and they
come down faster because they have the greater volatility.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Fed did not raise interest rates in December, the bond
market has pushed rates higher on its own. Some analysts said the
market's drop was a delayed reaction to a sharp rise in interest
rates in the bond market on Monday as the yield on 30-year US
Treasury bonds hit a 27-month high of 6.62 percent.
</P>
<P>
   US financial markets are in an unusual _ and, analysts say,
fragile _ period in which stocks marched higher last year, despite
a gradual rise in interest rates. The Federal Reserve last year
raised rates three times, pushing them up a quarter-point each time
to the current 5.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, investors fearing the stock market's decline turned
around and put money back into the bond market, pushing yields in
the opposite direction.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-year Treasury yields, which move in the opposite
direction of bond prices, dipped to 6.54 percent.
</P>
<P>
   At its year-end meeting, the Federal Reserve said it would not
raise rates. But central bankers have made clear they are very
concerned about an economy that grew at a breakneck pace in the
third quarter and a stock market whose technology bubble may be
about to pop.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fear and anxiety about interest rates, that the economy
is too robust, and the Fed will be forced to act,'' said George
Cohen, chief investment officer at Cohen, Klingenstein &AMP; Marks.
``If interest rates are higher, the valuation of stocks should be
lower.''

 &HT;    Bush campaign gets boost from former candidate Dole
 &HT;    By Jena Heath
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ Gov. George W. Bush won the endorsement of
former rival Elizabeth Dole Tuesday and attacked Arizona Sen. John
McCain's tax-cut proposal, setting the stage for what promises to
be an increasingly heated battle between the two GOP contenders for
a Feb. 1 New Hampshire primary win.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said his five-year, $483 million  plan would leave
lower-income people with more money than would McCain's proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a difference of attitude,'' Bush said. ``There is a
difference of opinion. He's called my plan too big. So has Vice
President Gore, and I believe my plan not only is just right, it's
realistic, it can get done and it's going to make a big difference
for the families of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said a family of four making $50,000 would get a $2,000
break under his plan and a $200 break under McCain's proposal.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has criticized the Bush plan as too big, but did not
address the figures Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't view Governor Bush's tax cut as too big, I view it as
misplaced,'' he said, while campaigning in New Hampshire. ``Sixty
percent of the tax cut goes to the wealthiest 10 percent of
Americans. That's not the kind of tax relief that I think America
needs.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush pledged to run hard in New Hampshire, where he hasuled 17 days of campaigning before the first-in-the-nation
primary next month. While McCain has blanketed the state, Bush got
early criticism for not campaigning hard enough here.
</P>
<P>
   Dole said she would campaign for Bush in New Hampshire and that
she would urge her supporters to throw their weight behind him. She
traveled to Iowa Tuesday with Bush, who also picked up an
endorsement from Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley.
</P>
<P>
   Still sounding like a candidate, Dole gave a detailed summary of
her support for Bush's positions on education, tax cuts, foreign
policy and defense. She compared him to Ronald Reagan, ``another
governor . . . espousing a conservative philosophy that was as
optimistic as it was inclusive.'' And she said that she and Bush
are ``in sync on the vast majority of issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Polls show that Bush does well with Republican women voters, and
he consistently talks about his wish to make the party more
diverse. He had made reforming public education _ an issue thought
to sit well with female voters _ a centerpiece of his campaign.
Bush did well with women in his 1998 re-election campaign against
Democrat Garry Mauro, and got nearly half the female vote in his
first gubernatorial race against Democratic Gov. Ann Richards.
</P>
<P>
   Bush called Dole _ a former Red Cross chief who served in two
presidential Cabinets _ a ``qualified, capable friend.'' He said he
believes her presence in the campaign will help him achieve his
goal of attracting women to the party. Republicans are fighting the
gender gap, female voters' traditional tendency to throw their
support behind Democratic candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elizabeth Dole brought many new faces and new voices into our
party,'' Bush said. ``And we're better off because of it. I'm also
proud that the most viable woman candidate for president ever was a
Republican woman.''
</P>
<P>
   His praise of Dole elicited cheers and applause from the crowd,
some of whom said later that they would like to see Bush choose
Dole as a running mate should he win the GOP nomination. Others
said they are still deciding whether they will vote for Bush at
all.
</P>
<P>
   Renee Wishinski, a homemaker and independent voter, said Dole on
the ticket might sway her to vote for Bush. ``That would really
break that glass ceiling to the umpteenth degree,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush stuck to his position that it is too soon to discuss ang mate _ and Dole backed him up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's absolutely premature to even speculate on that matter,''
Dole said, adding, ``the party is very fortunate to have a very
large number of talented leaders,'' to choose from. She said she
was ``absolutely at peace'' with her October decision to leave the
race.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if her husband, former Sen. Bob Dole, agrees with her
endorsement of Bush, Dole said that he is ``very supportive of my
decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Dole dropped out of the race after running third in an Iowa
straw poll. She said she could not compete with Bush's money
machine. She had raised $5 million, compared with his then $57
million.

GM MAILING COUPONS AS INCENTIVES FOR BUYERS OF NEW VEHICLES 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ A new and potentially costly marketing struggle broke
out in the auto industry Tuesday as General Motors announced
discount coupons on almost all of its vehicles even as several
other automakers said their sales remained fairly strong in
December, capping a record-setting year.
</P>
<P>
   GM, which is struggling to stede in market share, said
that it would mail the coupons to all owners of its vehicles and to
anyone who had recently expressed an interest in buying a GM car or
light truck by contacting the company's toll-free telephone numbers
or its Web sites. DaimlerChrysler AG executives said they had
immediately begun considering whether to accept the GM coupons for
its vehicles, while officials at other automakers were more
cautious, expressing the hope that their existing incentives would
prove adequate.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate announcement, DaimlerChrysler said Tuesday that
its sales inched up 2 percent in December, while Honda, Nissan,
Mitsubishi, Subaru, BMW and Porsche also announced sharp increases.
GM and Ford are expected to post small sales gains when they
release their results Wednesday, with GM having benefited from
offering discounts in late December to its employees and the
employees of its dealerships. GM, Ford and DaimlerChrysler have all
lost market share to foreign brands in the last year, particularly
to South Korean and European automakers.
</P>
<P>
   The only automaker to appear to have stumbled last month was
Toyota, which reported Tuesday that its sales fell 12 percent in
December compared with results in the period a year earlier. But
Toyota had staged a marketing blitz in December 1998, producing a
brief and unsustainable surge in sales to make the Camry the
nation's best-selling car that year.
</P>
<P>
   Total sales in 1999 appeared to have reached 17 million cars and
light trucks, shattering a record of 16 million that had stood
since 1986.
</P>
<P>
   It was not immediately clear what the overall effect of GM's new
promotion would be on the costs of automakers' incentives because
GM said it was simultaneously reducing existing discounts on some
models. Terry Sullivan, a GM spokesman, said the automaker was not
increasing the overall level of its incentives.
</P>
<P>
   But so-called loyalty coupon campaigns, which are so named
because the main targets are people who are already presumed to be
loyal to a particular automaker, cay turn into marketing
wars because the coupons are extremely powerful tools in
stimulating sales. The last national distribution of loyalty
coupons by GM, in the spring of 1998, produced a surge in sales,
forcing the Ford Motor Co. and DaimlerChrysler to accept the GM
coupons.
</P>
<P>
   Theodor R. Cunningham, DaimlerChrysler's executive vice
president for sales and marketing, said his company was determined
to defend its market share and might decide that its dealerships
would again accept the GM coupons. ``We may just do something like
accept them, but we're not ready to announce that yet.''
</P>
<P>
   GM has an advantage during loyalty campaigns simply because so
many people already own GM cars. The company had 29 percent of the
market last year and used to have even more, reaching nearly 60
percent of the market in the early 1960s. But GM had set a goal of
at least 30 percent last year and preferably 32 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Yet loyalty coupons are costly because they can have the effect
of simply bribing loyal customers to buy their next car a few
months earlier at a lower price and because they can be applied to
many models that are usually free from incentives. The coupons can
be applied through Feb. 29 to the purchase of all GM vehicles
except Saturns, Saabs, 2000 model year full-sized sport utility
vehicles and a few specialty models: the Chevrolet Corvette,
Hummers, EV-1s and medium-duty commercial trucks.
</P>
<P>
   The coupons allow customers to choose one of three incentives:
$500 off the price of a new vehicle; a free, three-year,
36,000-mile maintenance contract; or a free, five-year, 60,000-mile
extended warranty.

HIGH-PROFILE FIRMS TO HELP IN TEXAS A&AMP;M BONFIRE INVESTIGATION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Attn: Colo., Ill., Mo., N.Y.) 
 
By JOHN WILLIAMS 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLLEGE STATION, Texas _ Although it could swell the cost of the
inquiry to $500,000, a special commission investigating the deadly
Texas A&AMP;M Bonfire collapse retained three firms Tuesday experienced
in high-profile forensics.
</P>
<P>
   Between them, the firms have investigated numerous disasters,
including the 1993 World Trade Center bombing in New York City, the
1981 Hyatt-Regency Kansas City cat walk collapse and the 1989 DC-10
crash in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the professional help, the Bonfire commission may miss
the March 31 deadline for the investigation sought by Texas A&AMP;M
University President Ray Bowen because of the enormity of the
project and the fact that more firms must be hired.
</P>
<P>
   Bowen wanted the investigation completed by the end of March to
give the school time to decide whether the Bonfire tradition should
continue and if it does whether changes should be made to the way
the Bonfire is constructed. A delay in the investigation could mean
November's bonfire might have to be canceled because
recommendations cannot be made soon enough to implement them.
</P>
<P>
   Bowen would not comment Tuesday, preferring to withhold judgment
until after the committee makes a final report. But university
spokesman Lane Stephenson said he doubted a delay would cause
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody's going to rush the committee,'' Stephenson said after
the commission's two-hour meeting Tuesday at the university's
Memorial Student Center.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve people were killed and 27 more were injured Nov. 18 when
the 55-foot high tower of logs students were stacking for a pep
rally Bonfire preceding the Texas-Texas A&AMP;M football game toppled
to the ground. Nineteen-year-old freshman John Comstock of
Richardson remains in critical condition at the College Station
Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   The three companies hired by the Special Commission on the 1999
Bonfire, which is trying to determine the cause of the collapse,
will look largely at the structural aspects of the Bonfire, such as
its design and the materials used in the construction.
</P>
<P>
   Yet to be determined is which firm or firms will look at the
human aspects of the tragedy, including the training, supervision
and conduct of those who pieced together the mammoth tower topped
with an outhouse. Included in that investigation will be what role,
if any, alcohol consumption played in the deadly event. The Bonfire
commission has had problems finding a company with the necessary
skills in both safety requirements and behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, an official with one firm retained Tuesday said his
investigation may only be 70 percent complete by the March 31
deadline because there are potentially thousands of documents to
sort through and hundreds of interviews to be conducted.
</P>
<P>
   Houston engineer Leo Linbeck Jr., chairman of the special
commission, said the group will meet again Jan. 18 to get a better
idea of how long the investigation will take and how much it will
cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd prefer to maintain an open mind as to what (the cost)
ought to be when we see what the duration of work is, the number of
people assigned to the work and their billing rate per diem,''
Linbeck said.
</P>
<P>
   Linbeck, spokesman for the five-member commission who asked
other commissioners and contractors not to talk with reporters,
said he was delighted at the qualifications of the three companies
selected Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We literally have the whole country, the world for that matter
... to choose from,'' Linbeck said. ``They are right on point.``
</P>
<P>
   The three firms retained Tuesday were:
</P>
<P>
   _ Kroll Associates of New York, which will serve as the general
team leader, coordinating the activities of the others.
</P>
<P>
   Kroll helped the New York Port Authority investigate security
lapses when terrorists bombed the World Trade Center in 1993. In
addition, the company led the investigation into a financial
derivatives scandal which nearly bankrupt Orange County, Calif., in
the mid-1980s. Kroll also served as the court-appointed special
master monitoring the last Teamster election.
</P>
<P>
   Heading the investigation for Kroll will be managing director
Joseph S. Kieffer, a West Point graduate with an engineering degree
who spent 20 years in the U.S. Army including a stint in military
intelligence. Kieffer also was a special assistant U.S. attorney in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   _ Fay Engineering Corp. of Denver, which will look at all
Bonfires since 1946 to establish a model for how a successful
timber pile is erected. The company investigated the 1981 collapse
of a walkway high above the Hyatt-Regency in Kansas City, Mo.,
which killed 114, two fatal accidents at the Denver International
Airport and a Union Pacific bridge collapse during dismantling
which closed seven railroad lines.
</P>
<P>
   Fay Engineering's investigation will be headed by Vice President
Rex Paulsen. Paulsen was an engineering professor at the University
of Denver under then-Dean John Weese, who is now with Texas A&AMP;M.
</P>
<P>
   Paulsen said piecing together an accurate account of how the
Bonfire is stacked will be difficult because the manual used by
student leaders has no diagrams or blueprints, merely written
instruction. Paulsen said it was unusual for construction of such a
project to lack blueprints.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _  &LR; Packer Engineering of Naperville, Ill., which will try to
determine the structural causes for the 1999 collapse, including
looking at the log count, the quality of the wood, center pole, guy
wires and polls, retaining wires and soil.
</P>
<P>
   Packer Engineering investigated the 1989 crash of a DC-10 that
killed 112 in Iowa, the collapse of a post office in Chicago and
the tumbling of a 605-foot concrete emissions stack on a Texas
Utilities Co. power plant in Monticello in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know what the answer will be,'' said Packer
Engineering Vice President Tage Carlson.
</P>
<P>
   Kroll, Fay Engineering and Packer Engineering were selected out
of a field of six companies by the consulting firm McKinsey &AMP; Co.,
which is performing pro bono work for the commission.
</P>
<P>
   Linbeck said that none of the three firms had financial or
commercial ties to Texas A&AMP;M to the best of his knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   The firms retained by the commission Tuesday must be hired by
university officials, since it is the school that is paying the
bills, Linbeck said. Also, the $500,000 cost of the investigation
is just an estimate at this point, although Linbeck said the figure
might be right.
</P>
<P>
   Texas A&AMP;M is making periodic bonfire investigation updates on
the school's Web site at www.tamu.edu/bonfire-commission.

 &HT;    Funeral retailers fight regulation
 &HT;    By Bruce Hight
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ How much government protection does a consumer
need to buy a box that, once filled, will be buried and,
presumably, never seen again?
</P>
<P>
   Plenty, if that box is to hold a human body, says O.C. ``Chet''
Robbins, executive director of the Texas Funeral Service
Commission.
</P>
<P>
   So late last year he suggested that the commission consider
regulating ``funeral merchandisers,'' companies that sell caskets,
urns, clothing and the like.
</P>
<P>
   His suggestion has aroused scornful criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you need to know to sell a box? Come on _ let's get
real here,'' said Pat Graham, president of the Texas Association of
Funeral Merchandise Retailers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The obvious intent of that (proposal) is funeral industry
protectionism, as far as we're concerned,'' said Graham, who is
part owner of Caskets Plus in San Antonio. He also happens to be --
funeral director himself; he owns Graham Funeral Home in Junction.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Funeral Service Commission already regulates the
funeral home directors, funeral homes and embalmers who prepare
bodies, arrange memorial services and conduct burials. They also
sell funeral merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our state law says that when a family comes into a funeral
home to make funeral arrangements, that that funeral director _
that professional that's waiting on that family _ has to be
licensed,'' Robbins said. ``And part of that process is selecting
funeral merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yet you have others in the merchandising business where the
family will go to, and they don't have to be a licensed individual
_ and I think that's wrong. And I think the public would agree with
me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The funeral merchandise business is growing, helped along by a
rapidly expanding marketplace _ the Internet. Merchandisers are not
the only threat to funeral home sales of caskets. The Casket &AMP;
Funeral Supply Association of America says that despite a growing
population (and thus more deaths), the rising popularity of
cremation kept the number of caskets sold in 1980 and 1996 about
the same: 1.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   All funeral directors want ``is a level playing field,'' said
Jim Garrison, executive director of the Texas Funeral Directors
Association, denying any suggestion that they are trying to protect
casket sales.
</P>
<P>
   Funeral merchandisers say they help consumers save money. Bill
Collier, owner of Collier Casket Store in Austin, said his survey
of 100 families he had served over the past two years showed they
saved, on average, a little more than $1,500 _ a 50 percent savings
or more for many customers.
</P>
<P>
   Graham, who figures there are no more than 25 to 30 retailers in
Texas now selling funeral merchandise, estimates that they handle
5,000 to 10,000 sales a year. Not all of those necessarily involve
caskets, since some use urns for cremated remains.
</P>
<P>
   The funeral merchandise retailers organized last fall after the
Legislature, during the spring, considered a bill that would have
given the Texas Funeral Service Commission the power to regulate
them. The bill, by Rep. David Swinford, R-Dumas, passed the House,
but the section affecting the merchandisers was removed by the
Senate before it was sent to the governor.
</P>
<P>
   Robbins' suggestion won't get anywhere soon: The chairman of the
commission, Austin lawyer Harry Whittington, said the commission
has no authority to require merchandisers to get a funeral
director's license. (To get a license, candidates must take a
course of study, pass state and national exams and pay a fee.) The
Legislature, which does have the authority, won't be back in
session until January 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Garrison, of the Funeral Directors Association, said funeral
directors worry about getting blamed for shoddy merchandise they
didn't sell.
</P>
<P>
   If, for example, a family buys an inferior casket from an
independent retailer _ say, a handle breaks while pall bearers are
carrying the casket from the church _ many of the mourners are
likely to blame the funeral home.
</P>
<P>
   That's why some funeral homes demand a release from the family
if they use someone else's casket, Whittington said.
</P>
<P>
   And if the funeral home has a release and the casket proves
faulty, Robbins said, he has no authority to act on behalf of the
consumer.
</P>
<P>
   Rob Schneider, senior staff attorney with Consumers Union, said
he did not see ``any consumer protection issue that arises from not
regulating the funeral merchandise providers, but I would certainly
be interested in hearing if there were problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Government regulation, Schneider said, can protect consumers but
it can also serve to minimize competition at a time when a
grief-stricken mourner is trying to cope: ``They don't take
advantage of the market like they would if they were buying a car
or a washing machine.''

STOCKS PLUMMET BROADLY ON INTEREST-RATE JITTERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (See related story, CLINTON-GREENSPAN, and column,
GREENSPAN-MARKETPLACE) 
(bl) 
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN and FLOYD NORRIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stock prices fell sharply in the United States and
Europe on Tuesday amid concerns that interest rates will rise
higher than had been anticipated. End-of-year tax moves and
investing strategies were also cited as reasons.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average had its worst day since the
autumn of 1998, when world markets were roiled by Asian economic
problems and the collapse of the Russian ruble.
</P>
<P>
   All the main U.S. indexes fell by at least 3 percent, with the
Dow dropping 359.58 points, or 3.2 percent, to 10,997.93. But the
worst performance, a fall of 5.6 percent, was recorded by the
Nasdaq composite index, which was the best performer of 1999 with a
gain of 86 percent. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index was down
55.8 points, or 3.8 percent, to 1,399.42. There were also declines
of 2 percent or more in most major European indexes and some Asian
markets. But the Japanese market managed a small gain.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Greenspan, who on Tuesday was nominated for another term as
Federal Reserve chairman, is widely expected to push short-term
interest rates up another notch when the Federal Open Market
Committee meets in February, but concern has grown in recent days
that further increases may also be in store after that. In the
past, higher rates have often hurt stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Steinberg, chief economist at Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., said
Tuesday that he expected the Fed to raise rates twice, and added
that ``the risk is for more after that.'' He said the bond market
could fall sharply if the employment report to be released Friday
showed the economy was stronger than expected.
</P>
<P>
   The bond market had fallen sharply Monday, but it regained some
of those losses Tuesday, as stock prices tumbled.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stock market couldn't ignore the bond market forever and
ever, and maybe today is the day,'' said Jeffrey Applegate, the
chief U.S. strategist at Lehman Brothers. He noted that interest
rates, both long-term and short-term, rose during much of 1999,
even as stock prices also increased.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there was little new to explain the sudden fall in stock
prices, a fact that left analysts searching for seasonal
explanations. Investors with large capital gains had a good reason
to delay selling until the new year _ and thus not owe the taxes
until April 15, 2001, rather than selling at the end of December
and owing the money this year. Moreover, institutional investors
may have wanted to buy stocks at the end of the year so that their
year-end portfolios would show they were fully invested, rather
than holding onto cash, and thus had no money left to invest now.
</P>
<P>
   ``This should be seen in the context of the last four to six
weeks, in which there were significant inflows into the market,''
said Abby Joseph Cohen, a partner and chief equity strategist at
Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. ``The magnitude of the selloff is a little
surprising,'' she added. ``But the fundamentals did not abruptly
change from last week to this week.'' Ms. Cohen, who has been the
most bullish, and most accurate, strategist in recent years, has
forecast a gain of around 8 percent for the market this year.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cohen said fears about rising interest rates are overblown.
``Over the last month, bond yields have climbed to a fairly high
level of between 6.5 percent and 6.6 percent, with underlying
inflation at between 2 percent and 2.5 percent,'' she said. ``The
Fed will raise short-term rates, but we don't think there is much
more damage to come at the long end of the yield curve.''
</P>
<P>
   Other analysts painted Tuesday's drop in stock prices as a mild
reaction to the explosive rise recorded in late 1999. ``An awful
lot of money had been made in a very short period of time,'' said
Laszlo Birinyi, who runs his own stock market research firm,
adding, ``This is only a correction.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan is widely respected on Wall Street, given credit both
for saving the banks after they ran into problems a decade ago and
for helping to engineer the current period of economic growth,
which will soon become the longest in the nation's history. ``You'd
have thought the market would go up 300 points on Greenspan's
reappointment,'' said Byron Wien, an equity strategist for Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter. ``The fact the market didn't go up is
troubling.''
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Cliggott, U.S. equity strategist at J.P. Morgan
Securities, said one factor pushing interest rates higher and
stocks lower might be Fed actions to reverse the flow of billions
of dollars into the economy at the end of last year, when the Fed
wanted to assure that the transition to 2000 would go smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   The declines in Europe, which included a 3.8 percent drop in the
leading British index, a 2.4 percent fall in the leading German
index and a 4.2 percent plunge in the French index, were blamed
both on expectations of higher interest rates there and on a
reaction to Monday's declines in U.S. stock prices, when the Dow
fell 139.61 points.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the 1990s, the U.S. stock market had frequent bad
days, but usually bounced back quickly as investors took advantage
of lower prices. For example, on April 19, 1999, the Nasdaq
composite plunged 5.56 percent, virtually the same amount it fell
Tuesday, as technology stocks had an especially bad day. The market
bounced back quickly, recovering the entire loss in two days.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, January has often been a good month for stocks,
but that has not always held true at the beginnings of decades.
Yale Hirsch of the Hirsch Organization, a market research firm,
said the Standard &AMP; Poor's index of 500 stocks has gone up in 33 of
the past 50 Januaries. But the three worst performances, with
declines ranging from 6.9 percent to 7.6 percent, came in 1970,
1960 and 1990.
</P>
<P>
   After two trading days this year, the S&AMP;P 500 is down 4.8
percent, a result in part of big drops in bellwether technology
names like America Online, Oracle and Microsoft. Tuesday, the S&AMP;P
fell 55.8 points.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 small-cap stock index shed 18.04, or 3.6
percent, to 478.38, and is down 5.2 percent in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite, which had been alone in moving to a new
high on Monday, fell 5.55 percent. Internet companies like Yahoo
and CMGI, which were darlings for much of last year, were hammered.
Yahoo fell $32, to $443. CMGI, the Internet holding company, lost
$32 11/16, to $293 3/4. Cisco Systems dropped $6 1/16, to $102.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest losers among Dow stocks included Hewlett-Packard,
off 8| to 108 9/16, American Express, down 5 15/16, to 151 5/16,
General Electric, off 5 13/16, to 144 3/16, and J.P. Morgan, down 6
1/16, to 115 3/8. Financial stocks were especially hard hit. Volume
was heavy, but not spectacular. Volume on the Nasdaq was 1.49
billion shares, while Big Board turnover was 990 million shares.

<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ Putting an aggressive new face on a campaign
that even some supporters have criticized as lackluster, Gov.
George W. Bush on Tuesday showcased the endorsement of his one-time
rival, Elizabeth Dole, and sparred with Sen. John McCain over the
size and scope of their competing tax cut proposals.
</P>
<P>
   The day's events stepped up the struggle for the Republican
presidential nomination and particularly the battle for New
Hampshire where the Texas governor has lost a once formidable lead.
Some recent polls have shown McCain surging to become the
front-runner here, though a new poll now puts the two men in a dead
heat in the nation's first primary state.
</P>
<P>
   With the governor facing second-guessing here about whether he
approached New Hampshire with too much confidence, Bush and his
aides clearly saw Mrs. Dole's willingness to stand smiling at his
side on Tuesday as a coup, and they deliberately staged it for his
first full day of campaigning after the holidays.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Mrs. Dole's remarks seemed intended to address
another frequent criticism of Bush: that he lacked the seasoning or
grasp of the issues to become the country's next president.
Comparing him to former President Ronald Reagan, Mrs. Dole
described Bush as formidable politician whose strength and sense of
purpose should not be taken lightly.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made a career out of being underestimated,'' Mrs. Dole said
of Reagan, whose name she invoked five times in a speech that
dovetailed with the themes and priorities of the Bush campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, we rally to another western governor, just as bold in
challenging the status quo, just as resolved to restore pride in
our institutions, just as determined to be himself,'' Mrs. Dole
said.
</P>
<P>
   Before dropping out of the race for the Republican nomination in
late October, Mrs. Dole waged the most serious campaign for the
presidency that any woman ever had, and she placed second to Bush
in many national polls of Republican voters.
</P>
<P>
   She is thought to have a particular appeal to women,
independents and moderates, who could boost Bush both in the New
Hampshire primary and in the general election ``From the first day
I announced my candidacy, I said that I would run a different
campaign _ one that attracts new faces and new voices to the
conservative cause of the Republican Party,'' Bush said.
``Elizabeth Dole brought many new faces and new voices into the
party, and the political process is better for it.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who appeared at a series of town hall meetings on
Tuesday in New Hampshire, downplayed the endorsement. ``I fully
expect the establishment to be supportive of Governor Bush,'' he
said, casting himself as the candidate challenging the status quo.
</P>
<P>
   In her appearance with Bush, Mrs. Dole sidestepped the question
about whether her husband, Bob, who had been the Republican
presidential candidate in 1996, agreed with her endorsement. ``He
was very supportive of my decision,'' Mrs. Dole said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's aides had promised the governor would begin this year by
seeking to draw sharper distinctions between himself and the
Arizona senator, who has emerged as his chief rival. And that
effort became visible on Tuesday when Bush brought up the issue of
tax cutting after a reporter asked when he would start drawing
contrasts.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has called for a $483 billion tax cut over five years and
said he would provide more tax relief for those in the middle class
than McCain would. McCain has suggested that the Bush plan was too
generous to the rich and could potentially be too costly for the
government.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's called my plan too big,'' Bush said, referring to McCain.
``So has Vice President Gore. I just believe my plan is not only
just right; it's realistic, it can get done and it's going to make
a big difference for the future of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said his plan was the one that would help the middle class
and said, ``This stands in contrast to a tax plan that doesn't
address the middle class, the person making $50,000 with a family
of four in New Hampshire.'' He specified that under his plan, that
family would pay $2,000 less taxes; Bush aides say that under a
plan outlined by McCain this summer, that family would get only
$200.
</P>
<P>
   McCain is to put out a full tax-cut plan next week, but over the
summer he proposed a number of cuts including an expansion of the
lowest 15 percent tax bracket. That bracket, for example, currently
applies to married couples earning up to $42,350 a year. McCain
would raise that income ceiling to $70,000 annully.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Told of Bush's remarks, McCain countered by criticizing his
opponent's proposal as tilted toward the wealthy and said it could
endanger the future solvency of Social Security if the economy is
not as robust as now expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``If all of the surplus is used for tax cuts, then if the
economy doesn't continue to improve, then we would have to take
money out of the Social Security trust fund and or increase payroll
taxes,'' he said. ``I'm not prepared to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain also said that in Bush's plan ``60 percent of the tax
cuts are for the wealthiest 10 percent of America.'' He added, ``I
don't think that's necessary. I want the tax cuts for lower- and
middle-income Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   While Bush would reserve the $2 trillion Social Security surplus
for the retirement system, McCain proposes using it plus 62 percent
of the non-Social Security surplus _ roughly another $620 billion
over 10 years _ to pay for a revamped system including personal
accounts. That approach leaves McCain with relatively little money
out of the general surplus for tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday for the first time he said that his plan would allow
people to put 20 percent of the amount they pay in Social Security
payroll taxes into private investments.
</P>
<P>
   So while Bush is choosing a traditional route of appealing to
Republicans through sweeping tax cuts, McCain is betting that in a
time of prosperity, shoring up Social Security will trump Bush's
tax plan even among the Republican faithful.
</P>
<P>
   McCain also sought on Tuesday to draw his own distinction with
Bush over taxation of sales on the Internet, repeating that he
adamantly opposes taxation of Internet purchases. He said sales
taxes would have cost on-line consumers $561 million over this past
holiday alone when purchasing through the Internet amounted to $11
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Most governors oppose a ban on taxes on Internet purchases
because they fear it would drain sales tax revenues. Bush has
simply said he favors an extension of the current moratorium on
such taxation in order to study the issue. The McCain campaign
plans to begin print advertising this week in New Hampshire
newspapers to highlight the issue.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   After announcing Mrs. Dole's endorsement on Tuesday morning in a
speech in Bedford, Bush and Mrs. Dole flew to Iowa for a series of
appearances in a state whose caucus on Jan. 24 will be first vote
of the 2000 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In Des Moines, she touched on many of the subjects that she
mentioned in New Hampshire, but added another thought. ``On a
personal note, Governor Bush and I share a deep personal faith and
a belief in the power of prayer,'' she said. ``I admire the
governor as he speaks of the importance of God in his own life.''
It was at a debate in Iowa a few weeks ago that Bush, after being
asked what philosopher-thinker most affected his life, said Jesus
Christ.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Dole's endorsement of Bush on Tuesday immediately raised
speculation that she would be considered for Bush's running mate.
But Bush said it was too early to ask about Mrs. Dole's chances,
and Mrs. Dole said it would be premature to say whether she was
interested in the job.

 &HT;    Ware turns about-face on retirement, gets promotion in process
 &HT;    By Shelia M. Poole
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Coca-Cola's success in persuading Carl Ware to extend
his long tenure with the world's largest soft drink company was
roundly applauded by black business and community leaders in
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doug Daft just made a deft move,'' former Atlanta Mayor
Maynard Jackson said after Coca-Cola's new president made the
announcement Tuesday. ``His unretiring and promotion of Carl Ware
is a great step forward for the Coca-Cola Co., and everybody
wins.''
</P>
<P>
   Many observers said Daft, who is expected to be named chairman
in April, had righted a wrong in elevating Ware to head a newly
created global public affairs division. He had been effectively
demoted in a management restructuring last year that no longer had
him reporting to Chairman and Chief Executive Officer M. Douglas
Ivester, who has announced his retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Ware is currently a senior vice president and president of the
company's business in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Ware's supporters include a virtual Who's Who of
African-American business, civil rights and politics.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Dortch, a prominent Atlanta businessman and president of
100 Black Men of America, said the announcement was ``a very smart
move on the part of Coca-Cola.''
</P>
<P>
   Daft and Coke's board ``understand clearly the value that Carl
Ware brings to the company,'' Dortch said. ``It shows their
sensitivity to truly one of their greatest markets, which are the
African-American and other diverse communities.''
</P>
<P>
   Ivester exercised ``poor judgment at the time, considering the
challenges that Coca-Cola had before him and considering all the
years Carl was involved at the company,'' Dortch said.
</P>
<P>
   The company faces a racial bias lawsuit in which plaintiffs
claim African-Americans have been discriminated against in pay,
promotions and performance evaluations. The company denies the
claims.
</P>
<P>
   Dortch credited Ware, who has been with the company for 26
years, with being instrumental in bringing then-recently freed
Nelson Mandela to Atlanta several years ago and organizing a
meeting between black business leaders in Atlanta with their
counterparts in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Civil rights leader Joseph Lowry said he heard several weeks ago
that Ware and Coca-Cola officials were talking about Ware staying
on and expanding his duties.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just very bad timing for the company, coming in the
face of the litigation, to have your top African-American executive
throw in the towel and say `I quit,' '' said Lowry, who said he was
disappointed when the restructuring was announced several months
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Ware is apparently upbeat about the changes, said a longtime
friend and golfing buddy, state Rep. Calvin Smyre (D-Columbus).
Smyre said he met Ware for golf over the holidays in Hilton Head,
S.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``He shared this with me, and he was very pleased in light of
the new leadership at Coca-Cola,'' Smyre said. He said Ware and
Daft have known each other for a while.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Carl and Daft have a relationship, and to me the key
words are relationship and respect for one another,'' Smyre said.
``It's a tremendous blend. Carl loves the Coca-Cola Co.''
</P>
<P>
   But the lawsuit and Ware's very public experience at Coca-Cola
highlight other issues for the beverage maker, Lowry said.
</P>
<P>
   While ``this is a good move, I think they need to follow it up
by putting more African-Americans on the board of directors,'' he
said. ``That's one of the weaknesses of Coca-Cola. For years, they
have had a token member on that board. The fact is that many
companies have not kept up with the times.''
</P>
<P>
   Ware grew up in Newnan and graduated from Clark College (now
Clark Atlanta University) in 1965, with a bachelor's degree in
political science. He also holds a master's degree in public
administration from the University of Pittsburgh and attended
Harvard Business School.
</P>
<P>
   He was elected to the Atlanta City Council in 1973 and served as
president of the council from 1976 until 1979.
</P>
<P>
   In 1974, he was tapped by J. Paul Austin, the Coca-Cola's
chairman, to be an urban and governmental affairs specialist. Thus
began a meteoric rise at the company.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979, Ware was named vice president of special markets for
Coca-Cola USA, with responsibility for expanding African-American
and Hispanic marketing and advertising programs.
</P>
<P>
   That was followed by a series of star assignments from Donald
Keough, president and chief executive of Coca-Cola. In 1982, Ware
was elected vice president of urban affairs with responsibility for
Coke's domestic and international external affairs and
philanthropic programs.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, he was named a senior vice president. With controversy
raging around the explosive demands for U.S. businesses to get out
of South Africa, Keough asked Ware to go to Johannesburg, study the
issues and advise the company on what policy to pursue. Ware
advised the company to divest its holdings to support the
anti-apartheid movement, and the company did so. Coca-Cola returned
in 1994.
</P>

   In an interview earlier this year, Ware recalled a time in 1991
when Keough made his day. ``You have been pretty good about
spending the company's money. How about going out and earning some
money for the company?'' Keough asked rhetorically.
</P>
<P>
   With that, Ware went to Harvard and later took off for London
six months later for on-the-job training. He was named deputy group
president for northeast Europe and Africa in 1991 and was appointed
president of the Africa Group in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   As head of the Africa Group, Ware supervised business relations
and operations in 50 countries. Case sales in the company's
Northern Africa Division grew 14 percent last year, and sales in
its Southern Africa Division grew 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Ivester named Ware to co-chair a diversity advisory
council to monitor the company's employment practices ``to maximize
the benefits of diversity in our work force.''
</P>
<P>
   Ivester formed the council in the wake of a lawsuit filed by
four current and former employees who allege discrimination in pay,
performance evaluations, promotions and dismissals.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola denies the plaintiffs' allegations.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, Ware and a panel of African-American company
executives recommended ways to improve promotions and job
opportunities for blacks at the company.
</P>
<P>
   When Ware joined Coke in 1974, he said he occupied an office the
size of a linen closet and made $12,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   But how things changed.
</P>
<P>
   As of Oct. 30, 1999, he owned 220,875 shares of Coke stock
directly and 37,535 shares indirectly, according to First
Call/Thomson Financial. Those holdings would be valued at around
$14.4 million at Tuesday's closing price of $55.87 1/2.

   Three-time Boston Marathon champion Uta Pippig, banned from
competition last year by the German Athletics Association after a
drug test showed an abnormal testosterone-epitestosterone ratio,
has severed ties with the federation and applied for US
citizenship, according to her agent, Tom Ratcliffe, of Concord,
Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Pippig, who has lived in Boulder, Colo., since 1992, will be
under the drug-testing jurisdiction of USA Track &AMP; Field when she
resumes competition after the German ban expires in late April.
Pippig, 34, has denied taking performance-enhancing drugs. It is
unlikely that Pippig could become an American citizen in time to
compete for the United States at the Sydney Olympics in September.

CLINTON BREAKS IMPASSE OVER AGENDA IN MIDEAST TALKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (With ISRAEL-WESTBANK) 
(nk) 
 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHEPHERDSTOWN, W.Va. _ President Clinton made a second trip here
Tuesday, breaking an impasse between Syria and Israel over the
agenda for their peace talks and convening the first face-to-face
meeting between Prime Minister Ehud Barak of Israel and Foreign
Minister Farouk al-Sharaa of Syria.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's reappearance in this small West Virginia town came
after Israeli and Syrian negotiators bogged down in a dispute over
whether the first topic of discussion would be Syria's demand for
the return of the Golan Heights, which Israel has controlled since
the 1967 Middle East war, or Israel's search for security
guarantees.
</P>
<P>
   Barak knows that if he has any hope of making the return of the
Golan politically palatable in a national referendum, he must be
able to convince Israelis that the buffer zone they have considered
so vital for more than a quarter-century is no longer necessary for
national survival.
</P>
<P>
   American officials said little about the content of the talks,
under the terms of a news blackout that has largely been respected
by both Israelis and Syrians.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton's arrival here plainly indicated that his
intervention was needed just to get substantive discussions going.
After hours of procedural talks, Israel and Syria agreed to discuss
both land and security simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton then held a half-hour ``social event'' in a lounge area
of the Clarion Hotel, where the talks are bing held, inviting a
half-dozen negotiators from Israel and Syria. An administration
official said Clinton talked about the Civil War battle of
Antietam, which took place in Sharpsburg just across the Potomac
River in Maryland, the cost of war and the need for the negotiators
to consider the fate of millions in the Middle East whose lives are
affected by the talks.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday evening, the first meetings were scheduled of four
working committees addressing specific areas of dispute.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they're both very serious,'' Clinton said at the White
House on Tuesday morning, after announcing that he would nominate
Alan Greenspan for a fourth term as chairman of the Federal
Reserve. ``They both want an agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   So does Clinton, who sees an accord as a key element of his
legacy. He was so determined to get here that when winds and rain
prevented a helicopter flight, he drove in a motorcade the 70 miles
from Washington.
</P>
<P>
   His arrival was intended to force the first three-way meeting
with the president, the Israeli prime minister and the Syrian
foreign minister, which failed to take place as planned on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Several officials speculated that the Monday night impasse he agenda may have been designed for domestic political
consumption in both Syria and Israel. If an agreement is reached,
both governments have an interest in showing that they fought over
every point _ even the sequence of the discussions.
</P>
<P>
   Briefing reporters Tuesday, James P. Rubin, the State Department
spokesman, continued to play down the prospects of any early
accord. He said that the goal of the negotiations is to come up
with a core agreement _ which he described as more specific than a
framework but far less detailed than a treaty that would specify
new borders and the specifics of troop withdrawals and security
arrangements. But he expressed doubts that would occur in this
round of talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``You shouldn't read `Great Expectations' or `Bleak House' into
every arrival or departure of the president,'' Rubin said, reaching
for a Dickensian metaphor to describe the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   But despite Rubin's caution, American officials are clearly
preparing for the prospect of an accord _ and coming to grips with
what it might cost American taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   American officials acknowledged that they had begun separate
conversations with Israel over how many billions of dollars in
American aid it would take to upgrade the Israeli Defense Force,
and thus strengthen its deterrent capabilities if it could no
longer depend on the buffer zone of the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
   Reports out of Israel said that Barak had presented Clinton with
a $17 billion shopping list _ everything from AWACs airborne
warning planes to Tomahawk cruise missiles. Rubin called those
reports ``wildly premature.'' He did not, however, say they were
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   In Israel, leaders of the Likud, the weakened opposition, were
quick to attack Barak's presumed call for American aid, saying it
would undercut the country's autonomy and make it more dependent
than ever on Washington's whims.
</P>
<P>
   Moshe Arens, the hawkish former defense minister, said, ``It's
obvious, and I have not heard the prime minister deny, that he is
prepared and committed to giving up all of the Golan Heights. He's
already discussing with the U.S. government the need for $20
billion. Certainly part of it is presumably for Israel leaving the
Golan Heights.''
</P>
<P>
   Also Tuesday, roughly 20 rabbis in Israel issued a religious
ruling saying that Golan Heights was part of the land of Israel,
and thus could not be surrendered in negotiation.
</P>
<P>
   Many Israeli experts say that if the referendum on returning the
Golan Heights were held today, it would probably be defeated. But
that may not mean much, because Barak does not yet have a full
package to sell to the Israeli public.
</P>
<P>
   He hopes the package will include a pullback and reduction of
Syrian forces near Israel's border, more arms and aid from the
United States and more sophisticated early-warning systems to alert
Israel to any Syrian military action.
</P>
<P>
   But Syria has said virtually nothing about how much it is
willing to give. The state-run radio in Damascus said Tuesday,
``Syria is serious about making peace, and it is normal that it
demands an Israeli commitment to withdrawal from all its lands.''
</P>
<P>
   But it did not discuss the price that Syria might have to pay,
whether in pulling back its forces, allowing Israelis to travel
across the country to open an overland pathway to Europe, or
tolerating some economic integration and Israeli diplomatic
presence in the Syrian capital.
</P>
<P>
   The expectation is that those issues will get an airing here
this week, but probably no resolution. It is unclear if Syrian
negotiators will return home for the end of the holy month of
Ramadan this weekend, or whether Barak will return to Israel for an
expected visit this weekend by the former Russian president, Boris
Yeltsin, and the acting president, Vladimir Putin.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is it clear how frequently Clinton, who returned to the
White House Tuesday night, plans to return to push the talks along,
reprising the role he played at the Wye Plantation in talks between
Israel and the Palestinian leader, Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've cleared out the week,'' one of Clinton's aides said.
``If he feels the need, he'll just get on his helicopter.''

CARVED BIRDS CAPTURED BY A CONNOISSEUR'S EYE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 9) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Okla., Texas, Maine, N.J.)   (af)  
 By RITA REIF   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As a boy, Dr. James M. McCleery hunted ducks, geese and
shorebirds with his father, a mailman, near their home in Edmond, a
suburb of Oklahoma City, mostly to put food on their table.
</P>
<P>
   ``He loved birds and animals,'' said his daughter Karen Lynn
McCleery. ``As a teenager he performed minor surgery on birds to
help them. He bred peregrine falcons for a research project in
preservation. To house them, he had our garage converted into a
birdhouse, complete with running water, humidifiers and
air-conditioning. And he left his car outside. When the falcons
weren't soaring in the wild, the garage was falcon heaven. Once,
when a falcon broke its beak, he fashioned a new one. Much later,
after we were grown and gone, he also raised land turtles. He was
never a one-trick pony.''
</P>
<P>
   But for most of his life McCleery pursued his passionate
interest in wildlife as a preservationist and as a collector from
his wheelchair or his bed. In 1950, when he was 25 and a year away
from completing medical school _ he planned to become a surgeon _
he contracted spinal myelitis. He never walked again. After a year
in the hospital, he returned to medical school and switched to
pathology, a specialty he practiced in Pasadena, Texas, until his
death at 74 a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to practicing medicine, he exercised daily on a bar
above his bed, raised falcons and turtles and, for a while, hunted
birds from a wheel chair. A collector of stamps and coins since
childhood, he redirected his focus in 1963 to buying decorative
bird carvings and, later, to acquiring vintage American decoys. He
also made the stands to display them.
</P>
<P>
   Now McCleery's carved birds will be auctioned at Sotheby's in
New York in a sale described by Nancy Druckman, who heads Sotheby's
American folk-art department, as ``the finest private decoy
collection in the world.'' The 450 lots of decoys and 180 lots of
duck-calling instruments, traps, shell boxes, prints and baskets
will be auctioned on Jan. 22 and 23. The sale is expected to total
$5 million to $6 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had been hearing about Dr. McCleery in hushed tones for the
last 20 years,'' Mrs. Druckman said. ``When I saw the decoys, I
realized that he had bought birds incorporating the same sort of
abstraction represented in the best of American folk art: no
doodads, only minimalist styling and great simplicity.''
</P>
<P>
   McCleery's connoisseur's eye was backed up by his intellect and
love of history. With his friend and fellow collector Ronald Gard,
an executive at a financial services firm in Houston, he discussed
1,000-year-old decoys discovered in 1924 in a cave in Nevada, which
are thought to be the oldest known decoys.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was an accomplished student of the history of waterfowling
in this country,'' said Frank Schmidt, a partner in Guyette and
Schmidt, decoy auctioneers of West Farmington, Maine, who helped
organize the sale and wrote the catalog. ``The reason there are so
many decoys in this country and so few everywhere else on earth is
the great concentration of waterfowl in North America. Nowhere else
on earth is there the vast amount of farmland and waterways
producing the vast quantities of grains on which birds feed.''
</P>
<P>
   While most collectors focus on ducks and geese or shorebirds or
on a particular maker or region, McCleery's interest took in all
areas of the country. ``He wanted the best of the best that he
could find,'' Schmidt said. And he often bought pieces after seeing
only an old black and white photograph. His eye had been honed on
studying coins, stamps and slide cultures viewed under a
microscope.
</P>
<P>
   He picked up on things others hadn't noticed: the ragged edge to
the feathering on a duck's back or the splash of white paint that
seemed to lengthen the neck of a Canada goose.
</P>
<P>
   McCleery's presence in the decoy market was first noted in 1973
at the auction of the collection of a New Jersey businessman,
William J. Mackey Jr. At the time it was considered the largest and
finest collection ever assembled. McCleery bid in person at that
sale, at Richard Bourne Galleries in Hyannis, Mass., and he paid a
record $10,500 for a long-billed curlew by William Bowman.
Sotheby's expects it will bring about $250,000.
</P>
<P>
   The record went unchallenged until 1979 when McCleery eclipsed
it, buying a regal-looking Canada goose for $12,500 (now estimated
to bring $300,000). By 1983, the record had risen to $48,400 with
the sale of a sleeping Canada goose by A. Elmer Krowell, a carving
McCleery later bought. It is now estimated to fetch the highest
price in this sale, as much as $500,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decoy market seems poised to move to a significantly
higher level,'' Mrs. Druckman said. ``Wildlife enthusiasts will
continue focusing on decoys and only decoys. But other collectors _
the buyers of paintings by Winslow Homer and the furniture by the
Townsend family of Newport _ will be bidding too.''
</P>
<P>
   That broadening of the buyer pool and the escalation of prices
for decoys has already begun. In 1986, Russell Aitken, the writer
and collector, paid a record $319,000 for a pintail drake decoy
carved by A. Elmer Crowell, and in 1997 David Teiger, a collector
of contemporary art, bought a Massachusetts curlew for a record
$335,000 at a sale by Guyette and Schmidt.
</P>
<P>
   McCleery's collecting put him in touch with hundreds of people _
and they with him. ``For a man who literally lived life in his bed,
his world was larger than that of anyone else I've ever known,''
Ms. McCleery said.

SHARING ITS WEALTH, WILLIAMS WON'T RAISE COLLEGE COSTS IN 2001 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By JODI WILGOREN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   After a decade of booming growth in the endowments of elite
colleges _ and public outcry over the high cost of attending them _
Williams College announced Tuesday that it would keep tuition,
room, board and fees unchanged next year, becoming the first highly
selective institution to do so in decades.
</P>
<P>
   The move by the small liberal arts school in western
Massachusetts was hailed as ``bold'' and ``dramatic'' by experts in
higher education. Several of them predicted that competing
institutions, including those in the Ivy League, would soon follow
suit. While no elite college in at least a generation has kept
total costs flat for two consecutive years _ Williams last did so
in 1954 _ the rate of increases has been falling, in part because
of growing outrage over the staggering prices at prestigious
campuses.
</P>
<P>
   The complaints have become trickier for officials as the soaring
stock market has propelled endowments to unprecedented levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gets harder every year to write a convincing letter to
parents saying that we just have to do this, particularly in the
face of these endowment runups,'' said David W. Breneman, dean of
the Curry School of Education at the University of Virginia. ``I
absolutely think it's about time.''
</P>
<P>
   The endowment at Williams has tripled, from $333 million to more
than $1 billion, since 1990, while tuition and fees have risen from
$20,760 to $31,520 a year (41 percent of the students get financial
aid), a pattern similar to its competitors. Administrators said the
decision not to increase the price in the coming year, which was
announced in a letter as the campus reopened for the winter term,
was simply an effort to share the college's wealth with its
students.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here we are in a low inflation cycle with our endowment
increasing and our contributions from alumni being very strong,''
Carl W. Vogt, the interim college president, said in an interview.
``This just seems a logical move for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Other colleges and universities have frozen or even reduced
costs in recent years _ Muskingum College in New Concord, Ohio,
slashed its tuition by $4,650 in 1996 _ but it has typically
represented an effort by a struggling institution to attract more
students. Williams has no such need: last year there were 5,000
applicants for 500 slots, more than at almost any time in the
college's 207-year history.
</P>
<P>
   But with Congress having established a special commission on the
cost of higher education in 1998, even the most competitive
colleges and universities have been searching for ways to make
themselves more affordable.
</P>
<P>
   Several Ivy League institutions decided not to count the value
of a family home when assessing students' ability to pay, and
Princeton recently promised to provide grants rather than loans for
all students from families with incomes below the national median.
Other institutions have vowed not to raise tuition higher than
inflation for four years, or even to freeze it for families that
pay a large portion up front.
</P>
<P>
   With state governments across the country flush with surpluses,
California, Virginia and Massachusetts recently cut tuition at some
of their public universities, while New York, Mississippi and
Oregon have kept fees steady at some of their institutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is that the rate of increase in tuition and fees has
been declining almost throughout the entire decade,'' said Stanley
O. Ikenberry, president of the American Council on Education, a
coalition of the nation's colleges and universities. ``I think this
will raise the competitive stakes for other institutions to work
even harder to contain costs for themselves and the costs they pass
on to their students.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the College Board, the average overall price for
four-year private colleges has risen 29 percent since 1989, from
$16,538 to $21,339 this year. Last year's average increase was 4.3
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Top-tier institutions have seen smaller increases _ Williams'
price tag rose 3.75 percent last year and 3.5 percent the year
before _ on a larger base. Among the college's competitors are
Amherst ($31,690), Middlebury ($31,600), Pomona ($30,920),
Swarthmore ($31,690) and Wesleyan ($31,630). Ivy League prices
range from $32,243 at Cornell to $34,898 at Princeton.
</P>
<P>
   These are the schools that have also enjoyed remarkable growth
in gifts and ballooning investments because of the strong economy.
College and university endowments totaled $178 billion in 1998,
with 31 institutions, or 6.1 percent, having assets of more thanllion each, according to the National Association of College and
University Budget Officers. The Council for Aid to Education
reported $18.4 billion in gifts to colleges and universities in
1998, the largest total ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``Students ask all the time, `We're sitting on all this money,
why don't we spend it?''' said Benjamin Katz, a junior at Williams
who is the editor of the campus newspaper, The Record. ``This is
finally an answer to that question.''
</P>
<P>
   But Albert Leatherman, co-president of the Williams student
body, said the endowment would be better spent diversifying the
Williams student body with more financial aid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's any act of generosity or Williams going out
of its way to make the college more affordable, it's just a fact of
the American boom,'' said Leatherman, a senior from Moorefield,
W.Va. ``A more extraordinary announcement would have been they're
hiring more faculty, or they're going to give a free ride to 100
students from Appalachia or South Africa or inner-city blacks,
something like that. That's the school's challenge.''

E-Trade Group's purchase of Telebanc Financial Corp. _ a takeover

officials of the two companies said yesterday.
<P>
   The end of December had been viewed as a deadline for combining
the No.2 online broker and the leading bank operating exclusively

after that date with no penalty.
</P>
<P>
   The companies couldn't complete the $1billion acquisition
because federal thrift regulators, which supervise Telebanc of
Arlington, Va., didn't complete their review. All the same, E-Trade
and Telebanc officials expect to get a go-ahead soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both companies are extremely committed to the deal,'' said
Telebanc Chief Executive Officer Mitchell Caplan. ``We will be
prepared to close within a matter of hours after getting
approval.''
</P>
<P>
   E-Trade spokesman Patrick Di Chiro said the Menlo Park company
is ``focused on closing this as soon as possible.``
</P>
<P>
   The federal Office of Thrift Supervision should rule on the
transaction by the middle of February, according to the agency's
standard timetable. Last month, the agency notified E-Trade and
Telebanc that their purchase application was complete, a step that
usually signals approval is coming.
</P>
<P>
   Buying Telebanc is vital to E-Trade's strategy of expanding from
an online brokerage to an Internet vendor of an entire spectrum of
consumer financial products. The Web-based bank, which has more
than 100,000 customer accounts, offers checking accounts and
federally insured certificates of deposit.
</P>
<P>
   While an OK has always been considered likely, analysts said
E-Trade's acquisition of Telebanc, announced in June, raised issues
regulators scrutinize carefully. Brokerages are considered riskier
than banks, and regulators undoubtedly want to ensure that E-Trade
has the management resources to run an institution that has federal
deposit insurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``This application hit on a couple of OTS hot buttons,'' said
U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray analyst Stephen Franco.
</P>
<P>
   E-Trade and Telebanc fed speculation that their deal could be in
jeopardy by refusing until recently to say what they would do if
they missed the December 31 closing deadline.

<P>
   LIJIANG, China _ The two old men now live in a small research
center in this stunning mountain town, translating religious
scriptures of their minority culture from a pictographic script
that almost nobody else can fully decipher anymore.
</P>
<P>
   These men are the last of the dongba _ priests of the Naxi
people who have lived in Lijiang and the surrounding mountains of
southwestern China with their own animist religion and writing
system for more than 1,000 years. Now they are helping to compile
an accessible record of their sacred knowledge before it dies out
altogether.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as the late 19th century, at least 1,000 men were
trained as dongba among a population lower than today's 280,000
Naxi (pronounced nah-shee), say researchers. Until the late 1940s,
community life was dominated by frequent ceremonies such as
sacrifices to the wind and animal spirits, exorcisms, funerals,
medical rituals and more, at which costumed dongba chanted some of
the hundreds of scriptures and danced in intricate patterns taught
through the centuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dongba religion was once like an encyclopedia that taught
you everything,'' said one of the old men, He Kaixiang, who at 76
still has a healthy shock of gray hair and looks more like a
retired government official than a shaman. ``But these days, there
are no more dongba, and the rituals aren't carried out anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he began studying the writing and scriptures at age 12,
in 1935, and after years of apprenticeship became, in the usual
pattern, a part-time shaman while he farmed by day. He led
ceremonies in his village right up to 1949, when the victorious
Communists started to suppress what were seen as superstitious
rites.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the Chinese government officially supports minority
cultures as long as they do not challenge the state, and Yunnan
province, where Lijiang is located, proudly trumpets the rich Naxi
heritage in its tourist brochures.
</P>
<P>
   If any minority culture were in a position to thrive here, it
would seem to be that of the Naxi. Their mountain valley, guarded
by a snow-capped sacred peak, is often likened to the mythical
Shangri-La, while Lijiang, with its preserved old quarter, gurgling
canals and elderly Naxi women in traditional blue dress, has become
a major tourist stop. Young Naxi guides tell Chinese and foreign
tour groups about the pictographs and the dongba, and a few dances
have even been revived for viewing.
</P>
<P>
   But as He lamented _ along with He Jigui, 76, his fellow dongba
in the research center _ no one genuinely practices the rituals
anymore, and only a handful of elderly men can properly interpret
the written scriptures that describe ceremonial chants and tell the
elaborate Naxi story of human origins. (The two men, like many
Naxi, share the surname of He but are unrelated.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Lijiang and dongba culture are very much in vogue; a lot of
tourists are coming, and that's mostly a good thing,'' said Zhao
Shihong, 45, the director of the Dongba Culture Research Institute
in Lijiang, where the two old men live and work.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there's a risk that commerce and tourism will turn the
dongba culture into just a performance, or a bit of packaging,''
said Zhao, who is a Naxi. ``While there's a lot of interest in the
external aspects of Naxi and dongba culture, the internal aspects
may be lost.''
</P>
<P>
   Zhao has directed an exhaustive cultural salvage operation that
began in 1981, with 10 surviving dongbas aiding in translations.
Now, with all but 3 of those 10 dead _ and 1 of those 3 over age 90
and returned to his village home _ the results are starting to
appear: a 100-volume collection of Naxi scriptures, in the original
pictographs with phonetic pronunciations given in the Naxi
language, and translations into Chinese. The first 50 volumes have
just been published by the Yunnan People's Press, with the next 50
volumes scheduled to appear in the coming year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only the Naxi have this kind of writing,'' Zhao said, ``and
it's only the dongbas who really understand the script.''
</P>
<P>
   But knowing the literal meaning of each pictograph, as some
scholars do, is not enough to grasp the full meaning of the
stories, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When these dongbas die out, there will be no one who can
understand these scriptures,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Politics, economic change and the inescapable influence of
China's majority culture have all helped doom the dongba tradition.
</P>
<P>
   When the Communists took over China in 1949, Lijiang was still
isolated and traditional. The new rulers tried almost from the
beginning to discourage native practices and then in the frenzy of
Mao's Cultural Revolution, 1966 to 1976, the suppression became
brutal, with native dress as well as religion outlawed.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was young, the dongba ceremonies weren't talked about
and nobody dared to think of reviving them,'' said He Shiwu, 48,
leader of Xia Shuhe village, south of Lijiang. During his youth,
the rituals were condemned as a superstitious culture of ``snake
demons and cow-spirits,'' said He in an interview at his village
home, his shoes covered with the blood of the pig he had just
butchered.
</P>
<P>
   With China's loosening after Mao's death in 1976, older people,
especially women, began again to wear traditional Naxi dress,
although to this day most of them also don the blue Mao caps they
wore in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Dongba practices sporadically revived, but have fallen away as
trained dongbas age and a new generation seeks money and modernity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Young people like me don't really know much about the dongba
culture,'' said a 20-year-old shopkeeper in Lijiang, her
8-month-old baby on her back, expressing a typical attitude.
``Since I never knew much about it in the first place, it's hard to
feel much of a loss.''
</P>
<P>
   In a rare effort to revive at least parts of the dongba
tradition, Xia Shuheis training a number of young men in
traditional dances.
</P>
<P>
   They are instructed by 70-year-old He Wenzhen, who studied some
of the 60 Dongba dances in the late 1940s but did not master the
scriptures.
</P>
<P>
   But no one really expects efforts like this to do much more than
preserve the memory of an unusual heritage.
</P>
<P>
   He Kaixiang, one of the elderly dongba who works on translations
at the research center and paints pictographs to sell to tourists,
said his own two sons, now aged 40 and 35, were both farmers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're busy making a living for their own children,'' he
said, ``and they're not interested in the dongba culture.''

 _ SF CHRON  
 Intel's Web Devices to Bypass Microsoft OS  &HT;     By Henry Norr 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
In another sign of the tectonic shifts changing the computer
industry, Intel today will announce plans to build ``information
appliances'' that aren't PCs and don't depend on Microsoft
software.
<P>
   The new devices, the first of which should become available
around the middle of this year, will combine Web access with
enhanced telephony features, such as caller ID and voice mail.
</P>
<P>
   They will be branded as Intel products, but Intel won't sell
them directly to users. Instead, it plans to sell them to telephone
companies, Internet service providers and possibly e-commerce
vendors, who in turn will rent, sell or even provide them ``free''
_ as part of a bundle of paid services _ to their customers.
</P>
<P>
   About the size of a small computer monitor, the devices are
designed to sit on a kitchen counter or den desk, rather than be
used for mobile communications. Intel plans a variety of models,
including some with standard CRT monitors and others with sleeker
but more expensive flat-panel LCDs
</P>
<P>
   Intel will show off ``concept'' models _ early prototypes of
possible designs _ at the annual Consumer Electronics Show, which
opens tomorrow in Las Vegas. The machines will have Intel Celeron
microprocessors, but they will rely on Linux, the freely
distributed, ``open-source'' operating system, instead of Windows
98 or any of its siblings.
</P>
<P>
   And instead of Microsoft's Internet Explorer, the built-in Web
browsing software will run Mozilla, the open-source browser derived
from Netscape's Navigator. In contrast to the PC model, users won't
be able to add additional software on their own, though network
providers will be able to customize the environment and, if they
wish, add other Linux-based software programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``A year ago, I don't think Intel would have done this,'' said
Michael Slater, founder of the Microprocessor Report, a Sebastopol
newsletter. ``Then, they were still trying to present the PC as the
center of everything and only grudgingly acknowledging a role for
other kinds of devices. But now, I think they've finally recognized
that the PC just can't be fixed enough to become the kind of
simple, reliable device that an appliance has to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Linux, Slater said, has three big advantages for devices like
the ones Intel is developing: ``First, they don't have to pay
royalties; second, because it's open source, they can customize it
to do just what they want it to; and third, it tends to run day
after day without crashing, which you can't say about Windows.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Claude L'Eglise, vice president and general manager
of Intel's home products group, which developed the appliances,
they are aimed primarily at households that don't have a personal
computer, though some may also serve as second Internet-access
terminals for families that already have a PC or Mac. While roughly
50 percent of households in the United States now a computer, in
Western Europe and Japan the figure is only 20 to 25 percent, and
in Eastern Europe and the rest of Asia, it's well below 20 percent,
according to L'Eglise.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the devices will be designed for use on conventional
phone lines, while others are intended for high-speed digital
subscriber lines. Modelted in Europe will have readers for
``SmartCards,'' credit-card-size devices widely used there for
authentication and personal information.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the devices, Intel this week will show software that
will enable network operators to manage and update the appliances
over the network. L'Eglise said the company has put extra effort
into making the devices as upgradable as possible, because one
factor that has deterred many customers from buying a PC is fear of
obsolescence.
</P>
<P>
   Intel's plans could bring it into competition with some of its
best customers in the PC market. Acer and Compaq have recently
shown somewhat similar devices known as ``Web companions,'' and
other major PC-makers such as Dell and Gateway are developing
similar devices.

COMMENTARY: A LEAP IN THE DARK 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By PAUL KRUGMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Economists have a rather Zen-like view of stocks. They believe
that investors are rational, and that stock prices are therefore
unpredictable. It sounds peculiar, but the logic is ironclad.
Rational investors would take into account everything they know _
all the information available about where profits, interest rates,
technology and so on are going _ when buying or selling stock. So
stock prices would already reflect all available knowledge, and
would change only when new information came in. And new information
is, by definition, unpredictable _ otherwise it wouldn't be new _
which means that changes in stock prices would be unpredictable
too.
</P>
<P>
   Except, of course, that real investors aren't entirely rational.
Being human, they are driven by fear, greed and the madness of
crowds. In principle this should create patterns in stock prices,
and in principle you can use those patterns to outperform the
market. Good luck. But while it may be very hard to tell whether
the market is overvalued or undervalued (remember that Alan
Greenspan warned of ``irrational exuberance'' when the Dow was at
about 6,500), one thing is for sure: It fluctuates more than it
should. That is, instead of rising or falling only when there is
real news about the future, stocks surge and plunge for no good
reason. People sell because other people are selling, or buy
because other people are buying. (It's called ``momentum
investing'' when the market is rising; it's called ``panic'' when
the market is falling.) And as a result it's more a series of
random leaps than a random walk.
</P>
<P>
   And Tuesday, of course, was a case in point. On what was
basically a slow news day, markets suddenly dived, with the Dow
falling more than 3 percent and the Nasdaq more than 5. It didn't
rate some of the headlines it generated _ when a market that has
risen around 90 percent over the previous year falls 6 percent,
this is not exactly a ``meltdown'' _ but it was a pretty big
movement to occur without anything happening to change your
fundamental view about what is going on in the U.S. economy. (OK,
one group of investment analysts released a report predicting
higher interest rates over the next year _ but there was no
particular reason to think that these analysts knew anything that
the rest of us don't.)
</P>
<P>
   Why was the market so easily spooked? Presumably because
everyone _ me included _ is even more confused than usual about
what stocks are really worth these days. On one side, the U.S.
economy has been practically wallowing in good news for the last
few years: productivity has been soaring, allowing the economy to
grow far faster than seemed possible without running out of labor,
and anyway we seem to have mysteriously acquired the ability to
employ people previously regarded as marginal without setting off a
bidding war for the more obviously qualified workers. And with
clever new applications of silicon chips coming out every day, it
is easy to become, well, exuberant about the future.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, as any financial theorist could tell you,
good news that you already expect to hear isn't news. Five years
ago, a 2 percent annual increase in worker productivity would have
been regarded as excellent, and stocks would have risen sharply on
the report; today it would be regarded as a disappointing
performance, and would drive stocks down. In fact, current stock
prices already have built in the expectation of economic
performance that not long ago we would have considered incredible;
performance that is merely terrific would be seen as a big letdown.
</P>
<P>
   So which will it be - terrific or incredible? We all have our
opinions _ being a pessimist by nature, I think that things will be
merely terrific _ but nobody, and I mean nobody, really knows. And
a rational market would accept this ignorance, and wait for some
actual evidence in favor of one side or the other.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it doesn't work that way. Tuesday, something _ if I
knew what, I would be a lot richer _ caused investors to become
slightly less convinced than they had been the day before that we
are living in the best of all possible worlds. And the result was a
huge destruction of paper _ um, I mean virtual _ wealth.
</P>
<P>
   But hey, it's still a terrific economy. Or do I mean incredible?

 Bay Area IPOs Ruled in 1999  
 By Peter Sinton 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
The New Year celebrations from Sydney to Paris to San Francisco may
have been spectacular. But they don't hold a candle to 1999's
initial public offering fireworks.
<P>
   Last year, 126 Northern California companies sold stock to the
public for the first time, and the average gain from offering price
to end of trading on December 31 was a stunning 358 percent.
</P>
<P>
   One out of four U.S. IPOs was launched locally last year, and
their average gain was nearly double the 191 percent average
increase for all 504 IPOs, according to IPO Monitor.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, in 1998 only 41 Northern California companies went
public and gained a mere 90 percent on average. Nationwide, 379
IPOs were launched and gained just 20 percent on average.
</P>
<P>
   Last year was the best performance ever. The number of local
IPOs that soared more than 10 times their offering price exceeded
those that declined even a penny. Indeed, 13 companies saw their
stock prices increased at least 900 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Leading the pack was Commerce One of Walnut Creek, which soared
to $196.50 from $7, after adjusting for a 3-for-1 stock split last
week.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly three-quarters of all local IPOs _ 92 to be exact _ at
least doubled in price. And only 11 closed the year below where
they started.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year was unprecedented,'' said David Golden, co-managing
director of investment banking at San Francisco's Chase H&AMP;Q, which
lead managed 24 IPOs for an average gain of 182 percent. ``In 1999,
anyone with an interesting business plan that had Internet or
dot-com in their name could find capital.''
</P>
<P>
   In 2000 and 2001, Golden said, companies will need more than
that to launch successful IPOs. ``They will need proprietary
technology or market dominance plus good management and strategic
partners.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Nasdaq set another record last year, more than half the
companies that trade on Nasdaq lost value. Golden said a similar
``have and have-not'' dichotomy faces the next crop of IPOs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Technologically innovative companies and ones with strong
brands and revenue growth will have another good year,'' he
predicts, especially if they focus on business-to-business Internet
solutions and equipment and services to make communications
pipelines run more efficiently.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the steep stock market decline yesterday and Monday,
which took a big bite out of many recent new stocks, ``the market
has shown incredible resiliency over the past 18 months,'' said
Revell Horsey, director of equity capital markets for Banc of
America Securities. ``It would be a mistake to rush to judgment and
conclude the (bull) run is over.''
</P>
<P>
   He notes that venture capital firms are flush with cash to
invest in new high-tech startups, a backlog of 190 companies are
waiting to launch their IPOs, and both institutional and retail
investors ``have an incredible appetite for increasing equity
exposure, especially aggressive growth and small-cap companies.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Horsey believes there could be ``a dramatic
sorting out.'' He figures investors will stick with the premium
companies in each sector while weaker competitors, also called
``momentum players,'' could get slaughtered.
</P>
<P>
   The hottest IPOs of 1999 were clustered around the booming
``B2B'' business-to-business electronic commerce market, which
Forrester Research predicts will mushroom from $109 billion in 1999
to $1.3 trillion in 2003. That's more than 10 times Forrester's
estimate for business-to-consumer transactions three years from
now.
</P>
<P>
   The hottest IPO of the year was Internet Capital Group, a
Pennsylvania holding company that invests in B2B companies. Its
stock rocketed 2,733 percent to $170 from $6, after adjusting for a
stock split. It just edged out Commerce One, which climbed 2,707
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Nine other Bay Area companies were among the top 16 IPOs
nationwide. They include Brocade Communications Systems, the San
Jose networking-equipment-maker, which jumped to $177 from $9.50;
Liberate Technologies, the San Carlos maker of software to enhance
delivery of Internet content to information appliances, which shot
to $257 from $16; and Redback Networks, a Sunnyvale high-speed
networking systems provider, which popped to $177 from $11.50.
</P>
<P>
   Commerce One is a leading provider of electronic commerce
solutions that link buyers and suppliers of goods and services with
a trading network on the Internet. The company serves as a one-stop
shopping center for corporate customers such as General Motors,
British Telecommunications, Nippon Telegraph and Pacific Gas and
Electric. They can buy everything from telecommunications gear and
office supplies to travel and professional services.
</P>
<P>
   Commerce One CEO Mark Hoffman says customers might save 10 to 15
percent on their purchases by automating their procurement
procedures and reducing inefficiencies related to phone- and
fax-based manual purchasing procedures.
</P>
<P>
   From 1996 through last September, Commerce One has lost $72
million on about $21 million revenues. Hoffman, 53, whose stock
options would be worth close to $350 million if they all vested
yesterday, does not expect profits until the fourth quarter of next
year. Nevertheless, analysts and investors believe Commerce One and
rivals including Oracle, Ariba and SAP will be big winners in
helping businesses operate more efficiently using the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Commerce One now has a market value of $15.8 billion _
double the $7.9 billion market value of PG&AMP;E Corp., which earns
close to $700 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   One major reason behind fast-rising Internet-related stocks like
Commerce One has been a shortage of shares. Even though a record
number of dot-com companies has gone public and more individual
investors are using online brokerage services to get into the
market, newly public companies often sell only 10 or 15 percent of
their total shares to the public. Executives, employees, venture
capital and other early investors hold the rest.
</P>
<P>
   Few investors can buy the limited number of shares at the
offering price. That creates a situation where prices soar once the
general public bids up the scarce shares on the first day of
trading. Indeed, many of the biggest gains occur in the first few
frenetic hours of trading as investors who got shares at the
offering price sell their stakes for a quick profit.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly two-thirds of the average 447 percent gain for 85 Bay
Area IPOs tracked by Davis Skaggs last year came during the first
trading day.
</P>
<P>
   Before 1999, no startup company had been worth more than $3
billion after the first day of trading, according to Renaissance
Capital. In 1999, 14 companies hit that lofty mark.
</P>
<P>
   However, not all IPOs soared. The worst performer among Northern
California's rookie public companies was Valley Media Inc. The
Woodland (Yolo County) music and video entertainment products
distributor slipped 56 percent from its $16 IPO price to $7. The
company's earnings in the past quarter slipped to $335,000 from
$415,000 in the year earlier period on $205 million sales.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, many of the dot-com companies that have captured
investors' hearts and dollars do not expect profits for years.

SPORTS COLUMN: BELICHICK A MASTER OF X'S, O'S AND NOW WHY'S

<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ There are three shadows hanging over Bill
Belichick.
</P>
<P>
   The first shadow comes from the past, from Art Modell, who used
Belichick in those last ugly days in Cleveland and then never
invited him on the moving van to Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   The second shadow comes from the future, from Charles Dolan, or
whoever buys the New York Jets.
</P>
<P>
   The third shadow blots out the light _ morning, noon and
afternoon _ and is not going away. That ongoing shadow belonged to
Bill Parcells, the once and maybe even future coach of the Jets,
and it caused Belichick to commit one of the most shocking
resignations in the history of sports Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Other coaches have quit impetuously, but Belichick elevated his
departure into an earthquake, seemingly out of nowhere. He informed
club officials literally minutes before he walked into a news
conference that was supposed to have been his introduction as the
Jets' new head coach.
</P>
<P>
   Belichick is going to be vilified by Jets fans and admirers of
Parcells, and surely there are no innocents here, since Belichick
is about to take legal action with the National Football League to
break his contract. It is also true that Belichick has reason to
feel his world changed when Leon Hess died last May 7, and then
again on Monday when the Jets suddenly made him head coach, to ward
off interest from New England. That mousetrap block left Belichick
very much in the looming shadow of Bill Parcells.
</P>
<P>
   Belichick took the high road, talking about ``uncertainties''
with the franchise, soon to be sold by the Hess estate. He spoke
with reverence of ``Mr. Hess,'' and with apparent fondness for
Parcells.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have talked to Bill for the umpteenth time,'' Belichick
said, referring to Parcells' frequent talk of retiring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took it with a grain of salt,'' Belichick said.
</P>
<P>
   He knows Parcells as well as almost anybody, having spent 14
years with Parcells hurling objects and invective at his assistants
while goading them to win. Inevitably, Belichick was seen as
Parcells' acolyte, the brainy defensive assistant who helped the
Giants win two Super Bowls and helped the Patriots reach the Super
Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Belichick is that most rare pro football bird, a graduate of
Phillips Andover Academy and Wesleyan College, who learned the game
from his father, Steve, a longtime assistant at the Naval Academy.
His wife, Debby, and their three children endured the fans' insults
during the last year of Modell's denials in Cleveland. When
Belichick followed Parcells to New England, the family bought a
home in Nantucket, and began to dream of stability.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife has been pretty thrifty,'' Belichick said. ``She's
clipped some coupons. We can get by for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   As much as they liked New England, Belichick came to the Jets as
the man who would be the head coach as soon as Parcells had enough.
The question was, would Parcells ever have enough?
</P>
<P>
   Belichick is an X's and O's guy who spends 12 to 16 hours a day
in the bunker. On Monday he felt himself hemmed in by defenses as
taut as any of his own.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots were firing Pete Carroll and wanted to speak to
Belichick, which was their legal right as long as he was still an
assistant. They were going to offer more power than Belichick might
ever have with the Jets, no matter who owned them.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells, who had done a superb job of pulling the team together
and who had more color in his face than a year ago, suddenly had a
motive for not coaching. After a whirl of negotiations, Parcells
agreed to stay on as something called ``the head of football
operations.''
</P>
<P>
   It was clear from listening to his words Tuesday that Belichick
had huge problems with that scenario. A new owner would walk in on
the first day and want to ask a few questions about his expensive
new toy. Who would be the first person he would consult? A two-time
Super Bowl winner. Without any bad will on Parcells' part,
Belichick would still be the acolyte.
</P>
<P>
   The two men spoke on Monday, in an atmosphere that may have been
somewhat less than friendly, although Belichick put a positive
public spin on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill said, `I don't know what my role will be,''' Belichick
said. ``Bill's been great. He told me, `If you feel that undecided,
maybe you shouldn't take this job.' I took Bill's words to heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday Belichick insisted he was not breaking a contract,
saying: ``The understanding I had was with Mr. Hess. The situation
has changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he could coach anywhere else, Belichick said, ``I'm no
lawyer, but there are plenty of them and I'll let them deal with
that, but I have a lawyer talking to the league.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Gutman, who has been running the Jets for the Hess estate,
had been standing jovially in the doorway when he was suddenly
informed that Belichick was leaving. Later, after hearing
Belichick's explanation, Gutman said Belichick's contract was
``clear, meticulous, unimpeachable, unambiguous.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The uncertainty of his family I can't address,'' Gutman said.
``He's obviously in some turmoil.''
</P>
<P>
   Gutman asserted that Belichick could not coach anywhere for
three years, but there remains the question of whether Belichick
could be a general manager in New England, doodling a few defenses
and sending them to his coaches.
</P>
<P>
   Belichick clearly wants to coach again, but not in the shadow of
an owner he never anticipated, and not in the shadow of a mentor
who shows no signs of going away. &QL;

KENNEDY EXPECTED TO ENDORSE GORE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOMERSWORTH, N.H. _ With New Hampshire set to vote in the
nation's first primary in less than a month, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy
of Massachusetts, the reigning liberal voice in Washington, plans
to endorse Vice President Al Gore for president on Wednesday, aides
to the two Democrats said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy was not seriously expected to endorse Gore's rival,
former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey. But his recent praise of
Bradley in Boston was interpreted as a signal that Kennedy might
not make an endorsement at all, alarming the Gore campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Denial of an endorsement, particularly by someone so closely
allied with the Clinton administration, could have suggested severe
weakness for Gore. He is already imperiled in the relatively
liberal Northeast, where polls show Bradley's support to be the
strongest. That includes New Hampshire, where Gore is running
slightly behind Bradley in the Feb. 1 primary.
</P>
<P>
   Gore had been seeking Kennedy's endorsement for months, and when
the senator seemed to be wavering, his campaign stepped up its
pressure to make the endorsement sooner rather than later.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic officials said that while Gore and Kennedy shared a
media adviser in Bob Shrum, a longtime Kennedy associate, the
driving force in procuring the endorsement was Tony Coelho, Gore's
campaign chairman, an indication of just how important the Gore
camp perceived the endorsement. Michael Whouley, the top Gore
strategist in New Hampshire and a longtime Boston political
operative, was also instrumental.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign hopes that Kennedy's endorsement will serve as a
stamp of approval on Gore proposals, particularly on health care
and education, and will suggest his preference in working with Gore
over working with Bradley. Kennedy was not particularly close to
either Gore or Bradley while they were in the Senate, but he had
tremendous respect for Gore's late father, Al Gore Sr. The elder
Gore seconded Kennedy's nomination to be the Senate majority whip
in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   The senator and the vice president are to appear together
Wednesday at a school in Dorchester, Mass., Whouley's hometown,
then travel together to Portsmouth, for a second appearance in
front of the television cameras.
</P>
<P>
   After word of Wednesday's planned event leaked out, Gore was
questioned here by reporters. He said he did not want to pre-empt
the senator, but added: ``I don't think anybody in the modern
history of America has really accomplished more in the United
States Senate over the course of their career than Ted Kennedy has,
and I hope to earn his endorsement.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether endorsements make a difference, Gore said they did
only if they were coupled with support at the grass
</P>
<P>
   This has been perhaps the biggest criticism of the Gore
campaign, that it is top-heavy with endorsements but has generated
little enthusiasm among average voters.
</P>
<P>
   The Bradley campaign advanced that view on Tuesday. ``We thought
all along Gore would have more of the establishment support,'' said
Kristen Ludecke, a spokeswoman for Bradley. ``Bill Bradley has the
support of the people.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   With the imprimatur of one of the nation's leading liberals, Mr.
Gore opens himself to accusations that Bradley has forced him to
the left, away from the center that he has wanted to stake out.
</P>
<P>
   But the Gore campaign dismissed such concerns on Tuesday, saying
that the Kennedy name was a big benefit in a Democratic primary and
that it could appeal to precisely those voters whom Bradley has
attracted.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Shaheen, Gore's chairman in New Hampshire and the husband
of the state's governor, said the senator's endorsement would be
particularly helpful in southern New Hampshire, home to many former
residents of Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a liberal wing of the Democratic party that comes from
Massachusetts that still affiliate themselves with being from
Massachusetts that are very proud of the credentials Senator
Kennedy holds,'' Shaheen said.
</P>
<P>
   ``No moderate or conservative Democrat is going to be upset
because Ted Kennedy sees the value'' in endorsing Gore, he added.
The significance, he said, is that it sends a message to liberal
supporters of Bradley that they ``better take a second look at this
guy and think about whether you really want to win the general
election or not, because I don't believe Bill Bradley can win the
general election.''

VILLAGE VOICE IS SOLD TO INVESTOR GROUP

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Village Voice, the 44-year-old alternative
newspaper that became an icon of journalistic iconoclasm, has been
sold to a group of investors who are installing the current
publisher, David Schneiderman, as chief executive of a new company,
Village Voice Media.
</P>
<P>
   The new company will control a chain of eight weekly newspapers.
The investors, including the money management firm of Weiss, Peck &AMP;
Greer and a private equity fund associated with the Canadian
Imperial Bank of Commerce, paid between $150 million and $160
million for the Voice, The L.A. Weekly and five other newspapers,
according to a source familiar with the finances of Stern
Publishing. Leonard N. Stern bought the Voice in 1985 for $55
million; the other newspapers were acquired later.
</P>
<P>
   Schneiderman would not confirm the price, but in an interview he
confirmed the broad outlines of the deal, which was completed
Tuesday, nearly four months after Stern Publishing put the
newspaper up for sale. In early December, Stern executives narrowed
the group of buyers from six _ only one of which was a media
company _ to one.
</P>
<P>
   The sale was also confirmed by Robert Broadwater, the managing
director of Veronis, Suhler &AMP; Associates, which handled the sale
for Stern Publishing.
</P>
<P>
   The investor group led by Weiss, Peck is the sixth owner of the
institution that defined alternative journalism in the 1950s and
1960s, was an early poster child for media takeover battles in the
1970s, when it was bought by Rupert Murdoch, and took a new course
in the 1990s. In 1996, in anticipation of the new free mass medium,
the World Wide Web, The Voice eliminated its $1.25 cover price in
favor of free distribution.
</P>
<P>
   Now the newspaper that was as anticorporate as any in the
country has become the flagship of a corporation bearing its name:
Village Voice Media. Its goal, Schneiderman said, is threefold.
</P>
<P>
   _ First, to acquire more alternative newspapers, making it the
leading rival of the Phoenix-based New Times alternative chain.
</P>
<P>
   _ Second, to make partnerships with Internet companies in search
of local news and advertising. Regardless of what kind of
journalism the newspapers are producing, ``I want multiple channels
of distribution,'' he said. ``I want the reporter to feel that you
don't have to wait for a publication cycle.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Finally, since two of the new investors own radio stations, he
said, he is contemplating partnership arrangements or the purchase
of stations. ``It works perfectly,'' he said, ``because the
demographics are exactly the same.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview last fall, Broadwater said that the average
reader of the Voice was a single, college-educated 31-year-old man
with an annual income of $40,000.
</P>
<P>
   Schneiderman said Tuesday that the current editor, Donald H.
Forst, would remain ``as long as he wants to,'' and that he
envisioned few changes in the journalism of the Voice, which
reaches 250,000 readers a week. The Voice will continue to be
distributed free.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said that the circulation of the Voice rose from
111,298 to more than 250,000 after it began free distribution in
1996, and increased advertising revenue more than made up for the
$3 million in lost circulation revenue. But its influence was
already waning, as traditional newspapers and magazines along with
new Internet journals appropriated everything from its once-unique
media and cultural coverage to its irreverence.
</P>
<P>
   The other newspapers owned by Village Voice Media are in Long
Island, N.Y., Cleveland, Nashville, Minneapolis, Seattle, and
Orange County, Calif.

HANK GREENBERG: HE BATTED FOR THE TIGERS, HIMSELF AND AMERICAN
JEWS  
(FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 9)

<P>
   In late September 1934, Hank Greenberg, the great Detroit Tigers
slugger, chose not to play a crucial game against the Yankees so
that he could observe Yom Kippur. A hero to Detroit's Jewish
community in only his second season, Greenberg's appearance at
Shaarey Zedek synagogue moved the congregants to burst into
applause as four rabbis prayed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here was this Jewish fella, walking into the synagogue,'' Bert
Gordon, a fan, recalls in ``The Life and Times of Hank Greenberg,''
a new documentary by Aviva Kempner. ``Six feet four! My God, nobody
had never seen a Jew that big. Everybody was 5 foot 5, 5 foot 6!''
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers lost the game, 5-2, yet won the American League
pennant. But Greenberg's decision to honor his heritage galvanized
his bond with Jews. ``The Jewish people,'' Bud Shaver wrote in The
Detroit Times, ``could have no finer representative.''
</P>
<P>
   Aviva Kempner and her brother, Jonathan, knew of Greenberg from
their father, Harold, who left Lithuania for Pittsburgh in 1925 and
settled in Detroit. To Harold Kempner, baseball was a ritual of
American assimilation and Greenberg a symbol. As Sen. Carl Levin,
DMich., puts it in the film, Greenberg ``validated that this was
the land of opportunity: look, we could even play baseball!''
</P>
<P>
   So each year, Harold Kempner reminded his children that
Greenberg sat on Yom Kippur. ``I thought Hank Greenberg was part of
the Kol Nidre lituMs. Kempner, now 53, said in a recent
interview.
</P>
<P>
   Harold Kempner died in 1976 and Greenberg died 10 years later,
one day before Ms. Kempner attended the Los Angeles opening of her
first film, ``The Partisans of Vilna,'' a documentary about Jewish
resistance to the Nazis in that cultured Lithuanian city.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as I heard that Hank had died, I knew he would be my
next film,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   To Ms. Kempner, documenting the life of a Jewish ballplayer is
only a small leap from chronicling Jewish partisans in the ghetto.
``With `Partisans,' I tried to figure out the unanswered question,
`Why didn't Jews resist?' which was totally incorrect,'' she said.
``It should have been, `How could they resist?' It was so
difficult. They were so isolated. With Hank Greenberg, I wanted to
counter the screen stereotype that Jewish men were nebbishes. There
was another image, and for my ethnic background it was Hank.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite acclaim for ``Vilna,'' raising $1 million was not easy
when her subject was a dead ballplayer who did not marry a movie
star, endorse products or make staged stadium appearances, like Joe
DiMaggio. There would be no grants like the $400,000 provided by
the National Endowment for the Humanities for ``Vilna.''
</P>
<P>
   Several times she shut down filming to rustle up money from a a
variety of sources, including regional and local arts groups,
Jewish organizations, individuals like Kirk Douglas and Norman
Lear, the Greenberg family, and the Shaarey Zedek synagogue.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the beginning, we weren't even sure it would be
completed,'' said Alva Greenberg, Hank's daughter. ``We'd see
10-minute segments, but we didn't know what it would add up to
be.''
</P>
<P>
   But after 13 years _ as long as Greenberg's baseball career _
``The Life and Times of Hank Greenberg'' will open on Wednesday at
Film Forum in Manhattan for a two-week run.
</P>
<P>
   Spending so much time on a single project requires tenacity,
even a crush on one's subject. Occasionally, Ms. Kempner said, she
spoke to a life-size hooked rug bearing Greenberg's likeness that
hangs in her house in Washington. ``Many a night,'' she said, ``I'd
just go into the living room and turn the lights low. I'd look at
Hank and say: `I'm going to do it. It's going to get done. And I'd
pray to my dad.''
</P>
<P>
   She paused, then regained her composure. ``It's just how I honor
my father,'' she added. ``If he could see this film, he'd be
`kvelling.'''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Greenberg's greatness is undisputed. In a career interrupted for
most of five seasons by World War II, the lumbering first baseman
hit 331 home runs, compiled a .313 career batting average and
knocked in 1,276 runs. In 1937, his 183 runs batted in were one
fewer than Lou Gehrig's league record. His 58 home runs in 1938
were second to the 60 hit by Babe Ruth in 1927.
</P>
<P>
   ``No question that he was the greatest Jewish hitter of all
time,'' said Steve Greenberg, one of Greenberg's two sons and a
former deputy commissioner of Major League Baseball. ``But that's
not how he wanted to be remembered. If you talk to players of that
era, they knew he was one of the greatest players. Ted Williams
said he was his idol.''
</P>
<P>
   In Ms. Kempner's homey documentary _ a quilt of newsreel
footage, interviews and spirited music selections like Mandy
Patinkin singing ``Take Me Out to the Ballgame'' in Yiddish _
Greenberg is a quiet hero flawed only by his fielding range. To the
worshipful fans who adored him as ``Hankus Pankus,'' Greenberg was
a ``messiah,'' ``a Jewish god,'' a Moses-like savior who refuted
the stereotypes about what Jews could do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had this Captain Marvel, Hank Greenberg, on my shoulder,''
Rabbi Reeve Brenner says in the film. ``He was my big brother, my
mishpocheh'' (family). Alan Dershowitz, the Harvard Law School
professor, adds, ``He was what `they' said we could never be.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Tigers traded Greenberg to the Pittsburgh Pirates in
1947, Don Shapiro, an oral surgeon and fan, felt as if ``your
bubbe'' _ grandmother _ ``moved to Mississippi.''
</P>
<P>
   The passion is poignant, humorous and over the top, like Ms.
Kempner's. Yet those who admired Greenberg know his achievements
came in the face of ethnic baiting by fans and rival players and
the anti-Semitic rantings of the Rev. Charles E. Coughlin, the
so-called radio priest from the Detroit suburb of Royal Oak, and
Henry Ford.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the height of domestic anti-Semitism and the Nazis
overrunning Europe, here was a Jewish player so good, so powerful
and almost breaking Ruth's record,'' Ms. Kempner said. ``Two months
after Hank nearly broke Ruth's record, Kristallnacht happened in
Germany.''
</P>
<P>
   In a 1984 interview used in the film, Greenberg recalled:
``There was always some leather lung yelling at me. I found it was
a spur to make me do better because I could never fall asleep on
the field. As soon as you struck out, you weren't only a bum, you
were a Jewish bum.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenberg served as an unusual Jewish icon. He was raised in an
Orthodox household and had a bar mitzvah, but as an adult he grew
distant from Judaism. ``He took the 10 Commandments as his code of
living,'' Steve Greenberg said. ``You wouldn't find him in the shul
at High Holidays, but he thought about being a mensch.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kempner's film is a reminder of Greenberg's significance at
a particular time, but his life does not resonate as powerfully
today as it did in the 1930s. Jews still constitute a distinct
minority in sports, but their status is rarely an issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hank Greenberg was a tough Jew when tough Jews were
important,'' said Peter Levine, author of ``Ellis Island to Ebbets
Field: Sports and the American Jewish Experience'' ``But if you
wanted tough Jews after 1948, you looked at Israel, where Jews put
their lives on the line. He was a role model for my parents'
generation.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Alva Greenberg, who knew little of her father's impact until
she attended college, said: ``People don't understand what happened
then and what's happening now. We need to understand that the roots
of anti-Semitism go way back. His story is important to tell.''

   CHAPPAQUA, N.Y. _ As the first of two moving trucks turned onto
Old House Lane, the new homeowners were nowhere to be seen. And
rather than bring over a plate of cookies, one neighbor phoned the
police to complain about all the reporters huddled at the end of
his driveway.
</P>
<P>
   This was moving day, first family-style, on a street that has
grown a little weary of the klieg-light publicity surrounding the
anticipated arrival of President Clinton and Hillary Rodham
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But Wednesday should be different. Mrs. Clinton is expected to
arrive in the afternoon to start unpacking the boxes of furniture
and belongings that have been in storage in Washington since she
and President Clinton moved there from Arkansas seven years ago.
``She's excited about moving in,'' said Karen Finney, a spokeswoman
for the first lady. Both and Mrs. Clinton are scheduled to visit
the house toward the end of next week, Ms. Finney said.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons bought the $1.7 million house here on Nov. 1, and
in late November Mrs. Clinton declared her candidacy for the United
States Senate after months of exploring a run for office and
touring New York. She needs to establish residency in New York
State by Election Day to appear on the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton has already registered to vote as a New Yorker, her
advisers said Tuesday. She mailed in a signed registration form to
the Westchester Board of Elections last month, shifting her
official place of voting from Arkansas. As a result, the first lady
will be able to vote in the New York State presidential primary on
March 7. Under state law, Mrs. Clinton needed to register within 25
days of the primary.
</P>
<P>
   The first lady will move to the new house while the president
stays at the White House, although they will rejoin each other on
weekends.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, as two dozen reporters and photographers waited at the
end of the Clintons' cul-de-sac for the United Van Lines trucks to
arrive, Secret Service agents strode purposefully about the
one-acre property. Up and down the lane, at the foot of neighbors'
driveways, were ``no trespassing'' and ``private'' signs perched
next to mailboxes _ an uncommon sight in this congenial hamlet.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the empty Clinton house, a white-shingled Colonial at 15
Old House Lane, were two ``old friends'' of Mrs. Clinton's who were
directing the movers, Ms. Finney said. They were Kaki Hockersmith,
who, conveniently, is an interior designer, and Carolyn Huber, who
also helped the Clintons during their transition from the
governor's mansion in Arkansas to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   And lest anyone wonder whether the Clintons were getting
financial aid from friends for the moving costs, Ms. Finney told
reporters more than once that the couple were paying the bill
themselves. In the fall, the Clintons obtained a 30-year mortgage
after abandoning a much-criticized arrangement with a Democratic
Party fund-raiser, Terry McAuliffe, who had guaranteed an earlier
loan with $1.35 million of his money as collateral.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, at the Grand Union just up Route 117 from Old House
Lane, one resident worried that the police seemed distracted by the
Clintons' move to Chappaqua. ``People are more concerned that the
police cars all seem to be parked at the top of their street rather
than patrolling the town,'' said Renee Kase, a 41-year-old
homemaker with three children. Another resident and a registered
Republican, Patricia Richeson, seemed to put aside partisan
politics upon learning that the Clintons' belongings had made it
here. ``How wonderful,'' she said. ``I'm happy for them. They
haven't had their own home in 18 years. I'd like to give them the
benefit of the doubt.''
</P>
<P>
   On Old House Lane, any excitement has been tempered by the
realization of what it means to have the first lady as a neighbor.
The Secret Service, which will be monitoring the comings and goings
on the street, recently asked Zyrafete Osmani for photographs of
herself, her husband and their five children, and took down
information about the makes and models of their five cars. A loyal
supporter of President Clinton, Mrs. Osmani obliged.
</P>
<P>
   The parking ban is another thing. As a security measure, parking
has been forbidden on Old House Lane, and that upsets Mrs. Osmani.
``We have a big family,'' she said, ``and for holidays they park on
the street.''
</P>
<P>
   Recently, their relatives found parking tickets on the
windshields. Considerate hosts to the end, the Osmanis paid the $12
fines.

A THEATRICAL VISIONARY DESERVES A FULLER PORTRAIT  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 9) 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 By WALTER GOODMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Cradle Will Rock,'' Tim Robbins' hectic try for an epic film
treatment of the brief rise and sudden fall of the Federal Theater
Project, ends on what is meant to be a rousing note: the premiere
of Marc Blitzstein's 1937 opera, which gives the movie its name.
</P>
<P>
   After the work's opening was censored by Washington, ostensibly
as part of cutbacks in financing, the first-night New York audience
of several hundred journeyed 21 blocks uptown along with Orson
Welles and John Houseman, that formidable director-producer team,
from a padlocked theater to a bare one, where Blitzstein, alone at
a beat-up piano, occupied the stage, while cast members, ordered by
Equity not to set foot behind the footlights, rendered their lines
from seats in the orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for the movie, this performance, which has entered
theatrical lore, was also a prime example of the era's
popular-front mentality. Blitzstein's music, influenced by Kurt
Weill, could be compelling, but listening now to the tale of a
stalwart steel-union leader (named, for clarification, Larry
Foreman) standing up against the plutocrats of Steeltown U.S.A.,
especially the rotten `` Mister,'' is to be caught in a time warp.
</P>
<P>
   It is impossible to take the show seriously, as put together in
Robbins' cliche-jammed version, much less share in the rapturous
reception by a pro-union audience at a time when a bitter
union-management battle was being fought out in the steel industry.
</P>
<P>
   Like this prolonged climax, the rest of the movie, which Robbins
wrote as well as directed, suffers from its own class-struggle
theme, as working stiffs and artists without money are set against
millionaire bosses and their fascist consorts. We can take the show
as a sort of period piece, an attempt to capture the
them-against-us spirit of the Depression era.
</P>
<P>
   But with its cartoonlike characterizations (everybody from
Nelson Rockefeller to Diego Rivera to William Randolph Hearst to
Bertolt Brecht), it is a historical offense against the Federal
Theater Project itself, reducing it to what its enemies in Congress
asserted it was, a sort of agitprop factory run by a crowd of
lefties.
</P>
<P>
   Hallie Flanagan (1890-1969), who headed the Federal Theater
Project in its brave and troubled existence, deserves better. The
movie treats her deservedly as a heroine of America's one effort to
create what she envisioned as a free, adult, uncensored theater.
But in trying to reproduce the commotions of the 1930s, Robbins,
captured by nostalgia for the left, diminishes her accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   Hired from Vassar, where she ran the nation's leading
experimental theater, Flanagan (played winningly in the movie by
Cherry Jones) brought to the idea of a federal theater rich
experience, high standards and an indomitable spirit. Not even the
crude assault of congressional subversive hunters could rattle her
professionalism or tarnish her reputation.
</P>
<P>
   Her ability and commitment were tested from all sides. The
Federal Theater Project was just one minor element in the New
Deal's assemblage of relief projects; its mandate was to give jobs
to unemployed actors, stagehands and other theater folk. That meant
that some seasoned professionals were barred because they were
fortunate enough to have savings or part-time employment, and some
of those who got jobs were not of the first caliber.
</P>
<P>
   Along with that basic conflict between helping the jobless and
creating professional productions came uneasy relations with the
established theatrical unions, on the defensive against any threat
to their members' jobs, as well with a new union, the Workers
Alliance, which recruited the down-and-outers and had a reputation
for militancy, even of a Communist stripe. There were run-ins, too,
with theater owners, aspiring censors and protesters of all sorts
in a period when protest was a leisure-time industry.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of administrative headaches, shaky personnel and not
much money, Flanagan managed to come through with a vigorous
campaign to bring live performances to all sections of the country
and to large audiences, many of whom had never seen a stage
production before.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   There was classical theater (``Horse Eats Hat''); newer plays
(``Murder in the Cathedral''); experiments (``The Tragical History
of Dr. Faustus''); children's theater (``Revolt of the Beavers,''
written off by one critic as ``Marx a la Mother Goose''); musicals
(``Sing for Your Supper,'' which gave us both ``Ballad for
Americans'' and the lyrics, ``I don't want to be intellectual/ I
want to be sexual''); black theater (``Swing Mikado''); Yiddish
theater (``Awake and Sing''), and dance, pageants, puppets and all
manner of variations.
</P>
<P>
   An ambitious array, marked by enterprise and energy. Not all
came close to satisfying Flanagan's standards, but the admission
charges were minimal (25 cents to 50 cents), as were the wages ($21
to $55 a month for the untrained, up to $103.40 for New York
professionals), and many productions won raves from both critics
and the public. A few found a memorable place in theater history.
</P>
<P>
   The themes that agitated the Federal Theater Project's enemies,
notably Southern Democrats and conservative Republicans in
Congress, were those on topical issues, particularly under the
rubric of ``Living Newspapers.'' Here were ``Triple-A Plowed
Under,'' about the quashing of the New Deal's farm program (Earl
Browder, then leading the American Communist Party, is quoted
between Al Smith and Thomas Jefferson); ``One-Third of the
Nation,'' on the homeless, and ``Power,'' a paean to the Tennessee
Valley Authority.
</P>
<P>
   It did not escape the Dies Committee, headed by Martin Dies, a
Democrat from Texas, that such plays were not plugs for capitalism.
His committee would become famous as the House Committee on
Un-American Activities.
</P>
<P>
   The congressmen, no great theater fans to begin with,
immediately began a search for the Communists behind this plot to
besmirch the rich and perhaps encourage race-mingling. But although
there were Communists at work (John Howard Lawson, who would be a
sort of commissar of the blacklisted Hollywood Ten, contributed
``Processional,'' about striking miners), their machinations were
not required to explain the leftward tendencies of the '30s,
particularly among people who had been hit hard by the hard times.
</P>
<P>
   After all, by Works Progress Administration rules, the Federal
Theater Project was mandated to be pro-union and no investigation
of clients' ideologies was permitted.
</P>
<P>
   Although Flanagan herself was put off by heavy-handed propaganda
that got in the way of theatrical effectiveness, she did her best
to explain to the congressmen that criticism of the establishment
had always been part of the theater's mission and never more so
than in the contentious atmosphere of the Depression.
</P>
<P>
   They were not listening. By the mid-1930s the New Deal had lost
much of its political punch and in 1939 the federal theater was
finished off by Congress. The cradle fell. For all its artistic
weaknesses and ideological preachments, this WPA project remains
the first and last serious experiment in federally subsidized
theater and a tribute to Hallie Flanagan.

 &HT;    Ohio time capsule opens window on past
 &HT;    By Benjamin Kline

<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Former employees of Rike's Department Store and
community leaders got a peek Tuesday at a 1937 time capsule
discovered in the downtown building prior to its demolition Nov. 7.
</P>
<P>
   Ooohs and aahs of nostalgia arose from a group of 100 people
seated on folding chairs in the Victoria Theatre lobby as Brian
Hackett, director of the Montgomery County Historical Society, put
on white gloves and used a pair of tin snips to cut open the
battered, dirty-gray copper box.
</P>
<P>
   Historical society curator Mary Oliver helped Hackett remove and
hold up the contents. Copies of Dayton newspapers (one proclaiming
a win by the New York Yankees), coins, sales tax stamps, postage
stamps, fashion magazines and Rike's own juvenile magazine were
among the items packed away by store owners Frederick and David
Rike at the time they dedicated an addition to the store.
</P>
<P>
   A treasure for retired employees was a loosely bound book with
signatures and names of important people present at the dedication
and, floor by floor, the store's employees at that time.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Horan, director of Second and Main Ltd., said the time
capsule and its contents are being turned over to the historical
society. Horan said the historical society also will be asked to
help plan the contents of a new time capsule to be deposited in the
new Benjamin and Marian Schuster Performing Arts Center on the
Rike's site.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCHESTER, N.Y. _ Determined to conclude one of the longest and
ugliest chapters in criminal justice history, a federal judge
announced Tuesday that the inmates who were beaten and tortured
during the 1971 Attica prison uprising would receive a settlement
of $8 million from New York state.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement, which provides an additional $4 million for
lawyers' fees, is believed to be the biggest ever in a prisoners'
rights case. But it may also be remembered as one of the longest
and most vexing to hammer out, coming 25 years after a class-action
civil suit was filed on behalf of 1,281 inmates over the storming
of the western New York prison by state troopers. The uprising and
siege left 43 people dead and more than 80 wounded.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's agreement, in U.S. District Court here, still requires
the approval of the inmates who can be located, and the judge,
Michael Telesca, faces the daunting task of apportioning the money
according to each inmate's suffering from the incident.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Even so, everyone involved in the case sounded cautiously
optimistic, saying that the matter could be wrapped up by year's
end. If that happens, the settlement will herald the end of a
tragic episode that left a scar on the country's cultural and
political psyche.
</P>
<P>
   ``The settlement lifts a tremendous emotion for the parties and
for this community. We have all suffered,'' Telesca said at
Tuesday's hearing, before a small crowd of lawyers, former inmates
and reporters. ``The end is in sight.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   About 400 inmates are expected to weigh in on whether the
settlement is a fair one by the court-imposed deadline of
mid-February, said Joe Heath, one of the inmates' lawyers. Another
400 may be dead, he said, while the others may either be
uninterested or unable to locate.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement does not come anywhere near the $2.8 billion the
plaintiffs originally sought in 1974. But for the lawyers, former
inmates and supporters who never abandoned the fight, the issue was
never money: it was holding government accountable for its actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody can feel bad about what happened at Attica, but
there's no amount of money that can compensate,'' said Frank B.B.
Smith, 66, a former inmate who suffered perhaps the worst injuries
from the brutal reprisals that followed the uprising.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who was assaulted, burned and threatened with castration
and death, has since moved to Queens and works as a paralegal,
dedicating himself to prisoners' rights cases.
</P>
<P>
   In the settlement, the state, acting on behalf of several former
state police and correction officials, agreed to set aside $12
million, with about $8 million specifically for prisoners. As is
customary in settlements, the defendants admitted neither liability
nor wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   The defendants were Vincent Mancusi, the former superintendent
of Attica; Karl Pfeil, the former deputy warden; the estate of
Russell Oswald, who was commissioner of the Department of
Correctional Services; and the estate of John Monahan, who was
commander of the state police in Batavia.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``We're exceedingly relieved that it has been settled,'' said
Richard Moot, Mancusi's lawyer. ``He enormously regrets the riot
ever took place, and he regrets the loss of life and injury
involved in the retaking of the prison.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Should the inmates reach a consensus to accept the settlement,
Telesca will hold hearings to divide the money according to factors
like the extent of a plaintiff's injuries, and the extent to which
the injuries affected his future earnings potential. And while the
figures are expected to vary widely, the average, roughly, could be
about $20,000 per inmate _ not a great amount, but nothing to
sneeze at, either, said the inmates' lawyers.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``If they don't accept this settlement, the litigation will
continue, and they won't get their money any time soon, if ever,''
said Elizabeth Fink, the principal lawyer for the inmates, who
began to work on the Attica case two weeks after being admitted to
the bar and has continued ever since. ``It would take decades, and
we'd all be dead, so what compensation is that?''
</P>
<P>
   But decades from now, Attica may well be remembered not for the
legal quagmire that it spawned, but for its role as a watershed
event in American history, as a symbol of brute force.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regardless of where you stood on America _ whether you thought
that prisoners were being mistreated or they were dangerously out
of control _ either way, you felt that something was wrong with the
basic institutions in our country after Attica,'' said Rogers M.
Smith, Alfred Cowles Professor of Government at Yale. ``So it
contributed to a mood of cynicism and despair in our country.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 9, 1971, inmates at the Attica Correctional Facility,
about 30 miles east of Buffalo, took several guards hostage and
seized control of parts of the prison.
</P>
<P>
   They demanded things that today seem routine, said Herman
Badillo, then a congressman from the Bronx who was brought in as a
mediator: basic medical care, better food, the right to read
newspapers published by the Black Panthers, the right to have a
Black Muslim minister.
</P>
<P>
   But after several days of negotiations stalled, Gov. Nelson
Rockefeller ordered the retaking of Prison Yard D. So state
troopers stormed the prison, using helicopters, dropping tear gas
and firing indiscriminately in the crowd of 1,281 inmates.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Then, in the hours that followed the initial offensive, prison
guards and law enforcement authorities committed brutal acts of
reprisals against the inmates, including denying basic medical care
to the injured.
</P>
<P>
   In all, 11 guards and 32 prisoners died during the five-day
siege, in what was then the bloodiest one-day encounter between
Americans since just after the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   The aftermath of the assault was messy and passionate.
Government officials distorted the facts, only to be rebuked by
witnesses and medical evidence. The news media got much of the
story wrong, only to add an armor of skepticism.
</P>
<P>
   There were legal pyrotechnics, too. First, government officials
filed kidnapping and other criminal charges against 62 inmates;
those inmates were later granted clemency by Gov. Hugh Carey.
</P>
<P>
   A small group of inmates who had been injured, and their heirs
of some who had been killed, during the initial offensive won $1.3
million in the state's Court of Claims. The widows of some guards
killed during the uprising sued, too, with mixed success.
</P>
<P>
   The class-action suit, meanwhile, took 18 years before coming to
a liability trial, and an additional 5 to reach the damages phase;
the inmates' lawyers and a federal judge later blamed a lower court
judge and the state of New York for the delays.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Smith won a $4 million jury verdict, and David Brosig,
another inmate who had been in the D Yard, $75,000. But a federal
appeals court overturned that verdict in August, ruling that the
trial judge, John Elfvin, had mishandled the trial. So the case was
placed in the hands of Telesca, who vowed to resolve the matter
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, all parties put on their most cordial faces in praising
the judge and assessing the $12 million settlement, which appears
to be the biggest monetary award for a prisoners' rights case, said
John Boston, project director of the Legal Aid Society's Prisoners'
Rights Project in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there was a bittersweet tinge to the atmosphere. The
plaintiffs are all middle-aged or old men now, from 48 to 80.
Prison conditions today, in the current tough-on-crime climate, may
be no better than in 1971. And for the inmates and their lawyers,
there was a sense of disbelief that a life's work was nearing an
end.
</P>
<P>
   ``As in any compromise, this should not and cannot be viewed as
a clear victory for either side,'' Telesca said Tuesday. ``The
continuing recriminations of who's right and who's wrong _ I will
leave that to history.''

STATES GATHER BIG SURPLUSES, BENEFIT OF A STRONG ECONOMY

<TEXT>
<P>
   Buoyed by revenues from a strong economy, states have
accumulated large surpluses, are cutting taxes and plan to increase
spending for education and health care this year.
</P>
<P>
   In a new report, the National Governors' Association said that
36 states had surpluses equal to 5 percent or more of their
spending.
</P>
<P>
   State surpluses totaled $35 billion at the end of the 1999
fiscal year, and states expect to wind up the current fiscal year
with more than $27 billion in surpluses.
</P>
<P>
   In the last year, 42 states cut taxes. And a separate survey by
the National Conference of State Legislatures says that at least
one-fourth of the states are seriously considering tax cuts this
year. Governors or legislative leaders have proposed such cuts in
Alaska, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Kansas, Maryland, Minnesota,
New York, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Utah and Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   The conference of state legislatures said states had cut taxes
in each of the last five years. William T. Pound, executive
director of the conference, said: ``For the sixth year in a row,
states are expecting to see continued sound fiscal health. This
unprecedented streak is the fiscal equivalent of defying gravity.''
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, Sen. Mark Montigny, a Democrat who is chairman
of the Ways and Means Committee, said, ``We're in about the
strongest financial position we've been in.'' Montigny said the
state had a comfortable cushion in its unemployment fund and its
budget stabilization fund, enough to carry it through a recession,
should one occur.
</P>
<P>
   The last recession ended in March 1991, and President Clinton
often says that the nation will set a record next month for ``the
longest economic expansion in the history of our country.''
</P>
<P>
   In this year's elections, politicians from both parties are
stressing their commitment to tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Thomas Carper of Delaware, a Democrat running for the
Senate seat held for 29 years by William V. Roth Jr., a Republican,
boasts that Delaware has cut personal or business taxes for seven
years in a row.
</P>
<P>
   Stacey Mazer, a fiscal analyst at the National Association of
State Budget Officers, said states were using more of their surplus
money for construction of roads and schools this year. By contrast,
she said, in the last few years, they set aside more of the money
in ``rainy day'' funds, which can be used in time of economic
trouble. But having made provision for a rainy day, states say they
can now use their surpluses for other purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Roy Barnes of Georgia, a Democrat, asked the State
Legislature on Monday to use some of the state's $648 million
surplus to improve education and health care, and he is also
proposing a cut in property taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been blessed with unprecedented prosperitynes
said. ``One way to help keep Georgia prosperous is to let taxpayers
keep more of their hard-earned money.''
</P>
<P>
   The New York State Legislature convenes on Wednesday, and
members say they expect a surplus of $1 billion or more in the
fiscal year that ends March 31. That does not include a surplus of
$1.8 billion that accumulated in the prior fiscal year and is being
used to pay for property tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, as in many states, legislators would like to use
some of the surplus for programs popular with voters. But
independent budget monitors, including bond-rating agencies, have
expressed concern that tax cuts already enacted in New York could
hamper the state's ability to deliver services, particularly if
there is an economic downturn. Gov. George Pataki, a Republican, is
expected to plead with lawmakers to set aside much of the surplus
as a hedge against such a downturn.
</P>
<P>
   In California, the Legislature convened this week, with state
offprojecting a budget surplus of at least $2.6 billion for
the current fiscal year. And they foresee a $3 billion surplus for
the next year.
</P>
<P>
   How to use such surpluses will be a major issue for lawmakers in
California and other states. State legislatures begin their regular
sessions this month in 36 states. Legislators convene in eight more
states in February, March or April.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond Scheppach, executive director of the National Governors'
Association, said that Medicaid costs were surging again, after
several years of slow growth in the health program for low-income
people. Spending on prescription drugs is a major reason for the
increase, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The survey by the governors' association found that states cut
taxes last year by a total of $5.2 billion. Texas reported the
biggest cut, $1.9 billion, followed by Florida ($834 million),
Minnesota ($796 million), Michigan ($497 million), Pennsylvania
($407 million), Ohio ($337 million) and California ($302 million).
</P>
<P>
   Property tax relief and other tax cuts were a major element of
Gov. George W. Bush's legislative program in Texas last year. And
they are a major element of the record on which he is running for
president.
</P>
<P>
   New York reported a tax cut of $99 million, while New Jersey cut
taxes by $101 million and Connecticut cut $104 million.
</P>
<P>
   Illinois reported the biggest net increase in revenues, $436
million, mainly because it increased motor vehicle registration
fees, to help finance public works projects. New Hampshire, Oregon
and Tennessee also increased taxes, the governors' association
said.
</P>
<P>
   The governors said 10 states had taken action to change the
amount of cash payments to families on welfare in the current
fiscal year. Nine states _ California, Maine, Maryland, Michigan,
Montana, Ohio, Tennessee, Texas and West Virginia _ increased
benefits for at least some welfare recipients. Florida was the only
state that reported a reduction in cash assistance benefits, a 15
percent decrease.
</P>
<P>
   In 40 states, the report said, welfare benefit levels remain the
same as in 1999. In general, it said, states are making fundamental
changes in the structure of welfare programs without altering
benefit levels. The number of people on welfare has plummeted, by
51 percent since January 1993, but spending for welfare and child
care has increased. As a result, states say, they now spend more
for each family on welfare, on the average, than they did seven
years ago.

IN TURBULENT TIMES, A PRISON BOILED OVER 
</HEADLINE>
   (Sidebar with NY-ATTICA-SUIT)  
(bl) 
 By CLYDE HABERMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even before the rioting started on Sept. 9, 1971, the state
prison in Attica, N.Y., was in ferment. So was the entire country.
</P>
<P>
   Two months earlier, angry Attica inmates had petitioned state
correction officials to ease chronic overcrowding and censorship
rules, and to improve conditions that limited them to one shower a
week and one roll of toilet paper a month. A sign of the brewing
unrest was a fast that the prisoners held on Aug. 22 in memory of
George Jackson, a prominent black radical who had been killed by
prison guards in California during a breakout attempt.
</P>
<P>
   Emotions finally boiled over on the morning of Sept. 9. As they
made their way to breakfast, a group of Attica inmates surged
through a prison gallery. What would turn out to be the worst
prison rebellion in U.S. history _ the bloodiest one-day clash
between Americans in a century _ was on.
</P>
<P>
   Inmates stormed down a passageway and broke through a central
area known as Times Square, giving them access to all cellblocks.
In this initial rioting, some severely beat a guard, William Quinn,
who died two days later.
</P>
<P>
   Later that day, the authorities retook most of the prison. But
the rebels controlled an exercise field called D Yard. There, 1,281
convicts assembled, with 39 prison guards and other employees held
as hostages.
</P>
<P>
   The next three days brought negotiations between inmates and
state officials that were alternately tense and bizarre. Perhaps
nothing was more unusual than the presence of ``outside''
negotiators and observers brought in at the prisoners' insistence,
a group that included Rep. Herman Badillo of the Bronx, civil
rights lawyer William Kunstler and New York Times columnist Tom
Wicker.
</P>
<P>
   But the negotiations went nowhere. The inmates' demands
escalated way beyond prison conditions, to include the removal of
the Attica superintendent and total amnesty for everyone in D Yard.
Some of the observers, hoping to defuse the situation, begged Gov.
Nelson Rockefeller to come to the scene, but he refused.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he ordered that the prison be retaken, and on Sept. 13
state troopers and several Attica guards stormed D Yard, firing
about 3,000 rounds through a haze of tear gas. A disenchanted state
prosecutor would later call it ``a turkey shoot.''
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes, the troopers killed 10 hostages and 29 inmates,
and seriously wounded 89 others. The bodies of three convicts,
killed by fellow inmates over the four days, were later found.
Including Quinn, the death toll was 43.
</P>
<P>
   After regaining control, state officials announced that rebels
had killed hostages by slitting their throats. One man was said to
have been castrated. But autopsies proved the allegation to be
untrue. All the deaths on Sept. 13 were caused by trooper gunfire.
</P>
<P>
   That lie by officialdom contributed greatly to Attica's bitter
legacy _ that and brutal reprisals against inmates, which led to
lawsuits and, finally, Tuesday's court settlement in Rochester.
</P>

IOWA TURNS ITS PRESIDENTIAL CAUCUSES INTO A CASH COW, AND MILKS
FURIOUSLY
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By LESLIE WAYNE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa _ Iowa Republicans knew they were onto
something big in 1998 when the presidential candidate Steve Forbes
said he could get his good friend, former Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher of Britain, to come to Iowa and help raise money for local
statehouse candidates.
</P>
<P>
   So, accepting Forbes' offer, the party hung British flags on a
downtown hotel, invented an honor for Mrs. Thatcher _ the Freedom
Without Borders medal _ and made her the featured attraction at a
$250-a-ticket luncheon that raised $500,000 for Iowa Republicans
during the mid-term elections.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the power of presidential politics in Iowa, where local
politicians and civic boosters have figured out how to turn their
first-in-the-nation caucus status into a money-raising device and a
tool for economic development. Only in Iowa have presidential
candidates, congressional leaders and world figures, like Mrs.
Thatcher, been crisscrossing the state to help local politicians
with personal appearances and, in some cases, direct donations.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone, it seems, is climbing on the political bandwagon here,
from Iowa economic development officials who see the January
caucuses as a way to burnish the state's image, to hotels and
restaurants whose reservations swell during the caucus season, to
Iowa legislative candidates who have the pick of presidential
hopefuls to campaign on their behalf.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is entrepreneurial politics at its best,'' said Steve
Grubbs, former chairman of the Republican Party of Iowa. ``Where
else can the state party call up a legislative candidate and say
`we're bringing a presidential candidate to fund raise for you' and
have the candidate get picky about which one?''
</P>
<P>
   A September dinner appearance by Gov. George W. Bush of Texas
raised $100,000 for Iowa Republicans, the same amount Elizabeth
Dole raised a few months earlier. A joint Al Gore-Bill Bradley
appearance in October netted state Democrats $500,000. The biggest
money-raiser is the Ames Straw Poll, a Republican event wite
real political meaning that brought the state party over $1 million
last August, most from the pockets of Republican presidential
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest beneficiaries of the Iowa caucuses have been the
state political parties,'' sh Winebrenner, a political
science professor at Drake University here. ``They have events with
presidential candidates and raise lots of money. It's allowed them
to have excellent headquarters, big bureaucracies and throw lots of
money into legislative races.''
</P>
<P>
   Ron Corbett, former speaker of the Iowa House, added,
``Legislators in other states are jealous of us.''
</P>
<P>
   The key to this money machine is the Jan. 24 caucuses, where
Republicans and Democrats come to precinct meetings and cast votes
for the 2000 presidential race in a ballot that is not binding on
Iowa's delegates to the national conventions. The largely symbolic
event slowly took on real meaning after the state's Democratic
Party in 1972 pushed the caucus date up to January, making it the
first event of the primary season.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1976 race, Jimmy Carter used the caucuses as a
springboard to the Democratic nomination _ much to the astonishment
of the national media. Since then, all presidential candidates have
had to pass through Iowa on their road to the White House. In their
wake are journalists from all over the world _ by last count, over
650 came for last August's Ames straw poll, and more are expected
for this month's caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Between Denver and Chicago, the candidates would just drop
leaflets on us as they flew over, if it were not for the
caucuses,'' said Kayne Robinson, chairman of the Iowa Republican
Party. ``The caucuses allow us to get celebrity candidates out here
and allows the rest of the nation to see them in the raw. In the
process, everyone spends a heck of a lot of money here.''
</P>
<P>
   Money is spent in many ways. For starters, in the two years
before the caucuses, potential presidential candidates and
congressional leaders come here to gain publicity for themselves
and for their party. In doing so, they become the celebrity draw at
local fund-raisers, buy tickets to political events and host lavish
receptions for the party faithful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Local party activists will call you and say they want the
national party or a national campaign to send someone to Iowa to
appear at a local event,'' said the campaign manager for one
presidential candidate. ``Then, the local guys say they need you to
buy tickets to the event. Then they charge you a registration fee.
And you have to hold a reception for them. You provide all the food
and the entertainment. In fact, you are the entertainment.''
</P>
<P>
   Iowa politicians say there is nothing like a political star to
draw a crowd and separate people from their money.
</P>
<P>
   ``People will come to an event to support the legislative races
when you've got a candidate there like Bush,'' said Robinson of the
Iowa Republican Party. ``And Bush's people will also buy tickets to
the event. Without the celebrity, it's just an event and maybe all
you would raise would be $10,000. A celebrity will get you over
$50,000.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican officials estimate that presidential candidates have
attended at least 50 Iowa fund-raisers for local candidates in this
election cycle and have appeared in around 40 of the state's 99
counties. They have attended events ranging from small coffee
klatches to a ``Candidate Cavalcade'' at the party's Cedar Rapids
convention, where presidential candidates, after having bought
tickets, paid for receptions and picked up their own travel
expenses, got 10 minutes to speak before being gonged off the stage
by a loud buzzer.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In addition, presidential candidates write checks directly to
statehouse candidates. The state Republican Party and the
presidential hopefuls _ with the exception of Bush _ gave $2.1
million to Iowa legislative candidates in the 1998 mid-term
elections, while Democratic legislative candidates received
$615,772 from their party. By comparison, state-level Republican
candidates in Missouri received $1 million from their party over
the same period and Democrats, $540,902. In Minnesota, the
Republican Party gave its state candidates $401,998 and Democrats
gave $324,135.
</P>
<P>
   ``I visited with all the presidential candidates,'' said Lynn
Schulte, a defeated Republican statehouse candidate who got
contributions from $875 to $1,500 from Dan Quayle, Lamar Alexander
and Steve Forbes. ``They are trying to build good will.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Mike Sexton, a Republican who won his state Senate bid:
``Last fall, you could get any of the presidential candidates to
come around and, if they liked you, write a check. Iowans are
spoiled.''
</P>
<P>
   No fund-raising opportunity is too small. At a recent Republican
training session, Robinson, the party chairman, was passing around
a ``County Caucus Buck Bag,'' which volunteers will use to raise
money for the county party on caucus night. He showed how to get
caucus-goers to whip out a $5 bill and put it in the bag. ``Make it
fun,'' said Robinson, ``The point is, you pass the hat and the
county party gets to keep it.''
</P>
<P>
   Iowa Republicans and Democrats differ, however, in their
tactics. Rob Tully, the Democratic chairman, is far less aggressive
in approaching presidential candidates for help.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't drain the presidential campaigns of cash for the
benefit of the state party'' said Tully. ``Dumping money into the
state party is not in the best interest of the presidential
candidates.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Democrats are not shy in tapping into presidential
celebrity. The annual Jefferson-Jackson dinner in October was the
largest in Iowa history, with 3,000 attending the $300-a-plate
event, with its joint Al Gore-Bill Bradley appearance. ``We ran out
of tables and tablecloths in Iowa and had to got to Omaha to get
more chairs shipped in,'' said Tully.
</P>
<P>
   Even that pales against the straw poll, in which Republicans are
bused to Ames for a day. That event raised more than $1 million for
the state party, which put a price tag on items ranging from space
in the parking lot (the Bush campaign paid $40,000 to put its tent
in the best location) to a spot on the scoreboard ($5,000) of the
Iowa State Center, where the poll was held.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, anyone voting in the straw poll had to buy a $25
ticket _ which, of course, the presidential candidates bought for
their supporters. Steve Forbes, who came in second in the straw
poll, paid $290,553 for his appearance there: $158,275 to buy
tickets for his supporters, $50,000 to rent space and the remainder
for food, music, a sound and light system, balloons and decorating.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the state Republican Party has built a powerful
computer data base _ names, phone numbers and addresses of their
voters and donors and sells it to all presidential candidates,
starting at $10,000. ``The big boys will pay for this and they are
glad to get it,'' said Robinson, the party's chairman.
</P>
<P>
   State economic development officials welcome the media frenzy.
``This is our chance to showcase Iowa as something more than cows
and pigs,'' said Mike Blouin, chief executive of the Des Moines
Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Local officials work hard to make life easier for the hundreds
of journalists who come here _ providing foreign journalists with
translators, laying fiber optic connections and satellite uplinks
for television transmission and having a Web site chock full of
information on political history and such practical matters as
where to get clothes cleaned.
</P>
<P>
   And the economic development officials _ who say they have made
no studies of the economic impact of this activity _ are,
nonetheless, taking a page from this political playbook. The Des
Moines chamber says tickets to its annual fund-raising dinner are
flying out the door, even at $125 each.
</P>
<P>
   The reason? Just a week before the Iowa caucuses, the Chamber
has lined up a former president as its keynote speaker _ George
Bush.

BELICHICK'S THE NAME OF THE GAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I don't know anything for sure, except this entire charade is
being orchestrated to bring Bill Belichick to New England as the
next head coach of the Patriots. I don't know anything, but my
instincts tell me that before this week is out, there will be some
kind of settlement, most likely put together by NFL commissioner
Paul Tagliabue, that gets Belichick out of New York and into New
England.
</P>
<P>
   Tagliabue was the peacemaker three years ago, when Bill Parcells
left the Patriots to go to the New York Jets. The Patriots said he
couldn't do that because he had a contract with them as head coach.
Tagliabue ruled in their favor, and worked out compensation _ four
draft choices _ for New England to release Parcells.
</P>
<P>
   When Belichick stunned everyone, including Parcells, by quitting
the Jets Tuesday, he created the same situation. He's under
contract to the Jets as head coach but wants to get to New England.
The question now is, how much does New England want to give up to
get him?
</P>
<P>
   After the league office informed Belichick through his agent
that it considers his contract with the Jets binding, he asked for
an expedited hearing with Tagliabue, and one will come within 48
hours.
</P>
<P>
   For two days, Neil Conrich, the agent, has been going back and
forth behind the scenes with the legal types at NFL headquarters in
New York trying to get Belichick to New England. He can do that
only by getting the league, or a judge, to rule that Belichick does
not have a contract to be ``head coach'' of the Jets, but only a
contract to be ``defensive coordinator.''
</P>
<P>
   The NFL has told Conrich more than once that its legal
department has examined the contract, and in its opinion, Belichick
has a contract to be head coach of the New York Jets for the next
three years. Conrich disagrees. Late Tuesday, the league office
informed all teams in the league that none were to talk to
Belichick or his agent in the interim.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Jets president Steve Gutman said emphatically Tuesday
that, under terms written in clear, ``unambiguous'' language,
Belichick automatically became head coach Sunday night, when Bill
Parcells resigned. Gutman said Belichick has signed five
(contractual) documents with the Jets in just three years, the most
recent in 1999, and all of them contain language about him
succeeding Parcells immediately as head coach.
</P>
<P>
   This situation has stunned Parcells. Belichick had scheduled a
2:30 p.m. press conference Tuesday to meet for the first time with
the media as head coach of the Jets. On the way up the hall, he
stopped by Parcells's office to tell him he was going to quit,
``not more than 60 seconds before'' the press conference was going
to start.
</P>
<P>
   In a rambling press conferece, Belichick tried to leave the
impression that he wanted out because of the uncertainty that might
come about with new ownership. The sale of the Jets is expected to
be completed within 10 days. However, the new owner _ whether it is
Charles Dolan or Woody Johnson, the two remaining suitors _ must
assume all contracts currently held by the organization.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the new ownership wanted to get rid of Belichick, it
would have to pay him off in full for the remaining three years of
his contract, which would come to close to $5 million.
</P>
<P>
   When Belichick left New England for New York, he signed a
contract that made him defensive coordinator and assistant head
coach as long as Parcells stayed, and head coach as soon as
Parcells stepped aside.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, he has been the highest-paid assistant coach in the
history of the game. A year ago, he was offered a chance to
interview for the Kansas City and Chicago head coaching jobs. The
late Leon Hess, former owner of the Jets, gave Belichick a $1
million bonus for bypassing the opportunity to go somewhere else as
head coach, and to wait for the Jets job. According to sources,
Conrich is now trying to tell NFL lawyers that the bonus was for
doing a great job as defensive coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots asked permission Monday to talk to Belichick about
being their head coach and general manager. The Jets denied
permission, saying he was under contract as head coach. The league
office agreed with the Jets.
</P>
<P>
   Belichick is taking a major risk here. If the league office
again rules that his contract with the Jets is as a head coach, he
cannot take another coaching job in the league unless the Jets let
him go. The Jets will not let him go unless there is compensation _
especially from New England, which put the squeeze on for draft
choices three years ago when the situation was reversed.
</P>
<P>
   Belichick reportedly made $750,000 as coordinator and would make
$1.5 million as head coach. With New England, the offer most likely
was going to be worth more than $2 million per year.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets say the title of ``general manager'' in New England is
irrelevant. Belichick has been told by Parcells that he, Belichick,
would have all the power of a general manager and that Parcells
would not be involved in any of those decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Coincidentally, it was another Parcells episode, way back in
1986 after he coached the Giants to their first Super Bowl, that
triggered a ruling by then-commissioner Pete Rozelle that a team
didn't have to let its coach go simply to let him be a coach and
general manager somewhere else. Atlanta wanted to get Parcells away
from the Giants with such a move. Rozelle rejected it, saying that
Parcells could go to Atlanta as general manager but could not be
the head coach, and Atlanta lost interest.
</P>
<P>
   That set the precedent for this case, where Conrich has gone two
ways: (1) Belichick's contract is as an assistant coach, and (2)
being made general manager is a step up from coaching with the
Jets, and he should be allowed to do it.
</P>
<P>
   Now, if the Patriots are willing to give up a Lawrence Welk
draft choice package _ a one, and a two, and a three _ then
everything, as Welk used to say, might be ``wunnerful, wunnerful.''

JAMES ENSOR: AN EXPRESSIONIST BEFORE THERE WAS EXPRESSIONISM  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 9) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ALAN RIDING   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ By the time James Ensor celebrated his 30th
birthday, in 1890, he was already an exceptional painter. Equally
comfortable with portraits, still lifes, domestic interiors and
seascapes, he had learned what he wanted from his French
Impressionist contemporaries and was now going his own way.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, when he died in 1949, aged 89, he was a relatively marginal
figure, regarded as something of an eccentric by his fellow
Belgians and known abroad principally for the sinister masked
figures and skeletons that peopled many of his paintings, drawings
and etchings.
</P>
<P>
   Ensor himself often expressed bitterness at his lack of wider
recognition, but in a sense it was of his own making. Born in
Ostend to a Belgian mother and a British father, he attended the
Academie Royale des Beaux Arts in Brussels between 1877 and 1880,
then promptly returned to his windswept hometown beside the North
Sea.
</P>
<P>
   Except for occasional outings to Brussels, two visits to Paris
and one to London, he spent the rest of his life there. So, at the
height of his powers, he was cut off from Europe's
late-19th-century art storm. And after that he lost much of his
originality.
</P>
<P>
   His personality did not help. He announced early on that he was
``a revolutionary,'' which was fine when it came to rebelling
against the academic teaching of his art college in Brussels. But
he soon dismissed the Impressionists and even fell out with the
Groupe des XX, an avant-garde collective, of which he was a
co-founder. By all accounts haughty, paranoid, self-obsessed
(including a peculiar identification with Christ) and very much a
loner (he never married), he took on religion, politicians, judges,
other artists and, above all, the very petit bourgeoisie to which
he belonged. So Ensor was not exactly bent on making friends.
</P>
<P>
   But talented he was, above all in his early years, as quickly
becomes apparent in a major retrospective of his work, organized by
the Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium and on display at the
Museum of Ancient Art in Brussels through Feb. 13. Indeed, the
show, the biggest since 1929, comprising 369 works including 190
oils, seems designed to use the 50th anniversary of Ensor's death
to give him the status he was denied in his lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   Past neglect, though, has created one gaping hole in the show:
only 12 years ago, Ensor's most famous painting, ``Christ's Entry
Into Brussels in 1889,'' was acquired by the Getty Trust from a
private Belgian foundation _ and Belgium's government allowed it to
leave. It now hangs in pride of place in the Getty Museum, in Los
Angeles, and was considered too fragile to travel here.
</P>
<P>
   Ensor's own experience with the oil was no less discouraging.
Measuring 169{ inches wide by 99{ inches high, it was his largest
work, and he prepared carefully for it with a series of drawings
(some of which are in this show). In the painting, a tiny,
almost-hidden figure of Christ, who bears an uncanny resemblance to
the painter, is seen entering Brussels through a mob of pre-Lenten
carnival revelers, many wearing grotesque masks and costumes.
</P>
<P>
   The aggressive color and heavy use of palette knife and both
ends of the paint brush suggest why Ensor is considered a precursor
of 20th-century Expressionism. Yet the Groupe des XX refused to
exhibit the painting in 1889, and it was another 40 years before it
was shown in public.
</P>
<P>
   When Ensor painted ``Christ's Entry,'' he had nonetheless
traveled far in a short time. As a student in Brussels and then
when he set up a studio in the attic of his parents' home in
Ostend, he seemed to fear nothing, and tried his hand at all genres
of painting. He sought inspiration in Rubens and Rembrandt for his
portraiture, with ``Self-Portrait With Flowered Hat,'' painted in
1883 and reworked in 1888, a direct homage to Rubens. ``The
Lamplighter'' (1880) and ``The Dark Lady'' (1881) suggest the
influence of Manet, while a number of drawings of so-called Ostend
``types'' confirm that he had already mastered draftsmanship.
</P>
<P>
   Around the same time, he did an impressive series of still
lifes, echoing the obsession of the 17th-century Netherlandish
still life masters with reflection and texture, but working far
more freely with his brush. His domestic interiors, notably
``Bourgeois Salon'' (1881), are themselves almost like still lifes,
despite the presence of his mother, aunt or sister, his most
frequent models.
</P>
<P>
   At this stage, as illustrated by his remarkable ``Woman Eating
Oysters'' (1882), Impressionism was clearly still a novelty to him,
with even his beach scenes and seascapes characterized by muted
colors and diffused light.
</P>
<P>
   Masks make their first appearance in 1883, in a painting called
``Scandalized Masks,'' which shows a masked old woman waving a
stick at a masked man drinking in a bar. Ensor's use of masks was
not of itself surprising. His maternal grandparents and his aunt
owned curio shops that sold, as Ensor later wrote, ``seashells,
lace, stuffed rare fish, old books, prints, weapons and Chinese
porcelain.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Around carnival time, they also sold the papier-mache masks that
remain a feature of Ostend's Mardi Gras. Ensor's interest, however,
was in using masks as vehicles for social commentary.
</P>
<P>
   With ``Scandalized Masks,'' the commentary was hardly subtle:
his father, an alcoholic, would drink himself to death within four
years. But this oil also marked the beginning of Ensor's switch
from realism to symbolism. And within a short time, he had broken
free of all Impressionist influence in his use of pure colors,
direct light and bold brush strokes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Fall of Rebel Angels'' (1889), a swirling mass of colors,
expressionist before the term was coined, shows how far and how
quickly he moved. Similarly, ``Christ Calming the Storm'' (1891),
while it has echoes of Turner, whose work Ensor saw in London in
1887, verges on the abstract.
</P>
<P>
   Although the self-portrait ``Ensor Surrounded by Masks'' (1899),
showed he could still paint in a traditional manner, his work
assumed a grotesque, almost comic-book quality, evocative of two
other Flemish masters, Bruegel and Bosch. ``The Baths at Ostend''
(1890), for instance, ridiculed the summer crowds that would invade
his hometown. ``Skeletons Fighting Over a Pickled Herring'' (1891)
and ``The Dangerous Cooks'' (1896) are both macabre attacks on his
critics in the art world.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Good Judges'' (1891) and ``The Bad Doctors'' (1892) are in
turn satires on what the artist viewed as self-important
professions. ``At the Conservatory'' (1902), which portrays a
choir, includes an amusing sketch of Wagner with his fingers in his
ears. Ensor could also poke fun at himself, as in the self-portrait
``The Skeleton Painter'' (1896).
</P>
<P>
   Significantly, though, three-quarters of the paintings in this
show were done between 1876 and 1900, a clear indication of how
Ensor's creative drive weakened as he approached middle age. His
strong attachment to his mother and his aunt perhaps explain the
emotional p the paintings he did of each on her deathbed,
his mother in 1915, his aunt in 1916. But his copies of pre-1900
works compare poorly with the originals, while his view of the
world was gradually reduced to masks and skeletons, as with
``Comical Skeletons'' (1920), which shows the artist Willem Paerels
offering a skull smoking a cigar to Ensor's long-time mistress,
Augusta Boogaerts, and ``The visectors'' (1925), his furious
attack on vivisection.
</P>
<P>
   Strangely, since he could not read music, he seems to have
become increasingly distracted from painting by music. In 1906,
Ensor was given a harmonium by friends and, helped by a good ear,
he would play extracts from operettas or popular waltzes and songs.
Musician friends would also write down melodies that he composed,
finally pulling them together into a ballet called ``La Gamme
d'Amour,'' for which Ensor designed the sets and costumes. The
ballet was first performed in Ostend in 1920.
</P>
<P>
   As he moved into old age, Ensor began to win some recognition,
at least in Belgium. The first retrospective of his work was held
in Brussels in 1920; he was elected to Belgium's Royal Academy in
1924, and an even larger retrospective was organized in the Palais
des Beaux-Arts in Brussels in 1929, at which time he was made a
hereditary baron and could at last display ``Christ's Entry Into
Brussels in 1889.'' But in Paris, where the art world was consumed
by a succession of -isms _ post-Impressionism, Cubism, Surrealism _
Ensor was largely ignored.
</P>
<P>
   The current show ends appropriately with three self-portraits
painted in 1939 that summarize his life: ``Me and My Circle'' has
him surrounded by masks; ``Ensor the Musician and His Keys of G''
shows him accompanied by angels with trumpets; and ``Me, My Color
and My Attributes'' portrays him with palette and paint brushes,
with two angels hovering protectively over his head. And perhaps
that is how he wanted to be remembered.
</P>
<P>
   But, as this show clearly demonstrates, it is the younger Ensor,
the ``thin artistic Don Quixote,'' as one friend described him, who
is in fact worth remembering.

HENRY FOWLER, 91, FORMER TREASURY SECRETARY  
(HLW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va., N.J., N.Y.)   By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Henry H. Fowler, who as Treasury secretary in the Johnson
administration helped raise the money to meet the soaring costs of
the Vietnam War and who proposed what turned out to be the last
federal budget surplus in a generation, died on Monday at a nursing
home in Alexandria, Va. He was 91.
</P>
<P>
   A cherubic and courtly Virginian, Fowler, commonly called by his
nickname, Joe, alternated a distinguished private law career with
numerous influential government posts over four decades.
</P>
<P>
   He presided over fiscal policy at a time of major expansion of
the Vietnam War, eventually lobbying vigorously in 1968 for a 10
percent tax increase that many analysts said should have been
imposed sooner. President Lyndon Johnson's long insistence that the
nation could afford both guns and butter is widely thought to have
been a catalyst, along with the rise of OPEC, for much of the
inflation that subsequently bedeviled the country.
</P>
<P>
   His unwavering support of Johnson, who contended that a tax
increase could not be won in Congress, accounted for Fowler's delay
in publicly favoring the higher taxes for which he is said to have
pressed within the administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a great loyalist,'' said Paul Volcker, then a Treasury
official and later chairman of the Federal Reserve. ``He wasn't
going to get out of step with Johnson.''
</P>
<P>
   With the surcharge and spending cuts, the 1969 budget, which
Fowler helped assemble, turned out to be the last one without a
deficit until 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In early 1968, the financially strapped administration became so
alarmed about the country's trade imbalance that Fowler proposed a
detailed plan to Congress to curb foreign travel by imposing a tax
on spending outside the Western Hemisphere at rates of 15 percent
or 30 percent, exempting only the first $7 a day. The levy was
never adopted.
</P>
<P>
   But with the dollar under attack and the nation's gold reserves
dwindling, Fowler put forward a drastic plan to create a new
reserve currency, later called special drawing rights, managed by
the International Monetary Fund. SDR's, sometimes called paper
gold, still exist, though their importance has waned since
currencies were unhooked from the pegged syopted toward the
end of War World II that linked the major world currencies to the
dollar and the dollar, in turn, to gold.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was always proudest of his being creator of the SDR's,''
said Roy C. Smith, a son-in-law, who teaches at New York
University's Stern School of Business.
</P>
<P>
   Another legacy was co-founding a precursor to what has become
the annual economic summit meeting attended by top officials of the
biggest Western countries plus Japan and, more recently, Russia.
Fowler's 1967 suggestion for a ``seminar'' of five finance
ministers to harmonize policies was promptly taken up by James
Callaghan, then Britain's chancellor of the Exchequer.
</P>
<P>
   Fowler's tenure as Treasury secretary also saw the replacement
of America's largely silver coinage with the cupronickel
``sandwiches'' that still prevail. This action was forced when the
market price of silver climbed enough to make it profitable to melt
coins down.
</P>
<P>
   Fowler resigned a month before Richard Nixon's inauguration as
president in 1969 to give his deputy, Joseph Barr, a chance to
serve briefly as Treasury secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Roanoke, Va., the son of a railroad engineer, Fowler
graduated from Roanoke College, earned law degrees at Yale
University and in the years leading up to America's entry into
World War II took a job as an apprentice with the noted Washington
law firm of Covington &AMP; Burling. In 1934, he joined the legal staff
of the Tennessee Valley Authority, where he helped in a long and
ultimately successful defense of a constitutional challenge to the
agency's electric power program. He met his future wife, Trudye
Hathcote, from Amory, Miss., who was also working at TVA
headquarters in Knoxville, Tenn. They married in 1938.
</P>
<P>
   Fowler served later as special counsel to the Federal Power
Commission, negotiating arrangements with Canada and New York state
for the St. Lawrence Seaway project.
</P>
<P>
   During World War II, Fowler was assistant general counsel for
the War Production Board and economic adviser to the American
economic mission in London, which helped coordinate production and
supply activities of the United States, Britain and Canada before
and after the D-Day invasion.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the war, Fowler founded the Washington law firm of
Fowler, Leva, Hawes &AMP; Symington, composed initially of former War
Production Board colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   His 14-year stint there was interrupted when he took a leave
during the Korean War to head the Defense Production Administration
and to serve as a member of the National Security Council and of
President Truman's cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   In 1961, he became undersecretary of the Treasury, then the
department's No. 2 post, before briefly rejoining his law firm in
1964 only to leave again when Johnson named him Treasury secretary
in 1965 to succeed C. Douglas Dillon. Fowler is said to have been
recommended by his longtime friend Sidney Weinberg, senior partner
at the Wall Street investment company Goldman Sachs and an adviser
to presidents since the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   Though he lacked banking credentials, Fowler held generally
conservative views acceptable to the business community and was
regarded as an effective politician, notably in helping to win
congressional passage of tax-cut legislation in 1962 and 1964 as
well as the 1968 increase.
</P>
<P>
   A staunch Democrat long active in the politics of his home
state, Fowler turned aside suggestions that he run for governor of
Virginia against candidates supported by the state machine of Sen.
Harry F. Byrd, whom he strongly opposed. He was a delegate and
alternate, respectively, to the Democratic National Conventions of
1956 and 1960.
</P>
<P>
   At the state's 1956 Democratic convention, 9 of the 10
congressional districts had supported a move to withdraw the
state's support from the party's national ticket, headed by Adlai
Stevenson, when delegates from Fowler's 10th District in northern
Virginia cast their lone dissenting vote. This brought shouts of
``Yankee go home'' from supporters.
</P>
<P>
   After Fowler left Washington in 1969, Weinberg recruited him to
a partnership at Goldman Sachs, where he worked mainly to expand
the firm's international operations and its dealings in government
securities. He headed Goldman Sachs International Corp. until 1984
and remained a limited partner until Goldman went public in May
1999.
</P>
<P>
   Fowler is survived by his wife; two daughters, Marianne Fowler
Smith, of Montclair, N.J., and Susan Fowler-Gallagher, of
Staatsburg, N.Y.; four grandchildren; and three
great-grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   How Fowler got his nickname, Joe, which he used to sign letters
but declined to explain, is uncertain. According to one version, it
was conferred on him as a teenager by a Greek-immigrant restaurant
owner in his hometown who had difficulty pronouncing other American
names. But Smith, his son-in-law, says it came about because Fowler
was called ``Gentleman Joe'' or ``Joe College'' by Yale classmates.

PARCELLS VS. KRAFT A FEUD FOR THE AGES 
</HEADLINE>
   For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The week is young, and already the NFL has had more firings and
resignations than the Nixon White House.
</P>
<P>
   This much is certain: The Bill Parcells-Bob Kraft feud is taking
on Biblical proportion as it steamrolls into a new century. It's
more vicious and spiteful than Jimmy Hoffa vs. Bobby Kennedy,
Thurman Munson vs. Carlton Fisk, or Ken Starr vs. Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Francis Ford Coppola gave us Godfather I, II, and III.
Parcells-Kraft is forever. Oliver Stone already has bought the
rights to produce and direct his next NFL flick, ``Any Given
Contract.'' NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue probably would rather
go rafting with Al Davis and Jerry Jones than revisit this
Parcells-Kraft unholy war.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Belichick, the longtime Parcells sidecar man who was
anointed head coach of the Jets when Parcells resigned Monday,
stunned the sports world Tuesday by resigning from the position.
Conspiracy theorists see it as the latest thinly-veiled
counterpunch in the Parcells-Kraft feud.
</P>
<P>
   Question: Is Bill Belichick really this good a head coach? It
was one thing to watch the Patriots and Jets wrestle over the Big
Tuna. But Belichick isn't Parcells. We know only that he's a
brilliant defensive coordinator, had a checkered career as head
coach of the Cleveland Browns, and has been the focus of two of the
strangest press conferences in sports history.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, knowing it was a charade, Belichick trotted out
his wife for the bogus announcement that he was going to be head
coach of the Jets with a little help from ``consultant'' Parcells.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, in a performance that made Rick Pitino sound like Abe
Lincoln, Belichick told the world he was resigning from the Jets
and said, ``It's not about trying to get out of a contract or into
a contract.'' He cited the ``uncertainties in the organization,''
as reasons for quitting. He did not mention the $1 million bonus he
took from the late Leon Hess last year _ money that the Jets claim
was a reward for staying with the organization.
</P>
<P>
   This time he used Mrs. Belichick to explain how the family will
survive in the wake of his resignation. Sounding like Richard Nixon
in the infamous Checkers Speech _ remember frugal Pat in the
ordinary Republican cloth coat? _ the coach said his wife has been
clipping coupons.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Belichick has learned more than football from Parcells.
The Tuna was equally disingenuous three years ago when he said he
was going to be a ``consultant.'' Now we have Belichick, invoking
the third person more than Wade Boggs on the Barbara Walters show,
insulting everyone's intelligence by claiming his resignation has
nothing to do with another opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   At times sounding almost as goofy as Pete Carroll (remember him?
He used to coach the Patriots), Belichick now can claim to have
served two terms as Jets head coach without ever coaching an actual
game. It's like when the Red Sox ``signed'' Sammy Sosa, John
Wetteland, and Kevin Appier. Al Haig's stint in the Oval Office was
longer than Belichick's two terms as head coach of the Jets.
</P>
<P>
   Belichick's rambling session in Hempstead brings into question
his long relationship with Parcells. He has followed the Tuna
around the country and there were few hints of a rift between the
two, but Tuesday he sounded as though he's sick of working with a
star coach who constantly reserves the right to change his mind.
</P>
<P>
   It's America. Belichick should coach where he wants to coach,
just as Parcells did every time he left a job. But this time the
Jets claim they have the ironclad contract, and so far the NFL
agrees. Bob Kraft and pocket-rocket son Jonathan (who was floating
Belichick-to-New England rumors before the Patriots played in the
playoffs last year), may have some tough decisions to make.
</P>
<P>
   The rift is fascinating. Parcells-Kraft is the
Russell-Chamberlain steel cage match of the new century.
</P>
<P>
   How will Tagliabue rule this time? Will Kraft part with draft
picks just to bring Belichick to New England? How many Jet players
would follow Belichick to the Patriots? And would Parcells come out
of retirement, just to stick it to Kraft one more time?
</P>
<P>
   It's only Wednesday. The week is young.

A CHAMPION OF THE SONG RECITAL WINS IT A FEW MORE VERSES  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 9) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ky., Vt.)  (af) 
 By ANTHONY TOMMASINI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Marilyn Horne has been worried about the song recital
for some time. As an art form, it has been languishing, she says,
which is why seven years ago she set up a foundation to correct
that.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Horne speaks of the problem with considerable authority.
Besides being one of the greatest operatic mezzo-sopranos in
history, she has been a devoted recitalist. She lost count of the
total number of recitals she had given when the tally topped 1,300
a few years back; in the early years of her career she performed
recitals ``in places you cannot imagine,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in 1959 she did a tour of northwestern Canada and
Alaska, singing 19 recitals and some 30 children's concerts in five
weeks. The pace sorely tested her dedication and stamina, not to
mention her adroitness of step.
</P>
<P>
   To reach one engagement, in Kitimat, British Columbia, she had
to travel in a single-engine plane during a storm. The deluge of
rain washed out the only bridge to the next concert site on the
tour. So her guides placed a huge log across a raging river, over
which Ms. Horne and her accompanist and teacher, Gwendolyn
Koldofsky, nervously inched their way to a waiting car. She
recently presented a recital in Laramie, Wyo., in part so she could
complete a goal of singing in all 50 states.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, some commentators contest Ms. Horne's view that the
song recital has long been troubled. In New York, song enthusiasts
enjoy a rich array of recitals, and the audiences are among the
most appreciative and informed.
</P>
<P>
   ``That may be true in New York,'' Ms. Horne said in a recent
interview in her apartment near Lincoln Center. ``I'm talking about
the rest of the country. I've been out there and I know places
where the great singers used to come through regularly to perform
at civic centers and in community concerts. These series largely do
not exist any more.''
</P>
<P>
   The composer Ned Rorem, an elegant and prolific composer of art
songs, is even more alarmed. ``There is not one singer in the world
today who can earn a living primarily as a song recitalist,'' he
said. ``That is, unless they have a reputation in opera. But in
that case their recitals usually contain lots of arias, which is
not the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Horne essentially agrees that there is a difference between
the diva recital, in which a few songs, usually familiar, serve as
filler between the big arias that the opera buffs have really come
to hear, and the song recital as practiced by artists like Jan De
Gaetani and Elly Ameling, who did make their living mostly from
recital work.
</P>
<P>
   For these singers, the glory of art songs, both old and new, is
in the literate and subtle way words and music are mixed. The true
song recital is as much an engrossing evening of poetry as it is a
vocal performance. Ms. Horne especially loves the intimacy of the
art form. ``With opera I sing out to and over the audience,'' she
said. ``With song recitals, I bring the audience in to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Horne said she ``wanted to do something to give back to
music.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to start a competition,'' she said. ``I wanted
to support young singers in giving recitals. They learn the song
repertory in schools. They all want to sing it; they are prepared.
The question is finding places that want them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Marilyn Horne Foundation, which began in 1993, is devoted to
this aim. Its work has been celebrated every year since with a gala
concert on Jan. 16, Ms. Horne's birthday. Next Sunday will be Ms.
Horne's 66th birthday, and the foundation's gala afternoon concert
at Carnegie Hall, billed as ``a millennial musical gift to the city
of New York,'' is free.
</P>
<P>
   Some 600 tickets are being directed to students in schools in
New York City and Newark. (Tickets may be be requested through the
foundation's office at 212-582-2000). In conjunction with the gala,
there are master classes and a panel discussion on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Some renowned singers are to be contributing their artistry to
Sunday's gala, including Renee Fleming, David Daniels, Byrn Terfel,
Deborah Voigt, Dolora Zajick and Jerry Hadley. Some younger singers
who have benefited from the foundation's support and have now come
into their own are also to perform, among them the soprano Isabel
Bayrakdarian, the baritone Lester Lynch and the countertenor Bejun
Mehta.
</P>
<P>
   The program will include the world premieres of songs by William
Bolcom, Richard Hundley and Adam Guettel. Ms. Horne will perform,
which will be especially meaningful, for she is ending her career.
She ceased singing opera four years ago. This season she will leave
the recital stage as well.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation is not run like a competition. The signers, who
tend to be either college age or in the early stages of their
professional careers, are selected by artistic advisers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We encourage all the people on the board, all the teachers and
singers we know to tell us when they hear someone promising,'' Ms.
Horne said. ``Then we audition them. I don't put anyone on I
haven't heard. We have our ears to the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Once a singer is selected, the foundation provides sponsoring
grants to the presenting organizations around the country that have
agreed to participate. Barbara Hocher, the managing director of the
foundation, said that only presenters who have an existing series
of some kind and who have outreach programs to the surrounding
community are eligible.
</P>
<P>
   ``We give them a grant, usually from $5,000 to $10,000,
depending on the venue and the artist's career level, that covers
the fees and expenses of the artists,'' Ms. Hocher said. ``There is
usually some funding left over that they can apply to the education
programs and marketing.'' If the foundation had to present recitals
``from scratch,'' Ms. Horne added, ``it would be too much for us.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The foundation's current endowment is $650,000, much of which
came from corporate and private foundation support, along with more
than 400 individual donors.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the season, the Marilyn Horne Foundation will have
presented 81 singers in recital. Each performs a solo program in
the intimate concert room of the Kosciuszko Foundation in
Manhattan. The artists also appear across the United States in
venues large and small, from the John F. Kennedy Center for the
Performing Arts in Washington to the Grace Note Music Series in
Tyler, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Horne's foundation is not the first to concern itself with
the art of the song. The tenor Pauy is the director of Joy
in Singing, an organization founded in 1958 that auditions young
signers who compete for the prize of a New York recital at Merkin
Concert Hall, preceded by three out-of-town tryouts. The soprano
Chloe Owen, teacher and longtime exponent of American art songs, is
the president of a program at Musicorps, based in Lexington, Ky.
``We are specifically supporting American arts songs for American
composers and singers,'' she said. ``We exclude non-Americans.
There aren't enough chances for Americans here in our own
country.''
</P>
<P>
   There are other such organizations. But Ms. Horne's benefits
enormously from her prominence and the large network of colleagues
she has nurtured during a formidable career. What further sets her
foundation apart is the importance given to outreach projects.
</P>
<P>
   Every selected recitalist is expected to visit and perform at
schools in the vicinity of the presenting institution. In 1995, for
example, the soprano Heidi Grant Murphy gave three programs for
youngsters in the schools of Fairfax, Va., before her formal
recital at George Mason University Institute of the Fine Arts. In
May the tenor Gregory Turay sang for and worked with five groups of
students before his recital at the Palm Springs Desert Museum in
California.
</P>
<P>
   Getting the students from the outreach events into the recital
halls for the evening programs has been more difficult, said Paul
Nelson, professor of political science and director of the concert
series at Middlebury College in Vermont, which has worked with the
Horne Foundation for several years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The song recital is a tough sell,'' he said. ``I think the art
form got in trouble because it seemed to a lot of people a very
formal and almost postured sort of performing. A picture had grown
in people's minds of large singers warbling away on a stage in
languages the audience didn't understand, and if they did see the
texts, the English translations were ponderous and slightly
funny.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, the young singers who have come to the Middlebury
campus though the Horne Foundation, like the baritone Russell Braun
and the mezzo-sopranos Margaret Lattimore and Mary Phillips, have
worked successfully in schools and presented engaging song recitals
that have been well-attended. ``The programs have included sets of
contemporary songs in English, appealing and accessible stuff,''
Nelson said. ``Russell Braun sang some wonderful Noel Coward songs.
None of the music being performed is pop. But it's also not Hugo
Wolf end to end.''
</P>
<P>
   That's just the kind of steady progress in winning audiences to
song recitals that Ms. Horne was hoping to foster when she founded
her foundation. As the gala approaches, she is emotionally ready to
leave the concert stage, she said, though she made one caveat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I may now and then sing a little lighter music somewhere,''
she said. ``But nothing classical. I'm trying to arrange it so that
I don't have to work more than six months a year.'' These days she
cherishes the time she spends witirst grandchild, the
daughter of her daughter, who lives in California.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, during the interview Ms. Horne was as quick to show off
the latest batch of baby pictures as she was to praise like a proud
den mother the young singers she has helped.
</P>
<P>
   The gala weekend, as always, includes master classes and panels.
There will be three events on Friday at the Juilliard Theater. The
pianist Martin Katz, a song recital accompanist, is to give a
master class at 11 a.m.; the soprano Regine Crespin is to give one
at 3 p.m. At 8 p.m. there will be a critics round table discussion
with Richard Dyer of The Boston Globe); Peter G. Davis of New York
magazine; Manuela Hoelterhoff, formerly of The Wall Street Journal;
John von Rhein, The Chicago Tribune, and Heidi Waleson of The Wall
Street Journal. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No doubt the current prognosis for the song recital and Ms.
Horne's effort to resuscitate it will be prime topics.

TURNING CIRCLES AND SQUARES INTO NOISE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 9) 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 Adam Shatz's most recent article for Arts &AMP; Leisure was about the
musicians John Zorn and Arto Lindsay.  
 
 By ADAM SHATZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The 20th century was, in musical terms, a noisy one. I don't
mean loud or even discordant, the customary complaints of audiences
encountering new music, whether Igor Stravinsky's ``Rite of
Spring,'' John Coltrane's ``Ascension'' or Jimi Hendrix's Woodstock
rendition of the national anthem.
</P>
<P>
   I'm referring, rather, to the way that 20th-century composers
have embraced sounds _ environmental, industrial, often random _
and thereby laid siege to inherited notions of musical order. If
last centurnt-garde taught us anything, it is that such
disturbances can be the stuff of art.
</P>
<P>
   The first person to make this point was not a musician but a
painter, Luigi Russolo. A leading member of the Italian Futurist
movement, Russolo drafted a lyrical manifesto in 1913 calling for
the ``renewal of music by means of the Art of Noises'' and scored
works for ``noise intoners,'' primitive machines he built to
replicate the ambient sounds of the modern metropolis.
</P>
<P>
   While no noise intoners have survived, Russolo's project was
extended and enriched by Edgard Varese, Iannis Xenakis, Karlheinz
Stockhausen and John Cage, who from the 1940s until his death in
1992 did more than anyone to make raw sounds a part of our musical
vocabulary.
</P>
<P>
   The art of noise can be heard on two vivid recent double albums:
Sonic Youth's ``Goodbye 20th Century,'' a set of works by Cage and
heirs like Christian Wolff and Cornelius Cardew; and ``Treatise,''
a recording of Cardew's 1967 composition by an ad hoc group of
Chicago free-jazz musicians. Several of the composers are, like
Russolo, artists: Yoko Ono and George Maciunas are best known for
their association with the Fluxus school of conceptual art, while
Cardew worked as a graphic designer.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, their music eschews traditional notation in
favor of abstract drawings, games and verbal instructions. Ms.
Ono's 1961 ``Piece for Soprano'' asks a singer to ``Scream. 1.
Against the wind. 2. Against the wall. 3. Against the sky.'' The
193-page score of Cardew's ``Treatise'' includes not a single note
among its black-ink drawings of squares, triangles and circles.
</P>
<P>
   Outrageous? Sure, but then conventions are intended to make
those who violate them look ridiculous. On closer inspection this
music seems prescient of our own age, in which electronica,
turntable manipulation, sampling and free jazz have dissolved the
borders between noise and music, composition and improvisation,
amateurs and professionals. Yesterday's revolutionary hopes have
become the premises of today's experimental popular music.
</P>
<P>
   Cage's ideas began to spread from the classical scene to a more
vernacular milieu in the late 1960s. Although he had an ardent
following among avant-garde composers (Morton Feldman, Christian
Wolff and Earle Brown), choreographers (Merce Cunningham) and
artists (Robert Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns), the doors to the
classical concert hall had all but closed, and many of his one-time
classical admirers, notably Pierre Boulez, were abandoning Cagean
indeterminacy as a dead end.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Cage's celebration of collective decision making, his
desire to let ``sounds be themselves,'' his embrace of chance and
discontinuity, began to enchant rock musicians who were just
discovering the creative possibilities inherent in studio
production.
</P>
<P>
   As the Brazilian singer Caetano Veloso recently pointed out in
an interview with The Wire, you can hear Cagean echoes in the
Beatle's ``Revolution No. 9.'' You can also detect them in the
Constructivist jazz of Anthony Braxton and Roscoe Mitchell, in Tom
Ze's ``aesthetics of plagiarism,'' in the ``post-rock'' of Tortoise
and Stereolab and in the game pieces of John Zorn as well as in
music by DJs who've never heard Cage's name.
</P>
<P>
   His ghost hovers kindly over ``Goodbye 20th Century'' (SYR 4),
Sonic Youth's homage to 10 of its favorite postwar avant-gardists.
With roots in the guitar minimalism of Glenn Branca as well as
punk, the band has always found in noise an almost religious sense
of exaltation. On ``Goodbye 20th Century,'' the band is joined by
its producer, Wharton Tiers; Jim O'Rourke, a ubiquitous producer
and guitarist in experimental pop; the Cage percussionist William
Winant; the turntable artist Christian Marclay, and the composers
Christian Wolff and Takehisa Kosugi.
</P>
<P>
   The 13 tracks range in length from Ms. Ono's 12-second scream to
Cage's 30-minute ``Four to the Sixth,'' in which an excerpt from a
Black Sabbath guitar solo, prepared piano, drums, marimbas and tape
loops of humming by Sonic Youth's bass guitarist, Kim Gordon,
intersect, overlap and part ways again and again, as if they were
serenely oblivious of one another.
</P>
<P>
   Though the band's signature guitar sound conjures up a familiar
aura of industrial ruin, no attempt has been made to render the
mu less unruly than it is. We are presented here not with
seamless works, but with what the film critic Manny Farber called
``termite art.''
</P>
<P>
   Such art, Farber wrote, ``goes always forward eating its own
boundaries, and, likely as not, leaves nothing in its path other
than signs of eager, industrious, unkempt activity.'' That's a
shrewd characterization of what goes on in Wolff's weirdly hypnotic
``Burdocks.'' This 13-minute meditation on a melodic fragment has
no beginning, middle or end, and yet it moves.
</P>
<P>
   Other works are less successful, in part because such music
often depends on live performance to be understood. Much of the
music created by Cage and his heirs is ``metamusical'': it
possesses a strongly theatrical streak, and the resulting sound is
less important than how it is executed.
</P>
<P>
   The directions for Steve Reich's 1968 ``Pendulum Music,'' for
instance, instruct a group of performers to swing microphones
suspended above loudspeakers until they emit feedback. Although
this might be provocative in concert, it is merely irritating on
record.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pendulum Music,'' in subordinating the performers' will to an
impersonal process, highlights a curious paradox of Cage-influenced
music. By renouncing control of the final product _ by refusing to
``bring order out of chaos,'' as he put it _ the composer
encouraged an unusually participatory approach to performance.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Yet his acceptance of chaos and his blithe rejection of human
intentions also exposed a disregard for individual expression, for
the self-assertion that is virtually synonymous with freedom in
Western music, from the violin concerto to the jazz solo.
</P>
<P>
   This clash of tendencies characterized the short, turbulent
career of the British composer Cornelius Cardew, whose ``Treatise''
has now been recorded in its entirety for the first time. An
instructor at the Royal Academy of Music and a member of AMM, a
seminal electro-acoustic improvising ensemble, Cardew was the
British avant-garde's charismatic leader in the 1960s. After
studying with Stockhausen in the late 1950s, he rejected
traditional notation' and became a champion of Cage's methods.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to break down the barrier between skilled and unskilled
musicians, in 1969 Cardew established the Scratch Orchestra, whose
activities ranged from ``playing conventional instruments'' to
``making motions with a hand or arranging a scarf.'' Some of
England's most important musicians of the 1970s and '80s, including
Brian Eno, Michael Nyman and John Tilbury, were graduates of the
orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Cage, for whom sound experiment was an end in itself,
Cardew was a passionate activist who regarded music as a means to
radical social change. After converting to Maoism in the early
1970s, Cardew assailed his mentor in a screed called ``Stockhausen
Serves Imperialism'' and turned violently against Cage's methods.
The very principles he had upheld, graphic notation and chance, he
now disdained as counterrevolutionary deceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Consistent if nothing else, he repudiated his earlier work,
squandering his considerable artistry on simple agit-prop pieces
for ``the workers,'' notably with ``A Thousand Nails in the Coffin
of Imperialism.'' The workers failed to notice, and he grew
increasingly despondent. After trying his hand at Marxist pop
songs, he was killed by a hit-and-run driver in 1981 at the age of
45.
</P>
<P>
   Although Cardew's Maoist phase proved ruinous to his art, the
Cagean works from the 1960s are long overdue for revival. In
``Treatise,'' Cardew drew upon his knowledge of graphic design as
well as composition. Cardew was hardly alone in suggesting
affinities between music and visual art; Morton Feldman used to
hang his scores on the wall as if they were paintings. Yet Cardew
broke new ground in writing a piece entirely in nonmusical symbols.
</P>
<P>
   ``Treatise'' engages performers in an interpretative game,
challenging them to translate its images into musical sounds. In an
essay on the ``disadvantages of a musication,'' Cardew wrote
that ``Treatise'' would be played, ideally, by children, musical
innocents.
</P>
<P>
   The musicians on the new recording of ``Treatise'' (Hat(Now)Art
2-122) are hardly innocents. They are O'Rourke, who contributes
eerie synthesizer ripples; the cellist Fred Lonberg-Holm; the
clarinetist Guillermo Gregorio; the pianist Jim Baker and the
vibraphonist Carrie Biolo. But they are some of Chicago's most
exploratory improvisers, and they have undertaken Cardew's project
with sympathy and a suitably doctrinaire sense of purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Out of nearly 200 pages of drawings, they have fashioned two and
a half hours of creepy, almost unremittingly somber music. As
conducted by Art Lange, the work is quiet, severe and nearly
stationary in the manner of Feldman's music. And though it's odd to
speak of fidelity to a noteless score, the recording certainly
honors the spirit in which the work was composed. We are dealing,
after all, with a treatise, and who ever heard of a treatise being
fun?
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, ``Treatise'' cannot help betraying its
composer's intentions by the very fact that it is a recording.
``What we hear on tape or disc is indeed the same playing but
divorced from its natural context,'' lamented Cardew, for whom the
``natural context'' _ the act of making and sharing music in a room
and of smashing hierarchy _ was everything.
</P>
<P>
   It might please him to know that ``Treatise'' continues to
elicit interest among musicians. But I think he would be more
excited by the fact that ``musical innocents'' around the world, in
clubs and behind turntables and in the streets, are composing
treatises of their own.

   IRVING, Texas _ He is faster than a Jeff George bullet, can leap
cornerbacks in a single bound, is more powerful than a double team.
</P>
<P>
   Look, it's a bird; it's a plane. No, it's Randy Moss.
</P>
<P>
   In his first two seasons, Moss has played like Superman, with
144 receptions for 2,571 yards and 27 touchdowns. In comparison,
Jerry Rice, the greatest receiver in NFL history, had 135
receptions for 2,497 yards and 18 touchdowns in his first two
seasons with the San Francisco 49ers.
</P>
<P>
   The Dallas Cowboys better pack kryptonite for the trip to
Minnesota and their wild-card playoff date with the Vikings on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Moss is probably by far the best receiver in the league,''
Cowboys strong safety Darren Woodson said. ``We've got our work cut
out for us. We're going to have a challenge, and we have to step up
to the plate.''
</P>
<P>
   This past Sunday, Moss, fresh off a 155-yard receiving day
against the Detroit Lions, spun around in his locker to find
himself surrounded by media. It is the best coverage Moss has
received all year.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if anybody could single-cover him, Moss thought only for a
second. ``Can anybody?'' Moss said. ``I don't know. I think, if the
quarterback is on point, it would be hard to defend me.''
</P>
<P>
   Deion Sanders, arguably the best cover cornerback in NFL
history, will match up with Moss on some plays Sunday. That is why
this game already is being billed as: Moss vs. Sanders II.
</P>
<P>
   The two met on the field for the first time in the Vikings'
27-17 victory in November. They don't see eye to eye on what
happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a pretty good scheme. You've got to give our defense
some credit,'' Sanders said. ``We played a good game last time,
barring a few foolish mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   But Moss and Cris Carter caught 15 passes for 207 yards and
three touchdowns, and, if you listen to Moss, embarrassed the
Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of hype is going to be on myself and Deion,''
said Moss, who caught 75 passes for 1,258 yards and 10 touchdowns
in the regular season. ``I think we got the best of their secondary
the last \Rtime\S we played them.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanders was on the sideline last season when Moss caught three
passes for 163 yards and three touchdowns in the Vikings' 46-36
victory against the Cowboys. But that was last season, when the
Vikings were having their way with the rest of the NFL on their way
to scoring a record 556 points.
</P>
<P>
   While their offensive numbers have dropped (399 points and an
average of 249.3 passing yards this season), the Vikings still are
dangerous. Besides Moss, Carter caught 87 passes for 1,189 yards
and 13 touchdowns and Jake Reed had 44 catches for 643 yards and
two touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having Randy Moss and Cris Carter is enough, but when you add
Jake Reed and some of the other guys they've got, they're pretty
deadly,'' Cowboys free safety George Teague said. ``What you really
don't want to do is give up the big play. At the same time, you'd
hate to just sit there and rot.'' nn

   NEW YORK _ David Hirson's nervy, wildly distinctive first play,
``La Bete,'' opened at the Eugene O'Neill Theater on Feb. 10, 1991,
and very shortly became one of the most famous flops in Broadway
history.
</P>
<P>
   Set in 17th-century France, it is a comedy about the arrival, in
a theater troupe, of a hugely egomaniacal but intellectually
lightweight actor, ``the beast'' or fool of the title, who makes
his entrance with an uninterrupted 22-minute monologue, a paean to
his own gifts.
</P>
<P>
   The theme of the play is the time-honored conflict between
audience-palliating and audience-challenging art. And as if to
underscore the point, it is written _ with a-hard-to-fathom
audacity _ entirely in heroic couplets. Audience reaction was
polarized to the degree that the cliche is applicable: you either
loved it or you hated it. That the playwright was then just 32
years old only enhanced the conflicting views that his gifts were
either prodigious or prodigal.
</P>
<P>
   Its defenders included Jerome Robbins, Katharine Hepburn, Liv
Ullmann, Jules Feiffer, Harold Prince, Kevin Kline and Joanne
Woodward. They were among the 28 signers of a letter written to The
New York Times, beseeching theatergoers to experience what they
called ``an amazing evening in the theater'' and, by implication,
to ignore the two Times critics, Frank Rich and David Richards, who
had found the play wanting, largely because, their reviews said, it
failed to deliver on its promise and ambition.
</P>
<P>
   The Times never published the letter because it arrived too
late; ``La Bete'' closed after 24 performances and 15 previews,
marking it in Broadway lore as a cause celebre casualty of critical
perception and theater economics. At the time, it was the most
expensive nonmusical play ever staged on Broadway, and its
investors lost every cent of the $2 million it cost to put it on.
</P>
<P>
   Such is Hirson's calling card as his second play, ``Wrong
Mountain,'' prepares to open on Thursday, at the very same theater,
with the same director, Richard Jones, and with many of the same
demands on the audience to see, in the lives of artists,
reflections of their own existential problems.
</P>
<P>
   This time Hirson's play has a contemporary setting, and it is
written in nonrhyming prose, the story of Henry Dennett, 60, an
embittered, unappreciated poet who, infuriated by the presumption
of his ex-wife's new boyfriend, a popular playwright named Guy
Halperin, makes a bet that he can write a play and have it
produced.
</P>
<P>
   But lest anyone think that Hirson has lost his moxie, he has
layered the play with gaudy symbols that have been seized on by
Jones: like the enormous intestinal worm that afflicts Henry, a
literal representation of his dyspepsia; and a fountain of
malodorous mineral water from which Henry drinks liberally and
which may or may not be the source of his temperamental
transformation. He asks big questions: for example, is it possible
to devote a life to passions misspent, climbing, as it were, the
wrong mountain?
</P>
<P>
   And in the lapel-grabbing equivalent of a 22-minute monologue,
Hirson has given Henry, played by Ron Rifkin, a vulgarity-laced
first-act speech that is likely to challenge the sympathies of any
theatergoer, particularly anyone prone to equate the sentiments of
a protagonist with those of the author.
</P>
<P>
   Screaming relentlessly at Guy (Michael Winters) over Christmas
dinner, Henry rails against Broadway theater as ``sanctimonious
kitsch that's embraced as high art by an audience of suburban
morons dim-witted enough to believe that by going to a play they're
having some sort of `cultural experience.'''
</P>
<P>
   It is indeed tempting _ unfair, perhaps, but tempting _ to
wonder if Henry is, in fact, speaking the frustrations of a
playwright with Hirson's history. But Hirson, now 41, a man of
seemingly mild temperament who looks a bit like the actor Hugh
Grant and has a similar stammering charm, doesn't seem terribly
frustrated.
</P>
<P>
   Compared to the way he was in 1991, when he declined to be
interviewed by The New York Times because he was too nervous, he
seemed rather at ease, if perhaps a bit fearful of being
misunderstood.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would disappoint me if the play were viewed simply as some
kind of referendum on the experience of `La Bete,''' he said, over
a late-afternoon bowl of soup in a coffee shop near the O'Neill
Theater. He added that the support of so many people within the
theater community, and subsequently successful productions of the
play in London and in American regional theaters provided more
validation of his work than he had any right to hope for in the
first place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consider what my experience with `La Bete' really was,'' he
said. ``I was a first-time playwright. It was a play that was set
in 1654 and written in rhyming couplets. No reasonable person
should ever have expected it would find a commercial producer, and
it was taken up and done on Broadway. My experience was, frankly,
one of gratitude. Certainly I felt people were entitled to love it
or hate it. And they did. In fact, they loved and hated it to such
extremes that I began to appreciate how unusual an experience it
was, not only for a first-time playwright, but any playwright.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Wrong Mountain,'' Hirson is no more Henry Dennett, he said,
than he is Maurice Montesor, the flamboyantly enthusiastic theater
director (played by Daniel Davis) who runs the workshop where
Henry's play is developed; or Clifford Pike (Daniel Jenkins), an
idealistic young writer who also has a play at the workshop; or
even Guy Halperin. Their give and take with Henry on issues
pertaining to the value of art _ Is it supposed to entertain,
challenge, console? Is it a worthwhile pursuit in any case? _
provide the intellectual meat of the play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I'm not Henry Dennett, but he must be in me
somewhere,'' Hirson said. ``I don't think there's a character I've
written in any _ I can't say any of my plays, I've only written two
_ but I don't think there's a character I've written that isn't in
me somewhere. And I don't think I'd create these characters if all
these issues weren't warring inside my head. With Henry, I asked
myself, `What if I were 60 years old and the world had relentlessly
beaten me down, so the plays I wrote never got a hearing? Couldn't
I begin to look at the world as a horribly irredeemable place?
Could I be someone like that?'''
</P>
<P>
   Did Hirson feel that in the audience-baiting speech he is biting
the hand that feeds him? ``Only if you lose sight of the fact that
it is a character in a play who is saying these things,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rifkin, on the other hand, said yes. ``It's a great speech, that
speech,'' the actor said. ``It's such a pretentious attitude on
Henry's part, on my part, but there's some truth to it. On the
first night of previews in New York someone in the audience
screamed out `Wow!' It was pleasing to me that people realized I
was attacking them. I don't know if it works. I want it to work. I
think David is really an amazing fellow.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Wrong Mountain'' opens at a time when new dramas aren't
exactly thriving on Broadway. In fact, at the moment there aren't
any, and a comedy of ideas, with no big stars, by a playwright
without a track record doesn't seem a likely candidate to turn the
tide.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Still, whether or not audiences and critics embrace Hirson's
intellectual gymnastics (reviews in San Francisco, where the play
had a brief run at the American Conservatory Theater in October and
November, were mixed), ``Wrong Mountain,'' as did ``La Bete,''
clearly speaks to _ and for _ his theater colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kind of reception `La Bete' got was wounding, chilling,''
Rifkin said. ``It silences voices that shouldn't be silenced. David
is a hero to me. He really is speaking about the future of art.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael David of Dodger Theatricals, the play's lead producer,
said the actors are all working for reduced salaries to lessen the
risk of the investors who are spending $1.5 million to put the show
on. The producers are working ``for nothing, or next to nothing,''
he added. The Dodgers, known for producing musicals, haven't put on
a nonmusical play since they presented ``Hamlet'' with Ralph
Fiennes in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one thinks we're going to make a lot of money,'' David
said. Then why, he was asked, take the risk on Broadway? Why not
bring the play to smaller, less costly Off Broadway, where many
dramas are currently thriving?
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're passionate about what he's saying, you look for the
biggest megaphone you can,'' David said.
</P>
<P>
   Hirson's background, like that of his plays, is one in which a
love of theater lives in a larger context. He was born into a New
York show business family. His father, Roger O. Hirson, wrote,
among other things, the book for the musical ``Pippin''; his
mother, Alice Hirson, is a television and film actress. After they
separated he split his time between his mother's home in
Westchester County and his father's apartment on the Upper East
Side of Manhattan, not far from the studio in which he now lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to theater a lot as a kid, and I still have within me
the love of theater that any kid does,'' he said. ``You don't do
this with your life if that passion isn't there. But what I
responded to was not the sense of illusion; it was the way the
theater smelled when the curtain went up, the way people looked
onstage, the way they were lit; it was the unreality of it, the bit
of perfumed unreality that attracted me, not the suspension of
disbelief. Maybe that's because I had parents who were in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hirson went to Rye Country Day School, where he performed in
plays, and then to Yale, where _ reacting against his upbringing,
he said _ he didn't. Instead, he began reading widely _ ``I sampled
the full world of liberal arts'' _ and came under the sway of the
first teachers who took notice of his writing. After Yale, he went
to Oxford, studying literature for a time with the Joyce scholar
Richard Ellmann.
</P>
<P>
   In an interesting bit of foreshadowing, for amusement, he wrote
rhyming verse portraits of his fellow students, entering them in a
suggestion book in a common study room. There, they were noted by
another student, the novelist Alan Hollinghurst, who also happened
to be an editor for The Times Literary Supplement. He assigned
Hirson to write a drama review.
</P>
<P>
   When it was published, Hirson said, ``I looked at it on the page
with all the other people's work, and it seemed to blend in, not
leaping out as the worst thing ever in the TLS, and I think that
was the moment for me, as a writer. It just gave me a sense of,
`Maybe it's not completely ill-founded of me to think this is
something I might do in my life in a serious way.'''
</P>
<P>
   From that point on, he said, he understood he was a writer.
``All through this period I'd been filling notebooks with bits of
plays, poems, ideas for short stories,'' he recalled. ``And I think
what I realized, by the time I was in my mid-20s, was that I had
been, for a long time, becoming a writer, and all that stuff about
being an actor was something else. If you'd asked me, at the time,
`Are you a writer?' I'd have said absolutely not.''
</P>
<P>
   The palpable result of this epiphany was ``La Bete,'' begun when
he was 29 and written over a year and a half in his mother's house
in Los Angeles, from the seed of an idea a dozen years old; at 17,
he had gone with his father to a production of ``Tartuffe'' at
Circle in the Square in New York: ``I thought it was the greatest
thing I'd ever seen, and at halftime I turned to my father and
said, `Does anyone write new plays in English rhyming couplets?' My
father said, `Not any more they don't.' And I remember thinking,
`Why not?' The whole sense of word joy was so thrilling to me that
I suddenly thought, `Are writers foolish? Why aren't they doing
this?' And that absolutely lodged in my consciousness. So years
later, when I thought, you know, I've been running from my real
passion for years, which is to have something to do with the
theater, I said to my parents, `Listen, I've had this idea for
years ...' That play was written first line to last. I set up a
table in my mother's house, and I remember closing the door,
thinking, `I don't know how long this is going to take.'''
</P>
<P>
   It is this passionate pursuit of a life that one believes in
that is the subject of ``Wrong Mountain.'' Hirson spent two and a
half years writing it and hopes that audiences will not find it a
play about the theater, but about something larger, a query into
the meaning of any life. Will critics and audiences want to hear
this? That's the other hope.

COMMENTARY: CONTRACT WITH HYPOCRISY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MAUREEN DOWD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Seems like only yesterday that Newt Gingrich was
going to take over the world. He was going to run the McGoverniks
out of town. He was going to restore ``a society that is emphatic
about right and wrong.'' He vowed to be the Definer, the Advocate
and the Arouser of Civilization.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the crash of his political career and second marriage,
Gingrich has been reduced to defining, advocating and arousing as a
pundit on Fox TV.
</P>
<P>
   The former speaker of the House is persona non grata at a
celebration on Capitol Hill on Wednesday marking the fifth
anniversary of the Republican triumph with the Gingrich
Revolution's Contract With America. The Republicans' new motto is
``Freedom Works!''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, what a five years it has been.
</P>
<P>
   Talk about the law of unintended consequences. Crybaby Newt
lamenting his treatment aboard Air Force One and threatening to
shut down the government. When the government did get shut down,
Bill Clinton got a fateful pizza delivery from an intern named
Monica Lewinsky. That led to the Republicans' overreaching to try
to oust the president. That led to the whole Republican
leadership's collapsing, amid confessions of their own affairs.
Early on, Newt also got caught in an ethics flap eerily similar to
the one he had engineered to bring down Speaker Jim Wright, a
Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Republicans know they are a mess. They know they
need a bold stroke to hang on to their House and Senate majorities.
So now they are announcing an updated version of the document that
brought them so high and so low. Here it is, the moment you've been
panting for: Contract With America 2000.
</P>
<P>
   1. &UR; The Personal Responsibility Act. &LR;  The Republican leadership
will stop cavorting with office vixens while attacking Democrats
for cavorting with office vixens. Affairs with comely young women
have always been a perk of power. But we realize now that girls in
the throes of heady secret love affairs with men running the
country tend to get giddy. They are prone to go out after work,
quaff a few Cosmopolitans and blab to a few dozen girlfriends. To
promote individual responsibility, these gratifying but risky
 &UR; droit-du-seigneur &LR;  liaisons will be sacrificed during periods when
the family-values GOP wants to impugn the free-love Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   2. &UR; The Family Reinforcement Act. &LR;  We will continue to encourage
the central role of families in American society. Sometimes dumping
your dumpy spouse in favor of a hot young thing is unavoidable.
Sometimes dumping that hot young thing in favor of a hotter young
thing is irresistible. But we will do our best not to leave a paper
trail that can allow the left to paint Republicans as frisky  &UR; and &LR; 
hypocritical. We must learn from the spectacular crash of our
former leader.
</P>
<P>
   Even as he was in the midst of a five-year affair with a Capitol
Hill aide, Callista Bisek, Newt dedicated his 1998 book, ``Lessons
Learned the Hard Way,'' to his wife, Marianne, and praised her as
``the woman I love ... my best friend and closest adviser.'' Ouch.
</P>
<P>
   3. &UR; The Common Sense Reform Act. &LR;  We won't drink before going on
``Nightline.''
</P>
<P>
   We won't do the booty call with sexy lobbyists.
</P>
<P>
   We won't dismiss things we did in our 40s as ``youthful
indiscretions.''
</P>
<P>
   We won't break up a marriage if we co-sponsored the Defense of
Marriage Act.
</P>
<P>
   4. &UR; The Taking Back Our Streets Act. &LR;  We will clean up the inner
cities. But the first street we need to take back is Pennsylvania
Avenue. We know ``compassionate conservatism'' is hogwash. We know
it's an implied criticism of us, that we're a bunch of
mean-spirited, unsmiling, minority-hating, school-lunch-eliminating
guys with bad haircuts and ugly attitudes. But we will grit our
teeth and line up behind George W. Bush. At least he won't take
away our soft money, like John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   5. &UR; The American Dream Restoration Act. &LR;  Who wants to help a
millionaire? We do! We will devise creative new ways to aid the
rich while giving the impression of easing taxes on Middle America.
We will raid the Social Security surplus while pretending to
protect it. We will pig out on pork projects for our districts
while accusing Democrats of wild spending sprees. We will dismantle
Medicare while masquerading as its saviors. We will make noises
about reducing the influence of money in politics while we really
increase it.
</P>
<P>
   Freedom works!

IS THE MET PHOBIC ABOUT CONTEMPORARY ART?  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 9) 
</HEADLINE>
  (af) 
 Deborah Solomon, the author of ``Utopia Parkway: The Life and Work
of Joseph Cornell,'' is writing a biography of Norman Rockwell.  
 
 By DEBORAH SOLOMON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ If asked to say what you love about the Metropolitan
Museum of Art, you might think of mummies or shining armor or
old-master paintings in curly gold frames. You might even think of
the grand central staircase, which, when you descend it, makes you
feel like an affluent if doomed character in a
turn-of-the-last-century Edith Wharton novel.
</P>
<P>
   But you probably wouldn't think of contemporary art. Virtually
since it opened in 1870, the Met has been accused of snubbing the
art of the present. That charge is particularly pronounced at the
moment, in the wake of an astonishingly candid article by the
museum's director, Philippe de Montebello. Countless citizens of
the art world are asking the same blunt question: Does de
Montebello hate contemporary art?
</P>
<P>
   ``No!'' he exclaimed on a recent afternoon. ``I don't hate
contemporary art. You'd have to be stupid to say yes to that
question. But what I object to is the tyrannical attitude of too
many people in the contemporary art world, who are so insecure that
they think that a divergence of opinion about a work of art
signifies hostility to the whole field.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the hundreds of articles written about the brouhaha at the
Brooklyn Museum of Art, whose ``Sensation'' show closes Sunday, few
have had as intense an afterlife as an Op-Ed piece by de Montebello
that appeared in The New York Times in October.
</P>
<P>
   In it, he lauded Mayor Rudolph Giuliani for his ``astute
critical acumen'' and dismissed the ``Sensation'' show as
unredeemed rubbish (``the emperor has no clothes''). He went on to
pick a fight with the Whitney Museum of American Art, singling out
a sculpture on view there _ Kiki Smith's ``Tale'' (1992), a
crouching female figure excreting a trail of dark matter _ as
``disgusting and devoid of any craft or aesthetic merit.''
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, mayors and senators make hostile comments like this
all the time. Indeed, we would think they were falling down on the
job if they didn't view cutting-edge art with grim-eyed suspicion.
Yet de Montebello is not a politician. At 63, he is one of
America's most respected museum directors, a man of vast
cultivation and erudition, someone who speaks six languages and
likes to spend his evenings immersed in the poetry of Verlaine. His
mellifluous baritone has acquainted millions of Met audioguide
listeners with the higher pleasures of art.
</P>
<P>
   So when he came up with an inelegant adjective _ ``disgusting''
_ to describe a Kiki Smith sculpture, he surprised a great number
of people, not least of all Ms. Smith, whose sculpture ``Lilith''
(1994), along with 19 prints, is owned by the Metropolitan Museum.
Ms. Smith, 45, a New Yorker, is known for sculptures of downcast
women that helped turn ``the body'' into one of the buzz words of
the current art scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't in the Met's interests for Philippe to speak out
that way,'' Ms. Smith said of the article. ``He got a lot of people
very upset. But I've had years of therapy, so I can afford not to
take it personally.''
</P>
<P>
   Among her longtime supporters is William S. Lieberman, the Met's
chairman of modern art. Asked what he thought of his boss' article,
Lieberman, 75, coughed. Then he said gruffly: ``That was his
personal opinion. It's not mine. I've loved Kiki's work ever since
I first saw it.''
</P>
<P>
   What is it with the Met, anyway? Although founded as an
encyclopedic museum that would ideally devote the same quality of
attention to the modern as to the medieval, the Met has had a
notoriously troubled relationship with contemporary art. Picketed
by Cubists in the '30s and boycotted by the Abstract Expressionists
in 1950, the Met has practically made a tradition out of alienating
each new generation of avant-garde artists.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think, on balance, the Met has a remarkably good record on
contemporary art,'' de Montebello insisted. ``We have collected
contemporary art since 1870. And we offer the most valuable thing
for contemporary art _ a continuum, the chance to see it as a
chapter in art history. When you see the works of Willem de Kooning
in this museum, such as his `Attic,' you can go downstairs and look
at the Pompeian frescoes which de Kooning states were especially
influential in his work.''
</P>
<P>
   De Kooning, of course, is not a contemporary artist, and hasn't
been one at least since his death in 1997. But de Montebello, who
was sitting in his spacious, book-lined office, where the single
most recent painting is a Salvator Rosa landscape circa 1656,
seemed reluctant to muse on the art of the 1990s at all. Suddenly
and comically, he mentioned he had hoped to become a stage actor
during his Harvard days, and recited a poem in Russian with
dramatic flair.
</P>
<P>
   Yet asked which contemporary artists he admires, he was
considerably more reserved. ``I've survived 22 years as director of
the Met,'' he explained, ``by never expressing opinions about my
favorites of anything.''
</P>
<P>
   When his visitor pointed out that his no-comment policy didn't
prevent him from publicly expressing his opinion of his least
favorite work _ the Kiki Smith _ de Montebello said with amusement:
``No, it's not my least favorite. You don't know what my least
favorite is. You have no idea!''
</P>
<P>
   The Met, of course, mounts exhibitions of living artists, many
of which have been huge and justly celebrated. It is easy to recall
landmark shows that provided New Yorkers with their first in-depth
look at a living (if aged) legend, like the Clyfford Still
retrospective of 1979, or the Balthus retrospective of 1984, or the
Lucian Freud exhibition of 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Smaller pocket shows take place regularly in the mezzanine
galleries of the museum's 20th-century wing; the latest one, ``Sean
Scully,'' featuring works on paper by the Dublin-born artist known
for his arresting, often lyrical arrangements of stripes and
checkerboards, opens on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Does the Met seek to showcase contemporary artists with any
particular frequency? Lieberman, who oversees all exhibitions of
20th-century art, appeared puzzled by the question.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is contemporary art?'' he asked with mild annoyance,
puffing on a cigarette as he sat in a conference room late one
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The period that follows modern art, his visitor replied. The
period since 1970.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Gracious!'' he exclaimed. ``In this department, we're dealing
with a period of just 100 years, so we don't need to break it up
into modern and contemporary.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman, a heavyset man with fiercely slanting eyebrows and an
endearingly cranky manner, is among the most esteemed scholars of
modern art in this country. Yet he is frequently criticized for
ignoring American masters in favor of British ones. In addition to
the Lucian Freud show, he has overseen exhibitions of David
Hockney, Henry Moore, Howard Hodgkin and R.B. Kitaj, the last of
whom, though born in Cleveland, spent decades in London and
specializes in figurative paintings whose dense literary narratives
can make them seem more English than afternoon tea.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about a British bias, Lieberman denied that he has one.
``People say it because they hear other people say it,'' he replied
a bit testily. ``I'm sorry. That's the reason. We have also given
shows to many American artists. We have given shows to Ivan
Albright, Charles Burchfield, Stuart Davis, Hans Hofmann, Georgia
O'Keeffe and Horace Pippin.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet none of those artists qualify as contemporary; all of them,
in fact, are dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``O'Keeffe was alive at the time of the show!'' Lieberman
protested.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, exhibitions aren't everything. Museums are also
judged on the strength of their permanent holdings, and Lieberman
regularly makes the rounds of galleries in search of works by
living artists to add to the Met's collection. While his affection
for Lucian Freud is well-known, he seems partial to younger English
artists as well _ including a few in the ``Sensation'' show.
</P>
<P>
   One recent Saturday Lieberman was in Chelsea, jet-lagged and
breathless. He had just returned from Tokyo and was rushing
directly from the airport to see a show of sculptures by Rachel
Whiteread opening that day. Ms. Whiteread is part of the
``Sensation'' pack denounced by de Montebello, as is Chris Ofili,
whose ``North Wales'' (1997), a suite of etchings, has been
purchased by the Met. ``He's a marvelous artist!'' Lieberman
exclaimed.
</P>
<P>
   American artists, by contrast, have often felt slighted by the
Met. Its love affair with Europe reflects a prejudice inherited
from the museum's early days, when Paris was still the world
capital of art and New York painters commanded about as much
prestige as plumbers. In 1929, the Met committed a now-historic
blunder after Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney, the bohemian heiress,
tried to give the museum her superb collection of more than 600
American paintings; she also offered a wing in which to house them.
The Met declined her gift, so the heiress built her own museum, the
Whitney Museum of American Art.
</P>
<P>
   Today, some of the most modern art at the Met is to be found
outside its Department of Modern Art. Consider ``Rock Style,''
which was organized by the Costume Institute and lends a radical
historicism to the clothing of Madonna, Mick Jagger and some 40-odd
performers who have shaped style since the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   Is it fair to assume that de Montebello listens to rock music?
``I have gone on many long drives with my teen-age children,'' he
replied, looking as if the scent of sour milk had suddenly
permeated the room. ``I've listened to a lot of rock music. I have
no choice.''
</P>
<P>
   But isn't there at least one contemporary performer who doesn't
offend his rarefied sensibilities?
</P>
<P>
   ``You remind me of Lt. Columbo,'' he replied. ``Do you know who
he is? He's a contemporary!''
</P>
<P>
   Pressed on the question, he acknowledged: ``I rather enjoy
listening to some of the Beatles' things. But I'd just as soon
listen to Brahms or Chopin.''
</P>
<P>
   His comments hardly amounted to a ringing endorsement of the
``Rock Style'' show. But then it is often said that one of de
Montebello's great virtues as a director is that he does not impose
his personal tastes on the Met's curators. He may not love Madonna
or Mick Jagger anymore than he does Ms. Smith or the artists in
``Sensation,'' but he certainly seems willing to indulge those who
believe that the art of the moment can hold its own beside the
treasures of the past.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, who could deny that every work of art was once a work
of contemporary art? Every painting hanging at the Met, from
Titians to Tiepolos to Bruegels, was once brand new, once gleamed
with wet pigment in someone's studio, was once in need of a
comprehending, compassionate eye. That might seem like reason
enough for the Met to support contemporary art.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't set out to support contemporary art,'' de Montebello
countered. ``We set out to build a collection that is as good as it
can be. For us, contemporary art is one in a multitude of fields. I
have 18 curatorial departments.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Here, in the city of New York,'' he continued, ``the greatest
museum of contemporary art is the aggregate of hundreds of
commercial galleries. That's the great museum of contemporary art,
the galleries.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a point that offers little consolation to the countless
contemporary artists who feel intensely connected to the Met, who
were first alerted to the greatness of the past as they stood in
front of a Rembrandt or a Manet in the museum's halls. No matter
how fiercely artists love the Met, the Met has not often loved them
back. Call it the museum of unrequited love.

BELICHICK SHOCKER: JETS' UNCERTAINTIES AREN'T FOR ME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB DUFFY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ His wardrobe was as drab as his reputation _
gray suit, white shirt, subdued tie _ but there might as well have
been a neon Flying Elvis flashing from Bill Belichick's lapel
Tuesday as he casually dropped a bombshell.
</P>
<P>
   On the day of his scheduled coronation as head coach of the New
York Jets, Belichick instead announced his resignation from the
organization. As team president Steve Gutman stood in the
background of the Jets' headquarters at Hofstra University
absorbing the numbing news, Belichick insisted repeatedly _ cross
his heart and hope to die _ that his departure was predicated
solely on the franchise's uncertain ownership situation and was
unrelated to the Patriots' expressed desire to discuss their
coaching vacancy with him.
</P>
<P>
   As the mouths of the pathologically cynical New York media
became frozen agape, the boss suddenly without portfolio
matter-of-factly read from the handwritten statement he had
submitted to Gutman and Belichick's mentor for 14 years in the NFL,
Bill Parcells, who had retired as coach the day before _ the same
day the Patriots cashiered their coach, Pete Carroll, and sent a
fax to the Jets requesting permission to talk with Belichick.
</P>
<P>
   The statement said, in part, ``Due to the various uncertainties
surrounding my position as it relates to the team's new ownership,
I have decided to resign as head coach of the New York Jets. I have
given this decision very careful consideration and would like to
wish the entire New York Jets organization . . . the very best of
luck for a prosperous future.''
</P>
<P>
   Gutman was having none of the bonhomie. He is basing the Jets'
future on something a bit more binding than Belichick's best
wishes: a binding contract in which Belichick agreed to become
Parcells's successor and was given a $1 million bonus to bide his
time until automatically assuming command.
</P>
<P>
   That was the fallout three years ago from the precursor to this
latest Patriots-Jets fandango. After guiding the Patriots to the
1997 Super Bowl, Parcells decided he no longer could coexist with
New England owner Bob Kraft and wanted to return to his beloved
native New Jersey as Jets football emperor. Back then, it was Kraft
who was wielding the ironclad document _ a contract with Parcells
that had another year to run _ and used it block the escape. So
Belichick, Parcells's chief lieutenant and defensive mastermind
through three Super Bowl trips and two championships, became the
front man in a facade.
</P>
<P>
   Belichick was installed as the Jets' interim head coach _ and
greeted the media as such; wink, wink _ until Parcells's Patriots
pact terminated. It turned out that the hostilities expired before
the contract, and a week later, Parcells was allowed to take over
the Jets immediately in return for draft picks granted New England
as compensation.
</P>
<P>
   That's when Belichick accepted the deferred gratification _ and
seven-figure consolation _ as presumptive heir, during which he
would serve as assistant head coach and de facto defensive
overseer. And that's what Gutman is using to prevent his
coach-for-a-day from heading elsewhere without a fight _ or at
least compensation that would constitute a reversal of Patriots vs.
Jets I.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have on at least five occasions in the past three years and
as recently as less than a year ago had signed contracts with Bill
Belichick which are clear, unambiguous, and specific with respect
to the areas of uncertainty that he has raised today insofar as
they relate to football and the New York Jets,'' said Gutman. ``Let
me assure you that (the concerns) have been addressed and signed,
reviewed, agreed, validated, accepted by (NFL commissioner) Paul
Tagliabue, as are all coaches' contracts, as recently as 12 months
ago.''
</P>
<P>
   To prove this was more than rhetoric, the team distributed a
statement from the league acknowledging the Jets' intention to
retain their contractual rights to Belichick and prohibiting any
other club from speaking with him ``unless further notified by this
office.''
</P>
<P>
   During his rambling 55 minutes of variations on a theme,
Belichick, 47, emphasized that all of this was moot to him, anyway.
He was making this calamitous move _ and seemingly betraying his
football godfather, Parcells _ because of what he considers an
untenable present, not because he has designs on a more lucrative
future.
</P>
<P>
   In Belichick's version, his initial agreement was with
benevolent hands-off owner Leon Hess, who died last May 7,
triggering a sale of the franchise that has taken far longer than
either of Belichick's New York coaching non-regimes. The
transaction was supposed to have been consummated long ago _ ``Bill
told us at the start of the month that Dec. 15 was the date,'' said
Belichick, ``and here it is Jan. 4'' _ but the team remains up for
grabs between cable television mogul Chuck Dolan and pharmaceutical
heir Robert Wood Johnson III.
</P>
<P>
   Because he is unsure how the move will affect his role, club
management, and Parcells's status as consultant/chief operating
officer, Belichick explained, he doubts he can muster ``the
commitment that needs to be made to run this team in the
circumstances that it's in right now.''
</P>
<P>
   His inspiration, bizarrely, was inadvertently provided by
Parcells during Monday's resignation press conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill talked about looking at yourself and knowing what you can
do and realizing what you can do,'' said Belichick. ``I just don't
feel at this time that I can lead the Jets with 100 percent
conviction into the year 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether he could coach another team _ say, one that plays its
home games at Foxboro Stadium _ with the necessary conviction is
not a consideration, Belichick reiterated.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the New England thing,'' he said, ``Tuesday I guess it was
reported that I was upset, that I was staying in my office because
the Jets denied permission (to talk with the Patriots) or whatever.
I didn't talk to anybody. I saw it on TV, as some of you did. I
talked to Bill about the situation (Monday) night. We had our
discussion and that's it.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Belichick said, he and Parcells have had countless
discussions about the chain of succession for more than a decade _
except for the five years when Belichick actually did hold a head
coaching job, with the Cleveland Browns, whom he guided to one
playoff berth before the franchise uprooted to Baltimore. The idea
that he has been groomed as Parcells's successor for years is a
misconception, Belichick maintained, because it seems that almost
every season since 1987, Parcells has been telling his protege, ``I
can't keep doing this. One more year and then it's yours.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time I hear it,'' Belichick said, ``I take it with a
little bit of a grain of salt.''
</P>
<P>
   Until Monday morning, that is, ``when (Parcells) made me aware
this was his final decision. This was it. Until it was, `This is
what I'm going to do,' then I really started to think, `Well, OK,
this is what I've got to do.' My real determination of taking this
job and being in this job started Monday morning at 9 or whenever
it was. That's when reality set in.''
</P>
<P>
   That's far shorter notice than the clauses in Belichick's Jets
contract would indicate. While the reality was setting in and
Parcells was announcing his decision, skeptics wondered why the
reclusive Belichick didn't emerge from his office for the official
transfer of power. He explained that he didn't want to ruin
Parcells's day in the sun, but in fact, he was preparing to ride
off into the sunset.
</P>
<P>
   Belichick and Parcells _ who was unavailable to the media at
Hofstra Tuesday _ had discussed often and at length what
permutations new ownership might create.
</P>
<P>
   Belichick said he raised the subject again Monday morning and
Parcells told him, ``You know, maybe if you feel that uncertain
about it, maybe you should think about just not taking this job.''
</P>
<P>
   Belichick took him up on that, though not before he had
discussed his misgivings with his wife and three children Monday
night and done some further soul-searching Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   The clincher, according to Belichick, came when he was riding
the treadmill Tuesday next to defensive back Kevin Williams, who
had overcome a life-threatening lung infection to return to the
team. Now that was real commitment, Belichick figured, the same as
was being made to a lesser extent by some Jets players he gazed at
on the practice field below. It was then that he returned to his
office and wrote out his abdication.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now my long-term future is tonight,'' he said. ``I'm
going to pick up my kids from school, I'm going to have dinner with
them _ which is something I don't get to do that often _ and I'm
ging to talk to them about my decision and what I'm going to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Which may be nothing, he added with a straight face.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm fortunate in that my wife is pretty thrifty,'' said
Belichick. ``She's clipped coupons, she's been able to save some
money, and I feel we're going to be able to live comfortably for a
while.''
</P>
<P>
   Until Bob Kraft _ or some other NFL owner _ ensures that he'll
live comfortably for quite a while.

OTHER TEAMS EVEN LESS DESERVING THAT COWBOYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   All kidding aside.
</P>
<P>
   The Dallas Cowboys deserve to be in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Now, stop laughing.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, they're 8-8.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, they lost of six of their past nine games, including the
Christmas Eve embarrassment against the New Orleans Saints.
</P>
<P>
   But, at least, they had to do something to get in. And,
technically-speaking, beating the half-dead New York Giants on
Sunday ranks as doing something.
</P>
<P>
   That's more than can be said for Saint Jimmy's Miami Dolphins
(9-7), who lost six of their past eight games, including the season
finale, and backed into the playoffs because of what someone else
did or didn't do. Remember, part of Miami's late plunge was a 20-0
setback to these Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   Also, when talking about teams that don't deserve to get in, the
Detroit Lions (8-8) should be put ahead of Cowboys. They head into
the playoffs riding a four-game losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   Don't forget the Seattle Seahawks (9-7); they lost five of their
last six, including the season finale, and still won a division
title.
</P>
<P>
   So, if the Cowboys don't deserve to be there, then they are not
alone.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the NFL is not college football, where
tradition-rich Notre Dame once turned down a bowl bid because it
was unhappy with its season.
</P>
<P>
   So, while history says the haughty Cowboys' franchise is above
its 8-8 record and mediocre play in 1999, they are not too proud to
stumble into the playoffs for one last chance at glory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, you want to have home field and all that,'' Cowboys
coach Chan Gailey said. ``But what you really want is to be in the
playoffs. That's the minimum. Because you need to be in to have a
chance.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, more than any other in recent memory, having a chance
means something.
</P>
<P>
   The St. Louis Rams are the only team in the NFC that has played
well from start to finish. The Cowboys' woes have been well
documented. But everybody else has had a flawed campaign as well,
and go into the playoffs with warts.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line is that if they determined Super Bowl
participants based on regular-season accomplishments, then the
Vikings would not be heading into the playoffs bent on erasing
memories of last season's wasted 15-1 record.
</P>
<P>
   Now, we're not here predicting some historic run.
</P>
<P>
   No 8-8 team has won a playoff game. The Cowboys have lost seven
consecutive games on the road and they haven't won a road game
against an opponent not in the NFC East since 1997.
</P>
<P>
   So, long shots? Yes.
</P>
<P>
   Undeserving? No.
</P>
<P>
   And if anybody has what it takes to make the most of this
minimal opportunity, it's these Cowboys. Much has been made about
their inexperience and injuries. And sure, 38 guys don't own Super
Bowl rings.
</P>
<P>
   But, unlike the other playoff participants, they will take the
field Sunday with 15 guys who have at least one Super Bowl ring
from their glory days of 1992, '93 and '95.
</P>
<P>
   If facing a daunting task, isn't it comforting to be surrounded
by a few guys who have done it before? Tucker getting the ball Much
has been made about former TCU standout Jason Tucker's recent
emergence as a go-to receiver for the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   It has been asserted that his emergence came because Tucker is
finally getting a grasp of the offense and developing into a good
receiver worthy of quarterback Troy Aikman's trust.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that Tucker had the offense down cold in training
camp, so much so that he helped teach it to some of the other
receivers.
</P>
<P>
   Tucker's emerging play is more the result of him getting an
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   As receivers coach Dwain Painter put it: ``It's amazing what you
can do when you get an opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Translation: It's amazing what you can do when the ball is
thrown to you.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't that Tucker wasn't getting open; he just wasn't
getting the ball like the other receivers not named Raghib Ismail.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody is predicting Tucker will be another Jerry Rice or
Michael Irvin _ Tucker is considered by most as a solid third
receiver _ but he could have done some of the things he has done
the past two weeks before now.
YARDSTICKS First Down
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys enter the playoffs with more postseason victories in
the past decade than any team remaining, not to mention being the
only team with more than one Super Bowl title in the 1990s. The
Cowboys have three. The Redskins have one. No one else has any.
Second down
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys are appearing in the NFC wild-card game for the
seventh time. They are 4-2 in past appearances, including last
season's 20-7 loss to the Arizona Cardinals. The Cowboys' last
victory in the wild-card game was a 40-15 shellacking of the
Vikings in 1996. The Cowboys' last wild-card road game was in 1991
when they beat the Chicago Bears, 17-13. Fourth Down
</P>
<P>
   Former Texas A&AMP;M star Dat Nguyen finished the regular season as
the team leader in special-teams tackles with 18. Safety Chris
Akins and linebacker Lemanski Hall, who joined the team midway
through the season, finished second and third with 15 and 14
tackles, respectively.

STOCKS PLUMMET BROADLY ON INTEREST-RATE JITTERS

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stock prices fell sharply in the United States and
Europe on Tuesday amid concerns that interest rates will rise
higher than had been anticipated. End-of-year tax moves and
investing strategies were also cited as reasons.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average had its worst day since the
autumn of 1998, when world markets were roiled by Asian economic
problems and the collapse of the Russian ruble.
</P>
<P>
   All the main U.S. indexes fell by at least 3 percent, with the
Dow dropping 359.58 points, or 3.2 percent, to 10,997.93. But the
worst performance, a fall of 5.6 percent, to 3,901.69, was recorded
by the Nasdaq composite index, which was the best performer of 1999
with a gain of 86 percent. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index
was down 55.8 points, or 3.8 percent, to 1,399.42. There were also
declines of 2 percent or more in most major European indexes and
some Asian markets. But the Japanese market managed a small gain.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Greenspan, who on Tuesday was nominated for another term as
Federal Reserve chairman, is widely expected to push short-term
interest rates up another notch when the ederal Open Market
Committee meets in February, but concern has grown in recent days
that further increases may also be in store after that. In the
past, higher rates have often hurt stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Steinberg, chief economist at Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., said
Tuesday that he expected the Fed to raise rates twice, and added
that ``the risk is for more after that.'' He said the bond market
could fall sharply if the employment report to be released Friday
showed the economy was stronger than expected.
</P>
<P>
   The bond market had fallen sharply Monday, but it regained some
of those losses Tuesday, as stock prices tumbled.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stock market couldn't ignore the bond market forever and
ever, and maybe today is the day,'' said Jeffrey Applegate, the
chief U.S. strategist at Lehman Brothers. He noted that interest
rates, both long-term and short-term, rose during much of 1999,
even as stock prices also increased.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there was little new to explain the sudden fall in stock
prices, a fact that left analysts searching for seasonal
explanations. Investors with large capital gains had a good reason
to delay selling until the new year _ and thus not owe the taxes
until April 15, 2001, rather than selling at the end of December
and owing the money this year. Moreover, institutional investors
may have wanted to buy stocks at the end of the year so that their
year-end portfolios would show they were fully invested, rather
than holding onto cash, and thus had no money left to invest now.
</P>
<P>
   ``This should be seen in the context of the last four to six
weeks, in which there were significant inflows into the market,''
said Abby Joseph Cohen, a partner and chief equity strategist at
Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. ``The magnitude of the selloff is a little
surprising,'' she added. ``But the fundamentals did not abruptly
change from last week to this week.'' Ms. Cohen, who has been the
most bullish, and most accurate, strategist in recent years, has
forecast a gain of around 8 percent for the market this year.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cohen said fears about rising interest rates are overblown.
``Over the last month, bond yields have climbed to a fairly high
level of between 6.5 percent and 6.6 percent, with underlying
inflation at between 2 percent and 2.5 percent,'' she said. ``The
Fed will raise short-term rates, but we don't think there is much
more damage to come at the long end of the yield curve.''
</P>
<P>
   Other analysts painted Tuesday's drop in stock prices as a mild
reaction to the explosive rise recorded in late 1999. ``An awful
lot of money had been made in a very short period of time,'' said
Laszlo Birinyi, who runs his own stock market research firm,
adding, ``This is only a correction.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan is widely respected on Wall Street, given credit both
for saving the banks after they ran into problems a decade ago and
for helping to engineer the current period of economic growth,
which will soon become the longest in the nation's history. ``You'd
have thought the market would go up 300 points on Greenspan's
reappointment,'' said Byron Wien, an equity strategist for Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter. ``The fact the market didn't go up is
troubling.''
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Cliggott, U.S. equity strategist at J.P. Morgan
Securities, said one factor pushing interest rates higher and
stocks lower might be Fed actions to reverse the flow of billions
of dollars into the economy at the end of last year, when the Fed
wanted to assure that the transition to 2000 would go smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   The declines in Europe, which included a 3.8 percent drop in the
leading British index, a 2.4 percent fall in the leading German
index and a 4.2 percent plunge in the French index, were blamed
both on expectations of higher interest rates there and on a
reaction to Monday's declines in U.S. stock prices, when the Dow
fell 139.61 points.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the 1990s, the U.S. stock market had frequent bad
days, but usually bounced back quickly as investors took advantage
of lower prices. For example, on April 19, 1999, the Nasdaq
composite plunged 5.56 percent, virtually the same amount it fell
Tuesday, as technology stocks had an especially bad day. The market
bounced back quickly, recovering the entire loss in two days.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, January has often been a good month for stocks,
but that has not always held true at the beginnings of decades.
Yale Hirsch of the Hirsch Organization, a market research firm,
said the Standard &AMP; Poor's index of 500 stocks has gone up in 33 of
the past 50 Januaries. But the three worst performances, with
declines ranging from 6.9 percent to 7.6 percent, came in 1970,
1960 and 1990.
</P>
<P>
   After two trading days this year, the S&AMP;P 500 is down 4.8
percent, a result in part of big drops in bellwether technology
names like America Online, Oracle and Microsoft. Tuesday, the S&AMP;P
fell 55.8 points.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 small-cap stock index shed 18.04, or 3.6
percent, to 478.38, and is down 5.2 percent in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite, which had been alone in moving to a new
high on Monday, fell 5.55 percent. Internet companies like Yahoo
and CMGI, which were darlings for much of last year, were hammered.
Yahoo fell $32, to $443. CMGI, the Internet holding company, lost
$32 11/16, to $293 3/4. Cisco Systems dropped $6 1/16, to $102.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest losers among Dow stocks included Hewlett-Packard,
off 8| to 108 9/16, American Express, down 5 15/16, to 151 5/16,
General Electric, off 5 13/16, to 144 3/16, and J.P. Morgan, down 6
1/16, to 115 3/8. Financial stocks were especially hard hit. Volume
was heavy, but not spectacular. Volume on the Nasdaq was 1.49
billion shares, while Big Board turnover was 990 million shares.

SEARS EXPECTS ROBUST EARNINGS, BUT ANALYSTS DOUBT A RECOVERY 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By LESLIE KAUFMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Co. said on Tuesday that its fourth-quarter
earnings would sharply exceed expectations, but analysts cautioned
against characterizing the anticipated profit increase as a sign
that the troubled merchant had turned its fortunes around.
</P>
<P>
   Sears, based in Hoffman Estates, Ill., will not disclose its
earnings until later this month, but it said it expected them to
rise by as much as 20 percent compared with the results in the
quarter a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   But the expected profits at Sears, the nation's second-largest
retailer, would not come from increased sales. In fact, in the
critical holiday-shopping month of December, Sears said sales in
stores open at least a year declined six-tenths of a percent, while
the rest of the industry saw a robust rise around 6 percent.
Instead, the company attributed the windfall to decisions not to
offer steep cuts in prices to promote merchandise, as it did the
previous Christmas, and to improvements in its credit card
operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are seeing improved margin performance in our full-line
stores, strong performance in our international and credit
businesses, as well as solid results from our cost-containment
measures,'' Arthur C. Martinez, the company's chairman and chief
executive, said in a written statement.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Sears rose $1.50 on Tuesday, to $31.5625.
</P>
<P>
   While analysts credited the company with efficient cost-cutting
and promotional sales, many questioned whether such measures could
sustain earnings growth this year. Despite Sears' attempts to
revamp its clothing offerings to make them more fashionable and
appealing, apparel sales have continued to be disappointing. The
company has fared better in electronics and home furnishings, but
it faces increasingly harsh competition from both chains like
Circuit City and discounters like Target, a unit of Dayton Hudson.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts indicated they would have to see evidence that Sears
had stanched the loss of market share before they could be bullish
on the stock. ``At the end of day, investors have to see top-line
growth,'' said George Strachan of Goldman, Sachs.
</P>
<P>
   Sears credited the improvements in its credit card business
primarily to a robust economy. With more money in their wallets,
fewer customers were defaulting on card payments or not paying
their bills on time. In November, Sears raised the late fee on its
card _ the penalty charged customers who fail to pay a bill on time
for the second time _ to $25 from $20. Such an increase could
encourage further compliance from cardholders in the future but did
not affect the fourth quarter, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts, most of whom estimated that the improvements in
the credit card division accounted for about 50 percent of the
earnings increase, worried that such income could quickly disappear
if the Federal Reserve raises interest rates and the economy slows.
``We are entering a period of possible credit crunch,'' said
Richard Church, a retail analyst with Salomon Smith Barney. ``How
will Sears weather that if it materializes?''
</P>
<P>
   The company has a history of relying on credit card revenue to
bolster its bottom line in troubled times. Looking to increase
lagging sales when he joined the company from Saks Fifth Avenue in
1992, Martinez relaxed its standards and offered credit cards to
shoppers with lower incomes who were higher credit risks. Sales of
merchandise skyrocketed, but so did defaults on bills. By 1998, 7.3
percent of cardholders were not paying their bills. Flooded in red
ink, Sears began to lean heavily on customers who owed them money.
Last February, it pleaded guilty to federal changes that it had
illegally forced cardholders who had filed for personal bankruptcy
to pay their Sears debts anyway.
</P>
<P>
   About 62 million American households have Sears credit cards,
making Sears the second-largest card issuer behind GE Capital,
according to The Nilson Report, a credit industry newsletter.

LARGEST, OLDEST BAY STATE HMO IN RECEIVERSHIP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK PHILLIPS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The state placed Harvard Pilgrim Health Care into
receivership after the financially troubled HMO reported losses of
$177 million, far higher than what had been anticipated for 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Supreme Judicial Court Chief Justice Margaret Marshall put the
state's largest HMO under supervision of Insurance Commissioner
Linda Ruthardt, acting on a request from Attorney General Thomas
Reilly.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard Pilgrim released a statement saying its 1.1 million
Massachusetts members would continue to ``receive care and
coverage.''
</P>
<P>
   The HMO blamed its problems on the discovery of ``several errors
in past accounting practices that substantially increased our
projections of 1999 losses.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that (Reilly and Ruthardt) have acted in the best
interest of Harvard Pilgrim and our members in taking this
action,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Chief executive officer Charles Baker was not available for
comment Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard Pilgrim had earlier projected it would lose $134 million
last year. Ruthardt described Harvard Pilgrim's 1999 losses as ``at
least $150 million'' while Reilly insisted losses totalled $177
million.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Harvard Pilgrim said it faced debts it had not
anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   Under the court order, Ruthardt will oversee financial
operations of the non-profit insurer, the oldest HMO in
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly said he had to move quickly to obtain the court order to
prevent creditors from using the US Bankruptcy Court to disrupt
Harvard Pilgrim's ability to provide patient care. Creditors could
ask the court to freeze Harvard Pilgrim's assets, or force the HMO
to sell assets to pay its bills, Reilly said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sought this action to make sure Harvard's clients would
have a continuity of medical care,'' Reilly said. ``We want to make
sure that legal measures in place that business would continue as
usual and that doctors and patients and hospitals should not panic
or overreact.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruthardt said she is confident that under her supervision and
with protection from creditors that Harvard Pilgrim can regain its
financial stability.
</P>
<P>
   ``The request to the court is called a `petition for
conservation and rehabilitation' and that's an indication we
obviously believe it is possible,'' Ruthardt said.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State William F. Galvin, who has sought to
strengthen state regulation of HMO's, said the court order will
have major reverberations throughout the health care system in
Massachusetts because of the HMO's size.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a huge effect on all the health care systems in the
state,'' Galvin said.
</P>
<P>
   The sudden move by Harvard Pilgrim comes after months during
which its executives have sought to downplay its financial woes.
Baker had insisted the insurer would win its struggle to regain
financial stability.
</P>
<P>
   Baker had claimed the HMO had at least $100 million in reserves
and its recovery plan was working. Still, the insurer faced huge
financial obligations, including large debts to vendors and
Massachusetts hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard Pilgrim helped push a bill through the legislature late
last year that shielded it from US Bankruptcy Court, where its
creditors would have a strong position to recover debts. The new
law specifically allowed the HMO to define itself as an insurance
company, which, under federal statute, allows the state to act as a
receiver through its insurance commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   The HMO has close ties to the administration. Baker, who served
from 1991 through 1997 in top administration cabinet posts, is
close to Gov. Paul Cellucci. His last position was secretary of
administration and finance. At the time the bill was pending,
Galvin, a critic of the state's lack of HMO regulations, warned
that the legislation was designed especially to protect Harvard
Pilgrim.
</P>
<P>
   The receivership cancels a state financial agency's plan to sell
up to $147 million in tax exempt bonds to investors this month to
help rescue the HMO. The plan called for the Massachusetts Health
and Educational Facilities Authority, through a subsidiary, to
purchase Harvard's eight Boston area health centers and then lease
facilities back to the HMO.
</P>
<P>
   Authority executive director Robert Ciolek said Tuesday that the
bond sale ``is on an indefinite hold.'' He said HEFA would be open
to further consideration in the future.
</P>
<P>
   The deal had raised questions because of Baker's political ties
and its size. HEFA's board is appointed by the governor.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed bond sale came a month after the agency quietly
approved a plan to loan Harvard Pilgrim up to $90 million in
exchange for liens on the HMO's furniture, telecommunications
equipment, computers, and software.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard Pilgrim also created a firestorm in Rhode Island when it
announced last year that it was shutting down its money-draining
subsidiary there. The state froze its assets and took over the
125,000-member operation in October. State regulators and
legislators have opened inquiries into the insurer's decision,
saying they are concerned Harvard has left behind huge unpaid
financial obligations.

ARISTOCRAT, DEMOCRAT AND SUFFERING WIFE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JAN. 9) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By KATHRYN SHATTUCK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   To her admirers, she was manna from heaven, an unwavering voice
for the downtrodden and oppressed. To her detractors, she was a
dangerous meddler, a dilettante, a traitor to her class. On one
point, however, these opponents shared the same view: for more than
30 years, Eleanor Roosevelt was the most powerful woman in America.
</P>
<P>
   Monday at 9 p.m., PBS inaugurates the 12th season of the
``American Experience'' series with ``Eleanor Roosevelt,'' a
two-and-a-half hour documentary about the woman who was widely
considered among the finest politicians of the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   The film was made ``to rediscover Eleanor Roosevelt in light of
new scholarship: brave, opinionated, passionate and big-hearted,''
said Kathryn Dietz, a co-producer of the documentary.
</P>
<P>
   That new scholarship includes ``Eleanor Roosevelt, Volume I:
1884-1933,'' published in 1992, the first book in Blanche Wiesen
Cook's projected three-volume biography. (The second volume was
published last year.) Ms. Cook sees Roosevelt as a woman for our
times. ``I think Eleanor Roosevelt has so gripped the imagination
of this moment because we need her and her vision so completely,''
she said. ``She stands for justice and dignity. She's a woman who
worked hard to live a full life. She had a global vision in a time
of war and cruelty.''
</P>
<P>
   The film's portrait is of a multidimensional woman, both
politically astute and often emotionally repressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hesitate to say that the personal is political and vice
versa, but it really was with Eleanor,'' said Sue Williams, the
film's writer, director and other co-producer. ``Her childhood was
so painful and tragic, and the way she gained approval was through
the helping of others. And that sort of expanded exponentially in
the political life. I think there was a sort of poignancy in her
search for intimacy.''
</P>
<P>
   Years later political pundits would call her ``the best of the
Roosevelts,'' but for the impeccable pedigree hers was an
inauspicious beginning. Born on Oct. 11, 1884, in New York City to
Elliott and Anna Hall Roosevelt, the shy, homely Eleanor lived her
young life as an anathema to her beautiful mother and so sought
comfort in the affection of her charming but alcoholic father.
</P>
<P>
   When Anna died of diphtheria in 1892, Eleanor and her two
younger brothers were sent to live with Anna's sternly religious
mother; Elliott paid only sporadic visits. He was soon
institutionalized, and he died in 1894, leaving his 10-year-old
daughter devastated and orphaned.
</P>
<P>
   At 15, Eleanor was sent to Allenswood, a boarding school outside
London, run by the feminist Marie Souvestre, to whom she became
immediately devoted. There, this awkward adolescent found her
footing during the three years she described as the happiest of her
life. On weekends, when the girls sent bouquets to their favorite
friends, Eleanor's room was a veritable garden.
</P>
<P>
   By the time she returned to New York, in 1902, Eleanor had been
transformed. Dressed in European couture, she cut a stylish figure,
tall and slender with abundant golden hair and aristocratic
bearing. Self-assured, energetic and, at last, happy, she made her
formal debut into society as a stimulating conversationalist,
albeit one not terribly interested in small talk, and a graceful
dancer.
</P>
<P>
   Among those whose eye she caught was Franklin Delano Roosevelt,
her handsome and dashing fifth cousin. After a secret engagement,
they had an elegant society wedding at which an uncle, President
Theodore Roosevelt, gave her away. In 1905, a bride at 20, Eleanor
had entered into one of the century's most formidable partnerships.
</P>
<P>
   But the promise gave way to bitter disappointment. By 1916
Eleanor had given birth to six children, one of whom died as an
infant. Although tender with her friends, Eleanor, like Anna, could
be a cold, withholding mother and wife. Simultaneously, she was
dealing with a controlling mother-in-law who bought herself and the
young couple adjoining townhouses in New York and insisted that her
grandchildren consider her their ``real mother.''
</P>
<P>
   When Franklin Jr. died at the age of 7 months in 1909, ``it was
a devastating thing,'' said Eleanor Seagraves, a granddaughter.
(Another son, born in 1914, was also named Franklin Jr.)
</P>
<P>
   ``She tended to blame herself for everything that went wrong in
the household,'' Ms. Seagraves continued. ``She was really very
depressed.''
</P>
<P>
   For her entire life, Eleanor struggled with what she called her
``Griselda moods,'' dark depressions that incapacitated her. ``If
anyone looks at me, I want to weep,'' she wrote. ``My mind goes
round and round like a squirrel in a cage. I want to run and I
can't and I despise myself.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In 1913, living in Washington, where Franklin was secretary of
the Navy, Eleanor found the city ``the most interesting place to
be.'' But Franklin grew enamored of its night life and spent less
and less time with her and their children. When Eleanor discovered,
in 1918, of his affair with her social secretary, Lucy Mercer, the
floor dropped out of her world.
</P>
<P>
   The film contends that Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt never
again lived as husband and wife, and their presumed extramarital
relationships _ later, he with his own secretary, Missy LeHand,
and, shortly before his death, with Mercer once again; she with
Lorena Hickok, an Associated Press reporter, and later Earl Miller,
a New York State trooper _ were the source of speculation.
</P>
<P>
   But at a time when the media were more content to allow public
figures private lives, it was Eleanor the politician who captured
the imagination of Americans through her husband's tenure as
governor of New York and his three full terms as president.
</P>
<P>
   The civil rights leader James Farmer said of her, ``She acted
out of conscience; she spoke from conscience.'' Secretary of State
John Foster Dulles called her ``more subversive and dangerous than
Moscow.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those sharing Dulles' view was J. Edgar Hoover, who
scorned the First Lady's close friendship with Joe Lash, the
student leader of the multiracial American Youth Congress. ``This
is nauseating,'' the FBI Director scrawled on one of the more than
3,000 pages in her file, among the largest ever compiled.
</P>
<P>
   Eleanor did not waver. ``Every woman in public life needs to
develop skin as tough as rhinoceros hide,'' she wrote. She was the
first president's wife to testify before a congressional committee,
the first to hold press conferences and the first to speak before a
national party convention, as she did at the behest of her husband
on the eve of his nomination to a third term.
</P>
<P>
   Far from toeing her husband's party line, she could be an
outspoken adversary in her syndicated newspaper column against any
actions she found lacking. A proponent of adequate housing and
across-the-board equality, she was vilified for her stand on civil
rights; in the 1950s the Ku Klux Klan placed a bounty on her head.
Undeterred, she and an elderly companion drove through the South
with a revolver on the front seat of their car.
</P>
<P>
   In 1945, the year of FDR's death, Eleanor was appointed the
United States representative to the newly formed United Nations.
Initially ridiculed by her male colleagues, she quickly earned
their respect and won passage, in December 1948, of the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights.
</P>
<P>
   Eleanor spent her later years in the simple solitude of
Val-Kill, her home in Hyde Park, N.Y., surrounded by old political
allies, new friends and an abundance of family members, who
discovered an Eleanor mellowed with age.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was just a wonderful grandmother, and we tend to look at
her as a grandmother, not as a public figure,'' said Nina Roosevelt
Campbell, the daughter of Eleanor's youngest son, John. ``She was a
woman who had the true courage of her convictions, and she didn't
do the things that she did for any other reasons than to make the
world a better place for people less fortunate than herself.''
</P>
<P>
   That legacy, Ms. Cook said, explains the public's renewed
interest in a woman who not so long ago was thought dowdy and
degradingly self-effacing.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's perfect for us as we enter the 21st century,'' she
added. ``Eleanor Roosevelt is a loud and profound voice for people
who want to change the world.''

SPORTS COLUMN: FRETTING OVER THE LURE OF A BIG OFFER FROM THE
PATRIOTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bill Belichick was in his office before 5 a.m. Tuesday, fretting
about his future, literally deciding at the last minute to abandon
the Jets. As is often the case, his look was slightly disheveled,
but appearances in the National Football League are often not what
they seem, especially in this bizarre case of ``Will the Real Jets
Head Coach Please Stand Up?'' Belichick may sometimes look like he
just rolled out of a washing machine, but he is also brilliant,
analytical, and maybe even conniving, and at this point he is also,
quite possibly, the next general manager and coach of the New
England Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   Though things could change drastically, and seemingly do by the
minute, the Patriots, according to a team executive, are
considering making Belichick the director of football operations
and head coach. They are considering making Belichick among the
five highest-paid coaches in the game. And if necessary, the
Patriots' owner, Robert K. Kraft, is prepared to give up draft
picks to secure Belichick. That same executive believes if the
Patriots did indeed recruit Belichick, it might cost the franchise
a first-, second- and third-round pick, though no one knows for
certain what the exact compensation might be.
</P>
<P>
   What we have here, as they like to say in the military, is a
situation. A weird, Twilight Zone-type of deal, in which the
Patriots might be sending the Jets draft picks as compensation for
the rights to Belichick in much the same way that the Jets, three
years ago, sent New England first-, second-, third- and
fourth-round selections over three drafts as compensation for Bill
Parcells.
</P>
<P>
   Another day, another feud between the Jets and Patriots and,
along with it, more hatred between Parcells and Kraft. Not only may
Kraft try to steal Parcells' former right-hand man, he might have
help from Belichick himself while doing it.
</P>
<P>
   And the man who again could be called upon to sort out what may
end up as a terrific mess is NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue, the
great pacifier, who can get feuding owners into his office and have
people walking out feeling as if they won something.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft wants Belichick in the worst way. He thinks Belichick is
the missing piece that can get New England back to the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Someone else on the Patriots also likes Belichick, according to
a team executive. Quarterback Drew Bledsoe had a good relationship
with Belichick when the latter was a Patriots assistant in 1996,
when they won the AFC championship. And Kraft has a relationship
with Bledsoe that is similar to the one that the Dallas owner Jerry
Jones has with quarterback Troy Aikman, who owns an inordinate
amount of say, for a player, on how the organization should be run.
Bledsoe has just as much input and would be very happy if Belichick
ended up in New England.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, to paraphrase Belichick's words Tuesday, there are so
many uncertainties in this situation, it is impossible to tell what
will happen. Some in the Patriots organization, directly
contradicting others, are quick to point out that any suggestion
stating Belichick's arrival in New England is imminent is
completely exaggerated. As proof, they pointed to the fact that on
Tuesday, the Patriots asked permission to speak with the Denver
Broncos' offensive coordinator, Gary Kubiak, who then told the
Patriots he was not interested.
</P>
<P>
   If the Patriots wanted Belichick so badly, these team officials
said, why begin the interview process with Kubiak and others?
Another person in the Patriots organization said he was concerned
about Belichick's at times rambling, and even unnerving, remarks to
reporters Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But is all of this simply a great game of poker?
</P>
<P>
   After all, why would someone like Belichick, who weighs
everything in his life carefully, leave a head-coaching job with
nothing else in hand? It is hard to believe that Belichick would
abandon a prestigious position that paid over $1 million a year on
a team that has a chance to make it to the Super Bowl unless he
knew that another such position, a possibly better position, one
that did not include the meddlesome Parcells, existed. And
Belichick's intentions to coach next year, wherever that may be,
became fairly clear when it was announced late Tuesday that his
lawyer planned to file a grievance with the NFL over his Jets
contract.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft would never risk violating the league's tampering rules by
speaking directly with Belichick, since Belichick is under contract
with the Jets for three more years. But as happens every day in
professional football, a message can be sent covertly, not exactly
breaking the tampering rules, but bending them a little. Belichick
could have been contacted through back channels and been given
promises on behalf of Kraft.
</P>
<P>
   Belichick's contract has been more scrutinized than a Donald
Trump prenuptial agreement. The man with the biggest microscope has
been Jets president Steve Gutman, who, when it comes to contracts,
misses nothing. The league has also reviewed it, and it is
ironclad. Belichick is not getting out of it. So the question
becomes: Will Kraft give up draft picks to get Belichick? The
answer is probably.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets' hierarchy is so embarrassed and infuriated, that if
team officials could, they would prevent anyone from ever again
speaking Belichick's name, a sort of Gang Green curse. After less
than 24 hours, his head-coaching career in New York is over. But in
New England, it might just be beginning.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCHESTER, N.Y. _ Determined to conclude one of the longest and
ugliest chapters in criminal justice history, a federal judge
announced Tuesday that the inmates who were beaten and tortured
during the 1971 Attica prison uprising would receive a settlement
of $8 million from New York state.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement, which provides an additional $4 million for
lawyers' fees, is believed to be the biggest ever in a prisoners'
rights case. But it may also be remembered as one of the longest
and most vexing to hammer out, coming 25 years after a class-action
civil suit was filed on behalf of 1,281 inmates over the storming
of the western New York prison by state troopers. The uprising and
siege left 43 people dead and more than 80 wounded.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's agreement, in U.S. District Court here, still requires
the approval of the inmates who can be located, and the judge,
Michael Telesca, faces the daunting task of apportioning the money
according to each inmate's suffering from the incident.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Even so, everyone involved in the case sounded cautiously
optimistic, saying that the matter could be wrapped up by year's
end. If that happens, the settlement will herald the end of a
tragic episode that left a scar on the country's cultural and
political psyche.
</P>
<P>
   ``The settlement lifts a tremendous emotion for the parties and
for this community. We have all suffered,'' Telesca said at
Tuesday's hearing, before a small crowd of lawyers, former inmates
and reporters. ``The end is in sight.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   About 400 inmates are expected to weigh in on whether the
settlement is a fair one by the court-imposed deadline of
mid-February, said Joe Heath, one of the inmates' lawyers. Another
400 may be dead, he said, while the others may either be
uninterested or unable to be located.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement does not come anywhere near the $2.8 billion the
plaintiffs originally sought in 1974. But for the lawyers, former
inmates and supporters who never abandoned the fight, the issue was
never money: it was holding the government accountable for its
actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody can feel bad about what happened at Attica, but
there's no amount of money that can compensate,'' said Frank B.B.
Smith, 66, a former inmate who suffered perhaps the worst injuries
from the brutal reprisals that followed the uprising.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who was assaulted, burned and threatened with castration
and death, has since moved to Queens and works as a paralegal,
dedicating himself to prisoners' rights cases.
</P>
<P>
   In the settlement, the state, acting on behalf of several former
state police and correction officials, agreed to set aside $12
million, with about $8 million specifically for prisoners. As is
customary in settlements, the defendants admitted neither liability
nor wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   The defendants were Vincent Mancusi, the former superintendent
of Attica; Karl Pfeil, the former deputy warden; the estate of
Russell Oswald, who was commissioner of the Department of
Correctional Services; and the estate of John Monahan, who was
commander of the state police in Batavia.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``We're exceedingly relieved that it has been settled,'' said
Richard Moot, Mancusi's lawyer. ``He enormously regrets the riot
ever took place, and he regrets the loss of life and injury
involved in the retaking of the prison.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Should the inmates reach a consensus to accept the settlement,
Telesca will hold hearings to divide the money according to factors
like the extent of a plaintiff's injuries, and the extent to which
the injuries affected his future earnings potential. And while the
figures are expected to vary widely, the average, roughly, could be
about $20,000 per inmate _ not a great amount, but nothing to
sneeze at, either, said the inmates' lawyers.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``If they don't accept this settlement, the litigation will
continue, and they won't get their money any time soon, if ever,''
said Elizabeth Fink, the principal lawyer for the inmates, who
began to work on the Attica case two weeks after being admitted to
the bar and has continued ever since. ``It would take decades, and
we'd all be dead, so what compensation is that?''
</P>
<P>
   But decades from now, Attica may well be remembered not for the
legal quagmire that it spawned, but for its role as a watershed
event in American history, as a symbol of brute force.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regardless of where you stood on America _ whether you thought
that prisoners were being mistreated or they were dangerously out
of control _ either way, you felt that something was wrong with the
basic institutions in our country after Attica,'' said Rogers M.
Smith, Alfred Cowles Professor of Government at Yale. ``So it
contributed to a mood of cynicism and despair in our country.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 9, 1971, inmates at the Attica Correctional Facility,
about 30 miles east of Buffalo, took several guards hostage and
seized control of parts of the prison.
</P>
<P>
   They demanded things that today seem routine, said Herman
Badillo, then a congressman from the Bronx who was brought in as a
mediator: basic medical care, better food, the right to read
newspapers published by the Black Panthers, the right to have a
Black Muslim minister.
</P>
<P>
   But after several days of negotiations stalled, Gov. Nelson
Rockefeller ordered the retaking of Prison Yard D. So state
troopers stormed the prison, using helicopters, dropping tear gas
and firing indiscriminately in the crowd of 1,281 inmates.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Then, in the hours that followed the initial offensive, prison
guards and law enforcement authorities committed brutal acts of
reprisals against the inmates, including denying basic medical care
to the injured.
</P>
<P>
   In all, 11 guards and 32 prisoners died during the five-day
siege, in what was then the bloodiest one-day encounter between
Americans since just after the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   The aftermath of the assault was messy and passionate.
Government officials distorted the facts, only to be rebuked by
witnesses and medical evidence. The news media got much of the
story wrong, only to add an armor of skepticism.
</P>
<P>
   There were legal pyrotechnics, too. First, government officials
filed kidnapping and other criminal charges against 62 inmates;
those inmates were later granted clemency by Gov. Hugh Carey.
</P>
<P>
   A small group of inmates who had been injured, and their heirs
of some who had been killed, during the initial offensive won $1.3
million in the state's Court of Claims. The widows of some guards
killed during the uprising sued, too, with mixed success.
</P>
<P>
   The class-action suit, meanwhile, took 18 years before coming to
a liability trial, and an additional 5 to reach the damages phase;
the inmates' lawyers and a federal judge later blamed a lower court
judge and the state of New York for the delays.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Smith won a $4 million jury verdict, and David Brosig,
another inmate who had been in the D Yard, $75,000. But a federal
appeals court overturned that verdict in August, ruling that the
trial judge, John Elfvin, had mishandled the trial. So the case was
placed in the hands of Telesca, who vowed to resolve the matter
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, all parties put on their most cordial faces in praising
the judge and assessing the $12 million settlement, which appears
to be the biggest monetary award for a prisoners' rights case, said
John Boston, project director of the Legal Aid Society's Prisoners'
Rights Project in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there was a bittersweet tinge to the atmosphere. The
plaintiffs are all middle-aged or old men now, from 48 to 80.
Prison conditions today, in the current tough-on-crime climate, may
be no better than in 1971. And for the inmates and their lawyers,
there was a sense of disbelief that a life's work was nearing an
end.
</P>
<P>
   ``As in any compromise, this should not and cannot be viewed as
a clear victory for either side,'' Telesca said Tuesday. ``The
continuing recriminations of who's right and who's wrong _ I will
leave that to history.''

FOX'S CHANNEL 10 COULD DISAP PEAR FROM COX CABLE LINEUP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL CLANCY 
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Phoenix) - The X-Files, Ally McBeal and The Simpsons could be
off the air for most Phoenix cable TV subscribers unless Cox
Communications reaches agree ment with Fox Broadcasting over two
new cable channels.
</P>
<P>
   The Fox television network, whose local station is Channel 10
(KSAZ), already has pulled pro gramming from Cox cable systems in
Cleveland, northern Virginia and Texas. Its contract with Cox in
Phoenix expires at midnight Jan. 31, and without an agreement, Fox
will take Chan nel 10 off Cox's system.
</P>
<P>
   As part of its terms for re newal, Fox has demanded that Cox
carry Fox's two new cable channels on the cable company's new
digital service. Cox has refused.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're concerned,'' said Ivan Johnson, Cox's vice president of
public affairs locally. ``Not pessi mistic, but concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   Such a move would affect about 650,000 subscribers in the
Phoenix area.
</P>
<P>
   Some of them already have called Cox and Channel 10 to complain.
Cox routed callers to a recording that suggested they call the TV
station.
</P>
<P>
   Channel 10 has received fewer than 100 calls since some local
Cox subscribers heard about the situation in the other states, said
Kevin Hale, vice president and general manager of the Fox affil
iate.
</P>
<P>
   Subscribers would be forced to disconnect or circumvent the ca
ble service in order to see the programs via Channel 10's
over-the-air broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   Other Fox cable products are not affected.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said Fox wants its new services, FXM for movies and Fox
Sports World, on Cox's digi tal systems nationally. Cox never has
made such an agreement, he said, preferring to negotiate channel
selection locally.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, neither of the new Fox channels has proven itself,
he added.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Tyrer, a Fox spokesman in Los Angeles, said such negotiat
ing tactics are routine for the major networks, each of which has
assorted cable channels. Fox used the same tactic to get its FX
channel on cable systems several years ago, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fox is the only major network to own a station in Phoenix, but
other networks own stations in other large cities.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said he is not aware of any network negotiating in this
fashion, despite the clout of a company like Disney, which owns
ABC, ESPN, the Disney Channel, the Food Network and other cable
channels. But it could hap pen, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why we won't bow to this blackmail,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Hale said he's optimistic that a settlement will be reached.
Tyrer said similar settlements have been made with other major
cable companies and with satel lite TV providers, including Di
recTV, which does business in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the affected Cox sub scribers thus far, about 260,000,
are in northern Virginia, while nearly 90,000 are spread across
Texas and about 72,000 are in Cleveland's western suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   Fox could be counting on the popularity of its NFL playoffs
coverage to make Cox cry uncle; both the Washington Redskins and
Dallas Cowboys are in the playoffs and the affected areas.
</P>
<P>
   New York-based Fox Entertain ment Group, 82 percent owned by
Rupert Murdoch's News Corp., produces TV shows and movies and owns
the Fox net work, several cable channels and 22 TV stations.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta-based Cox is one of the nation's largest cable
companies, with 6 million subscribers. It also owns nearly 25
percent of Dis covery Communications, with its assorted cable
channels, and about 10 percent of the E! Enter tainment Network.

JETS NEWEST LOSING STREAK REACHES 2 COACHES IN 2 DAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Subs for complete writetrhu.)

<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ One day after he was named to succeed Bill
Parcells as the Jets' head coach, Bill Belichick made a sudden
reversal Tuesday and resigned. Belichick informed the team of his
decision only minutes before a news conference intended to
introduce him as the new coach.
</P>
<P>
   It made for a bizarre scene at the Jets' training complex here,
with Belichick delivering a rambling monologue on his decision as
surprised team officials and reporters looked on. On Monday the
Jets had trumpeted his appointment as a sign of stability and
continuity in the wake of Parcells' retirement. Tuesday the team
appeared in disarray, with neither Belichick nor Parcells as coach.
</P>
<P>
   The development at least raised the possibility that Parcells
might return as coach, though he said on Monday that his coaching
career was over. But that was before Belichick made his turnaround.
Parcells was not available for comment Tuesday, and the team's
president, Steve Gutman, declined to speculate on anything about
the future.
</P>
<P>
   The team is up for sale, with two bidders in the running and a
winner expected to be named soon. Belichick cited the uncertainty
over the new ownership and what that might bring as his primary
reason for changing his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't feel at this time I can lead the Jets with a 100
percent conviction,'' he said. ``There are a number of
uncertainties that would affect a head-coaching job _ the new
owner, Bill's future.
</P>
<P>
   ``On Monday Bill said to me, `If you feel that uncertain about
it, maybe you shouldn't really take the job.'''
</P>
<P>
   Belichick, 47, declined to discuss whether he would seek a job
with another team, and in fact he is prevented from doing so by his
contract with the Jets. But the team may have a protracted fight on
its hands over Belichick's status.
</P>
<P>
   Belichick's attorney, Neil Cornrich of Cleveland, notified the
National Football League that Belichick would file a grievance on
Wednesday to void his contract.
</P>
<P>
   Presumably, that would pave the way to his being interviewed by
the New England Patriots, who on Monday dismissed their coach, Pete
Carroll, while at the same time requesting permission to speak to
Belichick about the job. The Jets turned down the request on the
basis that Belichick had succeeded Parcells after Sunday night's
game. The league upheld the Jets' contention that Belichick was off
limits to any other team, and reaffirmed that position in a
statement Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The situation is reminiscent of one three years ago when
Parcells wanted to leave the Patriots to coach the Jets. The NFL
commissioner, Paul J. Tagliabue, had to mediate a settlement
between the Jets and the Patriots to allow Parcells' move, with the
Jets providing draft picks to New England in return.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible, perhaps likely, that Tagliabue will again have
to intercede if the Patriots want to hire Belichick now. The Jets
say they will hold Belichick to his contract, but may end up
negotiating a settlement that would bring them draft choices as
compensation.
</P>
<P>
   Belichick, in a 55-minute discourse in the team's auditorium
Tuesday, said he had felt uneasy with his appointment and had
thought hard about it as he ran on a treadmill at the Jets' complex
late Tuesday morning. So he returned to his office and scribbled
out a resignation that he delivered to Gutman five minutes before
the news conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``Due to the various uncertainties surrounding my position as it
relates to the team's new ownership,'' it started, ``I have decided
to resign as HC of the NY Jets.''
</P>
<P>
   In his comments, Belichick inferred that the contract could be
invalid because the contract was signed with the team's late owner,
Leon Hess, and that there may also have been a change in his status
working under Parcells.
</P>
<P>
   Belichick, the highly regarded defensive coordinator who had a
five-year stint as the Browns' head coach, acknowledged he was
concerned about being in a safe haven as a coach. There was
uncertainty in Cleveland, which lost the franchise to Baltimore
following the 1995 season. He was fired a few months later.
</P>
<P>
   Then he also implied that he did not know what his role would be
under Parcells, a likely Hall of Fame coach and a dominating
figure. Parcells had promised to act as an adviser rather than as
head of the Jets' football operations, which is his title.
</P>
<P>
   Belichick also expressed reservations about the stability of the
club under the new ownership, and pointed out that the process had
gone weeks past what he had been told was the likely sale date.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, just a few minutes before the news conference, Belichick
walked into Parcells' office and notified him he would not take the
job. Belichick then did the same with Gutman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here we go again,'' said the outspoken wide receiver Keyshawn
Johnson, when he learned the news. ``More uncertainty in the
organization. My fourth head coach in four years.'' Actually,
Johnson has had two head coaches, but Belichick would be the third
and his replacement the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   This was actually the second time Belichick had been the Jets'
head coach. In an odd moment in club history, he was the coach for
a week in 1997, while the Jets were maneuvering to bring Parcells
to New York and out of his contract with the Patriots. The Patriots
had refused to allow Parcells to coach the Jets, so the Jets simply
hired Belichick as the interim coach for a year. Parcells would be
functioning as an ``adviser.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Tagliabue ruled that the Jets could sign Parcells for
1997 as head coach, but would have to compensate New England with
draft picks _ third- and fourth-round picks that season, a
second-rounder in 1998 and a first-round pick in 1999. As soon as
that deal was made, Belichick stepped aside and became Parcells'
assistant head coach and defensive coordinator.

U.S. APPEARS TO BE MOVING CLOSER TO RETURNING BOY TO CUBA
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration, eager to end the
troublesome tug of war over Elian Gonzalez, may soon rule that his
father has the right to have the 6-year-old boy returned to him in
Cuba, senior U.S. government officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The process by which Elian would be sent back to Cuba would
begin with the Immigration and Naturalization Service's decision,
probably this week, as to who speaks for the boy, the officials
said. The two contending parties are Elian's father and the
father's relatives in Miami, with whom the boy now lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's our desire to reach a decision on who speaks for the
child on immigration matters as soon as possible,'' said Russ
Bergeron, a spokesman for the immigration service.
</P>
<P>
   Some senior administration officials said, however, that while
there had been no final decision, it was likely that the outcome
would favor the father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, who has already been
interviewed in Cuba by American aides.
</P>
<P>
   Elian was among 13 people who were trying to cross from Cuba to
Florida on a 17-foot aluminum boat when it capsized six weeks ago.
Ten of those on board were killed, including his mother and
stepfather, but Elian survived along with two adults. Having clung
to an inner tube for two days, he was rescued at sea on Nov. 25.
</P>
<P>
   His father's relatives in Miami want him to stay with them for
what they describe as a chance for a better life. But Gonzalez, who
was divorced from Elian's mother, and both sets of grandparents
want him returned to their hometown, Cardenas, a port city east of
Havana.
</P>
<P>
   Tens of thousands of Cubans have protested regularly in Havana
to demand Elian's return, while in Miami anti-Castro groups have
embraced the boy, with visits from local politicians bearing gifts
and encouragement.
</P>
<P>
   The relatives now caring for him have suggested that they might
seek to have the courts award them legal custody, a development
that would certainly complicate the government's efforts to resolve
the case.
</P>
<P>
   Spencer Eig, the lawyer who represents those relatives, has said
he fears that if Elian is sent back to Cuba, he will ``go into the
custody of Fidel Castro for the purposes of being used as a trophy
in parades all around the country as a symbol of Castro's victory
over the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   American officials have been quietly urging that Gonzalez come
to the United States to take Elian back with him. They believe that
the sight of father and son reunited could help defuse some of the
political opposition to the transfer.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department signaled Tuesday that it was prepared to
issue the necessary documents to allow Gonzalez to come to collect
Elian.
</P>
<P>
   ``The State Department is prepared to expedite a nonimmigrant
visa for Mr. Gonzalez if he decides he wants to travel to the
United States to see his son,'' a senior department official said.

THOMAS BUTSON, FORMER TIMES EDITOR, DIES AT 68 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By DOUGLAS MARTIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Thomas G. Butson, a former editor at The New York
Times and other newspapers who went on to become part owner and
editor of The Villager, a community newspaper in Greenwich Village,
died on Monday in Brooklyn. He was 68 and lived in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was pneumonia, his wife, Elizabeth, said.
</P>
<P>
   He began his journalism career at 17 in his native New Zealand
and, by 28, was assistant managing editor of The Toronto Star.
After joining The Times in 1968, he wrote books in his spare time,
including the first English-language biography of Mikhail S.
Gorbachev, which was published on the day Gorbachev assumed power
in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Butson also wrote a biography of Marshal Mikhail N.
Tukhachevsky, Lenin's youngest general in the Bolshevik revolution,
who was killed under Stalin. Called ``The Czar's Lieutenant, the
Soviet Marshal,'' it was published by Praeger in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   He retired from The Times in 1992, three years after receiving a
diagnosis of bone marrow cancer. He and his wife, the former
Elizabeth Margaritas, who was an advertising executive, then bought
The Villager, a money-losing paper that usually had 8 to 12 pages.
Under their ownership, it grew to 32 pages, including an arts
section, and began to show a profit.
</P>
<P>
   Last October, because of Butson's deteriorating health, they
sold The Villager and another Lower Manhattan newspaper, The
Downtown Express, which they bought in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   At The Villager, Butson brought journalistic ambition to a paper
that had previously been more of a shopper. In 1996, he published a
12-page investigative report on the local school board, which his
wife, the publisher and business manager, noted did not exactly
bring in more revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Gordon Butson was born on New Zealand's South Island, to
a farming family. His first job was at The Truth, which he later
described as ``a political scandal sheet.'' He went to England to
find a job on a daily newspaper, but could not, so he emigrated to
Canada, where he worked for a succession of papers, including The
Toronto Star.
</P>
<P>
   He and his wife moved to New York in 1968. He accepted a job at
The Times as an editor of the Week in Review, and moved on to other
Sunday sections, including Arts &AMP; Leisure and Travel. He then
worked as an editor on the foreign desk and on the news desk, which
oversees news selection and presentation.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, Butson is survived by their son, Alex,
of Manhattan, and two sons and a daughter from a previous marriage,
Miles, of Hamilton, Ontario; Thomas Jr., of Montgomery, N.Y., and
Jennifer, of San Francisco.

BELICHICK'S RESIGNATION SHOCKS HIS FATHER 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Among those who were surprised by Bill Belichick's decision to
resign as coach of the Jets was his father, Steve Belichick, a
former assistant football coach at Navy for 33 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just watching it on television and wondering what's
going on,'' the senior Belichick said on Tuesday. ``We were up
there for Christmas and I last talked to him a week ago. My wife
talked to him briefly yesterday. He told her Bill Parcells had
resigned and he was the Jets' new coach. He told her, `I'll talk to
you later,' but later never came. She never got the idea that
things were unsettled.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he said on TV that he had resigned, he said there was an
unsettled situation for him and his family. Bill has always been
concerned about his family. That's been a determining factor about
taking a job. He could have taken jobs in the past in some cities,
but he didn't like the school systems there. His wife was a
schoolteacher, and whenever he was asked about taking a job, she
checked the school system.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has great concern as a father. He realizes he doesn't spend
as much time with his kids as the average father, but when he has
the time that's where he spends it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole thing surprises me. He wanted another shot at a
head job, but he wasn't going to compromise on some things. There
are other jobs. But he loves New York, and when he was with the
Giants he loved it. When he was at New England he loved it. He's an
East Coast guy. I don't have a clue what's going to happen next.'' &QL;

SKIN CELLS BRING CLONING A STEP NEARER TO EFFICIENCY
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By NICHOLAS WADE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The much-heralded era of animal cloning has moved closer to
fruition with a new technique that seems far more efficient than
earlier methods.
</P>
<P>
   With the new cloning technique, four calves, now 7 months to 9
months old, have been cloned from skin cells scraped from the ear
of a prize Japanese bull.
</P>
<P>
   Experts believe that the technique should work in other species,
including humans, giving biologists for the first time the same
general degree of control as they now command in the genetic
engineering of mice.
</P>
<P>
   Previous efforts to clone mammals have been too chancy and
inefficient to be considered practical. Dolly the cloned sheep was
a one-time wonder that her creators have yet to repeat. Researchers
at the University of Hawaii announced in July 1998 that they had
cloned mice, but no other laboratory seems to have repeated their
results.
</P>
<P>
   The new technique has been developed by scientists at the
University of Connecticut in Storrs and the Prefectural Cattle
Breeding Development Institute in Kagoshima, Japan, and is
described in an article that is to appear in the Proceedings of the
National Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   The significance of cloning is that it bypasses the usual
reproductive method in which the genes of the mother and father are
randomly shuffled. By making a new individual from an adult's body
cell, biologists could generate almost identical copies of valued
animals without going through the lottery of natural reproduction.
</P>
<P>
   Human cloning, if ethically acceptable, might also find a useful
niche in assisted-reproduction clinics when other methods do not
work.
</P>
<P>
   But in a commentary on the new research, Dr. Mario Capecchi of
the University of Utah says that he ``would not be particularly
concerned if a very wealthy, eccentric individual desired to
produce a clone of him or herself,'' essentially because he
believes the probable drawbacks of the procedure would give it
little chance of becoming popular. Capecchi developed a major part
of the technique now used for genetically engineering mice.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers took skin cells from a bull's ear and let them
grow for several months in a laboratory dish. They then removed the
nucleus, containing the skin cells' DNA, and injected it into cow
egg cells whose own nucleuses had been removed. The altered eggs
were inserted in the uteri of cows where several developed
successfully to term.
</P>
<P>
   The significance of the new work lies in its practical details.
The researchers, led by Dr. Xiangzhong Yang at Connecticut, worked
with skin cells, which are easy to obtain, in contrast to earlier
efforts that used udder cells or other reproductive tissues.
</P>
<P>
   For many cloning applications, it is desirable to alter the
genes of the cloned embryo before growing it to term. This should
be easy with Yang's technique, because he showed cells could be
kept in laboratory glassware for months before being cloned,
whereas previous cloning efforts have used fresh cells.
</P>
<P>
   Biologists can change any mouse gene they wish by altering the
DNA of mouse embryonic stem cells. These are the all-purpose cells
formed after the fertilized egg's first few divisions and from
which all the tissues of the body develop. The key to the technique
is that mouse embryonic stem cells can be grown in glassware, where
their DNA can be altered before the cell is returned to the embryo.
But in no other mammal has it yet proved possible to culture
embryonic stem cells, with the exception of the human embryonic
stem cells isolated for the first time in November 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Capecchi, who developed the method of making targeted gene
alterations in mouse embryonic stem cells, said Yang's technique
should allow the same genetic targeting to work with other animals,
using ordinary skin cells.
</P>
<P>
   One possible application of the new technique, Capecchi said,
would be to replace an animal's antibody-making genes with the
human antibody genes. Human antibodies can be valuable in treating
diseases, and having them made in bulk by a cow could be a
significant advance.

ACTRESS AND RAPPER AT COURT CREATE A SPECTACLE DOWNTOWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By DAVID ROHDE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The frenzy built steadily outside of Manhattan
Criminal Court Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   The actress Jennifer Lopez and her boyfriend, the rap impresario
Sean Combs, were expected to testify to a grand jury about what
they saw at a Times Square nightclub shooting last month
</P>
<P>
   About 11 a.m., a Lincoln town car with tinted windows rolled
into a parking space outside the private entrance to the Manhattan
district attorney's office. Cameramen and fans pressed forward for
a precious brush with fame.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of an alluring young actress or stylish rap star who
goes by the name Puff Daddy, Robert M. Morgenthau, 80, Manhattan's
district attorney, stepped out. ``Shoot,'' Morgenthau said, eyeing
the crowd around him. ``I meant to wear my dark glasses today.''
</P>
<P>
   Morgenthau's arrival was a momentary diversion from the media
frenzy that has developed since Combs' and Ms. Lopez's brush with
the law. Representatives of every major news organization in the
city, as well as hundreds of fans, spent five hours outside the
district attorney's office Tuesday waiting for the opportunity to
shout greetings or questions at the two stars.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Lopez, who had testified last week and has not been
charged with any crime, was not asked to testify again and left by
a side door. Combs told the grand jury Tuesday that the shooting
occurred as he and Ms. Lopez were leaving the club, a court
official said. Combs said a man shouted at him and a guard advised
him to leave. Shots were then fired behind him, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The frenzy may end or reach a fever pitch Wednesday. The grand
jury is expected to decide Wednesday whether to indict Combs,
according to court officials. At least three witnesses have
testified that Combs did not pull out a gun, the court officials
said, while at least three others have testified that he did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came here just to tell the truth,'' Combs said in a brief
statement to reporters after his testimony. ``I'm confident these
allegations will be shown to be 100 percent false.''
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials confirmed Tuesday that a gun had been
found on Eighth Avenue along the route Combs and Ms. Lopez took
when they sped away from the club after the shooting. During his
testimony, Combs denied that he, Ms. Lopez or anyone else threw a
gun out the car window while the police pursued them, according to
the court officials.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lopez, who was nominated for a Grammy award Tuesday,
testified Thursday that Combs did not pull out a gun that night.
</P>
<P>
   But other fans reveled in the chance to participate in the
celebrity culture. Sundean Reed, 28, a nurse's assistant who took a
6 a.m. train from Waterbury, Conn., to be at the courthouse
Tuesday, volunteered for television interviews and eagerly
described her ``love'' for Combs. ``I think he's innocent,'' she
said earnestly. ``And I think he and Jennifer should stay
together.''

SPORTS COLUMN: COACHING ARROW SPINS RIGHT BACK TO PARCELLS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By THOMAS GEORGE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Three years ago, Bill Belichick was the Jets' head coach for one
week. It was simply a ploy. He held the seat warm until Bill
Parcells could be freed from the New England Patriots and then
Belichick took his customary role as defensive coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Parcells resigned as the Jets' coach and Belichick
took over for what turned out to be one day. There was nothing coy
this time, no type of ploy at work, or so the Jets' management and
players thought.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday, Belichick balked. He resigned before one team
meeting, before one practice as the Jets' head coach. He sees
greener pastures, especially in New England. He wants to be a
free-agent coach. Shop around. Start his own thing, a new thing.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets should oblige.
</P>
<P>
   There is absolutely no way the Jets should try to force
Belichick to coach a team he does not want to coach. Do you think
the players would respond to that?
</P>
<P>
   Here is a coach who for three years has preached to the Jets'
defensive players about loyalty and commitment and excellence. And
now, with a chance to lead them all, he scoots? Do you think the
players are not smart enough to recognize that they have been
indirectly scorned?
</P>
<P>
   For certain, Belichick did not mean for it to be this way. But,
nonetheless, that is the result. The Jets should cut their losses,
take the draft choices as compensation that will truly come their
way by letting Belichick flee, and move forward.
</P>
<P>
   This entire scenario was befuddling from the start.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells leaves New England for the Jets and the Jets are forced
to award draft choices as compensation to New England. Parcells
signs a contract with Leon Hess, then the Jets' owner, which says
Belichick will take over once Parcells quits. Belichick agrees and
reportedly accepts more than $1.4 million to follow through. Hess
dies. The team goes up for sale. Parcells quits. Now, Belichick
quits, too.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets' new ownership is supposed to be in place in a matter
of days. Whoever heard of an owner spending more than $600 million
for a team with a brand-new coach already named? It was absurd from
the start, and now it is even more absurd.
</P>
<P>
   Jets players were stunned Tuesday. For the second time. First
Parcells exits, and a day later, Belichick.
</P>
<P>
   One Jet, who spoke on the condition that his name not be
publicized, said: ``Coach Parcells has always run his own ship and
has no problem voicing his opinion to players, coaches, anybody. He
had his run-ins with Belichick over the defense this year but I
assumed that was nothing out of the ordinary; they've been together
a long time. But it is hard for me to believe that Coach Parcells
could step away from leadership cold turkey and just be some kind
of adviser. I don't think it would have worked with him and
Belichick in that kind of role. I never sensed that Belichick was
unhappy. But you wouldn't know it, anyway, because he doesn't talk
that much.''
</P>
<P>
   Here are the reasons Belichick is a coveted man in the National
Football League: He is a man of extreme and intricate detail. His
game plans are superb. His ability to adjust on the fly during
games is even more impressive.
</P>
<P>
   His drawbacks have always been communication _ especially
mastering the nuances of communication that is required by NFL head
coaches with players, management, reporters and fans. That was one
of the issues that caused his firing from his only NFL
head-coaching job, in Cleveland. But that was almost five years
ago. Since then, Belichick has worked at refurbishing his image.
</P>
<P>
   And it has worked. NFL teams are interested. The Jets were, too.
</P>
<P>
   But Belichick must now be freed by the Jets for a healthy price.
Then the Jets can ask Parcells to return. That is the first choice.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells indicated that if the Jets had not recovered from their
season-opening slide that it would have been harder for him to
retire. They did recover, finishing 8-8 with a 7-2 record in their
last nine games. Now they are in a leadership chaos. If there was
ever a scenario for Parcells to return and keep the ship upright,
this is it.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Henning, now on the Jets' staff as the quarterbacks coach,
could also do the job, as could Romeo Crennel, the defensive line
coach and a longtime Parcells assistant. Mike Martz, the St. Louis
Rams' offensive coordinator, deserves a look as a head coach, too.
And there are several qualified NFL assistants _ Terry Robiskie in
Washington, Dom Capers in Jacksonville, a young, bright mind like
Steve Brown from the Rams _ who could lead the Jets as well.
</P>
<P>
   Fans on Sunday chanted ``One more year!'' for Parcells. Could
he? Would he? Like Belichick, if he really does not want it, he
should not take it.
</P>
<P>
   What, then, do the Jets do if they can't entice Parcells?
Simple: play out the compensation string with Belichick and then
find a new man.

ROBERT J. BURKHARDT, 83, LEADER OF NEW JERSEY DEMOCRATS IN 60S 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Robert James Burkhardt, a onetime power in the New Jersey
Democratic Party who helped organize the Soviet-American summit
meeting at Glassboro, N.J., but stumbled in a bribery scandal, died
on Dec. 30 at Arden Hill Hospital in Goshen, N.Y. A former resident
of Trenton, N.J., and Central Valley, N.Y., he was 83.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was complications from Parkinson's disease, his family
said.
</P>
<P>
   Burkhardt was a highly influential force as executive secretary
to Robert B. Meyner, who was governor of New Jersey from 1954 to
1962, and as Gov. Richard J. Hughes' secretary of state from 1962
to 1970. He was Democratic state chairman for most of the 1960s and
played a major role in planning the meeting between President
Lyndon B. Johnson and the Soviet leader, Alexei N. Kosygin, at
Glassboro State College in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   A native of Chicago, he attended Purdue University and did
engineering work before turning to politics in New York and then
New Jersey. He headed the New York State Young Democrats in 1949
and after that became an increasingly important figure in state and
national election campaigns, starting with Adlai E. Stevenson's
campaign committee in 1952.
</P>
<P>
   He was a delegate to every Democratic National Convention from
1956 to 1968 and helped organize the one in Atlantic City, N.J., in
1964. He also served twice each as gubernatorial campaign director
for Meyner and Hughes.
</P>
<P>
   Burkhardt's political career ended in a guilty plea in federal
court in 1972 to a charge of accepting $30,000 in bribes in 1964
while Hughes' secretary of state and close adviser. The case
against him involved a bridge construction contract, and he was
given a suspended sentence and three years' probation.
</P>
<P>
   Burkhardt's wife, Lucille Hogan Burkhardt, died in 1995 after 58
years of marriage. He is survived by two daughters, Robin Burkhardt
of Central Valley, and Valerie Merier of Kennebunkport, Maine; two
sons, Robert Jr. of Estes Park, Colo., and Ross of Las Cruces,
N.M.; and six grandchildren.

BANK ACCOUNT TO REMAIN FROZEN OF LOTTERY WINNER WHO WASN'T
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By KATHERINE E. FINKELSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Susan Madakor was hoping for a free lunch but got
frozen assets instead, when a judge in Manhattan ruled Tuesday that
she could not spend the remainder of $700,000 that was accidentally
transferred into her bank account.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Madakor, a single mother in Brooklyn, was a receptionist at
a Manhattan textile firm, eking out a living and wading through
credit card debt, until a bizarre windfall in 1998 led her to make
grand plans.
</P>
<P>
   Claiming that she believed she had won an international lottery
that deposited hundreds of thousands of dollars directly into her
account, Ms. Madakor bought a laundry business for $100,000, set up
a college fund for her 10-year-old son, paid off $30,000 in credit
card debt, furnished a new apartment, leased a minivan and began
negotiating to buy a liquor store.
</P>
<P>
   The only problem was, the money did not come from a lottery. It
was to have been deposited in a U.N. account for a fund that
rescues endangered plants and animals, but landed in Ms. Madakor's
account at Chase Manhattan Bank instead. Her account number varied
from the U.N. fund's account by one digit.
</P>
<P>
   Now her windfall _ the $701,998 that came in 13 wire transfers
from more than six countries _ is the object of a remarkable
international tussle involving the United Nations, Chase Manhattan,
and Ms. Madakor.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Justice Barry Cozier of state Supreme Court in
Manhattan rejected a request by Ms. Madakor's lawyer to unfreeze
the assets, which she had come to rely on. Instead, Cozier said the
case represented ``unjust enrichment'' and that Ms. Madakor had
evidence that she was not the legitimate owner of the funds.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for Chase Manhattan and the United Nations expressed
relief over the decision, but the ultimate question of what will
happen to the remaining $450,000 and the money Ms. Madakor has
already spent remains unanswered. ``We regret that Ms. Madakor has
taken the unusual position of suing us for money that isn't hers,''
said Ken Herz, a Chase Manhattan Bank spokesman. When the United
Nations discovered the misplaced money it notified Chase Manhattan,
which froze Ms. Madakor's account.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations sounded a similar note Tuesday. ``As far as
we're concerned, the money was intended for the protection of plant
and animal species,'' said Fred Eckhard, a U.N. spokesman. ``It
wasn't intended to buy a laundromat.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Madakor's lawyer, Michael Siegel, said that his client
thought she had won an international lottery and was overwhelmed by
the experience, as well as the devastating aftermath of her plans
falling to pieces. ``It would be like someone sold you the Brooklyn
Bridge, then you look in the records and it was deeded to you, then
Chase gives her a private banker, obviously ratifying her
experience on a daily basis,'' said Siegel.
</P>
<P>
   It remained unclear on Tuesday who was to blame for the
erroneous transfers. Herz of Chase Manhattan refused to comment on
it, while Ms. Madakor's lawyer and a U.N. spokesman said it was
still being investigated.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations said that it would take all necessary legal
action to recover the money.

HAIR TO TRAVEL DESPITE FLU BUG
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC freshman guard Nate Hair was briefly
hospitalized Tuesday after experiencing severe effects from the
flu, but will accompany the Trojans when they leave for Washington
today.
</P>
<P>
   Hair said he was connected to an IV for two hours, after being
up most of the night from nausea and vomiting.
</P>
<P>
   Although USC coach Henry Bibby said he was unsure if Hair would
make the trip, Hair said he had been cleared to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I threw up like four or five times,'' Hair said. ``But I think
I'll be OK. The doctor said it was all right to go and play.''
</P>
<P>
   Hair has emerged as USC's sixth man, averaging 12 minutes per
contest, including 18 last week against Northwestern.
</P>
<P>
   Homecourt advantage? USC has not swept the Washington schools on
the road since 1985, but the Trojans will not face either team on
its homecourt this week.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans play Washington State in Spokane, which is about 80
miles away from Pullman. They then get to play Washington in
KeyArena, because the Huskies are renovating Hec Edmundson
Pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   Bibby liked the idea of both Washington schools playing outside
their normal environment, and compared it to the Trojans playing in
the Sports Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it evens it out a little bit, I like that,'' Bibby
said. ``They're playing away from home too. We're a little more
accustomed to that because of where we have to practice (on
campus). We're kind of a little more at home than they are in that
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Nice touch: Forward Brian Scalabrine is leading the Trojans from
3-point range, shooting 52 percent this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not shooting that many. That's why,'' Scalabrine said. ``I
don't shoot bad shots. I take wide, wide, wide open shots.''
</P>
<P>
   Scalabrine has made 15 of 29 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, Bibby said point guard Brandon Granville's
low-shooting percentage (33 percent) is explained by his propensity
for 3-point shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't get a lot of easy baskets,'' Bibby said. ``Brandon
has it tough. That's what happens when you jump shots a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Seventy two of Granville's 118 shots have been 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   Strong support: Scalabrine, who grew up in Enumclaw, a small
town outside Seattle, said he will have a large crowd at Saturday's
game in KeyArena against the Huskies.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mom bought 50 tickets for her whole company to go,''
Scalabrine said.
</P>
<P>
   Poll results: Bibby said he asked his team how they would fare
once Pac-10 play begins, and not surprisingly, got an enthusiastic
response.
</P>
<P>
   ``They think they can win a lot of games,'' Bibby said. ``We
didn't have say we would go 17-1, but we had some guys that were
very optimistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Iron men: Scalabrine said he wasn't surprised Bibby barely
played his bench in last week's 41-point blowout of Northwestern.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Coach Bibby's thinking is to have us ready to play the
whole game,'' Scalabrine said. ``The only way to get in game shape
is to play the whole game. I don't think he projects to win 30 or
40 points every night.''
</P>
<P>
   Services set: Funeral services will be held Thursday for Barbara
Williams, the administrative assistant for the USCwomen's
basketball team for the past eight years, and the sister of Chicago
White Sox Manager Jerry Manuel.
</P>
<P>
   The funeral service will be held Thursday at 2 p.m. at the
Angelus Funeral Home, 3875 South Crenshaw Blvd., Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, 49, died last Thursday after suffering a brain
aneurism.

AT HOME, EVEN IF ONLY FROM AFAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I have three business trips looming in the next five weeks. In
addition to the usual arrangements _ plane reservations, hotel
reservations, car rental, driving directions _ I find myself
worrying about one thing more: Will there be access to a fax
machine at about 5 o'clock Eastern Standard Time, so my third
grader can fax me his homework?
</P>
<P>
   There's a trend at our house when it comes to business travel.
When my husband (who's a doctor) does it, someone back home always
gets sick. Bruce was in Vienna when our older son was ordered to
spend an immobile weekend on the couch because of an inflammation
of his hip, and he was in San Jose, Calif., when that same son
spent another weekend on the same couch because of a broken leg, so
there was a lot of consulting and consoling done long distance.
</P>
<P>
   When I travel, the glitches (knock wood) have been more mundane.
I've scheduled play dates from a street corner in Denver and hired
a roofer from a hotel room in Louisville, Ky. One night, when my
plane was very late and my children very young, I sang them a
lullaby from the Atlanta airport. It was the Barney song, and it
made the women at the phones on either side of me start to cry. It
might have been my voice, but I prefer to think it was the
universal tug of a fretful child who is far away.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving the house doesn't mean you leave the house behind. And
now that the boys are older, their needs go beyond simple
lullabies, which is why we've hit upon the homework plan. My son
will fax his worksheets to me, I will fax my suggestions back,
he'll send revisions and I'll fax or phone him my praise. And
somehow I'll also manage to fit in the meetings I came for in the
first place. (Let me pre-empt your letters here. Yes, Bruce could
check the work when he gets home, but by that late hour my son is
so tired that the exercise would be torture for everyone.)
</P>
<P>
   If I dared to suggest that all this technology is a mixed
blessing _ we (italics)can(end italics) be in touch, ergo we feel
we (italics)must(end italics) _ my mother would probably remind me
of the night she was born. She arrived a month ahead of schedule
and my grandfather was 3,000 miles away on a business trip. My
grandmother sent him a telegram, which he didn't get until the next
morning. He boarded a train and, nearly a week later, he was home.
</P>
<P>
   I say my mother would (italics)probably(end italics) remind me
of this story, because I can't ask her right now. She's in South
America. Her work as an expert in international insurance law keeps
her out of the country as often as she is in it, and she revels in
the technology that allows her to run her home without actually
being there. She has called from an airplane to wish me a happy
birthday, and from a cruise ship to test her new cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, she called from the southernmost tip of Chile, asking
me to go throw out the expired milk carton in her fridge. (Just for
the record, she never traveled for work while I was growing up _
she was home every night to check (italics)my(end italics) homework
_ which is probably the reason for her present euphoria and my
parallel level of guilt.)
</P>
<P>
   My children joke that grandma and grandpa should just give up
the house and live out of a suitcase, but even that doesn't free
you from the long-distance details. Bello Nock, the star clown of
the Big Apple Circus, lives out of a custom double-wide trailer,
and his biggest stress, he says, is paying the bills. Or, more
precisely, (italics)finding(end italics) the bills, which is no
simple task when you play 11 cities each year. His credit card
statements are mailed to his ``home'' address in Florida, then
forwarded to the circus' main office in New York, which sends
overnight to wherever he happens to be. By the time they arrive
they are often overdue, but when he calls and explains that he is a
circus clown, he is usually forgiven.
</P>
<P>
   Forgiveness, however, is not always so easily won. Scott Kelly,
the pilot on the space shuttle crew that just repaired the Hubble
telescope, learned this when telling his young daughter that daddy
would be in outer space on Christmas Day. To ease the blow, Lt.
Cmdr. Kelly promised he would aim the $2 billion piece of equipment
at the North Pole just for her, and peer in on Santa Claus.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't do it, of course, but it's the thought that counts _
the need to be home even when (especially when) you can't. Will it
be a giant leap forward or backward for mankind, I wonder, when
astronauts start checking math homework, singing lullabies and
paying their Visa bills while (far) away at work?

LOS ANGELES INVESTORS REACT TO WALL STREET
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY CHRIS SIEROTY 
c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Analysts and investors alike say they are
cautiously optimistic about Wall Street's future despite Tuesday's
carnage, when stocks were battered on fears the Federal Reserve
would fight inflation with a series of interest rate increases in
the coming year.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve Open Market Committee is scheduled to meet
Feb. 1 and 2, at which time Fed watchers expect the committee to
raise overnight rates by at least a quarter point. The Fed left
rates unchanged at 5.5 percent after its last meeting on Dec. 21.
</P>
<P>
   Those interest rate fears and some old-fashioned profit-taking
dropped the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index down 229.41
points, or 5.5 percent, to 3,901.74, its largest one-day point
decline ever. On Monday the Nasdaq closed at a record high of
4,131.15.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average fell 359.58 points, or 3.17
percent, to 10,997.93. It was the fourth-largest point loss in
market history and the first time the Dow had closed below 11,000
since Dec. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Canello, an investment strategist with Morgan Stanley/Dean
Witter in New York, said along with interest rate worries,
investors are also concerned about rising bond yields.
</P>
<P>
   The yield on the 30-year bond Tuesday was 6.530 percent, making
it an attractive, relatively worry-free option for investors.
</P>
<P>
   Canello said high bond rates combined with the possibility of an
interest rate increase, make it a good time for people to take
profits in some stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``My advice to the average investor,'' Canello said, ``would be
to sit tight with all the old economy stocks. Do lock in some
profits in new economy stocks, including the Internet, technology
and telecommunications.''
</P>
<P>
   Suburban Winnetka resident Timothy Shearin, an investor since
1993, said investors had a myriad of reasons for selling on
Tuesday. The bond yield has become an attractive investment, ``and
with Y2K turning out to be a nonissue, investors are worried about
an interest rate hike when the Federal Reserve meets next month.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Shearin said, many investors waited until the new
year to sell high-flying stocks so they won't have to pay capital
gains taxes on the profits until April 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Strauss, a dentist in suburban Panorama City, said he
wasn't worried about Tuesday's sell-off on Wall Street. ``I'm going
to ride this out for a couple of days, and see what certain stocks,
including General Electric and Novell, are doing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Curt Bawden of Agua Dulce north of Los Angeles said that even
with Tuesday's decline, he's going to continue to buy stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would move into safe, large cap stocks like Disney, because
they are the ones that can retain their volume,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant Riley, president of Santa Monica-based B. Riley &AMP; Co.,
wasn't worried about Tuesday's drop. In fact, he had been looking
forward to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sell-off was long overdue,'' he said. ``These things
usually take a couple of days to wash out. The market needed to
take a break. It couldn't continue to go straight up forever.''

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The governing board of the National Association of
Securities Dealers gave its unanimous approval Tuesday to a
sweeping reorganization plan to sell more than 75 percent of the
association's stake in the Nasdaq stock market. The plan, to be
carried out in two steps through a private placement, is expected
to raise roughly $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The association aims to create a freestanding Nasdaq market that
would be accountable to its own shareholders rather than to NASD's
disparate and often contentious membership. In fact, the original
plan had to be modified to satisfy the thousands of small member
firms that feared they would be outvoted by their giant rivals.
</P>
<P>
   While potentially profitable for NASD members and market makers,
the ownership change will also give investors and corporate issuers
the benefits of a ``more agile, better-capitalized Nasdaq,'' said
Frank G. Zarb, the association's chairman and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last year, Zarb has argued that an ownership change is
essential for the Nasdaq market, which like other established
marketplaces is facing increased competition from fast new
computerized trading networks called ECNs. Similar steps have been
taken by a number of major stock exchanges abroad and are being
considered by the New York Stock Exchange and at least three other
regional stock exchanges in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The NASD plan, which still faces a vote by association members
and the scrutiny of the Securities and Exchange Commission, stops
short of calling for a public offering of Nasdaq shares, as Zarb
has envisioned. He said Tuesday that the final decision on whether
to undertake an initial public offering would be left to the board
that is elected by the new Nasdaq shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Zarb said he expected members would be asked to vote by the end
of March, clearing the way for the first private placement almost
immediately. The second sale could occur by midyear, he said.
Salomon Smith Barney would handle both transactions.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal calls for half of the $1 billion raised through the
private placement to be earmarked for the association's regulatory
agency, called NASDR, which would remain a subsidiary of the parent
nonprofit association.
</P>
<P>
   According to Zarb, the association expects that the newly
independent Nasdaq market would hire NASDR to police its trading
practices, thereby generating additional revenue to support the
work of the regulatory unit.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Arthur Levitt, the SEC chairman, noted Tuesday
that Levitt has said on numerous occasions that the regulatory work
required of all stock exchanges must be adequately funded as those
markets evolve. But he declined to comment on whether the NASD
proposal adequately addresses those concerns.
</P>
<P>
   About $215 million from the private placement is to be invested
in the American Stock Exchange, a traditional auction-style stock
exchange that the NASD also owns. Roughly $114 million would be
used over the next seven years to reduce the association's
membership fees. The remainder, officials said, would likely be
invested in the Nasdaq market, where some of America's hottest
technology companies are listed.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the two-step reorganization, NASD's stake in the
Nasdaq market would be reduced to roughly 22 percent, with the rest
of the shares held by four groups: major Nasdaq market makers like
Merrill Lynch; up to 130 Nasdaq-listed corporations, including
Microsoft and Intel; a select group of institutional investors,
like Fidelity Investments, which are not NASD members, and finally,
the thousands of small broker-dealers who make up the bulk of the
association's membership.
</P>
<P>
   The first phase of the plan calls for 47 to 49 percent of the
association's stake in Nasdaq to be sold to those groups, with the
association retaining control over the market.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the Nasdaq market would apply to the SEC for approval as a
freestanding stock exchange. After gaining approval, an additional
30 percent of the association's Nasdaq stake would be sold to the
same groups, reducing the association to a minority stockholder.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, the plan calls for Nasdaq to offer newly issued
shares to its new investors, while NASD sells them warrants that
entitle them to purchase the existing Nasdaq shares that the
association owns. According to Zarb, the transaction will be
structured to preserve NASD's tax-exempt status and avoid punitive
tax consequences to its members, although a tax ruling has not yet
been received.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the two-stage private placement, 30 to 32 percent of
the new Nasdaq shares would be offered to roughly 130 ``strategic
market participants'' _ those big market makers that generate the
bulk of Nasdaq's trading revenues. Another 16.5 percent of the
market's equity would be offered to Nasdaq issuers, including
giants like Microsoft and Intel.
</P>
<P>
   The association's members, 5,575 broker-dealers, would be
allowed to buy 25 percent of the Nasdaq shares and would have the
right to purchase 8 percent more of the equity if shares are ever
offered to the public.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, at the point of any initial public offering, the small
brokerage firms that make up most of the association's membership
would control about the same number of shares as the big market
makers.
</P>
<P>
   That arrangement was strongly endorsed by Alan L. Davidson,
president of Zeus Securities, who has been fighting for the
interests of the smaller NASD members during the yearlong
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   While he had not gotten ``a hundred percent of what I wanted,''
Davidson said Tuesday, ``what I got was fair treatment and
reasonableness.'' He said he anticipated that the proposal of the
governing board would get strong support among the membership when
it is submitted to a vote in late March.

JAILED EX-CHIEF OF UNITED WAY OWED $4.2 MILLION 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ United Way of America owes its imprisoned former
president, William Aramony, the full $4.2 million in his deferred
compensation plan because the plan did not include a clause
forfeiting the money if Aramony committed a felony, a federal judge
ruled Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Shira Scheindlin of U.S. District Court in Manhattan
ruled, however, that United Way can withhold $2.02 million in
salary, investigative costs and interest that Aramony owes the
organization that he ran for 19 years. She also ruled that Aramony
is not entitled to legal fees due the lawyer who won the case,
Dennis Houdek of Flacone, Houdek &AMP; Curd in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling Tuesday focused on a tax law issue that could have
reduced the award by $1.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, United Way directors approved a ``top hat'' pension
plan for Aramony in addition to his standard pension. The term top
hat derives from the fact that only executives and other highly
paid workers can have such benefits on top of the basic pension
plan that all workers in an organization may earn.
</P>
<P>
   When the top hat plan was approved, a judge found in an earlier
proceeding that Aramony and a second executive, Steve Paulacheck,
were already stealing from the charity. Both men were convicted on
federal fraud and embezzling charges after the thefts were
disclosed by The Washington Post in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The thefts prompted a sharp drop in gifts to local United Ways,
which funnels most of their money to youth, social services and
health charities.
</P>
<P>
   The draft of the top hat plan shown to the board included a
``bad boy'' clause that denied the top hat money to the executive
if he committed a felony.
</P>
<P>
   The board authorized Mutual of America, a New York insurance and
pension plan company with close ties to the United Way movement, to
draw up the top hat plan and it authorized Paulacheck to sign on
behalf of United Way of America directors. But somehow the ``bad
boy'' clause never made its way into the final contract.
</P>
<P>
   Scheindlin ruled earlier that United Way of America produced no
evidence of collusion in the disappearance of the ``bad
boy''language and so its disappearance would not be construed to
damage Aramony's claim.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Amundsen, chief administrative officer of United Way of
America, sent an e-mail memo to all 1,300 local United Ways on
Tuesday night announcing that it ``is disappointed with the court's
ruling and disagrees'' with the reasoning used to ``conclude that
Mr. Aramony is entitled'' to money in the top hat plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are reviewing with outside counsel to determine if there is
any reasonable basis for appeal,'' Amundsen wrote. ``In any event,
sufficient funds have been set aside and are available to satisfy
the judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   Anthony De Cristofaro, a United Way of America spokesman, said
lawyers would also be consulted about whether to sue Mutual of
America. He said talks with Mutual of America began in November.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Moran, president and chief executive of Mutual of
America, said Tuesday night that he was unaware of any such talks.
</P>
<P>
   Moran declined to comment on whether Mutual of America had erred
in preparing the documents beyond saying that the judge had upheld
the contract and found that it was in line with the board's
understanding of its contents.
</P>
<P>
   United Way of America officials insist that the signed contract
did not accurately reflect the board's intent.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to reach Aramony's son, Bob, were unsuccessful Tuesday
night. Houdek, Aramony's civil lawyer, said he felt ``absolutely
terrific'' about the ruling.

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: A New Year's baby for the new
century
 &HT;    (Eds: Fixes dropped words in 4th graf.)
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUFKIN, Texas _ My wife and I stayed home New Year's Eve,
watching on TV the celebrations around the world. By the time we
went to bed, midnight in Texas thereabouts, I was deeply regretful
that we had not gone somewhere and done something extra special _
to New Zealand or to Paris _ as some of our friends had.
</P>
<P>
   That was then. Two hours later, everything changed.
</P>
<P>
   The phone rang, waking me from my deeply regretful sleep. I
fumbled to answer it. My daughter Kate was on the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me speak to Mother,'' she said, evenly.
</P>
<P>
   Something was wrong. I knew that much instantly, and I wanted to
hear it firsthand from her. I always expect the worst, maybe that
the dam broke. I wasn't that far off.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is it?'' I demanded.
</P>
<P>
   ``My water broke,'' she said, evenly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here, talk to your mother,'' I said, and handed off the phone.
</P>
<P>
   It was a heck of a deal. She's our youngest, 25. The baby wasn't
due for three weeks. Her husband, Keith, was in the hospital where
they live, Waco, with pneumonia, hooked up to IVs and oxygen.
</P>
<P>
   She had a touch of pneumonia herself but not so bad that she
needed to be hospitalized. She was staying there with him in the
room. During the night she got to coughing so hard that it got the
baby's attention.
</P>
<P>
   My wife talked quietly to my daughter for a minute or two while
I occupied myself by running around in circles as if one foot were
nailed to the floor. Then she hung up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's go back to sleep,'' she said. ``Nothing's going to
happen for a while. We can get up in the morning and drive over.''
</P>
<P>
   Which was the sensible thing to do. Never mind I was already
halfway dressed. Lucky for me I don't have a willy-nilly wife or
willy-nilly daughters. I'm willy-nilly enough for all of us.
</P>
<P>
   We drove the three hours to Waco the next morning, arriving in
plenty of time. The baby arrived 1 1/2 hours later, William Joseph,
named for the two grandfathers, and born on the afternoon of the
first day of the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The father managed to be on hand as well, garbed in mask and
gown and protective gloves to keep from spreading pneumonia germs,
shuffling to the delivery room accompanied by a rolling IV pole.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody is just fine, thank you.
</P>
<P>
   Keith's mother and grandmother were there, too, just in time.
His mother, all the way from Lubbock in far West Texas, had come
directly after what she described as a hysterical call from him.
He's a boy after my own heart.
</P>
<P>
   They stayed to help with the baby. We came on back home. Next
week it'll be our turn to stay.
</P>
<P>
   By the time we went to bed, early even for us, I was deeply
thankful we had stayed home for New Year's Eve. Whatever the
celebrations worldwide, none could have compared to ours.

HISPANIC LABORERS WELCOMED AT WORK, BUT SHUNNED AT HOME IN
SUBURBS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)

   MOUNT KISCO, N.Y. _ Gladys and Pedro Rueda are treated
respectfully in the palatial houses they clean throughout northern
Westchester and Fairfield Counties, with generous tips during the
holiday season, offers of stylish hand-me-downs and compliments for
their reliability and hard work.
</P>
<P>
   But here in the Westchester County town where they've lived for
11 years, started a business, learned halting English and taken
leadership responsibilities at church, a simple trip to the store
can be an occasion for humiliation, as it was recently when Mrs.
Rueda went shopping for a cellular telephone.
</P>
<P>
   ``The man looked me up and down,'' she said of the store owner.
``He said: `You need a lot of money. Do you have money?' Why was he
asking those questions?''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Rueda, a Peruvian, knew the answer. She is a Hispanic
immigrant, one of about 140,000 in Westchester County, who make the
good life possible by doing the jobs nobody else wants to do. And
the differences between her life at work and her life at home
reflect one of the newest quandaries of suburbia: while Hispanic
immigrants have become an essential part of the economy in these
wealthy precincts, they have yet to be fully embraced by their
neighbors and do not blend in as they would in the melting pot of
New York City to the south.
</P>
<P>
   There are some food banks, community centers and literacy
programs to meet the needs of the suburban immigrants. And some
residents welcome the diversity as a counterweight to the
homogeneity of the overwhelmingly white northern suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   But the efforts to accommodate the immigrants have not kept pace
with their growth. In addition, there is very little affordable
housing in northern Westchester and few efforts to bridge the
cultural gap between the poor immigrants and the affluent whites
who surround them.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the cultural and economic issues tend to play out
conspicuously in the few mixed communities like this town of 9,100
people, where the Hispanic population increased by 195 percent, to
1,180 from 401, between 1980 and 1990 and has continued to grow
since then. By contrast, neighboring towns like Katonah, Pound
Ridge and Bedford see the immigrants only as workers, not as
residents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want them to be invisible,'' said Luis H. Zayas, a
professor of social work at Fordham University and director of its
Center for Hispanic Mental Health Research. ``We don't want to look
at them except as laborers. During the day they can be in our
streets, but we don't want to see them at night or on Saturday.''
</P>
<P>
   Most problematic to many who live in Mount Kisco are the single
men, mostly from one Guatemalan province, who far outnumber
immigrant women or families. Each morning, they congregate near the
railroad station waiting to be picked up for jobs in landscaping or
construction.
</P>
<P>
   At night, they congregate outdoors as they would in a Central
American village. To some of their neighbors, the mere presence of
the immigrants can feel threatening, even when their behavior is
beyond reproach. And a minority are drunk and surly, making
suggestive remarks to women or urinating on the street.
</P>
<P>
   In Mount Kisco, the discrimination has become more subtle and
less pervasive than even in the mid-'90s, when white residents
wrote blatantly racist letters to the local weekly newspaper. But
the immigrants say they still get a wide berth when they gather on
street corners to socialize. The neighborhoods where they live have
seen gradual white flight. And advocates for the immigrants say
they often hear remarks like, ``I bought a half-million house up
here to get away from people like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the immigrant men living in Mount Kisco said their
neighbors grow more welcoming if they speak English, hold steady
jobs and have spouses and children. But Edgar Chacon, a Guatemalan
who has progressed from a dishwasher to a landscaper to a financial
analyst at Citibank in 13 years _ and now has a wife and children _
said acceptance was still based on appearance, not accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I wear my name tag from work in the street, I'm treated
with respect,'' he said. ``If I dress casual, they treat me like
garbage.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The increase in the Hispanic population in Westchester County
has been dramatic _ almost 90 percent during the 1980s, when the
rest of the county's population grew by just 1 percent. In the 1990
census, Hispanics represented 10 percent of the county's
population, at 86,194. The county's planning department projects
that the 2000 census will show an increase to 16 percent and
another jump to 24 percent by 2020. Census figures generally do not
include undocumented immigrants and thus significantly understate
the Hispanic population.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth T. Jackson, a Columbia University historian and author
of ``Crabgrass Frontier,'' a critique of suburbia, calls the
concentration of laborers in one town ``a basic unfairness.'' He
knows this firsthand because he owns a home in Chappaqua, where his
wife is a school teacher. There his lawn is cared for by a crew of
Central Americans whom he does not know and rarely sees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our lifestyle benefits from the sweat of people we don't want
to legitimize or honor,'' Jackson said. ``If everybody benefits, 50
of them should live in every town.''

 &HT;    HMO suffers huge verdict after insured denied coverage
 &HT;    By Susan Spencer-Wendel
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The court clerk had to pause to count
the zeroes before reading the $78.5 million verdict Tuesday
punishing HMO giant Humana for cutting back coverage on a little
girl with cerebral palsy.
</P>
<P>
   Jurors awarded Mark Chipps and his 9-year-old daughter Caitlyn
an additional $1.1 million to compensate them for medical costs,
pain and emotional suffering. But the whopping amount _ believed to
be one of the largest awards of its kind in the nation _ they
specifically designated to punish Humana.
</P>
<P>
   The Kentucky-based corporation removed the little girl who wears
leg braces from a special insurance plan which paid for therapy to
help her walk and talk. The Chipps' attorneys argued that the
family chose Humana because it promised to pay for those services,
but then took them off the plan.
</P>
<P>
   The Chipps asked for $100 million, and the jury almost obliged.
``It's not about just one family. It's a case about Humana's
conduct toward many people they insure,'' said juror Joe Knight of
Boynton Beach, Fla. ``We wanted to send a message.''
</P>
<P>
   Humana essentially lost the case last March when Circuit Judge
James Carlisle made a default judgment against the company for
failing to produce documents on time. Carlisle said then that
Humana showed reckless disregard when it deliberately severed the
Loxahatchee girl's coverage, but a jury was left to decide just how
much the HMO giant should pay.
</P>
<P>
   Jurors heard almost three weeks of testimony, then took two days
to deliberate.
</P>
<P>
   Knight said one Humana executive who testified ``dripped with
arrogance.'' Another witness said the executive had once compared
taking patients off the special plans to feeding dogs steak, then
switching to hamburger.
</P>
<P>
   Knight said that was a real blow to the company's defense.
</P>
<P>
   The award was an average of the amount each of the three men and
three women wanted, Knight said. Some in the group suggested
awarding about $100 million in punitive damages.
</P>
<P>
   Diane Leininger was one of them. While the jurors do not want to
be accused of being excessive, they also knew that they needed a
whopping figure to make an impression, she said. ``We knew the only
way to punish the company was with a lot of money,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Pam Gadinsky, a Humana spokeswoman, said the company will
vigorously appeal the ``runaway verdict.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not a case of poor care . . . there was no harm done to
her,'' Gadinsky said. ``The only thing this runaway verdict does is
increase costs for consumers and incomes for trial lawyers.''
</P>
<P>
   The insurance bureau chief for one of the largest American
consumer groups in America, though, disagrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big verdicts are good. That way you get the attention of the
HMO's who, in my view, have gotten away with murder for a long
time,'' said Bob Hunter, former insurance commissioner of Texas now
working at the Consumer Federation of America in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Public backlash against HMOs cutting off care is at an all-time
high, Hunter said, and awards like Tuesday's are beginning to crop
up around the nation.
</P>
<P>
   But the chance of the Chipps and their lawyers _ Ted Leopold and
Edward Ricci _ actually receiving the full amount of $79.6 million
dollars is slim.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every verdict like that loses something on the appeal or in a
settlement,'' Hunter said. ``They'll never get it.''
</P>
<P>
   Chipps, a Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office employee, received
the insurance through work. In 1994, the sheriff's office switched
insurance plans and let employees choose between Humana and another
health insurer. Chipps chose Humana because it offered to pay for
the same special care that his previous insurer had provided.
</P>
<P>
   Gadinsky said Humana voluntarily placed Caitlyn in an upgraded
plan which covered things like speech and physical therapy, then
moved her back to their standard plan coverage _ which didn't cover
them _ after her doctors determined she had progressed and no
longer qualified for the extra coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Caitlyn regressed, losing her balance and walking into walls.
After 10 months, Humana returned her to the special plan after the
Chipps family hired a lawyer. Eventually, the sheriff's office
changed plans again.
</P>
<P>
   Chipps sued Humana in 1997, claiming the company's decision to
drop Caitlyn from the special plan was based on financial reasons,
not medical ones.
</P>
<P>
   Leopold is also one of the attorneys behind a nationwide
class-action lawsuit filed in October against Humana. It claims the
insurance company committed fraud because it didn't tell customers
that coverage levels are tied to costs.
</P>
<P>
   The largest verdict ever _ $120.5 million _ against a
managed-care company came in January 1999 against Aetna U.S.
Healthcare in California. The widow of a man who died of stomach
cancer sued after a health plan denied a treatment his doctor
requested.
</P>
<P>
   Leopold said the mega-verdicts against the companies are
justified.
</P>
<P>
   ``The companies had no conscience . . . but we had a jury strong
enough to say never do this again,'' he said.

IF PLATO RAN HIS IN-LAW'S INSURANCE COMPANY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio, N.C.)   (bl)  
 By ABBY ELLIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Shortly after Lauren Patch took over his father-in-law's
Cincinnati insurance business, Ohio Casualty, eight years ago, he
made a decision: He would resist overtures from larger insurers to
buy the company.
</P>
<P>
   It was a risky course in an industry where the giants have a
history of absorbing or crushing smaller rivals. So Patch sought
outside advice. But not from an ordinary business consultant. No,
Patch hired Dr. Tom Morris, a professional philosopher, to impart
to him the wisdom of the ages. And, by carefully studying the
admonitions of such seers as Aristotle, Plato, Seneca and
Machiavelli, and applying them to the management of his company, he
says, it has flourished.
</P>
<P>
   ``The insurance business has been unprofitable, but within those
things that a manager can control _ like employee and customer
attitudes _ things have gotten better,'' Patch said. ``If your
employees wear anxieties on their sleeves as management changes,
those affect customer attitudes. As we went forward and followed a
lot of things the philosophers said, people have begun to
understand and trust us. Customers feel much better about the
relationship, and as that satisfaction improves so does our
success.''
</P>
<P>
   Philosophical counseling, though still in its infancy, seems to
be catching on. Morris' book, ``If Aristotle Ran General Motors:
The New Soul of Business'' (Henry Holt &AMP; Co., 1997) has sold about
75,000 hardcover copies in two years. And the number of
philosophical practitioners has grown sharply from just a handful
five years ago, in part as the result of lobbying by Dr. Lou
Marinoff, a philosophy professor at City College of New York and
the author of ``Plato Not Prozac!: Applying Philosophy to Everyday
Problems'' (HarperCollins, 1999). Membership in the American
Philosophical Practitioners Association, which he began in April,
has grown to more than 175 since then, he said, and so far 50 of
them have been certified to practice as counselors and consultants
in 14 states and several foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``The theory of Socratic dialogue is to keep your mind open and
be willing to exercise doubt,'' said Marinoff, who with his bushy
beard and contemplative gaze looks like he'd be perfectly at home
in a toga and sandals. ``People who have too much faith and not
enough doubt tend to get dogmatic.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what had happened at Ohio Casualty, which writes property
and casualty business. In 1991, Patch had just been promoted to
president of the publicly traded company, taking over day-to-day
control from his father-in-law, who remained chairman. With 4,200
employees, $5 billion in assets and $17 billion in premiums, Ohio
Casualty wasn't small enough to be a niche player, but it also
wasn't big enough to compete with larger companies. ``We really had
to differentiate ourselves in a way that customers would appreciate
so we could sustain the business,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It would have been easy to sell the company, he says, but he
rejected all feelers. Still, he knew that many companies of Ohio
Casualty's size had been priced out of the market in recent years.
So Patch brought in Morris, the founder of the Morris Institute for
Human Values, a Wilmington, N.C., think tank that applies
philosophical teachings to contemporary business. Some of the
questions he ponders: How do you move people to new forms of
behavior? How does a company set valuable objectives from the
start? How do you attain a deep sense of fulfillment? How do you
get people to trust change?
</P>
<P>
   Morris, who taught philosophy at Notre Dame for 15 years, said
his approach was basically to get employees ``to think more deeply
about their jobs'' as a source of personal fulfillment rather than
just something they must do. It might sound a little corny, but, he
said, studying the works of the ancient Greek philosophers inspired
employees at Ohio Casualty to think in new ways about fulfilling
their lives in ways that would also have the practical effect of
revivifying the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lauren had taken over a company that had long been run in the
old authoritarian, command-and-control style,'' Morris said. ``He
was trying hard to make a transition to a team-oriented, empowered
organization. But people had old habits of mind and just weren't
getting it yet. It was in that context that I first consulted
Aristotle's `Politics' and latched on to his view of a city as,
ideally, `a partnership for living well.' If this could be the
ideal essence of a city, then why not of a company?''
</P>
<P>
   With Morris as facilitator, the group discussed and defined
different types of leaders, from Machiavelli's prince to more
benign role models. They also talked about the nature of change and
how to prepare for it. ``You don't get through change without a
change in leadership,'' he said. They explored the seven universal
conditions for success _ conception, confidence, concentration,
consistency, commitment, character and capacity to enjoy _ that he
says he culled from the teachings of Aristotle and Plato. And they
talked about implementing them in the work environment.
</P>
<P>
   Once the decision was taken to stay independent, the next
question was: How? Ohio Casualty realized it had to grow to stay
competitive, and last December, it acquired Great American
Insurance Co., a unit of the American Financial Group in
Cincinnati, increasing its size by about a third.
</P>
<P>
   The merger of two companies can be stressful for employees, who
worry about how their careers will be affected and who have to
adjust to new co-workers, and here, Patch said, the ancient Greeks
and Romans, and Indians and Chinese, too, came in handy.
</P>
<P>
   ``No philosopher wrote about mergers and acquisitions per se,
but many talked about adapting to change,'' Patch said. ``If you
were a Stoic, they counseled you on looking at a problem without
emotion. When you deal with people it can be so difficult, they
attach all kinds of emotion and distort perceptions. Tom's teaching
prepared people for the types of anxieties they would deal with in
any kind of business transaction.''
</P>
<P>
   Philosophical counselors say they make around $75 to $100 an
hour for one-on-one sessions, comparable with what psychologists
make. And Morris, who has also done consulting for the Pontiac
division of General Motors, Coca-Cola and Merrill Lynch, says he
makes $20,000 to $30,000 for his corporate speeches.
</P>
<P>
   He quotes Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics: ``You cannot possibly
pay a philosopher what he's worth, but try your best.''

BUSINESS TRAVEL: BROWSING FOR FARES, HOTELS ON EXPEDIA.COM; JETBLUE
SET 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   It suddenly became easier yesterday to browse for air fares,
hotel room rates and other business services on Expedia.com, the
most heavily used online booking engine for leisure and business
travel.
</P>
<P>
   The company dropped the requirement that visitors must register
and provide basic personal information before using the site to
shop for fares and other rates.
</P>
<P>
   The move came three days after the nation's leading retailer,
Wal-Mart Stores, launched its own travel-booking engine as part of
an ambitious expansion of its Web shopping site. The new Wal-Mart
travel-booking engine does not require users to register first.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a fundamental shift in the way we're looking at things,''
said Erik Blachford, the vice president of marketing for Expedia
Inc., a subsidiary of Microsoft, which has become the leader in the
free-for-all world of online travel booking. ``We decided that we
were turning away a lot of people who weren't comfortable with
registration. It was an unnecessary barrier, so we just decided we
would get rid of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Blachford said that Expedia's decision to drop the registration
requirement was not prompted by Wal-Mart's entry into the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wal-Mart didn't really enter into this decision at all,'' he
said. ``I mean, I'm aware that they just put up their site, but it
didn't have any effect on our decision. This is something we did in
response to what our customers have been telling us.''
</P>
<P>
   Studies have shown that the registration procedures typically
required by online booking services and other internet commerce
sites are a strong disincentive to many users, who ``just turn
around and go away,'' Blachford said, when they are asked to
provide basic personal information like a name and e-mail address
before getting access to the information on a site.
</P>
<P>
   Online commerce companies usually hold their registration
databases in high regard as an indication that their potential
customers are committed enough to provide personal information. But
Blachford said that Expedia decided to concentrate instead on
direct booking revenue and the sheer number of ``hits'' that the
site received.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, the more we looked at it the more we realized that
the value that people are putting on these registration databases
is hugely overstated,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   During the five-week Christmas shopping period, Expedia was the
ninth most heavily visited e-commerce Web site, according to Media
Metrix, which compiles Internet traffic data. In 1998, Expedia had
retail travel sales of $250 million, up from $100 million the year
before. Analysts have estimated that Expedia's sales will exceed
$500 million for 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Melisa Berryhill, a spokeswoman for Wal-Mart, said that the
retail giant had carefully designed its Web site to encourage
people to browse easily.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal in the first year is to earn our customers' trust for
their travel needs,'' she said. ``We wanted to start by keeping it
very simple. We look to evolve it from there. People do not need to
register before using our site.''
</P>
<P>
   Expedia's Blachford said that while Wal-Mart was a potential
competitor down the line in the growing online travel business,
``we tend to look at the Wal-Mart travel site as an aisle in the
Wal-Mart store. Most people don't want want to buy their travel
from an aisle in a store.''
</P>
<P>
   JetBlue Is Set to Fly
</P>
<P>
   JetBlue Airways, one of the most ambitious airline start-ups
ever, is prepared to start operations next month with low-cost
flights out of New York's Kennedy International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pending final government approval, our first flights are Feb.
11, a double inauguration schedule to Fort Lauderdale and
Buffalo,'' said Gareth Edmondson-Jones, a spokesman for the
airline, which is based in New York and plans to advertise fares
that average about 65 percent less than competitors on a route
schedule that will include about a dozen cities by the end of this
year.
</P>
<P>
   The airline, which ultimately plans a fleet of 82 new Airbus
A-320 aircraft, plans to stress low fares, on-board comfort and
high-technology services like automated check-in and television
monitors with in-flight satellite-TV broadcasts for every seat. New
Week, when tickets go on sale, fares for the initial destinations
will be announced. Edmondson-Jones said yesterday that one-way
fares to Fort Lauderdale, Fla., would start at $79, and to Buffalo
at $49.
</P>
<P>
   While many start-up airlines have failed, analysts tracking the
launch of JetBlue have been impressed with its $130 million in
equity capitalization, partly financed by the investor George
Soros. Eventually, the company hopes to offer flights to cities
throughout the East Coast, as well and to some destinations in the
Midwest and Southwest. &QL;

EDITORIAL: ANOTHER TERM FOR GREENSPAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, Jan. 5: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Most economists believe Alan Greenspan is more responsible for
the economy's spectacular performance than Congress, Presidents
Bush and Clinton or any other identifiable factor. Under his
leadership, the Federal Reserve Board has driven inflation and
unemployment down to 30-year lows. Greenspan is widely regarded as
one of the most successful chairmen in the history of the Fed. On
Tuesday, President Clinton wisely nominated him to a fourth term,
ending disruptive speculation that he might decide to appoint
someone else.
</P>
<P>
   When Greenspan took over the Fed in 1987, unemployment was above
6 percent and inflation exceeded 4 percent. Twelve years later, the
inflation rate _ the one economic outcome for which the Fed is
entirely responsible _ has fallen to about 2 percent, about as low
as many economists deem advisable. Interest rates have fallen
significantly, and unemployment is at its lowest level in decades,
around 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan has been both lucky and very astute. He did not
produce the low foreign oil prices or higher productivity growth
that have occurred during his tenure. That was merely good fortune.
But by setting clear objectives and exercising smart judgment, he
let the economy take full advantage of both trends.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, he settled on one clear and unvarying objective.
His goal is low, steady inflation, and he has not allowed the Fed
to become sidetracked by focusing on foreign exchange rates, stock
prices or the growth rate of the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Next, points out Mickey Levy, chief economist at the Bank of
America, he has exercised timely judgment. In the early 1990s, when
the banks were in atrocious financial condition, he manipulated the
money supply to keep interest rates, and therefore their borrowing
costs, low. When the banks recovered in 1994, he raised rates back
to sustainable levels. In 1996 and 1997, when the economy grew
faster than the Fed's economic models thought possible without
igniting inflation, Greenspan did not crack down. He chose instead
to wait until the threatened inflation actually appeared. It never
did, so he had given the economy leeway to produce millions of jobs
that few economists had thought possible.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the Fed reduced rates to inoculate the economy against
the financial crisis sweeping across Asia. Then, last year, it
raised rates once the Asian threat dissolved. The upshot of these
successful decisions is that investors trust Greenspan. They do not
overreact _ driving interest rates higher and aborting recoveries _
at the first sign of inflationary pressure because they trust that
he will keep inflation in check.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan did not create the labor markets that have allowed
unemployment to fall to its lowest levels since the 1960s without
setting wages ablaze. But he was wise enough to sit back while
unemployment fell to levels that most economists thought unsafe and
that would have driven most of his predecessors to take anti-growth
actions. He thereby discovered, and proved to the world, that the
American economy could do better than nearly everyone thought
possible. On Tuesday, Clinton assured that his careful stewardship
of the economy will continue.

KATHERINE LEE REID TO BECOME MUSEUM CHIEF IN CLEVELAND 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Va. ATTN)  (ms) 
 By JUDITH H. DOBRZYNSKI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a choice that seems sentimental as well as practical, the
Cleveland Museum of Art is to announce on Wednesday that Katharine
Lee Reid will become its new director. Ms. Reid, director of the
Virginia Museum of Fine Arts in Richmond, is the daughter of the
Cleveland's legendary director, Sherman E. Lee, a Chinese-art
scholar who ran the museum from 1958 to 1983 and built it into a
leading showplace for Asian art.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Reid, whose areas of expertise include 17th-century European
paintings, 20th-century art and late-19th- and early-20th-century
American and European decorative arts, will succeed Robert P.
Bergman, who died last May after contracting a rare blood disorder.
</P>
<P>
   Under the leadership of Ms. Reid, 58, the Virginia museum, a
state-supported institution with a comprehensive collection,
reinstalled most of its collection and broadened programs that
reach out to the community, particularly to African-Americans. Last
year, with presentation of the blockbuster ``Splendors of Ancient
Egypt,'' the largest exhibition in its history, and a tour of
selections from its permanent Egyptian collection to sites
throughout Virginia, the museum drew a record total attendance of
800,000, compared with 450,000 in other recent years).
</P>
<P>
   Average annual attendance at the Cleveland museum, whose
collection is supported by an abundant endowment and is known for
its high quality, is 600,000.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, reached at his home in North Carolina, said his daughter's
new job ``comes as a complete surprise to me; she was doing very
well at Richmond.'' He added, ``I'm very proud of her, of course.''
</P>
<P>
   Before joining the Virginia museum in 1991, Ms. Reid was deputy
director of the Art Institute of Chicago. She has also had
curatorial positions at the Ackland Art Museum at the University of
North Carolina at Chapel Hill, the David and Alfred Smart Museum at
the University of Chicago and the Toledo Museum of Art. A graduate
of Vassar, Ms. Reid holds a master's degree from Harvard University
and was a Fulbright scholar.
</P>
<P>
   She will assume her new duties on March 13. Until then, Kate
Sellars, the museum's deputy director, remains acting director.

EDITORIAL: A HIJACKING'S DANGEROUS FALLOUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times says in an editorial Wednesday, Jan. 5: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Less than a week after the release of 155 hostages from a
hijacked Indian Airlines jet, India and Pakistan are firing
dangerously inflammatory charges and countercharges at each other
over the incident. Though no evidence has come to light to support
the allegations, each side is accusing the other of masterminding
the hijacking or somehow aiding those who carried it out. The
danger of an escalating confrontation between two nuclear powers is
once again present, this time only a few months before President
Clinton's scheduled visit to the Asian subcontinent.
</P>
<P>
   The hijacking unfolded in a confusing fashion, and there are
still many mysteries surrounding it. The Indian Airlines plane was
seized after leaving Katmandu in Nepal on Dec. 24, whereupon it
landed successively in India, Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates
before coming to rest in the southern Afghan city of Kandahar.
India charges that some of the hijackers were Pakistanis, and that
they may have fled to Pakistan after the incident. Pakistan angrily
denies the charges, asserting that if India feels it knows the
identity of the hijackers, perhaps New Delhi was involved.
</P>
<P>
   The recriminations are flaring in part because of India's
embarrassment over its handling of the episode. Questions are being
raised within India about the decision to accede to the hijackers'
demand and release three jailed Islamic militants accused of
involvement in the rebellion in Kashmir, the only Indian state with
a Muslim majority. Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee's government
is also under fire over the lax security that allowed armed
hijackers to board the plane.
</P>
<P>
   The first order of business for India and Pakistan is to come
forward with any evidence to back their charges and to refrain from
provocative accusations if they have no evidence. Next, the two
countries must start repairing relations by sharing sensitive
information about military maneuvers and restarting their dialogue
toward signing the comprehensive test ban treaty. Since India and
Pakistan tested their nuclear weapons in 1998, their leaders have
made countless promises to take confidence-building steps, exchange
information and engage in dialogue over mutual sources of tension,
particularly Kashmir. These promises must now at last be kept.
</P>
<P>
   Another confusing factor in the hijacking is the role of the
Taliban, the group that controls the Afghan government but is not
recognized by the United States or many other countries. Until the
hijacking, India routinely characterized the Taliban as a pawn of
Pakistani intelligence services. Now Indian officials have praised
the Taliban for its role in ending the hostage crisis. Many outside
experts wonder if the Taliban actually helped the hijackers escape,
perhaps over the nearby border to Pakistan or into the hills of
southern Afghanistan where Islamic terrorist training camps are
believed to operate. Taliban spokesmen deny aiding the hijackers.
</P>
<P>
   Though the hijacking episode ended peacefully, it served as
another reminder of the broad dangers of India-Pakistan enmity.
Their mutual distrust and hatred have churned along for decades,
without people outside the region paying much attention except at
major flashpoints. That situation is no longer acceptable. Pakistan
has asked repeatedly for the United Nations to become involved, a
step India opposes because of its desire to negotiate all
differences directly with Pakistan. Some sort of outside push may
be needed, however, if not from the U.N. then from the United
States or other interested intermediaries. Clinton's scheduled
visit later this year could provide just such an impetus to get the
two sides talking instead of firing accusations at each other. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the so-called supermodels is sashaying to the rescue of a
troubled cereal marketer seeking to improve stagnant sales of its
flagship brands.
</P>
<P>
   Cindy Crawford, part of the elite corps of mannequins who gained
super status in part by peddling a lengthy list of products for
blue-chip advertisers, will for the first time serve as an endorser
for Kellogg Co. In a campaign beginning this week by Leo Burnett
USA in Chicago, Ms. Crawford will become the face _ and body _
representing Special K, the brand of multigrain flakes that is
Kellogg's principal entry in the crowded category of cereals aimed
at health-conscious women ages 25 to 49.
</P>
<P>
   The Crawford campaign, with a celebrity endorser as its focus,
marks an abrupt return to more traditional sales pitches for
Special K. A recent effort took an unconventional tack by
addressing the issue of women's complaints about unrealistic
portrayals of body imagery in the media. Those ads, also by
Burnett, first started appearing in Canada in 1996 and were
subsequently exported to this country.
</P>
<P>
   The best-known element of that campaign, which carried the theme
``Look good on your own terms,'' was an unusually frank and
humorous commercial in which men uttered the kinds of self-critical
statements about their looks that are typically voiced by women.
The spot was a reason why Marketing Magazine, a Canadian
advertising trade publication, selected Kellogg Canada as one of
the ``10 marketers that made a difference'' in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   It's unfortunate that the ``Look good'' campaign _ so on the
edge for a mainstream product _ is disappearing in the United
States; it's continuing to run in Canada. But it seemed too risky
for Kellogg at a time when the company confronts intensified
competition in the cereal market, which has been flatter than a
corn flake as busy breakfast eaters seek more convenient fare.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was designed to be disruptive,'' said Betsy Andersen, vice
president and account director at Leo Burnett USA, part of the Leo
Burnett Co. unit of Leo Group, ``but we may have been a little too
far ahead of the curve.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Women loved the advertising,'' she added, ``but we didn't
highlight what the brand did for you and the role the product can
play as a sensible way to manage your weight.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really excited about the Cindy promotion,'' Ms. Andersen
said. ``The category is tough, so we're doing everything we can to
keep our brands relevant.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, according to Information Resources Inc., a market
research company, in the four weeks ending Dec. 5, Kellogg lost its
longtime ranking as the cereal volume sales leader to General Mills
Inc., which surpassed Kellogg in July as the cereal sales leader in
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've done extensive consumer research'' on the ``Look good''
campaign, said Celeste Clark, senior vice president for nutrition
and marketing communications at Kellogg in Battle Creek, Mich., and
they found that ``the key component missing was the aspirational
aspect of wanting to look better, feel better, than you actually
do.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Cindy Crawford embodies what the brand represents and adds
back in the aspiration,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem with the previous campaign, Ms. Clark said, was
that ``it ignored the diet proposition, including Special K as part
of your regimen to look and feel good.''
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, she added, the new campaign, which includes a
contest and displaying Ms. Crawford on Special K packages as well
as advertising, ``emphasizes the importance of eating healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   In a commercial, Ms. Crawford is seen in garb and hairdos from
the '60s and '70s. ``Fads in fashion can be as silly as fads in
diets today,'' she says. ``That's why I eat Special K. It's not one
of those fad diets that makes your weight drop down and then shoot
right back up again.''
</P>
<P>
   At the end, as Ms. Crawford appears in a casual, contemporary
outfit, she declares: ``Make a New Year's resolution that will work
for years to come. Wouldn't it be nice to look back and think `I
looked great?'''
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview, Ms. Crawford said she believed the
campaign in no way appealed to stereotyped images of female beauty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can relate to women feeling intimidated by those images,''
Ms. Crawford said. ``At shows, I'm the biggest one. I'll go to a
shoot and none of the clothes would fit because Kate Moss was
wearing them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Kate Moss is not anorexic,'' Ms. Crawford hastened to add
about her sister supermodel. ``That's who she is.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But the fashion world could be a little more responsible,''
said Ms. Crawford, who also endorses brands like Pepsi-Cola and
Revlon. ``I'm hopeful we'll see more diversity in body types in the
new millennium, just as we've seen more diverse skin colors. Women
would embrace that; that's the biggest complaint I hear.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one reason I'm popular,'' she concluded. ``People can
relate to me. I'm not superskinny.''
</P>
<P>
   And Ms. Crawford also had a baby, a boy named Presley, six
months ago. ``It's flattering to me,'' she said about Kellogg's
endorsement offer, terms of which were not disclosed. ``Special K
has always stood for being in shape.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Andersen, too, mentioned Ms. Crawford's recent motherhood.
``Cindy brought a lot to the party,'' she said, ``who is she, what
our target's perceptions of her are.''
</P>
<P>
   The budget for the campaign is estimated at $7 million. The
contest offers prizes that include five trips to have breakfast
with Ms. Crawford and makeovers by Team Cindy, her stable of
personal care professionals like Radu, her trainer, and Steven
Knoll, her hair stylist.
</P>
<P>
   Can Monica Lewinsky and Jenny Craig match that?

EDITORIAL: MONEY GAMES IN THE SENATE RACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times says in an editorial Wednesday, Jan. 5: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It is a reality of modern campaigns that contests for important
offices often become struggles for publicity, and candidates are
driven to find ways to use their existing public positions to
increase their favorable exposure to voters. So there was nothing
particularly surprising, or for that matter offensive, about Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani's high profile during the televised New Year's Eve
festivities in Times Square, or about the White House's decision to
have Hillary Rodham Clinton join President Clinton in delivering a
televised greeting to the nation from the Oval Office on New Year's
Day.
</P>
<P>
   But as a matter of government ethics, electoral fairness and
simple good taste, some things ought to remain out of bounds. We
include in this category Giuliani's new tactic of using the city's
tourism agency, NYC &AMP; Co., to finance promotional radio ads
featuring his voice in New York City and upstate areas sure to be a
prime battleground in the Senate race. We also refer to Mrs.
Clinton's apparent determination to introduce the soft-money abuses
pioneered by Clinton's 1996 re-election campaign as a regular
feature of New York politics.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani has done ads promoting city tourism for the past four
years, but notably, this is the first time they are to be broadcast
upstate. A 1998 law passed by the city council and signed by
Giuliani bans candidates for city office from promoting themselves
with city funds in an election year. Regrettably, though, the ban
does not cover candidates for federal office. The council needs to
plug this loophole. Meanwhile, the city's winter tourism campaign
should continue, but without Giuliani as the on-the-air talent.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton, for her part, seems intent on evading federal
limits on a candidate's fund-raising by channeling huge chunks of
unregulated soft money to a special ``victory fund'' set up by the
Democratic Party to help pay for a portion of her television ads.
The Washington Post reported that Mrs. Clinton had raised in excess
of $360,000 for this fund and attended 11 fund-raisers designed to
garner soft money. Also, last October, the Democratic Senate
Campaign Committee received a whopping $500,000 contribution from
New York's largest health care union.
</P>
<P>
   This eager collection of soft money continued as Mrs. Clinton
was being criticized for allowing the New York State Democratic
Party to run television spots promoting her Senate candidacy. The
$338,000 ad campaign was financed mostly by soft-money
contributions, including large gifts that would have been barred
under federal law had they been given directly to the Clinton
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Republicans who started the use of such state-level
committees. But so far, Giuliani has refrained from joining the
soft-money fund-raising race. Mrs. Clinton should forswear soft
money and challenge the mayor to do the same, and he should order
NYC &AMP; Co. to quit running taxpayer-financed ads designed to help
him politically.

EPA MOVES CLOSER TO SEEKING GE CLEANUP OF POLLUTANTS IN HUDSON 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By ANDREW C. REVKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Releasing the final installment in its eight-year study of
Hudson River pollution, the federal Environmental Protection Agency
moved significantly closer Tuesday to ordering a costly cleanup of
buried PCBs, toxic chemicals dumped for decades at two old General
Electric factories in the river's northern reaches.
</P>
<P>
   The agency has not concluded that GE will be required to dredge
PCBs buried in the upper river, which could cost the company
hundreds of millions of dollars. But its latest report expands the
area of the river where contamination in fish poses an unacceptable
health hazard to people eating them, adding the stretch from Troy
south to Poughkeepsie, the segment of the river most popular with
anglers.
</P>
<P>
   The findings are more evidence pointing to the need for a
cleanup, EPA officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, an EPA report found that there were unacceptable
health risks in the upper river, from Troy to the factories, in
Fort Edward and Hudson Falls, 40 miles north.
</P>
<P>
   The cancer risk from Troy south to Poughkeepsie is only about
one-third of the risk estimated for people eating fish farther
north, officials said. The risk from Troy to Poughkeepsie amounts
to an additional 1-in-2,500 chance of developing cancer for someone
who eats a weekly meal of Hudson River fish. But it is still 100
times higher than the agency finds acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   ``These studies are like the columns holding up a temple,'' Ann
Rychlenski, a spokeswoman for the agency, said Tuesday. ``They
create an interlocking body of evidence. We see there is a problem,
it's not going away on its own, and it comes from those old
sediments.''
</P>
<P>
   Carol M. Browner, the EPA administrator, has said that the
agency will decide by the end of the year what must be done to
clean the Hudson. But representatives of some private environmental
groups said the agency had taken too much time. With a presidential
election looming, any decision by Ms. Browner could be reversed in
2001, they said.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, GE has spent more than $100 million stanching
the flow of PCBs from its factory grounds and from seeps along the
river banks and has conducted extensive studies of its own, which
it says show that the problem has been overstated by government
officials.
</P>
<P>
   Mark L. Behan, a spokesman for the company, said Tuesday that
the buried chemical deposits posed no risk to the river or to
people using it, and added that GE was largely solving the
contamination problem by cutting off new releases of PCBs to the
river.
</P>
<P>
   He said that state health advisories already recommend that
people strictly limit their consumption of most Hudson River fish
and recommend that children and pregnant women eat no fish from the
river.
</P>
<P>
   The latest EPA study did not assess the health and dietary
patterns of the people living along the river, but instead relied
on calculations based on levels of PCB's found in fish and on
cancer studies in laboratory animals, agency officials said.
</P>
<P>
   EPA officials said that their calculations were based on rules
set out by federal pollution laws and that state advisories on fish
consumption did not affect their conclusions about health risks.
</P>
<P>
   PCBs, or polychlorinated biphenyls, were popular industrial
chemicals until they were banned as a probable cause of cancer in
1977. Federal officials have estimated that the two GE factories on
the banks of the upper Hudson dumped more than a million pounds of
PCBs before the ban.
</P>
<P>
   About 40 ``hot spots'' of submerged PCBs remain in the river
north of a dam at Troy, and the EPA contends that most of the
contamination of fish comes from seepage from these deposits.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists working for GE say that the federal studies are
flawed and argue that the PCBs in the river are safely buried and
that the company's efforts to control leakage from the shores have
already reduced contamination in fish.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which is responsible for the cost of any cleanup
under the federal Superfund law, has conducted an intensive
research program and public relations campaign along the river,
rebutting each stage of the EPA's research.
</P>
<P>
   Behan, the company spokesman, said Tuesday that GE officials had
not yet seen the new study and would file extensive comments once
they were able to analyze it.
</P>
<P>
   From the news release, he said, it appeared that ``what we have
is an estimate of theoretical risk based on conditions which don't
exist in reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of several private environmental groups said the
final report was a welcome sign that the federal government seemed
poised to act to clean the river. But some criticized the agency
for taking so many years to compile its findings.
</P>
<P>
   John Cronin, the chief environmental advocate for Riverkeeper, a
group in the Hudson Valley, said that federal studies had come to
the same conclusions as long ago as 1973 _ but nothing was done
about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're looking at now is 27 years of reaffirming that PCBs
are a health threat in the Hudson, that the fish are contaminated,
that PCBs are moving through the estuary, and they're not
degrading,'' Cronin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question now,'' he said, ``is will the EPA have the
courage and political will to act on its own findings?''

INTRUDERS STEAL SAFE, BUT CAN'T REACH THE CONTENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 BY ANNE LAMOY  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Janie Smith thought she was ready for
anything _ even Y2K.
</P>
<P>
   Stashed inside a 6-foot-tall, 600-pound metal safe tucked in the
laundry room of Smith's western Kansas City, Kan., home were guns,
jewelry, bank certificates of deposit, piles of cash and baseball
cards.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few months, Smith and her husband had been
squirreling away extra cash in the safe, in case of dire
occurrences on New Year's Eve or New Year's Day.
</P>
<P>
   What Smith did not expect was that someone would cart that safe
out of her home.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing is huge and heavy,'' Smith said Tuesday. ``I didn't
think anybody would bother my safe.''
</P>
<P>
   But that is what happened late the night of Dec. 26 or early
Dec. 27.
</P>
<P>
   The Wyandotte County district attorney's office contends that
four young Kansas City, Kan., men broke into the Smith home and
wheeled the safe to a van on a dolly.
</P>
<P>
   The safe was found unopened Dec. 28 _ hinges and lock dial
broken _ in woods near the Wyandotte-Leavenworth county line. The
contents were intact.
</P>
<P>
   Four men have been charged with burglary and theft. The
defendants are Steven Gabb and David June, both 18, and Corey Jones
and Dustin Ash, both 19. Ash, the only one to have posted bond, is
the son of veteran Kansas City, Kan., Police Lt. Don Ash. The three
other defendants were in the Wyandotte County Detention Center
Tuesday; bonds were set at $5,000 each.
</P>
<P>
   Police Detective Bob Lane said that one or more of the young men
knew about the safe.
</P>
<P>
   The Smiths' home is in the 10700 block of Rowland Court, north
of Kansas Speedway, which is under construction. Lane said that the
burglary occurred sometime between dark on Dec. 26 and 1:15 a.m.
Dec. 27 and that the burglars entered the home once, left and
returned later.
</P>
<P>
   He said they got in through a garage window and used a dolly
inside the house to get the safe to a van.
</P>
<P>
   Lane said that within a day, detectives learned the name of one
of the four. The young man led police to a grassy, wooded area
about a mile from Marxen and Wolcott roads, in northwest Wyandotte
County, Lane said.
</P>
<P>
   Police had the safe towed to Smith's house, where a locksmith
opened it. Inside were four guns, rings, bracelets, a necklace,
earrings, $1,300 in cash, certificates of deposit and baseball
cards.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said Tuesday that she had learned her lesson: She quickly
obtained a safe deposit box at a bank for the certificates of
deposit and jewelry.
</P>
<P>
   And if the Smiths get another safe, she said, it will be bolted
to the floor.

ANNUAL REVENUE FROM BETTING IS UP AT THE WOODLANDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 BY RICK ALM  
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the first time in The Woodlands' 10-year history, annual
revenue from betting is up. Not much, mind you, but the Kansas
City, Kan., track has turned a corner.
</P>
<P>
   The combined ``handle'' for all live and simulcast dog and horse
races in 1999 was $65.4 million, up from $64.6 million a year ago.
The parimutuel track took in $197 million in 1990, its first full
year of operation, but betting has slipped every year since then.
</P>
<P>
   Principal owner Bill Grace was encouraged, but he is by no means
optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``All this means is we're losing less money,'' he said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The numbers are up, and the only reason they're up is the
increased marketing activity. But it does prove you can improve the
operation.''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, unless Congress or the Kansas Legislature allows the
track to add slot machines to its gambling mix, Grace said, the
track ``is going to have to close. ... We can't continue to operate
a facility that continues to lose money.''
</P>
<P>
   Gambling foes have argued with mixed success in recent years
that dying racetracks shouldn't be financially propped up with
revenue from other forms of gambling.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Schneider, president of the anti-gambling citizens lobby
Kansans for Life at Its Best, said the organization would fight the
slots bill in Topeka again this year.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, International Gaming &AMP; Wagering Business magazine
concluded in its study of racetrack-casino operations published
last month that ``gaming machines are not a panacea for the racing
industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1990, Delaware, Iowa, Louisiana, New Mexico, Rhode Island,
West Virginia and four Canadian provinces have authorized
conversion of state-licensed racetracks into ``racinos.''
</P>
<P>
   Other states are debating similar proposals, including Kentucky,
New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, California, New York, Florida,
Illinois, Maryland and Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   At most tracks where it has been tried, slot revenue underwrites
racing with bigger purses and better public facilities _ which
spurs higher-quality races and a bigger racing handle.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most successful racinos is the Prairie Meadows dog
track near Des Moines, Iowa. Since the installation of 1,200 slots
in 1995, the racing handle has more than doubled, from $39.4
million in 1995 to $81.9 million in 1998, the magazine reported.
The slots alone brought in $127 million that year.
</P>
<P>
   A bill pending in Congress since 1998 and sponsored by Rep.
Dennis Moore, a Johnson County Democrat, would authorize the
Wyandotte Tribe of Oklahoma to operate a casino in Wyandotte
County. It seeks to compensate the tribe for Congress' decision in
1997 that barred it from using its historical Huron Cemetery lands
in downtown Kansas City, Kan., for a high-stakes bingo parlor.
</P>
<P>
   If Moore's bill becomes law, Grace and the tribe are expected to
negotiate a deal in which Grace would sell The Woodlands to the
tribe and its partners and then lease it back to operate racing and
the casino.
</P>
<P>
   Whether state approval of the arrangement is necessary under the
federal legislation is one of the issues pending in a related
federal court case.
</P>
<P>
   State legislation for 2000 isn't in final form yet, but
Woodlands lobbyist Brad Smoot said he expected it to be based on
last year's bill that fell a handful of votes short in the Kansas
Senate. The legislation also would affect tracks in Sedgwick and
Crawford counties.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas lawmakers have resisted expansion of legalized gambling
throughout the boom years of the 1990s. But the economic climate
may be changing.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas Gov. Bill Graves is proposing to slash $67.4 million from
current state spending.
</P>
<P>
   Public education would suffer one of the largest cuts _ $21.9
million. Instead of receiving an additional $50 per student in
promised state aid this year, schools would get only $37 more per
student, according to the governor's plan.
</P>
<P>
   Smoot said ``new tax dollars'' was the message he would be
delivering to state lawmakers this year.
</P>
<P>
   He estimates that Kansans who gamble at the Kansas City area
riverboats indirectly pay $45 million a year in Missouri casino
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's $45 million a year that's going to Missouri schools,''
he said. ``That's the kind of issue that will resonate in Topeka.''
</P>
<P>
   But Smoot acknowledged that the issue of gambling taxes lost to
Missouri had been raised before: ``It's an argument that takes time
to get attention. It takes time for legislators to realize how much
gaming is really all around them.''
</P>
<P>
   Schneider, of the anti-gambling group, isn't convinced the
political winds in Kansas are shifting toward gambling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see the climate changing,'' he said. ``I'm not sure
that (financial crunch) argument is as compelling or attractive as
it used to be. Maybe it's been around too long.''
</P>
<P>
   Grace said his group would try it at least one more time.
``We're going to design a package that everybody's going to be
happy with,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   By putting slots at the track, ``we're not expanding gambling at
all,'' Grace said. ``We're already well down that road,'' with four
tribal casinos, pari-mutuel racing, the state lottery and bingo
already legal in Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   Though the details aren't set, local option balloting in
counties with tracks would be the first step toward legal racinos
in Kansas. If licensed by the state, the new casino games would be
overseen by the Kansas Lottery and taxed by state and local
governments. Under the legislation proposed last year, the state
would have received 16 percent of slot machine revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Grace said other slot revenue would be earmarked for charities
and to benefit the state's greyhound, thoroughbred and quarter
horse industries.
</P>
<P>
   Grace also is principal owner of the St. Jo Frontier Casino in
St. Joseph, and his companies have a management interest in a
tribal casino near White Cloud, Kan.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend Grace opened his Lakeside Casino &AMP; Resort on West
Lake, about 45 miles south of Des Moines. A marina and RV park for
75 vehicles are under construction.
</P>
<P>
   Grace's privately held construction, development and real estate
management firm also has interests in shopping centers, hotels and
other properties in Mexico and five Western states. The company
also operates a hotel in cooperation with a tribal casino near
Prescott, Ariz.

RESEARCHER STUDIES LEAVENWORTH CEMETERY FOR POSSIBLE LINK TO THOMAS
JEFFERSON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 BY KEVIN MURPHY  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The search for descendants of Thomas Jefferson has
led to Leavenworth National Cemetery in Kansas, where a small
weathered, gray stone marks the resting place of a Civil War
veteran who could be the third president's grandson.
</P>
<P>
   A Maryland researcher spent 17 months trying to find the grave
of William Hemings, who died in 1910 and may provide further
evidence of Jefferson's alleged sexual relationship with one of his
slaves, Sally Hemings.
</P>
<P>
   The researcher wants to exhume William Hemings and conduct DNA
testing, but the Hemings descendants object.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm here to get the truth, I don't care how it falls,'' said
Herbert Barger, 73, who has studied Jefferson's genealogy for more
than 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   Barger said his research led him to Kansas because a 1990 book
on the Hemings family mentioned that William Hemings had written a
relative a letter from Kansas. Hemings, from Ohio, had served in
the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   Barger contacted historian Dennis Giangreco, an editor of the
journal Military Review based at Fort Leavenworth. Giangreco
referred Barger to National Cemetery records, which showed a
William Hemings to be among 26,000 people buried there.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has just come out of the blue,'' said Jeff Barnes,
director of the cemetery. ``We knew he was here, we just didn't
know the history.''
</P>
<P>
   The cemetery was started in 1886 adjacent to the grounds of the
former Western Branch National Home for Disabled Volunteer Soldiers
in Leavenworth, where Hemings died.
</P>
<P>
   Barger wanted to find William Hemings because he believes he is
the son of Madison Hemings, who in the mid-1800s claimed to be
Jefferson's son by Sally Hemings. William was born in 1847, Barger
said.
</P>
<P>
   No one has found the grave of Madison Hemings, but exhuming the
body of William Hemings for DNA testing could prove or disprove a
Jefferson link, Barger said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to add science to the oral history of this,''
Barger said. ``If there is no (DNA) match, we must assume Madison
is incorrect in his statements to his descendants.''
</P>
<P>
   DNA testing two years ago on living descendants of Madison's
younger brother, Eston Hemings, found a link to Jefferson or a male
relative.
</P>
<P>
   Descendants of Sally Hemings believe the former president
fathered children by her, but others said it could have been one of
eight Jefferson males who lived around the Virginia plantation,
Monticello.
</P>
<P>
   Barger thinks the father in question was Randolph Jefferson, the
former president's younger brother, who lived 20 miles from
Monticello and was between wives while Hemings was bearing all but
the first of her six or seven children.
</P>
<P>
   Two descendants of Madison Hemings said they would oppose
exhuming William Hemings, partly because they can't be sure he is
the same William Hemings or that his grave is properly marked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know they say that is him in the ground, but I really
wouldn't know who it is,''' said Shay Banks-Young, a
great-great-great-granddaughter of Madison Hemings. ``What right do
I have digging him up?''
</P>
<P>
   Another distant Hemings descendant, Lantz Balthazar, said he
also couldn't be sure Barger found the right William Hemings.
Besides, Balthazar said, any tests would not change evidence
already linking a Jefferson male to the Hemings family.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems that (Barger) is more intent on disproving that
Madison Hemings is a legitimate son of Thomas Jefferson,''
Balthazar said.
</P>
<P>
   Barger's wife, Evelyn Barger, is a sixth generation first cousin
of Thomas Jefferson through his uncle, Field Jefferson. Barger said
his research is not meant to clean up Jefferson's reputation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Character I don't get into, but others do, of course,'' Barger
said.
</P>
<P>
   The findings released in 1998 showing links between Hemings'
descendants and Jefferson or a male relative upset some of his
descendants and admirers. Banks-Young said tests on William Hemings
would only rekindle animosity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under no circumstances will they conclude that the Jefferson
in question is Thomas Jefferson,'' she said. She suggested
Jefferson himself be exhumed, but Barger said blood tests from
Jefferson relatives are enough to pinpoint his DNA without having
to test him, too.
</P>
<P>
   Madison Hemings had four sons and five daughters, but none of
their graves had been found until now. DNA from a male descendant
is needed to match Y-chromosomes to earlier Jefferson males.
</P>
<P>
   There are few details known about William Hemings' life, but
stories have been passed through the generations about a son of
Madison Hemings who was very tall and lived in Columbus, Ohio,
Banks-Young said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have this mystery man all of us talk about, and we think
this is the only person it could have been because the other
(siblings) had died,'' Banks-Young said.
</P>
<P>
   Barger said he has no doubt the man buried at Leavenworth is the
son of Madison Hemings. Records of the cemetery show that William
Hemings served in Company H, 73rd Ohio Volunteer Infantry, a group
of soldiers from Ross County, Ohio. Madison Hemings had lived in
that county, Barger said.
</P>
<P>
   Exhuming Hemings would require a court order, even if
descendants agreed to have it done, said Paul Sherbo, spokesman for
the Department of Veterans Affairs for the region that includes
Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   Barger has sent Banks-Young and other Hemings' descendants forms
to request an exhumation, but said he would not go so far as to
seek a court order.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't do something the family didn't want to do,'' Barger
said. ``If someone else wants to do it, that's up to them.''

 BUSH, MCCAIN TURN UP HEAT IN N. HAMPSHIRE  
 (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KRIS MAYES  
 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   George W. Bush and John Mc Cain blasted away at each other's tax
proposals Tuesday as cam paigning in the ``Live Free or Die'' state
began in earnest.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also rolled out one of his most important endorsements to
date by appearing with Elizabeth Dole, whom he called a ``strong
woman'' who will boost his al ready considerable advantage with
women voters.
</P>
<P>
   With many voters only now tuning in, both Bush and McCain are
campaigning flat-out for the Feb. 1 New Hampshire GOP pri mary, now
just 27 days away.
</P>
<P>
   With the South Carolina GOP primary still more than six weeks
off (on Feb. 19) and the Iowa caucuses in late January reduced in
importance this year, New Hampshire is certain to be the center of
political attention for the rest of the month.
</P>
<P>
   Even as Bush is increasing his attacks on McCain in New Hamp
shire, polls are showing that he may have stopped his downward
slide against his closest competi tor here.
</P>
<P>
   In the American Research Group survey of 600 likely Re publican
voters, conducted Dec. 29-31, McCain led Bush, 36 percent to 33
percent. Taking into account the poll's margin of error (plus or
minus 4 percent age points), the race is once again a statistical
dead heat. In December, the same poll had McCain leading Bush by a
slightly wider margin, 39 percent to 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday was dominated by Dole, whose own presidential dreams
were dashed in part by Bush's huge money advantage. Nevertheless,
Dole likened Bush to Ronald Reagan and vowed to help him round up
the all-impor tant female vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, we rally to another Western governor, just as bold and
challenging to the status quo (as Reagan), just as resolved to
restore pride in our institutions, just as determined to be him
self,'' Dole said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush responded by immedi ately crowning Dole one of his top
campaign surrogates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elizabeth, you have always said that you have been a lieuten
ant in Ronald Reagan's army,'' Bush said. ``I'm proud to have you
(as) a general.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon after, in a meeting with reporters, Bush ripped McCain's
tax package, which will not be released to the public until next
week.
</P>
<P>
   Pointing to what he called ``the tax gap that exists in our posi
tions'' on the tax cuts, Bush criticized McCain's ideas as inad
equate. Left out by McCain's vision, according to Bush, are the
middle class and the working poor.
</P>
<P>
   ``(It) . . . doesn't address the middle class . . . it doesn't
ad dress people who live on the outskirts of poverty,'' Bush said.
``There is a difference of atti tude, a difference of opinion. He
has called my plan too big _ so has Vice President Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   At midday, McCain struck back, saying Bush's plan favors the
rich.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gov. Bush's tax plan has 60 percent of the tax cuts for the
wealthiest 10 percent of Amer ica,'' McCain told reporters be fore
a town hall in Salem. ``I don't think that's necessary. I want the
tax cuts for lower- and middle-income America.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain has said he would direct more of the budget surplus to
saving Social Security than Bush would.
</P>
<P>
   And McCain said he differs from Bush on the subject of Internet
taxes, which he wants to prevent altogether.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, I have a disagree ment with Governor Bush on that
issue,'' McCain said. ``I do not believe that we should harm this
incredible economic engine.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Steve Forbes, god father of the debate over the flat
tax, on Tuesday ridiculed both men's plans as paltry. Campaign ing
on the western border of the state, Forbes told The Arizona
Republic that the tax-conscious New Hampshire electorate ought to
look to him for a genuine tax-cut proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it shows what leader ship does _ by leading on the
issue, the others are following in the wake,'' Forbes said. ``But
they are still nickel-and-diming while I'm at the dollar level.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes said McCain's decision to begin putting together a com
prehensive tax plan shows that ``clearly, he realizes you can't
wing the thing.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's aides said they were not surprised that Bush decided to
take them on but wondered how he could critique a tax plan that has
not yet been released.
</P>
<P>
   ``How does he know what our tax plan is?'' asked Rick Davis,
McCain's campaign manager. ``Is he trying to pick a fight?''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's exchanges lifted the curtain on what will likely be
the basic strategy of the GOP candi dates in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Bush aides say they plan to continue to argue that McCain is
afraid of tax cuts, while McCain's camp says it will hammer away at
Bush's ``irresponsibly'' large tax cut, and Forbes will claim moral
victory for sparking the tax debate in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   All three will also keep educa tion at the forefront of their
electoral strategies and will try to bring more women into their
camps.
</P>
<P>
   McCain continued to barn storm the state that has become his
greatest hope against Bush. His crowds remain large and
enthusiastic.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain sought to keep expectations anchored.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to win in the percep tion of what a win is,'' McCain
said, adding that a second-place finish might be acceptable. ``I
think it's going to be very close, and we have to do very, very
well. If that means a close sec ond, then I think that may be well
enough.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain sloughed off the Dole endorsement despite that it comes
from the wife of the man he tried to help get elected in 1996, Bob
Dole.
</P>
<P>
   ``If (the election) was up to the endorsement game _ and in New
Hampshire, Governor Bush has literally every establishment fig ure
_ we would not be even in the polls with Governor Bush,'' McCain
said.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Emergency rooms, nursing homes and employers are
facing down an odious flu that came late and with a vengeance,
bringing with it a cousin _ a cough and ache-producing, endlessly
protracted bug that is not really flu at all but is perhaps even
more miserable.
</P>
<P>
   From lower Manhattan to the farthest reaches of Queens,
hospitals are reporting that their emergency rooms are flooded with
people complaining of high fevers, hacking coughs, breathing
troubles and dehydration. A shortage of vaccine could make matters
worse, and doctors say New Yorkers are not overly fond of the shots
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``The flu is killing us,'' said Ole Pedersen, a spokesman at
Jamaica Hospital Center in Queens. ``We are up 30 to 35 percent in
the ER, and we are full in house. We are seeing numbers higher than
we have seen before, and there is only a fixed number of beds that
you can put people into.''
</P>
<P>
   New York's influenza outbreak has yet to be characterized by the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as ``widespread,'' a
designation given to states where the flu has settled into nearly
every corner. And hospital administrators say it is still too early
to tell whether the illness, which started to heavily affect
emergency rooms in the last 10 days, will surpass last year's peck
of troubles. States out west are feeling the illness much worse,
CDC officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Each year, the flu prompts an odd epidemiological gamble, played
out among vaccine makers, hospital administrators and patients
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The vaccine makers, who eagerly wait for the CDC to tell them
what strains to attack, must calculate how much vaccine to make.
</P>
<P>
   The science of producing the vaccine is inexact, and this year
the makers were caught shorthanded. For their part, hospital
administrators must staff their wards adequately to deal with an
onslaught, but they do not want too many people on duty in the
event that the outbreak is mild. And New Yorkers must gamble on
whether to get the flu shot at all. Many choose poorly.
</P>
<P>
   Emergency room doctors say that if more people who are
recommended to get vaccines would get them _ mainly people over 65
_ then the emergency rooms would be far less crowded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely not enough people are getting flu shots,'' said Dr.
Joseph Bove, chairman of the emergency room at New York Methodist
Hospital in Brooklyn. ``And now we are getting a rush of people.''
</P>
<P>
   New York state lags behind the rest of the nation in
pneumococcal immunizations, the most important shot for people over
65 who are most prone to serious illnesses that result from a bad
bout with the flu. And in New York City, the numbers are far worse
_ although more than 41 percent of people over 65 got the shot last
year in New York State, only 30 percent of the city's residents
over 65 got it, according to data from Ipro, a nonprofit group that
studies the quality of health care.
</P>
<P>
   ``New York does not lack for lots of fancy doctors,'' said Dr.
John Quinley, who headed the study. ``But it seems to be behind the
curve in comparison in terms of flu vaccine coverage.''
</P>
<P>
   Employers are also feeling the strain. At Bway.net, an Internet
services company in lower Manhattan, a quarter of the 20 staff
members have been out sick in the last few weeks, said James
Durante, the firm's technical support manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people are still coughing,'' Durante said. ``For a couple
of days, we were so short it got a little hectic. People were like,
`Don't cough in my direction.'''

 A DAY IN THE LIFE OF A PC TROUBLE-SHOOTER 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk)

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's 8 a.m. on a recent Wednesday on the Piscataway, N.J.,
campus of Telcordia Technologies, and Jeffrey Horning, one of the
company's 11 troubleshooting computer techies, is waiting for his
first emergency call of the day.
</P>
<P>
   Horning knows there will be plenty of problems that the ``help
desk'' can't fix by phone. Just because Telcordia's stock-in-trade
is technological wizardry _ it provides consulting and engineering
services to the telecommunications industry _ doesn't mean the
2,000 employees at this site alone can't become befuddled at a PC's
refusal to do what it is told. For them, he is more than just a
wizard or, in some cases, a scapegoat; he's also part doctor, part
psychologist and always the diplomat.
</P>
<P>
   While waiting for an electronic ``trouble ticket'' that summons
him to a repair job, the 26-year-old Horning begins loading remote
access software on two PCs that employees have left for him. For
two hours, all is quiet; then, one mini-crisis follows another.
Here are some of the highlights of Horning's day.
</P>
<P>
   10 a.m.: The first trouble ticket for Horning appears on the
screen. An employee who's just been transferred has been trying to
read her mail on someone else's computer. She keeps getting an
error message.
</P>
<P>
   Grabbing the handle of his Microsoft Tech Net Plus CD holder, a
small plastic valise containing some notes and the Microsoft CDs he
brings on each office visit, Horning exits his building, strides
briskly across the street and enters a second office complex, one
of three on the campus.
</P>
<P>
   The woman, Debra Pruitt, is on edge. When she tried to open
Lotus Notes, she says, she got an error message. Well, she adds on
being questioned, she did get one mail message to open but then she
couldn't get a second one. Or, maybe she didn't get the first one
open after all. She looks quizzically at Horning as if beseeching
him to complete her explanation.
</P>
<P>
   He sits down at the computer and searches files, explaining that
since this isn't her regular computer, the mail program doesn't
know where to route her mail. He reinstalls Lotus Notes and
corrects the settings. He gets up, Ms. Pruitt takes his place, and
voila, she can read her mail. She is ecstatic.
</P>
<P>
   12:30 p.m.: A new trouble ticket begins URGENT REQUEST. After
typing a long mail message, Wilma Davis Nurse ran spellcheck and
the screen froze. Another technician can't help her, so Horning
heads across the street to her workstation. Ms. Davis Nurse is
standing next to the original technician in stony silence. When
Horning appears, she pours out her frustration: She has spent hours
composing this message, she tells him, and is desperate not to lose
it. When he scrolls down her computer screen, her radio emits a
staccato sound _electromagnetic interference _ in sync with the
scroll bar. He scrolls up and down in double time, chuckling each
time he produces the static.
</P>
<P>
   The news is not good: There's no auto-recover function, so
there's no way to get the file back, he tells her. If only she had
saved the file at some point, she'd be OK. Her hands fly to her
face. ``I'm having a nervous breakdown,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bet you're going to hit that `save' key from now on,'' he
replies.
</P>
<P>
   1 p.m.: Another trouble ticket lands. Carol Hanawalt tried to
log on to her computer and got an error message indicating an IP
Address conflict, a minor networking problem. Horning talks to a
system administrator and learns a technician who installed a
computer in the morning probably made a typographical error
entering the address. Horning goes to the unsuspecting man's office
and verifies that his computer has the IP address in question. He
fixes the typo. Then he visits Ms. Hanawalt's office and reboots
her computer. Everything is fine. ``Is he good, or what!'' she
demands.
</P>
<P>
   2:30 p.m.: Another ticket, this time from a warehouse operation
that distributes company marketing material. Ernest Madeley can't
call up an order-fulfillment application on his screen. He's
waiting expectantly for Horning, who changes an incorrect hard
drive specification and adds an icon on the desktop display for
easier access.
</P>
<P>
   Before he can reach the door, he's ambushed by another employee.
The system is slow, she complains. Although she is supposed to call
in a trouble ticket first, he sits down at her computer and
immediately identifies the culprit: the screen saver she's using.
Her 486 processor doesn't have enough memory for all the programs
she's running. Just then, Madeley shouts across the room. Now he's
got an error message: ``File is already in use.'' Horning leaves
the woman's PC and walks back across the room. Madeley opened Lotus
Notes a second time; a copy was already running. Horning closes a
copy, which fixes the problem.
</P>
<P>
   He returns to the woman's desk and opens and closes a few
applications. He offers to change some settings so the screen saver
doesn't launch automatically when the PC is booted. She's not
happy, but she lets him do it. He surmises she'll change it back
after he leaves.
</P>
<P>
   4 p.m.: Back in his office, Horning leafs through the latest
Microsoft magazine. It's been a slow day, he says, and nobody has
had to apologize to him for doing something stupid, like the guy a
while back who plugged all the machinery into the power strip but
forgot to plug the power strip into the wall.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the time an employee complained he couldn't hear
his audio CDs playing. Horning's quick inspection revealed that the
computer had no speakers.
</P>
<P>
   But, Horning says, it can get even worse. ``Some people don't
know what it means to reboot a PC,'' he says. And one person, he
added, thought the CD-ROM tray was a cupholder.

issue,'' McCain said. ``I do not believe that we should harm this
incredible economic engine.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Steve Forbes, god father of the debate over the flat
tax, on Tuesday ridiculed both men's plans as paltry. Campaign ing
on the western border of the state, Forbes told The Arizona
Republic that the tax-conscious New Hampshire electorate ought to
look to him for a genuine tax-cut proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it shows what leader ship does _ by leading on the
issue, the others are following in the wake,'' Forbes said. ``But
they are still nickel-and-diming while I'm at the dollar level.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes said McCain's decision to begin putting together a com
prehensive tax plan shows that ``clearly, he realizes you can't
wing the thing.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's aides said they were not surprised that Bush decided to
take them on but wondered how he could critique a tax plan that has
not yet been released.
</P>
<P>
   ``How does he know what our tax plan is?'' asked Rick Davis,
McCain's campaign manager. ``Is he trying to pick a fight?''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's exchanges lifted the curtain on what will likely be
the basic strategy of the GOP candi dates in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Bush aides say they plan to continue to argue that McCain is
afraid of tax cuts, while McCain's camp says it will hammer away at
Bush's ``irresponsibly'' large tax cut, and Forbes will claim moral
victory for sparking the tax debate in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   All three will also keep educa tion at the forefront of their
electoral strategies and will try to bring more women into their
camps.
</P>
<P>
   McCain continued to barn storm the state that has become his
greatest hope against Bush. His crowds remain large and
enthusiastic.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain sought to keep expectations anchored.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to win in the percep tion of what a win is,'' McCain
said, adding that a second-place finish might be acceptable. ``I
think it's going to be very close, and we have to do very, very
well. If that means a close sec ond, then I think that may be well
enough.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain sloughed off the Dole endorsement despite that it comes
from the wife of the man he tried to help get elected in 1996, Bob
Dole.
</P>
<P>
   ``If (the election) was up to the endorsement game _ and in New
Hampshire, Governor Bush has literally every establishment fig ure
_ we would not be even in the polls with Governor Bush,'' McCain
said.

WHAT ABOUT RETURNS AND REFUNDS ON Y2K SUPPLIES? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 BY FINN BULLERS  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Nobody is worried about Y2K anymore, but you
may have a new concern: what to do with the extra flashlights you
bought, the pinto beans you stocked in the basement and that new
electrical generator sitting in the garage.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that in most instances you can return the
hardware _ as long as you did not use it first.
</P>
<P>
   As for the food, at least one agency would be grateful if you
donated it _ even those pinto beans.
</P>
<P>
   From Jan. 15 to Feb. 15, Harvesters-The Community Food Network
will participate in a nationwide food drive sponsored by America's
Second Harvest, which helps supply 50,000 local charities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no way of gauging how many people have stockpiled or
to what extent,'' said Valerie Nicholson-Watson, director of
community services for the Kansas City food pantry. ``But we're
crossing our fingers and hoping we'll get substantial donations.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially needed are canned goods and packaged foods,
Nicholson-Watson said.
</P>
<P>
   Harvesters, like several food banks in the country, says it had
not seen a major increase in donations yet, but it is still early.
Donations traditionally drop off sharply after the holidays.
</P>
<P>
   In Kansas City, convenient donation drop-off points are needed,
drive organizers say. So far the Price Chopper stores have agreed
to serve as collection sites.
</P>
<P>
   Businesses that would like to help can call Kimberly Cason at
(816) 231-3173, Ext. 144, or contact Harvesters through the
Internet at www.harvesters.com
</P>
<P>
   With your other Y2K buys, retailers in Kansas City seem
forgiving.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our policy is that as long as they have a receipt and it's not
been used and it's in the package and it's resellable, we accept
returns,'' said Mike Wolf, manager of the Westlake Ace Hardware
store on State Avenue in Kansas City, Kan..
</P>
<P>
   Batteries, flashlights, storage units and even high-ticket items
like propane heaters and generators can be returned to the 19
Westlake Ace Hardware stores in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Westlake has not seen a lot of people making returns on
emergency Y2K items. Neither has Wal-Mart nor Target, spokesmen
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've sold a lot of water and a lot of batteries, and we
haven't had to take any of it back,'' said Craig Calvert, Kansas
City, North, Target manager. ``I'm a little surprised.''
</P>
<P>
   The six Target stores in the Kansas City area had braced for a
slew of returns and had a plan in place for extra staff to restock
items. The plan even called for stores to take back bottled water,
as long as it still was in sealed containers.
</P>
<P>
   Sears expected so many returns of generators that it had sought
to protect manufacturers by establishing a 25 percent restocking
fee, based on the price of the generator.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Tim Hoyer, operations manager at the Bannister Road
store, said he had not seen any returned generators.
</P>
<P>
   Customers at the 10 area Home Depot stores can expect to get
their money back for any Y2K items they may have purchased.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did see a slight increase in generator sales,'' said
Gladstone store manager Tom Bamford. ``But so far, we've seen no
returns.''
</P>
<P>
   That, says company spokesman Tom Gray, was because the bulk of
generator sales is attributable to seasonal factors rather than
Y2K.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of hype was given to Y2K,'' Gray said. ``And people have
reasons other than Y2K to buy batteries and generators.''

CLOSING THE GAP IN STATE SCHOOL SPENDING 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By RICHARD ROTHSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For nearly 30 years, state courts have ordered more equitable
spending between school districts. Yet this within-state focus has
meant that an even greater inequality has been ignored: the
difference in education expenditure between rich and poor states.
New Jersey, for example, spends two and a half times as much per
pupil as Mississippi. In general, even after within-state spending
has been equalized, poor districts in rich states spend much more
than rich districts in poor states.
</P>
<P>
   It has been difficult to address this problem because education
is largely a state and local concern, with federal dollars
accounting for only about 7 percent of school spending. Proposals
to increase that role have become enmeshed in partisan arguments.
Democrats typically want to increase spending for specific purposes
like smaller classes, while Republicans resist the loss of local
control that comes with federal dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a proposal that should satisfy both parties: Use federal
money to subsidize states lacking the means to support adequate
schools. This could add up to a new federal civil rights mission _
giving poor states (many with large minority populations) the
possibility of having good school systems like rich states.
</P>
<P>
   It would mean an increase in federal education spending that
liberals want. But to address conservative concerns about meddling
from Washington, the money should come with no strings attached.
Poor states with subsidies should not be asked to follow federal
rules any more than rich states that would not be dependent on
federal money.
</P>
<P>
   To make the plan work requires an adjustment for price
differences between states. For example, New Jersey spent $9,700
per pupil in 1996 (the most recent year for which comparative data
is available), while Mississippi spent only $3,700. But living
costs are lower in Mississippi. It costs less to hire a good
teacher there than in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   A precise calculation of such disparities is impossible because
the dollar's relative purchasing power in different places cannot
easily be measured. But we can make estimates with formulas used by
business groups to calculate cost-of-living allowances for
executives moving from place to place. Such estimates show that the
real spending gap is smaller, but still quite large: In ``New
Jersey dollars,'' Mississippi spent $4,900 per student in 1996, not
$3,700.
</P>
<P>
   Because it costs more to educate poor children, subsidies should
also be adjusted for a state's poverty. Let's assume that a poor
child's education needs 50 percent more money. We can then
recalculate per-pupil spending, counting each poor child as ``one
and a half children.'' On this basis, New Jersey (where 14 percent
of the children were poor) spent $9,200, compared with only $3,300
in Mississippi (where 26 percent were poor).
</P>
<P>
   Such gaps do not primarily result from the value a state places
on education. Mississippi has less capacity to finance schools, no
matter how much it wants to do so. In 1996, total
personal-income-per-child in New Jersey was $247,000; in
Mississippi it was only $62,000 (again, in ``New Jersey dollars'').
But some other states may spend little, though they can afford to
do more. So Congress should also adjust for a state's capacity to
provide for its own needs. States with high income-per-child should
not receive grants, even if their per-pupil spending is low.
</P>
<P>
   If the plan aims to bring poor states' spending up to the level
of the average state, it could cost $20 billion a year. Federal
spending for pre-college education is now about $20 billion, so if
no existing programs were replaced, this could double federal
school spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``Small-government conservatives'' may resist this plan because
it would increase the education budgets of the federal government
and of poor states. But government should be no more limited in
poor states than in rich ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big-spending liberals'' may resist because they prefer to tell
states how to spend federal dollars. But subsidized states should
not be subject to more federal control than states where, because
of low poverty or high wealth, federal aid is not needed.
</P>
<P>
   A well-designed program would distribute grants to states like
Mississippi and New Mexico but probably not Florida because,
despite having many poor children, its retired residents give it
relatively high personal income per child.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, California probably should receive a grant
because, despite relatively high wealth, it has even higher
relative numbers of children, many of whom are poor.
</P>
<P>
   Bringing spending in poor states up to an adequate level should
be a federal role on which everyone can agree. This will not solve
all the problems in our nation's schools, but it addresses one too
long ignored.

MAN WHO KILLED HIS NEWBORN SON RELEASED FROM PRISON 
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Del.) (nk) 
 By ROBERT HANLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WYCKOFF, N.J. _ A man convicted in the death of his newborn son
at a Delaware motel in November 1996 was released from prison
Tuesday after serving 18 months of a two-year sentence.
</P>
<P>
   The man, Brian C. Peterson, 21, expressed both remorse and
gratitude after returning in midmorning to his mother's brick home
here. He visited about an hour with family members, played with his
pet cat, Princess, fed his tropical fish and then emerged to read a
four-sentence statement. He seemed pale, drawn and subdued.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want everyone to know how sorry I am for my part in the
tragic events that occurred three years ago,'' he said in his only
reference to a widely publicized crime that grew out of a futile
effort by Peterson and his high school sweetheart, Amy S.
Grossberg, to keep her pregnancy and the birth of their child
secret.
</P>
<P>
   After the baby was born in a motel in Newark, Del., near Ms.
Grossberg's dormitory at the University of Delaware, Peterson put
the infant in a plastic bag and discarded it in a trash bin. Ms.
Grossberg collapsed in her dormitory room hours later. Within a
day, she and Peterson, both then 18 and just weeks into their first
year of college, were arrested and charged with killing the baby.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, Delaware prosecutors talked of seeking the death
penalty against them. But the two teen-agers said they believed the
baby was stillborn, and eventually prosecutors allowed them to
plead guilty to manslaughter.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Grossberg received a 30-month sentence, six months' more
than Peterson, in July 1998. She could be eligible for parole in
June.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson's sentence included 300 hours of community service. His
lawyers, Russell M. Gioiella and Jack T. Litman of Manhattan, said
he wants to fulfill some of that obligation by counseling
teen-agers in high school and clinics on the responsibilities of
parenthood.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   They said their client was eager to start advising teen-agers
confronted with unexpected and unwanted pregnancies to tell their
parents and seek medical and professional help.
</P>
<P>
   ``They tried to deal with a horrible situation by themselves,''
Litman said of Peterson and Ms. Grossberg. ``Now, he happens to
have a very legitimate conscience.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Gioiella said. ``He made a serious mistake, and he has matured a
lot by tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   Peterson said he was happy to be reunited with his family. He
also thanked the ``many people'' he said had offered him sympathy
and support.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can assure everyone that I will reward their confidence in
me and make them proud of me in the future,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson's lawyers said he has not spoken to Ms. Grossberg in
months and has no plans to attempt to contact her in the future.
Their romance ended in bitter recrimination in the Delaware courts
in early 1998.

GIULIANI CHIDES MRS. CLINTON FOR SEEKING SOFT MONEY 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani chastised Hillary Rodham
Clinton Tuesday for aggressively soliciting contributions to a
political action committee that will support her campaign for
United States Senate, a strategy designed to get around the legal
limits on contributions to individual candidates.
</P>
<P>
   But in repeating his criticism of Mrs. Clinton and her
Democratic supporters, Giuliani again left open the possibility
that he, too, would use the largely unregulated campaign
contributions known as soft money if, as expected, he runs against
the first lady this year. ``I learned a long time ago that you
don't tie one hand behind your back,'' Giuliani said at his daily
news conference. ``That isn't the way you win.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, The New York Times reported that national Democratic
Party officials had set up political action committees to channel
large, unregulated contributions to Senate campaigns in New York,
California, Florida, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan and
Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, The Washington Post reported that one of those
committees, the one designed to help Mrs. Clinton, called New York
Senate 2000, had raised more than $360,000, much of it in large
contributions from a few wealthy people and corporations.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Party officials, who first initiated this method of
fund-raising two years ago, have established two such committees to
help Senate candidates in Missouri and Pennsylvania. Party
officials said they might also start a similar committee to assist
Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said he might accept the help. ``I believe you have to
be competitive,'' he said. ``I intend to get my message out. I
intend to have enough money to do that, and the other campaign has
already started using soft money big time, without any penalty,
without any stopping of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The race for the New York Senate seat is likely to be the
costliest Senate contest in state history, with Mrs. Clinton's side
having projected months ago that it hoped to raise $25 million and
Giuliani's aides predicting that they would need $20 million.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton has challenged Giuliani to agree to limit the
amount of soft money used in the Senate race. But Giuliani and his
aides have scoffed at that challenge, observing that the national
and state Democratic committees have already paid for campaign
commercials for Mrs. Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Wolfson, the spokesman for Mrs. Clinton's campaign,
repeated the challenge Tuesday in response to the Mayor's
criticism. ``Why hasn't the Mayor responded to Hillary's proposal
last month to limit soft money and independent expenditures from
the race?'' Wolfson said.

2 BROOKLYN LAWYERS OUTLINE A COURT PATRONAGE SYSTEM 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By ALAN FEUER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ According to Kings County lore, the political
clubhouse in Brooklyn has long been connected to the county
courthouse, allowing lawyers with strong political ties to win
lucrative legal assignments.
</P>
<P>
   Although party leaders have consistently denied that such a
patronage mill exists, a remarkably candid letter written last
month has opened a revealing window on the back-room dealings among
Brooklyn lawyers and leaders of the borough's Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   The letter was written on Dec. 20 by two top party officials,
Arnold J. Ludwig and Thomas J. Garry, to announce their
resignations from the law committee of the Brooklyn Democratic
Party. In a rare display of candor, it tacitly acknowledged that
the legal patronage system was healthily in place, as the two men,
both lawyers, complained about being frozen out of lucrative court
work despite ``unquestioned loyalty'' to the party.
</P>
<P>
   For years, court watchdog groups have complained about the close
ties among party leaders, lawyers and elected Supreme Court
justices in Brooklyn and other boroughs, and have worried about the
potential for favoritism.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic leaders select who will run for Civil Court
judgeships on the party slate, which is tantamount to election in
the heavily Democratic borough. Those judges are then responsible
for appointing lawyers to serve as receivers, managing failed
business ventures like properties that have been foreclosed. The
receivers often have ties to the party leadership, and they in turn
can hire other lawyers _ often with ties to the party leadership _
to help with the legal work.
</P>
<P>
   What makes the letter by Ludwig and Garry so incendiary is that
it not only hints at the connections between party loyalty and
legal business in Brooklyn, but also names specific players in the
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``The letter is radioactive,'' said one elected Democrat in
Brooklyn who insisted that his name be withheld. ``This is an
invitation to an investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   The letter makes no mention of judges or of specific court
appointments. But in it, the two men say they decided to quit the
party law committee because they had effectively been cut out of
lucrative work by another Brooklyn lawyer named Ravi Batra.
</P>
<P>
   Batra has worked as a fund-raiser for the Brooklyn Democratic
Party, whose chairman, Clarence Norman Jr., serves as an ``of
counsel'' lawyer, an advisory position, in Batra's law firm.
</P>
<P>
   According to the state Office of Court Administration, over the
last five years Batra has been granted many receiverships. He, in
turn, frequently retained Garry's and Ludwig's law firm as his
adviser in managing these affairs _ until Dec. 7, when, according
to the letter, he fired them and hired his own firm to handle the
legal work associated with the receiverships. By doing so, the
letter says, Batra sought to put in his pocket both the commissions
from his receiverships and the legal fees generated from them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is unprecedented and disheartening how one man's greed and
self-absorption can go so unchecked,'' the letter said.
</P>
<P>
   Batra, Ludwig and Garry did not return several phone calls
Tuesday seeking comment. Nor did Michael M. Freeman, chairman of
the law committee, to whom the letter was addressed. The letter
surfaced after copies were sent to more than 40 Brooklyn Democratic
district leaders and other party officials.
</P>
<P>
   But in a telephone interview Tuesday night, Norman vigorously
denied that there was a court patronage scheme in place. And he
said there was nothing wrong with the fact that a lawyer with ties
to him frequently gets receivership work, even though Norman
himself holds great sway over which judges end up being elected.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a county organization, we help qualified people get elected
to the bench,'' Norman said. ``But once they're elected, we don't
tell them who to give assignments to. I don't speak to judges or
anyone else in regards to giving cases to Batra.''
</P>
<P>
   The Brooklyn District Attorney's office said Tuesday that it
could not comment on the legality of such appointments.
Nonetheless, a spokesman, Kevin Davitt, said his office was
referring the issue to the New York State Grievance Committee, an
arm of the state's Appellate Division.
</P>
<P>
   But Edward S. Reich, chairman of the judiciary committee for the
Brooklyn Bar Association, criticized Batra's practice of hiring his
own law firm to handle receiverships. ``It's improper,'' he said.
``You just can't do that.''

<P>
   In high school, I wanted to be a history teacher. My favorite
teacher, Batchelder, had us read the Federalist papers and
newspaper articles from the 1780s, not some boring textbook. He
made history come alive.
</P>
<P>
   But those were the days when a son did what his father told him
to. My father said: ``Well, technology is coming up. We've got
these new IBM machines, Sputnik has just gone up.'' He wanted me to
be an engineer. He figured I'd be able to do anything if I mastered
technology. He told me to go to MIT, so I went.
</P>
<P>
   I was a terrible engineer. The most painful part was twice
failing my fourth semester of physics, a required course. The
second time, I had already been accepted at Harvard, and my
motivation was a little weak. I was granted a waiver. I was a class
officer and I had the role of handing the diplomas to the president
at the graduation ceremony. They didn't have a backup, and I guess
they figured they couldn't have me up there doing that and not give
me my diploma.
</P>
<P>
   To this day, my eyes still roll when I hear the word
``physics.''
</P>
<P>
   Arrow Electronics is the world's largest distributor of
electronic and computer products. We keep track of 200,000 parts.
Actually, it's 500,000, but people don't believe that, so I say
200,000. We've been No. 1 for five years now. But I've made my
share of mistakes. In 1984 or so, after I had been here two or
three years, I decided to reorganize one of the departments. On
paper, it was the right decision, but I had neglected to ask for
input from the people affected. They didn't want to do it; they
wouldn't do it. So I pushed harder, I held big meetings, I exhorted
the troops. Things just got worse. A colleague said, ``They're not
buying it.'' I took a long walk. And then I back-pedaled.
</P>
<P>
   The lesson: Even a committed and knowledgeable CEO can't just
dictate something. You have to listen.
</P>
<P>
   I try not to explode in public. But when mechanical things don't
work, I lose it. I once pulled a telephone out of a wall. Another
time, I picked up a printer that wasn't printing and deposited it
on the other side of the room in one fluid motion. This happened in
the privacy of my office. The door was open, but thank heaven,
nobody was watching. My secretary heard the thunk. She asked me,
``Shall I ask maintenance to bring you another printer?''
</P>
<P>
   I also get angry when people make the same mistake a third time
or a fourth time. But I don't lose it; I go into my teaching mode.
I say: ``John, I know you want to do it this way. But Bill and Sue
and Mary and George have all tried to do it that way, and they all
failed.'' You try to get people to come to the right conclusion
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   I should know. In 1987, I took a sabbatical to teach at the
Harvard Business School. Based on what I learned when I was
teaching, I came back to Arrow with a revised business strategy.
</P>
<P>
   I have some other operating principles. Ignore the chain of
command. Cultivate people who will disagree with you. And beware of
the managerial fad of the year, especially if it is known by three
letters.

HOUSTON'S 37 POINTS SPARK KNICKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The serenity of Allan Houston's smooth shooting
performance was the perfect elixir to calm the Knicks' jangled
nerves caused by the frenetic-paced Celtics Tuesday night at
Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Each time the Celtics threatened to unnerve the Knicks, there
was the soothing touch of Houston. He scored a season-high 37
points, including 14 in the fourth quarter, as the Knicks sent the
Celtics to their 15th straight loss at Madison Square Garden with a
96-88 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Twice, the Celtics closed to 3 points of the Knicks (19-12) in
the last six minutes of the game and each time Houston delivered a
3-pointer to stop the momentum of the Celtics (13-17). In the end,
it was the Celtics who came unglued and became frustrated by every
Houston field goal. In the last 3 minutes 22 seconds of the game,
the Celtics scored only 3 points after cutting their deficit to
87-85.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics were led by Paul Pierce (23 points) and Kenny
Anderson (22 points), while Houston (12 for 18) carried the Knicks
with the help of 16 points from Latrell Sprewell and 14 points and
12 rebounds from Patrick Ewing. The Knicks won despite turning the
ball over 18 times.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics arrived with the ability to expose every Knicks
weakness. The Knicks have had trouble guarding the dribble, and the
Celtics had Anderson to drive the ball into the paint past Charlie
Ward. The Knicks have had difficulty rebounding, and the Celtics
had an active Danny Fortson to jump in front of Ewing. The Knicks
have generally wilted under ball pressure, and the Celtics came
with the reputation of pressing more than any other team in the
East.
</P>
<P>
   With a four-day break to steel themselves against the Celtics,
the Knicks came out with the right mind-set: do unto others before
they do in you. The Knicks were the aggressors on defense and
focused on offense as they built a 13-point, first-quarter lead.
</P>
<P>
   But once the Celtics began turning the pressure back onto the
Knicks _ which resulted in 7 second-quarter turnovers _ and once
they began to penetrate inside to pick up layups and free-throw
opportunities, the tone of the game changed.
</P>
<P>
   The Celtics, down by 12 points with 9:41 left in the half, went
on a 23-10 run to end the second quarter with a 50-49 lead. Instead
of reacting with an edge, the Knicks came out in the third quarter
and began settling for jump shots. That plan left the Knicks
shooting 1 for 8 from the field in the first five minutes and left
them down, 58-53.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks shook up their thinking and started being assertive
again. Suddenly, they were back on top, 59-58, with 5:41 left in
the third quarter after a jumper by Houston, a driving layup by
Sprewell and a post move from Larry Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Then Sprewell, on one of the niftiest plays of the night, raced
down the floor on the break and delivered a line-drive alley-oop
pass to Marcus Camby, who handled the pass and the finger roll all
at once to put the Knicks up, 66-63, with 3:45 left in the period.
</P>
<P>
   But for every flashy moment the Knicks delivered, there was a
lapse on the other end. By the end of the third quarter, Camby was
sitting with his fifth foul, the Knicks had turned the ball over in
the final 20 seconds and the Celtics were behind by 71-70 entering
the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams went through spurts of brilliance to counter their
lulls from the beginning. What had been working so well for the
Knicks in the first quarter broke down in the second.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson started slipping by the Knicks' point guard twosome of
Ward and Chris Childs and scored 15 first-half points. And after
Sprewell had begun the game by torturing Pierce with his pull-up
jumpers, Pierce began to turn the momentum of the matchup around by
driving to the basket and launching his own pull-up jumpers for 19
first-half points.
</P>
<P>
   At first, the Knicks seemed invincible. Playing unselfishly and
with Ward guiding the way (7 points and 2 assists), the Knicks were
finding every open man and shot 70 percent in the first quarter.
After containing Anderson during the first quarter, and helping his
team build a lead as big as 13 points, Ward had one lapse: he let
Anderson spring free for a 3-pointer at the first-quarter buzzer to
pull the Celtics to 33-25. &QL;

ITALIAN BOAT IS LATEST VICTIM IN CHALLENGER SERIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUCKLAND, New Zealand _ What began with a thrill at the start
soon ended with a bang and with expensive fragments of carbon
flying through the clear skies above the Hauraki Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   Equipment has been the big loser since the America's Cup
challenger series began in Auckland months ago, and not just the
split hull of former contender Young America. There have been many
technical problems, many breakdowns, and Wednesday's high-profile,
well-funded victim was the Prada Challenge.
</P>
<P>
   In the middle of gaining ground against America One on the first
leg of their race in this semifinal round, the Italian boat's mast
snapped in half, putting a stunningly quick end to the duel.
</P>
<P>
   Prada, whose $50 million budget is the biggest of the six
semifinalists, had been one of the few syndicates to escape major
damage here as it put together the best record of the challengers
in the three preliminary rounds. But it now has a losing record
(1-2) in this six-team semifinal round, which will winnow the field
to two for the right to challenge New Zealand next month.
</P>
<P>
   And as skipper Paul Cayard and his San Francisco-based crew of
America One sailed the final five legs of the course alone, Prada's
boat, ITA-45, was towed back to the Viaduct Basin, looking more
like a square-rigged junk than an America's Cup sloop, with its
sail folded on top of itself on the now-truncated mast.
</P>
<P>
   What made the snapped mast all the more surprising was that the
weather bore little resemblance to Monday's squall-filled, windy
conditions or to the more daunting conditions on Tuesday that
forced racing to be canceled. When the first of Wednesday's three
races began, the wind was blowing at approximately 11 knots, and
when Prada's mast snapped in the midst of a starboard tack in
slightly choppy conditions, it had increased very little and was
well within the safety guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   ``There must have been a flaw in something there,'' Cayard said.
``It wasn't that windy, about 15 knots. I don't know if it was a
defect or them pushing the design. They are pushing pretty hard on
the Prada boat to keep everything light. They have thin rigging;
they are really into reduction. Maybe they pushed it a bit too
hard.''
</P>
<P>
   According to a Prada spokesman, the mast gave way because of a
broken starboard stay, one of the long vertical cables that runs
from the deck to the top of the mast.
</P>
<P>
   The Italians have a spare rig and should be able to make repairs
in time to face Le Defi Francais here on Thursday. But with seven
races remaining, they will have to regain momentum in a hurry after
losing to Stars and Stripes on Monday, when ITA-45 suffered damage
to its boom vang.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, Stars and Stripes is the team with momentum.
Dennis Conner's syndicate built its single boat very late in
comparison with its contenders, but it is now 3-0 after defeating
Le Defi Francais on Wednesday by the very convincing margin of 3
minutes 6 seconds. Le Defi is now 0-3 but in the relatively light
wind conditions Wednesday, it was expected to give Stars and
Stripes a stronger challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it caused itself difficulties from the start by
entering the start zone before the five-minute countdown had begun,
thereby incurring a penalty. After losing the start to Stars and
Stripes, it then incurred a second penalty after the boats collided
near the end of the first leeward leg.
</P>
<P>
   Though Le Defi technically had the right of way _ it was to
starboard _ it was penalized for altering course and not allowing
Stars and Stripes to escape the collision, which damaged the stern
of the boat.
</P>
<P>
   America One is now 2-1, as is Nippon Challenge, which defeated
the other San Francisco-based challenger, America True, by 1:31
despite a rare loss at the start. America True is 1-2; its victory
came on Monday when America One broke its jib halyard with a big
lead and was unable to fly a jib for the remainder of the race.
</P>
<P>
   But America One was considerably luckier Wednesday, particularly
at the start, where a bold jibe through a desperately tight space
near the committee boat gave it a 10-second lead over Prada, a lead
that, as it turned out, it would not need to get a valuable point.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess we feel a little less guilty about winning the race
like this because of what happened to us the other day,'' Cayard
said.

ITALY TO OPEN DIPLOMATIC RELATIONS WITH NORTH KOREA 
</HEADLINE>
  (SUBS to rewrite lede for precision.) 
(mk) 
 By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ To help end North Korea's isolation, Italy announced
Tuesday that it was opening diplomatic relations with the hard-line
Communist nation, becoming the first member of the Group of Seven
industrial nations to do so.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement marked a significant shift in North Korea's
relationship with the rest of the world. North Korea, sometimes
known as the ``hermit nation,'' has long held out complete
self-reliance as part of its state ideology. But natural disasters
and the failure of its collective farming policy in recent years
caused widespread famine, forcing the government to accept foreign
aid and some kind of relationship with the West. Last month, Japan
lifted sanctions against North Korea, a step that was seen as a
preparatory step for normalizing relations.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's announcement took North Korea a full step further.
</P>
<P>
   ``This happened as a conjunction of the West's need to end North
Korea's dangerous isolation, and North Korea's need to feed
itself,'' an Italian Foreign Ministry official, who asked not to be
identified, explained.
</P>
<P>
   The Italian government is not, however, the first European
country to open diplomatic relations with North Korea. Sweden,
Denmark, Finland, Austria and Portugal have taken the step. But
Italy is the first member of the Group of Seven industrial nations
to do so, and took the lead among them almost as a point of foreign
policy pride.
</P>
<P>
   ``Italy can and does serve as an icebreaker in international
affairs,'' the Italian official said. ``It's the Dini doctrine.''
He was referring to Lamberto Dini, Italy's foreign minister, who
recently brokered reconciliation pacts with two other rogue
nations, Iran and Libya. Italy had strong economic ties to those
two countries, which have rich oil resources. So far, at least,
Rome has negligible trade with North Korea.
</P>
<P>
   James Rubin, the State Department spokesman, responded Tuesday
by saying, ``Our view has been that each country has to make its
own decision on how to proceed toward a more normal relationship
with North Korea, as North Korea meets the international
community's concerns on the nuclear and the missile front.''
</P>
<P>
   Italian government officials said that they had informed the
United States and South Korea of their overtures to the North
Koreans in advance, and that they received full support. ``The West
realizes that an isolated North Korea, with its nuclear potential
and missile technology, poses a real risk,'' the Foreign Ministry
official said.
</P>
<P>
   He said that Dini had discussed his overtures with Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright during a conference in Florence in
October. He raised it with his South Korean counterpart at a
gathering in Istanbul, Turkey, in November. ``Italy has been trying
to bring North Korea back to ordinary business for some time,'' the
Foreign Ministry official said. ``But it is not an isolated policy.
It is a widely shared strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   Dini met Tuesday with Kim Hung Rim, North Korea's representative
to the Food and Agriculture Organization, a U.N. agency based in
Rome. After the meeting, Kim told Reuters, ``We will do all that is
possible to develop and intensify bilateral relations and
cooperation and exchanges in the international community.''
</P>
<P>
   He said a decision on whether the North Korean mission to the
Food and Agriculture Organization could be upgraded to embassy
status would be made ``as soon as possible.'' The Italian Foreign
Ministry said it would use its Beijing mission as a conduit for
relations with North Korea.

LANDRY IN HOSPITAL; CONDITION UNKNOWN

<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Former Dallas Cowboys coach Tom Landry, who underwent
treatment for leukemia at Baylor University Medical Center as
recently as November, is back in the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The hospital released a brief statement Tuesday, but declined to
disclose the reason for Landry's return or other details about his
condition and treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Currently, coach Tom Landry is at Baylor University Medical
Center and is receiving treatment,'' the statement said. ``At the
family's request, no additional information is being released.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Myers, an assistant coach for the Cowboys from 1962-86, said
he was told by a family member Tuesday that Landry had an infection
and it was ``under control.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's getting along pretty good,'' Myers said. ``Well,
they still haven't gotten the thing in remission. That's the
biggest problem they've had all along.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anybody can eventually pull it out, it'll be him.''
</P>
<P>
   Landry, 75, who led the Cowboys to a record 20 consecutive
winning seasons in his 29 years as head coach, is fighting chronic
myelogenous leukemia, a disease that impairs the production of red
blood cells.
</P>
<P>
   He underwent a first round of chemotherapy treatments in May. In
August tests revealed that the disease had been brought to the
state of temporary remission, but that more treatments were
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Landry was hospitalized in November for chemotherapy as his
family fended off news reports that he was gravely ill. He returned
home by Thanksgiving, and continued receiving treatments as an
outpatient. Landry's wife, Alicia, said then that he was not in
pain and was able to take walks.
</P>
<P>
   Landry, the third-winningest coach in NFL history, guided Dallas
to five Super Bowls and two championships from the team's inception
in 1960 until Jerry Jones fired him after the 1988 season.
</P>
<P>
   His record over 29 seasons was 270-178-6. He was inducted into
the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1990. nn

HARPER FITS IN WELL WITH LAKERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE DILBECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Lakers guard Ron Harper knows what all those old
Clippers faithful were thinking when they caught his act Tuesday
night at Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're saying, `He's old. His game is gone. He can't move,'
'' Harper said.
</P>
<P>
   Harper can smile at this, a happy and contented smile. Win three
NBA titles and feel like you now have a strong chance for a fourth,
and you're allowed a little self-satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
   Yet this incarnation of Harper is a long ways from the player
who once averaged over 20 points per game for the Clippers, who was
once one of the best scoring guards in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't fly anymore,'' Harper said. ``I don't shoot the
ball.''
</P>
<P>
   This is also the player who described his time with the Clippers
like being in jail. A free agent in 1994, he signed with the Bulls
and immediately underwent one of the more amazing playing
transformations imaginable.
</P>
<P>
   His last year with the Clippers, he averaged 20.1 points per
game. His first year with Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen &AMP; Co., he
averaged 6.9 points per game. And was still a key factor.
</P>
<P>
   Harper went from being the key player on the Clippers, to the
ultimate role player with the Bulls. And Phil Jackson, then the
Bulls coach, thought he had acquired another scorer.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got there, Phil asked me how I was going to fit in,''
Harper said. ``I told him my job was to play defense. He said,
`!ital!what?!off!'
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't think I knew how to change my game, but I showed
him. I had to find a spot on that team, and the only way to be out
there was to play defense. With that team, the shots weren't
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Blessed with a long 6-foot-6 frame and a good court sense,
Harper made a smooth transition. One that has probably prolonged
his career. Now he plays tough defense, rebounds, hands out assists
and scores in the flow. A lot the things many overlook in this era
of flashy sports show replays.
</P>
<P>
   It's a supporting role he's brought to the Lakers with
remarkable ease. Reunited with Jackson, Harper has quickly fit in
and helped the Lakers break out to the best record in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   Harper has started all 31 games for the Lakers, averaging 7.4
points per game, only sixth on the team. Yet he and Derek Fisher
lead the team in assists, he's third in steals and tied with Robert
Horry for third in rebounding.
</P>
<P>
   Harper, who turns 36 on Jan. 20 and still bothered by a bad
right knee, is like the crafty left-hander who has lost his
fastball but figured out other ways to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not surprised, Ron is a very smart basketball player,''
said Lakers assistant coach Jim Cleamons, who was an assistant in
Chicago when Harper first joined the Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very athletic and has a great court sense. With his knee,
he's not what he used to be. But on any given night, he can still
get to the cup and make things happen. If he had to, he could crank
it up to 14, 15 points a night.''
</P>
<P>
   All Harper knows is, he's still playing, owns three rings and is
position for more. Whether the Clippers fans recognized him Tuesday
or not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fans understand when you take the ball to the hole, rise over
guys,'' Harper said. ``That's my old style. Now I do the things
that fans don't always see.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen some great players average a lot of points, but
never win anything. I'm a team player in a team game. I wouldn't
change my job with anyone.''
