New Mexico Fire Still Rages
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   LOS ALAMOS, N.M. (AP) -- Although blowtorch winds and searing heat that fed a
raging Los Alamos wildfire broke Friday, the fire remained out of control in the
nearby forests and canyons, and residents were told they could not return to
their houses for at least a week. The fire, which began with a
government-prescribed burn to clear brush, damaged the town's nuclear weapons
laboratory and forced 25,000 people to flee. The weapon lab appeared out of
danger today, and all of the facility's major buildings were unscathed, said
Richard Burick, deputy lab director for operations.

Midwest Storms Kill Two, Injure Dozens
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   DUNKERTON, Iowa (AP) -- A quickly moving storm spawned tornadoes, high winds
and baseball-sized hail from Texas to Michigan Friday, killing one person in
Texas and injuring at least two dozen others. A 4-year-old Kansas girl died
earlier in the day in aftermath of a tornado. One person died in Hill County,
about 60 miles south of Dallas, when a twister touched down Friday evening, said
Cpl. Charlie Morgan with the Texas Department of Public Safety. The storm ripped
roofs off houses and flipped mobile homes as the storm moved through. In St.
Nazianz, Wis., straight-line wind gusts up to 110 mph and baseball-size hail
caused heavy damage to a mobile home park Friday night, where several people
were injured.

Ethiopia, Eritrea Fighting Again
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) -- Ignoring international pleas to end their
two-year border conflict, Ethiopia and Eritrea returned to open war on Friday
with fighting reported on three fronts. U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
predicted ''a very brutal war,'' and expressed frustration that peace efforts
had failed. The two sides issued contradictory statements on the details of the
fighting, but both agreed that war had erupted once again along the 620-mile
frontier, which contains a now-evacuated stretch of fertile land of great value
in this drought-wracked region of Africa. The U.N. Security Council demanded the
two countries immediately stop fighting and hinted at a possible arms embargo if
Africa's newest war doesn't dissipate over the weekend.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton Friday announced grants to develop

Gore acknowledged that he often voted with the National Rifle Association during
his early years in Congress, but they have parted ways. Bush and Gore sat down
for interviews on morning television shows, raising their voices on one of the
most volatile issues of the presidential campaign season. Recent polls show
voters split between Gore and Bush on whom they trust on gun policies.

Even Cheap Drugs May Not Aid Africa
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) -- A plan by pharmaceutical companies to
reduce sharply the price of AIDS drugs was greeted Friday as a sign of progress
-- but one that will have little impact on most of those infected. Five major
drug companies announced in Geneva on Thursday they would work with governments
in Africa and other poor regions to cut the overall costs of HIV/AIDS drugs by a
reported 70 to 85 percent. However, few countries in sub-Saharan Africa, where
70 percent of the world's 33.6 million HIV-infected people live, have the
resources to provide any large-scale programs to their infected populations.

Heat Defeat Knicks 77-76 in OT
</SUBHEAD>

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Anthony Carter's incredible shot from behind the backboard

<HEADLINE> Philippine Rebels Reopen Contact  </HEADLINE>
By JIM GOMEZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOLO, Philippines (AP) -- Muslim rebels holding 21 hostages in
the Philippine jungle said Saturday that they would consider
releasing two ailing captives.
</P>
<P>
   The Abu Sayyaf rebels' willingness to consider the release
appeared to be a positive shift from a day earlier, when the
guerrillas had decided against freeing them, said a negotiator, who
spoke on the condition he not be named.
</P>
<P>
   Abdul Rajab Azzarouq, a former Libyan ambassador to the
Philippines who is helping negotiate, left Jolo city Saturday to
meet with the rebels to follow up on the possible release, the
negotiator said.
</P>
<P>
   Contacts with the rebels, broken since Wednesday, were
re-established Friday night when the separatist guerrillas
delivered seven letters their captives had written to loved ones.
</P>
<P>
   Azzarouq called the delivery of letters written by the hostages
to their loved ones ''a gesture which I hope will lead to a
breakthrough.''
</P>
<P>
   But the nearly three-week hostage crisis appeared to be far from
over.
</P>
<P>
   The leader of the Abu Sayyaf guerrilla group said the hostages --
who include 10 Westerners -- had been moved by the rebels to a new
''safe place'' much deeper in the mountains of remote Jolo Island.
The rebels also rejected the government's proposed negotiating
team, demanding to deal only with people of their own choosing.
</P>
<P>
   If President Joseph Estrada refuses, said rebel leader Abu
Escobar, ''we are prepared to hold on to the hostages for a long
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Azzarouq met Wednesday with the rebels and asked for two sick
hostages -- a French man and a German woman -- to be released. The
rebels said they would reply Thursday, but movements by government
troops near the planned meeting place apparently spooked the rebels
and they never appeared, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiator Robert Aventajado, an adviser to Estrada, ordered the
military to pull further back Friday to prevent a reoccurrence, and
the envoys made brief contact late in the day.
</P>
<P>
   Abu Escobar, a rebel leader, said Friday that the group had
decided not to release the two hostages -- Renate Wallert, a German
woman with hypertension, and Stephane Loisy, a French man with a
urinary tract infection.
</P>
<P>
   Officials would not read the hostages' letters to reporters,
saying they were personal. They described one from Wallert's son,
Marc, as thanking everyone for exerting efforts on the hostages'
behalf.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels have yet to present a list of formal demands, and
will do so only to the negotiators they have specified, Escobar
said.
</P>
<P>
   Informally, however, they have said they want independence for
the region, the establishment of Islamic law, a return to barter
trade, and a ban on foreign fishing boats.
</P>
<P>
   The hostages -- three Germans, two French citizens, two South
Africans, two Finns, a Lebanese, nine Malaysians and two Filipinos
-- were kidnapped April 23 from Malaysia's Sipadan Island and taken
to Jolo, an island at the tip of the southern Philippines about an
hour away.
</P>
<P>
   Abu Sayyaf, the smaller and more extreme of two Muslim rebel
groups in the southern Philippines, is also holding a separate
group of Filipino hostages in nearby Basilan province. They seized
those hostages, many of whom are children, on March 20 from two
schools.
</P>
<P>
   The military overran the rebels' stronghold in Basilan last
month and later rescued 15 hostages. Four others were killed and
eight are believed to still be in rebel hands.

<HEADLINE> Heat 77, Knicks 76, OT  </HEADLINE>
By CHRIS SHERIDAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Of all the crazy, controversial endings the
Knicks and Heat have produced in the playoffs, this one was as wild
as any of them.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Carter's incredible shot from behind the backboard with
2.2 seconds left -- a shot that didn't count until an offensive
goaltending call was waved off -- gave Miami a 77-76 overtime
victory over New York on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   As low-scoring and foul-plagued as the game was, it was one of
the best ones the teams have produced in 20 postseason meetings. In
the end, the fickle bounce of the ball and a rare reversal of a
referee's call gave the Heat a 2-1 lead in the best-of-seven
series.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought it was a beautiful game, absolutely a beautiful
game,'' Miami coach Pat Riley said. ''If you want high-flying,
high-scoring games, I don't think this is the series to come
watch.''
</P>
<P>
   But for those who appreciate defense, drama and the unexpected,
this was a classic.
</P>
<P>
   Carter, playing the entire overtime as Tim Hardaway was
ineffective, drove along the baseline and faced such a tough angle
that he had to launch the ball over the top corner of the
backboard. Rising 15 feet in the air, the shot hit the front rim,
bounced high -- ''It went to the top of the Garden ceiling up
there,'' Riley said -- and fell through.
</P>
<P>
   Referee Danny Crawford immediately waved the basket off, ruling
that Alonzo Mourning had tipped the ball in, bringing Miami's
coaching staff sprinting onto the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ''The only thing going through my head was please don't take my
basket away, please,'' Carter said. ''It was one of the biggest
baskets of my career, and I'm glad one of the referees saw that Zo
did not touch the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   The other referees pulled Crawford aside and told him he made
the wrong call, and the basket counted.
</P>
<P>
   ''The ball was shot from behind the backboard, which should
result in an out-of-bounds on the side,'' Knicks coach Jeff Van
Gundy said. ''Clear as day on the replay.''
</P>
<P>
   The officials said the shot was legal because the ball did not
pass directly over the top of backboard, which is prohibited.
</P>
<P>
   ''It came over on an angle,'' Crawford said.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks had one last chance, but the inbounds pass was
deflected away from Latrell Sprewell into Jamal Mashburn's hands as
time expired.
</P>
<P>
   It was one of the oddest endings to any of the playoff games
between these teams, which is no small thing in a rivalry that has
featured fights, suspensions and last-second bounces -- but never a
shot quite like this one by Carter.
</P>
<P>
   The rookie finished with 10 points, eight assists and seven
rebounds to supplement 23 points from Mourning, 16 from Mashburn
and 14 from P.J. Brown in the first overtime playoff game between
the bitter rivals.
</P>
<P>
   The loss was an excruciating one for the Knicks, especially
Patrick Ewing, whose basket with 2.6 seconds left in regulation
forced overtime. But with a chance to give New York a two-point
lead with 13.7 seconds left, Ewing could only make one of two free
throws.
</P>
<P>
   ''Very disappointing,'' Ewing said. ''We were right there. We
just fell short.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first four quarters, the defense was so tight and the
offenses so flustered that it looked like it would be the lowest
scoring playoff game in NBA history. The record for fewest combined
points is 142.
</P>
<P>
   It would have earned that distinction even if Mashburn had hit
an open 20-footer at the buzzer in regulation, but he missed to
send the game into an extra period tied at 68-68.
</P>
<P>
   After Mashburn gave Miami a 71-70 lead on a 3-pointer, Allan
Houston got away with a palming violation right before he shot a
24-footer with 3:04 left to give the Knicks a 73-71 edge.
</P>
<P>
   Mashburn then missed a jumper, and Charlie Ward hit Marcus Camby
with a bullet pass under the basket. Camby caught the ball and
dunked it in one quick motion, putting the Knicks up by four with
2:14 left.
</P>
<P>
   Carter answered with two free throws and Mourning hit a jumper
to tie it at 75-75 with 1:17 left, and neither team could convert
on its next possession as Ewing dribbled the ball off his foot and
Majerle missed a long 3-pointer.
</P>
<P>
   Majerle was called for a reach-in foul on Ewing with 13.7
seconds left, but Ewing could only make one of two.
</P>
<P>
   Mourning, who led Miami with 15 points at halftime, picked up
three fouls -- his second, third and fourth -- in a span of 26
seconds early in the third and left the game with 8:13 left.
</P>
<P>
   Ward hit a jumper for a seven-point edge, but with the crowd
begging the Knicks to pull away, the opposite happened. Houston
missed two straight shots, Brown scored four straight points and
Clarence Weatherspoon hit a jumper to put the Heat ahead 52-51.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks led 56-55 entering the fourth, but went 0-for-4 with
four turnovers on their first eight possessions of the quarter, and
a jumper by Brown gave Miami a 60-57 lead with seven minutes left.
</P>
<P>
   Houston, who led the Knicks with 24 points, scored New York's
next three baskets on jumpers, while Mourning scored four of
Miami's next six to keep the Heat ahead by at least a point for the
next four minutes. With Miami ahead 68-66, Houston missed a short
jumper, Ward missed a 3-pointer after an offensive rebound and the
Knicks grabbed another rebound and called timeout with 6.1 seconds
left.
</P>
<P>
   Houston, double-teamed 15 feet away, found Ewing wide open three
feet behind at the free throw line. Ewing nailed the shot, tying
the game at 68. Mashburn got an open look from the top of the key
at the buzzer, but the shot was no good.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The crowd broke into a familiar anti-Riley chant early in
the first quarter. Riley, his attention focused on the court,
turned to assistant coach Stan Van Gundy and asked: ''What are they
chanting?'' Van Gundy didn't sugarcoat his answer as he quoted the
crowd's two-word phrase verbatim. ... Sprewell, usually the last to
arrive for home games, showed up just 80 minutes before tipoff.
Teammates Kurt Thomas and John Wallace arrived 20 minutes later.

<HEADLINE> Rockies 15, Giants 7  </HEADLINE>
By AARON J. LOPEZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- Jeffrey Hammonds homered twice and drove in a
career-high seven runs to lead the Colorado Rockies to a 15-7
victory over the San Francisco Giants on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Helton added four hits, including three doubles, as
Colorado shook off the absence of reigning NL batting champion
Larry Walker to score in double figures for the fifth straight home
game.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockies learned Friday that Walker will likely be out
several weeks with an elbow injury.
</P>
<P>
   After scoring 12 runs during a five-game road trip, the Rockies
had 13 by the third inning against the Giants, who shut out
Colorado in back-to-back games last week.
</P>
<P>
   Hammonds hit a three-run homer to highlight a five-run first and
added another three-run shot in the second for his eighth career
multihomer game. He also had an RBI single in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Coming off seven shutout innings last Friday, San Francisco
starter Joe Nathan (2-1) gave up 12 runs -- 10 earned -- in 2 2-3
innings.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Bohanon (1-3), banished to the bullpen after five poor
starts, gave up one run and three hits, struck out six and walked
one in six innings of relief. Starter Rolando Arrojo didn't make it
out of the third.
</P>
<P>
   As in years past, home was heavenly for the Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   They have scored 101 runs in their last eight games at Coors
Field and are averaging nearly 10 runs at home this season.
</P>
<P>
   Hammonds' second home run gave the Rockies an 8-3 lead, but
Armando Rios hit a two-run homer, his second of the season and the
game, to cut the lead to 8-6 in the third.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado took advantage of two Giants errors for five more runs
in the third and San Francisco never recovered in losing for just
the fourth time in 18 games.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Helton's three doubles tied a club record. It has been done
three times this season and 12 times in team history. ... Rios has
two career two-homer games. His other came last Oct. 2 against the
Rockies at Coors Field. ... Helton is 26-for-46 (.565) in his last
12 games. ... Neifi Perez went 3-for-5 and got career hit No. 500.
... Giants OF Ellis Burks has been nursing a pulled left quadriceps
muscle, and manager Dusty Baker said he plans to rest Burks
throughout the three-game series with the Rockies.

<HEADLINE> Duckpin Bowlers Ponder Decline  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID DISHNEAU
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAGERSTOWN, Md. (AP) -- Duckpin bowling, with its shrunken pins
and balls, has always been about smallness.
</P>
<P>
   Devotees feel it is shrinking even more -- in popularity.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to get into the 20th century and get a Web page and
explain to people more about duckpin bowling,'' Chuck Lavin,
executive director of the National Duckpin Bowling Congress, said
Friday as the group opened its annual meeting.
</P>
<P>
   According to Lavin, the game was born a century ago in Baltimore
and popularized along the East Coast by two Baltimore Orioles
baseball players, John McGraw and Wilbert Robinson, who owned a
bowling alley.
</P>
<P>
   They thought the squat pins -- two-thirds as tall as conventional
bowling pins -- flew around like ducks when struck, Lavin said.
</P>
<P>
   The sport peaked around 1950 with more than 300 duckpin alleys
from Massachusetts to North Carolina, according to Lavin and
bowling consultant Stacy Karten, publisher of Duckpin News in
Owings Mills.
</P>
<P>
   Today, just 80 bowling centers offer duckpins, mainly in
Connecticut, Maryland, Rhode Island, Virginia and West Virginia,
they said.
</P>
<P>
   Lavin said the number of leagues sanctioned by the
Baltimore-based duckpin congress has dwindled to 500 from 1,500 a
decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   The game's appeal is obvious to anyone who has ever picked up a
conventional tenpin ball, weighing 10 to 16 pounds. Duckpin balls
are about half as big and weigh less than four pounds. They have no
finger holes.
</P>
<P>
   Duckpin bowlers get three balls per frame -- one more than in
tenpins -- but that doesn't make it easier to score. No one has ever
bowled a perfect, 300-point game in duckpins, Lavin said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think duckpins is the game it is because it's a challenge,''
he said. ''You don't throw the ball down and get a strike every
time.''
</P>
<P>
   The last U.S. manufacturer of duckpin machines, Maryland-based
Sherman Pinsetter Co., disappeared decades ago, Karten said. As
duckpin alleys closed, their machines were bought by foreign
operators, mainly in the Philippines and Argentina, he said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. operators have turned to late-night laser bowling and
organized duckpin youth leagues in hopes of rekindling interest in
the game.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're in a lull right now,'' Lavin said. ''But we're
optimistic.''

<HEADLINE> Legionnaires' Survivors Reflect  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE CORDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) -- Ingrid Rigby decided not to take her
4-year-old son, Anthony, to Melbourne's popular new aquarium last
month. There would be too many people, too long a wait to get in.
</P>
<P>
   She let out a sigh of relief this week as she recalled the
decision.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were going to go in the Easter holidays. Luckily we
didn't,'' she said after visiting the aquarium Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Rigby's reluctance to wait outside the busy aquarium meant she
was not among thousands of visitors exposed to a fine mist of
microscopic water droplets tainted with the deadly legionella
bacteria that drifted out of the tourist attraction's air
conditioning cooling towers in mid-April.
</P>
<P>
   In the month since, three people have died, seven are
hospitalized in critical condition and a total of 93 people,
including Australian Finance Minister John Fahey, have been
confirmed as having contracted Legionnaires' disease.
</P>
<P>
   Elton Parkhill, one of those infected, is slowly recovering but
doctors fear his heart may have been permanently damaged.
</P>
<P>
   On April 18, Parkhill waited in line for more than an hour
outside the aquarium on the northern bank of the Yarra River while
his wife, Anita, took their two grandchildren to play elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Like others, he marveled at the beauty of the three-story,
oval-shaped blue building, with a metallic wave motif at the base.
He didn't notice the hot air blowing from the building's air
conditioning vents nearby. He also didn't know that the silent
stalker's incubation period meant that he would leave the aquarium
feeling fine.
</P>
<P>
   Eight days later, Parkhill, an active and healthy 76-year-old,
began to succumb to the pneumonia-like disease, which can kill up
to one in five of those infected and preys especially on the
elderly.
</P>
<P>
   ''I felt very stiff and then very, very weak -- unable to move,''
he recalled. ''For my age, I regard myself as pretty fit. I
couldn't understand it.''
</P>
<P>
   It was only when Parkhill's wife, Anita, heard about the
Legionnaires' outbreak that they called a doctor.
</P>
<P>
   Parkhill was admitted to the Royal Melbourne Hospital almost
immediately and treated with powerful antibiotics. He struggled for
each breath as he was fed oxygen through a mask.
</P>
<P>
   Parkhill said he feels lucky to be alive.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I'd gone into hospital a day later, I might not have
survived,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His story was echoed by 69-year-old English tourist Donald
Storer who visited the aquarium on April 14 with his wife and three
grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   A week later, he began to feel very tired. A day after that, he
could barely move. The following day he became delirious and was
not eating or drinking water. He was admitted to Melbourne's Box
Hill Hospital, where he was rehydrated and given antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
   Storer pulled through, but he has developed an irregular heart
beat and will have to be on medication for some time.
</P>
<P>
   Parkhill, Storer and the other visitors infected by the deadly
mist are not the only ones suffering.
</P>
<P>
   The $19.5 million Melbourne Aquarium, which opened at the
beginning of the year, was virtually deserted on Wednesday. Despite
a health official declaring the aquarium ''the safest place in
Melbourne to visit,'' attendance is down almost 50 percent,
spokesman Tom Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Before the outbreak, it had been one of Melbourne's most popular
tourist destinations and the biggest gun in the southern city's
battle for a share of the country's lucrative tourist trade.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are hardly any people inside,'' Rigby said after leaving
the aquarium with her son. She admitted to being apprehensive about
visiting, although the cooling towers have been declared safe.
</P>
<P>
   The aquarium also faces a class-action lawsuit seeking
unspecified compensation for those who became infected. The case
will go to Victoria Supreme Court for an initial hearing in July,
attorney Eugene Arocca said.
</P>
<P>
   But Melbourne's Legionnaires' crisis could have been much worse.
</P>
<P>
   Health authorities believe the swift discovery of the source of
the outbreak and widespread reporting of it meant that those
suffering sought medical help early, before their health
deteriorated irretrievably.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, outbreaks have been far more deadly.
</P>
<P>
   The worst on record was the first -- at a 1976 convention of the
American Legion in Philadelphia. It sickened more than 180 people,
killed 34 and gave the newly discovered disease its name.

<HEADLINE> Continental Airlines Raises Fares  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID KOENIG
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- The rising cost of fuel has forced Continental
Airlines to raise fares again, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   Continental raised all domestic business and leisure fares
Thursday night by $10 to $30 per round trip, depending on mileage,
said spokeswoman Sarah Anthony.
</P>
<P>
   Most other carriers didn't match the increases immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Among the major carriers, only US Airways matched the
Continental increase by Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest Airlines, which has often led resistance to other
recent fare hikes, won't match Continental on basic walkup and
seven-day and 14-day advance-purchase fares, spokesman Jon Austin
said. However, Northwest did match Continental's increase in
tickets with severe purchase and use restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   United, American and Delta, the nation's three largest carriers,
had not matched the increase by Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Southwest Airlines spokesman Ed Stewart said the low-cost
carrier, which is based in Dallas and competes with Continental on
many routes, has no intention of raising fares.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Trippler of 1travel.com, an online seller of discount
travel tickets, said the die may have been cast against
Continental's move when Northwest Airlines matched only on the
limited fares, which are referred to as ''garbage fares'' in the
industry.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think this one's going to fly,'' Trippler said. ''Even
if everyone else agrees (with the increase) and Northwest doesn't,
it will fall. Northwest is big enough to stop it. It looks like a
big flop.''

<HEADLINE> UN: Halt Eritrea-Ethiopia Fighting  </HEADLINE>
By NICOLE WINFIELD
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Hoping to contain Africa's newest war, the
Security Council demanded that Eritrea and Ethiopia immediately
stop fighting and hinted at a possible arms embargo if the conflict
doesn't die down over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   In a resolution unanimously adopted Friday just hours after
fighting along the Eritrean-Ethiopian border flared, the council
demanded the Horn of Africa neighbors restart stalled peace talks
that broke down last week.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution said the council would meet again on Monday ''to
take immediate steps to ensure compliance with this resolution'' if
fighting continues.
</P>
<P>
   British Ambassador Jeremy Greenstock, who drafted the
resolution, said that was a clear threat of an arms embargo. He
attributed the vague wording in the resolution more to bureaucratic
problems than any lack of substance or resolve on the part of the
council to actually impose the measures.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that if the international community can show its
displeasure with these developments by saying that it should not be
so easy for these two countries to get arms, then we might have
taken a step forward,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   France, Russia and China had blocked British attempts to make
the threat of an arms embargo more specific in Friday's resolution,
diplomats said, but Greenstock said he hoped the council would be
able to make a unanimous decision on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''This war everybody believes is unnecessary and senseless,''
Greenstock said.
</P>
<P>
   Two days after a U.N. Security Council delegation abandoned
attempts to get the two countries to resume indirect talks, the
feuding neighbors reported heavy fighting Friday at three contested
points along their border.
</P>
<P>
   The delegation tried unsuccessfully to get both sides to accept
another round of indirect talks within an Organization of African
Unity framework to which both have already agreed.
</P>
<P>
   But both countries held fast to their previous positions.
</P>
<P>
   Ethiopia refuses to agree to a cease-fire until all other
aspects of the agreement are in place; Eritrea won't move on the
details until a cease-fire has been declared.
</P>
<P>
   The two-year conflict over the 620-mile border between Ethiopia
and Eritrea -- among the world's poorest countries -- has cost the
lives of thousands of soldiers and civilians on both sides.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Ambassador Richard Holbrooke, who was part of the council
delegation, accused Ethiopia and Eritrea of ''stupidity'' for
whipping up relatively minor disputes out of national pride and of
''cruel disregard for the interests of the people.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters in Munich, Germany, Holbrooke said
millions of people were threatened with famine in southern Ethiopia
because the government is spending its meager resources on the war.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Secretary-General Kofi Annan predicted ''a very
brutal war'' and implored both sides to stop fighting and think of
their people, who are already suffering gravely from the effects of
a drought.
</P>
<P>
   ''The secretary-general stresses that the differences between
the two countries cannot justify in any way the great loss in human
lives they already have suffered and stand to suffer further. He is
further concerned that the renewed fighting will worsen the already
grave humanitarian situation prevailing in both countries and in
the Horn of Africa region more widely,'' said the statement read by
spokesman Fred Eckhard.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. World Food Program estimates that there are 16 million
people at risk of starvation in the Horn of Africa.

<HEADLINE> National Debt Clock To Go Dark  </HEADLINE>
By SETH SUTEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- It's a sign of the times whose time has run out.
</P>
<P>
   After more than a decade of tallying up our nation's debt
second-by-second for all the world to see, the National Debt Clock
-- the green electronic sign atop a building near Times Square -- is
being unplugged.
</P>
<P>
   Often times, the debt was rising so fast the last several digits
were just a blur.
</P>
<P>
   But these days, the numbers barely budge, and the national debt
has actually decreased since the beginning of the year, what with
these strange phenomena of budget surpluses and the first buybacks
of government debt in 70 years.
</P>
<P>
   So, the owners of the sign are pulling the plug.
</P>
<P>
   Barring an unexpected reversal in Washington's newfound sense of
fiscal responsibility, the clock will go dark on Sept. 7, the
birthday of the man who invented it, the late New York developer
Seymour Durst.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was put up to focus attention on the increasing national
debt, and it's served its purpose,'' said Durst's son, Douglas
Durst, who now runs the family real estate business.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're obviously pleased that it was partially because of the
sign that attention was focused on the debt and efforts were made
to bring it under control. We think he'd be real happy with the
fact that the deficit has been eliminated.''
</P>
<P>
   The sign was just one facet of the elder Durst's campaign to
raise public awareness of the soaring budget deficits of the 1980s
and '90s. He also bought tiny ads at the bottom of the front page
of The New York Times with dire warnings such as ''Beware the
Four-Letter Word -- Debt.''
</P>
<P>
   Durst's efforts can be traced back at least to 1980, when he
sent New Year's cards to businessmen and politicians warning that
the national debt had reached $914 billion. As of Thursday, the
latest day the figure had been calculated by the government, that
figure was $5.7 trillion, or $5,666,074,628,759.68 at one moment.
</P>
<P>
   Durst put up the sign in 1989. The sign has run with some
interruptions since then. It had to be turned off for a few months
in the mid-'90s when the debt was increasing so fast it crashed the
computer that calculates the debt.
</P>
<P>
   How times have changed. Blessed with budget surpluses, the
government announced in January that it planned to buy back up to
$30 billion of debt this year. It also said that the entire $3.6
trillion of the national debt held by the public could be wiped out
by 2013 under current projections for budget surpluses.
</P>
<P>
   David M. Jones, chief economist for bond dealer Aubrey G.
Lanston &AMP; Co., said the dimming of the debt clock was not something
he expected to see in his lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   ''It became an institution and people began to believe there was
no end in sight and no hope for reducing the deficit,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   What will become of the clock?
</P>
<P>
   Durst said the it merely will be covered with a cloth for the
time being.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not taking it away -- anything can happen,'' Durst said.
''We'd have to store it someplace, and that's a good a place as
any. It's not exactly the kind of thing you can keep in a closet.''

<HEADLINE> Sect Members Jailed in Boys' Case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   FALL RIVER, Mass. (AP) -- Two more members of a religious sect
have been jailed for refusing to testify in an investigation into
the whereabouts of two boys.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities believe the boys may have been buried in a Maine
park last year.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Daneau, 64, and his son, Mark Daneau, 21, were ordered
jailed Thursday. The men are members of a strict religious sect
that rejects conventional medicine and schools, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Three other members of the sect -- Roland Robidoux, Tim Daneau
and Michael Robidoux Mingo -- were jailed last week for not
cooperating with the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Another man, Jacques Robidoux, has been in jail since November
for refusing to give investigators the whereabouts of his
10-month-old son, Samuel.
</P>
<P>
   Two former members of the group told investigators last year
that Samuel and his newborn cousin, Jeremiah Corneau, died and were
buried by members of the sect in Baxter State Park.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators failed to find the boys, but uncovered journals
written by an unidentified group member that claim Jeremiah was
stillborn, and that Samuel was denied food for weeks before dying
in the spring, prosecutors have said.
</P>
<P>
   The journal claimed group members viewed Samuel's death as the
will of God.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Maine plan to renew their search for the bodies.
</P>
<P>
   ''We'll be going over much smaller area, but with many more
people, and hopefully we'll get lucky,'' said Warden Sgt. Roger
Guay.

<HEADLINE> FBI Computer Flaw Halts Gun Sales  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A nationwide halt in firearms sales entered
its third day today as FBI employees worked to fix an internal
software problem in the bureau's criminal history database that
halted instant background checks of gun buyers.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI's Interstate Identification Index, a database containing
criminal histories of 36 million people, stopped working late
Thursday afternoon, the bureau said Friday. This computer failure
halted gun sales because it prevented completion of background
checks that the Brady law requires for buyers.
</P>
<P>
   Gun dealers hoped for a quick fix because Saturday is their
busiest day. But FBI spokesman Paul Bresson said bureau and
contractor employees thought it would take until this evening or
Sunday morning to get the system working again.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was an internal database problem, not the result of a
hacking or external attack,'' Bresson said.
</P>
<P>
   With the ''Million Mom March'' scheduled in Washington and 70
other cities Sunday to demand more gun controls and expanded
background checks, both federal officials and gun dealers expressed
concern that some people would jump to the conclusion the two
events were linked or the background check failure was deliberate.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials rejected either idea. ''The mere suggestion
that we would orchestra such a thing is totally outrageous,''
Bresson said.
</P>
<P>
   Without background check approvals, gun dealers said that since
Thursday afternoon they have been forced to tell their customers to
wait for their guns until the system comes back up and the checks
can be completed. It was not known how many sales were affected.
</P>
<P>
   The computer failure made it impossible for the National Instant
Criminal Background Check System, or NICS, to check the criminal
histories for past felony convictions that bar people from buying
guns. Also brought down was the FBI's automated fingerprint system.
</P>
<P>
   Although gunstore owners in only about half the states file
their background check inquiries directly with the FBI, the failure
affected checks nationwide. In states where gun dealers place
background check requests with a state police agency, that agency
checks the FBI's criminal histories by computer in addition to its
own records before approving or disapproving the sale.
</P>
<P>
   ''We can't release any guns to our customers until it's fixed,''
said Art Harris, owner of The Gentleman Hunter in Bethesda, Md.
''We haven't lost any deals yet, but Saturday is our biggest day.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I suppose some gun buyers are angry over the delay, but our
customers have been very understanding,'' Harris said.
</P>
<P>
   When the system is working, 72 percent of gun purchases are
approved within 30 seconds, the Justice Department says. And 95
percent of buyers get an approval or a disapproval within two hours
of their purchase application.
</P>
<P>
   In its first 13 months of operation, the NICS system completed
more than 10 million background checks. Only 5 percent required
more than two hours to complete the background check.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had four prospective sales Friday, but we can't deliver the
guns because we can't get approvals,'' said Tommy Thacker, manager
of Loudoun Guns in Leesburg, Va. ''We just tell them we'll call
them when the system is up.''
</P>
<P>
   In Virginia, gun dealers like Thacker are linked by computer
with the Virginia State Police, but that agency is linked to the
FBI computer to check federal criminal history records. ''So the
state can't give approvals,'' Thacker said.
</P>
<P>
   ''No one has gotten angry so far,'' Thacker said. ''But it could
get sticky'' because once the sale applications are again accepted,
the backlog could delay completion of some checks.
</P>
<P>
   The Brady law gives law enforcement up to three business days to
complete a gun check, but that period does not begin until the
computer accepts the application.
</P>
<P>
   The computer failure and threat of a backlog created a weekend
of extra work at the FBI Criminal Information Center in Morgantown,
W.Va., Bresson said. Federal officials said extra workers were
being called in to clear any backlog over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Other functions of the FBI's computerized National Crime
Information Center 2000, that serves state and local police as well
as federal agents around the nation, continued in service. The
unaffected services included the FBI's lists of wanted people,
fugitives, stolen guns and stolen property.

<HEADLINE> Court Decision May Alter Funding  </HEADLINE>
By JONATHAN D. SALANT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal court decision has moved closer to
removing all limits on what political parties may spend on behalf
of their candidates at a time when the Democrats and Republicans
are breaking all fund-raising records.
</P>
<P>
   But with both parties already spending unlimited ''soft money''
contributions on issue ads, any impact may be muted, said Jim
Jordan, political director for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   And that assumes the decision stands. Lawyers for both parties
are reviewing the case, which still could be appealed to the
Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   ''It remains to be seen whether that decision will have an
impact on the 2000 races,'' said Jonathan Grella, spokesman for the
National Republican Senatorial Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The Denver-based 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals earlier this
month struck down federal limits on how much money the parties can
spend on activities coordinated with the candidates.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the Supreme Court ruled that parties can spend as much
money as they want to help elect candidates so long as they don't
coordinate their expenditures with the campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   The parties already are pouring millions of dollars in
unregulated soft money into issue advertisements that are designed
to help elect candidates without specifically urging voters to
support them.
</P>
<P>
   Current law limits both the national and state parties to
spending $33,780 apiece to help elect a House candidate. The Senate
limits are based on population, and range from $135,120 in Delaware
to $3,272,876 in California.
</P>
<P>
   The money is in addition to the maximum $17,500 contribution a
party can make to a Senate campaign and $10,000 contribution to a
House campaign.
</P>
<P>
   If the federal court decision stands, it will give the parties
more flexibility in deciding how to spend its ''hard money'' --
funds raised under federal limits that can be used to directly aid
congressional candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ''The ruling really elevates hard money,'' said Rep. Tom Davis,
R-Va., chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee.
''I would much rather use coordinated dollars than run issue ads.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the aisle, Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee
spokesman John Del Cecato said his party has plenty of hard money
to match the GOP spending.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whatever the environment is, our financial advantage will make
us better equipped to compete,'' Del Cecato said.
</P>
<P>
   The parties are routinely reporting new fund-raising records.
For example, the DCCC had $28.6 million in the bank as of March 31,
nine times more than the $3.1 million it had four years ago. The
NRCC reported a bank account balance of $18.2 million, up from $11
million during the same period in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton is scheduled to headline a Philadelphia
fund-raising event next Friday that is to bring in an estimated
$500,000 for the DCCC, while Vice President Al Gore is the guest of
honor at a birthday party and fund-raiser for Rep. Charles Rangel,
D-N.Y., who would become chairman of the House Ways and Means
Committee if the Democrats recapture the House. The Rangel bash,
scheduled for June 5 in New York City, ''has the potential to be
one of our biggest events outside of Washington ever,'' Del Cecato
said.
</P>
<P>
   On the Republican side, presumptive presidential nominee George
W. Bush has agreed to headline some fund-raisers for the House
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's a critical part of us keeping the House,'' Davis said.

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers Move Against Corps Change  </HEADLINE>
By JENNIFER LOVEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congress is moving to block the Clinton
administration's effort to break up the cozy relationship between
Capitol Hill and the Army Corps of Engineers, which is battling
charges that top officials rigged data to justify a costly
Mississippi River construction project.
</P>
<P>
   A provision forbidding federal funds from being used to make
management changes at the corps was quietly tacked onto the
spending blueprint for agricultural programs next year. The $75.3
billion bill was approved by the Senate Appropriations Committee
earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   The ''rider,'' inserted by Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., is aimed
at an announcement last month by Army Secretary Louis Caldera that
all final decisions on corps project recommendations would be
placed in the hands of the Army's assistant secretary for civil
works. Caldera's changes were an attempt to assert his control over
the corps and its $4 billion in river construction and flood
control projects.
</P>
<P>
   But the Republican chairmen of the Senate Appropriations, Armed
Services and Environment committees complained. They said the
reforms might allow too much involvement by the Clinton
administration in the corps' recommendations to Congress on
projects, which are popular with lawmakers for the jobs and
spending they bring to their districts.
</P>
<P>
   Caldera agreed to suspend the restructuring, while the three
committees conduct a still-pending joint investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The rider drew a strong reaction from the Pentagon. A statement
from the Army noted the administration is cooperating with the
Senate investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ''In light of those ongoing discussions, the introduction of
this new proposal is unwarranted and unproductive,'' the Army
statement said. ''Moreover, we are deeply concerned about the
effect the proposed provision would have on the authority and
responsibility of the executive branch ... to manage the corps,
maintain civilian oversight of the agency and ensure appropriate
accountability to the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   The provision also angered environmental groups.
</P>
<P>
   ''The absence of meaningful civilian oversight over the Corps of
Engineers has empowered Congress to set the agenda for the corps,''
said Scott Faber of the conservation group American Rivers. ''That
has created an environment where the abuse of corps planning rules
is rampant.''
</P>
<P>
   Domenici spokesman Chris Gallegos said the senator just wanted
to ensure no changes would be enacted without consultation with
Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is an attempt to shift accountability of the Army Corps
from Congress and more to the administration side,'' Gallegos said.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy began when a whistleblower alleged that top
corps brass altered an economic study to favor a $1 billion project
to double the length of seven barge locks on the upper Mississippi
and Illinois rivers.
</P>
<P>
   Politically connected agribusiness companies say the 60-year-old
navigation system needs massive modernizations to ensure faster,
cheaper trips for commodity-laden barges.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists argue the river's fragile ecosystem cannot
handle more large-scale changes without serious losses in habitats
and fish and bird populations.
</P>
<P>
   The sworn affidavit filed by corps economist Donald Sweeney led
the federal Office of the Special Counsel to order the Army, which
oversees the corps, to investigate. Caldera also has asked the
National Academy of Sciences to examine the corps study. In
addition, some in Congress have asked for reviews of their own and
several committees are investigating.
</P>
<P>
   Corps officials have repeatedly denied wrongdoing, saying new
data -- not foul play -- has caused the still-unfinished study to
change.

Philippine Rebels Reopen Contact
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   JOLO, Philippines (AP) -- Muslim rebels holding 21 hostages in the Philippine
jungle said Saturday that they would consider releasing two ailing captives. The
Abu Sayyaf rebels' willingness to consider the release appeared to be a positive
shift from a day earlier, when the guerrillas had decided against freeing them,
said a negotiator, who spoke on the condition he not be named. Contacts with the
rebels, broken since Wednesday, were re-established Friday night when the
separatist guerrillas delivered seven letters their captives had written to

Falun Gong Members Celebrate
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- Followers of the Falun Gong sect held yellow flowers and
signs aloft in Tiananmen Square, defiantly celebrating their banned spiritual
movement's eighth anniversary Saturday and drawing rough arrest by Chinese
police. Police beat five people as they tried to unfurl a banner. Another woman
was knocked to the ground by plainclothes security officers as she stood amid 10
followers raising signs. One read ''Truthfulness, Benevolence, Forbearance,''
Falun Gong's motto. The protest was the third recent demonstration to mark key

   LOS ALAMOS, N.M. (AP) -- Although blowtorch winds and searing heat that fed a
raging Los Alamos wildfire broke Friday, the fire remained out of control in the
nearby forests and canyons, and residents were told they could not return to
their houses for at least a week. The fire, which began with a
government-prescribed burn to clear brush, damaged the town's nuclear weapons
laboratory and forced 25,000 people to flee. The weapon lab appeared out of
danger today, and all of the facility's major buildings were unscathed, said
Richard Burick, deputy lab director for operations.

Ethiopia, Eritrea Fighting Again

   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) -- Ignoring international pleas to end their
two-year border conflict, Ethiopia and Eritrea returned to open war on Friday
with fighting reported on three fronts. U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
predicted ''a very brutal war,'' and expressed frustration that peace efforts
had failed. The two sides issued contradictory statements on the details of the
fighting, but both agreed that war had erupted once again along the 620-mile
frontier, which contains a now-evacuated stretch of fertile land of great value
in this drought-wracked region of Africa. The U.N. Security Council demanded the
two countries immediately stop fighting and hinted at a possible arms embargo if
Africa's newest war doesn't dissipate over the weekend.

<HEADLINE> Study Questions 'Sex Reassignment'  </HEADLINE>
By SETH HETTENA
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE (AP) -- The practice of surgically ''reassigning'' boys
born without penises is being called into question by a new study
that suggests gender identity is determined in the womb.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at the Johns Hopkins Hospital on Friday said the
study found that such boys, raised as girls, had masculine behavior
and most declared themselves to be boys.
</P>
<P>
   In what is believed to be the first study of its kind,
researchers tracked the development of 27 children born without a
penis, a rare defect known as a cloacal exstrophy. The infants were
otherwise male with normal testicles, male genes and hormones.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five of the children were sex reassigned, meaning doctors
castrated them at birth and their parents raised them as girls.
</P>
<P>
   But over the years, all of the children, currently aged 5-16,
exhibited the rough-and-tumble play of boys. Fourteen declared
themselves to be boys, in one case as early as age 5, said Dr.
William G. Reiner, a child and adolescent psychiatrist and
urologist at the Hopkins Children's Center.
</P>
<P>
   ''These studies indicate that with time and age, children may
well know what their gender is, regardless of any and all
information and child-rearing to the contrary,'' he said. ''They
seem to be quite capable of telling us who they are.''
</P>
<P>
   The two children who were not reassigned and were raised as boys
fit in well with their normal male peers and were better adjusted
psychologically than the reassigned children, Reiner said.
</P>
<P>
   He called for a thorough review of the practice of sex
reassignment of children.
</P>
<P>
   The study was presented Friday at the Lawson Wilkins Pediatric
Endocrine Society Meeting in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The results contradicted a Canadian study published in the
journal Pediatrics in 1998 that suggested gender identity develops
after birth. In that study, researchers found that a boy who was
raised as a girl after his penis was mutilated during circumcision
continued to live as a woman.
</P>
<P>
   ''This has very profound implications for the development of
gender identity,'' said Michael Bailey, an associate professor of
psychology at Northwestern University who studies gender identity
and sexual orientation. ''This suggests that hormones' effect on
the brain has a major impact on gender identity.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Marianne J. Legato, a Columbia University professor of
clinical medicine who studies the differences between men and
women, said sexual differentiation occurs in the first trimester of
pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   ''When the brain has been masculinized by exposure to
testosterone, it is kind of useless to say to this individual,
'You're a girl,''' she said. ''It is this impact of testosterone
that gives males the feelings that they are men.''

<HEADLINE> Twins 4, White Sox 3, 10 Innings  </HEADLINE>
By RICK GANO
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Corey Koskie delivered his fourth hit of the
game, a 10th-inning RBI single Friday night, as the Minnesota Twins
beat Chicago 4-3, sending the White Sox to their ninth loss in 11
games.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Coomer drew a walk off Sean Lowe (1-1) and pinch-hitter
David Ortiz dropped a single to center. Koskie then hit a hard
grounder that went under Paul Konerko's glove at first and into
right field as Coomer scored.
</P>
<P>
   It was the third straight dramatic win for the Twins, who
rallied from 8-1 and 5-0 deficits to win their last two games
against Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Travis Miller (1-2) got four outs for the win and Hector
Carrasco pitched the 10th for his first save.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing 3-1, Chicago tied it in the fifth after Mark Johnson
and Jose Valentin hit singles off starter Joe Mays. Frank Thomas
blooped a double down the right-field line that a diving Matt
Lawton just missed as Johnson scored. Lawton retrieved the ball and
overthrew the cutoff man for an error, allowing Valentin to also
score.
</P>
<P>
   Mays, who was 2-0 with a 1.96 ERA against the White Sox last
season, allowed nine hits and three runs in 7 2-3 innings before he
was lifted.
</P>
<P>
   Sox starter Jim Parque, who'd missed his previous start while
serving a three-game suspension for his role in an April melee with
Detroit, walked Koskie and Matt LeCroy to start the second before
Jacque Jones and Cristian Guzman delivered RBI singles for a 2-0
lead.
</P>
<P>
   Koskie's double, a wild pitch and another run-scoring single by
Jones made it 3-0 in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Lee hit an RBI double in the fourth to score Chris
Singleton from first, making it 3-1.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The start of the game was delayed 1 hour, 31 minutes by
rain. ... Thomas' first-inning single moved him into sole
possession of fifth place on the White Sox's career hit list with
1,609, moving ahead of Ozzie Guillen. ... Jones, who went 3-for-4,
is now 21-for-49 over his last 16 games. He also made two great
catches, the first in the eighth when he jumped into the wall to
snag Lee's long foul fly. Then in the ninth he crashed into the
center field fence to rob Valentin of extra bases and send the game
to extra innings.

<HEADLINE> Indian Woman Is Miss Universe 2000  </HEADLINE>
By VIJAY JOSHI
<TEXT>
<P>
   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) -- A 21-year-old model from India who said
beauty pageants give women a platform to ''voice our choices and
opinions'' was named Miss Universe early Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Lara Dutta succeeded Mpule Kwelagobe of Botswana to become the
49th winner of the pageant and the first Miss Universe of the new
millennium.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is going to take a while to sink in. It is a wonderful and
incredible, exhilarating feeling,'' Dutta said.
</P>
<P>
   Claudia Morena, 22, of Venezuela was second and Helen Lindes,
18, of Spain was third. Miss USA Lynnette Cole, 22, of Columbia,
Tenn., was among the five finalists.
</P>
<P>
   Dutta, who holds a master's degree in communications, won out
over 78 other contestants who had competed over the past three
weeks on this Mediterranean island, which promoted itself as the
island of love.
</P>
<P>
   The show was broadcast live on CBS television, beginning at 4
a.m. in Cyprus. Organizers said they chose that odd local hour to
take advantage of the prime time evening viewing in the Americas.
</P>
<P>
   Dutta won the crown after impressing the judges on the final
question of the contest: What would you say to those who condemn
the contest as an affront to women.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think pageants like Miss Universe give us young women a
platform to foray in the fields that we want to and forge ahead,''
Dutta said. ''It gives us a platform to voice our choices and
opinions.''
</P>
<P>
   The pageant was carried out amid a background of protest, with
the cypriot Church condemning it as being unchristian and an
affront to feminism.
</P>
<P>
   After sunset Friday, about 100 mostly middle-age women held an
all-night protest vigil at a hilltop church overlooking the
Eleftheria stadium where the pageant is being held.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, the parishioners distributed leaflets on the street
that said: ''Shame to the beauty contest which plunges women down
to the bottomless pit of hell.''
</P>
<P>
   Cyprus' Westernized residents have largely ignored the church
protests, which also center on the pageant sponsors linking it to
Aphrodite, the Greek goddess of love.
</P>
<P>
   As her name was announced, Dutta, wearing a single-strap,
glittering red gown, raised her hand to her mouth and hugged
Moreno, of Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
   Dutta had consistently impressed the judges with her beauty,
poise and presence, winning the swimsuit event and placing fourth
the evening gown competition.
</P>
<P>
   ''She represents the women of 2000s so clearly,'' said
motivation speaker Tony Robbins, one of the judges. ''She had such
a regal aura about her.''

<HEADLINE> Court: We're not getting involved in nude photo shoot case  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- In a rare occurrence, members of the state's
highest court declined to give their opinions about the legality of
photographer Spencer Tunick's posing nude models on the streets and
bridges of New York City.
</P>
<P>
   The Court of Appeals Friday refused a request by the federal
Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit to clarify questions of
state law.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, the federal appeals panel wanted answers to
''certified questions'' whether a photo shoot of between 75 and 100
naked people arranged in abstract formations would be barred under
state nudity laws and whether it makes any difference whether the
photo shoot is outdoors or indoors.
</P>
<P>
   For only the fifth time since the state Court of Appeals started
answering such certified questions for other courts in 1986, the
judges declined to venture their opinions.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the judges said it would be best if the issue was
worked out in federal court without their input. In an unsigned
ruling, the judges said it would take them months to gather briefs
and hear oral arguments about the certified question, and they said
there was a fair chance the issue would be decided by federal
judges before they could render a ruling anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ''We conclude that certification should be declined in the
mutual interest of expeditious resolution'' of Tunick's contention
he is being denied his right of free expression by New York City's
police department, the court said.
</P>
<P>
   Tunick in July 1999 did receive a permit to take photos for five
minutes with models' clothes on, but he was barred from getting a
second permit for taking pictures of nude models by city Police
Commissioner Howard Safir. Safir argued the nude shoot would
violate city and state laws against public nudity.
</P>
<P>
   One of the lawyers representing Tunick, Norman Siegel of the New
York Civil Liberties Union, called the Court of Appeals' decision
not to answer the certified questions ''extraordinary'' and
''unusual.''
</P>
<P>
   The case now goes back to federal court. Tunick initially won
when federal Judge Harold Baer Jr. last July enjoined the city from
interfering with the artist, but the federal Court of Appeals
stayed Baer's injunction pending answers on the certified questions
from the Court of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   Siegel said he did not think the federal appeals court needed
any help from the state Court of Appeals to decide the
free-expression claim raised by Tunick.
</P>
<P>
   ''We thought that they could decide the question,'' Siegel said.
''I think where we are, possibly we lost a few months on this in
the time frame, but it is unprecedented.''
</P>
<P>
   The photographer has earned a reputation for taking unusual
pictures of large numbers of nude people in public places,
including the streets and bridges of New York. He usually takes the
photos during hours when there are few passers-by, but he and his
models have repeatedly been arrested. The charges previously have
been dropped.

<HEADLINE> Giuliani weighing options in continuing Senate bid  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Closeted with top advisers, Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani is questioning whether he can salvage a Senate bid against
Hillary Rodham Clinton and weighing his health and marital
problems.
</P>
<P>
   A person very knowledgeable about the Republican mayor's
discussions, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that as the
conversations proceeded Friday, Giuliani sounded increasingly
discouraged about the prospects for his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The source said that pessimism was reflected in ''the type of
questions that he's asking and the kinds of comments he's making
after we give him answers.''
</P>
<P>
   Cautioning that the situation was extremely fluid, the source
said the mayor was going back and forth in his thinking about
whether to stay in the race.
</P>
<P>
   As of late Friday, the mayor had not told his advisers what he
would do, and the source said that the mayor's inner circle did not
expect a decision before Sunday or Monday at the earliest.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the New York City mayor was scheduled to speak tonight
in Oneonta at the Delaware County GOP dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani announced two weeks ago he had been diagnosed with
prostate cancer. The following week he told reporters he was
spending time with ''a very good friend,'' Judith Nathan. This
week, he disclosed he was seeking a legal separation from his wife
of 16 years, Donna Hanover. Hanover responded by dropping her own
bombshell, alleging that their marital woes began several years go
over his relationship with a former press aide, Cristyne
Lategano-Nicholas.
</P>
<P>
   Several Republicans have indicated they might be willing to step
into the race if Giuliani does quit. They include Reps. Rick Lazio
and Peter King, both of Long Island; Wall Street financier Theodore
Forstmann; and state Assembly Minority Leader John Faso, among
others.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, still working through his health and marital
problems, the mayor said he was still mulling over his options but
promised a decision as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   He said he felt a responsibility to the Republican Party and
would ''make a decision as quickly as I can responsibly make it.''
The state party's convention is May 30 to nominate a candidate for
the Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani made it clear that his health was his top priority when
he talked about possibly canceling a few political events next
week, including several fund-raisers.
</P>
<P>
   ''If some things are canceled, that's the reason they're being
canceled,'' he said. ''There are things I couldn't do this week
that I'm going to have to do next week.''
</P>
<P>
   A fund-raising trip slated for several cities in California next
Tuesday and Wednesday was still tentative, but could easily be
rescheduled, said campaign spokeswoman Juleanna Glover Weiss.
</P>
<P>
   ''We still very much believe that he is running,'' she added.

<HEADLINE> Pollsters see potential Giuliani problems in close race  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Voter dissatisfaction over Rudolph
Giuliani's marital problems and concern about his health are
beginning to show up in the polls, albeit in small numbers, in New
York's already close U.S. Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   Pollsters said the situation spells potential electoral trouble
for the New York City mayor should he stay in the race against
Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ''You don't need a poll to tell you this is going to hurt him,''
Maurice Carroll, director of the Quinnipiac College Polling
Institute, said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   A New York Daily News/New York 1 poll out Friday found that 81
percent of New York voters said Giuliani's announcement this week
that he and his wife were discussing a legal separation was a
private matter and had no effect on how they viewed him as a Senate
candidate. Nonetheless, 11 percent said the issue was relevant and
made them see him more negatively as a candidate.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if the combination of factors -- his treatable
prostate cancer, the separation, his close friendship with Judith
Nathan and his wife's claim that he had a previous relationship
with a City Hall employee during their marriage -- meant he should
get out of the race, 63 percent said he should continue to run.
Seventeen percent said he should pack up his campaign gear.
</P>
<P>
   Asked Friday if he found the results heartening, Giuliani said:
''No, this is a very highly, personal matter. My focus and concern
are for all the people involved in it. I've never paid an awful lot
of attention to polls.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor said he had still not made up his mind about staying
in the race.
</P>
<P>
   A New York Post/Fox TV poll from the end of April, conducted by
Zogby International just after Giuliani announced he had cancer,
found that 12 percent of voters felt that meant he was no longer a
strong candidate. Eighty-two percent said he did remain a strong
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   While the negative fallout for Giuliani appears relatively
small, thus far, it comes at a time when the polls were showing the
race to be a statistical dead heat even before news of the mayor's
health and marital problems surfaced.
</P>
<P>
   Pollsters said it was the marital problems, particularly wife
Donna Hanover's allegations about the mayor's earlier behavior,
that presented the greatest political threat for Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that was very damaging. He's been nurturing upstate,
traditional conservative voters, many of whom may not be following
the give and take,'' said Lee Miringoff, head of Marist College's
Institute for Public Opinion. ''But the net effect of it all is
there was some wrongdoing and he was the perpetrator.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I think there's a general discomfort in watching 'Scenes From
a Marriage' and the unfolding of one's private life,'' pollster
John Zogby said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The only people likely to care about the allegations and the
issue of the marriage are social conservative types of voters and I
think they hate Hillary,'' Zogby added. ''But they might not vote
for him'' as a result of the new information.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, the independent statewide polls have, for months,
been showing that most voters have already made up their minds
about Giuliani and Clinton and that the battle is over a very small
segment of undecided voters. A Quinnipiac poll out May 1 had just
10 percent of those surveyed still on the fence. Clinton was at 46
percent to 44 percent for Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times has been following 11 such voters. Three of
the seven they were able to contact told the newspaper for its
Friday editions that the Giuliani marital situation had turned them
against him.
</P>
<P>
   ''I tried to overlook a lot of things,'' Thomas Beck, a Long
Island guidance counselor, told the Times. '' But I'm X-ing him out
now, I really am.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Stick a fork in him; he's done,'' said Doug Taggart, vice
president of a financial services firm in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's too much scandal for me,'' Charlene Clinton, a school
aide from Buffalo, told the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Miringoff said that about the only political bright spot for
Giuliani was that the election was still six months away.
</P>
<P>
   ''Should he decide to keep running, now is better than
mid-October,'' the Poughkeepsie-based pollster said.
</P>
<P>
   Quinnipiac College's Carroll said that in addition to hurting
him with voters, the situation will also ''hurt his capacity to
concentrate on the job'' of being a candidate. ''It's a lot of
work. You've got to concentrate. You've got to focus.''

<HEADLINE> Friend's persistence earns Vietnam veteran a place on the memorial wall </HEADLINE>
By CAROLYN THOMPSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- David O. Kamp is finally on the Vietnam War
Memorial Wall, set in stone as solid as the friendship that grew
between the radio operator and the platoon leader whose life he
saved, and who fought to have the name inscribed.
</P>
<P>
   Marine Cpl. Kamp's name was to be added to the wall this week.
It will be acknowledged at a Memorial Day ceremony that would not
be taking place if not for the persistence of a platoon
leader-turned-school teacher, First Lt. Dick Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'll be down in D.C. this Memorial Day,'' Anderson promised
Friday from his Portville home, about 70 miles south of Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   Kamp, a native of Muskegon, Mich., was paralyzed at age 19 in a
firefight with the Viet Cong in December 1967. He died of heart
failure and infection in Florida in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   After Kamp's death, Anderson made it his mission to see that
Kamp be given his rightful place on the wall.
</P>
<P>
   It was not easy. Three times, Anderson submitted written
statements from doctors and nurses acknowledging that Kamp had died
as a result of his war wounds. Three times his request was rejected
by Marine Corps brass.
</P>
<P>
   A quadriplegic from wounds to the neck and chest, Kamp was in
and out of hospitals throughout his life with infections, pneumonia
and other respiratory and digestive problems, Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
   ''His lungs weren't strong enough to take in all the air,'' he
explained. ''He wouldn't have died at such a young age if he didn't
have so many complications due to his paralysis.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Anderson turned to the brother of a Marine he
befriended during basic training, Washington, D.C., attorney John
Dowd.
</P>
<P>
   ''He said, 'I've got a friend, a senator named John McCain,'''
Anderson said. ''McCain called the Marine Corps and a week later I
got a call and a letter saying that due to new documentation,
Dave's name is going to be put on the wall.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, a native of Portville, went to Vietnam in January 1967
as a Marine platoon leader with the Third Battalion, First Marine
Division. Kamp was his radio operator. Assigned on
search-and-destroy missions southwest of Da Nang, they worked
together constantly, Anderson said, and were partners in two-man
foxholes.
</P>
<P>
   Kamp saved Anderson's life, and perhaps the lives of others,
when the platoon was walking on a dike through a rice paddy one day
33 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''The radio man's always walking behind the platoon leader,''
Anderson said. ''Just as I got by, out of this plant pops this Viet
Cong and he had a weapon and was just about to open up on me and
the others. David Camp shot him.''
</P>
<P>
   That November, the platoon ''went afloat'' with the Third
Battalion.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was always a battalion afloat,'' he said, ''floating in
ships of the coast, making landings and doing operations wherever
they were needed.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, however, was assigned to serve as watch officer at
First Marine Division headquarters in Da Nang, monitoring reports
of firefights and operations. He was listening when his platoon was
sent in on an operation near Hue on Dec. 27.
</P>
<P>
   ''On the second night they were there, they got hit real bad,''
he said. ''A whole larger force came in. I'm hearing my platoon get
shot up, and that didn't make me feel very good.
</P>
<P>
   ''The firefight lasted 27 hours,'' he recalled, ''and every
officer in the company was killed. Dave was hit in the neck by an
AK-47 and took two rounds in the chest. He laid there five hours
before they could get him out.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson visited Kamp in Great Lakes (Mich.) Naval Hospital and
again after he went home to Muskegon.
</P>
<P>
   ''They expected him to live two years,'' Anderson said. ''He
fooled them all and lived 28{ years.''
</P>
<P>
   About 22 of Kamp's relatives and fellow platoon members plan to
attend the Memorial Day ceremony.

<HEADLINE> Wisconsin Adopts HMO Review Law  </HEADLINE>
By JR ROSS
<TEXT>
<P>
   OSHKOSH, Wis. (AP) -- People who are denied medical coverage will
have their appeals heard by state review boards rather than
insurance companies under a new Wisconsin law.
</P>
<P>
   Legislation signed Friday by Gov. Tommy Thompson will create
independent review boards that can order health maintenance
organizations (HMOs) and other insurers to pay for treatment that
the companies initially deny to patients.
</P>
<P>
   ''This will help make sure patients' concerns are heard,''
Thompson said. ''Now patients will have a way to fight for the care
they need.''
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin joins more than a dozen states that provide patients
with independent review of coverage decisions.
</P>
<P>
   The bill had the backing of both consumer groups and insurance
companies.
</P>
<P>
   The review panels will include specialists in medicine and will
have to make decisions about appeals within 30 days.
</P>
<P>
   ''What this legislation does is address a gap in the current law
related to medical decisions,'' said Connie O'Connell, the state
insurance commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation was prompted in part by a 1998 Associated Press
report about the difficulties some Wisconsin patients have in
resolving disputes with their HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin's new law is better than similar measures in other
states because it applies to all commercial health insurance, not
just HMOs, said Nancy Wenzel, executive director of the Wisconsin
Association of Health Plans, which represents HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   ''Wisconsin went beyond an external review proposal for just
managed care and instead said all health insurance patients should
have the same rights and protections,'' Wenzel said.

<HEADLINE> Mayor still mulling over whether he'll stay in Senate race  </HEADLINE>
By DONNA DE LA CRUZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Mayor Rudolph Giuliani says he's still mulling
over whether he'll remain in the U.S. Senate race or drop out
because of his prostate cancer and his personal problems.
</P>
<P>
   But the mayor on Friday promised a decision as soon as possible.
He made it clear that his health was priority No.1 when he talked
about possibly canceling a few events next week, including several
fund-raisers.
</P>
<P>
   ''If some things are canceled, that's the reason they're being
canceled,'' he said. ''There are things I couldn't do this week
that I'm going to have to do next week.''
</P>
<P>
   A fund-raising trip slated for several cities in California next
Tuesday and Wednesday was still tentative, but could easily be
rescheduled, said Giuliani campaign spokeswoman Juleanna Glover
Weiss.
</P>
<P>
   ''We still very much believe that he is running,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Giuliani has only two things on his campaign schedule in
the next few days -- a trip to Oneonta today for the Delaware County
Republican dinner and a Town Hall meeting next Thursday in
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   His supporters urged him not to abandon the race. During the
mayor's weekly radio show Friday, a caller who identified herself
as Susan from Brooklyn called Giuliani ''a national treasure.''
</P>
<P>
   Later in the show, Al from Long Island practically begged
Giuliani to stay in the Senate race against Democrat Hillary Rodham
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd like to call you Senator Giuliani because I think you
deserve it,'' Al said. ''I would hate to see you back down because
you're a real man. ... A man like yourself is hard to find.''
</P>
<P>
   Another caller, Michael from New Jersey, told Giuliani he should
finish his term as mayor, then run for governor.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think your talents would be wasted as a cog in the
slow-moving bureaucracy of the Senate,'' Michael said. ''I just
don't think you're suited for that, to be honest with you.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani told Michael other people have said the same thing to
him, and others have urged him to stay in the Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think being in the Senate would be a great honor and it
would be a great place to continue the kind of work that I've done
for the city of New York, and to spread it to the entire state, and
to some extent ... to the rest of the country,'' Giuliani said.
''And I think a change in role is good for you. I think people can
do a lot of different things in their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the mayor repeatedly said Friday he has not yet decided
whether to remain in the Senate race. But he did say he had a
responsibility to the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm going to make a decision as quickly as I can responsibly
make it,'' he told reporters at a bill-signing event. ''I do feel
that I have an obligation to the party.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani again cited his prostate cancer and his personal
problems as the main factors he's weighing, but refused to comment
further on either subject. The mayor publicly announced two weeks
ago he was diagnosed with prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Two days ago, he disclosed he was seeking a legal separation
from his wife of 16 years, Donna Hanover. Hanover responded by
dropping her own bombshell, alleging that their marital woes began
several years go over his relationship with a former press aide,
Cristyne Lategano-Nicholas.
</P>
<P>
   The tale of marital strife and alleged infidelity has filled
local papers for days, much to the mayor's dislike, and his
demeanor has been rather downcast. However, Oreo, a 7-month-old
Labrador puppy who licked Giuliani's face as he signed a bill
regarding the sterilization of dogs and cats adopted from shelters
or pet shops, seemed to perk him up a bit.
</P>
<P>
   As did one particular caller to his radio show.
</P>
<P>
   ''May all your problems be little ones,'' said Viola from
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ''Yeah, I agree with that,'' the mayor said.

<HEADLINE> Miss. Delta Employment Declines  </HEADLINE>
By MATT MOORE
<TEXT>
<P>
   LEXINGTON, Miss. (AP) -- In his 57 years of repairing shoes at
his small shop on a corner of the town square, J.C. Travis has seen
both extremes of the economy.
</P>
<P>
   There was a time, he recalled, when the work was so plentiful it
took ''three or four'' cobblers to meet the demand. Now, the
72-year-old man works alone. Unemployment in this mid-Delta town of
nearly 2,300 residents has climbed to 22.3 percent and shows no
signs of slowing.
</P>
<P>
   Residents say Lexington's future -- as with much of the
Mississippi Delta, where cotton once was king -- is bleak.
</P>
<P>
   ''A town without jobs is just about doomed,'' said Thomas
Johnson Jr., 52, as he sat in front of Sam's Grocery store on
Lexington's square. ''People here can't progress because they don't
have the work and they don't have the money.''
</P>
<P>
   Poverty and scarce jobs have long been a fact of life in the 15
counties that comprise the Mississippi Delta and mid-Delta.
</P>
<P>
   The region has nearly 387,000 residents -- 14 percent of
Mississippi's 2.7 million. During March, the number of unemployed
in the Delta represented 21.2 percent of the state's total jobless.
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment nationally was at 4.3 percent in March. In
Mississippi, it was 5.7 percent. Outside the Delta, unemployment
was as low as 1.5 percent in Lafayette, home to the University of
Mississippi, and 4.3 percent in the Jackson area.
</P>
<P>
   Like many small villages in the flat, soil-rich Delta to the
west, Lexington has changed little in the last decade. Downtown
clothing and variety shops have dwindled with the economy, leaving
empty storefronts.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Delta's new construction is limited to a handful of
counties along the Mississippi River where gambling is allowed.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's where the kids are going,'' said Laplause Polk, a
former economics teacher. ''There's nothing here to keep them.''
</P>
<P>
   On average, roughly 10 percent of the working age population is
unemployed each month, more than double the state average of 5
percent. The population's main source of income is federal
assistance payments, according to the state Department of Human
Services.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Wagoner, associate professor of economics at Delta State
University in Cleveland, said a resistance to technology and
manufacturing jobs some 50 years ago has helped fuel the region's
high jobless rates.
</P>
<P>
   ''They didn't want it basically because they thought it would
compete with their need for agriculture labor,'' Wagoner said.
''The industry never came.''
</P>
<P>
   The Delta's lack of adequate roads, bridges and a power grid
make it inhospitable to industry, Wagoner said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wouldn't want to build a plant here,'' he said. ''I couldn't
get my raw materials. People say we have the (Mississippi) River,
but so does St. Louis.''
</P>
<P>
   Elected leaders and state agency officials all point to the
Delta as the flashpoint for economic crisis. President Clinton this
month announced a $30 million initiative to promote economic
development in the area.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Spencer, a tire store owner who has been Lexington's
mayor for seven years, fears that ''unless we get some industry or
something back into the economy here, nothing's going to help.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We've got an available workforce -- I think most of them want
to work -- but there's nothing to do without leaving the town or the
county,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Athletics 9, Mariners 7  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Matt Stairs hit a three-run homer in the
ninth inning as the Oakland Athletics rallied from a five-run
deficit to beat the Seattle Mariners 9-7 on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland, which trailed 5-0 after three innings, was behind 7-6
entering the ninth. Pinch-hitter Terrence Long led off with a
single off Kazuhiro Sasaki (1-2) and moved to second on a sacrifice
bunt by Randy Velarde.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Giambi was intentionally walked setting up the
game-winning hit by Stairs, who got into the game when Olemdo Saenz
left in the second inning with a sprained left ankle.
</P>
<P>
   Stairs hit a 1-0 pitch over the fence in right-center for his
fifth home run. He threw his right hand in the air as he rounded
the bases.
</P>
<P>
   T.J. Mathews (2-2) got two outs for the win as Oakland moved
into sole possession of first place in the AL West this late in the
season for the first time since winning the division in 1992. The
A's lead Seattle by a half-game.
</P>
<P>
   Edgar Martinez hit a three-run homer and Alex Rodriguez drove in
three runs for Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Ramon Hernandez hit a two-run homer for the A's.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing 6-5, Seattle took the lead with two runs in the
seventh. Carlos Guillen walked to lead off the inning advanced to
second on a wild pitch and third on a groundout with two outs.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez tied the game with an infield single off Jeff Tam.
John Olerud followed with an RBI double off Mike Magnante to give
Seattle the 7-6 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland starter Omar Olivares allowed six runs on six hits and
four walks in six innings.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle starter John Halama allowed four runs, two hits and six
walks in four innings.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez gave the Mariners a 5-0 lead in the third with his
eighth home run of the season, a three-run shot off Olivares.
Rodriguez also doubled home a run in the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Jeremy Giambi doubled home a run in the fourth, the A's scored
three runs on one hit in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Halama gave up four walks and hit a batter to the first five
hitters of the inning. Velarde and Jason Giambi each walked with
the bases loaded. Ben Grieve also drove in a run with a single.
</P>
<P>
Notes: John Mabry was activated from the 15-day DL before the
game. ... Catcher Joe Oliver was optioned to Triple-A Tacoma. ...
Martinez extended his hitting streak to 11 games with a single in
the first inning. ... Olivares has allowed three home runs in his
last two starts after allowing one in his first six.

<HEADLINE> Police Clash With Mob in Jakarta  </HEADLINE>
By IRWAN FIRDAUS
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- Police fired tear gas and warning
shots at an angry mob of people in Chinatown on Saturday in a clash
that began when officials tried to remove street vendors from the
area's crowded sidewalks, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   As people fled the police assault, they threw rocks that broke
the windows of a McDonald's restaurant and a BMW dealership, and
set fire to at least one police motorcycle, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of people were arrested and taken away in police vans,
said police officer Pramono, who like many Indonesians uses only
one name.
</P>
<P>
   Several policemen were seen being treated for minor injuries,
and many of the shops in Chinatown closed to avoid the violence.
Hundreds of police lined the streets after the mob fled.
</P>
<P>
   By midday, the area's streets and sidewalks reopened to traffic
and pedestrians, but police remained on the scene.
</P>
<P>
   The attack occurred two years after a student-led, pro-democracy
movement's massive protests and riots forced President Suharto to
resign. Some of the violence targeted Indonesia's wealthy but small
Chinese minority, especially in Chinatown, where a shopping mall
was burned down.
</P>
<P>
   But police said the dispute Saturday did not seem to involve a
clash between Indonesia's majority Muslims and minority Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   Pramono said it began when local officials tried to clear the
sidewalks of the many vendors who gather there each day to sell
items such as pirated video compact discs, some of which contain
pornography.
</P>
<P>
   The vendors responded by throwing rocks and the small desks and
beach umbrellas they use to sell their products on the crowded
sidewalks, setting off the police attack, Pramono said.
</P>
<P>
   In the assault on the BMW dealership, the mob ransacked the
showroom and burned one of its computers, Pramono said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was not an anti-Chinese attack. This was just criminals
who illegally sell hot property in front of our shops,'' said
Johanes Wijaya, 50, an Indonesian-Chinese shopowner who rushed to
his electronics store in Chinatown when he heard about the
violence.
</P>
<P>
   Since coming to power in October, President Abdurrahman Wahid, a
reformist Muslim cleric, has promoted religious tolerance in
Indonesia and lifted a long-standing ban on public Chinese
festivities, such as the Chinese Lunar New Year in February.
</P>
<P>
   The government also now allows the minority to operate
Chinese-language schools and to use store signs written in Chinese
characters.

   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Hoping to contain Africa's newest war, the Security
Council demanded that Eritrea and Ethiopia immediately stop fighting and hinted
at a possible arms embargo if the conflict doesn't die down over the weekend. In
a resolution unanimously adopted Friday just hours after fighting along the
Eritrean-Ethiopian border flared, the council demanded the Horn of Africa
neighbors restart stalled peace talks that broke down last week. The resolution
said the council would meet again on Monday ''to take immediate steps to ensure
compliance with this resolution'' if fighting continues.

shift from a day earlier, when the guerrillas had decided against freeing them,
said a negotiator, who spoke on the condition he not be named. Contacts with the

separatist guerrillas delivered seven letters their captives had written to

Study Questions 'Sex Reassignment'

   BALTIMORE (AP) -- The practice of surgically ''reassigning'' boys born
without penises is being called into question by a new study that suggests
gender identity is determined in the womb. Researchers at the Johns Hopkins
Hospital on Friday said the study found that such boys, raised as girls, had
masculine behavior and most declared themselves to be boys. The results
contradicted a Canadian study published in the journal Pediatrics in 1998 that
suggested gender identity develops after birth. In that study, researchers found
that a boy who was raised as a girl after his penis was mutilated during
circumcision continued to live as a woman.

<HEADLINE> Red Sox 9, Orioles 0  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GINSBURG
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE (AP) -- By the end of the game, even the Baltimore fans
were cheering for Pedro Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   Not long after that, several players and both managers applauded
the performance with superlatives that served as a testament to his
greatness.
</P>
<P>
   A well-rested Martinez marked his return from a five-game
suspension by pitching a two-hitter and striking out 15 as the
Boston Red Sox beat the slumping Baltimore Orioles 9-0.
</P>
<P>
   Pitching for the first time since May 6, Martinez (6-1) allowed
only two baserunners. He retired the first 12 batters before Albert
Belle led off the fifth inning with an opposite-field single. After
Jeff Conine hit a one-out single, Martinez recorded 14 straight
outs.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was the best display of pitching I've ever been a part
of,'' Boston catcher Jason Varitek said.
</P>
<P>
   ''If he pitches like this all year, he'll win 30 games. That's
as dominating as I've ever seen him,'' Baltimore manager Mike
Hargrove said. ''He's obviously the best in baseball today, and
pitched like it tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't the first time a Hargrove team has been beaten by
the talented right-hander. The manager also took his share of lumps
in the 1990s while in charge of the Cleveland Indians.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't I've ever seen anybody be this consistently dominant
for this long,'' Hargrove said. ''This guy's better than Randy
Johnson, I think. He's pitching as well as I've seen anybody
pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, the 1999 Cy Young winner, was suspended for hitting
Cleveland's Roberto Alomar with a pitch on April 30. Martinez
struck out 17 in a 1-0 loss to Tampa Bay on May 6, then dropped his
appeal of the suspension and served the five days, which pushed
back his start by one day.
</P>
<P>
   ''Gee, I'm sure glad he got suspended,'' Hargrove deadpanned.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he intended to make a statement to Frank Robinson, who
levied the suspension, Martinez replied, ''I don't have anything to
prove to him. He understands the way I am and he understands about
baseball. ... I'm just here to pitch, do my job and go home and be
happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez returned in top form, going to 2-0 on only two batters
in lowering his ERA to 1.01. The 32 strikeouts in two games tied
the AL record set in 1968 by Cleveland's Luis Tiant.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the game, with the home team hopelessly trailing
by nine runs, the Baltimore fans yelled after every strike.
</P>
<P>
   ''Not only are they rooting for their team but they're rooting
for the good things that happen in baseball and they recognize it
and clap for it,'' Martinez said. ''It's really nice to see that. I
can tell now that this is a baseball town.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Martinez's first shutout of the year and 12th of his
career. He has struck out at least 10 batters five times this
season and has done it 59 times lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Bordick and Greg Myers struck out three times and every
Baltimore starter fanned at least once. It was the first shutout
loss of the season for the Orioles, who have dropped five straight
and nine of 10.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez went out with a bang, striking out six of the final
seven hitters. He struck out the side in the eighth, ending the
inning with a 97 mph fastball that disposed of Mark Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was throwing just as hard at the end as he was at the
beginning. He never lost anything,'' Lewis said.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was a very special performance. It just doesn't get any
better, I don't think,'' Boston manager Jimy Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Offerman and Brian Daubach provided more than enough
offense for Martinez -- Offerman went 4-for-5 with a homer and two
RBIs, and Daubach had a homer and four RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   Sidney Ponson (2-2) gave up five runs and 11 hits in eight
innings. He gave up a run before getting an out in the first, and
that proved to be enough offense for Martinez, who threw strikes on
77 of his 113 pitches.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Martinez has not lost consecutive games since 1998. He has
won 12 of his last 14 starts. ... Belle was 0-for-13 with seven
strikeouts against Martinez before his hit. ... Boston's Mike
Stanley snapped an 0-for-18 skid with singles in the sixth and
eighth.

<HEADLINE> Hurst Credits Concentration, Caddie  </HEADLINE>
By TERESA M. WALKER
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKLIN, Tenn. (AP) -- Pat Hurst has the perfect remedy for
playing a course new to the LPGA Tour: a caddie who is a quick
study.
</P>
<P>
   ''My caddie has figured it out,'' Hurst said after shooting a
4-under-par 68 Friday for a six-stroke lead and an 11-under 133
total after two rounds of the Electrolux USA Championship, a new
tournament at The Legends Club.
</P>
<P>
   ''I only played this course once in the pro-am. He tells me
where to hit it, how far, whether to use 3-wood or bang a driver.
He keeps me in the right direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Reminded that some players don't like to admit they rely heavily
on their caddie, Hurst answered that Dan Wilson has been perfect
through 36 holes on estimating yardages.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's been dead-on for every club. That gives me a lot of
confidence. I know I've got the right club in my hand, because he
hasn't missed yet,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Hurst is playing her best golf since giving birth to her first
son last June. Part of the reason is changes she made in correcting
her swing back to a fade from a draw she first started using during
pregnancy. She also has been using a crosshanded grip for putting
the past month.
</P>
<P>
   And it doesn't hurt to have a caddie who knows his job. Hurst
hooked up with Wilson, who used to caddie for Dottie Pepper, in
March.
</P>
<P>
   That combination has helped her turn in an eagle, 11 birdies and
only two bogeys in leading the first two rounds.
</P>
<P>
   Cindy Figg-Currier (72) and Michelle Redman (69) were tied for
second at 5-under 139. Karrie Webb (67), Jeong Jang (67), Michelle
McGann (69), Mhairi McKay (71) and Mary Beth Zimmerman (70) were at
140, and Juli Inkster was among three at 141. Nancy Lopez was among
the 76 who survived the cut at 148.
</P>
<P>
   The ability to concentrate also has aided Hurst, whose last tour
victory was the 1998 Nabisco Dinah Shore. Winds have gusted between
20 and 25 mph the first two days, reminding Hurst of growing up in
San Francisco, where the winds blew in every afternoon off the bay.
</P>
<P>
   ''As long as you don't get down saying, 'My God, it's windy out
here. I can't believe it,' it really makes you concentrate. It
makes you think each shot,'' she said. ''You're focusing on each
shot, because you know you have to.''
</P>
<P>
   Hurst started slowly on the back nine with four straight pars
before taking advantage of the par-5 14th. She hit a lob wedge to 4
feet, setting up her first birdie. Her longest birdie putt came on
the par-4 No. 15 after an 8-iron left her six feet short.
</P>
<P>
   She ran into trouble on No. 18 when she hit her second shot into
the water and couldn't get up and down for only her second bogey
through the first 36 holes.
</P>
<P>
   Webb rebounded from her second-worst round this year, an opening
73, with six birdies and one bogey, and she could've been closer if
she hadn't lipped out a birdie putt on the 18th.
</P>
<P>
   When Webb shot a second-round 75 in January, she wound up
winning The Office Depot tournament. She is looking for her fifth
LPGA Tour victory this year and seventh overall, and said her
confidence is just fine.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd be foolish to think I couldn't still play well,'' she
said. ''I'm in red numbers at least, so we'll see what happens this
weekend.''
Divots: Courtney Wood, a 17-year-old amateur, was among the 76
golfers who survived the cut at 148. The Nashville native, who has
a scholarship to TCU, was at 147. ... Five golfers withdrew on
Friday due to a variety of injuries, but the worst was Pearl Sinn.
She opened with a 78, but had to be carted off the course Friday
because of her allergy to fescue grass, which makes up the rough.
She had such bad hives her eyes swelled shut.

<HEADLINE> Dallas, Colorado Meet in Finals  </HEADLINE>
By JAIME ARON
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- The Dallas Stars went through the first 2{ months
this season stuck in a fog of injuries and inconsistent play. The
Colorado Avalanche needed even longer to work our their kinks.
</P>
<P>
   But here they are, meeting tonight to start the Western
Conference finals for the second straight year. And, whichever team
is left standing will likely be the favorite to win the Stanley
Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas won the title last season and is obsessed with defending
it. Colorado, though, is just as focused on winning, with the added
incentive of getting Ray Bourque's name on the trophy for the first
time in his long, stellar career.
</P>
<P>
   ''Colorado has a lot of intangibles -- Ray Bourque and things
like that -- but I think we're a determined group, too,'' Stars
center Joe Nieuwendyk said. ''We want to keep the Cup, so it's
going to be a heck of a series.''
</P>
<P>
   Their early season struggles are among many traits the teams
share.
</P>
<P>
   Both have great goalies, superb centers and depth on defense.
Their special teams truly are special. Even their record this
postseason is the same, at home (6-0) and on the road (2-2).
</P>
<P>
   ''It comes down to discipline and making sure that you're
patient,'' Colorado coach Bob Hartley said. ''You can't be
impatient against a quality team like Dallas.''
</P>
<P>
   Dallas' top two lines are led by Mike Modano and Nieuwendyk, who
has begun showing why he was the MVP of last year's playoffs. Right
wing Brett Hull, though, is the leading playoff scorer on both
teams with 12 points.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado's attack is keyed by centers Peter Forsberg and Joe
Sakic, the MVP of the 1996 postseason. However, their leading
scorer so far has been right wing Adam Deadmarsh with 11 points.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Roy, the winningest goalie in postseason history, is
playing as well as he did in '96, when he led the Avs to the third
Cup of his career. Dallas' Ed Belfour has been even better than
last season, when he and the Stars each won their first Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Great defense has helped both goalies. Dallas is allowing 24.6
shots per game; Colorado 26.1.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been a great playoffs so far for me, but I don't want to
look at that now,'' Roy said. ''We're only halfway.''
</P>
<P>
   Special teams are practically a wash, too. Colorado has more
power-play goals, while Dallas has more penalty kills.
</P>
<P>
   Bourque, a key part of the Avs' power play, missed the last two
games of the second round with a knee injury, but he's expected to
return. Dallas expects to have forward Jere Lehtinen back and on
the penalty kill for the first time this postseason.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line is there are no clear advantages for either
team.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't see us saying, 'Look, we can take advantage of this
player or we can take advantage of that,''' Stars coach Ken
Hitchcock said. ''We've spent very little time talking about
anything they do on the ice, because we know we're just going to
have to be perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   There is one thing in Dallas' favor going into the series: home
ice.
</P>
<P>
   The Avalanche won the opener at Reunion Arena last year, but the
Stars won a game in Denver and ended up clinching the series with a
Game 7 win at home.
</P>
<P>
   ''It doesn't matter if it's five, six or seven games, you have
to expect hard-fought battles every night,'' Modano said. ''But if
it goes seven, then it fits us, because that game is in Dallas. It
helped us last year.''

<HEADLINE> Devils-Flyers Head To Finals  </HEADLINE>
By TOM CANAVAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST ORANGE, N.J. (AP) -- A quick look at the statistics explains
why the New Jersey Devils are so concerned about the Philadelphia
Flyers' power play heading into the Eastern Conference final.
</P>
<P>
   The Flyers have scored 29 goals in the postseason. Thirteen have
come with the man advantage, or roughly 45 percent of their
offense.
</P>
<P>
   If the Devils shut down the power play, chances are good they
will be going to the Stanley Cup final once the best-of-seven
series is finished.
</P>
<P>
   That's why the Flyers should be worried. Heading into Game 1 on
Sunday, New Jersey has the NHL's top penalty killing unit in the
postseason. The Devils have killed off 33 of 34 short-handed
chances, including the last 23.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto failed on all 20 of its power plays in the conference
semifinal.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't ever feel we're on a roll,'' said Devils rookie John
Madden, who set a team record with six short-handed goals this
season. ''Obviously we know we are doing well in the 'PK'
department, but we have to keep paying attention to detail and
watching more video and focusing in on their players.''
</P>
<P>
   The Flyers will try to get John LeClair in front of goaltender
Martin Brodeur and get shots from the points from defensemen Eric
Desjardins and Andy Delmore, who has five goals in 11 playoff games
after having just two in 27 regular-season contests.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're a shooting power play,'' Devils defenseman Scott
Stevens said. ''They have size in front with LeClair and (Keith)
Primeau and they got (Mark) Recchi to set it up and they got good
shooters at the point. I think their main thing will be to get the
puck to the point and get it on net and get shots and tips.''
</P>
<P>
   Primeau's status for Sunday is uncertain because of a concussion
sustained in the Flyers' series clincher against Pittsburgh on
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils will use an aggressive approach to their penalty
killing, trying to keep Philadelphia out of the offensive zone.
</P>
<P>
   Madden and Jay Pandolfo have been good at breaking up plays and
Stevens and Ken Daneyko have been stopping forwards trying to enter
the zone.
</P>
<P>
   That's forced opponents to dump the puck in a lot, which can be
a major mistake because Brodeur is probably the league's best
puck-handling goalie. As fast as the Maple Leafs dumped the puck in
the Devils' zone, Brodeur flipped it back out.
</P>
<P>
   ''When a team pretty much has to think about where it's going to
dump the puck while someone is in their face, it's pretty hard to
do,'' Stevens said. ''You tend to make mistakes. They know they
have to keep the puck away from Marty ... Marty is good at grabbing
the puck and getting it out.''
</P>
<P>
   If Philadelphia gets the puck into the offensive zone, the
Devils will try to prevent the Flyers from passing it around by
attacking the puck carrier.
</P>
<P>
   During the regular season, the Devils won the special teams
battle with the Flyers in winning four of five games. Philadelphia,
which converted on 20.3 percent of its power plays in the regular
season, was 2-for-21 with the man advantage against New Jersey, or
9.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey actually had a better power play, converting on
4-for-17, or 23.5 percent.

<HEADLINE> Fire Near Grand Canyon Slows  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND CANYON NATIONAL PARK, Ariz. (AP) -- Calmer winds aided
firefighters as a 7,000-acre wildfire on the North Rim of the Grand
Canyon slowed.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is not spreading rapidly,'' Grand Canyon National Park
spokesman Tom Pittenger said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Reduced wind gave firefighters a break after the bluster earlier
this week.
</P>
<P>
   The Outlet fire, like the devastating fire raging in New Mexico,
began as a prescribed burn on April 25, designed to help remove
some of the brush and grasses on about 1,500 acres. Park officials
had hoped the fire would rejuvenate the forested areas and prevent
large wildfires.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, however, strong winds drove the fire out of the
prescribed area and by Thursday, it had spread into Kaibab National
Forest to the north.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the fire continued to move north, away from stores,
housing and the North Rim Lodge. Firefighters were using the
opportunity to dig lines and clear debris around the developed
areas, said Carol Tepper, a park spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Pittenger said the fire was never closer than three to four
miles from the developed area.
</P>
<P>
   About 230 firefighters and support personnel were working the
fire, and 350 more had been requested. A helicopter, three aerial
tankers and a lead plane also aided the effort, park officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   The South Rim of the Grand Canyon, the side on which the vast
majority of visitors go, remained open, though some light smoke
could be seen and smelled, Tepper said.

<HEADLINE> More Peacekeepers in Sierra Leone  </HEADLINE>
By CLARENCE ROY-MACAULAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) -- Fresh troops arrived in Sierra
Leone's capital as the president paid homage to 19 people killed
during a recent demonstration against rebel troops who resumed
fighting.
</P>
<P>
   A few hundred more Jordanian soldiers arrived Friday to help
shore up the beleaguered U.N. peacekeeping force in Freetown, where
as many as 30,000 refugees gathered to escape attacks by an
advancing guerrilla army.
</P>
<P>
   During the service for the 19 killed, President Ahmed Tejan
Kabbah said the rebels who broke a peace deal and resumed fighting
the government can ''never be trusted.''
</P>
<P>
   With the coffins containing the victims lined before him, Kabbah
told more than 10,000 people crowded into the national stadium that
the Revolutionary United Front rebels had intended to overthrow the
government when they opened fire Monday on unarmed demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
   ''Their deaths have revealed evidence of wickedness toward the
government,'' Kabbah said. ''One lesson the events of last Monday
have taught me is: One should never trust anybody called a rebel.''
</P>
<P>
   The declaration was a sharp contrast to the conviviality on
display in July when Kabbah and rebel leader Foday Sankoh signed a
peace accord ending a brutal eight-year civil war that not only
left thousands dead but included the maiming and mutilation of
thousands of Sierra Leonean men, women and children.
</P>
<P>
   The peace accord, already imperiled when rebels took 500
peacekeepers hostage last week, was tattered further when
bodyguards for rebel leader Foday Sankoh began shooting in crowds
of peace demonstrators in front of Sankoh's home Monday.
</P>
<P>
   A two-hour gun battle between the rebels and government soldiers
erupted, during which some of the victims were slain by rebels
execution-style. Sankoh disappeared and his whereabouts remain
unknown.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen civilians and six soldiers were killed, some by gunshot
and mortar wounds, others when they were trampled by the panicked,
stampeding crowd. The oldest fatality was a 60-year-old journalist;
the youngest, a 16-year-old schoolboy.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands lined the route leading from the stadium as the
coffins containing the remains of the civilians -- each draped with
Sierra Leone's green, white and blue flag -- were transported aboard
an open trailer to a cemetery at Kissy, on the eastern outskirts of
the capital. The soldiers were buried at a military cemetery on the
opposite side of the city.
</P>
<P>
   Despite calls from African countries to let United Nations
peacekeepers use more force against the rebels, there was little
indication Friday that the U.N. Security Council wanted to play a
more active combat role in the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Council members have instead focused on reinforcing troops on
the ground with better trained and equipped battalions who could
help salvage what remains of the peace deal, European and American
diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
   Peacekeepers are currently authorized to use force to protect
themselves and civilians in danger but have refrained from any
offensive attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, British Defense Secretary Geoff Hoon said the
presence of British troops has partly been responsible for a
''calming in the situation'' in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
   He said the British are being bolstered by other forces -- and
that that will eventually signal a British departure.
</P>
<P>
   ''We now see the Jordanian forces arrive, and we will see
further forces arriving in due course. That does mean that we will
have completed our responsibilities there -- we will have kept the
lifeline open, we will have given confidence to the U.N. forces and
we will have seen a real difference on the ground,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''That is a substantial achievement for British forces,'' he
said.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Rebels Mull Release  </HEADLINE>
By JIM GOMEZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOLO, Philippines (AP) -- Muslim rebels holding 21 hostages in
the Philippine jungle said Saturday that they would consider
releasing two ailing captives.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, negotiators said they had reached an
''understanding'' with the Abu Sayyaf rebels that a sick German
woman and perhaps even a French man would be freed later in the
day.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is some kind of understanding, but of course they can
always change their mind,'' said negotiator Robert Aventajado.
''Nothing is 100 percent in this kind of situation.''
</P>
<P>
   The Abu Sayyaf rebels' willingness to consider the release
appeared to be a positive shift from a day earlier, when the
guerrillas had decided against freeing them.
</P>
<P>
   Abdul Rajab Azzarouq, a former Libyan ambassador to the
Philippines who is helping negotiate, left Jolo city Saturday to
meet with the rebels to follow up on the possible release, the
negotiator said.
</P>
<P>
   Contacts with the rebels, broken since Wednesday, were
re-established Friday night when the separatist guerrillas
delivered seven letters their captives had written to loved ones.
</P>
<P>
   Azzarouq called the delivery of letters written by the hostages
to their loved ones ''a gesture which I hope will lead to a
breakthrough.''
</P>
<P>
   But the nearly three-week hostage crisis appeared to be far from
over.
</P>
<P>
   The leader of the Abu Sayyaf guerrilla group said the hostages --
who include 10 Westerners -- had been moved by the rebels to a new
''safe place'' much deeper in the mountains of remote Jolo Island.
The rebels also rejected the government's proposed negotiating
team, demanding to deal only with people of their own choosing.
</P>
<P>
   If President Joseph Estrada refuses, said rebel leader Abu
Escobar, ''we are prepared to hold on to the hostages for a long
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Azzarouq met Wednesday with the rebels and asked for two sick
hostages -- a French man and a German woman -- to be released. The
rebels said they would reply Thursday, but movements by government
troops near the planned meeting place apparently spooked the rebels
and they never appeared, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiator Robert Aventajado, an adviser to Estrada, ordered the
military to pull further back Friday to prevent a reoccurrence, and
the envoys made brief contact late in the day.
</P>
<P>
   Abu Escobar, a rebel leader, said Friday that the group had
decided not to release the two hostages -- Renate Wallert, a German
woman with hypertension, and Stephane Loisy, a French man with a
urinary tract infection.
</P>
<P>
   Officials would not read the hostages' letters to reporters,
saying they were personal. They described one from Wallert's son,
Marc, as thanking everyone for exerting efforts on the hostages'
behalf.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels have yet to present a list of formal demands, and
will do so only to the negotiators they have specified, Escobar
said.
</P>
<P>
   Informally, however, they have said they want independence for
the region, the establishment of Islamic law, a return to barter
trade, and a ban on foreign fishing boats.
</P>
<P>
   The hostages -- three Germans, two French citizens, two South
Africans, two Finns, a Lebanese, nine Malaysians and two Filipinos
-- were kidnapped April 23 from Malaysia's Sipadan Island and taken
to Jolo, an island at the tip of the southern Philippines about an
hour away.
</P>
<P>
   Abu Sayyaf, the smaller and more extreme of two Muslim rebel
groups in the southern Philippines, is also holding a separate
group of Filipino hostages in nearby Basilan province. They seized
those hostages, many of whom are children, on March 20 from two
schools.
</P>
<P>
   The military overran the rebels' stronghold in Basilan last
month and later rescued 15 hostages. Four others were killed and
eight are believed to still be in rebel hands.

<HEADLINE> Big Game Winner Reacts To Jackpot  </HEADLINE>
By KATHY BARKS HOFFMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- Having millions of dollars to his name
means swimming-pool installer Larry Ross can retire, buy a boat,
buy a house -- maybe even that purple Jaguar his wife always wanted.
</P>
<P>
   But the newest winner of the Big Game lottery jackpot also
realizes his winning ticket doesn't gain him admission to a
worry-free life.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have the ecstasy of winning and then you start realizing
the agony of what might happen,'' he said Friday after coming
forward with his wife and three children to claim half of the
record-breaking $363 million jackpot.
</P>
<P>
   ''You've got security problems now. You think about your family,
who's at risk. We're not in a secure neighborhood. We don't have
security like rich people have.''
</P>
<P>
   Ross, a 47-year-old occasional lottery player accustomed to
working 80 to 100 hours a week in the summer, said he and his
family hope to be able to weather the media attention until his
youngest child finishes seventh grade next month. Then they plan to
move from their four-bedroom ranch in the Detroit suburb of Shelby
Township to a more secure neighborhood somewhere in Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   Ross and his wife, Nancy, will take their share of the bounty in
a lump-sum payment of about $90 million before taxes. After the
lottery deducts 28 percent for federal taxes and 4.2 percent in
state income taxes, the Rosses will get about $61.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   Ross said he plans to give some of the money to charity.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not going to do anything rash. We're going to invest
wisely,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The other winning Big Game ticket was sold in Lake Zurich, Ill.,
30 miles northwest of Chicago. That winner has not yet come
forward.
</P>
<P>
   Ross bought his ticket to Tuesday's drawing at Mr. K's Party
Shoppe near Utica, 20 miles north of Detroit. He had stopped in to
buy a hot dog, and all he had was a $100 bill. At his wife's
urging, ''I asked the guy to give me change in lotto tickets,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Rosses have been married 25 years. Their children are: Ian,
21, Eric, 25, Shannon, 12.
</P>
<P>
   Ross said he wrote down the winning numbers incorrectly Tuesday
night on the way home and didn't realize he was a winner until
Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   After he saw the winning numbers on television, ''I invented a
new dance -- I started doing the lottery dance.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Ross says he hasn't slept or eaten in three days.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a great diet program: win the lotto and lose weight,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The $363 million jackpot was the richest in U.S. history and
easily topped the previous record, a $295.7 million Powerball
jackpot split two years ago by 13 machinists in Westerville, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   The Big Game's biggest individual payout remains the $197
million awarded last year to a Massachusetts woman. The Big Game is
played in Georgia, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New
Jersey and Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   The world lottery record is $1.2 billion, set in December by
Spain's El Gordo, or the Fat One, but that game awards thousands of
prizes.

<HEADLINE> Indiana Trustees To Meet on Knight  </HEADLINE>
By STEVE HERMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- After three decades, Bob Knight's explosive
temper may finally have engulfed his career as the controversy over
his behavior grows.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana University trustees will meet Sunday to sort through a
list of accusations that seems to grow daily against the Hall of
Fame coach whose outbursts often obscure his accomplishments.
</P>
<P>
   Charges of physical intimidation of players, staff and school
officials, some going back more than 20 years, surfaced after
former player Neil Reed claimed he was choked by Knight. A
videotape of that incident was leaked to the news media in March.
</P>
<P>
   The trustees will meet amid growing speculation they will
consider asking Knight to resign rather than force a showdown that
could lead to his dismissal. University officials Friday denied one
report that four of nine board members already are prepared to
recommend Knight be fired. Several Indiana players said they also
would leave the team if Knight is forced out.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is incorrect to suggest that Indiana University has reached
a decision in its review of allegations concerning basketball coach
Bob Knight,'' said vice president Christopher Simpson, a spokesman
for university president Myles Brand. ''It is also incorrect to
suggest that the scope of the review has been expanded. No
decisions can be reached until that review is complete.''
</P>
<P>
   Simpson said he did not expect a major announcement after
Sunday's meeting. Although trustees might meet privately to discuss
personnel matters, they can take official action only in public
meetings, which require 48 hours notice, excluding weekends.
</P>
<P>
   Brand gave the trustees 90 days to complete the investigation,
and Simpson said it is expected to be finished well before the June
20 deadline. Knight's contract with the university gives Brand the
power to fire him for cause if the Indiana athletic director
recommends it.
</P>
<P>
   Since the investigation began in March, there have been reports
of fights involving Knight and a former assistant coach, the
athletic director and the university's sports information director.
A secretary in the athletic department this week also said an
enraged Knight once threw a vase in her direction and more recently
stormed into a waiting area, swore at her and came toward her in
anger before athletic director Clarence Doninger restrained him.
</P>
<P>
   Indianapolis television station WRTV reported Thursday that
Knight attacked sports information director Kit Klingelhoffer more
than 20 years ago during a confrontation over a news release.
Klingelhoffer was knocked out, the station reported.
</P>
<P>
   Klingelhoffer would not comment when contacted Thursday by The
Associated Press, but a former athletic department secretary said
Friday she saw Knight attack Klingelhoffer and then storm out.
</P>
<P>
   ''We just sat there for awhile and then we all just went back to
work, and nobody ever said a thing about it,'' Terry Cagle told
WRTV by phone from Searsport, Maine.
</P>
<P>
   Butch Carter, a former player and now the Toronto Raptors'
coach, said Knight told a black player in 1980 that he would end up
like ''all the rest of the niggers in Chicago.'' Other players
there at the time have said they never heard Knight use the racial
slur.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Felling, the former assistant coach fired in December just
days after the reported altercation with Knight, would not confirm
speculation he was the source of the tape showing Knight grabbing
Reed by the throat. Earlier, IU associate athletic director Steve
Downing, a former player for Knight, said Felling told him he kept
the tape since 1997 for possible use as his ''trump card.''
</P>
<P>
   Felling said he was not interviewed by the two trustees
appointed by Brand to lead the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I've got anything to say, it should probably be said to the
proper people. I guess it would be the investigative committee, if
they're going to talk to me. I don't know when they are or not,''
he told The Associated Press on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Felling also would not say whether he is considering a lawsuit
against the university or Knight, or whether anyone representing
the university tried to contact him since the investigation began.
</P>
<P>
   Later Friday, Felling's attorney, Bill Potter, denied reports
that Felling also abused Indiana players.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Tom Geyer told Indianapolis television station WTHR that
Felling once slapped Luke Recker across the face and later pushed
Geyer and Kirk Haston to the floor during a workout.
</P>
<P>
   ''Regulations that apply to faculty members do not apply to the
head basketball coach when he is working in his capacity as head
basketball coach,'' Simpson told The Star.
</P>
<P>
   WRTV also reported Thursday night that four of nine members on
the university's board of trustees already are prepared to
recommend Knight be fired. Three support the coach, and two are
undecided, WRTV said.
</P>
<P>
   John Walda, president of the trustees and one of the two leading
the investigation, called a source story that the board already is
considering asking Knight to resign ''pure speculation.''
</P>
<P>
   ''There are only a few people involved in the decision-making
process, and obviously this unnamed source is not one of them,'' he
told The Fort Wayne Journal-Gazette. ''Whoever that source is has
no way of saying that accurately.''
</P>
<P>
   Indianapolis radio station WIBC reported Knight planned to meet
with Brand on Sunday. However, Simpson, who has spoken for Brand
throughout the investigation, told the AP, ''If there were a
meeting scheduled I would think I'd be aware of it. I'm not aware
any such meeting has been scheduled.''

<HEADLINE> Los Alamos Fire Is Still Raging  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN MacDONALD
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ALAMOS, N.M. (AP) -- The blowtorch winds and searing heat
that fed a raging wildfire broke Friday, easing the threat to Los
Alamos from a blaze that destroyed 260 homes, damaged the town's
nuclear weapons laboratory and forced 25,000 people to flee.
</P>
<P>
   The fire remained out of control in the nearby forests and
canyons, however, and residents were told they could not return to
their houses for at least a week.
</P>
<P>
   ''This fire is not over with and nobody here is pretending it
is,'' Gov. Gary Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   As the night wore on firefighters started to gain some ground.
Fire information officer Martin Chavez said the blaze was about 5
percent contained by late Friday. ''It's just kind of meandering
around,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The blaze began as a government-prescribed burn to clear brush
but exploded in size, fueled by dry weather, temperatures around 90
and wind gusts of more than 50 mph. Interior Secretary Bruce
Babbitt said Friday the government would suspend burns in the dry
Western states for 30 days.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those who fled Los Alamos on Wednesday faced the anxiety
of not knowing whether their homes were still standing. The blaze
swept through some homes like a flaming scythe, while neighboring
homes were left unscathed. No one was injured, however.
</P>
<P>
   In a Red Cross shelter at a high school in Santa Fe, anxious
residents crowded around TV sets, watching round-the-clock news
footage to see whether their homes were still there. Others logged
on to four computers at the shelter to scan a list posted on the
county Web site of destroyed houses.
</P>
<P>
   A few dialed their home numbers. A busy signal was taken as a
bad sign.
</P>
<P>
   ''We called our home and it was ringing, and we called a few of
our relatives' homes and it was ringing. We felt that's a good
indication our houses are still standing,'' said James Robinson,
who sat at the shelter with his wife and five children, the
youngest 13 months old.
</P>
<P>
   Relief workers had planned to escort some residents to their
homes Saturday to pick up clothes, medicine and other belongings
but later decided the town remained too unsafe.
</P>
<P>
   Across New Mexico, months of drought have left the state tinder
dry. More than 200,000 acres have burned already -- nearly four
times the total for all of last year -- and the fire season has just
begun.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly 200 miles to the south, a fire in the Sacramento
Mountains, sparked by a downed power line, blew up to 20,000 acres
Friday, rivaling the Los Alamos fire.
</P>
<P>
   The blaze forced the evacuation of more than 125 people in the
tiny towns of Sacramento and Weed. At least 20 homes and other
structures burned in Weed, a rural ranching hamlet where a highway
sign reads: ''Welcome to Weed. Population 20.''
</P>
<P>
   The break in the weather in northern New Mexico gave
firefighters hope of holding the line against the Los Alamos fire.
It was still growing Friday, but at a slower pace, and firefighters
expected winds to remain calm through Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Crews used bulldozers and hand tools to cut brush and dig
trenches in still-standing neighborhoods, fearful the flames still
might take an unexpected turn. Overnight, other crews took
advantage of lower temperatures and higher humidity to burn trees,
grass and brush about five miles from town, hoping to deprive the
fire of fuel.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can say with a high degree of confidence that we will not
have more structures burned in Los Alamos or White Rock,'' said
Doug MacDonald, the Los Alamos fire chief.
</P>
<P>
   The blaze was deliberately set May 4 to destroy brush at
Bandelier National Monument, but it raged out of control and swept
through about 33,000 acres by Friday. Roy Weaver, the Bandelier
superintendent who gave the go-ahead for the burn despite an
ominous weather forecast, was placed on leave with pay Thursday
pending an investigation. Officials expect to receive a report on
the cause of the fire next Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Los Alamos was framed by destruction, with houses reduced to
charred rubble and twisted metal. In one driveway, the fiberglass
shell of a sports car had fused with the concrete. In another yard,
a melted Big Wheel sat next to the seared remnants of a children's
playset.
</P>
<P>
   Residents and firefighters spoke with the imagery of war, using
words like ''attacked'' to describe the struggle with the fire,
which at one time surged so ferociously that firefighters dropped
their hoses and equipment and ran for safety.
</P>
<P>
   ''It came roaring down like a freight train off the mountain,''
said Ed Pullian, a battalion chief who had slept just seven hours
over three nights. ''We didn't have a chance. We kept retreating,
retreating, retreating and kept getting overrun.''
</P>
<P>
   Los Alamos, 70 miles north of Albuquerque, is essentially a
company town for the nuclear laboratory, which employs 7,000 people
at buildings scattered throughout the city. It was the base of
operations in the 1940s for the Manhattan Project, which built the
atomic bomb.
</P>
<P>
   At the weapons lab, flames burned trailers and portable
buildings and came within 300 yards of a plutonium storage
facility. But lab officials insisted that dangerous materials were
protected in facilities strong enough to withstand the crash of a
747.
</P>
<P>
   By Friday, the lab appeared out of danger, and all of the
facility's major buildings were unscathed, said Richard Burick,
deputy lab director for operations.
</P>
<P>
   Lab Director John Browne said late Friday that the lab will
resume limited operations Monday to plan for a phased reopening.
</P>
<P>
   The fire ''was just short'' of reaching a hazardous waste area
in nearby White Rock, Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said when
questioned by a reporter in San Diego. He added, ''but there's been
no damage, there's been no problem, but we're monitoring the
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Schumann, an official with the lab, had expressed concern
that there was potential danger posed by the area, where asbestos,
low-level radioactive waste and PCBs are stored in steel drums and
fiberglass compound containers.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance agents had arrived near Los Alamos to begin the
monumental process of sorting claims. State officials have
suggested the costs could go as high as $1 billion, and there has
already been talk of federal compensation for the fire that got out
of hand.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're a small town, and I can go along one street and see all
my friends who've lost their houses -- eight or 10 in a row,'' said
a teary-eyed Lawry Mann, chairman of the Los Alamos County Council.
''We've done it before, we've come through tough times before, and
Los Alamos will rise again.''

<HEADLINE> Spike Lee employee alleges discrimination in pat-down searches  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY NEUMEISTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- An employee of filmmaker Spike Lee says she was
degraded and humiliated when she was unfairly singled out by U.S.
Customs agents for a humiliating full-body pat-down after returning
from a plane trip abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ''Their intrusive, sexually degrading, biased practices must
stop,'' Yvette Bradley told a Manhattan news conference Friday as
she described what she experienced on April 5, 1999 when she
arrived at Newark International Airport shortly before 10 p.m. from
a trip to Jamaica with her sister.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was degraded and my body was treated as if it had no
value,'' the 33-year-old Manhattan resident said of a search by
U.S. Customs agents.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is just one case among many,'' said Ira Glasser,
executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley filed a lawsuit in federal court in Newark, citing a
General Accounting Office report suggesting that Customs agents
should do a better job choosing which airline passengers to search.
</P>
<P>
   The report, from March, said black female citizens in 1998 were
nine times more likely than white female citizens to be X-rayed
after being frisked or patted down. The searches occurred even
though the black women were less than half as likely to be found
carrying contraband as the white women, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Janet Rapaport, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Customs Service, said
she ''cannot comment on today's case because it's pending
litigation.''
</P>
<P>
   She did note, however, that Customs had tightened procedures
involving airport searches considerably in the last year,
increasing supervision and making other changes.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement issued at the news conference, Lee said Bradley
had worked with him as an associate creative director for two
years.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was outraged and saddened when she told me of her experience
at Newark Airport, not only on her behalf but on behalf of all
African-American women who have come to expect and fear this
humiliating treatment,'' Lee said.
</P>
<P>
   ''As an employer, I am deeply disturbed that Yvette and other
women of color who work for me must wonder, every time they get on
an airplane, whether they will be detained and mistreated,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said that when she returned from Jamaica she noticed as
she waited in line at a Customs checkpoint that a
disproportionately high number of black women had their luggage
searched.
</P>
<P>
   She said she mentioned the disparity to the Customs agent in
charge of her line, but he ignored her and proceeded to search her
suitcase, purse and backpack.
</P>
<P>
   Then, responding to the agent's questions, Bradley told him she
was an advertising professional with a prestigious agency and that
she lived in a Fifth Avenue penthouse. He then sent her to a room
with female inspectors, Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think I was a little too uppity for him,'' she said. ''I
think he sent me over to degrade and humiliate me.''
</P>
<P>
   In a separate room, a female Customs agent rubbed her hands over
the surface of Bradley's entire body, including her breasts and
between her legs, according to the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had to suffer through it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said she was later told she was selected for a search
because a $300 hat she was wearing raised suspicions.

<HEADLINE> Brewers 6, Pirates 1  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Some pitchers exceed their team's
expectations, while others fall short.
</P>
<P>
   The contrast was on display Friday night when Jimmy Haynes, the
overachiever, got the best of Jason Schmidt, the pitcher whose
record and talent don't match.
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt gave up Henry Blanco's first career grand slam, and the
Milwaukee Brewers went on to beat the Pittsburgh Pirates 6-1.
</P>
<P>
   Haynes improved to 5-2 with his third win in four starts.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's been a pleasant surprise,'' Milwaukee manager Davey Lopes
said of Haynes, who came from Oakland as part of a nine-player,
four-team deal last winter.
</P>
<P>
   Haynes, with his third organization, might have found a home
with the Brewers.
</P>
<P>
   ''I said I was going to come out with the attitude that I would
show them what I could do and go after guys,'' Haynes said. ''I've
made my pitches, kept the ball down, and it's worked out so far.''
</P>
<P>
   Blanco's homer came in the second inning.
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt, Pittsburgh's No. 1 starter, is 1-3 with a 4.76 earned
run average. Instead of being the consistent winner the Pirates
thought he'd be, Schmidt is still trying to find himself as a
pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   ''He didn't have real good control,'' Pirates manager Gene
Lamont said. ''It wasn't one of his better games. He was wild out
of the strike zone and he didn't have good command within the
strike zone. Whenever he did throw strikes, they were right down
the middle.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what happened on Blanco's home run.
</P>
<P>
   ''Maybe he thought I was going to take a pitch,'' Blanco said.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, that was about all Schmidt had to offer. He couldn't
control his slider or changeup, which is why he walked two batters
in the inning.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's real tough to pitch with only one pitch in the big
leagues,'' Schmidt said. ''I don't know what it is, but I haven't
had good control of the other pitches all year.''
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh's only run came on Brian Giles' ninth homer.
</P>
<P>
   Blanco, who caught the longest nine-inning game in NL history on
Wednesday, was right back in the lineup after the Brewers' 14-8 win
over the Cubs in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Lopes checked with Blanco to see if he could play Friday. He got
the answer he expected.
</P>
<P>
   ''He wants to work,'' Lopes said. ''He's my No. 1 guy and he's
going to be in there. He's not going to catch every game,
obviously, but I'll pick my spots for him to sit.''
</P>
<P>
   Blanco said he was fine, but did admit he slept well after the
Brewers arrived at their Pittsburgh hotel.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was out as soon as I hit the bed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Brewers have won seven consecutive games in Pittsburgh. They
swept all six last year and are 10-2 all-time in Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   The Pirates are 1-3 on the current homestand after going 5-1 on
a trip through St. Louis and Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee has won consecutive games for the first time since
April 5-6, when the Brewers won the first two games of the season
against Cincinnati.

<HEADLINE> Reds 7, Astros 3  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL A. LUTZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- Earning the win meant much less to pitcher Danny
Graves than his first career hit.
</P>
<P>
   Graves' solo homer in the 11th inning followed Pokey Reese's
three-run shot as the Cincinnati Reds rallied to a 7-3 win over the
Houston Astros on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's a once-in-a-lifetime thing,'' Graves said. ''It's way
more exciting than my first win or my first save. I don't even hit
home runs in batting practice. I won't sleep tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Graves, who was 0-for-11 in his career, hit the first pitch
after Reese broke a 3-3 tie over the left-field fence. Graves (5-0)
pitched three innings for the win.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody in the dugout went crazy,'' Reds manager Jack McKeon
said after witnessing Graves' hit. ''That was a shocker but it
couldn't happen to a nicer guy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Reds won their fifth straight game and for the fifth time
this season in their last at-bat.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Boone and Alex Ochoa walked off Mike Maddux (2-2) to start
the 11th inning. Gookie Dawkins sacrificed the runners before Reese
hit his first homer of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ''The thing that was so good about this was is that it helped us
get a win,'' Reese said. ''I just wanted to get the ball out of the
infield and hit it deep enough to get a run home. I got a fastball
up and I just put the bat on the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Graves didn't know how to react to his first hit.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I started running, I saw that (Bill) Spiers just watched
it go over,'' Graves said. ''I didn't know what to do. I didn't
know if I was supposed to slap hands with the coaches or what, or
how fast I was supposed to run.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros took a 3-2 lead into the ninth inning with closer
Billy Wagner on the mound. Boone, who hit a game-winning, two-run
homer in the ninth inning of Cincinnati's 11-9 win over San Diego
on Thursday, doubled to left field to start the inning. Ochoa
followed with a double off the left-field scoreboard to tie the
game.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a tough one to lose,'' Astros manager Larry Dierker
said. ''It's in our division and had lead in the ninth. With Billy
on the mound, that's usually one in the bank but Billy can't do it
every time.''
</P>
<P>
   Ochoa's clutch hit kept Reds starter Denny Neagle from being the
loser and kept alive Neagle's streak of 10 straight winning
decisions. Neagle won his final six decisions last season and
remained 4-0 this season.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Cedeno, who had a career-high five hits, singled with one
out, stole second and went to third on a groundout in the ninth.
After Jeff Bagwell walked, Ken Caminiti grounded out to end the
threat and force extra innings.
</P>
<P>
   ''I found it tonight, I hope I can keep it going,'' Cedeno said.
''I've just got to be patient and let things happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Cedeno had a two-run single in the second inning and scored
Houston's third run in the fifth on a sacrifice fly by Craig
Biggio.
</P>
<P>
   Dmitri Young's RBI single in the third inning gave Cincinnati
its first run and extended Young's career-high hitting streak to 17
games. Boone hit a solo homer in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Octavio Dotel allowed two runs and four hits in six innings for
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Griffey Jr., making his first appearance in Enron Field,
went 0-for-5.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Reds relievers have allowed three earned runs in their last
20 innings and have converted their last eight save opportunities.
... Neagle's last loss was Aug. 25 last season at Atlanta. ...
Young's hitting streak is the longest of the season for Cincinnati.
... Bagwell has homered at least once in eight of the Astros last
nine series. ...Cedeno's second inning stolen base was the 100th of
his career.

<HEADLINE> Dodgers 13, Cardinals 0  </HEADLINE>
By R.B. FALLSTROM
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Two Los Angeles Dodgers slumps are now history.
</P>
<P>
   Darren Dreifort threw a two-hitter and Shawn Green had four RBIs
in a 13-0 victory over the St. Louis Cardinals Friday night as the
Dodgers ended a four-game losing streak and a seven-game skid on
the road.
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort (3-1) struck out six and walked three in his third
career complete game, all of them shutouts. He succeeded by keeping
the ball down, allowing only three fly-ball outs.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was our best-pitched game of the year,'' manager Davey
Johnson said. ''It looked like he was kind of forcing it early, but
he settled in and made it look easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Catcher Todd Hundley helped by ending a 1-for-19 slump against
basestealers, throwing out Fernando Vina after Vina drew a leadoff
walk in the first. Hundley also homered for the fifth time in six
starts with a two-run shot that capped a five-run first, but
appeared more excited about his arm.
</P>
<P>
   ''How about that? How about that?'' he joked, pointing at
reporters. ''I just got rid of it and used the turf. I've got to
give our shortstop credit for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Green, who had a three-run double in the first and an RBI double
in the second, is 9-for-20 the last five games.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers jumped on Darry Kile (6-2), who has had six good
outings and two horrendous ones. He gave up eight earned runs in 1
2-3 innings at Colorado on April 13. Against the Dodgers, Kile
lasted 5 2-3 innings and allowed eight runs on seven hits as his
ERA soared to 5.51.
</P>
<P>
   ''I went out there and pretty much had my lunch handed to me,''
Kile said.
</P>
<P>
   In his other six outings, Kile has a 3.51 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Dodgers swung the bats like they knew what was coming,''
pitching coach Dave Duncan said. ''Even if you get balls in the
middle of the plate, the timing is going to be off some of the
time. It wasn't tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Kile didn't think he was tipping his pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of times you throw pitches over the heart of the plate
and they're going to be right on them, no matter what it is,'' Kile
said. ''That's why they're at this level.''
</P>
<P>
   Kile wasn't helped in the first when left fielder Ray Lankford,
suffering from blurred vision, was tentative going after two
catchable fly balls that dropped for hits. One of them was Green's
three-run double to left center.
</P>
<P>
   Lankford was replaced in the bottom of the first by Eric Davis,
whose two-out double was the Cardinals' only hit through the first
five innings. Manager Tony La Russa said Lankford's eyes were
dilated from a vision test on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals, the NL Central leaders, lost for the seventh time
in 10 games in May.
</P>
<P>
   Reliever Darren Holmes also had a tough night, allowing an RBI
single to Todd Hollandsworth in the sixth and a two-run double by
Mark Grudzielanek in a three-run eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Cora's two-run single in the ninth, his third hit, made it
13-0.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Dreifort's last shutout came against Florida on Aug. 18,
1999. ... Illinois football coach Ron Turner threw out the first
pitch and it was a wild one, sailing far above the head of the
Cardinals' Larry Sutton. ... Before Friday, the Cardinals had
outscored their opponents 48-18 in the first inning. ... The
Dodgers started the season 9-3 on the road. ... Hundley has homered
in five of his last six starts. ... The Cardinals have dropped two
of three each of the last three series. ... The Dodgers were
outscored 42-23 during their four-game losing streak.

<HEADLINE> Civil rights commission stands by NYPD report  </HEADLINE>
By SHANNON McCAFFREY
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal civil rights panel stood by its
recommendation that a special prosecutor should handle severe cases
of police misconduct in New York City despite opposition from
Manhattan's chief prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal is contained in a draft report the U.S. Commission
on Civil Rights prepared on the New York Police Department in the
wake of the police torture of Abner Louima and the shooting of
Amadou Diallo.
</P>
<P>
   While the report praised the department for working to improve
its relationship with minorities, it's findings were largely
unflattering. It criticized the department on everything from
training to promotions and said it appeared ''racial profiling''
was being used by city cops in deciding who to stop and frisk.
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting Friday, the commissioners suggested they may make
further specific recommendations on how the city should combat
racial profiling.
</P>
<P>
   The report they are refining also recommends requiring officers
to live in the city and that they be encouraged to obtain a
four-year college degree. Evidence shows that better-educated
officers were less likely to engage in misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   Commission Chairwoman Mary Frances Berry said she supports the
idea of a special prosecutor because it removes even the appearance
of a conflict in cases where a district attorney would usually
investigate and prosecute police officers with whom they typically
work closely. The report suggests intervention by a special
prosecutor only in serious felony-level cases.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would think the DAs would like this also,'' Berry said.
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't appear to be the case.
</P>
<P>
   Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau wrote a letter to
the commission saying special prosecutors were not needed because
his office already vigorously pursues cases of police misconduct,
Berry said. In the letter, Morgenthau also complained that his
office had not been contacted about the commission's
recommendation. U.S. Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., has
called the need for special prosecutors ''nonsense.''
</P>
<P>
   Morgenthau's office had no comment Friday on the report or the
letter.
</P>
<P>
   Much of Friday's four-hour commission meeting in Washington was
spent hammering out minor details in the draft report which has yet
to be released publicly. The committee is awaiting rebuttals to its
findings from New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, Police
Commissioner Howard Safir and the Civilian Complaint Review Board.
</P>
<P>
   The report -- critical of the Giuliani administration -- comes as
the mayor runs against Hillary Rodham Clinton for the U.S. Senate
seat from New York. At least one of the commissioners said the
timing of its release was politically motivated.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that's quite self evident,'' said Commissioner Russell
Redenbaugh. ''Now we're putting out a report in the political
season.''
</P>
<P>
   The civil rights panel consists of four Democrats, three
independents (including Redenbaugh) and one Republican. Giuliani
has called the panel a ''political operation of the Democratic
Party,'' out to aid the first lady's Senate bid.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in a sign of how politically touchy the report is, the
commission spent a good portion of its meeting Friday discussing
how to ensure the final version includes input from the Giuliani
administration.
</P>
<P>
   ''Given the controversy ... we need to make sure we cross our
T's and dot our I's on this,'' Commissioner Christopher Edley said.
</P>
<P>
   The commission, which was created by the Civil Rights Act of
1957, has no enforcement powers but makes recommendations to
Congress and the president. The panel held a hearing on the NYPD in
New York City last May and subpoenaed thousands of pages of
documents and police complaint records.

<HEADLINE> Diamondbacks 6, Padres 4  </HEADLINE>
By BERNIE WILSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- The Arizona Diamondbacks are doing just fine
without their All-Star third baseman and their closer.
</P>
<P>
   So well that they've won a franchise-record eight straight, the
latest a 6-4 victory over the San Diego Padres on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks have been missing third baseman Matt Williams
all year with a broken right foot, and have seen closer Matt Mantei
go back on the disabled list with a sore right shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've got a lot of other good players,'' said left-hander
Brian Anderson, who along with fellow Padres-killer Steve Finley
led the Diamondbacks Friday night. ''It just seems like every night
that someone else is stepping up, having a big night, and when you
don't have to rely on just two or three guys, that just makes you a
very dangerous team,'' Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everything right now is clicking and going well, and that
excites us to know that we're able to do what we've done so far.''
</P>
<P>
   The streak has given the Diamondbacks a 25-10 record, the best
in baseball. Arizona beat San Diego for the fifth straight time,
including four during the streak. Arizona outscored the Padres 23-9
in sweeping a series last weekend in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres, coming off just the third 0-6 road trip in their
32-year history, lost their seventh straight and 13th in 16 games.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson (3-0) continued two streaks by holding the Padres to
one run and six hits in seven innings. He won his ninth straight
decision dating to July 24, and his last four wins have all come
against the Padres, dating to the last day of the 1999 season.
</P>
<P>
   Finley, an ex-Padre, has four homers and 11 RBIs in eight games
against San Diego this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've faced these guys so much already early in the season
that it's kind of blown out of proportion,'' Finley said.
</P>
<P>
   Finley hit his 13th homer to right-center field off Matt Clement
(4-2) with two outs in the fourth, giving the Diamondbacks a 2-0
lead. The homer came after first baseman Ed Sprague booted Erubiel
Durazo's routine grounder for his second error of the game, making
both runs unearned.
</P>
<P>
   Finley is 25-for-80 (.313) with six homers and 17 homers against
the Padres since he signed with Arizona as part of San Diego's
post-World Series exodus in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've definitely given Finley good balls to hit since we've
been facing him,'' Padres manager Bruce Bochy said.
</P>
<P>
   Finley homered on a fastball that came back over the plate.
</P>
<P>
   ''That home run right there is magnified about 10 times more
than it would be at any other time of the season,'' Clement said.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Hernandez's bases-loaded infield single pulled the Padres
to 2-1 in the fifth, but the Diamondbacks pulled away on Durazo's
RBI single with two outs in the sixth and Tony Womack's two-run
single in the seventh. Damian Miller hit an RBI double in the
ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Sprague hit a three-run homer off Greg Swindell in the ninth to
make it 6-4. Sprague has seven homers this season -- six against
Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Byung-Hyun Kim got two outs for his third save.
</P>
<P>
   Clement lost his second straight start after having won eight
straight decisions dating to Sept. 5. He allowed three hits and
three runs, one earned, in six innings.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Padres made six roster moves, including purchasing the
contract of RHP Stan Spencer from Triple-A Las Vegas. Spencer is
scheduled to start tonight against Todd Stottlemyre. The Padres
also recalled Brandon Kolb and purchased the contract of Matt
Whiteside. Starter Rodrigo Lopez was optioned and reliever Vicente
Palacios was outrighted, both to Vegas. Reliever Rodney Myers was
placed on the 60-day DL and will undergo surgery Saturday to repair
the patellar tendon in his left knee. ... Kolb started the ninth,
making his major league debut. ... Mantei, on the DL with a sore
right shoulder, threw a simulated game of 25 pitches, facing six
batters, and reported no ill effects. He's scheduled to throw
another simulated game on Sunday. He's eligible to be activated on
May 20.

<HEADLINE> Lakers 105, Suns 99  </HEADLINE>
By BOB BAUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- Take Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant, then throw
in 51 free throws, and the Los Angeles Lakers are just about
impossible to beat.
</P>
<P>
   That's how the bewildered Phoenix Suns felt after they came
close again but lost to the Lakers 105-99 Friday night. Los Angeles
is one victory away from a four-game sweep in the Western
Conference semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   Penny Hardaway, who scored 31 in the loss, wouldn't say the
officials favored the Lakers, but he was frustrated.
</P>
<P>
   ''That team is already really good,'' he said. ''It seemed like
every time we'd go down and work hard at the offensive end, they'd
go to the foul line. They're a great team, but it's kind of
demoralizing when you foul every time down. That's unbelievable,
man.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal scored 11 of his 37 points in the fourth quarter and
grabbed 17 rebounds as the Lakers won their first road game of the
playoffs to take a 3-0 lead in the best-of-seven series.
</P>
<P>
   ''Shaq hit some incredible shots,'' Phoenix coach Scott Skiles
said.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles, which won Game 2 Thursday 97-96 on Bryant's tough
15-footer with 2.6 seconds to go, can complete its first playoff
sweep since 1991 and first sweep of a seven-game series since 1989
with a victory on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our goal was to just come in here and win one,'' O'Neal said.
''We got the first one. Now our goal will be to close it out on
Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   Hardaway, averaging 26 points in the first two games of the
series, made 11 of 15 shots, but missed a 3-pointer with 46 seconds
to go and the Suns down 100-97. Cliff Robinson scored 23, but only
two after leaving to have his sprained right ankle taped late in
the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Kidd had 12 assists, but was only 1-for-9 from the field
for four points.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers, who lost both games in Sacramento in the first round
of the playoffs, outscored the Suns 11-4 over the last 2:33,
including 9-for-12 on free throws. Bryant scored 25 on 8-for-20
shooting and Robert Horry had 15 off the bench.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal's stuff, the Lakers' last field goal, put Los Angeles up
for good 96-95 with 2:33 to go. Bryant's two free throws with 1:34
remaining made it 98-95, but Hardaway made two free throws with
1:15 remaining to cut it to 98-97.
</P>
<P>
   On the Lakers' next possession, Rice broke free to the basket
and took a pass from Brian Shaw. Rice was fouled by Luc Longley and
sank both free throws. After Hardaway missed the 3-pointer, Shaw
sank two free throws to make it 102-97 with 26.4 seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ''We just had a little extra down there in the fourth quarter to
come back and win the ball game,'' Lakers coach Phil Jackson said.
''We shot the ball relatively well from the 3-point line and, of
course, free throws were the story to win this ball game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers were 35-for-51 from the line, 14-for-23 in the fourth
quarter. The Suns were 25-for-34.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal was 9-for-15 from the foul line, 8-for-11 in the first
half, when Skiles put Oliver Miller in for the sole purpose of
sending Shaq to the line.
</P>
<P>
   ''For me, it's a concentration thing,'' O'Neal said. ''I tried
to concentrate a little bit harder today and I hit them when I
needed to hit them. I'll probably never shoot 78 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodney Rogers, winner of the NBA's Sixth Man Award who struggled
in the first two games of the series, scored 15, but still had
trouble from long range and was only 5-for-12 from the field.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-7 Rogers even guarded O'Neal for a stretch in the
second half and held his own. But that matchup helped lead to
Rogers' fouling out in the game's final minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've had two games that could have gone either way,'' Kidd
said, ''and we find ourselves behind the 8-ball. We've just got to
find our shovels and dig ourselves out of this ditch.''
</P>
<P>
   Down 52-50 at the half, the Suns used an 11-0 run to go up 61-54
on Robinson's 3-pointer with 8:09 left in the period.
</P>
<P>
   Luc Longley, who scored eight of his 12 points in the third
quarter, sandwiched a tip-in between two 18-footers as the Suns
built a 67-59 lead with 5:51 to go. But Longley drew his fourth
foul 14 seconds later and went to the bench.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal had a stuff and Kobe Bryant sank a 17-footer in a 7-0
Lakers spurt that tied it at 72 with 2:18 to go in the third, and
the Suns held a 76-75 lead going into the final quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The teams battled back and forth through most of the fourth,
with the Suns taking their last lead 95-94 on Shawn Marion's
14-foot baseline jumper with 2:48 to play.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had a meltdown towards the end and we did some
uncharacteristic things tht hurt us a little bit,'' Skiles said.
''We just lost our composure. It's a learning process right now.''
</P>
<P>
   The Suns shot out to a 19-7 lead with the big crowd behind them,
but the Lakers scored 34 points in the second quarter, including
two 3-pointers apiece by Horry and Rick Fox, to lead 52-50 at the
half.
</P>
<P>
@Notes: The Lakers missed 10 consecutive shots in the first
quarter. ... Referee Jim Clark whistled Skiles for a technical with
2:22 left in the first quarter. ... Phoenix shot 63 percent in the
first quarter and 37 percent in the second. ... Robinson had a
rough game, leaving with an injured left index finger with 4:47
left in the first half, then returning only to sprain his ankle in
the third quarter. ... The Suns' Kevin Johnson played just six
minutes, none in the second half.

<HEADLINE> N.M. Fire Sends Smoke for Miles  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY MASSEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) -- A fire that devoured forests and homes in
Los Alamos has left a haze over much of northern New Mexico,
causing watery eyes and scratchy throats for those living beneath
the smoke plume.
</P>
<P>
   ''Forest fire smoke contains a lot of really nasty compounds,''
said C. Mack Sewell, state epidemiologist in the state Health
Department. Among those are carbon monoxide.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities say the health problems locally should leave with
the smoke, and government officials maintained there was no danger
for people in other states.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, though the fire invaded Los Alamos National
Laboratory, property that covers 43 square miles and 50 technical
sites, officials there said no radioactivity had been carried aloft
with smoke. A lab spokesman said air monitoring has detected no
elevated levels of radioactivity.
</P>
<P>
   For days, the smoke has hung over portions of northern New
Mexico. The fire had burned more than 33,000 acres by Friday.
</P>
<P>
   A shift in wind direction Friday pushed smoke into Santa Fe, 35
miles southeast of Los Alamos. A haze partly obscured the Sangre de
Cristo Mountains northeast of the city and an acrid odor lingered
in the air. Health officials said the smoke was responsible for
watery eyes, scratchy throats and runny noses.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can't go outside. It hurts your throat. We left town the
last couple of nights because it was so bad,'' said Terry Mulert,
36, who lives in tiny Cordova, north of Santa Fe, with his wife and
2-year-old son.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities advised people to remain indoors with windows shut
if they have respiratory problems such as asthma or feel eye and
throat irritation.
</P>
<P>
   Because of questions about pollution and health hazards from the
fire, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and state
Environment Department were installing independent air monitoring
equipment to measure potential contaminants from the smoke.
</P>
<P>
   The lab, which is part of the federal nuclear weapons complex,
permanently operates an air monitoring network on its property and
nearby areas. But once the fire began, the lab temporarily placed
air sampling devices in outlying towns -- some up to 40 miles away --
to test the smoke plume.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are a lot of rumors floating around. This is to give
that extra comfort level to the public to rest assured their health
is not being impacted by radioactivity,'' said Doug Stavert, the
lab's air quality group leader.
</P>
<P>
   The lab has maintained that its main supplies of radioactive
materials and high explosives are safely protected from the fire in
reinforced buildings or concrete bunkers.
</P>
<P>
   But there are questions about what's happened to buried dumps on
lab property -- some dating to early atomic bomb work in the 1940s --
that contain millions of cubic feet of wastes contaminated with
plutonium, uranium and tritium.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the continuing fire threat, the lab hasn't been able
to survey the waste sites to determine which ones were burnt,
Stavert said.

<HEADLINE> Six Rockets Explode in Baghdad  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- At least six missiles exploded in the Iraqi
capital of Baghdad before dawn on Saturday, killing an infant girl
and wounding an undisclosed number of people, an Arab satellite
television channel reported.
</P>
<P>
   The attack is the second bombardment of Baghdad this month and
the third this year.
</P>
<P>
   No group immediately claimed responsibility, but Qatar's
Al-Jazeera channel reported that Iran was suspected of being behind
the attack. The Iraqi government blamed the attacks of earlier this
month and in March on Iranian agents.
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate word either from the Iraqi government or
from Iran about the attack.
</P>
<P>
   The rockets demolished three houses in al-Karkh, a district on
the west bank of the Tigris River. Al-Jazeera showed the interior
of one of the destroyed homes and an ambulance at the scene.
</P>
<P>
   On May 1, rockets exploded in the Baladiyat district of Baghdad,
wounding eight people, at about the same time as a mortar attack on
police headquarters in Tehran, Iran. The Iraqi-based rebel group,
Mujahedeen Khalq, claimed responsibility for the Tehran attack that
wounded six people.
</P>
<P>
   On March 22, a mortar attack on Baladiyat killed four people and
injured 38.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq and Iran fought an eight-year war that ended with a
U.N.-brokered cease-fire in 1988. The two Muslim neighbors never
signed a peace treaty and their relations since the end of the war
have remained tense. Each harbors dissident groups fighting the
other's government.

Philippine Rebels May Release Ill Hostages
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   JOLO, Philippines (AP) -- Muslim rebels holding 21 hostages in the
Philippine jungle said today that they would consider releasing two ailing
captives. In addition, negotiators said they had reached an "understanding" with
the Abu Sayyaf rebels that a sick German woman and perhaps even a French man
would be freed later in the day. The Abu Sayyaf rebels' willingness to consider
the release appeared to be a positive shift from a day earlier, when the
guerrillas had decided against freeing them. Abdul Rajab Azzarouq, a former
Libyan ambassador to the Philippines who is helping negotiate, left Jolo city
Saturday to meet with the rebels to follow up on the possible release, the
negotiator said.

Los Alamos Fire Is Still Raging
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   LOS ALAMOS, N.M. (AP) -- The blowtorch winds and searing heat that fed a
raging wildfire broke Friday, easing the threat to Los Alamos from a blaze that
destroyed 260 homes, damaged the town's nuclear weapons laboratory and forced
25,000 people to flee. The fire remained out of control in the nearby forests
and canyons, however, and residents were told they could not return to their
houses for at least a week. As the night wore on firefighters started to gain
some ground. Fire information officer Martin Chavez said the blaze was about 5

More Peacekeepers in Sierra Leone

<P>
	   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) -- Fresh troops arrived in Sierra Leone's
capital as the president paid homage to 19 people killed during a recent
demonstration against rebel troops who resumed fighting. A few hundred more
Jordanian soldiers arrived Friday to help shore up the beleaguered U.N.
peacekeeping force in Freetown, where as many as 30,000 refugees gathered to
escape attacks by an advancing guerrilla army. Despite calls from African
countries to let United Nations peacekeepers use more force against the rebels,
there was little indication Friday that the U.N. Security Council wanted to play
a more active combat role in the conflict.

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Hoping to contain Africa's newest war, the Security
Council demanded that Eritrea and Ethiopia immediately stop fighting and hinted
at a possible arms embargo if the conflict doesn't die down over the weekend. In
a resolution unanimously adopted Friday just hours after fighting along the
Eritrean-Ethiopian border flared, the council demanded the Horn of Africa
neighbors restart stalled peace talks that broke down last week. The resolution
said the council would meet again on Monday "to take immediate steps to ensure
compliance with this resolution" if fighting continues.

Christian Site Advertising on CBS

	   DETROIT (AP) -- A Christian online business denied the ability to air
national advertisements on CBS during the upcoming "Jesus" miniseries will
instead have the ads run on 16 network affiliates. IBelieve.com was eager to
advertise on the high-profile program, but CBS rejected the ads on the grounds
that their content is too similar to the program and might confuse viewers. The
two-part series begins Sunday night. CBS spokesman Dana McClintock said earlier
this week that the TV ads were rejected because they would "commercialize" the
show and were not "consistent with the expectations of a diverse audience."

<HEADLINE> Film Spotlights Algeria, France  </HEADLINE>
By MARILYN AUGUST
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- The scenes are separated by more than three
decades: the first French refugees departing aboard ship in 1962 as
Algeria lurches violently toward independence from France, the
second in 1994 as Muslim women march for peace to end nightly
massacres amid a bitter Islamic insurgency.
</P>
<P>
   The powerful images evoking the torment of modern Algeria are
brought to the screen in a new movie by French director Alexandre
Arcady, 51, a pied-noir, or French colonial, who fled with his
family in 1961.
</P>
<P>
   A box-office hit since it opened in France last month, ''La-bas,
Mon Pays,'' or ''Over There, My Homeland'' is the first foreign
film to be shot on location in Algeria in 16 years. It has earned
high marks from the press in Algeria following its world premier
there.
</P>
<P>
   ''The film crews stopped traffic. We prepared sets. This wasn't
like making a documentary or filming for the nightly news,'' said
Arcady, who received permission to film from President Abdelaziz
Bouteflika.
</P>
<P>
   Loosely adapted from a novel by Rene Bonnell, ''La-bas, Mon
Pays'' is the tale of a high-profile television anchorman called
back to his native Algeria to rescue the daughter of his first
love, Leila, who is the daughter of an Arab postal worker who lived
in the same building.
</P>
<P>
   Part thriller, part love story, the film shifts from past to
present: the good life enjoyed by French colonials colliding with
the violence and oppression of today.
</P>
<P>
   Colonial Algeria and the 1.2 million pieds-noir -- including
120,000 Jews like Arcady, who fled during the 1962 war of
independence -- have fueled the director's imagination since he
began filmmaking.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was incredible to be behind the camera in the streets where
I played as a kid, in the house where I was born, in the cemetery
where my grandmother is buried,'' Arcady said. ''But the Algeria of
my childhood no longer exists.''
</P>
<P>
   Arcady says the film's very existence sends a signal Algeria may
be ready to renew artistic ties with the West. Before independence,
Algiers once boasted 400 movie theaters, mostly French-owned.
Today, there are only 10 cinemas in the whole country, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it's a sign of a new openness and a desire for
change,'' he said at a post-screening debate in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Algeria has been isolated since 1992 when violence erupted after
the army canceled elections that a Muslim fundamentalist party was
poised to win. Since then, resulting violence has killed at least
100,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   Last November, Bouteflika, who was elected on a peace platform
six months earlier, invited popular pied-noir singer Enrico Macias,
whose songs evoke passion and longing for Algeria, to perform in
his native Constantine.
</P>
<P>
   In exile since the massacre of family members during the
independence war, the Jewish Macias accepted. The tour was canceled
after Algerian officials bowed to pressure from 18 Muslim clerics
who protested the visit as an attempt to establish diplomatic ties
with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ''Before independence, Christians, Jews and Arabs lived in the
same building, with their front doors always open, sharing each
other's joys and sorrows,'' Arcady said.
</P>
<P>
   That harmony ended when violence broke out and segregation
became the norm.
</P>
<P>
   ''A European walking in an Arab neighborhood or vice versa was
risking his life,'' said Lazare Bouaziz, 66, a retired dentist,
whose entire family fled the port Oran on the eve of the infamous
July 1962 massacres.
</P>
<P>
   Sylvie Moryoussef, 42, remembers being bundled into blankets and
sped to the airport in a hail of bullets in the middle of the
night. She was 4 years old.
</P>
<P>
   ''My parents lost everything, but basically, they felt lucky to
get out alive,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The film has been popular among pieds-noir who lived through the
period.
</P>
<P>
   ''Arcady could have made a sugarcoated version of our
experience,'' Bouaziz said. ''But instead, he showed the violence
of our exodus -- raw and unembellished.''

<HEADLINE> Hearst CEO Defends Editorial Offer  </HEADLINE>
By SCOTT ANDREWS
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The San Francisco Examiner's publisher
would have been disciplined sooner if Hearst Corp. had known of an
offer to give Mayor Willie Brown favorable editorials in exchange
for his support of Hearst's purchase of the rival Chronicle, a top
executive testified.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst officials testified in court Friday that they had no idea
of the offer from now-suspended Publisher Timothy White until he
acknowledged it in court May 1.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was horrified,'' Hearst Corp. CEO Frank Bennack Jr. said.
''If true, it is clearly outside and contrary to our policies ...
and Journalism 101.''
</P>
<P>
   Bennack said he would have disciplined White earlier if he had
known about the publisher's similar testimony in a deposition in
December.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst is being sued by Clint Reilly, a real estate investor and
former mayoral candidate, on antitrust grounds to block its
purchase of the Chronicle and the subsidized transfer of the
Examiner to a company set up by publisher Ted Fang.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the deal have said Hearst executives knew last year
about the offer. They also were accused of taking action against
White only because he disclosed it publicly.
</P>
<P>
   Bennack and Hearst Newspapers President George Irish said they
were unaware of the offer prior to White's testimony. Brown has
said he can't recall whether such an offer was made.
</P>
<P>
   Irish said he did not believe White had correctly answered the
question in court about his offer to the mayor.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've known Tim White for nine years and I've known him to be a
very honorable person and I just think he was confused,'' Irish
testified.
</P>
<P>
   The Chronicle and Examiner are jointly run, except for editorial
functions, under a federal antitrust exemption. The owners of both
papers want to terminate the joint operating agreement five years
early.
</P>
<P>
   On the trial's first day, White testified that he made the offer
to Brown. He later recanted in a written statement to the media,
saying the editorial independence of the paper was never in
jeopardy. No attempt has been made in court to retract or
contradict his testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Bennack also testified about his negotiations for the Chronicle,
saying Hearst's first offer of $565 million was met with the
Chronicle Publishing Co.'s counteroffer of $700 million. The
companies eventually settled on $660 million.
</P>
<P>
   Bennack said he plans to improve the Chronicle editorially,
using increased profits he anticipates from shedding the Examiner,
which has about one-quarter the readers of the Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we have the opportunity to give this region the kind
of world-class newspaper it is entitled to,'' he testified. ''That
is what we intend to do.''

<HEADLINE> Giuliani Weighing Senate Options  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Closeted with top advisers, Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani is questioning whether he can salvage a Senate bid against
Hillary Rodham Clinton and weighing his health and marital
problems.
</P>
<P>
   As the conversations proceeded Friday, Giuliani sounded
increasingly discouraged about the prospects for his campaign,
according to a person very knowledgeable about the mayor's
discussions.
</P>
<P>
   The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
mayor's pessimism was reflected in ''the type of questions that
he's asking and the kinds of comments he's making after we give him
answers.''
</P>
<P>
   Cautioning that the situation was extremely fluid, the source
said the mayor was going back and forth in his thinking about
whether to stay in the race.
</P>
<P>
   As of late Friday, the mayor had not told his advisers what he
would do. The source said the mayor's inner circle did not expect a
decision before Sunday or Monday at the earliest.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, 55, announced two weeks ago he had treatable prostate
cancer. The following week he told reporters he was spending time
with ''a very good friend,'' Judith Nathan. And this week, he
disclosed he was seeking a legal separation from his wife of 16
years, Donna Hanover. Hanover responded by dropping her own
bombshell, alleging that their marital woes began several years ago
over his relationship with a former press aide, Cristyne
Lategano-Nicholas.
</P>
<P>
   New polls indicate that voter dissatisfaction over the mayor's
marital problems and concern about his health could become factors
in his race with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   A New York Daily News/New York 1 poll out Friday found that 81
percent of New York voters said Giuliani's marital problems are a
private matter. Nonetheless, 11 percent said the issue was relevant
and made them see him more negatively as a candidate.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if the combination of factors -- his treatable
prostate cancer, the separation, his close friendship with Nathan
and his wife's claim that he had a previous relationship with a
former staff member -- meant he should get out of the race, 63
percent said he should continue to run. Seventeen percent said he
should pack up his campaign gear.
</P>
<P>
   Asked Friday if he found the results heartening, Giuliani said:
''No, this is a very highly personal matter. My focus and concern
are for all the people involved in it. I've never paid an awful lot
of attention to polls.''
</P>
<P>
   A New York Post/Fox TV poll from the end of April, conducted by
Zogby International just after Giuliani announced he had cancer,
found 12 percent of voters said the disease meant he was no longer
a strong candidate. Eighty-two percent said he remained a strong
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Several Republicans have indicated they might be willing to step
into the race if Giuliani bows out. They include Reps. Rick Lazio
and Peter King, both of Long Island; Wall Street financier Theodore
Forstmann; and state Assembly Minority Leader John Faso, among
others.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, still working through his health and marital
problems, the mayor promised a decision as soon as possible. The
state party must nominate a candidate for the Senate race at its
convention May 30.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani made it clear that his health was his top priority when
he talked about possibly canceling a few political events next
week, including several fund-raisers.
</P>
<P>
   ''If some things are canceled, that's the reason they're being
canceled,'' he said. ''There are things I couldn't do this week
that I'm going to have to do next week.''
</P>
<P>
   A fund-raising trip slated for several cities in California next
Tuesday and Wednesday was still tentative, but could easily be
rescheduled, said campaign spokeswoman Juleanna Glover Weiss.
</P>
<P>
   ''We still very much believe that he is running,'' she added.

<HEADLINE> Alleged Killer on God's 'Mission'  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL GRACZYK
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- A prosecutor in the trial of the Texas Railroad
Killer questioned the credibility of a psychiatrist who contends
the serial killer cannot be held responsible for the slayings
because he is schizophrenic.
</P>
<P>
   During cross-examination Friday afternoon, Prosecutor Lyn
McLellan repeatedly accused Dr. Bruce Cohen of molding his opinion
to fit Angel Maturino Resendiz' insanity defense. Cohen, a forensic
psychiatrist, said he had found only 10 percent of the several
hundred defendants he has evaluated for sanity to be insane.
</P>
<P>
   McLellan asked Cohen how he could be certain Maturino Resendiz
was insane at the time of killings since Cohen did not interview
him until nine months later. Cohen responded that a disease like
paranoid schizophrenia develops over time, and that Maturino
Resendiz showed symptoms well before the killings.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can have symptoms of diabetes at one time or another, but
you still have diabetes,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   Maturino Resendiz, 40, has pleaded innocent by reason of
insanity in the 1998 rape, bludgeoning and stabbing of a
Houston-area physician, Dr. Claudia Benton. He has admitted to
eight other killings -- five in Texas, two in Illinois and one in
Kentucky -- over a two-year period starting in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Under Texas law, a person can only be found innocent by reason
of insanity if the defense can prove the person was suffering from
a mental disease and couldn't discern right from wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen, who interviewed the defendant and reviewed dozens of his
letters from jail, spent his second day on the stand as testimony
in the capital murder trial was winding up its first week. He was
to return to the stand for a third day Monday for further
cross-examination.
</P>
<P>
   Maturino Resendiz has no remorse and no awareness that he
committed any horrendous crimes because he believes he is on a
divine mission to eliminate evil, Cohen testified.
</P>
<P>
   ''That doesn't appear a recognition that he wants to stop and
can't,'' he said. ''He's saying, 'I can't stop even if I wanted to,
because God's force is on my side and God wants me to destroy evil
and that's why I can't stop.'''
</P>
<P>
   Friday's proceedings also included a surprise comment from the
defendant, who has previously spoken only through letters.
</P>
<P>
   As McLellan cross-examined Cohen, Maturino Resendiz spoke out to
get State District Judge Bill's Harmon's attention. Harmon excused
the jury and allowed Maturino Resendiz to speak.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was just wondering, those letters to the media they got hold
of are confidential. I don't know how they got them. They did open
all of my mail, but they are confidential,'' Maturino Resendiz said
.
</P>
<P>
   Harmon noted the remarks and called the jury back to the
courtroom.

<HEADLINE> Tornadoes Strike Midwest  </HEADLINE>
By MARTHA RAFFAELE
<TEXT>
<P>
   Residents in the Midwest were cleaning up after a storm packing
tornadoes, high winds and baseball-sized hail cut a swath from
Texas to Michigan, killing one person in Texas and injuring at
least two dozen others.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Friday, a 4-year-old Kansas girl died in the aftermath
of a tornado.
</P>
<P>
   As the line of storms churned eastward, severe thunderstorm and
tornado watches were posted early today from Texas to New York.
Forecasters said so far there have been over 18 tornado reports,
almost 150 reports of large hail, and over 44 wind damage reports.
</P>
<P>
   A 70-year-old man died when a twister touched down Friday
evening in Hill County, Texas, about 60 miles south of Dallas, said
Cpl. Charlie Morgan with the state Department of Public Safety. The
storm ripped roofs off houses and flipped mobile homes.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Small, who lives near Whitney, Texas, said he captured a
tornado on videotape.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just walked out the back of my house and saw a black cloud
coming back down to the ground,'' he said. ''I knew that was a
tornado forming, so I went back inside and got my video camera. I
saw it take several different shapes, and it appeared at one point
to be sucking water out of the lake.''
</P>
<P>
   In St. Nazianz, Wis., straight-line wind gusts up to 110 mph and
baseball-size hail heavily damaged a mobile home park Friday night,
where several people were injured, said Nancy Crowley, Manitowoc
County Emergency Government spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   ''It looks like you went along the sides of the buildings and
just busted them up with a baseball bat,'' Sheriff Tom Kocourek
said.
</P>
<P>
   About 28 people were injured as the storm hit east-central
Wisconsin. One person was in critical condition.
</P>
<P>
   ''All of a sudden it started raining and the hail came and then
it got bigger and it just blasted through the windows,'' said St.
Nazianz resident Don Orth, sweeping up shattered window glass at
his business.
</P>
<P>
   About 3,000 customers of Wisconsin Public Service Corp. of Green
Bay were left without electricity.
</P>
<P>
   Across Arkansas, trees were downed and electricity knocked out
in several counties, and some homes were damaged near Pine Bluff,
authorities said. The National Weather Service said it received a
report of a funnel cloud from a spotter at Magnet Cove.
</P>
<P>
   Storms also swept through Illinois with rain, high winds, hail
and at least two tornadoes in the southern part of the state.
Storms in the Chicago area contributed to flight delays and
cancellations at O'Hare and Midway airports. There were reports of
minor damage throughout the region.
</P>
<P>
   Thunderstorms pounded the northern half of Michigan's lower
peninsula, leaving behind a few downed trees. Several counties
reported hail, with the most extreme of baseball-sized hail
reported in Huron County.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Friday, a 4-year-old girl in Tonganoxie, Kan., died
after a porch roof collapsed onto her. The roof was believed to
have been damaged by a tornado that hit Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Bill Graves declared a disaster emergency Friday for the
area, which could lead to federal assistance, a spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   In Kansas City, Steve Okenfuss, managing partner of a Toyota
dealership, looked at piles of twisted metal and said the tornado
''demolished the building and everything inside it.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It looks like a big foot just smashed it,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Potassium Cyanide Barrels Found  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE WATSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- A trailer that had contained 20 barrels of
cyanide when it was stolen from a New Jersey warehouse was found
empty in an industrial park.
</P>
<P>
   The trailer was found late Friday without a cab or license
plates at an industrial park in Queens. It had been reported
missing May 4, after it was taken from the Union County warehouse
in Linden, N.J., where it contained a shipping container with 20
drums of potassium cyanide destined for Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   The orange drums are each marked with the number ''1680,'' an
industrywide number used to identify the chemical, said Detective
Joseph Pentangelo, a police spokesman. The combined value of the
cyanide, which was in powder form, is roughly $3,800, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Linden police had said earlier that the thieves were probably
unaware of their deadly cargo.
</P>
<P>
   New York City officials were first informed of the missing
trailer on Thursday, said Richard J. Sheirer, the director of the
city's Office of Emergency Management.
</P>
<P>
   The World Health Organization says potassium cyanide could be
used by terrorists, though Sheirer said, ''we don't believe it's
terrorists.''
</P>
<P>
   The FBI also is investigating.
</P>
<P>
   Potassium cyanide is used in electroplating, a process employed
to make silverware and jewelry, and can be fatal if inhaled or
swallowed.

<HEADLINE> Feds Deny Alien Education Bill  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Federal officials have declined to pick
up the tab for illegal aliens who attend classes in the Anaheim
Union High School District.
</P>
<P>
   A resolution passed by the district's Board of Trustees last
year asked the federal Immigration and Naturalization Service to
count the number of illegal immigrants who attend district schools
and determine where they came from.
</P>
<P>
   It also asked that the federal government reimburse the district
for the cost of educating them and then send the bill to their
native countries.
</P>
<P>
   School officials confirmed Thursday night that the Justice
Department sent them a letter in March saying it would not honor
the request.
</P>
<P>
   District officials said they would continue to look at ways of
getting their money back, however.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are not closing the door to any avenues that might open to
us, including legal, which includes filing a lawsuit,'' said Harald
Martin, the board's president.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, opponents of the effort have obtained documents
indicating the district spent $16,000 on attorney fees reviewing
the resolution and ways to enforce it.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are other, more pressing issues,'' said Green Party
member Duane J. Roberts, who requested the records.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution stirred opposition from dozens of district
residents and Hispanic activists when it passed 4-1 last August.

<HEADLINE> Confederate Air Force Questions Name  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- The Confederate Air Force has nothing to do with
the Civil War, but some members worry the name conjures up images
of racism -- costing them business.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we don't get the word Confederate out of our name, the
Confederate Air Force won't survive,'' Chris Avery, a pilot with
the organization, which flies World War II-era military planes at
air shows across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Avery, 35, said he was told by two air show organizers this year
that the name Confederate was becoming a public relations problem.
He says he's lost $10,000 in air show bookings this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''They said they love the airplane and the act, but that they
were getting pressure about being associated with a group with a
name like ours,'' he told The Dallas Morning News in Saturday's
editions. ''I'm finding myself spending more and more time
defending a name that has nothing to do with what our mission is.''
</P>
<P>
   The Midland, Texas-based organization, which has 8,000 members
nationwide, got the name in the 1950s, when somebody painted it on
the tail of a P-51 Mustang fighter. At the time, the handful of
original members thought it was funny, so the name stuck.
</P>
<P>
   Spokeswoman Tina Corbett said a possible name change has been
under discussion for several months, and will continue at an annual
board meeting in July. She said it would require an amendment to
the organization's constitution.
</P>
<P>
   CAF member Jan Collmer said the organization inevitably will
face protests and controversy over the name.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Confederacy stuff was a good-old-boy joke that is now
completely worn out,'' he said. ''It is like a lightning rod
sticking up.''
</P>
<P>
   John White, a spokesman for the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People, said the organization did not have
an overall policy against everything Confederate. The NAACP has
protested the display of the Confederate flag on public grounds,
such as atop South Carolina's Capitol, and demanded Virginia stop
annual official proclamations honoring the Confederacy.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have no policy on whether somebody wants to hold a flag in
a museum, or wear it on their clothing or display it on their
airplanes,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Ex Michigan Mayor Convicted  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT HURON, Mich. (AP) -- Former Mayor Gerald Ackerman was
convicted of 10 felony counts in a retrial on charges of sexual
misconduct with three underage girls.
</P>
<P>
   Ackerman, the tattooed, motorcycle-riding former mayor once
hailed as a role model for overcoming drugs and alcohol, was being
retried on 10 felony counts of criminal sexual conduct with three
girls aged 8, 11 and 12.
</P>
<P>
   The St. Clair County jury deliberated for about two hours before
returning the guilty verdicts Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Ackerman was found guilty of having sex and oral sex with the 8-
and 12-year-old girls, as well as fondling them and taking explicit
photos of them. It also found him guilty of forcing an 11-year-old
girl to fondle him.
</P>
<P>
   A jury convicted Ackerman, 43, of nine counts of indecent
exposure in October but deadlocked on the 10 felony counts. He was
sentenced to a year in jail on the indecent exposure conviction,
which is under appeal.
</P>
<P>
   During trial, Ackerman denied molesting children at Clear
Choices, the youth center he founded and directed. It went defunct
after his arrest on April 6, 1999. Ackerman resigned as mayor the
next day.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am not a pedophile,'' he told the jury. ''Children don't
turn me on. I am not sexually excited by children.''
</P>
<P>
   His court-appointed attorney, Sharon Parrish, argued that the
children told different versions of events in which they were
molested.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutor Peter George said the office spent ''hundreds of
hours'' analyzing and researching the case.
</P>
<P>
   ''The only thing worse than the betrayal of the public trust is
the betrayal of a child's trust,'' George said. ''The verdict today
confirms the defendant's guilt as to both.''
</P>
<P>
   Sentencing was scheduled for June 19. Ackerman faces up to life
in prison.

<HEADLINE> Questioning of Suharto To Resume  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- Investigators will resume questioning
ex-President Suharto about his alleged role in high-level
corruption despite Suharto's claims of ill health, Indonesia's
attorney general said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The interrogation of Suharto will from now on be conducted
routinely every Monday and Thursday,'' Marzuki Darusman told
reporters. He did not specify when the questioning would start.
</P>
<P>
   The 79-year-old former dictator has been named a top suspect in
a scandal involving the misuse of millions of dollars from
charitable foundations he controlled during his 32 years in power.
Suharto was forced from power by a pro-democracy movement in May
1998, leaving a legacy of endemic corruption and nepotism.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors have so far managed to briefly grill the former
strongman only once. Suharto's lawyers and doctors claim he is too
ill to testify. State attorneys have already questioned two of his
six children as well as some former senior officials.
</P>
<P>
   Suharto, who has been barred from leaving Jakarta, has denied
any wrongdoing. On Friday, thousands of students protested outside
Suharto's home and government offices and demanded he be tried for
corruption.
</P>
<P>
   A Jakarta court has ruled that prosecutors can freeze property
owned by Suharto and the foundations, which operated for decades
without any financial controls. Indonesia's new government has
instructed its embassies abroad to catalog all overseas assets held
by the former dictator.
</P>
<P>
   President Abdurrahman Wahid has promised to pardon Suharto if he
returns any illegally acquired gains.

<HEADLINE> Quake Jolts Pakistan, Afghanistan  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) -- A powerful earthquake rattled
northern Pakistan and neighboring Afghanistan early Saturday, but
there were no immediate reports of casualties or damage.
</P>
<P>
   The quake, with a preliminary magnitude of 5.8, was centered in
Afghanistan's northern Hindu Kush mountain range, roughly 150 miles
northwest of Pakistan's northern border city of Peshawar, said an
official at the meteorological department.
</P>
<P>
   The earthquake was felt for several seconds in Peshawar and
nearby areas at 4 a.m., he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Afghanistan, several northern provinces, where previous
earthquakes have killed thousands of people, were shaken by the
quake, said Bar Yallahi, a spokesman for the Afghan opposition,
which controls the region.
</P>
<P>
   The worst hit was Badakshan province, located 210 miles
northeast of the Afghan capital Kabul. But no damage has been
reported so far, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Kabul, controlled by the Taliban Islamic militia, people
rushed out of their homes, chanting verses from Islam's holy book,
the Koran, witnesses said.

   COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- A man who committed suicide in a hospital

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Officials declared a health emergency Saturday in
a southern Russian region as the number of people reported to have
come down with hemorrhagic fever rose to 14.
</P>
<P>
   Stavropol region governor Alexander Chernogorovy made the
announcement after a meeting with Deputy Minister of Health Gennady
Onishchenko, the ITAR-Tass news agency said. Chernogovory said
local authorities needed federal money to help fight ticks, which
carry the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Two people have died in Stavropol, located about 750 miles south
of Moscow, in the outbreak.
</P>
<P>
   ITAR-Tass said that three people died of the fever last year in
Stavropol, and that before that, there hadn't been a case of
hemorrhagic fever reported in the area for 27 years.
</P>
<P>
   The fever causes high temperatures, joint pains, chills and
sometimes bleeding. In extreme cases it can be fatal.

<HEADLINE> Feds Monitor Air Near Los Alamos  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY MASSEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA FE, N.M. (AP) -- At a checkpoint on the main road leading
into fire-ravaged Los Alamos, officers turning back evacuees and
sightseers wore white air-filter masks today as they worked through
thick smoke that has settled in the Rio Grande Valley.
</P>
<P>
   The fire that consumed forests and destroyed 260 homes in the
town of 11,000 has left a haze over much of northern New Mexico,
causing watery eyes and scratchy throats. Its proximity to the Los
Alamos National Laboratory has also spread concerns about nuclear
weapons stored there, though lab officals say there's no sign of
danger.
</P>
<P>
   ''Forest fire smoke contains a lot of really nasty compounds,''
said C. Mack Sewell, an epidemiologist in the state Health
Department. Among those are carbon monoxide.
</P>
<P>
   For days, the smoke has hung over portions of northern New
Mexico as a wildfire burned more than 36,000 acres in the Los
Alamos area. A shift in wind direction Friday pushed the smoke into
Santa Fe, 35 miles to the southeast. A haze partly obscured the
Sangre de Cristo Mountains northeast of the city and an acrid odor
lingered in the air.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can't go outside. It hurts your throat. We left town the
last couple of nights because it was so bad,'' said Terry Mulert,
36, who lives in tiny Cordova, north of Santa Fe, with his wife and
2-year-old son.
</P>
<P>
   Health officials said that the smoke was causing watery eyes,
scratchy throats and runny noses across the region, but that the
health problems should fade with the smoke. They advised people to
remain indoors with windows shut if they have respiratory problems
such as asthma, or if they feel eye and throat irritation.
</P>
<P>
   Because of questions about pollution and health hazards from the
fire, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the state
Environment Department were installing independent air monitoring
equipment to measure potential contaminants from the smoke.
</P>
<P>
   The fire also spread through the 43 square miles and 50
technical sites of Los Alamos National Laboratory, though officials
there said no radioactive materials were burned. A lab spokesman
said air monitoring has detected no elevated levels of
radioactivity in the area.
</P>
<P>
   The lab, which is part of the federal nuclear weapons complex,
permanently operates an air monitoring network on its property and
nearby areas. Once the fire began, it also placed air sampling
devices in outlying towns -- some up to 40 miles away -- to test the
smoke plume.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are a lot of rumors floating around. This is to give
that extra comfort level to the public to rest assured their health
is not being impacted by radioactivity,'' said Doug Stavert, the
lab's air quality group leader.
</P>
<P>
   The lab has maintained that its main supplies of radioactive
materials and high explosives are safely protected from the fire in
reinforced buildings or concrete bunkers.
</P>
<P>
   But questions remain about buried dumps on lab property -- some
dating to early atomic bomb work in the 1940s -- that contain
millions of cubic feet of wastes contaminated with plutonium,
uranium and tritium.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the continuing fire threat, the lab hasn't been able
to survey the waste sites to determine which ones were burnt,
Stavert said.

<HEADLINE> GOP Plugs Breast Cancer Bill  </HEADLINE>
By SHANNON McCAFFREY
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans used their Mother's Day weekend
radio address today to tout newly passed legislation that provides
treatment to low-income women stricken with breast and cervical
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Rick Lazio, R-N.Y., a co-sponsor of the bill that passed in
the House this week, delivered the nationwide message as he is
being thrust into the spotlight as a possible replacement for
Rudolph Giuliani should the New York City mayor bow out of the
Senate race. Giuliani's recent diagnosis of prostate cancer and his
marital woes and alleged infidelities have fueled speculation that
he will abandon his Senate bid against first lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio said the Breast and Cervical Cancer Treatment Act is the
needed follow up to legislation passed in 1990 providing free
cancer screening for low-income women. The new bill gives states
the option of providing Medicaid coverage to low-income women such
as those who are diagnosed with breast or cervical cancer through
the early detection program.
</P>
<P>
   ''Can you imagine anything more terrifying than being informed
that you have a form of cancer that can kill you and then being
told 'Sorry, this federal program only provides money for
screening. Now that you know you're on your own,''' Lazio said.
</P>
<P>
   ''To diagnose cancer in low-income women and then to usher them
to the door and wave them a cheery goodbye is unethical.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the legislation, the federal government would pay 75
percent of treatment expenses and the states would pay the other 25
percent. The cost to the federal government would be about $280
million over five years. The measure passed the House 421-1 on
Tuesday and was sent to the Senate.

<HEADLINE> Fires Spread to S. New Mexico  </HEADLINE>
By CHAKA FERGUSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEED, N.M. (AP) -- Howling winds slung fire down a narrow 20-mile
swath of southern New Mexico, quickly spreading the fire over
20,700 acres and forcing 125 people to flee scattered mountain
cabins before firefighters made headway in stanching the blaze.
</P>
<P>
   The southern New Mexico villages of Sacramento and Weed -- and
several canyon enclaves in the Sacramento Mountains -- were among
areas evacuated late Thursday and early Friday as a small fire
caused by a downed power line mushroomed into a major inferno,
fanned by 70-mph winds, forest spokeswoman Denise Ottaviano said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was just amazing how fast and furious that fire grew. It's
a narrow fire, but very long -- 20 miles long,'' Ottaviano said.
</P>
<P>
   But firefighters managed to gain some ground on the blaze.
</P>
<P>
   Fire spokeswoman Mary Stuever said the fire was 50 percent
contained and firefighters expect to have full containment by
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The fire in southern New Mexico burned about 200 miles from the
blaze in Los Alamos that had torched 36,000 acres and destroyed 260
homes by Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The southern fire burned at least 20 structures -- including
homes -- in Weed, where a highway sign reads, ''Welcome to Weed.
Population 20.''
</P>
<P>
   Evacuees gathered at Cloudcroft High School about 20 miles west
of the fire's cutting edge. Some went back for a look at the damage
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was our house,'' Randy Walker said, pointing to the
smoldering ruins of what used to be a three-bedroom home.
</P>
<P>
   ''The only thing we got out of it was a few pictures and a few
clothes,'' said Walker, who fled the home Thursday night and
returned Friday morning to survey the fire's handiwork.
</P>
<P>
   The fire -- sparked by a downed electrical line -- skipped over
some canyon slopes, torched others and passed by Weed and
Sacramento about 5 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   Ottaviano, a Lincoln National Forest spokeswoman, said the fire
grew too fast for firefighters to keep up with it.
</P>
<P>
   Otero County Commission Chairman Richard Zierlein has asked Gov.
Gary Johnson to declare the fire a disaster so funds expended would
be reimbursed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Not all was lost -- among 18 homes in Sacramento, only a shed
appeared to be burned. Flames stopped 20 feet short of Karen Hall's
log cabin, rebuilt after a 1974 fire.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's the center of our family, where everybody comes. This is
home,'' said Hall of Las Cruces, who took time off from her
teaching job to check the cabin. ''We skinned every one of those
logs ourselves.''

<HEADLINE> Mayor still mulling over whether he'll stay in Senate race  </HEADLINE>
By DONNA DE LA CRUZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Mayor Rudolph Giuliani says he's still mulling
over whether he'll remain in the U.S. Senate race or drop out
because of his prostate cancer and his personal problems.
</P>
<P>
   But the mayor on Friday promised a decision as soon as possible.
He made it clear that his health was priority No.1 when he talked
about possibly canceling a few events next week, including several
fund-raisers.
</P>
<P>
   ''If some things are canceled, that's the reason they're being
canceled,'' he said. ''There are things I couldn't do this week
that I'm going to have to do next week.''
</P>
<P>
   A fund-raising trip slated for several cities in California next
Tuesday and Wednesday was still tentative, but could easily be
rescheduled, said Giuliani campaign spokeswoman Juleanna Glover
Weiss.
</P>
<P>
   ''We still very much believe that he is running,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani has just one event on his campaign schedule in the next
few days -- a Town Hall meeting next Thursday in Manhattan. He
canceled a trip to Oneonta for tonight's Delaware County Republican
dinner.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor dined out Friday night with Judith Nathan, the woman
he's described as his ''very good friend.'' The two were joined by
several mayoral aides at an Italian restaurant on the Upper East
Side of Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani and Nathan smiled for photographers and strolled to
Nathan's home with the aides. She kissed each one on the cheek and
gave the mayor a goodbye hug. Just a few hours earlier, Giuliani's
wife, Donna Hanover, flew to California for a Mother's Day visit
with her parents. The mayor announced this week that the two are
separating.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the political speculation provoked by the announcement,
his supporters urged him not to abandon the race. During the
mayor's weekly radio show Friday, a caller who identified herself
as Susan from Brooklyn called Giuliani ''a national treasure.''
</P>
<P>
   Later in the show, Al from Long Island practically begged
Giuliani to stay in the Senate race against Democrat Hillary Rodham
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd like to call you Senator Giuliani because I think you
deserve it,'' Al said. ''I would hate to see you back down because
you're a real man. ... A man like yourself is hard to find.''
</P>
<P>
   Another caller, Michael from New Jersey, told Giuliani he should
finish his term as mayor, then run for governor.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think your talents would be wasted as a cog in the
slow-moving bureaucracy of the Senate,'' Michael said. ''I just
don't think you're suited for that, to be honest with you.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani told Michael other people have said the same thing to
him, and others have urged him to stay in the Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think being in the Senate would be a great honor and it
would be a great place to continue the kind of work that I've done
for the city of New York, and to spread it to the entire state, and
to some extent ... to the rest of the country,'' Giuliani said.
''And I think a change in role is good for you. I think people can
do a lot of different things in their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the mayor repeatedly said Friday he has not yet decided
whether to remain in the Senate race. But he did say he had a
responsibility to the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm going to make a decision as quickly as I can responsibly
make it,'' he told reporters at a bill-signing event. ''I do feel
that I have an obligation to the party.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani again cited his prostate cancer and his personal
problems as the main factors he's weighing, but refused to comment
further on either subject. The mayor publicly announced two weeks
ago he was diagnosed with prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Two days ago, he disclosed he was seeking a legal separation
from Hanover, his wife of 16 years. Hanover responded by dropping
her own bombshell, alleging that their marital woes began several
years go over his relationship with a former press aide, Cristyne
Lategano-Nicholas.
</P>
<P>
   The tale of marital strife and alleged infidelity has filled
local papers for days, much to the mayor's dislike, and his
demeanor has been rather downcast. However, Oreo, a 7-month-old
Labrador puppy who licked Giuliani's face as he signed a bill
regarding the sterilization of dogs and cats adopted from shelters
or pet shops, seemed to perk him up a bit.
</P>
<P>
   As did one particular caller to his radio show.
</P>
<P>
   ''May all your problems be little ones,'' said Viola from
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ''Yeah, I agree with that,'' the mayor said.

<HEADLINE> Nigerians Beheaded in Saudi Arabia  </HEADLINE>
Eds: LEADS throughout to CLARIFY that execution was one of the
largest in recent years, sted the largest; ADD comment from
Nigerian embassy; no pickup
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) -- In one of the largest executions
here in two decades, Saudi Arabia beheaded seven Nigerians Saturday
for taking part in a bank heist.
</P>
<P>
   The penal authorities amputated the right hands and left feet of
three other Nigerians involved in the same armed robbery, the
Interior Ministry said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Executions and amputations in Saudi Arabia are carried out with
a sword in a public square. Saturday's executions took place in the
Red Sea port city of Jiddah.
</P>
<P>
   The Interior Ministry statement did not say where and when the
robbery took place.
</P>
<P>
   The Nigerians had stolen a car to rob the bank, where they
threatened the employees with cleavers, the statement said. They
flagged down another car for their getaway, attacking its driver
with cleavers and wounding him in the hand.
</P>
<P>
   The robbers found to be the masterminds of the crime were the
ones condemned to death, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Murder, armed robbery, drug smuggling and sexual crimes are
punishable by death under Saudi Arabia's strict interpretation of
Islamic laws, which also call for the amputation of hands and feet

executions and amputations, saying the accused do not receive fair
trials.

   A Nigerian Embassy official in Riyadh said the punishments were
harsh, but that they would not affect Nigeria's relations with
Saudi Arabia. Speaking on customary condition of anonymity, he said
the embassy had appealed for the men's lives to be spared, but its
appeals were rejected.

<P>
   The official said the Nigerians were in Saudi Arabia as visitors
when they were arrested.

<HEADLINE> Midwest Cleans Up From Deadly Storm  </HEADLINE>
By MARTHA RAFFAELE
<TEXT>
<P>
   In towns across the Midwest, residents were pulling debris from
their yards after a storm packing tornadoes, high winds and
baseball-sized hail cut a swath from North Texas to Michigan,
killing one person in Texas and injuring at least two dozen others.
</P>
<P>
   A 4-year-old Kansas girl died after a porch roof believed to
have been damaged by an earlier tornado collapsed on her.
</P>
<P>
   The storms weakened as they as they moved eastward today.
Forecasters said there had been more than 18 reports of tornadoes,
almost 150 of large hail, and more than 44 reports of wind damage.
</P>
<P>
   A 70-year-old man died when a twister touched down Friday
evening in Hill County, Texas, about 60 miles south of Dallas, said
Cpl. Charlie Morgan with the state Department of Public Safety. The
storm ripped roofs off houses and flipped mobile homes.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just walked out the back of my house and saw a black cloud
coming back down to the ground,'' said Pat Small, who lives near
Whitney, Texas. ''I saw it take several different shapes, and it
appeared at one point to be sucking water out of the lake.''
</P>
<P>
   In St. Nazianz, Wis., straight-line winds up to 110 mph and
baseball-size hail injured several people at a mobile home park
Friday night, said Nancy Crowley, Manitowoc County Emergency
Government spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   ''All of a sudden it started raining and the hail came and then
it got bigger and it just blasted through the windows,'' said St.
Nazianz resident Don Orth, sweeping up shattered window glass.
</P>
<P>
   About 28 people were injured as the storm hit east-central
Wisconsin. One person was in critical condition. About 3,000
customers of Wisconsin Public Service Corp. of Green Bay were left
without electricity.
</P>
<P>
   Across Arkansas, trees were downed and electricity knocked out
in several counties, and some homes were damaged near Pine Bluff,
authorities said. The National Weather Service said it received a
report of a funnel cloud near Magnet Cove.
</P>
<P>
   Storms also swept through Illinois with rain, high winds, hail
and at least two tornadoes in the southern part of the state.
Storms in the Chicago area contributed to flight delays and
cancellations at O'Hare and Midway airports. There were reports of
minor damage throughout the region.
</P>
<P>
   Thunderstorms pounded the northern half of Michigan's lower
peninsula, leaving behind a few downed trees. Several counties
reported hail, with the most extreme of baseball-sized hail
reported in Huron County.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Friday, a 4-year-old girl in Tonganoxie, Kan., died
after a porch roof collapsed on her. The roof was believed to have
been damaged by a tornado that hit Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Bill Graves declared the county a disaster area, which
could make the area eligible for federal assistance, a spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
   In Kansas City, Steve Okenfuss, managing partner of a Toyota
dealership, was left with hunks of twisted metal at what had been
his business.
</P>
<P>
   ''It looks like a big foot just smashed it,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Momentum Gains for Phone Tax Repeal  </HEADLINE>
By CURT ANDERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- On Mother's Day, traditionally one of the
busiest telephone calling days in America, millions of dutiful sons
and daughters will use the phone to wish mom well. Each time, they
will pay a tax established in 1898 to finance the Spanish-American
War.
</P>
<P>
   A century after that war's end, momentum is gaining to repeal
the 3 percent excise tax on telephone service in an election-year
Congress searching for popular accomplishments. The nearly $5
billion raised annually now goes into the government's general fund
for any federal expense.
</P>
<P>
   Easy approval of the repeal is expected by both Republicans and
Democrats when the bill is taken up this week by the House Ways and
Means Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Several factors have combined to set the stage for repeal,
including huge projected budget surpluses and a Republican
congressional leadership bent on cutting taxes whenever possible.
Perhaps the most important element is that the tax is now
considered part of the ''digital divide,'' a cost that hinders
lower-income people from gaining Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is clearly a great target for repeal,'' said the main
Republican sponsor, Rep. Rob Portman of Ohio. ''It is really a tax
on the Internet as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Originally imposed as a luxury tax when there were only 1,376
telephones in the United States, the tax is now collected on the
total bill of an estimated 252 million business and residential
telephone lines, including cellular phones and those hooked up to
fax machines and computer modems. People and businesses with
multiple phones often pay the tax several times a month.
</P>
<P>
   The tax has been repealed twice before, then brought back when
the United States entered World War I and during the Depression. It
has been raised, lowered, put on track for a phaseout that was
delayed numerous times and, finally, made permanent a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''One thing about Washington is that once a tax is on the books,
it's hard to get rid of it,'' said Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas,
chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation would repeal the tax 90 days after the bill is
signed into law. A vote of the full House is expected the week of
May 22.
</P>
<P>
   The tax hits lower-income people hardest. Families earning
between $10,000 and $30,000 a year spend between 3 percent and 4
percent of their incomes on telephone service, while those earning
$70,000 or more spend only about 1 percent, according to the Bureau
of Labor Statistics.
</P>
<P>
   ''Getting rid of the excise tax, especially on telephones, would
be great tax relief to the broad number of lower- and middle-class
people,'' said Rep. Charles Rangel of New York, the senior Democrat
on the Ways and Means Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Eliminating the tax would reduce government revenue by about $24
billion over five years. Some Democrats and the White House have
raised concern about slicing away that money while Social Security
still faces future insolvency and Medicare offers no prescription
drug benefit.
</P>
<P>
   A Clinton administration statement said repeal was a ''worthy
policy objective'' that must be weighed against these other
priorities. ''Phasing out of the tax cannot be considered in a
vacuum,'' said a joint statement from senior officials at the White
House and Treasury and Commerce Departments.
</P>
<P>
   But House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., last week made repeal
a key part of the GOP's ''E-Contract 2000'' agenda aimed at
appealing to the high-tech industry and computer users. A coalition
of telecommunications and consumer lobbying groups, ranging from
the American Electronics Association and AT&AMP;T to the Organization
of Chinese Americans, is pushing the bill.
</P>
<P>
   House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., called for repeal in
a much-publicized speech earlier this year on the Democratic
high-tech legislative agenda, but he has questioned whether
immediate elimination might be too costly.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think it should be taken out immediately because you
have to do things like this in an incremental way,'' Gephardt said.
A spokeswoman added, however, that the Democratic leader may well
support whatever bill emerges from the Ways and Means Committee.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, Finance Committee Chairman William Roth, R-Del.,
and Sen. John Breaux, D-La., have introduced a companion bill that
now has 25 sponsors, including six Democrats. Committee aides say a
strong, bipartisan House vote could deter Senate Democrats from
offering unrelated amendments that would slow the measure down.
</P>
<P>
   If that happens, Congress could pass the bill overwhelmingly --
just as lawmakers did earlier this year in ending the
Depression-era cap on earnings for Social Security recipients age
65 to 69. Once it was severed from more controversial issues -- just
as the phone tax repeal has been -- the Social Security bill passed
Congress unanimously and is now law.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   The bill is H.R. 3916.

<HEADLINE> Giuliani Cancels Campaign Speech  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Questioning whether he can salvage a Senate
bid against Hillary Rodham Clinton and weighing his health and
marital problems, New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani scrapped a
speech he was to deliver tonight to a Republican dinner.
</P>
<P>
   ''He needed to take some time to consider all his medical
treatment,'' campaign spokeswoman Kim Serafin said.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, diagnosed two weeks ago with prostate cancer and who
this week announced plans to separate from his wife, was to have
been the keynote speaker at tonight's Delaware County GOP dinner in
Oneonta.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's campaign manager, Bruce Teitelbaum, said that as of
this morning Giuliani had made no decision about the future of his
campaign and wouldn't do so until he had had more time to consider
his medical options.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know what he's going to do,'' Teitelbaum said.
</P>
<P>
   The state party must nominate a candidate for the Senate race at
its convention May 30.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani spent part of Friday with his political advisers. A
source familiar with the discussions, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said Giuliani sounded increasingly discouraged about the
campaign's prospects.
</P>
<P>
   His pessimism was reflected in ''the type of questions that he's
asking and the kinds of comments he's making after we give him
answers,'' the source said.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, 55, announced two weeks ago he had treatable prostate
cancer. This week, he disclosed he was seeking a legal separation
from his wife of 16 years, Donna Hanover. Hanover alleged that
their marital woes began several years ago over his relationship
with a former press aide.
</P>
<P>
   New polls indicate that voter dissatisfaction over the mayor's
marital problems and concern about his health could become factors
in his race with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   A New York Daily News/New York 1 poll released Friday found that
81 percent of New York voters said Giuliani's marital problems are
a private matter. Nonetheless, 11 percent said the issue was
relevant and made them see him more negatively as a candidate.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if the combination of factors -- his treatable
prostate cancer, the separation and his wife's claim that he had a
previous relationship with a former staff member -- meant he should
get out of the race, 63 percent said he should continue to run.
Seventeen percent said he should pack up his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Asked Friday if he found the results heartening, Giuliani said:
''No, this is a very highly personal matter. My focus and concern
are for all the people involved in it. I've never paid an awful lot
of attention to polls.''
</P>
<P>
   A New York Post/Fox TV poll from the end of April, conducted by
Zogby International just after Giuliani announced he had cancer,
found 12 percent of voters said the disease meant he was no longer
a strong candidate. Eighty-two percent said he remained a strong
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Several Republicans have indicated they might be willing to step
into the race if Giuliani bows out. They include Reps. Rick Lazio
and Peter King, Wall Street financier Theodore Forstmann, and state
Assembly Minority Leader John Faso.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani made it clear that his health was his top priority when
he talked about possibly canceling a few political events next
week, including several fund-raisers.
</P>
<P>
   ''If some things are canceled, that's the reason they're being
canceled,'' he said. ''There are things I couldn't do this week
that I'm going to have to do next week.''

<HEADLINE> GOP's Lazio Touts Women Cancer Bill  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The federal government pays for breast and
cervical cancer tests for poor women and should start covering the
cost of treatment, a Republican congressman said Saturday in the
party's Mother's Day weekend radio address.
</P>
<P>
   ''Can you imagine anything more terrifying than being informed
that you have a form of cancer that can kill you and then being
told 'Sorry, this federal program only provides money for
screening. Now that you know you're on your own,''' said Rep. Rick
Lazio, co-sponsor of a bill that would pay for treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ''For all our noble intent, our piecemeal approach to this issue
created a situation that was morally intolerable,'' said Lazio,
R-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The measure passed the House 421-1 on Tuesday and was sent to
the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio delivered the address amid increased attention about his
possible Senate candidacy should Mayor Rudolph Giuliani of New York
City mayor bow out of the race. Giuliani's recent diagnosis of
prostate cancer and his marital woes have increased speculation he
will abandon his Senate bid against Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio said the Breast and Cervical Cancer Treatment Act is the
needed follow-up to legislation passed in 1990 providing free
cancer screening for low-income women.
</P>
<P>
   The new legislation gives states the option of providing
Medicaid coverage to low-income women such as those diagnosed with
breast or cervical cancer through the early detection program.
</P>
<P>
   ''To diagnose cancer in low-income women and then to usher them
to the door and wave them a cheery goodbye is unethical,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the legislation, the federal government would pay 75
percent of treatment expenses and the states would pay the other 25
percent. The cost to the federal government would be about $280
million over five years.

<HEADLINE> Police, Mob Clash in Jakarta  </HEADLINE>
By IRWAN FIRDAUS
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- Police fired tear gas and warning
shots at angry mobs of people in Chinatown on Saturday in clashes
that began when officials tried to remove street vendors from the
area's crowded sidewalks, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   As the first mob fled the police assault, it threw rocks that
broke the windows of a McDonald's restaurant and a BMW dealership,
and set fire to at least one police motorcycle, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of people were taken away in police vans, and four
arrested, said police officer Pramono, who like many Indonesians
uses only one name.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty policemen were injured, said police chief Col.
Guliansyah, and many of the shops in Chinatown closed to avoid the
violence. Hundreds of police lined the streets after the mob fled.
</P>
<P>
   By midday, the area reopened to traffic and pedestrians, but
police remained on the scene.
</P>
<P>
   About two hours later, another rock-throwing mob formed and
police fired tear gas in violence that closed Chinatown again. At
least six people were injured and seen being taken away in
ambulances.
</P>
<P>
   The clashes took place two years after a student-led,
pro-democracy movement's massive protests and riots forced
President Suharto to resign. Some of that violence targeted
Indonesia's wealthy but small Chinese minority, especially in
Chinatown, where a shopping mall was burned down.
</P>
<P>
   But police said the dispute Saturday did not seem to involve
animosity between Indonesia's majority Muslims and minority
Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, hundreds of students clashed with police outside
Suharto's home in Jakarta in a protest demanding that he be
convicted and punished for alleged corruption during his 32 years
in power. But there didn't seem to be any connection between that
violence and Saturday's.
</P>
<P>
   Pramono said the Chinatown clashes began when officials tried to
clear the sidewalks of the many vendors who gather there each day
to sell items such as pirated video compact discs, some of which
contain pornography.
</P>
<P>
   The vendors responded by throwing rocks and the small tables and
beach umbrellas they use to sell their products on the crowded
sidewalks, setting off the police attack, Pramono said.
</P>
<P>
   In the assault on the BMW dealership, the mob ransacked the
showroom and burned one of its computers, Pramono said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was not an anti-Chinese attack. This was just criminals
who illegally sell hot property in front of our shops,'' said
Johanes Wijaya, 50, an Indonesian-Chinese shop-owner who rushed to
his electronics store in Chinatown when he heard about the
violence.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, he said he was happy that police quickly responded
to prevent the violence from targeting Jakarta's Chinese minority.
</P>
<P>
   Since coming to power in October, President Abdurrahman Wahid, a
reformist Muslim cleric with a Chinese ancestor, has promoted
religious tolerance in Indonesia and lifted a long-standing ban on
public Chinese festivities, such as the Chinese Lunar New Year in
February.
</P>
<P>
   The government also now allows the minority to operate
Chinese-language schools and to use store signs written in Chinese
characters.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Using Elian Case To Prod Cuba  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE GEDDA
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration believes it struck
a blow for family reunification when it returned Elian Gonzalez to
his father. And in talks with Cuban officials, it will use that
case as leverage in efforts on behalf of Cubans prevented from
joining U.S.-based relatives.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials believe there are hundreds of Cubans with U.S.
visas who have not been allowed to leave Cuba because they lack
exit visas.
</P>
<P>
   The officials expect to raise the matter at the next bilateral
meeting on migration issues -- the only issue on which regular
contacts exist.
</P>
<P>
   At that session, Cuba will have its own set of grievances,
particularly American policies that it says encourage illegal
migration and have caused the deaths of countless fleeing Cubans
over the years.
</P>
<P>
   The last meeting on migration issues was held in December. The
next tentatively was set for this month but may be delayed.
</P>
<P>
   The officials say it is inconsistent for Cuba to have demanded
that Elian be turned over to his father while ignoring the plight
of Cubans denied permission to join U.S.-based relatives.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. rules permit 20,000 Cubans to migrate to the United States
annually. Preference goes to Cubans with close family ties in the
United States. Refugees also receive priority consideration. In
addition, U.S. officials run an annual visa lottery in which the
winners are chosen by chance.
</P>
<P>
   Elian Gonzalez was forcibly seized by U.S. immigration agents on
April 22 from Miami relatives and transferred to the custody of his
father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez. They are awaiting a court decision on
whether the boy should be allowed to return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., said Cuban reluctance to permit the
departure of Cubans with U.S. visas demonstrates ''the hypocrisy of
(President Fidel) Castro's position on family reunification.''
</P>
<P>
   While lacking precise figures, Cuban officials say the Clinton
administration exaggerates when it claims that hundreds are
awaiting exit visas. To the extent that a family was split by a
defection, the Cuban side argues the blame rests with the defector
and not the Cuban government.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Cuba believes that a citizen who has had long years
of the free education Cuba provides has a duty to pay back by using
his skills, at least for several years, before being allowed to
emigrate.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials cite two prominent cases in which Cuban families
have not been allowed to reunite.
</P>
<P>
   One involves Luis Grave de Peralta, a dissident scientist who
was freed from prison in 1996 through the efforts of then-Rep. Bill
Richardson, D-N.M. He was granted permission to come to the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Grave de Peralta said last week in a telephone interview from
Lubbock, Texas, that the Cuban mission in Havana has granted exit
visas to six children from his family, but not to six adults even
though, he says, Richardson had received assurances that all 12
would be permitted to leave.
</P>
<P>
   One of the six children, Grave de \ 13-year-old son, joined him
in Lubbock a week ago.
</P>
<P>
   A second case cited by officials involves Jose Cohen of Miami, a
former Cuban intelligence officer whose wife and three children are
stranded in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba, meanwhile, is launching a campaign to encourage Washington
to annul a 1966 law that allows Cubans who reach U.S. shores to
remain in the United States, a right granted to people of no other
nationality.
</P>
<P>
   Many have drowned in the process, including Elian's mother, who
died while attempting a crossing with her son in November.
</P>
<P>
   Castro has referred to the 1966 law as a ''killing machine.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration does not encourage Cubans to
undertake the dangerous trek but says Cubans wishing to leave
should take advantage of opportunities available for risk-free
emigration.

<HEADLINE> Couple's alleged heists through Connecticut, Massachusetts comes to an end </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   A couple's lucrative six-week robbery spree through
southwestern
Connecticut and the Boston area came to an end this week when the
FBI was tipped to their New York City hideout, authorities said.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thomas Beard, 40, and Marta Lozada, 33, of Massachusetts, were
taken into custody without incident Thursday at a Bronx apartment
where they had been staying for several days, police said. The bank
heists netted the suspects more than $50,000 in cash, according to
an FBI affidavit released Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Lozada was charged with one count of bank robbery and conspiracy
in connection with the April 28 robbery of the People's Bank on
East Putnam Avenue in Greenwich.
</P>
<P>
   Beard, who has a prior conviction for bank robbery, was charged
by the FBI Friday with four counts of bank robbery for a series of
holdups in the Boston area in late March.
</P>
<P>
   Agents said Beard's estranged wife identified him through bank
surveillance tapes.
</P>
<P>
   ''(The wife) stated that she was sure it was her husband,'' FBI
Agent Gary Cacace wrote in an arrest affidavit. ''(She) stated that
in one or more of the photos, Beard was wearing clothes that she
recognized as clothes she had bought for him.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple, who are described in police documents as drug users,
are also suspects in a spate of bank robberies in Norwalk, Darien
and Milford, Conn. and an attempted robbery in Rye, N.Y., according
to court papers.
</P>
<P>
   Both were being held in federal custody without bail.
</P>
<P>
   It was Beard's distinctive holdup notes and his prior
convictions for bank robbery that linked him and his female
companion to the crimes, FBI agents said.

   ''This is a robbery. Large bills. No dye,'' was scrawled on most

   No weapons were shown in any of the robberies.

   Beard used a nearly identical holdup note when he robbed the
Quincy Savings Bank in Quincy, Mass., on Jan. 7, 1994. He was
subsequently convicted for that robbery and for a second holdup at
Fleet Bank in Randolph, Mass., on Jan. 14, 1994.

   The FBI alleges Beard started robbing banks again in March.

<HEADLINE> Japan Smoking Targets Vague  </HEADLINE>
By GARY SCHAEFER
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- When health officials drew up Japan's latest
10-year national fitness plan, they decided numerical targets were
just what the doctor ordered.
</P>
<P>
   So, for the first time, the Healthy Japan 21 initiative features
quantifiable goals, from reducing the number of heavy drinkers by
20 percent to getting people to walk an extra 1,000 steps a day.
</P>
<P>
   But when it comes to smoking, the plan loses its precision. It
promises only to ensure that people get ''sufficient knowledge''
about the risks of smoking.
</P>
<P>
   The wording is hardly a surprise. The powerful Finance Ministry
owns 60 percent of the nation's largest tobacco company and is
committed by law to ''promote the health and development of the
Japanese tobacco industry.''
</P>
<P>
   With a male smoking rate of 54 percent -- far higher than in
America or Europe -- critics are asking whether bureaucratic pride
and industry profits aren't taking precedence over public safety.
</P>
<P>
   According to a World Health Organization study cited in the
plan, cigarettes were responsible for up to 95,000 premature deaths
in Japan in 1995. That was 12 percent of all deaths that year.
</P>
<P>
   Smoking-related disease and deaths added $11.1 billion to the
nation's health bill in 1993, according to a private foundation
affiliated with the Health Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   ''Shortsighted interests have been given priority over the
health of the nation,'' said an editorial in the Asahi, one of
Japan's largest newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   The ministry says the plan is intended to help people make their
own lifestyle choices. It says the decision not to set a specific
target was made after hearing a variety of opinions from smokers
and the tobacco industry.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Health Ministry really wants to reduce smoking, but it
can't overcome the structural barriers,'' said Bungaku Watanabe, a
veteran anti-smoking activist who organized an unsuccessful
petition drive to include numerical smoking targets in the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Japan is a smoker's paradise. Nonsmoking sections in restaurants
are a relatively new concept. Smoking cars on trains are often more
numerous than nonsmoking ones. Cigarette vending machines are
everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   When a draft of the Health Ministry's plan was released last
summer, it included as goals cutting in half both the number of
smokers and total tobacco consumption by 2010.
</P>
<P>
   During months of public hearings, health officials received
2,021 comments and complaints, 90 percent of which were aimed at
the anti-smoking goals.
</P>
<P>
   Cigarette retailers gathered 53,700 signatures on a petition,
and the National Central Union of Tobacco Cultivation Associations,
the lobbying group for the country's 23,000 tobacco farmers, called
on the Health Ministry to ''act appropriately'' on the farmers'
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   The governing Liberal Democratic Party weighed in with a
resolution warning the ministry that the plan's anti-smoking
objectives were ''constitutionally problematic.''
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco is pound-for-pound one of the most valuable crops to
Japan's farmers, who in turn are among the governing party's most
important supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ''Without the support of agriculture, the LDP probably couldn't
stay in power,'' said Minoru Morita, a political analyst. ''When
the farmers talk, the LDP listens.''
</P>
<P>
   The economic impact of tobacco is hard to deny. Japanese
cigarette makers sold $37.6 billion worth of tobacco products in
1998 and generated $15.2 billion in national and local taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinary smokers also aren't happy about any crusade against
tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   ''Look how far the government has gone in America -- it's like
the return of Prohibition or something,'' said 35-year-old Fumio
Takahashi, flicking ashes from his Hi-Lite cigarette at a Tokyo
cafe.
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco industry officials also have played on concerns about
government acting as big brother.
</P>
<P>
   ''What about sugar? It's linked to diabetes,'' said Noriaki
Sumiya, spokesman for the Japan Tobacconist Federation. ''The next
thing you know we're going to be told how many spoons of sugar we
should put in our coffee.''
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of a stronger anti-smoking campaign lament the
watering down of the health plan's goals.
</P>
<P>
   ''I guess more people have to die from cigarettes before the
issue of smoking is taken seriously in this country,'' said Dr.
Akira Oshima, director of research at the Osaka Medical Center for
Cancer and Cardiovascular Diseases.

<HEADLINE> Sierra Leone Junta Leader Returns  </HEADLINE>
By ALEXANDRA ZAVIS
<TEXT>
<P>
   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) -- Until recently, Johnny Paul Koroma
was the loathed leader of an ex-junta whose forces helped rebels
ravage Freetown, burning, looting, maiming and killing thousands.
</P>
<P>
   Today he is hailed as the savior of this war-weary capital, the
one who can rescue the city from a feared rebel assault. People
wave and cheer as truckloads of Koroma's followers, bristling with
guns, race past.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are going to protect us,'' said a shouting and clapping
Mohammed Kabbah. ''We have to forgive them. They are like prodigal
sons.''
</P>
<P>
   Most here have lost confidence in the United Nations' ability to
hold together a ragged July peace accord that was supposed to end
eight years of brutal civil war. Revolutionary United Front rebels
have robbed U.N. troops of their guns, equipment -- even their
clothes -- in a series of encounters in the country's interior. They
are currently holding about 500 U.N. personnel captive.
</P>
<P>
   As clashes between the RUF and U.N. troops moved closer to the
capital this week, Koroma went on national radio to rally hundreds
of his supporters to the defense of a power-sharing government in
which he chairs a commission on the consolidation of peace.
</P>
<P>
   ''Once a soldier, always a soldier,'' Koroma said during an
interview Friday, leaning back in an overstuffed sofa in his dimly
lighted study, where a young fighter with a rifle slung over his
shoulder hovered in the background. ''I cannot sit by as a soldier
and see my country under threat.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside, soldiers in blue jeans and dark sunglasses loaded
machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades onto a truck in a haze
of marijuana smoke.
</P>
<P>
   President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah, whose government was overthrown by
Koroma in 1997, has welcomed the support of his former enemy, and
made no attempt to stop ex-junta soldiers from rearming.
</P>
<P>
   ''I really believe that people have vented enough anger and
irritation regarding what the army did before,'' Kabbah's
spokesman, Septimus Kai Kai, said at the heavily defended
presidential residence.
</P>
<P>
   ''Given this opportunity, I really believe they are trying to do
everything possible to remake their images, to rededicate
themselves to the country,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kai Kai noted that one of Koroma's first acts when he returned
from exile in neighboring Liberia was to visit a Freetown camp for
war victims, and apologize to men, women and children whose hands,
legs, noses and ears were hacked off by rebels in a systematic
campaign of terror.
</P>
<P>
   ''We found him to be remorseful of whatever it is he may have
done in the past, and we found that he is willing to work with us
to resolve the crisis in the country,'' Kai Kai said.
</P>
<P>
   Koroma claims that the reason he seized power in 1997 and
invited the RUF into the government was for the sake of peace. At
the time, he says, corrupt politicians profiting from the civil war
showed no willingness to let the fighting end.
</P>
<P>
   His regime was toppled by a Nigerian-led West African
intervention force. He became disillusioned with his rebel allies
soon after, as they fought side by side against the intervention
force, known as ECOMOG.
</P>
<P>
   ''When we invited them out of the bush we were very, very
friendly with them,'' Koroma said. ''When we went to them (after
being forced from power), they were hostile with us.''
</P>
<P>
   He claims no knowledge of his followers' role in a rebel assault
on Freetown in January 1999 during which thousands were maimed,
raped and killed, because the rebels had placed him under house
arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Now a born-again Christian, Koroma insists he has no lingering
presidential aspirations.
</P>
<P>
   ''I am not interested in power. If I want power I will go
through the ballot box,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That is little comfort to some anxious Sierra Leoneans who
remember the looting and burning sprees after Koroma seized power.
</P>
<P>
   While insisting there were no preconditions for the ex-junta's
support, Koroma warned that the government has a responsibility to
the soldiers who have rallied to its defense.
</P>
<P>
   ''The government must keep to its responsibility or they might
have problems with the civilian populace,'' he said, adding
ominously: ''even the troops will not be happy.''

<HEADLINE> Pinelands Commission eases cost of development credits  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SOUTHAMPTON, N.J. (AP) -- The agency that manages growth in the
ecologically sensitive Pinelands region has approved new rules that
could lower the cost of building homes in certain areas.
</P>
<P>
   The Pinelands Commission approved rule changes Friday designed
to prevent towns from granting zoning variances that differ
significantly from the Pinelands master plan for development.
</P>
<P>
   Developers wishing to build residential units in commercial
zones such as Route 72 in Stafford Township or the Black Horse Pike
in Hamilton must buy additional building rights, called Pinelands
development credits.
</P>
<P>
   The credits are building rights sold by owners of
environmentally sensitive land where construction is strictly
limited.
</P>
<P>
   The system is designed to compensate owners of such land, as
well as to steer builders to more suitable areas for construction.
</P>
<P>
   The rule changes reduce the number of credits needed to build
residential developments of up to 20 units. Credits let developers
build more units per acre.
</P>
<P>
   The changes also should lower costs for individual property
owners who want waivers from Pinelands environmental rules, such as
building on odd-shaped lots near wetlands.
</P>
<P>
   Credits currently cost more than $20,000 apiece, which can
quickly add to the cost of building in the Pinelands.
</P>
<P>
   The changes did not come without opposition. Some commissioners
said the master plan should not be amended piecemeal. Commissioner
Candace Ashmun said the commission would be better off waiting for
an upcoming five-year review to make changes.
</P>
<P>
   She said the changes are ''looking for a problem to solve. We've
got to stop Band-Aiding the plan.''
</P>
<P>
   The changes apply only to 80,000 acres designated as regional
growth areas, which are targeted for the most intensive
development. These areas include Egg Harbor, Galloway and Hamilton
townships.
</P>
<P>
   The changes also make it easier to build assisted-living
facilities by treating them as residential rather than commercial
projects. Thus, builders of these facilities will no longer have to
buy additional development credits when building in approved growth
areas.
</P>
<P>
   The commission also formed a committee including the mayor of
Dennis, Mullica and Bass River townships to increase tourism by
creating a ''scenic byway'' between the communities.

<HEADLINE> Police: Liquor smuggling ring busted that reversed famous Prohibition route </HEADLINE>
By ANDREW Z. GALARNEAU
The Buffalo News
<TEXT>
<P>
   NIAGARA-ON-THE-LAKE, Ontario (AP) -- A small but highly organized
ring of liquor smugglers made millions of dollars ferrying untaxed
booze across the border in car trunks, Canadian and U.S.
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the booze crew accused of hauling $10,000 worth of
liquor in the trunk of a specially rigged car reversed the alcohol
smuggling route from Canada to the United States during Prohibition
in the 1920s.
</P>
<P>
   Led by David Pasquantino and Carl Pasquantino, brothers from
Niagara Falls, N.Y., the smuggling ring moved 40,000 cases of
low-quality liquor worth $5.6 million from stores in Maryland to
drinkers in southern Ontario, according to investigators of the
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and the Royal Canadian
Mounted Police.
</P>
<P>
   While avoiding some $4.1 million (U.S.) in Canadian taxes, the
smuggling ring made a profit of roughly $3 million, according to
law enforcement estimates.
</P>
<P>
   The Pasquantino brothers were among six U.S. citizens charged in
the scheme, investigators said Friday in Ontario. Six Canadians
were also charged.
</P>
<P>
   David Pasquantino, 53, was arrested in Maryland Wednesday night
after leaving a Maryland liquor store in a van loaded with 200
cases of whisky, vodka and rum, said Mike Campbell, spokesman for
ATF's Baltimore office. ''He asked us why we stopped him,''
Campbell said. ''Then he asked for his attorney.''
</P>
<P>
   Those 200 cases were headed to Ontario, authorities said. For at
least two years, hundreds of cases of bottom-shelf liquor left
Maryland liquor stores in vehicles driven by the booze crew,
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   The cases were stashed in the Niagara Falls area, according to
the indictments. With help from the Niagara County Sheriff's
Department, search warrants were served Thursday on units at 2365
Niagara Falls Blvd. and 2728 Niagara Falls Blvd. in Wheatfield,
Campbell said.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the liquor was loaded into the trunks of cars and driven
over the border, authorities said. One car seized as part of the
scheme was a 1985 Ford Crown Victoria with heavy-duty shock
absorbers controlled by an air valve under the rear bumper.
</P>
<P>
   ''We found 280 1.75 liter bottles of alcohol in the trunk,
weighing about a thousand pounds,'' said RCMP Constable Allen
Rodgers. The car rode about five inches high when empty, but
hunkered down into a normal profile when fully loaded, Rodgers
said.
</P>
<P>
   That one trunk load would fetch about $10,000 on the black
market in Ontario, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said that despite the well-organized smuggling
scheme, there was no solid evidence the group was related to
traditional organized crime groups.
</P>
<P>
   There were some indications some members of the group knew each
other from gambling locations, such as Casino Niagara and the Fort
Erie Racetrack, investigators said. They declined to be more
specific.
</P>
<P>
   In Ontario, the liquor was apparently sold mainly by individuals
to individuals, not to businesses and bars, said the RCMP's Linda
Martell. Customers ''were just your general next-door-neighbors,
people you might meet around the barbecue.''
</P>
<P>
   Charged in the United States with wire fraud were: David B.
Pasquantino, 53, and Carl J. Pasquantino, 52, both of Niagara
Falls; Francis A. Gillotti, 51, of North Tonawanda; Gerald T.
Ciccone, 57, of Town of Tonawanda; Cosmo D. Candido, 75, of Niagara
Falls; and Arthur ''Butch'' Hilts, 41, of Sanborn.
</P>
<P>
   Ciccone was also charged with interstate transportation of a
shotgun.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans were also charged in Canada with conspiracy to
smuggle, possess and distribute alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   Canadians, all from Ontario, charged were: Samuel Quaranta, 46,
of Niagara Falls; Joseph Prince, 57, of Stoney Creek; Terry Fraser,
76, of Niagara Falls; Donald MacDonald, 75, of Hamilton; Maralyn
Dusome, 39, of Stoney Creek; and Christine Martin, 42, of Niagara
Falls.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities are still considering whether to level charges
against the liquor stores and neighborhood bars in Maryland that
may have knowingly cooperated with the scheme, said BATF Canadian
attache David Krieghbaum.

<HEADLINE> Poverty Frames Philippine Rebellion  </HEADLINE>
By J.L. HAZELTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   ZAMBOANGA, Philippines (AP) -- At the heart of the Philippine
military's headquarters in the war against Islamic guerrillas is an
open-air Christian chapel.
</P>
<P>
   Little churches are scattered everywhere outside the base in
Zamboanga as well, nestled between shacks piled high with coconuts,
mangos, bananas and other produce. So are simple plastic shelters
put up by families without four solid walls to call home.
</P>
<P>
   Religion and poverty make for an explosive mix in the southern
Philippines, where two Muslim rebel groups were holding about 70
hostages -- including 40 people who were seized from the small
village of Pamantingan on Saturday by the Moro Islamic Liberation
Front.
</P>
<P>
   ''The rebels said they would behead us if we tried to escape,''
said 16-year-old Ricardo Gregorio, who was freed last week after
being held for 40 days by a second, smaller rebel group. ''It was
terrible up there, with the rebels up in the mountains. ... I'm
angry with the Abu Sayyaf, with the Muslims.''
</P>
<P>
   Their threat was not an idle one. The Abu Sayyaf rebels have
decapitated two of their hostages and have done the same to wounded
soldiers. A priest's toenails were pulled out before he was killed.
</P>
<P>
   Roman Catholicism is woven deeply into the lives of most
Filipinos. Bible texts appear in the newspapers every day. The Ten
Commandments hang behind judges on the bench. Priests say Mass in
urban shopping malls.
</P>
<P>
   But Islam came to what is now the southern Philippines with Arab
traders long before the Spanish claimed the whole stretch of
islands in the 16th century under the banner of the cross.
</P>
<P>
   As in the Americas, Spain used its missionaries to subdue,
control and convert the indigenous residents. But Mindanao's
Muslims boast they never succumbed.
</P>
<P>
   Muslims make up about 5 percent of the country's population of
74 million and are clustered mostly in Mindanao, so few Christian
Filipinos interact with their Islamic countrymen on a daily basis.
Stereotypes of Muslims as dangerous and crime-minded are rampant,
including in the media lately, where references to ''ragheads'' and
''dogs with rags wrapped around their heads'' have appeared in
opinion columns.
</P>
<P>
   Heightening Mindanao Muslims' longtime sense of dispossession
are the jobs, land and opportunities lost to Christian Filipino
migrants.
</P>
<P>
   Mindanao is the poorest region of the Philippines, a country so
destitute that children are still dying of measles. It is rich in
resources, however, including timber, fish and gold, but the per
capita annual income in its poorest Muslim provinces is about $200,
compared with more than $1,000 nationally.
</P>
<P>
   Though a four-province semiautonomous Muslim region was created
a decade ago, little development has survived the corruption and a
tight national budget.
</P>
<P>
   The governor, Nur Misuari, draws criticism for having difficulty
making the transition from rebel chief to statesman-manager.
</P>
<P>
   While much of Mindanao remains quiet, hundreds of thousands of
people have fled their homes in fear of the fighting. Stark lists
of the dead and wounded -- soldiers and civilians both -- scroll down
TV screens.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is probably the most serious security problem that has
confronted us since independence'' in 1946, said Senate Foreign
Relations Committee Chairman Francisco Tatad.
</P>
<P>
   The war began some three decades ago when Philippine dictator
Ferdinand Marcos was strengthening the central government's control
over possible separatist movements.
</P>
<P>
   The largest rebel group, Misuari's Moro National Liberation
Front, made peace in 1996, leaving the fringe Abu Sayyaf and the
much larger Moro Islamic Liberation Front, or MILF, to fight on,
along with a small communist insurgency.
</P>
<P>
   About 1,000 MILF guerrillas burst into Pamantingan in Sultan
Kudarat province on Saturday, stealing food and taking at least 40
people hostage as they escaped from pursuing government troops,
according to radio reports and officials.
</P>
<P>
   In similar attacks in the past, MILF rebels have released their
hostages unharmed under cover of darkness after completing their
escape.
</P>
<P>
   Abu Sayyaf is holding 21 Western and Asian hostages on the
island of Jolo in Mindanao province and another group of about nine
in the nearby province of Basilan.
</P>
<P>
   Freed from Basilan, 9-year-old Nova Verallo remembers playing
with the other young captives at the rebel camp during the day and
crying with loneliness at night. Twisting her hands together
constantly, she said Friday: ''I want to forget the rebels.''

<HEADLINE> Falun Gong Followers Beaten by Cops  </HEADLINE>
By CHARLES HUTZLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- Police punched, knocked over and dragged away
followers of the banned Falun Gong sect in Tiananmen Square on
Saturday as group members defiantly celebrated the spiritual
movement's eighth anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   Followers raised up banners and chrysanthemums -- all yellow, a
traditionally auspicious color adopted by Falun Gong. Their
separate protests lasted seconds before police pounced, hauling
them away. The flowers remained on the square's gray paving stones
until a street sweeping truck was brought in.
</P>
<P>
   Police punched and kicked five women who tried to unfurl a
banner. The beating continued even after they were forced into a
police van. Another woman, standing amid 10 followers, was sent
sprawling to the ground. Others had to be dragged away, half-seated
in a meditation pose, although many protesters did not resist.
</P>
<P>
   At least 50 people were taken away by police after staging
scattered acts of civil disobedience across the vast square in
central Beijing. Chinese and foreign tourists, who come to the
square by the thousands every day, gawked at the outbursts and the
frenzied police response.
</P>
<P>
   The rougher tactics on display underscored the frustration of
police, who have been unable to stop protests since the communist
government banned Falun Gong 9 1-2 months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's was the third in recent weeks to mark important sect
anniversaries. On April 25, followers came to Tiananmen to remember
a protest by 10,000 followers last year that provoked the
government's ban three months later. Thursday, they honored the
birthday of founder Li Hongzhi's birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday marked the sect's founding in 1992. The group has
declared the date the first World Falun Dafa Day, using another
name for the practice.
</P>
<P>
   In Hong Kong -- where the sect is not banned -- 150 practitioners
meditated, slowly performing exercises with their eyes closed, in a
park in the central business district. Events were also planned in
New York and other cities worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   An ex-government grain clerk, Li combined traditional meditation
exercises with Buddhist, Taoist and his own unorthodox ideas to
create Falun Gong. Practice is supposed to promote health and moral
living. Falun Gong attracted millions of followers in China.
</P>
<P>
   Li left China for New York in 1998, helping his movement attract
millions more around the world. But he dropped from public view
shortly after the July ban. His only trace: a photograph on Falun
Gong Web sites of Li meditating in the mountains. The picture
carries no date or location.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese leaders have called the group a public menace and a
threat to Communist Party authority. They have accused Falun Gong
of cheating people and causing 1,559 deaths, mostly among
practitioners who refused medical treatment. Human rights groups
estimate 5,000 followers have been sent to labor camps.
</P>
<P>
   Police knew protests were likely Saturday. Plainclothes police
with high-powered binoculars scanned the crowd for suspected
followers.
</P>
<P>
   Police also detained at least three foreign tourists Saturday,
apparently for photographing or videotaping protests. A uniformed
officer pushed and kicked one of the tourists into a police van.
</P>
<P>
   The government did not comment on the protests directly, but
sent its people signals that it is prevailing over the sect. State
television on the nationwide evening newscast ran a report on a
university student from a village outside Changchun, a northeastern
provincial capital, who had renounced Falun Gong.
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers reported that a leading U.S.-based religious
broadcaster supported the crackdown. On Friday, Paul Crouch,
president of the Trinity Broadcasting Network, defended China's
crackdown on the Falun Gong spiritual movement, saying the
government was protecting its citizens from a false and dangerous
cult.

   HAVANA (AP) -- With folk dances and political speeches, tens of
thousands of Cubans on Saturday celebrated the 45th anniversary of
Fidel Castro's release from prison by pressing for the return of
Elian Gonzalez to his communist homeland.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 50,000 government supporters massed outside the
prison on the Isle of Youth -- then known as the Isle of Pines --
where Castro was jailed for a little less than two years after he
led the disastrous July 26, 1953 attack that launched his
revolutionary battle.
</P>
<P>
   The rally on the island, located just south of Cuba's main
island, was led by Gen. Raul Castro, Fidel Castro's younger brother
and chief of the Revolutionary Armed Forces.
</P>
<P>
   Raul Castro was jailed on the island with his brother, and
released at the same time under a political amnesty by
then-President Fulgencio Batista.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our legacy for the present and future generations is ... we
are and will continue to be in a state of combat,'' said Pedro
Miret, vice president of Cuba's Council of Ministers and among
those who attacked the Moncada army barracks in the eastern city of
Santiago in 1953.
</P>
<P>
   ''Today, we say with our people: 'Bring back Elian!' '' Miret
shouted to the crowd decked out in T-shirts printed with the
6-year-old's image.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba has promised to keep up the fight for Elian's return until
his case is resolved.
</P>
<P>
   A three-judge panel of the 11th Circuit Court in Atlanta, one
step below the U.S. Supreme Court, heard arguments Thursday on a
request by Elian's Miami relatives that a political asylum hearing
be held for the boy. A ruling is not expected for several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Elian was rescued off the coast of Florida in late November
after his mother and 10 others died when their boat sank during an
illegal journey from Cuba to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Father and son were reunited in the United States last month
after an armed federal raid on the Miami relatives' home where they
boy had been staying. They must remain in the United States pending
the court's decision.

<HEADLINE> Milosevic Ally Killed in Shooting  </HEADLINE>
By MISHA SAVIC
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- A top official of Slobodan
Milosevic's ruling party was killed Saturday when an assailant shot
him in the head at a fair -- the latest in a series of
assassinations of prominent figures in Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Bosko Perosevic was touring the agricultural fair in the
northern city of Novi Sad, 45 miles northwest of Belgrade. Around
noon, he stepped away from his delegation of government officials
to answer his mobile phone, Belgrade-based Studio B Television
reported. A security guard approached him, pressed a gun to his
head and pulled the trigger, reporters who were at the scene said.
</P>
<P>
   Perosevic was rushed to Novi Sad's main hospital. Djordje
Janjic, the head of the hospital, said he died there Saturday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Perosevic was the chief of Milosevic's Socialist party in Novi
Sad and the head of regional government for the northern Vojvodina
province.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses at the scene said the gunman, identified by them and
reporters as 50-year-old Milivoj Gutovic, had worked at the
exhibition area for years. They said police arrested him after a
brief chase.
</P>
<P>
   Perosevic's killing was the latest in a series of high-profile
assassinations of government officials, top businessmen and
underworld figures, including the general manager of the Yugoslav
national airline, the country's defense minister and its top
paramilitary and mob leader. All have been gunned down in recent
months in Serbia, the larger republic in the Yugoslav federation.
</P>
<P>
   The violence has come amid rising political tensions and
allegations by the state that Milosevic's Western foes and
opponents at home are behind the killings -- a possible overture to
a brutal crackdown on the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, the Socialist Party quickly claimed a link between
the shooting, the opposition and the Western nations that last year
led the 78-day bombing campaign to make him relinquish control over
southern Kosovo province. A statement from the Socialists accused
the Serbian ''traitor'' opposition and popular student group Otpor,
or Resistance, of being behind the attack.
</P>
<P>
   ''The crime today clearly shows that those who made a brutal
aggression on Yugoslavia, now put their weapons in the hands of
their servants here,'' the statement said. It pledged to ''fight
back the terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
   Investigations in previous cases have not been conclusive, and
this is the first time the alleged attacker has been apprehended on
the spot. The early reports made it unclear whether the killing was
politically motivated: Studio B said the attacker had known
Perosevic for years, and that both were born and raised in the same
town.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Perosevic was killed on May 13, a communist-style
''Security Day'' anniversary that regularly praises Serbian police
for their efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   Also Saturday, opposition leader Vuk Draskovic accused the
regime of ''terror'' against opponents whose ''sacred duty is to
chase away the occupier (Milosevic) and free Serbia.''
</P>
<P>
   He spoke at a rally in central Serbia that commemorated Serbia's
World War II anti-fascist and anti-communist commander, Gen. Draza
Mihajlovic, killed in 1945 by rival communist guerrillas. Milosevic
rose to power through the once-dominant Communist Party, later
renamed Socialist.
</P>
<P>
   The memorial drew more than 10,000 people, some of whom fired
shots in the air. Draskovic told them to stop the fire and ''save
the ammunition.''

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Opposition Plan Strikes  </HEADLINE>
By ANGUS SHAW
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) -- Zimbabwe's main opposition party said
Saturday it is organizing a campaign of strikes and civil
disobedience to force the government to stop political violence by
ruling party militants.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need to embark on mass action to bring the government to
its senses,'' said Morgan Tsvangirai, leader of the Movement for
Democratic Change. He spoke about the plans to ask labor groups to
prepare for the campaign following an emergency meeting of party
officials.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Saturday, war veterans and militants of the ruling party
armed with clubs and iron bars broke up a peace rally called by the
National Constitutional Assembly, an alliance of civic groups.
</P>
<P>
   The rally was aimed to protest worsening political violence over
land that has left at least 18 opposition supporters dead --
including three white farmers. War veterans and violent squatters
have been illegally occupying more than 1,000 white-owned farms for
months, saying the land disparity between whites and blacks is
unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   Scores of police, some in riot gear, watched passively as
militants chased at least 100 people away from a sports arena in
western Harare. Others approaching were turned away by armed
militants.
</P>
<P>
   National Constitutional Assembly spokesman Tendai Biti said the
alliance had received police permission to hold the rally.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is our constitutional right to meet,'' Biti said. The
ruling Zimbabwe African National Union Patriotic Front ''forced our
people to disperse. They are the sponsors of violence.''
</P>
<P>
   At a memorial service at a Harare church, about 1,000 mourners
paid tribute to white farmer Alan Dunn, an opposition supporter who
was beaten to death May 7. Dunn's attackers are allegedly linked to
war veterans and squatters.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the deaths, opposition party officials reported more
than 5,000 incidents of ''state sponsored violence'' since
February, Tsvangirai said. The reported incidents include assaults,
rapes, intimidation and the destruction of homes.
</P>
<P>
   ''The government's strategy has been to completely undermine law
and order'' to instill fear in the electorate ahead of elections
expected to be called next month, he said.
</P>
<P>
   President Robert Mugabe's ruling party organized and financed
the farm occupations to create fear in country districts backing
the opposition that once were Mugabe's traditional stronghold,
Tsvangirai said.
</P>
<P>
   He said some veterans of the war that ended white rule in 1980
were being used to stir up violence and to ''promote the ruling
party's desperate attempts to hold onto power,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   ''It will not surprise us if one or two of our candidates are
killed'' in election campaigning, he said. ''No one is safe in this
society.''
</P>
<P>
   Also Saturday, the state controlled Herald newspaper quoted the
country's Citizenship Office as saying that whites who never
formally renounced their British citizenship were not considered
true Zimbabweans and should surrender their Zimbabwe passports.
</P>
<P>
   Zimbabwe banned dual citizenship in 1984. Britain, however,
allowed Zimbabweans of British descent to keep their British
passports. That right could only be officially renounced at a sworn
ceremony before British officials, a step few whites took.
</P>
<P>
   The farm occupations began in February, when the government lost
a constitutional referendum that would have entrenched Mugabe's
powers and allowed the government to seize white farms without
paying compensation. Mugabe says the land seizures are acceptable
in a country where one-third of the fertile land is owned by a few
thousand whites.

<HEADLINE> Cleric's Son Hurt in Chechnya Blast  </HEADLINE>
By YURI BAGROV
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAZRAN, Russia (AP) -- A remote-controlled bomb exploded on the
side of a highway in western Chechnya, injuring the son of a
pro-Moscow Muslim cleric as he sped in his car along a highway,
officials said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Ramzan Kadyrov suffered shrapnel wounds in Friday's explosion
near the city of Gudermes, officials said. His father -- Mufti
Akhmad Alidkhadzhi Kadyrov -- has been linked to efforts to create a
pro-Moscow administration in the southern, breakaway region.
</P>
<P>
   The elder Kadyrov said the explosion was the work of ''the
enemies of a peaceful solution to the conflict in Chechnya,'' the
Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   Russian troops are trying to subdue Chechen guerrillas fighting
for independence. Russia, which lost control of Chechnya in a
1994-96 war, retook most of the republic after invading in
September. But President Vladimir Putin has said it could be 18
months or more before there are local elections.
</P>
<P>
   Kadyrov, who enjoys good relations with Moscow, has been the
target of several assassination attempts, which have killed six of
his relatives, Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
   The rebel government dismissed Kadyrov last year as Chechnya's
top mufti, or religious judge and leader, after he met with Putin,
who was then prime minister. Rebel leaders called the meeting a
betrayal.
</P>
<P>
   Security was tight Saturday on the border between Chechnya and
the neighboring region of Ingushetia, where Chechen rebels ambushed
a Russian column on Thursday, killing 18 soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Guards at the Kavkaz checkpoint on the Chechen side of the
border took up to an hour to inspect each car, and reconnaissance
planes flew over the stretch of road where the column had been
attacked.
</P>
<P>
   Russian military officials and Ingushetia's president, Ruslan
Aushev, blamed each other for the attack, for which Chechen
fighters apparently had slipped into Ingushetia to ambush the
troops.
</P>
<P>
   Chechen guerrillas have shown they can move through the region's
forests and ravines to attack Russian positions, despite Moscow's
claims that its forces have crushed most organized resistance.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile Saturday, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported that
Ingush authorities had arrested Chechen field commander Lechi
Shavayev, who allegedly organized the 1988 kidnapping of Russia's
presidential envoy to Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   The envoy, Valentin Vlasov, was released after negotiations
between Chechen rebels and Interior Ministry officials. He spent
six months in captivity.
</P>
<P>
   Interfax also said that 19 rebels had been released from Russian
detainment under an amnesty law, which says militants who surrender
their weapons and are found to have committed no serious crimes can
go free.

<HEADLINE> Farm land sits on reservation because of 1983 congressional vote  </HEADLINE>
nghfcfls
<TEXT>
<P>
   LEDYARD, Conn. (AP) -- The landscape of Ledyard Farms has a
less-than-rural backdrop-- the sprawling Foxwoods Casino complex.
</P>
<P>
   When Congress conferred federal recognition on the Mashantucket
Pequot Indians in 1983, it set boundaries for the reservation. In
doing so, the government put some 100 acres of the 275-acre farm,
owned by Clifford and Mary Allyn within the boundaries for a
possible tribal reservation. The farmland is not officially part of
the current reservation.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past two decades, the tribe has tried several times to
buy the property, with offers that have increased to more than $10
million. But Clifford Allyn just keeps turning them down, and
planting his crops, and milking his cows.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not real smart, but I do have a little bit of common
sense,'' he said. ''There's a time to do things, like cutting trees
or picking tomatoes or anything else. You've got to pick 'em when
they're ripe.''
</P>
<P>
   Clifford Allyn compares the 1983 congressional action to a local
zone change where affected property owners voice their opinions at
public hearings. The difference, he says, is Congress didn't give
him that opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ''This wasn't really a zoning change. This was a little bit
bigger than that,'' he said. ''These people on the reservation, if
there was wrongdoings, I don't blame them. I blame the congressmen,
the people in Washington. ... The people who are supposed to be our
overseers didn't oversee.''
</P>
<P>
   That is also one of the conclusions of a new book, ''Without
Reservation: The Making of America's Most Powerful Indian Tribe and
Foxwoods, the World's Largest Casino,'' in which Jeff Benedict
writes that Congress was duped into bestowing tribal status on the
Mashantucket Pequots.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Sam Gejdenson, D-Conn., whose district includes the
Mashantucket reservation, and other members of Connecticut's
congressional delegation did not check whether the tribe had Pequot
lineage or what property was included in the proposed reservation
area, according to the book.
</P>
<P>
   The purpose of the congressional legislation was to settle a
lawsuit filed by the Mashantuckets to reclaim 800 acres that they
said had been taken from them illegally. But the reservation
boundaries approved by Congress went far beyond the land claims,
meaning the property would become part of the reservation if the
tribe bought it and the federal government placed it into trust for
the tribe.
</P>
<P>
   Benedict said the only Indian bloodline he could find among
Mashantucket tribal members was a faint connection to the
Narragansetts of Rhode Island.
</P>
<P>
   Tribal Council Chairman Kenneth Reels has said the tribal
council is discussing how to respond to the book, but would not
elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are a proud people, and we will not stand by and cater to
anyone who may be racist or jealous of our hard work and success,''
Reels said in a letter last week to tribal members.
</P>
<P>
   Congress recognized the Mashantuckets over the objection of the
Bureau of Indian Affairs, the agency that normally investigates and
rules on tribal recognition petitions. Federal recognition entitles
tribes to federal benefits and to negotiate with states to build
casinos.

<HEADLINE> N.M. Evacuees Begin Returning Home  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN MacDONALD
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ALAMOS, N.M. (AP) -- Randy Foster tossed an armload of
clothes in his truck, grabbed his dog and fled as the town around
him was about to burn. He left behind his new motorcycle as hot ash
began singeing the back of his neck.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was time to go,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, the Los Alamos police officer returned for the
first time to what remained of his neighborhood. Walking through
his yard in blue jeans soiled with ash and soot, he found the
artifacts of a life lost: charred metal, blackened rubble and the
skeleton of his bike, most of it melted away in an inferno that has
turned 36,000 acres of northern New Mexico into a scorched no man's
land.
</P>
<P>
   Most frustrating was what Foster could no longer identify.
</P>
<P>
   He turned over a hunk of fused metal in his hands, blackened by
picking through the debris that was once his living room.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have no idea what this is,'' he said. Then, after a pause,
it came to him. ''Oh, wait a minute, that's my VCR.''
</P>
<P>
   More than a week after the National Park Service started the
blaze to remove dry brush and grass, the fire that had destroyed
260 homes and threatened the Los Alamos National Laboratory no
longer looked invincible, and Los Alamos began to come to grips
with the scale of its destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the 25,000 people evacuated will not be allowed to
return to their homes for at least a week, although the National
Guard will begin escorting groups into Los Alamos as early as
Sunday to pick up clothes, medicine and other essentials. Most
learned of their homes' fate only Friday, when a list of destroyed
houses was posted on the county Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt has promised residents they
will have answers by Thursday about why the National Park Service
started the blaze at Bandelier National Monument. Park
Superintendent Roy Weaver was placed on paid leave pending an
investigation, and Babbitt said all prescribed fires in the West
would be put on hold for a month, although government agencies
could still grant exceptions.
</P>
<P>
   At a Red Cross shelter in Santa Fe, residents waited for word of
the supervised visits, trying to determine in the meantime what
remained.
</P>
<P>
   A few made their way into town, past the checkpoints meant to
keep them out. Others like Foster, whose jobs gave them access,
trickled in to survey the devastation, which could cost $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   White ash dusted the remnants of his two-story condominium like
a light spring snow, and the twisted metal resembled a junkyard
more than the wreckage of a home.
</P>
<P>
   Foster said working 12-hour shifts helped him keep his mind off
the loss but he was still bitter over how feeble he felt in the
face of a fire that seemed relentless.
</P>
<P>
   Faring better was the Los Alamos National Laboratory, a key
facility in the nation's nuclear weapons program that gave rise to
the town.
</P>
<P>
   Some trailers were burned, but the lab's major facilities
emerged unscathed. The lab planned to resume limited operations
Monday, lab Director John Browne said.
</P>
<P>
   The fire in the nearby canyons and valleys was still only 5
percent contained, but temperatures that dropped to 35 degrees and
calm winds allowed emergency crews to bring airplanes, helicopters
and bulldozers into the attempt to finally subdue the blaze. The
fire spread little overnight, although a shroud of smoke blanketing
the valley Saturday forced policemen and relief workers to wear
protective masks.
</P>
<P>
   Months of drought in New Mexico have left the state vulnerable
to outbreaks like the Los Alamos fire. Though the fire season has
just begun, already more than 200,000 acres have burned -- nearly
four times the total for all of last year.
</P>
<P>
   In southern New Mexico, a fire caused by a downed power line
that had charred 20,700 acres lost momentum, and firefighters said
it was 50 percent contained. The fire destroyed 14 buildings and
forced 125 people from their homes in the Sacramento Mountains. The
villages of Sacramento and Weed were evacuated, along with several
nearby canyon enclaves.
</P>
<P>
   About 450 firefighters were using bulldozers, airplanes and a
helicopter to fight that blaze Saturday.

<HEADLINE> No Talks Set on Gun Control Bills  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Gun control legislation is stalled in Congress
and prospects for action appear dim in an election year.
</P>
<P>
   While another shooting tragedy could spur action, the National
Rifle Association's influence has won out so far. Organizers of
Sunday's ''Million Mom March'' plan to transform their movement
into a political operation to compete with the NRA -- not
financially, but by using the Internet to stay connected and
convince supporters to vote for candidates who back gun control.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate approved several measures a year ago, including a
requirement that weapons have child safety locks. The Senate also
would require a three-day waiting period before a sale by an
unlicensed gun seller at a gun show. The same time frame is
currently required for licensed dealer sales at shows and in
stores.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate also approved language that would ban the importation
of large-capacity ammunition clips; ban possession of firearms by
those convicted of committing violent crimes as juveniles, and
prohibit juveniles from acquiring assault weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The House rejected any new controls and there are no scheduled
meetings between House and Senate conferees.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration strongly supports the safety locks
and waiting period language and has criticized the failure of
conferees to meet to fashion a compromise.
</P>
<P>
   The NRA and its supporters argue there are plenty of gun
regulations now but the administration has not been enforcing them.
</P>
<P>
   The ''Million Mom March'' organizers want further restrictions
beyond the Senate-approved measures. Chief among them is the
registration of all handguns and a license for their owners.
</P>
<P>
   The licensing system would require purchasers to receive basic
safety training and is designed to prevent sales to criminals,
children or disturbed individuals. Guns would be registered after
sellers checked the buyer's license and then registered the gun's
serial number.

<HEADLINE> Clooney's 'ER' Return Surprised NBC  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- ''ER'' fans weren't the only ones stunned by
George Clooney's reappearance on the show.
</P>
<P>
   Even top-ranking NBC executives didn't know Clooney's character,
Dr. Doug Ross, would be showing up to sweep nurse Carol Hathaway
off her feet in Thursday's episode.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Times reported in Saturday's editions that
''ER'' executive producer John Wells was desperate to keep the
moment secret -- desperate enough to promise bonuses to crew members
for keeping quiet, excise the scene from the script presented to
NBC, and even hide the footage in his refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
   ''John gave everyone checks and said, 'If no one finds out,
these checks are good,''' Clooney said in an interview from the
Cannes Film Festival.
</P>
<P>
   TV producers are increasingly frustrated with network executives
who give away their shows' best moments in promos designed to lure
viewers.
</P>
<P>
   For once, Wells wanted to give fans a real surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's so difficult to keep anything quiet anymore,'' Wells
said.

<P>
   CINCINNATI (AP) -- What's said during a presidential election
year can seem like something from a horror movie, if you listen to
the first man to walk on the moon.
</P>
<P>
   ''Election rhetoric oozes under the door, settles over transoms
and radiates through solid walls,'' Neil Armstrong said in a rare
public speaking appearance.
</P>
<P>
   ''But if you can withstand it for six months, it will disappear

   The 69-year-old Armstrong didn't mention his famous 1969
moonwalk during a commencement address to 214 graduates of the

economic prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong said that neither Democrats nor Republicans are
responsible for the United State's current economic success.

<P>
   ''The reality is that neither of them have much to do with the

<HEADLINE> Protesters Back Jailed Kosovo Serbs  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KOSOVSKA MITROVICA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Thousands of relatives and
supporters of imprisoned Kosovo Serbs held a march Saturday to
demand speedy trials and freedom for inmates at the NATO-run jail
here.
</P>
<P>
   The protest was in Kosovska Mitrovica, the northern Kosovo city
which has the largest Serb population in the province. Thirty-seven
Serbs and five Roma, or Gypsies, have been held in detention here
for months, charged with a variety of offenses ranging from war
crimes to common criminal acts.
</P>
<P>
   Their trials have been delayed because Kosovo has lacked a
functioning judicial system since NATO peacekeepers and U.N.
officials assumed control of the province.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a situation of a complete legal insecurity. This is
terror that cannot be tolerated,'' said Jovan Dinkic, a
representative of the local Serb community.
</P>
<P>
   Detainees went on a hunger strike last month to protest the
delay in their trials. About two dozen wives and mothers of
detained Serbs also have started a hunger strike in a show of
solidarity.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the inmates, whose health is said to have deteriorated,
have now been transferred to a local hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs are also angry over what they perceive as U.N. and
NATO authorities' preferential treatment of ethnic Albanian
suspects. They claim their ethnic Albanian counterparts are rarely
kept in detention even if they are suspected of committing crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to the nearly daily protests by Kosovo Serbs, U.N.
administrators on Friday pledged to start holding trials by next
month, despite a lack of personnel or an adequate legal framework.
Serbs have rejected U.N. offers to take part in multiethnic courts.
</P>
<P>
   Dinkic said that since Kosovo officially remains part of Serbia
under a U.N. resolution, the trials should be held according to the
laws of Serbia and the Yugoslav federation, in which Serbia is the
dominant republic.

<HEADLINE> Jury Awards Top Ore. Ballot Issues  </HEADLINE>
By BRAD CAIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALEM, Ore. (AP) -- Linda McCathern was left a quadriplegic,
unable to hug her young daughter and requiring around-the-clock
medical care, by an accident involving a sport utility vehicle in
1995.
</P>
<P>
   A jury determined the Toyota 4-Runner had a faulty design and
awarded her $7.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   Now, McCathern is appalled that Oregon voters are being asked to
limit such awards.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's irresponsible,'' McCathern, 41, said of a measure being
decided in Tuesday's primary election that would let the state
Legislature set limits on the amount of money juries may award in
personal-injury lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   ''Companies should be punished for the faulty products they
produce,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Many doctors disagree. They restrictions on jury awards are
needed to hold down the costs of malpractice insurance for doctors
and insurance coverage for all Oregonians.
</P>
<P>
   Measure 81, known as the ''pain and suffering'' meaure, is one
of six measures on the ballot in the nation's first regular primary
election conducted exclusively by mail. Oregon voters decided two
years ago to abolish the traditional polling place election in
favor of holding all future elections by mail.
</P>
<P>
   The ballots must be returned by Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The primary includes contests for secretary of state, state
treasurer, state attorney general, the U.S. House and legislative
seats. George W. Bush and Alan Keyes are listed in the presidential
race for the Republicans, and Al Gore and perennial candidate
Lyndon LaRouche are listed for the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   But the real heat is being generated by Measure 81.
</P>
<P>
   The proposition has become a high-stakes battle pitting business
and medical groups who want to limit damages against trial lawyers
and others who want juries to decide damages for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents scored a public relations coup when they persuaded
Erin Brockovich to appear, for free, in their television
commercials. The California legal investigator, portrayed by Julia
Roberts in the recent movie ''Erin Brockovich,'' bluntly tells
viewers that letting politicians decide how to run the courts ''is
a crime.''
</P>
<P>
   The president of the Oregon Medical Association, Dr. Richard
Kincade, remembers that during the 1980s some doctors refused to
deliver babies because of the skyrocketing cost of malpractice
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   ''If Measure 81 doesn't pass, there will be no mechanism to get
control over those large jury awards,'' Kincade says. ''Ultimately,
the consumer will end up paying for the increase in insurance
premium rates.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kristi Schaefer, a registered nurse who has worked with
brain injury patients for 23 years, says it's wrong to limit how
much a person can be awarded for being injured as a result of a
shoddy product or someone else's negligence.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some of the people I work with can't brush their teeth; they
don't know their children's names; they get lost going to the
mailbox,'' Schaefer says. ''For many survivors, functioning from
day to day is nearly insurmountable.''

<HEADLINE> Hearse Tours Planned in Salem, Mass.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALEM, Mass. (AP) -- In a city that's made money capitalizing on
the murderous hysteria of its infamous witch trials, a proposal to
give tourists tours by hearse of gory landmarks is meeting heavy
resistance.
</P>
<P>
   The Mass Hysteria Haunted Hearse tour would highlight macabre
events in Salem from the time of the witch trials to the present,
including some recent murders.
</P>
<P>
   City councilors say it goes way too far.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not going to tell you this promotes a positive image of
the city,'' said Councilor Kim Driscoll.
</P>
<P>
   ''People say tourism is the answer here,'' Councilor Regina
Flynn told The Salem Evening News. ''On the other hand, it's what
kind of tourism do you want?''
</P>
<P>
   The council has refused to grant Douglas Antreassian a license
to run the tour, saying his application had several flaws that had
nothing to do with whether or not they liked his idea. Those flaws
included the lack of a permanent office or adequate space to park
the hearse.
</P>
<P>
   But Antreassian has decided he doesn't need a city permit and
plans to open for business June 1. He says the tour is educational
and maintains he has a First Amendment right to show even offensive
sites.
</P>
<P>
   Antreassian's attorney, Edward Dailey, said the council has
overstepped its bounds.
</P>
<P>
   ''Whether the City Council likes it or not, the City Council has
no right whatsoever to censor the script that these people are
using,'' Dailey said

<HEADLINE> Gunmen Free 150 Brazil Jail Inmates  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) -- Eight heavily armed men stormed a jail
in South America's most populous city Saturday and freed nearly 150
inmates, police said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The gunmen barged in firing machine guns and revolvers,'' said
Domingos Paulo Neto, head of the police precinct in Cidade Dutra, a
low-income district on the outskirts of Sao Paulo, where about 16
million people live.
</P>
<P>
   A police officer was wounded in both legs and a prison guard was
hit in the head with a pistol, Paulo Neto said.
</P>
<P>
   Paulo Neto said the gunmen freed 144 inmates, 19 of whom have
been recaptured. Eight prisoners in a maximum security cell were
the only ones who did not escape.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the prisoners were being held on charges of robbery and
drug trafficking. Others were charged with rape and murder.

<HEADLINE> AM-NJ--School Construction, Bjt,1020  </HEADLINE>
By KATHLEEN CANNON
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J.(AP) -- Irvington kindergarten teacher Consuelo
Knnerly considers her cramped classroom a mixed blessing.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is an upgrade. I used to teach in the cafeteria,'' said
Knnerly, who teaches English as a second language.
</P>
<P>
   Her classroom is in the basement of the 100-year-old Grove
Street School and has two windows; only one opens. Books and files
are piled precariously because there is no storage space. Dim
lights hang from the antique tin ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the shabby surroundings, her children are well-behaved
and busy reading text books.
</P>
<P>
   The scene is similar about 120 miles away in the southwestern
corner of the state.
</P>
<P>
   At the Oak and Main School, a 90-year-old red brick building in
Vineland, teachers accompany kindergartners down a steep flight of
stairs to the basement, to the only bathrooms in the building.
</P>
<P>
   There is no cafeteria, no multi-purpose room, no indoor
recreation space. When weather is bad during recess, teachers roll
a television with a video cassette recorder from room to room to
allow children to watch a movie.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is make-do,'' said architect Larry Merighi, who is
contracted by Vineland schools.
</P>
<P>
   Irvington and Vineland are special needs school districts, two
of 30 in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   The districts are in line for hundreds of millions of dollars to
improve, expand or replace outmoded and overcrowded school
buildings -- once the Legislation passes the school construction
bill.
</P>
<P>
   The bill is an outgrowth of a May 1998 state Supreme Court
ruling that most believe ordered the state to provide 100 percent
funding to improve crumbling school facilities in the special needs
districts.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, the measure, which also includes money for more
affluent suburban districts, is crawling through the Legislature.
Two versions, with substantial differences, are pending in the
Assembly and Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Various price tags have been affixed to the bills. Last week,
state education officials estimated the program will cost $5
billion in the special needs districts and another $5.4 billion for
the others.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate bill, scheduled for a final vote Thursday, covers 100
percent of the costs in the special needs districts.
</P>
<P>
   But the version advanced by Assembly Speaker Jack Collins
proposes full funding only for emergency repairs and new classrooms
to relieve overcrowding. State money for ''extras'' such as
cafeterias and media rooms would be provided on a sliding scale,
depending on a district's ability to pay.
</P>
<P>
   Legislative leaders insist they'll craft a compromise in time to
meet the court's spring 2000 deadline to supply the money for
construction this summer.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Irvington School Business Administrator Michael
G. Steele, who oversees 12 schools with an enrollment of 8,000
pupils, is trying to stretch his limited funds. The school district
estimates it needs about $172 million to upgrade facilities to meet
court requirements.
</P>
<P>
   ''We know the quirks and the limits of the buildings, and we
know what is in the budget. Then something happens like a boiler
breaks. It's very difficult planning,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Because of the politics, the longer is takes, the more
expensive it becomes,'' Steele said.
</P>
<P>
   Across town, at Irvington's University Six elementary school,
hallways are grimy, windows in the stairwells are cracked and water
fountains are unsanitary
</P>
<P>
   Only three of the district's school builders are outfitted with
computers because wiring in the other schools is inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   The picture in Vineland is also grim. A booming enrollment
fueled by new families buying up cheap land is straining the
Cumberland County district's resources.
</P>
<P>
   The district is growing so fast, it still relies on trailers
housing temporary classrooms even after building an 18-room
addition to the Vineland Middle School.
</P>
<P>
   Superintendent Gerald Kohn estimates it will cost $234 million
to finish the job district-wide and upgrade or replace the 12
schools whose total enrollment of 9,400 students grows every year.
</P>
<P>
   Kohn is frustrated with the Legislature and the state Department
of Education. Lawmakers have procrastinated over the financial
solution, while the bureaucrats have nit-picked over interim
stopgap measures to help the schools, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's been a huge struggle for all 30 districts,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the department forbade the district from using
state aid to finish a school expansion project to accommodate
full-day kindergarten in the city's Johnstone School -- a Supreme
Court requirement. As a result, the classrooms are finished, but
the school is still served by one six-burner stove in the
cafeteria, and rainy days turn the unfinished playground into a
muddy pit.
</P>
<P>
   ''How much begging, cajoling and table beating do we have to do
to get the state to release funding for provide full-day
kindergarten?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Kohn nor Steele believe local taxpayers can help pay the
bill for districts' mounting needs, as proposed by Speaker Collins.
</P>
<P>
   Kohn said Vineland voters haven't approved a bond referendum
since the late 1970s, when they voted to replace a school destroyed
by a fire.
</P>
<P>
   ''Vineland has an overtaxed population,'' he said. ''People
cannot afford to have any tax increase.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's why Collins is wrong,'' he said. ''Not only does his
proposal violate the court opinion, he'd put the burden on families
and voters who can least afford it.''
</P>
<P>
   Steele, a former township school board member and mayor, has
followed the school funding court case through its 25-year history.
</P>
<P>
   He sympathizes with Collins' position that some special needs
districts may be able to pay for their own improvements.
</P>
<P>
   ''To overburden the taxpayer is not fair. But if a community can
do it, I probably agree with Collins,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But he said his district does not fall in that category. ''We're
tapped out. Between the school and the town, we're above our debt
limit.''

<HEADLINE> Farm Service Agency Faces New Suit  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSON, Miss. (AP) -- A group of 112 farmers has filed a lawsuit
alleging they have been treated unfairly by the same federal agency
that was sued by black farmers claiming decades of racial
discrimination in federal lending practices.
</P>
<P>
   The black farmers won a $2.2 billion settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyer Jimmy Robertson, who filed the latest lawsuit on Friday
against the Farm Service Agency, said his clients lost farms
because of credit denial, prejudicial delays in receiving credits,
insufficient loan amounts and unreasonable collateral requirements.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe that all farmers getting loans from Farm Service
Agency, the last resort, are in the same economic category,''
Robertson said. ''It is not as much about race as it is equal
treatment of two groups of small farmers in the same economic
group.''
</P>
<P>
   Robertson said the suit also has plaintiffs from Montana and
Louisiana. He did not return calls for additional comment Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the Jackson Farm Service office said Friday they
had not received the suit and would not comment.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit has support from Rep. Benny Thompson, D-Miss., whose
district includes parts of the Mississippi Delta.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have talked to some of the plaintiffs and can see little
difference in the way black farmers were treated ... and what has
happened to the farmers in this suit,'' Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement in the lawsuit by black farmers offered cash
payments, debt forgiveness, termination of foreclosure and one-time
priority loan consideration.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, 213 Indian farmers and ranchers filed a similar
lawsuit alleging discrimination in the granting of loans. They
sought $19 billion in damages -- $1 million for each of the 19,000
Indians.

<HEADLINE> Mayor: Name Street for Hemings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. (AP) -- The mayor says the time has come to
rename a city street in honor of the family that included Sally
Hemings, Thomas Jefferson's slave and alleged lover.
</P>
<P>
   In an e-mail to city officials this week, Mayor Virginia
Daugherty wrote that Hemings family members, ''deserve to be
remembered for their roles both at Monticello and in
Charlottesville.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The name Hemings Street would be a fitting tribute.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, a panel of scholars commissioned by the
Thomas Jefferson Memorial Foundation, which owns and operates
Monticello, concluded that the third president probably fathered at
least one of Sally Hemings' seven children.
</P>
<P>
   But the descendants of Jefferson and his wife, Martha, have not
yet acknowledged Hemings' descendants or admitted them to the
Monticello Association, which maintains the family graveyard at
Monticello.
</P>
<P>
   Residents of the predominately black Fifeville neighborhood
welcomed the move.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel that it's about time for them to have done something
for people who were enslaved,'' C.B. Lewis said. ''Black people
have done a lot that we don't get any credit for.''

<HEADLINE> Jackson State Shootings Recalled  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL PAYNE
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSON, Miss. (AP) -- Time has claimed much of the anger and
terror of the night 30 years ago when nightly clashes between white
motorists and black students on campus ended in a barrage of police
gunfire that left two young people dead at historically black
Jackson State University.
</P>
<P>
   Today, only the bullet-scarred walls of Alexander Hall still
attest to the violence that forced Mississippi to look at race
relations and at the way its police respond.
</P>
<P>
   May 14, 1970, marked the tragic climax of a week of
demonstrations and nightly clashes between students and white
motorists harassing them along Lynch Street, a busy thoroughfare
that cut through the then-3,500-student campus.
</P>
<P>
   The student protests had started over the Jackson Police
Department's refusal to shut down the street.
</P>
<P>
   That night, when students refused to disburse, a police
fusillade set off by the sound of a bottle breaking killed Phillip
L. Gibbs, a 21-year-old Jackson State student, and James Earl
Green, a 17-year-old passerby. Both victims were black.
</P>
<P>
   Ten days earlier, four white students had been killed when the
National Guard opened fire on anti-Vietnam protesters at Ohio's
Kent State University.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can still recall the awful screaming and yelling and the
gunfire,'' said Jack Hobbs, a television reporter who filmed the
shooting at Jackson State. ''It was deafening. I thought 'Oh my
God, they're shooting these kids.'''
</P>
<P>
   Like their northern, white counterparts, many of the Jackson
State students were angry about the Vietnam War, but in a Southern
city divided by a long and bitter civil rights struggle, the unrest
was more about simmering racial tension.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson State instructor Gene Young witnessed the shooting as a
19-year-old sophomore and traveled to Kent State on May 4 for a
service to remember the victims of both tragedies.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's therapeutic to meet with other people coming to terms
with conflict,'' Young said. ''Students on other campuses suffered
great losses also.''
</P>
<P>
   Young said he hopes Jackson State will do a better job of
educating a new generation about the shootings. Thousands turned
out for ceremonies at Kent State, but fewer than 50 attended a
candlelit vigil at Jackson State.
</P>
<P>
   Students living in Alexander Hall today admit they know little
about the shooting that made national headlines and history books.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think some police shot some guys and they had a riot about
it,'' said junior Erica Wilson, 20. ''That's all I know about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bert Case, who along with Hobbs had been covering the protests,
said a standoff developed when police and the Mississippi Highway
Patrol demanded the students disperse after a city dump truck was
set ablaze near campus.
</P>
<P>
   When a wine bottle shattered near Case's feet, lawmen apparently
mistook the noise for gunfire and began firing in the direction of
the dormitory.
</P>
<P>
   ''Right after that bottle broke they unleashed a 29-second
fusillade, firing shotguns,'' Case said.
</P>
<P>
   ''They just panned down the side of the dormitory,'' he said.
''It was like a war zone.''
</P>
<P>
   Police and the Highway Patrol would later defend their action,
which riddled the dormitory with 275 bullet holes, with claims of a
dormitory sniper, which were never substantiated.
</P>
<P>
   A dozen injured students were transported to a hospital within
20 minutes of the incident. A federal investigation later revealed
that ambulances were not called until after the officers had picked
up their shell casings.
</P>
<P>
   Then-university president John Peoples heard news of the
shooting from National Guardsmen who arrived at his on-campus house
with fixed bayonets shortly afterward. He said students took him to
the dormitory where ''blood was running down the stairway.''
</P>
<P>
   James Earl Green's younger sister, Gloria Green McCray, now 46,
went to Kent State this year to bring closure to her brother's
death.
</P>
<P>
   Vivid memories of distant gunfire, chaos and waiting in vain for
her brother still haunt McCray.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, she earned a degree at the university -- the first in
her family.
</P>
<P>
   ''I always felt I lost something at Jackson State which could
never be returned,'' McCray said. ''But I gained something which
can never be taken away.''

<HEADLINE> Israel, Palestinians Miss Deadline  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE COPANS
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israeli soldiers clashed with Palestinian
protesters for the second day in a row Saturday as Palestinian
leaders accused Israel of causing peace negotiators to miss another
deadline for the outlines of a final treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Demonstrations demanding the release of some 1,600 Palestinians
held in Israeli jails were slated to continue Sunday, even as
negotiators were scheduled to meet in Jerusalem in an effort to
discuss the issue.
</P>
<P>
   In the West Bank town of Tulkarem, about 300 Palestinians
demanding the release of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel threw
stones at an Israeli army checkpoint. Soldiers responded with tear
gas and rubber-coated steel bullets. Hospital officials said about
40 Palestinians were injured, some from gunshot wounds.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli army denied using lethal force in any of the
disturbances Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   In Hebron, Israeli soldiers shot rubber bullets and tear gas at
dozens of Palestinians who burned Israeli and American flags and
threw stones, slightly injuring eleven people, including a news
photographer.
</P>
<P>
   The fighting came as a deadline for a framework on a final peace
treaty passed with the sides still deeply divided over the
questions of final borders, the status of Jerusalem, return of
Palestinian refugees and the future of Jewish settlements.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak set the May 13 deadline after
the sides missed an initial mid-February target date. The missed
date could jeopardize the Sept. 13 deadline Barak and Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat have set for a full-fledged permanent
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The sides are waiting for U.S. Middle East peace envoy Dennis
Ross to return to the region on Monday. They hope his participation
in the next round of talks will help bring progress.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians want to establish a state in all the West Bank
and Gaza Strip while Israel reportedly hopes to annex at least 20
percent of those areas. Israel refuses to grant the Palestinians
sovereignty over any part of east Jerusalem, where the Palestinians
want to establish a capital. Arafat has said he will declare
statehood this year, even without an agreement with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Barak is having a tough time gaining approval in his coalition
for a key Palestinian demand in the talks -- that Israel transfer
Arab villages near Jerusalem to full Palestinian control in the
next withdrawal of Israeli control from areas in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Barak was holding talks with ministers from his One Israel party
Saturday night to discuss his coalition troubles. Three party
members have threatened to quit the government if the villages are
given to the Palestinians, Israel radio reported.
</P>
<P>
   To offset the threats, Barak is trying to garner support to
transfer the areas to the Palestinians from parties outside the
coalition. Due to the difficulties, Barak will probably not bring
the matter to a vote in a cabinet meeting Sunday as planned, the
radio station said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Will television viewers lose their
''Friends?''
</P>
<P>
   Cast members of the popular NBC sitcom have until noon Sunday to
resolve their salary dispute with Warner Bros., the studio that
produces the show, or get booted from the network's fall lineup.
</P>
<P>
   The six principal cast members have demanded $1 million per
episode.
</P>
<P>
   Warner Bros. would not comment Saturday, but reportedly has
offered each actor $800,000 per episode for 22 shows. NBC
spokeswoman Shirley Powell would not comment on the specifics of
the salary negotiations, but said the deadline applied to ''all
parties'' in the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ''Either 'Friends' will be in the lineup Monday or not,'' she
said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The network unveils its fall schedule Monday in New York.

<HEADLINE> Putin Creates Seven Districts  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- President Vladimir Putin issued a decree Saturday
dividing Russia into seven districts, each with its own Kremlin
representative -- an apparent effort to assert more central control
over the provinces.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's 89 provinces, some of which have been testing the
limits of autonomy since the 1991 Soviet collapse, will be grouped
under the new system, according to the decree. The move will help
''increase the effectiveness of the federal organs of power and
improve control over compliance with their decisions,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
   Kremlin officials could not be reached for comment and it wasn't
immediately clear how the new system would boost government
control.
</P>
<P>
   According to the decree, the Kremlin-appointed representatives
will help implement federal laws in the republics and report back
to Moscow. The federal government already has representatives in
each of Russia's regions, and the NTV television station said
Saturday that the appointments of those representatives from the
era of former President Boris Yeltsin were now invalid.
</P>
<P>
   Putin has made reclaiming Moscow's control over the provinces
one of his top priorities after years of growing autonomy. The new
president claims that a strong central authority is essential to
avoiding the breakup of the country.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, he ordered several regions to rescind legislation
that contradicted or defied federal laws.
</P>
<P>
   Putin's position contrasts with that taken by Yeltsin, who
allowed provincial governors wide powers.
</P>
<P>
   The seven districts will be headquartered in the cities of
Moscow, St. Petersburg, Rostov-on-Don, Nizhny Novgorod,
Yekaterinburg, Novosibirsk and Khabarovsk.

<HEADLINE> Researcher Contract Rare Infection  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT DETRICK, Md. (AP) -- A civilian researcher working for the
Army on a vaccine against a rare bacterial disease contracted the
illness after accidentally being exposed to bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   The civilian microbiologist, identified only as a man in his
mid-30s, was recently diagnosed with glanders, a bacterial
infection typically found in horses and donkeys, said Col. Gerald
W. Parker, commander of the Army Medical Research Institute of
Infectious diseases, where the exposure occurred.
</P>
<P>
   While the disease is almost always fatal if left untreated, the
microbiologist was taken to Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore and
was expected to make a full recovery.
</P>
<P>
   The researcher was working on a vaccine for glanders. He first
became ill in March, complaining of fever, malaise and weight loss.
He was admitted to nearby Frederick Memorial Hospital May 2 and
transferred to Johns Hopkins May 4.
</P>
<P>
   The disease in humans is virtually unknown in the U.S., but
appears periodically in South America, Africa and Asia. It was
allegedly used by the Japanese during World War II to infect
horses, civilians and prisoners of war.

<HEADLINE> Gov: Eliminate Teachers' Tax  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN HOWARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Gov. Gray Davis proposed eliminating
the state income tax for public-school teachers Saturday, a
dramatic move he said would reward teachers for ''investing their
lives in our children's future.''
</P>
<P>
   The plan, which requires approval of the Legislature, was
accompanied by a separate, $500 million teacher-incentive program
that offers cash bonuses of up to $5,000 to teachers whose students
perform well in the schools' new statewide testing program.
</P>
<P>
   Together, the proposals would cost about $3 billion over the
first three years, although the administration said that figure
could change with the fluctuation in teachers' pay.
</P>
<P>
   For teachers who itemize their deductions, the governor's income
tax plan would provide roughly a $500 tax break for entry level
teachers, and about a $1,350 break to teachers earning about
$50,000 annually. There are about 280,000 teachers in the state
eligible for the program.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic governor said the unprecedented tax break should
also apply to credentialed personnel in public schools such as
counselors, librarians, administrators and other employees.
</P>
<P>
   The governor said the plan, which would not cover private school
teachers, was made possible by California's booming economy. The
flood of tax receipts into state coffers has provided some $10
billion to $13 billion of new revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Davis' proposals, the latest in a series of education-related
programs released over the past few days, will be contained in his
revised, $88 billion state budget blueprint, to be released Monday.

<HEADLINE> Rainfall Hampers Soaked Mozambique  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) -- A week of unseasonable, heavy rainfall
in Mozambique has destroyed a key road used to deliver aid through
the southern African country, prompting officials to appeal for
more aircraft, a top relief official said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The rains interrupted traffic on a dirt road linking southern
and central Mozambique, Silvano Langa, director of the National
Disasters Management Institute. That road was being used to deliver
aid after parts of the main road were destroyed by floods in
February and March.
</P>
<P>
   Langa asked foreign donors to allow Mozambique to use eight
helicopters beyond Friday, when original agreements had them
retiring from the aid distribution operation. China agreed to make
two aircraft available for longer, Langa said.
</P>
<P>
   The renewed rains were also hindering flood victims trying to
resettle and build new homes, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The floods killed at least 700 people and destroyed the homes or
jobs of an estimated 2 million more.

<HEADLINE> Bush Addresses College Graduates  </HEADLINE>
By MARK BABINECK
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRAIRIE VIEW, Texas (AP) -- Gov. George W. Bush condemned bigotry
and the scholastic achievement gap between the nation's rich and
poor students in a commencement address Saturday at Prairie View
A&AMP;M University.
</P>
<P>
   ''Bigotry and intolerance are unworthy of our country, because
they go against our country's creed -- the worth of every person as
an individual,'' Bush told a crowd of about 4,000.
</P>
<P>
   ''The worth of an individual is measured by our hearts and our
souls and our potential. We are measured by how we live our lives
and how we treat others,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Only one graduate accepted his diploma without shaking Bush's
hand; a second danced across the stage and stuck his tongue out
toward Bush and the school's president, Charles A. Hines, though he
shook both men's hands.
</P>
<P>
   During his 20-minute speech, Bush received one of his warmest
responses when he cited his mother, former first lady Barbara Bush,
and religion.
</P>
<P>
   ''One of the things my mother has taught me is this: the value
of a strong and quiet faith,'' he said. ''God exists today, and God
will exist forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also mentioned ''empty seats'' at the ceremony, referring
to the six Prairie View students who died this semester, including
four killed when a van carrying members of the men's track team
crashed in East Texas. Two others died in shootings.
</P>
<P>
   ''You responded to great sorrow with courage and faith,'' said
Bush, whose father -- former President George Bush -- attended a
memorial for victims of the Feb. 10 van wreck that injured six
others. ''You comforted each other, and found the comfort that only
comes from a kind and merciful Lord.''
</P>
<P>
   Also Saturday, the senior Bush delivered a commencement speech
at Rice University in Houston.

<HEADLINE> Homeless From N.M. Fire Taken In  </HEADLINE>
By MICHELLE KOIDIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   OJO CALIENTE, N.M. (AP) -- Janice Fron and David Fricks had never
met before, but shortly after he arrived at her home, he was
sipping a beer and flipping TV channels from her couch.
</P>
<P>
   In the days since a wildfire raged through Los Alamos,
destroying 260 homes and forcing 25,000 residents from the homes at
least a week, dozens of people in nearby communities have opened
their doors to strangers.
</P>
<P>
   A few, like Fron, spread the invitation by word of mouth, often
though friends or volunteers working at the three American Red
Cross shelters. Others who had a spare bed to offer taped
handwritten notes to bulletin boards. Some said they could take in
a family; others said they would watch over dogs and cats, horses
and even goats.
</P>
<P>
   ''When people are in need, I wouldn't think of any less than
trying to help any way I can because, you know, the shoe can be on
the other foot,'' Fron, a 48-year-old receptionist, said after
Fricks showed up with his two dogs.
</P>
<P>
   While Fricks, 50, was showering at Fron's mobile home 28 miles
north of Los Alamos, hundreds of other evacuees streamed into the
shelters seeking food, toiletries and information.
</P>
<P>
   For those like Fricks, whose home is still intact, the situation
should be short-lived. But for those whose homes were in the 36,000
acres the wildfire has burned, help food and shelter may be needed
for months to come.
</P>
<P>
   So far, volunteers have donated so much food since Wednesday's
evacuations, the Red Cross and Gov. Gary Johnson have had to plead
with would-be donors to send checks instead.
</P>
<P>
   At one shelter, a converted bingo hall at an Indian casino in
nearby Pojoaque, the director loaded two tractor-trailers with food
and sent it to another shelter.
</P>
<P>
   Jugs of water and cardboard boxes filled with canned food were
stacked up outside the hall for lack of storage space. Inside,
mothers holding the hands of small children filed down a long row
of wooden tables stacked with peanut butter and jelly, tuna and
crackers.
</P>
<P>
   Some people brought in used paperback books and board games,
which were stacked on one of 50 cots set up in the noisy, crowded
room. One person dropped off a teddy bear with the words ''I love
you'' in a red heart on its chest.
</P>
<P>
   Volunteers have arrived by the dozens, as well, at least 100
from across New Mexico and 100 more from elsewhere, Red Cross
spokeswoman Kristin Warzocha said.
</P>
<P>
   Judy Spoonhoward, 40, of Santa Fe, said she opened her home to a
man from Los Alamos because she can understand how the evacuees
feel. When she was 8, her home in North Dakota burned down.
</P>
<P>
   ''I figured anything I could do would be worth it,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Rabbi could become first clergyman to face death penalty  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN P. McALPIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- For four years her death was a mystery. Now
the killing of a rabbi's wife could become a capital crime, with
the rabbi himself facing a death sentence.
</P>
<P>
   If Camden County Prosecutor Lee Solomon decides to seek the
death penalty against Rabbi Fred J. Neulander, experts say it would
be the first time since New Jersey re-enacted the law that jurors
would be asked to execute a clergyman.
</P>
<P>
   Those on both sides of the debate say the case highlights legal
pitfalls and moral challenges posed by the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a potential problem for a prosecutor. You're damned if
you do, and damned if you don't,'' said Dale Jones, an assistant
public defender who specializes in capital murder trials.
</P>
<P>
   If Solomon does not seek a death sentence, he could be accused
of favoring a white middle-class defendant with the ability to hire
two private lawyers, Jones said. Saying the crime warrants
execution could be seen as vindictive.
</P>
<P>
   But the decision not to push for a death sentence could be based
more pragmatically on the difficulties in prosecuting a rabbi,
Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Neulander would be the first clergyman to face a capital murder
charge in New Jersey, Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly six years after Carol Neulander's beating death, two men
said they were hired by the rabbi to commit the murder.
</P>
<P>
   Private investigator Leonard Jenoff and Paul Michael Daniels
told investigators they showed up at Carol Neulander's Cherry Hill
home with a lead pipe, intent on killing her, according to
prosecutors and defense lawyers for the suspects.
</P>
<P>
   Until May 1, Fred Neulander was the only person accused in the
Nov. 1, 1994, death of his 52-year-old wife. He was not charged
until September 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Neulander's lawyers maintain that the rabbi did not kill his
wife, despite accusations of infidelity on his part. They say she
was killed by an intruder in a possible robbery.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors had theorized that Neulander had his wife killed so
he could continue an affair, fearful a divorce would harm his
standing as senior rabbi at Congregation M'Kor Shalom, which he
founded with his wife in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Murder for hire is one of several factors that allow prosecutors
to seek the death penalty if a defendant is found guilty.
</P>
<P>
   Before they decide, prosecutors must review the case and weigh
those factors against possible material the defense might present
to a jury in a defendant's favor. Included in that assessment is
how well mitigating evidence -- for example, all the good a
defendant has done in his life -- could play before jurors.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors must seek the death penalty if they believe the
aggravating factor -- in this case the plan to pay killers for the
murder -- exists, said Michael E. Riley, a former Burlington County
first assistant prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   Under New Jersey law, every juror must agree that the
aggravating factor exists and outweighs evidence in the rabbi's
life that suggests life in prison would be a better sentence.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's why it's a horse race when it comes to a case like
this,'' said Riley, now in private practice.
</P>
<P>
   For the defense, jury selection is critical, Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Some jurors might be swayed by a life of good works before the
murder, the public defender said. Others might feel Neulander ''had
all the accouterments of white middle-class respectability'' and
therefore be predisposed toward execution, Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   ''They might think, 'But that guy has no excuse,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Solomon has not said how the arrests of Daniels and Jenoff will
affect charges against Neulander. He said his office ''will review
and re-evaluate'' the case and decide whether to seek the death
penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's a decision I'll have to make further down the road,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Neulander's trial, scheduled to begin June 19, has been
postponed. A conference to discuss the trial schedule is slated for
Sept. 5.
</P>
<P>
   His attorney, Dennis Wixted, declined to comment on possible
aggravating factors until the prosecutor makes his decision.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Neulander has said he found his wife's body when he
returned from Congregation M'Kor Shalom synagogue.
</P>
<P>
   Neulander, who was indicted in January 1999, remains free on
$400,000 bail.
</P>
<P>
   Jenoff and Daniels have been held in the Camden County Jail
since their arrests. Daniels is being held on $400,000 cash bail;
Jenoff's is $250,000.
</P>
<P>
   For death penalty opponents, the rabbi's case is not
extraordinary.
</P>
<P>
   ''It doesn't change our position whether he's guilty or not,
whether he's a rabbi or a homeless person, no one deserves to
die,'' said Lois Seeligshon, a spokeswoman for New Jerseyans for a
Death Penalty Moratorium.

<HEADLINE> Allegations Made in Sierra Leone  </HEADLINE>
By CLARENCE ROY-MACAULAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) -- The feared rebel leader who
restarted Sierra Leone's civil war this month has been striking
illegal deals with international diamond firms in return for
military equipment and other supplies, the justice minister said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Revolutionary United Front leader Foday Sankoh -- who during the
country's short-lived peace was put in charge of a commission
regulating mineral policy -- tried to trade or sell gems abroad for
his own enrichment and to fund his rebel movement, said the
minister, Solomon Berewa, who is also the attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   During a February trip to South Africa for medical treatment,
Sankoh conducted deals ''in a reckless manner,'' Berewa said. The
rebel leader gave one diamond company a list of supplies he wanted
-- including drugs, military equipment, radio and television gear,
political campaign materials and school supplies.
</P>
<P>
   South Africa eventually withdrew Sankoh's visa after a U.N.
Security Council committee overseeing sanctions against Sierra
Leone protested that he had violated a travel ban.
</P>
<P>
   Sankoh and his rebels have waged an eight-year war to oust
President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah's government. In a campaign of terror,
the rebels killed tens of thousands of people, and intentionally
mutilated or dismembered many more.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels are also believed to have seized about 500 U.N.
peacekeepers last week, and were holding them hostage.
</P>
<P>
   Sankoh abandoned his Freetown home Monday, and his whereabouts
were unknown. Earlier that day, demonstrators had swarmed his
house, and his bodyguards shot and killed at least four of them.
</P>
<P>
   Sierra Leonean and U.N. officials have been searching for Sankoh
since his disappearance. But it was unclear if authorities would
press charges while the rebels still held the peacekeepers hostage.
</P>
<P>
   Pro-government forces and the United Nations have managed to
restore relative calm in the capital, Freetown. But anarchy still
reigned in the rest of the West African country.
</P>
<P>
   In Sankoh's abandoned home, which was looted after he left,
officials found documents describing the illegal gem deals or
negotiations with several ''well-known'' companies and individuals
based abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ''The names are so many,'' Berewa said. ''Foday Sankoh was
anxious to have power.'' It was unclear when the officials found
the documents, or if the Justice Ministry had ordered the search.
</P>
<P>
   One document recorded Sankoh receiving 2,134 diamond pieces --
347 carats in gem-quality stones and 95 carats of industrial stones
worth at least $150,000 -- from rebel mining activities between
August 1999 and January 2000, Berewa said.
</P>
<P>
   The minister said one of the businessmen named in the documents
suggested Sankoh had smuggled the diamonds from Sierra Leone by
bringing a helicopter to the rebel-controlled eastern Kono region
and flying the gems to neighboring Guinea or Liberia.
</P>
<P>
   Under Sierra Leone's power-sharing peace deal, signed in July,
Sankoh was appointed Vice president and chairman of a state
minerals commission. His rebel fighters were given unconditional
pardons for war atrocities.
</P>
<P>
   However, the minerals commission was not allowed to issue
licenses, give concessions or export gems, Berewa said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This commission was not supposed to usurp the functions of the
Ministry of Resources,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Overnight Friday, the rebels attacked the eastern city of Port
Loko twice, but were driven back by government forces, state-run
radio reported Saturday. Port Loko, about 45 miles northeast of
Freetown, is on a key highway linking the capital to the border
with Guinea.
</P>
<P>
   There was no independent confirmation of the battle, though the
rebels have reportedly been targeting Port Loko in recent days
because reinforcements have made Freetown increasingly resistant to
assault.
</P>
<P>
   A British naval frigate, the Argyll, was expected to arrive off
Sierra Leone's coast Saturday night to provide communications
support to British paratroopers based at the airport outside
Freetown, officials said in London.
</P>
<P>
   The Argyll, the Royal Navy's West Africa guard ship, will later
be joined by the aircraft carrier Illustrious and helicopter
carrier Ocean, carrying 800 Royal Marines, along with three smaller
vessels.
</P>
<P>
   About 700 British soldiers are already bolstering the defense of
Freetown after arriving to help evacuate British expatriates. On
Friday, more peacekeepers, including a few hundred Jordanian
troops, arrived in Freetown to reinforce the beleaguered U.N.
peacekeepers.

   TriNet uses advanced seismometers and computers to capture data
and uniformly analyze it. Within minutes of a quake, it maps
regions of intensity and probable hardest-hit areas. Rescue crews
then can be dispatched, engineers can monitor weakened buildings
and utilities can target repair crews.
</P>
<P>
   TriNet is primarily funded with Federal Emergency Management
Agency grants made after the 1994 Northridge quake. The networks at
that time helped determine its size and epicenter, but could not
discern pockets of intensity and some data were thrown off-scale by
such a large quake.
</P>
<P>
   TriNet has 110 new, high-quality instruments that can handle
both small and large quakes. By the end of next year, Southern
California will be blanketed with 670 seismometers.
</P>
<P>
   The system, established in 1997, performed flawlessly in its
first big test, last October's magnitude-7.1 Hector Mine
earthquake, showing immediately that the temblor's energy was not
directed at any urban areas.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters say TriNet's value would be even more apparent after
catastrophes like last year's quakes in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   ''You watched all these people dying three days after the
earthquake in Turkey because it took so long to figure out the
scale of what they were dealing with,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   TriNet may be a victim of its own success. State and federal
officials want to see it expanded and are directing money elsewhere
-- not to the existing Southern California project.
</P>
<P>
   The USGS has proposed the Advanced National Seismic System, a
$170.8 million, five-year project that would fold in TriNet. Last
year's federal budget funded seismic stations in Northern
California, the Pacific Northwest and Utah. President Clinton's
proposed budget seeks $2.5 million for the system, but doesn't
direct any money to Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   The state could decide to pick up the tab by including funding
in the budget revision Gov. Gray Davis is set to unveil Monday. Tom
Mullins, spokesman for the governor's Office of Emergency Services,
said the state supports TriNet and would like to see it expanded
statewide.
</P>
<P>
   ''The state now looks at Southern California and sees it being
ahead,'' said Caltech geophysicist Egill Hauksson. ''And, of
course, they want to put more into Northern California to allow
them to catch up.''

<HEADLINE> Image Problem Targeted in Romania  </HEADLINE>
By ALISON MUTLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   SNAGOV, Romania (AP) -- The problem of abandoned children is a
''great insult to most Romanians,'' the prime minister said
Saturday, calling for new measures to reduce the number of
youngsters in the country's orphanages.
</P>
<P>
   About 150,000 children live in government institutions, many of
them abandoned by parents too poor to care for them.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a great insult to most Romanians, 99 percent of whom do
not abandon their children,'' Prime Minister Mugur Isarescu said at
the lakeside resort of Snagov, 25 miles north of Bucharest. ''I am
emotionally upset by this.''
</P>
<P>
   Isarescu was to meet EU officials in Brussels this week about
the abandoned children -- a problem the Eastern European country
must solve before gaining status as an EU member.
</P>
<P>
   In Brussels, Romanian officials planned to outline programs to
EU leaders on how to move children out of orphanages and into
families.
</P>
<P>
   But the plight of Romania's children -- many of whom live in
remote homes, rural towns and in the poorest areas -- was ''a human
drama that costs a fortune,'' Isarescu said. Sources close to the
premier said the programs would require international funding.
</P>
<P>
   It costs about $100 a month -- more than the average monthly
salary -- to keep a child in an institution.
</P>
<P>
   ''The larger the institution, the bigger the problems,'' he
said. ''Children must be taken into families or family-type
institutions. It is a beginning, and very important for the
country.''
</P>
<P>
   Former dictator Nicole Ceausecsu outlawed abortion and birth
control in an effort to increase population. Today, abortion is the
most popular form of birth control.
</P>
<P>
   ''These children are caused by poverty, by 20 years of sexual
ignorance,'' the prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
   Romania's abandoned children -- who were hidden away under
Ceausescu -- were first revealed after the collapse of communism.
Aid flooded into the country, and international adoptions began to
take place.

<HEADLINE> Navy Tackles Belgian Oil Slick  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- The Belgian navy was working Saturday
to disperse an oil slick spread 25 miles off the popular beaches of
the country's North Sea coast.
</P>
<P>
   In some places the oil was as close as 1\ miles from the coast,
but the navy was confident the slick could be broken up and the oil
evaporated before it hit the shore.
</P>
<P>
   ''We expect most will be dispersed,'' Cmdr. William Blomme said
by telephone from the port of Zeebrugge. ''The risk for the beaches
is rather small.''
</P>
<P>
   Patches of oil up to 3 yards wide were detected Saturday along
the Belgium's 30 mile coastline from Zeebrugge, in the north, to
Nieuwpoort, close to the French border in the south.
</P>
<P>
   Blomme said a naval vessel had dispersed a large patch off
Zeebrugge, and was working its way down the coast breaking up the
oil on its way. The cleanup operation was helped by calm seas and
bright sunshine, which was evaporating the oil.
</P>
<P>
   He said the pollution was most likely caused by a leaking ship
or a vessel cleaning its oil tanks at sea. Samples of the oil would
be taken in an effort to trace the source, Blomme said.
</P>
<P>
   The Belgian navy warned coast guards in Britain, France and the
Netherlands about the possible pollution risk.

<HEADLINE> Giuliani mulls future after a wild week  </HEADLINE>
By BETH GARDINER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- At the end of a grueling, topsy-turvy week,
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani canceled an upstate campaign speech Saturday
and spent much of the day resting and mulling his medical options
as uncertainty hung over his Senate campaign.
</P>
<P>
   An announcement about whether the mayor plans to stay in the
U.S. Senate race against Hillary Rodham Clinton could come as soon
as Sunday or Monday, according to a person who was very
knowledgeable about Giuliani's discussions with political advisers
and spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor backed out of a Delaware County GOP dinner in Oneonta
where he was to have been the keynote speaker. Aides said he was
staying in New York City and thinking about how to proceed with
treatment for his prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
   But he also held a surprise news conference in the Bronx,
playing his favorite public role -- mayor in charge of a city
emergency -- after police discovered several barrels of stolen
cyanide.
</P>
<P>
   After briefing reporters on emergency workers' efforts, Giuliani
cautioned the press not to read too much into his decision to
cancel the Oneonta event.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've decided that I needed the time to do some consultation,''
he said. ''At this point I don't think I was up to taking the trip,
actually just taking the trip in the car for three hours. ... It
wasn't a good idea to do it healthwise.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's campaign manager, Bruce Teitelbaum, said that as of
early Saturday Giuliani had not made a decision about whether to
proceed with the Senate campaign and wouldn't do so until he had
more time to consider his medical options.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know what he's going to do,'' Teitelbaum said.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign spokeswoman Kim Serafin said a California fund-raising
trip planned for Tuesday and Wednesday was still on the mayor's
schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ''Right now nothing else has been taken off,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But Giuliani warned that some campaign events were likely to be
canceled, explaining that marital strife had prevented him from
speaking with all the doctors he needed to consult last week. The
mayor's marriage to Donna Hanover crumbled very publicly, as he
announced that they planned to separate and she retaliated by
accusing him of having had a relationship with a City Hall aide.
</P>
<P>
   ''You should not view the fact that I will cancel several things
next week as anything other than the fact that I didn't get the
chance to meet with the doctors that I had to meet with last week
... for obvious reasons, because of personal issues that came up,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said when he revealed his illness that he would likely
cut his campaign schedule in half.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's personal life remained a subject of intense
speculation. Just days after declaring that his marriage was
ending, he dined out Friday with Judith Nathan, the woman he has
called his ''very good friend.''
</P>
<P>
   As political wags wondered how personal woes would affect
Giuliani's standing with voters, he and Nathan ate with several
aides at an Italian restaurant on the Upper East Side of Manhattan
and then smiled for photographers.
</P>
<P>
   The group walked Nathan home, where she kissed each of her
dining companions on the cheek and gave the mayor a goodbye hug.
</P>
<P>
   The city's tabloids gobbled up the story, contrasting Giuliani's
night out with Hanover's flight to her parents' California home.
</P>
<P>
   ''Rudy and Judi Take it To Streets,'' said a New York Post
headline. ''Walkin' My Baby Back Home,'' said the Daily News front
page.
</P>
<P>
   He declined to comment on the evening, telling reporters ''It
speaks for itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani had spent part of Friday closeted with political
advisers. A person very knowledgeable about the discussions, who
spoke on condition of anonymity, said that as the conversations
proceeded, Giuliani sounded increasingly discouraged about the
prospects for his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The source said that pessimism was reflected in ''the type of
questions that he's asking and the kinds of comments he's making
after we give him answers.''
</P>
<P>
   Cautioning that the situation was extremely fluid, the source
said the mayor was going back and forth in his thinking about
whether to stay in the race. The source said that the mayor's inner
circle did not expect a decision before Sunday or Monday at the
earliest.
</P>
<P>
   In public remarks Friday, Giuliani made clear that his health
was his top priority but promised a decision soon on the Senate
race.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm going to make a decision as quickly as I can responsibly
make it,'' he told reporters. ''I do feel that I have an obligation
to the party.''

<HEADLINE> Reports: Ivory Coast Ballots Up  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) -- Ivory Coast's military ruler will
allow presidential elections in September and a legislative ballot
the following month, press reports said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   President Robert Guei told diplomats in the commercial capital,
Abidjan, on Friday that presidential elections were scheduled for
Sept. 17 and a subsequent round of voting would be held on Oct. 8
if there is no outright winner in the first round, state television
reported.
</P>
<P>
   The country's legislative ballot will be held on Oct. 29.
</P>
<P>
   A constitutional referendum will be held on July 23 to decide on
changes to Ivory Coast's basic law.
</P>
<P>
   Guei did not say if he would run for president, as some
observers have speculated he would. However, in a state radio
address, he warned ''troublemaker'' politicians not to foment
violence or civil war, saying he would respond against ''force with
force.''
</P>
<P>
   Guei, a longtime military officer, declared himself president
after troops took power in a Christmas Eve coup, toppling President
Henri Konan Bedie's government. It was Ivory Coast's first coup.
</P>
<P>
   Although the takeover was initially very popular with Ivorians
who had grown tired of corruption and ethnic favoritism under
Bedie, that enthusiasm has since died down.
</P>
<P>
   Soldiers have been accused of harassing civilians and summarily
killing suspected criminals. Guei himself has suggested he may not
allow some popular opposition leaders to run for the presidency
because they do not conform to constitutional requirements.

   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) -- The feared rebel leader who restarted Sierra
Leone's civil war this month has been striking illegal deals with international
diamond firms in return for military equipment and other supplies, the justice
minister said Saturday. Revolutionary United Front leader Foday Sankoh -- who
during the country's short-lived peace was put in charge of a commission
regulating mineral policy -- tried to trade or sell gems abroad for his own
enrichment and to fund his rebel movement, said the minister, Solomon Berewa,

creed -- the worth of every person as an individual,'' Bush told a crowd of

Demonstrations demanding the release of some 1,600 Palestinians held in Israeli
jails were slated to continue tomorrow, even as negotiators were scheduled to
meet in Jerusalem in an effort to discuss the issue. In the West Bank town of
Tulkarem, about 300 Palestinians demanding the release of Palestinian prisoners

Vatican Discloses Last Secret of Fatima

   FATIMA, Portugal (AP) -- Ending an enduring mystery, the Vatican disclosed
the so-called third secret of Fatima today, saying the secret the Virgin Mary is
said to have told two children more than 80 years ago was a foretelling of the
shooting of Pope John Paul II. Since 1917 -- when two shepherd children said the
mother of Christ appeared above an olive tree in Fatima and told them three
secrets -- many have speculated about the third. The first two are said to have
foretold the end of World War I and the start of World War II, and the rise and
fall of Soviet communism. Some believed the third, unrevealed secret was a
doomsday prophecy foretelling the end of the world.

Putin Establishes Russian Districts

   MOSCOW (AP) -- President Vladimir Putin issued a decree today dividing Russia
into seven districts, each with its own Kremlin representative -- an apparent
effort to assert more central control over the provinces. Russia's 89 provinces,
some of which have been testing the limits of autonomy since the 1991 Soviet
collapse, will be grouped under the new system, according to the decree. The
move will help ''increase the effectiveness of the federal organs of power and
improve control over compliance with their decisions,'' it said.

homers and two RBIs, and was in the midst of a rough week. Henderson was placed

Hundreds gather to celebrate Falun Gong's eighth birthday

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK -- American practitioners of Falun Gong, a meditative
practice banned in China, celebrated the spiritual movement's
eighth anniversary Saturday, the same day fellow Falun Gong
practitioners were beaten and detained in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Founder Li Hongzhi, who reportedly lives in New York, did not
attend the Manhattan celebration. The crowd of about 300
practitioners lauded the perseverance of movement members in China,
where Falun Gong is illegal, before performing the practice's
meditative routine.
</P>
<P>
   ''Chinese society has been torn apart this past year as 70
million people have been denied their basic human rights,'' Adam
Montanero said in a speech during the opening ceremony. ''We look
to them for inspiration.''
</P>
<P>
   A feeling of serenity pervaded Bryant Park as the ethnically
mixed group of practitioners performed the routine, which consists
of traditional slow-motion exercises reminiscent of Tai-Chi, to the
strains of simple, placid, Chinese music.
</P>
<P>
   Practitioners claim that the philosophy behind the practice,
drawn from Buddhism, Taoism and the ideas of founder Li Hongzhi,
promotes health and mental well-being.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is about hope, about helping sick people,'' said Xu Ya
Ming, who said she suffers from liver disease and fled China nine
months ago after being arrested and told not to practice Falun Gong
any more.
</P>
<P>
   ''She needs to do this for her health,'' her sister Angela Xu,
of Morris Plains, N.J., said.
</P>
<P>
   In sharp contrast to the celebration in New York, police in
Beijing punched, knocked over and dragged away about 50 followers
of the banned sect as group members defiantly celebrated the
anniversary in Tiananmen Square
</P>
<P>
   Chinese leaders, who banned the practice over nine months ago,
have called the group a public menace and a threat to Communist
Party authority.
</P>
<P>
   They have accused Falun Gong of cheating people by making them
buy expensive instructional books and causing over 1,500 deaths,
mostly among practitioners who refused medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
   New York followers argued otherwise Saturday, saying that the
movement does not have a centralized organizational structure, is
not politically motivated and does not purport to cure illness.
</P>
<P>
   ''It does not cure illness, but if you are sick, it can do a lot
to alleviate pain and mental anguish,' said Sam Wang, whose late
mother was an ardent follower in China.
</P>
<P>
   When asked to explain what the practice does for followers, many
found themselves unable to find the words.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is impossible to put this into words because doing so
diminishes its meaning. It is more magnificent than that,'' said
Emory Moore, who has practiced Falun Gong for three years. ''You
can't use human language to explain heaven.''

<HEADLINE> Mets Release Rickey Henderson  </HEADLINE>
By RONALD BLUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Rickey Henderson got what we wanted: his
release.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball's career steals leader, angry since the start of spring
training because the New York Mets wouldn't raise his $1.9 million
salary, was let go Saturday, one day after failing to run out a
drive.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't cause them to lose. Look someplace else,'' Henderson
said before quickly leaving the clubhouse following a 7-6 loss to
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson, 41, was batting just .219 with no homers and two
RBIs, and was in the midst of a rough week.
</P>
<P>
   He was placed on waivers Monday -- no team claimed him -- and then
was booed by Shea Stadium fans and criticized by manager Bobby
Valentine for his lack of hustle in Friday night's 6-4 loss. Prior
to Saturday's game, Henderson shouted at a reporter.
</P>
<P>
   ''After considering everything that happened last night and this
morning, something had to be done,'' Mets general manager Steve
Phillips said. ''I think the reasons are fairly obvious. No matter
how talent you have, if you continue to create problems and
situations, you wear out your welcome. We got to the point where we
had to compromise our ideals and what we expect from our players
too often.''
</P>
<P>
   Henderson did not start Saturday, played left field in the ninth
inning and did not bat. During the day, the Mets contacted every
other major league team to try to work out a trade but got no
interest.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope the guys respond to it favorably and understand this is
the way to go for the group,'' said Valentine, whose team has lost
nine of 12 and fell to 19-19 this season.
</P>
<P>
   Players didn't think Henderson had become a distraction but
understood the reasoning.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought he was a good teammate,'' Mike Piazza said. ''It was
very important last year -- all-time greatest leadoff hitter in the
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Under baseball's rules, Henderson was placed on unconditional
release waivers Saturday, immediately removing him from the active
roster. If he isn't claimed -- and it's virtually assured he won't
be -- he would become a free agent at 2 p.m. EDT Wednesday. Any team
could then sign him for a prorated share of the major league
minimum -- about $155,000. The Mets would be responsible for the
rest of his salary.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't anticipate having a problem finding him a place to
play,'' said Henderson's agent, Jeff Borris. ''A lot of people
think Rickey has a lot of baseball left in him. Rickey has had a
spectacular career, and it would be a blemish if it ended this way.
There are a couple of major milestones that he still wants to
achieve.''
</P>
<P>
   Henderson sought a trade -- the Mets talked to Detroit about a
deal involving outfielder Bobby Higginson -- and also complained
about having to make the 7,400-mile trip to Tokyo for the Mets'
season-opening series against the Chicago Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   During his career, he often has slumped when unhappy. Last
season, after signing with the Mets as a free agent, he hit .315
with a .423 on-base percentage -- best among NL leadoff men -- and
stole 37 bases.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Henderson has stolen five bases in seven tries,
raising his career steals total to 1,339.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, his first-inning drive off Ryan Dempster hit the
left-field wall. He jogged to first, thinking it was a home run,
and wound up with a single.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not acceptable,'' Valentine said.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson read an account of play in the New York Post and
shouted at the reporter who wrote the story.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm going to do it over again if I feel I hit a home run,''
the 10-time All-Star said to the Post's Andrew Marchand. ''I know
more baseball than you can think about. You probably were a baby
when I first started playing this game.''
</P>
<P>
   During the confrontation by Henderson's corner stall, he told
Marchand, who is 25, that the only reason he didn't beat him up was
Henderson had ''respect'' for people.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few minutes before the shouting, Phillips was asked if
Henderson's time with the team was close to an end. Phillips made a
point of looking at his watch before humorously saying, ''No.''
</P>
<P>
   Henderson and other Mets spent an hour in the outfield Saturday
morning bantering with fans as part of a photo day promotion.
Sitting with sunglasses on, he posed for pictures, smiled and
charmed the customers.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine spoke with Henderson in the dugout right after the
first-inning at-bat Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't really get an answer,'' the manager said.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips said he didn't think there was anything he or Valentine
could do alter the behavior of Henderson, now in his 22nd major
league season.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not going to change Rickey at this point,'' Phillips
said.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine, who turned 50 Saturday, took a long time to answer
questions about Henderson before Saturday's game, tapping a letter
opener on his fingers and desk while thinking out his responses.
</P>
<P>
   ''You'd like to think people know the difference between right
and wrong,'' Valentine said. ''It's basically what everything's
built on.''
</P>
<P>
   Talking with reporters after Friday night's game, Henderson said
he didn't do anything wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ''I should have been running no harder than I ran. I thought it
was a home run,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Henderson didn't run out a ball on a similar play
against Atlanta, which was noted Saturday by Valentine. Henderson
also created a stir when he and Bobby Bonilla were accused of
playing cards in the Mets' clubhouse during the season-ending,
extra-inning loss at Atlanta in the NL championship series.
</P>
<P>
   Bonilla was released during the offseason and signed with the
Braves. The Mets are paying most of his salary, too, spreading out
about $29 million in payments from 2011-35.

   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) -- Ron Powlus hit LC Stevens on a
34-yard touchdown pass with 3:28 remaining in overtime Saturday and
the Amsterdam Admirals scored their second NFL Europe overtime win
this season, defeating the Berlin Thunder 24-21.
</P>
<P>
   Thunder kicker Jaret Holmes was true from 49 yards after
regulation ended 18-18, but NFL Europe League rules allow each team
an overtime possession. Powlus then connected with Stevens to give
Amsterdam a 3-2 and a share of second place with the Scottish
Claymores.

<HEADLINE> Eight Rockets Explode in Baghdad  </HEADLINE>
By WAIEL FALEH
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- Wails of sorrow mixed with calls for
revenge Saturday hours after rockets shook Baghdad in the third
bombardment in less than two months on the heart of the tightly
policed Iraqi capital.
</P>
<P>
   A 3-year-old girl, Zahra Mohammed Hammeed, was killed and four
of her relatives were wounded in the attack, which Iran-based Iraqi
dissidents said targeted the presidential palace.
</P>
<P>
   ''My home, my home is destroyed. My child is dead now. My
brother and I are hurt. Everything is destroyed, what more do you
want?'' said Wafa Kareem Jassim, Zahra's mother.
</P>
<P>
   Two rockets struck homes in the Karadat Mariam district west of
Baghdad at just after midnight, residents said, leaving Jassim's
house a heap of rubble. Several other rockets, they said, exploded
in an open space nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein Mohammed, Zahra's uncle whose home next door was
slightly damaged by another explosion, said the rocket that killed
Zahra landed next to her bed. ''Dust was all over and we could not
see anything at first. Then we found Zahra who was already dead,''
said Mohammed.
</P>
<P>
   Targeting the presidential palace -- about two miles (3.2
kilometers) from where the missiles landed -- made Saturday's attack
the most daring by the Iranian-backed Iraqi dissidents who claimed
responsibility for it.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq issued
statements in London and Syria saying the attack was carried out by
its affiliate, the Iraqi National Islamic Resistance.
</P>
<P>
   In Damascus, the council said assailants fired nine Katyusha
rockets at presidential palace offices ''in retaliation for the
great violations of the Iraqi people by the repressive Iraqi
regime.''
</P>
<P>
   In London, the council's Hamid al-Bayati said five rockets were
fired at the palace and four at a government building nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Odai al-Taie, director general of the state-run Iraqi News
Agency, pointing the finger at Iran, vowed in an interview that
Saturday's strike ''will not pass without punishment.'' He did not
elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, the official Iraqi News Agency quoted an unidentified
Interior Ministry official pledging retaliation: ''The Iraqi
government holds the Iranian regime fully responsible for these
vicious acts.'' Iran will ''pay for these crimes,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq and Iran fought an eight-year war that ended with a
U.N.-brokered cease-fire in 1988. The neighbors never signed a
peace treaty and their relations since the end of the war have
remained tense. Each harbors dissident groups fighting the other's
government.
</P>
<P>
   Both governments, however, distance themselves from such attacks
and label them acts of domestic resistance.
</P>
<P>
   On May 1, rockets exploded near the headquarters of Iraq's
General Directorate of Security in Baghdad, wounding eight people.
At about the same time, police headquarters in Tehran, Iran, were
targeted by mortar fire in an attack that wounded six people.
Iranian rebels of the Mujahedeen Khalq -- a group based in Iraq --
claimed responsibility for that attack.
</P>
<P>
   On March 22, a mortar attack on the same area killed four people
and injured 38.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the bombings, more than 1,000 Iranian pilgrims pour into
Iraq every day to pay homage at Shiite Muslim sites in the country.
In the past two months, Iran also has freed 2,479 Iraqi prisoners
captured during the war.
</P>
<P>
   Mistrust lingers with Iraq seeing itself as beleaguered by
hostile neighbors. Its relations are strained with all but Jordan.
Its pleas for rapprochement with Iran have gone unheeded.
</P>
<P>
   According to Baghdad-based diplomats, who spoke on condition
they not be named, Iran has turned down an Iraqi offer to rein in
Iranian exiles on its territory provided that Tehran ends cross
border attacks by Iraqi dissidents on its soil.

<HEADLINE> Miami Carters' Shot Still Debated  </HEADLINE>
By CHRIS SHERIDAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The debate over Anthony Carter's game-winning
shot from behind the backboard raged anew on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the New York Knicks still believe the basket should
have been waved off, and the Miami Heat still insist it was good as
called.
</P>
<P>
   Rule No. 8, Section II, Paragraph b. states that ''any ball that
rebounds or passes behind the backboard, in either direction, from
any point is considered out of bounds.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter's shot with 2.2 seconds left did indeed float behind the
backboard before it arched over the top, but the referees ruled
that the ball crossed the top corner of the backboard on an angle
and therefore remained in play.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know what they're griping about,'' Miami's Tim
Hardaway said. ''Good shot, game over with, everybody deal with
it.''
</P>
<P>
   After viewing the replay from several different angles and
hearing the referees' explanation, Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy
would not back off his statements of Friday night that the basket
should have been nullified.
</P>
<P>
   ''I stand by what I said. But I'm also not looking back, I'm
looking forward to getting ready for tomorrow. There's no point in
looking back,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The referees made the right 'no-call.' You don't make a call
unless you're 100 percent certain,'' NBA vice president of
operations Rod Thorn said. ''It's inconclusive from the replays.''
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1960s, the NBA instituted the over-the-backboard
rule in response to the way Wilt Chamberlain was dominating the
game. As a rookie with Philadelphia in 1959-60 when he averaged
37.6 points, Chamberlain often scored on inbounds passes from the
baseline when a teammate would simply lob the ball over the
backboard.
</P>
<P>
   The league also widened the lane and outlawed offensive
goaltending and running starts on free throws in an effort to deter
Chamberlain's dominance.
</P>
<P>
   ''Those are all the ''Wilt Rules,'' said Philadelphia 76ers
statistician Harvey Pollack, an NBA employee for 53 years and a
witness to Chamberlain's 100-point game. ''To understand the
mindset of the league office at the time, you'd have to be a master
psychologist.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether it was technically legal or not, Carter's shot gave the
Heat a 2-1 lead in the best-of-seven series heading into Sunday's
Game 4.
</P>
<P>
   Miami improved to 4-4 at Madison Square Garden in playoff games
over the past four seasons, giving the Heat a .500 record to go
along with their 6-6 home record against the Knicks in the
postseason.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think anybody who's an intelligent viewer who's been
watching for years knows it was a no-call. Whether or not it
crossed barely or whatever, the game's over,'' Riley said. ''We're
up 2-1, the homecourt advantage doesn't mean anything. We're moving
on to Game 4, they can lament that all they want.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter's miracle shot wouldn't have happened if Riley hadn't had
the faith to stick with the rookie, who played the entire overtime
period and most of the fourth quarter instead of Hardaway, who was
hobbled by a sprained foot and scored only one point.
</P>
<P>
   ''A.C. was playing so well that I didn't want to take him out. I
don't want to hurt the team by playing someone who's hurt, and I've
done that before in my career,'' Riley said. ''Tim never hurts the
team, but we have to be realistic about his injury. Last night it
was very sore.''
</P>
<P>
   Hardaway said he would play in Game 4, and Riley said he was
leaning toward starting him.
</P>
<P>
   After putting his team through a 2-hour, 15-minute practice,
Riley said he was concerned with his team's mental state. Not
wanting them to be satisfied with winning Game 3, he said they
needed to make an attitude adjustment sometime Saturday night or
Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm tired of having the advantage and giving it back, winning
and then relaxing and thinking we've got something. I'm tired of
players' attitudes about 'OK, we got a leg up on them and tomorrow
we're going to come back and not play with the same kind of
ferocity.'
</P>
<P>
   ''Somewhere we've got to be men and step up and put some
big-time pressure on this team. That's what our opportunity is
tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter, meanwhile, ran across a few Knicks fans after the game
who teased him about the shot.
</P>
<P>
   ''They told me Merry Christmas, lucky shot, stuff like that. But
I'll take it. I didn't tell them that, but I'll take it.''

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Says 'No' on Iraq Relations  </HEADLINE>
By DIANA ELIAS
<TEXT>
<P>
   KUWAIT (AP) -- Iraq must comply with all U.N. Security Council
resolutions before Kuwait will consider any resumption of normal
ties with its former occupier, Kuwait's foreign minister said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''These resolutions are the basis of future relations with
Iraq,'' Sheik Sabah Al Ahmed Al Sabah said at the opening of a
seminar on Kuwaiti-Iraqi ties. ''Iraq's full compliance is the
first step toward any future outlook for establishing correct and
strong relations.''
</P>
<P>
   Desert borders between the two Arab neighbors have been closed
since the 1991 Gulf War that ended Iraq's seven-month occupation of
its small, oil-rich Gulf neighbor. A demilitarized border zone is
patrolled by U.N. observers.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. resolutions call for dismantling Iraq's mass
destruction weapons and eliminating its ability to manufacture
them, returning looted Kuwaiti property and accounting for about
600 missing Kuwaitis and other nationals.
</P>
<P>
   Sheik Sabah said the fate of the missing was especially
important to Kuwaitis -- and to having any chance of resuming normal
ties.
</P>
<P>
   Baghdad insists it released all war prisoners after the war
ended. Iraqi authorities have said they lost track of about 125
prisoners in an uprising in southern Iraq that followed the war.
</P>
<P>
   Sheik Sabah told the seminar, organized by Kuwait's Parliament,
that the two peoples ''had no choice but to live together in this
area in security and peace, away from struggles and wars.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he was optimistic about future prospects for doing so,
but he didn't say why.
</P>
<P>
   Conference organizers were quick to point out to participants
and observers, who included members of the Iraqi opposition, that
the gathering was not a call for reestablishing ties with the Iraqi
government. No Iraqi officials were invited.
</P>
<P>
   Mohammad al-Saqer, a member of the house's foreign affairs
panel, said: ''To avoid any chances of a misunderstanding ... I say
it frankly and clearly that this seminar should not give anyone the
impression that it is an invitation for building any type of
bridges with the current regime in Baghdad.''

<HEADLINE> Guerrillas Attack Israeli Outpost  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NABATIYEH, Lebanon (AP) -- Israeli warplanes bombarded suspected
guerrilla positions in southern Lebanon on Saturday following a
guerrilla attack on an Israeli outpost, Lebanese security officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   Two Israeli jets fired two missiles on hills and valleys near
the village of Habboush, two miles east of the market town of
Nabatiyeh, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Jets returned 15 minutes later to strike near the village of
Ahmadiyeh, 13 miles east of Habboush in Israel's self-styled
''security zone.''
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes before the air raids, guerrillas attacked an
outpost manned by Israeli troops and allied militiamen in the
occupied zone. The areas targeted by the jets are believed to be
used by guerrillas as bases.
</P>
<P>
   The Lebanese officials said guerrillas fired several rockets and
mortars at the Blatt outpost at Saturday evening, but had no word
on casualties or damage. The outpost is three miles north of
Israel's border with Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   In Jerusalem, the Israeli military confirmed the air raids but
did not immediately comment on the Blatt attack.
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah, or the Party of God, and the Lebanese resistance,
another Hezbollah-backed group, have led a fight to expel Israel
from the zone, which was carved out of southern Lebanon in 1985.
Israel says it needs the buffer region to protect its northern
settlements from cross-border guerrilla attacks. Some 1,500 Israeli
soldiers and the 2,500 SLA militiamen from the occupied zone
control the zone.

<HEADLINE> Utah's Jeff Hornacek May Retire  </HEADLINE>
By TIM KORTE
<TEXT>
<P>
   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Jeff Hornacek might be playing the last
game of his 14-year NBA career Sunday when Portland goes for a
four-game sweep of the Utah Jazz.
</P>
<P>
   But there are no tears or emotion. As he rationalized his
retirement at Saturday's practice, Hornacek couldn't have been more
steady if he was staring at a wide-open 3-pointer.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think anybody's worried about the end of an era,'' he
said. ''Guys just play. There will be a guy to take this spot next
year. It's no big deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Hornacek will be the first of Utah's so-called ''Big Three'' to
leave. After this season, Karl Malone has three years left on his
contract and John Stockton has one more year.
</P>
<P>
   Stockton, Malone and Hornacek led Utah to the NBA Finals in 1997
and 1998, where they lost to Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen and the
six-time champion Chicago Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan retired after hitting the game-winning shot to beat Utah
in Game 6 two years ago. Pippen's still playing, helping the Trail
Blazers to a 3-0 lead over the Jazz in the Western Conference
semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   Portland has dominated, putting Utah on the brink of being swept
in a best-of-seven series for the first time in franchise history.
The situation suggests the Jazz are finished as a consistent NBA
title contender.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it also marks the beginning of the end for Utah's
gritty, self-sacrificing approach, where long-term loyalty to
teammates has been rewarded in camaraderie if not NBA titles.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think it's anything we'll see again, particularly John
Stockton, the scrawny guy he is and such a feisty competitor,''
Pippen said. ''I don't expect to see another player like John.
</P>
<P>
   ''And Karl, you know he's just a different breed,'' Pippen said.
''He has a competitiveness that you can't duplicate. I don't expect
to see that type of tandem in this game again, not in my
lifetime.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonzi Wells, a second-year player who has stepped up for the
Blazers in the series, is awestruck by the monuments to Stockton
and Malone inside the Delta Center.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm used to watching Utah against Chicago in the finals at
home on my couch,'' Wells said. ''Being here, this is overwhelming
for me just to see the banners in the air, the things on the
wall.''
</P>
<P>
   Portland coach Mike Dunleavy said because of today's free agent
market, the league isn't likely to have another veteran core of
players who stick together so long.
</P>
<P>
   ''You like to see teams who can establish that kind of identity
and rapport with each other,'' Dunleavy said. ''They genuinely look
like they enjoy playing together.''
</P>
<P>
   Hornacek's arsenal of off-balance shots and his skill at the
free-throw line became hallmarks of the Jazz, as much an
identifying mark of the team as Stockton-to-Malone on the
pick-and-roll.
</P>
<P>
   Hornacek doesn't know if he'll ''feel comfortable'' with
retirement immediately after the season ends, but he expects to
settle in as the months pass, spending more time with his family.
</P>
<P>
   And he expects the Jazz to endure without him, at least until
Stockton and Malone retire.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every year you have changes,'' Hornacek said. ''You just move
on.''

<P>
   Bayer Leverkusen's first Bundesliga title is only one tie away.
</P>
<P>
   Leverkusen inched tantalizingly close to the championship
Saturday by thrashing Eintracht Frankfurt 4-1 with three goals
after halftime. Second-place Bayern Munich also won, 3-0 over
Arminia Bielefeld.
</P>
<P>
   Leverkusen has 73 standings points to Munich's 70, and the
season ends next week. Leverkusen, which has never finished first
since joining the Bundesliga in 1979, needs a victory or draw at
Unterhaching to clinch the title.
</P>
<P>
   Defending champion Munich, home to Werder Bremen in its finale,
needs to win and hope Leverkusen loses. If the clubs finished tied
on points, Munich would take its 16th title because of a larger
difference between goals-for and goals-against.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Flyers' Primeau May Play Game 1  </HEADLINE>
By TOM CANAVAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- In a season marked by cancer, concussions
and turmoil, the Philadelphia Flyers got some optimistic news on
the eve of the Eastern Conference finals against New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Center Keith Primeau, who suffered a concussion in Game 6 of the
Pittsburgh series, practiced with the Flyers on Saturday, and there
is an outside chance he will play in Game 1 of the best-of-seven
series that starts Sunday at the First Union Center.
</P>
<P>
   Before Saturday, it appeared that the earliest Primeau would
return would be for Game 2 on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   However, he skated for 20 minutes on his own on Saturday and
then talked to trainer John Worley. He got the OK to skate with the
team for some drills and appeared to have no problems.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been feeling really good,'' said Primeau, who had one of
the biggest goals of the season for the Flyers when he scored in
the fifth overtime of Game 4 with the Penguins to even the series.
''Every day I've been feeling better, and that's a positive.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Gary Dorshimer, the Flyers' team physician, will probably
have the final say on when Primeau can return.
</P>
<P>
   Primeau does not expect a final decision to be made until just
before game time, scheduled for 3 p.m. EDT.
</P>
<P>
   If Primeau does come back, it would be a lift the Flyers, who
have battled adversity all season.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Roger Neilson had to take a leave of absence on Feb. 20
because of a battle with multiple myeloma, a form of cancer. He was
replaced by assistant Craig Ramsay.
</P>
<P>
   Superstar center Eric Lindros missed the last 14 games of the
season with a Grade 2 concussion, and then he was stripped of his
captain's title for criticizing the team's doctors.
</P>
<P>
   There have also been other little problems that have now been
forgotten since the team got its act together under Ramsay and won
the Atlantic Division with a late-season rush and an accompanying
swoon by the Devils.
</P>
<P>
   Ramsay thought Primeau, injured in a collision with Pittsburgh
defenseman Bob Boughner, skated well.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was well enough after his own skate that he thought he
would participate in some of our drills, and he handled himself
well,'' Ramsay said. ''I haven't spoken to him since he came off.
It was encouraging.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Ramsay knows Primeau might not be ready on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's always nice to have one of your top guys playing,''
Ramsay said. ''But we emphasize the team and if we have to play
without him, we will.''
</P>
<P>
   The Devils, who beat the Flyers 4-1 in the season series,
weren't surprised by the possible change in Primeau's status.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't (see what) happened to him,'' Devils goalie Martin
Brodeur said after the Devils finished an hour-long practice
Saturday afternoon. ''I just know he got hurt a little bit. I guess
he's fine. We never really counted this guy out. We had him in all
the meetings. For us, he is part of the Flyers. We'll see if he
plays tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry Robinson, who has turned around the slumping Devils after
replacing Robbie Ftorek as coach with eight games left in the
regular season, is expecting a great series no matter who plays for
the Flyers.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have to give that team a lot of credit,'' Robinson said.
''They were 11 or 12 points behind us at one point, and they came
through and won the division. That says a lot about their team and
their character, and even more so after what they have gone
through. That is a good team we are playing against. We are only
kidding ourselves if we think they are not.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are tenacious workers, they hunt the puck down and they
are playing with a purpose now,'' he added.

<HEADLINE> Jewish Group: Toss Out Damage Award  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT WELLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- Lawyers for the Anti-Defamation League are
appealing a $10.5 million judgment against the organization for
defaming a couple the ADL publicly accused of being anti-Semitic.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Curtiss-Lusher, the ADL's Mountain States chairman, said
the ADL will not be intimidated by the decision, even if it's
upheld.
</P>
<P>
   Even though $10.5 million is nearly a quarter of the ADL's
worldwide budget of $45 million, ''ADL does have the resources to
pay whatever damages arise out of this case,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's quite important that the Anti-Defamation League continues
to pursue its mission and fight racism, bigotry, hatred, including
anti-Semitism. We've done so for 87 years and we will continue to
do so.''
</P>
<P>
   On April 28, a U.S. District Court jury decided the organization
had gone too far in accusing an Evergreen, Colo., couple of
anti-Semitism. The main evidence in the case turned out to be
illegally recorded telephone conversations.
</P>
<P>
   William and Dorothy Quigley and Mitchell and Candace Aronson had
been neighbors and friends in the upscale mountain community of
Evergreen, 15 miles west of Denver. Their children played together.
But then the Aronson's large dog allegedly attacked the Quigleys'
smaller dog, and a feud followed.
</P>
<P>
   After a 1994 incident in which William Quigley drove toward Mrs.
Aronson and swerved at the last moment, he pleaded no contest to
reckless driving.
</P>
<P>
   The Aronsons found they could pick up the Quigleys'
cordless-phone conversations on their police scanner, then followed
advice from local authorities to tape calls they felt were
threatening.
</P>
<P>
   During one call, Mrs. Quigley said she had considered painting
an oven door on the Aronsons' home. And the Aronsons said a
reference to Nazi death camps terrified them.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Horowitz, a lawyer for the Quigleys, called the remarks
''banter.''
</P>
<P>
   In her trial testimony, Mrs. Quigley said her telephone comments
were ''sick'' and that she regretted them.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Saul F. Rosenthal, director of ADL's Mountain States
region, held a news conference accusing the Quigleys of
anti-Semitism. He based his remarks on the taped conversations.
</P>
<P>
   But the jury concluded those statements at the news conference --
and on the radio -- were defamatory and ''not substantially true.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the Quigleys pointed out the recordings, which local
prosecutors had urged, were illegal. A federal law, passed shortly
after the two families began feuding, banned the recording of
cordless phone conversations.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson County District Attorney Dave Thomas subsequently
apologized to the Quigleys for filing hate crime charges against
them, and his office paid $75,000 to settle a lawsuit. The Quigleys
also got a $350,000 settlement from the two lawyers who initially
represented the Aronsons. The Aronsons, now divorced, moved out of
the neighborhood two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the Quigleys refused to comment and responded to the
ADL filing its appeal on Friday by asking U.S. District Judge
Edward Nottingham to triple the damage award. The judge took the
motions under advisement.

<HEADLINE> Ducklings Rescued in England  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- A family of ducks caused a flap at Parliament on
Saturday when seven ducklings fell down a ventilation shaft into
the Underground subway, halting trains briefly and bringing
firefighters to the rescue.
</P>
<P>
   The drama began when a mother duck set off across the House of
Commons courtyard with seven young waddling in her wake. Crossing
the grill of an Underground ventilation shaft, the ducklings
slipped through the cracks, the London Fire Brigade said.
</P>
<P>
   The mother duck quacked frantically on the cobbled stones of the
Carriage Gate entrance to Parliament, and six firefighters rushed
to the scene.
</P>
<P>
   A House of Commons window cleaner lowered himself into
ventilation shaft, and found that three of the ducklings had died
in the 75-foot fall, fireman Graham Barber said
</P>
<P>
   But the four survivors wandered onto a subway platform at
Westminster station, where trains were brought briefly to a
standstill as animal protection officials rounded the ducklings up.
</P>
<P>
   ''The survivors are quite healthy,'' said animal ambulance
driver Roy Blackburn. ''Apparently ducks have been living in the
House of Commons for 20 years.''
</P>
<P>
   During the drama, the mother duck disappeared. Rescuers said the
surviving ducklings would be cared for at Egham Swan Center in
Surrey.
</P>
<P>
   A parliamentary observer said that members of Parliament often
brought in dry bread for the ducks ''like kindergarten children,''
and would mourn their passing.

<HEADLINE> Stasi Files Taken From Journalist  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- German authorities have confiscated thousands of
East German spy agency bugging records that had been secretly kept
by a journalist, the federal prosecutors' office said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Der Spiegel newsmagazine reported that the files from the
so-called Stasi contained the results of phone taps and other
electronic surveillance on West German politicians, including
now-Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder. The 20,000 pages were the largest
stash of Stasi files in private hands, the magazine said.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors are investigating possible charges of revealing
state secrets against Paul Limbach, a Bonn-based journalist who is
an editor at Focus newsmagazine, spokeswoman Eva Schuebel said.
</P>
<P>
   The files had been confiscated last Wednesday, Schuebel said.
She said after a search turned up some of the files, Limbach handed
over the rest.
</P>
<P>
   Limbach told Der Spiegel he had given ex-Chancellor Helmut Kohl
the files that related to him in 1990. However, Kohl told the
magazine that he could not recall ever seeing the records.
</P>
<P>
   Stasi files on former West German politicians have figured into
the scandal around Kohl's Christian Democratic party over its
illegal financial practices.
</P>
<P>
   A parliament committee investigating bribery charges during his
16 years in power has decided it won't use Stasi files as evidence.
But lawmakers say they will still ask witnesses questions based on
media reports about the files.
</P>
<P>
   Some speculate the files could reveal Kohl had knowledge about
the system of off-the-books payoffs and secret accounts run by his
party, something he has vehemently denied.
</P>
<P>
   A federal agency based in the same Berlin building that was
Stasi headquarters is now in charge of the files, and those who
were the target of the Stasi's spying can request to see their own
files. The head of the agency has said Kohl will get no special
treatment on his request to see his files.
</P>
<P>
   Limbach had received the files from Stasi officers that went to
work for the German counter-intelligence agency after the two
Germanys were reunited in 1990, Der Spiegel said.

<HEADLINE> Golden Missile Wins Pimlico Special  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GINSBURG
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE (AP) -- Golden Missile took the lead at the top of the
stretch and jockey Kent Desormeaux guided him home for a surprise
victory in the $750,000 Pimlico Special on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   In beating a talented field of older horses, including Lemon
Drop Kid and Cat Thief, Golden Missile stayed just off the pace
before moving past Pleasant Breeze and winning by two lengths.
</P>
<P>
   Lemon Drop Kid, who won the 1999 Belmont Stakes and the Travers,
was third, followed by Almutawakel, Cat Thief, favored K One King,
Budroyale and Allen's Oop.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was quite confident all the way around,'' Desormeaux, who
won the Kentucky Derby last Saturday aboard Fusaichi Pegasus, said.
''He made the lead without being asked, and when I asked him to run
he just exploded.''
</P>
<P>
   Golden Missile, a 5-year-old chestnut colt, earned $450,000 for
the win. He covered the 1 3/16 miles at Pimlico in 1:54 3-5, and
paid $11.40, $7.20 and $4.60.
</P>
<P>
   Pleasant Breeze paid $23 and $13, and Lemon Drop Kid returned
$4.40 to show.
</P>
<P>
   Cat Thief, trained by D. Wayne Lukas, rattled the gate open
before the race. Once the gates opened for good, the colt grabbed
the lead and held onto it until Golden Missile blew past him at the
top of the stretch. Cat Thief faded to fifth.
</P>
<P>
   The race featured several participants in last month's Oaklawn
Handicap, when K One King defeated Almutawakel, Cat Thief,
Budroyale, Allen's Oop and Pleasant Breeze. The addition of the
talented Lemon Drop Kid, as well as Golden Missile, only enhanced
the field.
</P>
<P>
   Lemon Drop Kid, with new jockey Edgar Prado aboard, was forced
to the outside early but still had a shot before Golden Missile
made his move.
</P>
<P>
   Lemon Drop Kid carried a highweight of 120 pounds. The betting
favorite in the morning line, he went off as the second-favorite.

<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- A 20-year-old Hartford man has been
sentenced to 2 1/2 years in prison for a beating that resulted in
the death of a Trinity College freshman last fall.
</P>
<P>
   Alfredo Galvez was sentenced Friday in Hartford Superior Court.
He had entered a plea to 2nd degree manslaughter under the Alfred
doctrine, which means he did not admit guilt but conceded the state
had enough evidence to win a conviction.
</P>
<P>
   Herme ''John'' Ortiz, 17. of the Bronx, N.Y., died a week after
the fight last September at a campus party.
</P>
<P>
   Galvez punched Ortiz twice in the face after an argument,
witnesses said. Ortiz fell, hitting his head on the sidewalk.
</P>
<P>
   Galvez was an invited guest on campus, but not a Trinity
student, college officials said.

<HEADLINE> Magazine Challenges No Gun Ri Story  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   U.S. News &AMP; World Report on Saturday challenged
accounts of
three U.S. veterans who told The Associated Press that they
witnessed the killing of civilians by American soldiers in the
early days of the Korean War.
<TEXT>
<P>
   AP said it stood behind its story, and The New York Times
reported that Army investigators have confirmed the central finding
that U.S. troops killed hundreds of refugees in July 1950 near the
hamlet of No Gun Ri.
</P>
<P>
   Two historians, meanwhile, told The Washington Post that they
believed that a mass killing had occurred as reported by AP last
fall.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. News asserted it had obtained new information raising
doubts about whether three of the soldiers who described the
killings at No Gun Ri were actually present. Other soldiers, U.S.
News said, claimed their statements had been misconstrued.
</P>
<P>
   In its story, AP quoted a dozen U.S. veterans as saying at least
100 South Koreans, many of them women and children, were shot to
death under a railroad bridge at No Gun Ri. In important respects,
their accounts matched the claims of Korean survivors, who
estimated as many as 300 civilians were shot to death following an
aerial strafing in which 100 others died.
</P>
<P>
   The story was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for investigative
journalism and other top awards.
</P>
<P>
   Executive editor Jonathan Wolman said AP stands by its account.
</P>
<P>
   ''The story of No Gun Ri is a complicated and important one, and
we've always felt it deserves full scrutiny,'' he said. ''Our story
was based on many interviews and material from military archives,
and we're confident the central information will be borne out by
investigators.''
</P>
<P>
   In its report Saturday, The New York Times quoted unidentified
Defense Department officials as saying that Army investigators have
confirmed the central element of the AP report that American troops
fired on refugees resulting in what the Pentagon called ''the
tragic death of hundreds of civilians.''
</P>
<P>
   The episode occurred as refugees approached U.S. lines near the
village of No Gun Ri in the fifth week of the Korean War.
</P>
<P>
   The AP was making public additional details Saturday from its
reporting in responding to suggestions in U.S. News that the
presence at No Gun Ri of ex-GI eyewitnesses Delos Flint and Eugene
Hesselman was questionable.
</P>
<P>
   The new material, given to U.S. News by the AP but omitted from
the magazine's article, concerns the dates on which two veterans --
Flint of Clio, Mich., and Hesselman of Fort Mitchell, Ky. -- were
wounded in July 1950.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine said the 7th Cavalry Regiment's ''war diary''
reported Flint was wounded and evacuated on July 25, the day before
the No Gun Ri killings began. He could not have witnessed the
bloodshed, it said.
</P>
<P>
   Although that document says he was wounded that day, it does not
say he was evacuated, the AP noted. Moreover, the usually reliable
company ''morning reports'' show that Flint was wounded, and
apparently evacuated, the next day, July 26, the day of the
killings. Flint has graphic memories of that day, when he told the
AP he rejected orders to fire on ''civilians just trying to hide.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. News also said Hesselman was wounded and evacuated before
the No Gun Ri shootings. But his company's morning report shows he
also was wounded on July 26, the day of the killings, when he says
he was lightly wounded by shrapnel, had his hand bandaged and
declined medical evacuation.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the AP noted, the regimental diary lists Hesselman as
wounded on yet another day, July 28, further confounding any effort
50 years later to find a definitive timeline from paperwork
compiled in the chaos of war.
</P>
<P>
   Hesselman, like Flint and other veterans, spontaneously
recounted details and vivid images from the No Gun Ri episode when
first contacted by the AP.
</P>
<P>
   In investigating the No Gun Ri allegations, AP's research first
pinpointed which U.S. units were in the area, and its reporters
then traced veterans of those units, contacting them independently
and without notice. Some, including Hesselman, said they had not
talked with veterans of their units since the war.
</P>
<P>
   At least a dozen confirmed that a large number of civilians were
killed at No Gun Ri. Still other ex-GIs spoke more vaguely about
civilians being shot around that time and place. Many were shown
photos and confirmed the location.
</P>
<P>
   The record of a third veteran quoted by the AP, Edward L. Daily
of Clarksville, Tenn., is gaining the closest scrutiny. Daily was
also quoted by U.S. News in an October 1999 article.
</P>
<P>
   Daily's personnel file was destroyed in a records-center fire in
1973. According to the sketchy record reconstructed by the U.S.
military, he was not in a 7th Cavalry Regiment company at No Gun
Ri, as he says he was, but in a maintenance company miles to the
rear.
</P>
<P>
   Daily has shown an AP reporter documents, including a worn old
Army driver's license, in support of his contention he was in the
7th Cavalry's H Company in July 1950. In addition, several veterans
referred to Daily's presence in their AP interviews, including one
who drew a diagram of where Daily's foxhole was in relation to his
own.
</P>
<P>
   The reassembled, partial record also indicates Daily did not
receive a battlefield commission as a lieutenant, as he says he
did, and it does not list the decorations for valor he displays in
his home.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington Post quoted West Point history instructor Maj.
Robert Bateman, as saying he has documents showing that Daily, who
claims to have machine-gunned refugees gathered in a railroad
culvert, was not at the scene of the killings. In an e-mail, the
Post said, Bateman said, ''It turns out that the AP team fell for
the biggest fake combat veteran extant.''
</P>
<P>
   Other historians, however, disagreed with Bateman about the
significance of the latest reports. The Post quoted Allan Millett,
an Ohio State University historian who is supervising Bateman's
doctoral dissertation, as saying Bateman was ''too quick to jump
from Daily being a fraud to the idea that nothing happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Cumings, a University of Chicago expert who has written
books on the Korean war, was quoted by the Post as saying he was
''quite sure a major massacre happened there, whether or not an
individual soldier got an order to fire.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon has made no final public judgment on Daily's
credibility.
</P>
<P>
   Even if his No Gun Ri account proves unfounded, ''it doesn't
change the review, which is intended to find out what happened,''
Army spokesman Maj. Tom Collins told the Baltimore Sun. ''Daily or
whoever else is just a small part of a very large picture.''

   HOUSTON (AP) -- Ken Griffey Jr. hit two home runs, including a
two-out, two-run shot in the ninth inning Saturday that gave the
Cincinnati Reds their sixth straight victory, 8-7 over the Houston
Astros.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Tucker, Griffey and Dmitri Young hit consecutive homers
in the eighth that tied it at 6. Houston took the lead in the
bottom half on Richard Hidalgo's RBI double.
</P>
<P>
   Astros closer Billy Wagner got two quick outs in the ninth
before walking pinch-hitter Dante Bichette. Griffey connected on an
0-2 pitch, hitting a drive into the right-field seats for his 12th
home run.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey, who entered the game hitting .176 (6-for-34) during
May, also had a run-scoring double and finished with four RBIs. It
was his 42nd career multihomer game.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros loaded the bases with one out in the ninth before
Scott Williamson got pinch-hitter Russ Johnson to ground into a
game-ending double play.
</P>
<P>
   Dennys Reyes (1-1) was the winner and Williamson got his fifth
save. Wagner (1-2) blew a save chance for the second straight day.
</P>
<P>
   Hidalgo, Roger Cedeno and Daryle Ward homered for the Astros.
There have been 64 home runs in 17 games at new Enron Field.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros took a 6-2 lead into the eighth. Tucker hit a two-run
shot off Jay Powell, then reliever Yorkis Perez gave up home runs
to Griffey and Young on consecutive pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Cedeno's homer capped a five-run seventh. Hidalgo's solo shot
tied it at 2 and Mitch Meluskey drew a walk from Osvaldo Fernandez
and scored on Bill Spiers' double.
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez, called up from Double-A Chattanooga on Saturday to
replace the injured Pete Harnisch, allowed four runs on six hits in
6 1-3. He made his first major league appearance since June 25,
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey hit an RBI double in the sixth, stole third and scored
on Sean Casey's single for a 2-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros took a 1-0 lead in the second when Ward homered.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Young's first-inning single gave the Reds left fielder a
career-high 18-game hitting streak. ... Jeff Bagwell is hitting
.059 (1-for-17) on the homestand. ... The last time the Reds hit
three consecutive homers was April 9, 1997 at Colorado when Barry
Larkin, Willie Greene and Reggie Sanders did it.

<HEADLINE> Inmate from Upstate Correctional Facility dies after fight with cellmate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MALONE, N.Y. (AP) -- A fight over a fluorescent reading light in
a maximum-security prison cell Friday ended in the death of a
42-year-old inmate, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The name of the deceased inmate, pronounced dead at Albany
Medical Center at 2:30 p.m., was being withheld Saturday pending
notification of family members in Panama. He was serving an
indeterminate sentence of 18 years-to-life for a conviction in
Brooklyn for second-degree murder and drug sale charges.
</P>
<P>
   According to a news release from the state Department of
Correctional Services, a correction officer making rounds at
Upstate Correctional Facility discovered two cellmates fighting at
3:10 a.m. Friday.
</P>
<P>
   After inmate Donnell Brunson, 34, was removed from the cell,
five officers and two nurses transported the injured cellmate by
gurney to the facility's infirmary. He was brought to Alice Hyde
Hospital in Malone, then transported to Albany Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   Brunson was placed in restraints without incident and
transferred to the disciplinary housing unit at Clinton
Correctional Facility in Dannemora, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   State Police and Department of Correctional Services
investigators say the fight appears to be over Brunson's turning on
an inmate-controlled fluorescent light that his cellmate wanted
left off. No weapons were found in the cell, and it is suspected
Brunson assaulted his cellmate using his fists and feet. The
cellmate sustained head injuries when Brunson allegedly grabbed him
by the hair and rapidly beat his head against the cell wall.
</P>
<P>
   Possible additional criminal counts as well as administrative
charges against Donnell are pending investigation, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Correction officials said the incident was the first potential
inmate-on-inmate homicide at the 1,500-bed facility since it opened
about a year ago. The last inmate homicide was in 1998, at the
Wyoming Correctional Facility in Attica.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a fact of prison life that violence will occur among
inmates who choose to misbehave, but our policies at Upstate keep
those attacks to a minimum, despite this incident,'' Department of
Correctional Services Commissioner Glenn S. Goord said.
</P>
<P>
   Inmates are sent to Upstate for an average of four months to
serve disciplinary sentences imposed for misbehavior at other
prisons.
</P>
<P>
   Upstate double cells 1,200 inmates around the clock, with
out-of-cell time limited to medical, family and legal visits plus
one to three hours of outdoor exercise time daily, depending on
inmate conduct. The remaining 300 inmates are classified
non-disciplinary, and are let out of their cells daily for various
work assignments.
</P>
<P>
   DOCS officials say that Upstate and other disciplinary housing
units allow the state to remove more disruptive inmates from other
prisons.
</P>
<P>
   Both inmates had earned ''Level 3'' status that restored most of
their property and privileges and meant their release back to other
facilities was approaching.
</P>
<P>
   Brunson was serving a nine-year determinate sentence for an
Oneida County robbery conviction with a conditional release date of
July 8, 2003 and a maximum sentence expiring October 22, 2004. He
was being housed at n Wyoming Correctional Facility in Attica when
he received a 295-day disciplinary sentence for drug use. His
cellmate was serving a 21-month disciplinary sentence for creating
a disturbance, disorderly conduct and fighting with other inmates
at Mid-State correctional facility.
</P>
<P>
   The state began double-celling inmates in 1995 in response to a
growing overcrowding problem. The state's prison guard union argued
at the time that double celling would increase the odds of inmates
becoming more violent toward each other and toward corrections
officers and would raise the chances of diseases spreading.
</P>
<P>
   DOCs officials say statistics show a drop in inmate-to-inmate
assaults in recent years -- from 27 incidents per 1,000 inmates in
1987 to 14 per 1,000 inmates in 1999. Inmate-on-staff assaults
during the same period went from 14 to 10 such incidents per 1,000
inmates.

<HEADLINE> U.S. To Resume Visas in Guyana  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) -- The U.S. Embassy in Guyana will resume
processing nonimmigrant visas on Monday, nearly two months after it
uncovered a $1.8 million scam to sell the travel documents.
</P>
<P>
   The embassy announced in a statement Friday night that the State
Department had approved the resumption of processing visas in the
South American country. It had stopped issuing them shortly after
the March 17 arrests of former embassy official Thomas P. Carroll
of Chicago and local businessman Halim Khan.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll, who is being held in Chicago, has denied the charges.
Khan, a businessman accused of serving as a middleman, has also
denied any involvement in the scheme. He is being held in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Airlines have been given the names of people suspected of
purchasing visas during the period under investigation and asked to
bar those people from boarding U.S.-bound flights. Dozens of
Guyanese have been interviewed so far by investigators and at least
three local embassy employees have been fired.

<HEADLINE> Love, Huston Tied At Nelson Classic  </HEADLINE>
By DOUG FERGUSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas (AP) -- The wind changed, and so did the fortunes
of Davis Love III in the Byron Nelson Classic.
</P>
<P>
   Love lost his four-stroke lead and had to scramble for a 1-over
71 to regain a share of the lead with John Huston on Saturday. In
the process, he brought a bunch of other players back into the
picture -- perhaps even Tiger Woods and David Duval.
</P>
<P>
   After struggling all day to gauge a strong wind that came from
the opposite direction, Love made birdie from the bunker on the
par-5 16th and finished at 10-under 200 with Huston, who had a
3-under 67 on another tough day for scoring.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hit it just as good,'' Love said. ''I just didn't hit the
right club three or four times. You start second-guessing yourself.
I lost some confidence because I got surprised.''
</P>
<P>
   Jesper Parnevik, trying to win for the second time this year,
had a 68 and was three strokes back. Phil Mickelson also had a 68
and was at 206.
</P>
<P>
   ''Phil and Jesper are right where they wanted to be -- three or
four back, which is well within reach,'' Love said. ''And John did
what he wanted to do -- catch up. It should be a good race.''
</P>
<P>
   Three Texans -- Mark Brooks, Paul Stankowski and Bob Estes -- were
at 205.
</P>
<P>
   Woods and Duval, the top two players in the world ranking, were
at 203 and will be paired alone together in the final round for the
first time in their career.
</P>
<P>
   ''Each day, I've felt better,'' said Woods, who birdied two of
the last three holes for his second straight 3-under 67. ''I hate
to say it, but it feels like I'm getting my competitive edge
back.''
</P>
<P>
   Duval, who had a 68, and Woods were in a threesome in the final
round of the Nissan Open, although neither made a run. That might
be the case again Sunday, depending on Love and Huston, and the
Texas wind that made the TPC at Las Colinas play entirely different
than the first two rounds.
</P>
<P>
   Parnevik hit a wedge into the 490-yard third hole with gusts
behind him. On Saturday, he had to rip a 5-wood just to reach the
green.
</P>
<P>
   ''The course played a lot tougher in this wind,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he liked his chances a lot better at the end of a
blustery day.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's nice to have only two guys in front of you,'' he said.
''When it's like that, anybody can win.''
</P>
<P>
   Love could have changed all that. His four-stroke lead after
Friday was largest in tournament history after two rounds, and he
kept that cushion until the wind started playing tricks on him.
</P>
<P>
   Love had only two decent birdie chances on the front nine, and
most of the time had to made 4- and 6-footers just to save par.
Huston didn't hit the ball nearly as well as Love off the tee -- or
as long -- but he gave himself more birdie opportunities and
converted.
</P>
<P>
   Love finally lost his lead on No. 14. He was 170 yards from the
hole and selected an 8-iron, turning to his caddie to say, ''At
least I can't fly this green.''
</P>
<P>
   Wrong.
</P>
<P>
   It sailed some 30 yards over, behind a cluster of flowers. Love
chipped up the hill and over the green and made a nice chip for
bogey. But Huston holed an 8-footer for birdie and a two-shot
swing.
</P>
<P>
   Huston had only one such problem, blasting out of the rough on
the par-5 16th and causing the gallery to scatter like birds. He
had to settle for par on the easiest hole on the course, while Love
got up-and-down from the bunker to forge a tie.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was nothing I could about Davis. I had to stick to my
game plan,'' said Huston, whose last victory was the Disney Classic
in 1998. ''I'm very satisfied.''
</P>
<P>
   DIVOTS: Davis Love III printed a ''45'' on the back of his hat
as a tribute to Adam Petty, the NASCAR driver who was killed in a
crash Friday in New Hampshire. Love went to college in North
Carolina and knows several members of the Petty family ... Hank
Kuehne, the former U.S. Amateur champion who failed to even get his
card for the Buy.com Tour, had a bogey-free round of 64 despite
missing a half-dozen putts inside 12 feet. ... Love has missed only
one fairway each of the past two days. ... Stankowski eagle on
554-yard 16th with a 350-yard drive -- slightly longer than Woods'
drive -- and a 9-iron into the green. ''I really didn't care if I
made eagle,'' he said. ''I'm just glad I hit it by Tiger. That was
fun.''

<HEADLINE> Lakers' O'Neal Dominates Phoenix  </HEADLINE>
By BOB BAUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX (AP) -- After being swept out of the NBA playoffs the
last two seasons, the Los Angeles Lakers could be doing the
sweeping this time.
</P>
<P>
   The steady leadership of Phil Jackson, the spectacular ability
of Kobe Bryant and the performance of the role players all have
helped the Lakers to a 3-0 lead over Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   But the Lakers are leading the Western Conference semifinals
mainly for one 7-foot-1, 325-pound reason. Shaquille O'Neal has
been just too much for the Suns.
</P>
<P>
   In the series, O'Neal has averaged 37.3 points and 17 rebounds.
Even the ''Hack-A-Shaq'' tactics backfired in Friday night's 105-99
victory, with O'Neal shooting 9-of-15 from the line. He's shooting
58 percent from the field (45-for-77), and his baskets haven't all
been point-black stuffs.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not like he's taking us down in the post and bullying us.
It's not that,'' the Suns' Luc Longley said. ''It's his overall
game, and that's the difference between two or three years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Lakers, 7-0 against Phoenix this season, win Game 4 on
Sunday, they will complete their first playoff sweep since 1991 and
their first sweep of a four-game series since 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've made a lot of progress,'' O'Neal said Saturday. ''Coach
Jackson has done a good job of keeping us together, keeping us out
of trouble and keeping us very focused. We're looking to close it
down tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Suns coach Scott Skiles said O'Neal's expanded repertoire of
offensive moves has compounded the difficulty in defending him.
</P>
<P>
   ''It sounds crazy to say,'' Skiles said, ''but I think we're
doing a good job on the guy.''
</P>
<P>
   After close losses in Games 2 and 3, Phoenix faced the prospect
of going into Game 4 without Cliff Robinson, who sprained his right
ankle when he stepped on O'Neal's foot late in the third quarter
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I had to play today, I probably couldn't,'' Robinson said.
''I'd just be hobbling around. We'll see tomorrow after I ice it
and treat it.''
</P>
<P>
   Skiles believes free-throw shooting, not O'Neal, has been the
difference in the series. The Lakers are 72-for-105 at the line,
including 35-for-51 Friday night. The Suns are 60-for-83.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're making more free throws than we're shooting,'' Skiles
said, a slight exaggeration. ''Every other statistic is right on
the line. It's been the same thing for us all year long. We shoot
the fewest free throws of any team in the playoffs, 22 a game.''
</P>
<P>
   To what does he attribute the disparity?
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know. I'll leave that to other people,'' Skiles said.
''I'm simply stating a fact.''
</P>
<P>
   Skiles was asked if he'd called league officials to complain
about the officiating.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't really want to get into that,'' he said, ''because the
next question will be 'What did I say?'''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said there are many reasons for the free-throw
discrepancy, mainly the fact the Suns have chosen to foul O'Neal
often.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have Shaquille and people want to foul Shaquille,'' Jackson
said. ''When that ends up happening, then it becomes an issue
because the end result is you get in the foul penalty early, then
the fouls you make against Glen Rice or Robert Horry or Kobe,
you've got them going to the line in the penalty.''
</P>
<P>
   The Suns' Penny Hardaway has averaged 27.7 points and shot 58
percent from the field in the series, a performance that has
restored a reputation tainted by his troubled final seasons in
Orlando. But he said his individual efforts are no consolation.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're still down 3-0,'' he said. ''I don't care how many
points I score as long as we win.''
</P>
<P>
   Jason Kidd, shooting just 29 percent in the series as he tries
to come back from a broken ankle, said that the team's experiences
this season guarantees they won't roll over in Game 4.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everything that we've been through, the injuries, the coaching
change. There's not one team in this league that's been through as
much as we have that's been successful,'' Kidd said. ''We're not
going to give up. We could have thrown in the towel a long time
ago, but we're going to keep on fighting.''

<HEADLINE> Arbitrator: Sanders To Repay Lions  </HEADLINE>
By JIM SUHR
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- An arbitrator has ruled that Barry Sanders must
repay the Detroit Lions $1.83 million of his signing bonus in July,
a bit longer than his former team had hoped.
</P>
<P>
   But arbitrator Sam Kagel's clarification last week still doesn't
have the retired running back and the Lions on the same page about
the exact deadline for Sanders to hand over any check.
</P>
<P>
   Lions spokesman Bill Keenist said Saturday the club interprets
Kagel's clarification as meaning the money is due July 19, if
Sanders doesn't report that day to training camp. Sanders agent
David Ware says his client has until July 29.
</P>
<P>
   It's a disagreement about just 10 days, but neither side in what
has become an acrimonious dispute is giving ground.
</P>
<P>
   ''Paying the bonus back has never been a problem,'' Ware said.
''We offered to pay the bonus back last year in exchange for his
release, and the Lions refused.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanders got an $11 million signing bonus when he signed a
six-year contract with the Lions in 1997. He played just two years
before startling the NFL by leaving football on the eve of last
summer's training camp, just 1,458 yards shy of breaking Walter
Payton's NFL career record of 16,726.
</P>
<P>
   Kagel ruled in February that if Sanders stayed retired, Sanders
must pay back one-sixth of the signing bonus for each year he fails
to play under the contract's terms.
</P>
<P>
   Though Sanders later repaid the Lions $83,333 -- the balance of
his prorated 1999 signing bonus -- Ware said the Lions in a March 3
letter demanded payment by March 13 of the $1.83 million that Kagel
ruled the player owes the club this season, if he doesn't play.
</P>
<P>
   To the Lions, the intent of Kagel's February ruling gave them
the right to collect the money 10 days after the club first
announced that training camp will open July 19.
</P>
<P>
   When Ware countered that Kagel never intended that, both sides
requested the Kagel clarification handed down last week.
</P>
<P>
   ''According to this ruling,'' Keenist said, ''either Barry shows
up for the first day of camp or pays the prorated portion of the
signing bonus for the 2000 season.''
</P>
<P>
   To Ware, Kagel's intentions are ''pretty clear'': Sanders has
until 10 days after the camp's start to either report or pay.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no basis for an earlier demand for payment,'' Ware
said. ''If they want it earlier, they can get it as long as they
release him.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Ware said, ''they've told us they're not going to trade him
or release him.''

<HEADLINE> ANC To Help With Zimbabwe Elections  </HEADLINE>
By RAVI NESSMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) -- President Thabo Mbeki said
Saturday his African National Congress party has sent a delegation
to Zimbabwe to work with the ruling party and the opposition to
ensure that coming parliamentary elections are free and fair.
</P>
<P>
   In a wide-ranging interview with foreign journalists a week
ahead of his first state visit to Washington, Mbeki talked about
investment in Africa, his controversial stance on AIDS and the
crisis in Zimbabwe, where at least 18 people have been killed in
recent political violence.
</P>
<P>
   An ANC delegation was sent to Zimbabwe this weekend to hear the
opposition's concerns and to present them to the ruling party in an
effort to find a way to hold fair elections, Mbeki said.
International election monitors must also be part of the equation,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We should try and encourage as many people as possible --
organizations, institutions -- to send observers to Zimbabwe as
early as possible ... to observe all elements of the election
process,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mbeki has shied away from criticizing Zimbabwean President
Robert Mugabe, whom the opposition blames for sparking the violence
and the occupations of white-owned farms in order to gain support
for his party -- and to intimidate the opposition -- ahead of the
elections.
</P>
<P>
   Mbeki has focused his public statements about Zimbabwe on the
importance of land reform in a country where a handful of whites
own one-third of the productive farmland.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Mbeki said he had told Mugabe privately that the
violence must end, the rule of law must be restored and free and
fair elections must be conducted. In return, he would mediate with
Britain -- Zimbabwe's former colonial master -- and international
institutions to ensure Zimbabwe gets the funds to embark on a
meaningful program of land reform.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is our neighbor. We have to live with the Zimbabweans
forever here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Zimbabwe's main opposition Movement for Democratic Change has
said fair elections will be impossible after months of violent
intimidation by militant members of Mugabe's ruling party. The
party announced Saturday it would begin a campaign of strikes and
civil disobedience to protest the violence.
</P>
<P>
   Mbeki is expected to be dogged with questions about his AIDS
policies during his visit to the United States, which begins May
22. He leaves the on May 26.
</P>
<P>
   In a country where an estimated 4 million people are infected
with HIV, the government has refused to finance a program to treat
pregnant mothers with the medicine AZT, which many AIDS researchers
believe greatly reduces the chances the virus will be transmitted
to the baby in childbirth.
</P>
<P>
   Mbeki has convened a panel of scientists, many of them on the
fringe of AIDS research, to discuss the efficacy of accepted AIDS
treatments and whether HIV causes AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are real, genuine scientific questions recognized by the
scientists ... and they've set up a forum so that they do address
these problems,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mbeki also worried that many businesses were scared to invest
money in a continent where violent conflicts tend to overshadow
positive developments.
</P>
<P>
   Mbeki advocated developing an early warning system in Africa to
alert other countries in the region to brewing conflicts before
they develop into full-blown violence.

   NEW YORK (AP) -- U.S. News &AMP; World Report today challenged accounts of three
U.S. veterans who told The Associated Press that they witnessed the killing of
civilians by American soldiers in the early days of the Korean War. AP said it
stood behind its story, and The New York Times reported that Army investigators
have confirmed the central finding that U.S. troops killed hundreds of refugees
in July 1950 near the hamlet of No Gun Ri. Two historians, meanwhile, told The
Washington Post that they believed that a mass killing had occurred as reported

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Mayor Rudolph Giuliani stepped out of the spotlight today,
canceling a campaign appearance and spending much of the day mulling his medical
options as uncertainty hung over his Senate campaign. His campaign manager said
that as of today Giuliani had not made a decision about whether to proceed with
the campaign and wouldn't do so until he had more time to consider his medical
treatment for prostate cancer. An announcement about whether the mayor plans to
stay in the race against first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton could come as soon as
tomorrow or Monday, according to a person knowledgeable about Giuliani's

peace negotiators to miss another deadline for the outlines of a final treaty.
Demonstrations demanding the release of some 1,600 Palestinians held in Israeli
jails were slated to continue tomorrow, even as negotiators were scheduled to
meet in Jerusalem in an effort to discuss the issue.

N.M. Fire Looking Beatable

   LOS ALAMOS, N.M. (AP) -- More than a week after the National Park Service
started a blaze to remove dry brush and grass, the fire that has destroyed 260
homes and threatened the Los Alamos National Laboratory is no longer looking
invincible, and Los Alamos is beginning to come to grips with the scale of its
destruction. Most of the 25,000 people evacuated will not be allowed to return
to their homes for at least a week, although the National Guard will begin
escorting groups into Los Alamos as early as tomorrow to pick up clothes,
medicine and other essentials.

Blaze Remains Near Grand Canyon

<P>
   GRAND CANYON NATIONAL PARK, Ariz. (AP) -- More firefighting resources and
sustained calmer winds helped to prevent a 7,000-acre wildfire from spreading,
authorities said today. The size of the fire had not increased since yesterday,
when calmer winds gave firefighters a break after a blustery Wednesday and
Thursday. ''That finally gave firefighters a chance to get in there and fight
it,'' said Grand Canyon Park spokeswoman Margee Hench. The Outlet fire began
April 25 as a prescribed burn to thin out brush on about 1,500 acres.

76ers Defeat Pacers 92-90

<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The Philadelphia 76ers kept their season alive today
with a 92-90 victory over Indiana in a fight-marred Game 4. The Sixers still
trail 3-1 in the best-of-seven series. Travis Best missed two long jumpers in
the final seconds, including a 3-pointer as time expired that could have ended
the series. The Pacers rallied from an 18-point deficit to lead by five after
Miller and Philadelphia's Matt Geiger were ejected with 1:19 left in the third
quarter. Both are subject to suspensions for the next game Monday.

<HEADLINE> Delegate Selection Angers McCain  </HEADLINE>
By DEE-ANN DURBIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. (AP) -- Arizona Sen. John McCain has canceled
campaign events in Michigan because he feels people loyal to him
were slighted by the state Republican party's delegate election
this weekend, a spokesman said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   McCain had been scheduled to appear at fund-raisers during the
upcoming week for Sen. Spence Abraham and congressional candidates
Chuck Yob and state Sen. Mike Rogers.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain spokesman Todd Harris said McCain is upset about the
party's delegate selection process.
</P>
<P>
   ''What is the point of having an election if party bosses in the
back rooms can ultimately control the outcome?'' Harris said.
</P>
<P>
   Party officials denied they did anything wrong, and insisted
their delegation to the national convention will represent that
McCain won the state's Feb. 22 primary. Under Michigan party rules,
the McCain ''delegates'' won in the primary actually amounted to
blank spaces to be filled in at the party convention.
</P>
<P>
   ''We worked long and hard to make sure this was a united
party,'' Michigan GOP spokesman Sage Eastman said.
</P>
<P>
   The spat comes less than a week after McCain endorsed his former
rival, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, for the presidency, a show of
unity many had said could help repair Michigan's divided party.
</P>
<P>
   Approximately 1,200 Republicans attended the two-day state
convention to elect delegates for the national convention in
Philadelphia this summer. McCain was to attend the convention
Friday, but couldn't due to severe weather.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan has 58 delegates, including three from each of its 16
congressional districts and 10 at-large delegates.
</P>
<P>
   Because McCain won in most of Michigan's congressional districts
in the Feb. 22 primary, he had 52 delegates to six delegates for
Texas Gov. George Bush.
</P>
<P>
   When McCain suspended his campaign in March, he agreed to give
six of his at-large delegates to Bush. But under an agreement
signed by McCain, Gov. John Engler, Michigan Republican Party
Chairman Rusty Hills and state Sen. John Schwarz, R-Battle Creek,
all of McCain's remaining 46 delegate slots were to go to people
who ''worked for the election of John McCain.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, many of the 46 ''McCain delegates'' elected Friday
night actually were longtime Bush supporters, including Hills,
state Senate Majority Leader Dan DeGrow, R-Port Huron, and state
House Speaker Chuck Perricone, R-Kalamazoo.
</P>
<P>
   ''By not keeping their commitment, Governor Engler and chairman
Hills are sending the following message: the Republican party in
Michigan is a closed shop -- reformers and newcomers need not
join,'' said McCain political director John Weaver in a prepared
statement. ''This does not bode well for our party in the general
election in an important battleground state like Michigan.''
</P>
<P>
   Hills, who was elected as a delegate in the 8th congressional
District along with two other Bush supporters, said he should be
elected for the sake of party unity. Three delegates supported by
McCain were elected as alternates for that district.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had a great convention. ... We elected a great slate of
McCain delegates for the convention in Philadelphia,'' said Engler
spokesman John Truscott.
</P>
<P>
   Harris said in the end, only about 15 McCain activists won
seats, even though 46 will be listed, technically, as McCain
delegates at the convention.
</P>
<P>
   ''It doesn't help party unity and it's a slap in the face of
party unity,'' Harris said.
</P>
<P>
   Eastman said he couldn't confirm the number of McCain supporters
who became delegates. ''All along, we didn't really know who the
McCain people were and who the Bush people were,'' Eastman said.
</P>
<P>
   Some convention delegates said they were unaware there had been
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ''We went by the book in the 16th District,'' said Jo Bach, a
McCain volunteer from Carleton who will attend the national
convention as an alternate delegate. ''I'm very proud to be
McCain's delegate. I will vote and campaign for Bush, but McCain
had my vote in the primary.

<HEADLINE> Mariners 6, Athletics 4  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Alex Rodriguez homered and the Seattle
Mariners stopped their longest losing streak of the season at
three, beating the Oakland Athletics 6-4 Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Cameron put the Mariners ahead for good with an RBI double
in the sixth inning and singled home a run in the eighth. Oakland
had won four in a row.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez's two-run homer off Kevin Appier (3-3) in the fifth
gave the Mariners a 4-2 lead. It was his 12th home run of the
season and 160th of his career, tying him with Alvin Davis for
fourth-most in Seattle history.
</P>
<P>
   The two RBIs gave Rodriguez 501 for his career.
</P>
<P>
   Brett Tomko (2-2) went five innings to earn his first win since
April 22. He allowed four runs on seven hits.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Mesa pitched the ninth inning for his first save of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   Appier, who hadn't pitched since April 24 because of a strained
right forearm, lasted 5 2-3 innings. He allowed five runs, three of
them earned, on five hits and four walks. He struck out five.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Stairs and Ben Grieve each singled home a run in the fifth
to tie it at 4.
</P>
<P>
   Jeremy Giambi hit his fourth homer of the season in the second
for the A's. Grieve made it 2-all with an RBI single in the
fourth.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Appier was activated from the 15-day disabled list before
the game. ... Infielder Frank Menechino was sent down to Triple-A
Sacramento of the Pacific Coast League to make room for Appier. ...
A's infielder Olmedo Saenz missed the game with a mild sprain in
his right ankle. He's listed day-to-day. ... Seattle pinch-hitters
are 3-for-19 (.158) with no RBIs. ... The Mariners have lost 179
times to the A's, their most losses against any opponent. ...
Appier's 13 career wins against Seattle are his most against any
club.

<HEADLINE> Barrels of Cyanide Missing in N.J.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Twenty barrels of deadly potassium cyanide were
found Saturday in a New York park, 10 days after they disappeared
from a New Jersey warehouse.
</P>
<P>
   An anonymous 911 call after noon reported the barrels were in
plain view next to a baseball park in a Bronx neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Police immediately evacuated about 75 families. Investigators
wearing protective suits inspected the orange barrels to ensure
they remained sealed, said Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   The barrels were removed about four hours later, and the
families were allowed to return home.
</P>
<P>
   The barrels were located after a trailer went missing May 4 from
a warehouse in Linden, N.J. The shipping container with the drums
of potassium cyanide was destined for Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI confiscated the barrels, but officials cautioned that
the agency is involved because the crime is considered interstate
theft, and not because they suspect terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously the person who stole it, since they were dumped this
way, had no idea what they were taking,'' said Richard J. Sheirer,
the director of the city's Office of Emergency Management.
</P>
<P>
   Potassium cyanide is used in electroplating, a process employed
to make silverware and jewelry, and can be fatal to anyone who
drinks or inhales it. The World Health Organization says potassium
cyanide could be used by terrorists.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Blames Iran for Baghdad Blasts  </HEADLINE>
By WAIEL FALEH
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- Wails of sorrow mixed with calls for
revenge Saturday hours after rockets shook Baghdad in the third
bombardment in less than two months on the heart of the tightly
policed Iraqi capital.
</P>
<P>
   A 3-year-old girl, Zahra Mohammed Hammeed, was killed and four
of her relatives were wounded in the attack, which Iran-based Iraqi
dissidents said targeted the presidential palace.
</P>
<P>
   ''My home, my home is destroyed. My child is dead now. My
brother and I are hurt. Everything is destroyed, what more do you
want?'' said Wafa Kareem Jassim, Zahra's mother.
</P>
<P>
   Two rockets struck homes in the Karadat Mariam district west of
Baghdad at just after midnight, residents said, leaving Jassim's
house a heap of rubble. Several other rockets, they said, exploded
in an open space nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Hussein Mohammed, Zahra's uncle whose home next door was
slightly damaged by another explosion, said the rocket that killed
Zahra landed next to her bed. ''Dust was all over and we could not
see anything at first. Then we found Zahra who was already dead,''
said Mohammed.
</P>
<P>
   Targeting the presidential palace -- about two miles (3.2
kilometers) from where the missiles landed -- made Saturday's attack
the most daring by the Iranian-backed Iraqi dissidents who claimed
responsibility for it.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq issued
statements in London and Syria saying the attack was carried out by
its affiliate, the Iraqi National Islamic Resistance.
</P>
<P>
   In Damascus, the council said assailants fired nine Katyusha
rockets at presidential palace offices ''in retaliation for the
great violations of the Iraqi people by the repressive Iraqi
regime.''
</P>
<P>
   In London, the council's Hamid al-Bayati said five rockets were
fired at the palace and four at a government building nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Odai al-Taie, director general of the state-run Iraqi News
Agency, pointing the finger at Iran, vowed in an interview that
Saturday's strike ''will not pass without punishment.'' He did not
elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, the official Iraqi News Agency quoted an unidentified
Interior Ministry official pledging retaliation: ''The Iraqi
government holds the Iranian regime fully responsible for these
vicious acts.'' Iran will ''pay for these crimes,'' it said.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq and Iran fought an eight-year war that ended with a
U.N.-brokered cease-fire in 1988. The neighbors never signed a
peace treaty and their relations since the end of the war have
remained tense. Each harbors dissident groups fighting the other's
government.
</P>
<P>
   Both governments, however, distance themselves from such attacks
and label them acts of domestic resistance.
</P>
<P>
   On May 1, rockets exploded near the headquarters of Iraq's
General Directorate of Security in Baghdad, wounding eight people.
At about the same time, police headquarters in Tehran, Iran, were
targeted by mortar fire in an attack that wounded six people.
Iranian rebels of the Mujahedeen Khalq -- a group based in Iraq --
claimed responsibility for that attack.
</P>
<P>
   On March 22, a mortar attack on the same area killed four people
and injured 38.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the bombings, more than 1,000 Iranian pilgrims pour into
Iraq every day to pay homage at Shiite Muslim sites in the country.
In the past two months, Iran also has freed 2,479 Iraqi prisoners
captured during the war.
</P>
<P>
   Mistrust lingers with Iraq seeing itself as beleaguered by
hostile neighbors. Its relations are strained with all but Jordan.
Its pleas for rapprochement with Iran have gone unheeded.
</P>
<P>
   According to Baghdad-based diplomats, who spoke on condition
they not be named, Iran has turned down an Iraqi offer to rein in
Iranian exiles on its territory provided that Tehran ends cross
border attacks by Iraqi dissidents on its soil.

<HEADLINE> N.M. Evacuees Glimpse Destruction  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN MacDONALD
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ALAMOS, N.M. (AP) -- Randy Foster tossed an armload of
clothes in his truck, grabbed his dog and fled as the town around
him was about to burn. He left behind his new motorcycle as hot ash
began singeing the back of his neck.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was time to go,'' he said of his hasty departure Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, the Los Alamos police officer returned once again
to what remained of his neighborhood. Walking through his yard in
blue jeans soiled with ash and soot, he found the artifacts of a
life lost: charred metal, blackened rubble and the skeleton of his
bike, most of it melted away in an inferno that has turned 36,000
acres of northern New Mexico into a scorched no man's land.
</P>
<P>
   Most frustrating was what Foster could no longer identify.
</P>
<P>
   He turned over a hunk of fused metal in his hands, blackened by
picking through the debris that was once his living room.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have no idea what this is,'' he said. Then, after a pause,
it came to him. ''Oh, wait a minute, that's my VCR.''
</P>
<P>
   More than a week after the National Park Service started the
blaze to remove dry brush and grass, the fire that had destroyed
260 homes and threatened the Los Alamos National Laboratory
remained dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   The blaze in the nearby canyons and valleys was still only 5
percent contained. It spread in all directions Saturday, reaching
Indian land. Officials were concerned that the fire might reach
sacred tribal sites in the Santa Clara Canyon.
</P>
<P>
   Winds picked up later Saturday, and a dry, cold front was
expected Monday, bringing higher winds.
</P>
<P>
   ''With the fire burning in so many different directions, it will
be a long time before we get this fire contained,'' said Jim Paxon,
a U.S. Forest Service spokesman. ''This fire will burn for weeks.
This thing is growing and we don't know where it's going to end
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the 25,000 people evacuated will not be allowed to
return to their homes for at least a week, although the National
Guard will begin escorting families whose homes were destroyed into
Los Alamos on Sunday. Those visits will be limited: residents
cannot leave the bus, emergency officials said, citing safety
concerns. Most learned of their homes' fate only Friday, when a
list of destroyed houses was posted on the county Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt has promised residents they
will have answers by Thursday about why the National Park Service
started the blaze at Bandelier National Monument. Park
Superintendent Roy Weaver was placed on paid leave pending an
investigation, and Babbitt said all prescribed fires in the West
would be put on hold for a month, although government agencies
could still grant exceptions.
</P>
<P>
   At a Red Cross shelter in Santa Fe, residents waited for word of
the supervised visits.
</P>
<P>
   A few made their way into town, past the checkpoints meant to
keep them out. Others like Foster, whose jobs gave them access,
trickled in to survey the devastation, which could cost $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   White ash dusted the remnants of his two-story condominium like
a light spring snow, and the twisted metal resembled a junkyard
more than the wreckage of a home.
</P>
<P>
   Foster said working 12-hour shifts helped him keep his mind off
the loss but he was still bitter over how feeble he felt in the
face of a fire that seemed relentless.
</P>
<P>
   Faring better was the Los Alamos National Laboratory, a key
facility in the nation's nuclear weapons program that gave rise to
the town.
</P>
<P>
   Some trailers were burned, but the high-security, major
facilities emerged unscathed. The lab planned to resume limited
operations Monday, lab Director John Browne said. In a move
officials described as unprecedented, the lab opened its facility
to reporters Saturday, trying to allay fears that the fire damaged
research and nuclear waste areas.
</P>
<P>
   Months of drought in New Mexico have left the state vulnerable
to outbreaks like the Los Alamos fire. Though the fire season has
just begun, already more than 200,000 acres have burned -- nearly
four times the total for all of last year.
</P>
<P>
   In southern New Mexico, a fire caused by a downed power line
that had charred 20,700 acres lost momentum, and firefighters said
it was 50 percent contained. The fire destroyed 14 buildings and
forced 125 people from their homes in the Sacramento Mountains. The
villages of Sacramento and Weed were evacuated, along with several
nearby canyon enclaves.
</P>
<P>
   Also Saturday, President Clinton declared the area affected by
the Los Alamos fires to be a ''major disaster.'' The announcement
brings federal aid to supplement state and local recovery efforts
as well as financial relief to individuals affected by the blaze.

<HEADLINE> Colorado's Bourque Out With Injury  </HEADLINE>
By JAIME ARON
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- Ray Bourque, whose presence and performance helped
push the Colorado Avalanche into the Western Conference finals,
missed Game 1 against the Dallas Stars on Saturday night because of
a lingering left knee injury.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm just trying to get over the hump,'' Bourque said while his
teammates went through pregame warmups. ''I'm almost there, but I'm
not ready to go tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   He described his status as ''day-by-day,'' adding he hopes to
play in Monday's Game 2. If not, he should be available for Game 3
because it's not until Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Bourque missed the last two games of the second round against
Detroit after being hurt in Game 3. He looked good skating all week
with a brace on his left knee, and even went through a morning
skate Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   But the decision to hold him out was made in the afternoon. He
said Reunion Arena's bad ice was not a factor.
</P>
<P>
   ''I met with the doctor and the trainer,'' Bourque said. ''It's
not 100 percent. I'm skating well, but I have to get over the next
hurdle. I don't want to go out there and get hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   The Avalanche acquired Bourque on March 6 from Boston, where he
had spent his entire 21-year career and established himself as one
of the NHL's best defensemen ever. About the only thing he hadn't
done was win the Stanley Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Bourque's arrival sparked a Colorado revival. Including the
postseason the team is 20-4-1, with victories in 16 of its last 18
outings, since the trade.
</P>
<P>
   The Avalanche have been motivated his personal quest, which also
has made Colorado a sentimental favorite for many.
</P>
<P>
   Bourque has been a big on-ice contributor, too. He has six
assists in his eight playoff games, is a plus-3, and has averaged a
team-best 29 minutes per game.

<HEADLINE> Main No Gun Ri Allegations Backed  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   The New York Times reported Saturday that Army
investigators had
confirmed the central finding of an Associated Press report into
the killing of civilians by U.S. forces during the Korean War, even
as U.S. News &AMP; World Report questioned three U.S. veterans who said
they witnessed the episode.
<TEXT>
<P>
   AP said it stood behind its 1999 story, and two historians told
The Washington Post that they believed a mass killing had occurred.
The Times cited senior Defense officials saying that an Army
investigation ''has confirmed the central element of the (AP)
report'' that American troops fired on refugees near the hamlet of
No Gun Ri during a chaotic period early in the war.
</P>
<P>
   The published reports came after defense officials said the Army
would not complete its review next month as previously scheduled.
Army officials had told reporters they have been unable so far to
determine whether U.S. soldiers were acting under orders when they
fired on civilians at No Gun Ri.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. News asserted it had obtained new information raising
doubts about whether three of the soldiers who described the
killings were actually present at No Gun Ri. Other soldiers, U.S.
News said, claimed their statements had been misconstrued.
</P>
<P>
   In its story, AP quoted a dozen U.S. veterans as saying at least
100 South Koreans, many of them women and children, were shot to
death under a railroad bridge at No Gun Ri. In important respects,
their accounts matched the claims of Korean survivors, who
estimated as many as 300 civilians were shot to death following an
aerial strafing in which 100 others died.
</P>
<P>
   The story was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for investigative
journalism and other top awards.
</P>
<P>
   Executive editor Jonathan Wolman said AP stands by its account.
</P>
<P>
   ''The story of No Gun Ri is a complicated and important one, and
we've always felt it deserves full scrutiny,'' he said. ''Our story
was based on many interviews and material from military archives,
and we're confident the central information will be borne out by
investigators.''
</P>
<P>
   In its report Saturday, The New York Times said Army
investigators had confirmed that American troops fired on refugees
resulting in what the Pentagon called ''the tragic death of
hundreds of civilians.''
</P>
<P>
   The episode occurred as refugees approached U.S. lines near the
village of No Gun Ri in the fifth week of the Korean War.
</P>
<P>
   The AP was making public additional details Saturday from its
reporting in responding to suggestions in U.S. News that the
presence at No Gun Ri of ex-GI eyewitnesses Delos Flint and Eugene
Hesselman was questionable.
</P>
<P>
   The new material, given to U.S. News by the AP but omitted from
the magazine's article, concerns the dates on which two veterans --
Flint of Clio, Mich., and Hesselman of Fort Mitchell, Ky. -- were
wounded in July 1950.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine said the 7th Cavalry Regiment's ''war diary''
reported Flint was wounded and evacuated on July 25, the day before
the No Gun Ri killings began. He could not have witnessed the
bloodshed, it said.
</P>
<P>
   Although that document says he was wounded that day, it does not
say he was evacuated, the AP noted. Moreover, the usually reliable
company ''morning reports'' show that Flint was wounded, and
apparently evacuated, the next day, July 26, the day of the
killings. Flint has graphic memories of that day, when he told the
AP he rejected orders to fire on ''civilians just trying to hide.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. News also said Hesselman was wounded and evacuated before
the No Gun Ri shootings. But his company's morning report shows he
also was wounded on July 26, the day of the killings, when he says
he was lightly wounded by shrapnel, had his hand bandaged and
declined medical evacuation.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the AP noted, the regimental diary lists Hesselman as
wounded on yet another day, July 28, further confounding any effort
50 years later to find a definitive timeline from paperwork
compiled in the chaos of war.
</P>
<P>
   Hesselman, like Flint and other veterans, spontaneously
recounted details and vivid images from the No Gun Ri episode when
first contacted by the AP.
</P>
<P>
   In investigating the No Gun Ri allegations, AP's research first
pinpointed which U.S. units were in the area, and its reporters
then traced veterans of those units, contacting them independently
and without notice. Some, including Hesselman, said they had not
talked with veterans of their units since the war.
</P>
<P>
   At least a dozen confirmed that a large number of civilians were
killed at No Gun Ri. Still other ex-GIs spoke more vaguely about
civilians being shot around that time and place. Many were shown
photos and confirmed the location.
</P>
<P>
   The record of a third veteran quoted by the AP, Edward L. Daily
of Clarksville, Tenn., is gaining the closest scrutiny. Daily was
also quoted by U.S. News in an October 1999 article.
</P>
<P>
   Daily's personnel file was destroyed in a records-center fire in
1973. According to the sketchy record reconstructed by the U.S.
military, he was not in a 7th Cavalry Regiment company at No Gun
Ri, as he says he was, but in a maintenance company miles to the
rear.
</P>
<P>
   Daily has shown an AP reporter documents, including a worn old
Army driver's license, in support of his contention he was in the
7th Cavalry's H Company in July 1950. In addition, several veterans
referred to Daily's presence in their AP interviews, including one
who drew a diagram of where Daily's foxhole was in relation to his
own.
</P>
<P>
   The reassembled, partial record also indicates Daily did not
receive a battlefield commission as a lieutenant, as he says he
did, and it does not list the decorations for valor he displays in
his home.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington Post quoted West Point history instructor Maj.
Robert Bateman, as saying he has documents showing that Daily, who
claims to have machine-gunned refugees gathered in a railroad
culvert, was not at the scene of the killings. In an e-mail, the
Post said, Bateman said, ''It turns out that the AP team fell for
the biggest fake combat veteran extant.''
</P>
<P>
   Other historians, however, disagreed with Bateman about the
significance of the latest reports. The Post quoted Allan Millett,
an Ohio State University historian who is supervising Bateman's
doctoral dissertation, as saying Bateman was ''too quick to jump
from Daily being a fraud to the idea that nothing happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Cumings, a University of Chicago expert who has written
books on the Korean war, was quoted by the Post as saying he was
''quite sure a major massacre happened there, whether or not an
individual soldier got an order to fire.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon has made no final public judgment on Daily's
credibility.
</P>
<P>
   Even if his No Gun Ri account proves unfounded, ''it doesn't
change the review, which is intended to find out what happened,''
Army spokesman Maj. Tom Collins told the Baltimore Sun. ''Daily or
whoever else is just a small part of a very large picture.''

<HEADLINE> Rockies 10, Giants 9  </HEADLINE>
By AARON J. LOPEZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- Barry Bonds hit his 15th home run, but left with a
lower back injury in the ninth inning as the San Francisco Giants
lost 10-9 to the Colorado Rockies on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Bonds, tied for the major league lead in homers, grimaced as he
hit a ground ball to second and got three steps out of the batter's
box before falling to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   He remained flat on his stomach for several minutes before being
taken from the field on the back of a passenger cart.
</P>
<P>
   Giants manager Dusty Baker said Bonds suffered an ''acute lower
back strain.'' His future status was uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   ''No answers,'' Baker said. ''The doctors don't even have any
answers, so how can I have any answers?''
</P>
<P>
   Brian Hunter had three hits and drove in the go-ahead run with
an infield single with two outs in the Rockies eighth.
</P>
<P>
   With the game tied at 9, Giants reliever John Johnstone (2-3)
gave up a bunt single to Neifi Perez and a single to pinch-hitter
Bubba Carpenter before Hunter hit a soft ground ball in the hole
between first and second.
</P>
<P>
   Second baseman Jeff Kent got to the ball but Johnstone dropped
the throw as he and Hunter arrived at the base almost
simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was the right call. I tried to squeeze it and it came
out,'' Johnstone said. ''I didn't think I had it long enough. If I
had held it a second more he would have been out.''
</P>
<P>
   Gabe White (2-0) retired all four batters he faced in relief and
Jose Jimenez got the final out for his fourth save.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants erased a five-run deficit behind seventh-inning home
runs by Bonds and Rich Aurilia, but it wasn't enough as San
Francisco lost for the fifth time in 19 games.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Helton, the National League RBIs leader, went 2-for-3 with
a solo homer for Colorado and raised his major league-leading
average to .414 (53-for-128). He is hitting .536 (30-for-53) at
Coors Field.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockies improved to 11-4 at home and scored in double
figures for the sixth straight game at Coors Field.
</P>
<P>
   Helton's solo homer, his 13th, gave the Rockies a 9-4 lead in
the sixth, but Rockies starter Pedro Astacio could not hold on as
he missed a chance to set Colorado's career victory record.
</P>
<P>
   Astacio, whose 39 wins with Colorado are tied with Kevin Ritz,
gave up seven runs and left the game after Bonds hit his solo homer
to cut the lead to 9-7. Stan Belinda issued a walk and gave up
Aurilia's fourth homer of the year one out later.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco starter Shawn Estes, who threw a complete-game
shutout against the Rockies seven days ago, gave up seven runs,
eight hits and five walks in four innings. He had allowed four
earned runs in his previous three starts.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Giants placed OF Ellis Burks (strained left quadriceps)
on the 15-day disabled list. The move is retroactive to May 9. To
replace Burks, San Francisco purchased the contract of Terrell
Lowery from Triple-A Fresno. ... Giants 3B Bill Mueller extended
his hitting streak to 10 games. ... The Rockies placed OF Larry
Walker on the 15-day disabled list. He is expected to miss at least
a month with a stress fracture in his right elbow. Colorado
purchased Carpenter's contract from Triple-A Colorado Springs and
moved RHP Jerry Dipoto to the 60-day disabled list. Carpenter, a
career minor leaguer, made his major league debut. ... Helton
fouled off nine pitches with two strikes before hitting his 13th
homer of the season. ... Bonds became the sixth player to reach the
third deck at Coors Field with his 457-foot homer in the seventh.

<HEADLINE> Party Calls for Pols Resignation  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- A small Mexican opposition party said
Saturday it would ask its presidential candidate to resign, after
he called for a ''united front'' against the ruling PRI, the
government news agency Notimex reported.
</P>
<P>
   In an extraordinary session of its national assembly, the
Authentic Party of the Mexican Revolution, or PARM, voted to ask
Porfirio Munoz Ledo to step down, Notimex reported.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement came shortly after the release of the first
major poll to place Fox ahead of the ruling Institutional
Revolutionary Party, or PRI, which has governed Mexico for 71
years.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at a news conference, Vicente Diaz Lopez, a
representative of the center-right party, said Munoz Ledo
''intended to sell the party to the extreme political right of this
country,'' by considering backing the leading opposition candidate,
Vicente Fox, of the conservative National Action Party.
</P>
<P>
   PARM plans to replace Munoz Ledo with its party's president,
Carlos Guzman Perez, Notimex reported.
</P>
<P>
   Munoz Ledo could not be reached for comment Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the candidate called on all five opposition groups
to form a united front against the governing party, but he stopped
short of endorsing Fox. It is too late by law for the parties to
join a true coalition, but they can informally endorse one of the
front-runners.
</P>
<P>
   That same day, the Interior Ministry publicly accused Munoz Ledo
of trying to take over the leadership of the party he represents.
Munoz Ledo said that charge was meant to destabilize his candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   With the July 2 election less than two months away, Fox was
favored by 46.3 percent, according to a poll conducted by Zogby
International. Francisco Labastida of the PRI was favored by 41.6
percent. The margin of error was plus or minus 3.2 percentage
points.

Main No Gun Ri Allegations Backed
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The New York Times reported today that Army investigators
had confirmed the central finding of an Associated Press report into the killing
of civilians by U.S. forces during the Korean War, even as U.S. News &AMP; World
Report questioned three U.S. veterans who said they witnessed the episode. AP
said it stood behind its 1999 story, and two historians told The Washington Post
that they believed a mass killing had occurred. The Times cited senior Defense
officials saying that an Army investigation ''has confirmed the central element
of the (AP) report'' that American troops fired on refugees near the hamlet of
No Gun Ri during a chaotic period early in the war.

   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- Wails of sorrow mixed with calls for revenge Saturday
hours after rockets shook Baghdad in the third bombardment in less than two
months on the heart of the tightly policed Iraqi capital. A 3-year-old girl,
Zahra Mohammed Hammeed, was killed and four of her relatives were wounded in the
attack, which Iran-based Iraqi dissidents said targeted the presidential palace.
Two rockets struck homes in the Karadat Mariam district west of Baghdad at just

Calif. Gov: Eliminate Teachers' Tax

   SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Gov. Gray Davis proposed eliminating the state
income tax for public-school teachers today, a dramatic move he said would
reward teachers for ''investing their lives in our children's future.'' The
plan, which requires approval of the Legislature, was accompanied by a separate,
$500 million teacher-incentive program that offers cash bonuses of up to $5,000
to teachers whose students perform well in the schools' new statewide testing
program. Together, the proposals would cost about $3 billion over the first
three years, although the administration said that figure could change with the

that as of today Giuliani had not made a decision about whether to proceed with
the campaign and wouldn't do so until he had more time to consider his medical

the final seconds, including a 3-pointer as time expired that could have ended
the series. The Pacers rallied from an 18-point deficit to lead by five after
Miller and Philadelphia's Matt Geiger were ejected with 1:19 left in the third
quarter. Both are subject to suspensions for the next game Monday.

<HEADLINE> Clarification Sought in Tripp Case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ELLICOTT CITY, Md. (AP) -- State prosecutors are asking a judge
to clarify her ruling limiting evidence that can be used in
Maryland's wiretapping case against Linda Tripp, hoping to salvage
some of Monica Lewinsky's testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Diane Leasure ruled May 5 that Lewinsky's testimony to a
Maryland grand jury was tainted by Tripp's immunized testimony to
federal authorities. She also questioned Lewinsky's credibility,
saying the former White House intern had lied under oath and might
have ''shaped'' her testimony in a December hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Tripp was indicted by a Howard County grand jury in July for
violating the state's wiretapping laws when she secretly recorded a
Dec. 22, 1997 phone conversation with Lewinsky, then had her
attorney play it for Newsweek magazine. Prosecutors believe Tripp's
secret taping of her conversations with Lewinsky constitute
wiretapping.
</P>
<P>
   State Prosecutor Stephen Montanarelli said that while Leasure's
ruling means Lewinsky cannot identify her voice on the tape, his
motion Friday says the order ''implicitly allows testimony
identifying and authenticating the conversation.''
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors hope that if the motion is approved, they can use
Lewinsky's identification of her voice to build a circumstantial
case against Tripp.
</P>
<P>
   Tripp's trial is scheduled to begin July 10. If convicted, she
could face 10 years in prison and a $20,000 fine.

<HEADLINE> Nelson Leads Nationwide Seniors  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALPHARETTA, Ga. (AP) -- Larry Nelson shot a 5-under-par 67 to
take a one-shot lead Saturday over Walter Hall and Mark Hayes after
the second round of the Nationwide Championship.
</P>
<P>
   Battling blustery winds and 90-degree heat, Nelson missed only
two greens to move to 8 under for the tournament. The Marietta,
Ga., resident is seeking his second victory this year and sixth of
his career on the Senior PGA Tour.
</P>
<P>
   Hall used a 7-iron for a hole-in-one at the Golf Club of
Georgia's 13th hole en route to carding a 64, the day's low round.
</P>
<P>
   Hall's bogey-free round included six birdies. The former
appliance salesman, who lost a four-way playoff to Lanny Wadkins at
the ACE Group Classic in February, is aiming for his first victory.
</P>
<P>
   Hayes entered the second round with a one-shot lead and shot an
even-par 72 by closing with two straight birdies.
</P>
<P>
   A bad drive at the par-4 16th hole landed in the left rough and
led to a bogey, but Hayes recovered by rolling in a 20-foot putt at
the par-3 17th hole and making a five-foot birdie putt at the 18th.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson, the tour's No. 2 money winner with earnings of $729,100,
had birdies on 16 and 17. He hit a 9-iron within 6 feet on the 16th
hole and a 4-iron within 8 feet on the 17th.
</P>
<P>
   Hubert Green and defending champion Hale Irwin are both two
strokes back. A double bogey at No. 12 kept Green, who began the
day at 4 under, from gaining more ground. Irwin's round was
highlighted by a 30-foot putt for birdie at No. 15 and a 25-foot
par saver at No. 17.
</P>
<P>
   Irwin won the Nationwide last year with an eagle from 74 feet
out on the final hole. It marked the first of five straight
victories for Irwin, who won 25 senior events in his first five
years but has yet to win this year.
</P>
<P>
   Gil Morgan, Bruce Summerhays, Tom Jenkins and Vicente Fernandez
are all five strokes back.
</P>
<P>
Divots: The threesome of Nelson, Hall and Hayes will tee off at
2:25 p.m. EDT Sunday. ... Nelson's 80-year-old mother, Ruddell
Nelson, walked all 18 holes. ... Tom Watson, seeking his first
senior victory, is four strokes back after a 71. ... Tom Kite is
also four strokes back. His 66 put him in a tie with Rocky Thompson
and John Bland. ... Money leader Bruce Fleisher is playing in
Ireland this weekend.

<HEADLINE> Tour Given of Los Alamos Lab  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN MacDONALD
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ALAMOS, N.M. (AP) -- In a move officials called
unprecedented, Los Alamos National Laboratory gave an extensive
tour of its facilities to reporters Saturday, trying to allay fears
that a wildfire damaged key research and nuclear waste areas at the
high-security facility.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is an attempt to show you we are not hiding anything,''
said Gene Habiger, director of security and emergency response for
the Department of Energy. ''If anyone thinks the government, the
Department of Energy, can suppress the truth, they're wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   The agency and the laboratory have come under criticism in
recent days, accused by anti-nuclear activists of not being
forthcoming about the extent of damage and possible health concerns
caused by the fire that scorched northern New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The blaze began as a government-prescribed burn to clear brush
in the Bandelier National Monument, adjacent to the lab. But the
fire quickly got out of hand, fueled by dry conditions, hot
temperatures and winds of 50 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Lab officials said that while the flames started grass fires on
lab property, burned brush and destroyed several trailers, they did
not get into critical areas where nuclear materials or hazardous
waste are stored.
</P>
<P>
   Long cloaked in secrecy, the lab is one of the nation's most
important nuclear weapons research facilities and was responsible
for the growth of the town around it.
</P>
<P>
   Pressured to provide more details, the DOE and lab officials
agreed to take reporters on a 2{ hour tour of the 43-square-mile
lab. The tour included stops at key installations, including the
nation's only active plutonium facility, which is normally off
limits to the public and under 24-hour armed guard.
</P>
<P>
   At each stop, officials pointed out that despite the danger of
the fire, the lab's emergency procedures worked and prevented the
damage or loss of any significant structures.
</P>
<P>
   ''Was there ever the risk of total disaster? If you mean
disaster in the sense of losing one of these facilities, I would
say we were a long way from that,'' said Stan Busboom, the lab's
security director.
</P>
<P>
   The plutonium facility, known as Technical Area 55, sits on a
high mesa surrounded by deep ravines filled with juniper and heavy
brush. While much of the ground surrounding the facility was
charred, officials pointed to where firefighters were able to stop
the flames about 50 feet short of the high-security fence
surrounding the site.
</P>
<P>
   All through the lab grounds, fallen ponderosas and the
cobweb-like juniper bushes continued to smolder Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Burick, deputy director of operations at the lab, credited
''hero firefighters'' for preventing damage at another research
facility known as TA18. The site, where nuclear experiments are
conducted, sits in a deep gulch and was at one time nearly circled
by fire.
</P>
<P>
   One of the areas of greatest concern, a waste storage site known
as TA55, also was untouched by flames. The site is used to store
certain types of nuclear waste temporarily until it can be shipped
elsewhere for permanent disposal.
</P>
<P>
   A 1998 Energy Department study explored the possible effect of a
devastating wildfire at the laboratory. It said that in a
worst-case scenario higher levels of radiation would be released in
the plumes of smoke, but the effect would likely be negligible.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the tour, some still criticized what they saw as a lack
of information.
</P>
<P>
   ''The trouble is we really don't know what burned when and we
basically had no information from the laboratory of any sort of
detailed, technical kind that any outside person could interpret to
provide credibility,'' said Greg Mello, director of the
anti-nuclear Los Alamos Study Group. ''There definitely was
danger.''

<HEADLINE> Authorities find potassium cyanide  </HEADLINE>
By MELANIE CARROLL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Twenty barrels of stolen potassium cyanide
turned up Saturday afternoon in the Bronx after a tipster reported
they were in plain view next to a baseball park.
</P>
<P>
   Police immediately evacuated about 75 families from the Castle
Hill neighborhood after they received the anonymous 911 call around
12:15 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The barrels were located 10 days after a trailer went missing
from a Union County warehouse in Linden, N.J. It contained a
shipping container with the drums of potassium cyanide, destined
for Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   The trailer that had been loaded with the cyanide was found
empty late Friday, without a cab or license plates, in an
industrial park in Queens in the Long Island City section.
</P>
<P>
   The orange drums were each marked with the number ''1680,'' an
industrywide number used to identify the chemical, said Officer
Joseph Pentangelo, a police spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators wearing protective suits inspected the orange
barrels -- which were laying in short grass upon their sides -- to
ensure they remained sealed, and then covered the containers until
they were removed, said Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a real credit to the emergency response of the city of
New York,'' Giuliani said at a press conference near the scene.
''It could have been very dangerous. It turned out that it
wasn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Police said it was unclear how the barrels holding the deadly
chemicals arrived on Pugsley Avenue, in between Cicero and Lacombe
Avenues.
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously the person who stole it, since they were dumped this
way, had no idea what they were taking,'' said Richard J. Sheirer,
the director of the city's Office of Emergency Management.
</P>
<P>
   Police also were unsure how long the barrels had been there
since being stolen. But neighbors weren't surprised to find
something left there.
</P>
<P>
   ''They dump stuff around here all the time,'' said Jesus
Raimundi, who lives in Pugsley Avenue. ''I've been fighting if for
13 years.''
</P>
<P>
   The barrels were removed around 4:15 p.m., and residents were
allowed to return to their homes. By that time, a group of young
men were already playing baseball on the field.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI confiscated the barrels. Federal agents and the NYPD
will continue investigating.
</P>
<P>
   ''The No. 1 focus has been the public safety,'' said FBI
spokesman Joe Valiquette. ''The focus now is to find out who is
responsible for the theft.''
</P>
<P>
   The World Health Organization says potassium cyanide could be
used by terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't believe it's terrorists,'' Sheirer had said early
Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Robert J. Cordier, of the FBI's New York office, said the
federal agency was involved in the investigation only because it
involved an interstate theft.
</P>
<P>
   ''Right now, we don't have anything to indicate to us that it is
something like that,'' Cordier said when asked whether he thought
terrorists might be involved in the theft.
</P>
<P>
   Potassium cyanide is used in electroplating, a process employed
to make silverware and jewelry, and can be fatal to anyone who
drinks or inhales it. The manmade chemical kills by preventing
oxygen from reaching vital organs.

<HEADLINE> Willey on Verge of Bankruptcy  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- Kathleen Willey, who accused President
Clinton of an unwanted sexual advance at the White House in 1993,
is hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt and likely will be
declared insolvent, a federal bankruptcy court official says.
</P>
<P>
   Willey voluntarily filed for protection under federal bankruptcy
laws last month, listing debts of more than $700,000 and assets of
$19,011, primarily household furnishings, a car and a wedding ring.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's my impression at this time that we'll be in a no-asset
bankruptcy case,'' U.S. Bankruptcy Trustee J. Stephen Bus said
Friday at a meeting of creditors.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton denied Willey's allegation. A federal judge ruled in
March that the president had violated privacy laws by releasing
Willey's letters to him to undermine her credibility.
</P>
<P>
   Her money trouble stemmed from nearly $275,000 her late husband,
Ed Willey, embezzled from a client, according to court papers. Ed
Willey killed himself in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Willey, a real estate lawyer who made some bad investments in
the late 1980s, was hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt to the
Internal Revenue Service.

<HEADLINE> Performing Magic Win Illinois Derby  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CICERO, Ill. (AP) -- Performing Magic overtook favored Country
Only in the final strides and won the $500,000 Illinois Derby by a
head at Sportsman's Park on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Performing Magic, ridden by Shane Sellers for the first time ,
won the Derby Trial in his last start but went off as the second
choice in the nine-horse field.
</P>
<P>
   Trainer by Alex Hassinger Jr., Performing Magic won $300,000 for
owner Prince Ahmed Salman of Riyadh in Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   Sellers, winning his first Illinois Derby, said the colt is a
stalker. ''I knew he could be close to the pace.''
</P>
<P>
   And when Country Only, who led from the start, began tiring in
the stretch, Performing Magic had enough finishing kick to get the
win.
</P>
<P>
   Performing Magic covered the 1 1-8 miles in 1:50.86.
</P>
<P>
   Country Coast, who went off at odds of 36-1, was third, ahead of
Kombat Kat.
</P>
<P>
   Performing Magic paid $6.20, $3.20 and $2.80 in winning for the
fourth time in 12 career starts. The 3-year-old colt, who began
racing in England, now has two wins, a second and a third in four
starts in the United States.

<HEADLINE> Americans Sweep Synchronized Titles  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- David Pichler and Mark Ruiz won the
synchronized platform final and P.J. Bogart and Chris Devine
captured the synchronized 3-meter event Saturday at the FINA-USA
Diving Grand Prix.
</P>
<P>
   Pichler and Ruiz scored 301.26 points to 298.50 for Mathew Helm
and Robert Newbery of Australia. Ivan Bondarenko and Alisher Seitov
of Kazakhstan were third with 234.78.
</P>
<P>
   Pichler, of Fort Lauderdale, and Ruiz, of Orlando, just began
working together at last month's indoor nationals.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're still ironing out some wrinkles,'' Pichler said. ''It
would be nice if we both end up making the (Olympic) team and doing
it together, if we get a little more chance to work on it we should
end up doing real well.
</P>
<P>
   ''We seem to be making some little stupid mistakes, I know I am,
anyway. We didn't do near as well as we could have.''
</P>
<P>
   Bogart and Devine have worked together for three years, but
don't get in a lot of practice time because Bogart lives in Eden
Prairie, Minn., while Devine resides in Lighthouse Point, Fla. They
have twice combined for titles, but not at international events.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've never won anything at the international level, so this
is kind of a nice thing to do,'' said Devine, the 1994 Big 10
Conference champion in 3-meter diving at Penn State. ''When we got
up there on the board, he looked at me and said, 'It's a contest.'
In other words, we've got a chance at this.''
</P>
<P>
   They won a very close event, scoring 288.90 points to 288.78 for
Germany's Stefan Ahrens and Alexander Mesch and 288.60 for China's
Wang Tianling and Yu Zhuocheng.
</P>
<P>
   In the only women's final Saturday, Russians Vera Ilyina and
Yulia Pakhalina won the synchronized 3-meter final with 297.75
points.

<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT DETRICK, Md. (AP) -- A civilian researcher working for the
Army on a vaccine against a rare bacterial disease contracted the
illness after accidentally being exposed to bacteria.
</P>
<P>
   The civilian microbiologist, identified only as a man in his
mid-30s, was recently diagnosed with glanders, a bacterial
infection typically found in horses and donkeys, said Col. Gerald
W. Parker, commander of the Army Medical Research Institute of
Infectious diseases, where the exposure occurred.
</P>
<P>
   While the disease is almost always fatal if left untreated, the
microbiologist was taken to Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore and
was expected to make a full recovery.
</P>
<P>
   The researcher was working on a vaccine for glanders. He first
became ill in March, complaining of fever, malaise and weight loss.
He was admitted to nearby Frederick Memorial Hospital May 2 and
transferred to Johns Hopkins May 4.
</P>
<P>
   The disease in humans is virtually unknown in the U.S., but
appears periodically in South America, Africa and Asia. It was
allegedly used by the Japanese during World War II to infect
horses, civilians and prisoners of war.

<HEADLINE> Giuliani Mulling Political Future  </HEADLINE>
By BETH GARDINER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- At the end of a topsy-turvy week, Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani stepped out of the spotlight Saturday, canceling a
campaign appearance and spending much of the day mulling his
medical options as uncertainty hung over his Senate campaign.
</P>
<P>
   His campaign manager, Bruce Teitelbaum, said that as of Saturday
Giuliani had not made a decision about whether to proceed with the
campaign and wouldn't do so until he had more time to consider his
medical treatment. Giuliani was recently diagnosed with prostate
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know what he's going to do,'' Teitelbaum said.
</P>
<P>
   An announcement about whether the mayor plans to stay in the
U.S. Senate race against first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton could
come as soon as Sunday or Monday, according to a person
knowledgeable about Giuliani's discussions with political advisers
who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor backed out of a GOP dinner in Oneonta where he was to
have been the keynote speaker. He spent the day in New York City,
where a campaign adviser said he was thinking about how to proceed
with his treatment options.
</P>
<P>
   But he also held a surprise news conference in the Bronx,
playing his favorite public role -- mayor in charge of a city
emergency -- after police discovered several barrels of stolen
cyanide.
</P>
<P>
   After briefing reporters on emergency workers' efforts, Giuliani
cautioned the press not to read too much into his decision to
cancel the Oneonta event.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've decided that I needed the time to do some consultation,''
he said. ''At this point I don't think I was up to taking the trip,
actually just taking the trip in the car for three hours. ... It
wasn't a good idea to do it healthwise.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's personal life remained a subject of intense
speculation. Just days after announcing plans to separate from wife
Donna Hanover -- she responded with a public accusation that he had
had a relationship with an aide -- Giuliani dined out Friday with
Judith Nathan, the woman he has called his ''very good friend.''
</P>
<P>
   He and Nathan ate with several aides at an Italian restaurant on
the Upper East Side of Manhattan and then smiled for photographers.
</P>
<P>
   The city's tabloids gobbled up the story, contrasting Giuliani's
night out with Hanover's flight to her parents' California home.

Los Alamos Lab Toured To Allay Fears
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   LOS ALAMOS, N.M. (AP) -- In a move officials called unprecedented, Los Alamos
National Laboratory gave an extensive tour of its facilities to reporters today,
trying to allay fears that a wildfire damaged key research and nuclear waste
areas at the high-security facility. ''This is an attempt to show you we are not
hiding anything,'' said Gene Habiger, director of security and emergency
response for the Department of Energy. The agency and the laboratory have come
under criticism in recent days, accused by anti-nuclear activists of not being
forthcoming about the extent of damage and possible health concerns caused by
the fire that scorched northern New Mexico.

Government negotiators had announced earlier Saturday that they had reached an

said it stood behind its 1999 story, and two historians told The Washington Post
that they believed a mass killing had occurred. The Times cited senior Defense
officials saying that an Army investigation ''has confirmed the central element
of the (AP) report'' that American troops fired on refugees near the hamlet of

<HEADLINE> Danish Brothers Win Song Contest  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) -- Two middle-aged brothers playing
guitars gave Denmark a surprising victory in Europe's biggest song
contest Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Performing before a sellout crowd of some 13,000 at the Globe
arena and an estimated 100 million viewers in nearly three dozen
European countries as well as Australia and Japan, Joergen and
Niels Olsen won with a song called ''Fly on the Wings of Love.''
</P>
<P>
   Their song has captivated Denmark, thanks not only to its
infectious, happy rhythm, but also due to the lyrics, which are
Joergen Olsen's tribute to the mature woman.
</P>
<P>
   It was Denmark's second victory in the Eurovision Song Contest
since its inception in 1956. The first came in 1963.
</P>
<P>
   Denmark took the early lead in the vote count and never looked
back. Russia's entry, 16-year-old Alsou, finished second for the
song ''Solo,'' written by Americans Andrew Lane and Brandon Barnes.
Artists from Latvia, Estonia and Germany rounded out the top five.
</P>
<P>
   The Olsens have been composing, singing and performing together
since they started their careers by forming a pop group named The
Kids at age 11 and 15, respectively. They have appeared in six
Danish Song Contests, but never won until this year.
</P>
<P>
   The audience in the modern, high-tech contest made up the jury.
Except for Russia, Romania and the Netherlands, viewers
participated in selecting the winner by telephonic voting. To even
out the odds for participants from small nations, it was impossible
to vote for the country where the phone call was registered. In
host country Sweden, 132,000 people voted.
</P>
<P>
   Sweden won the right to host for the fourth time after Swede
Charlotte Nilsson won last year in Israel by singing ''Take Me To
Your Heaven'' while dressed in a 1970s-style pink-and-beige
pantsuit. Sweden's first win came in 1974, when ''Waterloo''
brought ABBA international fame.
</P>
<P>
   Denmark will host next year's show.

<TEXT>
<P>
   RACELAND, La. (AP) -- Donald George Bollinger, the founder of
Bollinger Shipyards Inc. and an influential Republican in Louisiana
politics, died Saturday of heart failure. He was 85.
</P>
<P>
   Bollinger played a key role in the Louisiana Republican Party's
resurgence in the 1970s, served as chairman of the party, and was
secretary of public safety and corrections under Gov. Dave Treen in
the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Bollinger, a machinist, started the family company in 1946 in a
backyard shop. Today, the company has eight shipyards throughout
south Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   As a political activist, Bollinger helped to build the state GOP
from a virtual nonentity into a powerful force.
</P>
<P>
   The work culminated in 1979, when Treen was elected Louisiana's
first Republican governor since Reconstruction. Treen said Saturday
that he would miss Bollinger.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm deeply saddened by his passing,'' Treen said. ''He was a
man of integrity and honesty.''
</P>
<P>
   Bollinger served as chairman of the Louisiana Republican Party
between 1984 and 1986. He retired from overseeing the shipyards in
1989.
Harry Volk
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Harry J. Volk, an innovative leader who
successfully led Union Bank through recession, died Friday. He was
94.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Trenton, N.J., Volk earned business and law degrees at
Rutgers University.
</P>
<P>
   He divided his long career between Prudential Insurance Co. and
Union Bank and left a lasting imprint on the insurance and banking
industries.
</P>
<P>
   When he arrived in Los Angeles in 1947, he was the youngest vice
president in Prudential history at 41. He helpd create the
company's first regional home office as part of the
decentralization of the mammoth company he helped engineer.
</P>
<P>
   Volk's work at Prudential led to his 1957 recruitment as
chairman and chief executive officer of Union Bank, where for 23
years he led the bank through a period in which banks across the
country were surrounded by loan defaults. He retired from the bank
in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Volk also was a founder of the Los Angeles Music Center and Los
Angeles County Museum of the Art.

<HEADLINE> Kabila's Envoy Meets Rwandan Leader  </HEADLINE>
By HRVOJE HRANJSKI
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) -- A Congolese envoy on Saturday carried a
rare message of peace to Rwanda, Congo's principal enemy in 1{-year
civil war, Rwandan officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Carrying a message from Congolese President Laurent Kabila,
Congo's justice minister, Mwenze Kongolo, met with Rwandan
President Paul Kagame, officials said. It was the first high-level
meeting since Rwandan troops and weapons poured across the border
in support of Congolese rebels in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Kabila reportedly expressed his interest for a quick end to the
war and hoped to initiate direct contact with Rwanda, officials
familiar with the meeting said.
</P>
<P>
   Neither government officially commented on the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The peace process in Congo has reached a crucial stage, with
plans by the United Nations to deploy 5,537 U.N. monitors to
oversee a fragile cease-fire, separation of combatants and a
withdrawal of foreign troops.
</P>
<P>
   Kabila and the rebels signed a peace agreement last August and
reaffirmed their commitment to a cease-fire last month. Zimbabwe,
Angola and Namibia, which back Kabila, have also signed, as did
Rwanda and Uganda, which back the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   But since last week, Rwandan and Ugandan armies who back rival
rebel factions have clashed in the northern Congolese city of
Kisangani, leaving at least 28 civilians and 15 soldiers dead.
</P>
<P>
   The unexpected fighting on the sidelines of the Congolese war
has complicated plans to deploy U.N. observers and troops, as U.N.
officials in Congo focused their attention on preventing the wider
conflict between the two allies.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, former Botswana President Ketumile Masire returned to
the Congolese capital, Kinshasa, in his role as a mediator among
the government, rebels and Congolese political parties who are
supposed to agree on the shape of Congo's future democratic
government.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Bill would ask those registering vehicles for eye money  </HEADLINE>
By JENNIFER JORDAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- State Sen. Kemp Hannon knows firsthand how
troublesome correcting children's vision problems can be.
</P>
<P>
   When his twin daughters were faring poorly in school, it took
weeks of conversation with teachers and the 9-year-old girls before
the adults realized faulty eyesight may be to blame.
</P>
<P>
   Waiting to see an ophthalmologist required another six weeks. If
the children were even younger with less-developed communication
skills, a resolution may have taken longer.
</P>
<P>
   ''The school didn't figure it out,'' said Hannon, chairman of
the Senate's health committee. ''The statistic is 80 percent of
kids under 6 are not being screened for visual difficulties.''
</P>
<P>
   Hannon has proposed a bill to raise money specially for
youngsters with eye problems through donations by people who are
registering vehicles in New York state. By checking a box on
registration applications, drivers would be able to donate $1, the
measure said.
</P>
<P>
   Money from the fund would be used for vision tests, protective
eyeware and eyesight education for people who care for young
children.
</P>
<P>
   The bill is sponsored in the state Assembly by health committee
Chairman Richard Gottfried, a Manhattan Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   ''The thought was that now that we're doing earlier screening
for hearing problems, we should do the same for vision,'' Hannon
said.
</P>
<P>
   Curtailing amblyopia, or ''lazy eye,'' is the program's main
goal. The condition, which is diagnosed in 2 percent to 3 percent
of children who are screened, is from misalignment or crossed eyes
or one eye that focuses better than the other, according to Prevent
Blindness America. If untreated, the weaker eye may become
functionally blind.
</P>
<P>
   The fund would also provide protective eyewear for children.
Damage to the ''strong eye'' of a child who has amblyopia could
cause blindness, said Rosemary Clemens, CEO of Prevent Blindness
New York.
</P>
<P>
   Florida, Texas, Ohio and Utah are among the states with programs
similar to the Hannon-Gottfried bill.
</P>
<P>
   A similar donation checkoff box is offered on state income tax
forms, but this would be the first time driver registration forms
would be used.
</P>
<P>
   The popularity of donations in tax forms varies. So far this
year, $43,563 had been donated to the Gift to Lake Placid from tax
refunds. The Gift to Breast Cancer has fared much better -- bringing
in $433,737.
</P>
<P>
   New Yorkers can also donate to the Return a Gift to Wildlife
Fund and the Missing and Exploited Children Fund on their tax
returns.
</P>
<P>
   While praising the bill's intent, Clemens said the bill should
also include donation checkoffs on drivers' license renewals,
instead of just vehicle registration.
</P>
<P>
   She also objected to a provision in the bill, drafted in part
and lobbied for by the New York State Ophthalmological Society,
that would allow only licensed professionals to join an advisory
council to help manage the ''save our sight'' fund. Prevent
Blindness, a nonprofit that screens children at day-care programs
and Head Start programs and has support groups for people with eye
problems, would not be included in that definition.
</P>
<P>
   ''By leaving out other groups, that to me is unacceptable and
doesn't cover the spectrum of people who supply these services,''
she said.

<HEADLINE> Long Shot Out Of Mind Wins Race  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- Long shot Out Of Mind and Eddie
Delahoussaye broke slowly but worked quickly in deep stretch to win
the $150,000 Mervyn LeRoy Handicap by a half length Saturday at
Hollywood Park.
</P>
<P>
   Early Pioneer, with Matt Garcia, finished second, 4{ lengths in
front of Skimming and Victor Espinoza in a field of seven in the
Grade II handicap for 3-year-olds and up. Laffit Pincay Jr. rode
favorite Puerto Madero, a 6-year-old bay carrying high weight 120
pounds, for seventh place. Puerto Madero had 11 wins in 23 starts
with earnings of $1.3 million but hasn't won in 16 months.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know what's wrong with him,'' Pincay said. ''He broke
good and I figured I'd be laying close. We went into the first turn
and he wanted to back off.''
</P>
<P>
   Out Of Mind, a 5-year-old bay and stablemate of Chilean-bred
Puerto Madero, covered 1 1/16 miles on a track rated fast in 1:41
4-5, winning $90,000 for career earnings of $180,313 in 12 starts.
The 13-1 shot paid $28.40, $10.20 and $7.20.
</P>
<P>
   Out of the gate in last place, Brazilian-bred Out Of Mind
settled off the rail and made a sharp move forward on the second
turn.
</P>
<P>
   Delahoussaye also won at Santa Anita aboard Out Of Mind.
</P>
<P>
   ''The day I won on him, I let him settle and just made one
run,'' Delahoussaye said. ''He proved he liked it that way better
than running early. I thought I moved too soon today. I moved at
the three-eighths pole. I should have waited for the quarter pole
and I'd have won easily.''

<HEADLINE> Text of Bob Knight Statement  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   Text of statement issued Saturday by Indiana
University
basketball coach Bob Knight:
<TEXT>
<P>
   I was asked not to comment on the pending matter involving me,
and I intend to continue to be one person honoring the request.
However, I do feel I should address something that was not a factor
in the investigated incident: my temper.
</P>
<P>
   Practically all of us have some problem to deal with in life.
For some, it's something as simple as meeting people or talking in
front of people. My temper problem is a lot more troublesome than
those, and it's something I've had to deal with for as long as I
can remember.
</P>
<P>
   There are times when my passion for basketball led me into
confrontations that I could have handled a lot better. I've always
been too confrontational, especially when I know I'm right. I know
as well as anybody does: I have to develop a more diplomatic
approach. I'm not very good at just forgetting something and going
on, and I'm truly sorry about that.
</P>
<P>
   I am working on it, and I have a helper. I've mentioned before
that my wife has posted signs around our house: ''The horse is
dead. Get off it.'' As hard as that is for me to do, I think I'm
getting better at it because of her and those signs.
</P>
<P>
   When I get on a kid or a team in practice, I always wind up more
upset with myself than with anyone else. I can, and invariably do,
make it up to kids, but I can't do that with myself. I can, and I
will, try a little harder.
</P>
<P>
   I'm as proud as a man could be of the basketball program we have
been able to build over these last 29 years, prouder of the great
kids who have made up that program and what they have gone on to do
and be than I am of the games and the championships they have won.
Intense, demand and temper have been a three-braided rope for me,
and I really believe the first two have been a major reason for the
success of our kids and teams. It's my job and my determination to
temper that third braid. I'll leave it up to our kids to judge if
I'm improving, just as it is my job to keep improving them.

<HEADLINE> FBI Computer Flaw Halts Gun Sales  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The FBI hoped to have an internal software
problem fixed by daybreak Sunday that would allow a resumption of
firearms sales that are dependent on background checks with the
bureau's criminal history database, an official said late Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI's Interstate Identification Index, a database containing
criminal histories of 36 million people, stopped working late
Thursday afternoon, the bureau said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   This computer failure at the FBI Criminal Information Center in
Morgantown, W.Va., halted gun sales because it prevented completion
of background checks that the Brady law requires for buyers.
</P>
<P>
   Gun dealers had hoped for a quick fix because Saturday is their
busiest day. However, the system remain down throughout the day.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesman Steve Fisher said Saturday night the best estimate was
that it would be up and running again between midnight and 6 a.m.
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher said the plan was to message users -- gunshop users and
state and local law enforcement agencies -- as soon as the system
was restored.
</P>
<P>
   Without background check approvals, gun dealers have been forced
to tell their customers to wait for their guns until the system
comes back up and the checks can be completed.
</P>
<P>
   The computer failure made it impossible for the National Instant
Criminal Background Check System, or NICS, to check the criminal
histories for past felony convictions that bar people from buying
guns. Also brought down was the FBI's automated fingerprint system.
</P>
<P>
   When the system is working, 72 percent of gun purchases are
approved within 30 seconds, the Justice Department says. And 95
percent of buyers get an approval or a disapproval within two hours
of their purchase application.

<HEADLINE> Journalist Convicted in Romania  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) -- A journalist accused of writing
articles with an ''anti-Semitic'' character has been handed a
two-year suspended prison sentence for ''nationalist propaganda,''
the daily newspaper Ziua reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Mihai Bogdan Antonescu, 35, was convicted Thursday by a
Bucharest court, which ruled he had written anti-Semitic articles
in 1997 to 1998 in the weekly newspaper ''Attacking the Person,''
where he was formerly the deputy editor-in-chief.
</P>
<P>
   One article appearing in the paper called members of the
government ''dirty Jews'' and Gypsies. Another referred to Jews as
''virtual soap'' -- a reference to the Nazi practice of making soap
from the remains of Jews killed in World War II death camps. The
same article lamented the lack of ''barbed wire and Cyclone B'' --
the gas widely used to execute inmates at Nazi concentration camps.
</P>
<P>
   Antonescu's case gained international prominence in 1999, when
FIFA -- the world's top soccer body -- recommended that the Romanian
soccer federation examine all publications owned by Dumitru
Dragomir, who is the deputy chairman of the Romanian soccer league
and owner of ''Attacking the Person'' for anti-Semitic bias.
</P>
<P>
   FIFA had previously asked the Romanian soccer league to
investigate Dragomir following an official complaint from the New
York-based Anti-Defamation League.
</P>
<P>
   There was no comment from Antonescu after the ruling. He was the
first journalist to be sued for ''nationalist and chauvinist
propaganda,'' since communism ended in 1989.

<HEADLINE> Cubs 2, Expos 1  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL (AP) -- Jon Lieber won his third straight decision,
pitching the Chicago Cubs past the Montreal Expos 2-1 Saturday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Lieber (4-2) allowed seven hits in his second complete game of
the season. He struck out five and walked none.
</P>
<P>
   The Expos trailed by a run when Jose Vidro hit a leadoff double
in the eighth. Cubs second baseman Eric Young made a diving stop on
Lee Stevens' hard grounder to prevent Vidro from scoring with two
outs.
</P>
<P>
   Vidro also had a single in extending his hitting streak to a
career-high 11 games.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Armas Jr. (0-1) allowed two runs and three hits in five
innings in his season debut with the Expos. Making just his second
major league start, he also walked five, and two of them came in to
score.
</P>
<P>
   Armas, called up from Double-A Harrisburg last Aug. 16 to make
an emergency start for the Expos in San Francisco, retired the
first five batters he faced before walking Willie Greene with two
outs in the second.
</P>
<P>
   Shane Andrews also walked and Damon Buford followed with an RBI
single. Greene scored on a close play at the plate, sliding home
safely just ahead of right fielder Vladimir Guerrero's throw.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs made it 2-0 in the third as Sammy Sosa drew a two-out
walk and scored on Henry Rodriguez's RBI double to the wall in
right-center.
</P>
<P>
   Armas struck out two, getting Sosa both times.
</P>
<P>
   Montreal cut the lead to 2-1 on Andy Tracy's two-out RBI single
in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Notes: OF Dave Martinez is expected to join the Cubs on Sunday.
Martinez, acquired from Tampa Bay on Friday for LHP Mark Guthrie
and cash, will wear the No. 1, as he did during his first stint
with the Cubs from 1986-88. ... Expos relievers Ugueth Urbina and
Scott Strickland are both scheduled to have surgery on their ailing
right arms next Wednesday, though Strickland threw long toss
without any pain in his shoulder prior to Saturday night's game.
Strickland will throw on the side Sunday.

<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Mamadou Diallo had his second consecutive
two-goal game as the Tampa Bay Mutiny remained undefeated at home
with a 3-1 victory over the Columbus Crew on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The Mutiny's 6-0 start at Raymond James Stadium is two behind
D.C. United's MLS record of eight consecutive home victories to
start the 1998 season. Dominic Kinnear scored his first goal since
Aug. 29, 1998, in the 48th minute, and Carlos Valderrama had two
assists for the Central Division-leading Mutiny (6-4-0).
</P>
<P>
   Valderrama has 10 assists for Tampa Bay, which has outscored
opponents 20-5 at home.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Warzycha scored on a 74th-minute free kick for Columbus
(3-6-1), which lost for the second time this season at Tampa Bay.
The Crew dropped a season-opening 5-1 decision to the Mutiny on
March 18.
</P>
<P>
   The Crew are last in the Central, eight points behind Tampa Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay coach Tim Hankinson, who uses a 4-5-1 system, opted to
start Diallo over Raul Diaz Arce as the lone forward. The decision
paid off 11 minutes in when Diallo scored from 10 yards.
</P>
<P>
   A minute later, Mutiny midfielder Steve Ralston left with a
right leg injury. After being examined on the sideline, Ralston
left the field on crutches.
</P>
<P>
   Diallo beat two defenders to a pass from Valderrama in the 38th
minute to score his seventh goal of the season, giving the Mutiny a

<HEADLINE> Vatican Discloses Secret of Fatima  </HEADLINE>
By VICTOR L. SIMPSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   FATIMA, Portugal (AP) -- Ending an enduring mystery, the Vatican
disclosed the so-called third secret of Fatima on Saturday, saying
the secret the Virgin Mary is said to have told three children more
than 80 years ago was a foretelling of the shooting of Pope John
Paul II.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1917 -- when three shepherd children said the mother of
Christ appeared above an olive tree in Fatima and told them three
secrets -- many have speculated about the third.
</P>
<P>
   The first two are said to have foretold the end of World War I
and the start of World War II, and the rise and fall of Soviet
communism. Some believed the third, unrevealed secret was a
doomsday prophecy foretelling the end of the world.
</P>
<P>
   But a top Vatican cardinal said otherwise on Saturday as the
pope visited Fatima to beatify two of the three children from the
story. Cardinal Angelo Sodano said the ''interpretations'' of the
children spoke of a ''bishop clothed in white'' who, while making
his way amid the corpses of martyrs, ''falls to the ground,
apparently dead, under a burst of gunfire.''
</P>
<P>
   The description recalled the 1981 assassination attempt against
John Paul, who was wounded when a Turkish gunmen opened fire in St.
Peter's Square. The shooting came on May 13 -- the same day as the
first of the reported Fatima visions in 1917.
</P>
<P>
   Sodano recalled that John Paul has credited the Virgin of Fatima
with intervening and saving his life. He quoted the pope as saying
a ''motherly hand'' guided the bullet's path, enabling the ''dying
pope'' to halt ''at the threshold of death.''
</P>
<P>
   Many in the crowd of more than 600,000 people gathered for the
beatification burst into applause after Sodano, the Vatican's
secretary of state, spoke. Lucia Dias, a 31-year-old lawyer, called
it a ''wonderful'' moment.
</P>
<P>
   ''He knew of the prophecy and he survived it. Now he can die,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Some in the crowd, however, expressed skepticism.
</P>
<P>
   ''What they said all happened in the past,'' said Julio Estela,
33, a Portuguese car salesman. ''This isn't a prediction. It's
disappointing, I think there's more.''
</P>
<P>
   Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro-Valls told reporters later
that John Paul had read the secret within days of being elected
pontiff in 1978. Because he is personally involved in the issue, he
chose to leave the announcement to Sodano, Navarro-Valls said.
</P>
<P>
   The secret will be officially published by the Vatican within
days, Navarro-Valls said.
</P>
<P>
   The frail pope, who turns 80 Thursday, was making his third
visit to Fatima. Portugal's bishops had asked him to come for the
beatification of Jacinta Marto and her brother, Francisco, who were
7 and 8 years old at the time they reported the visions. The third
child, Sister Lucia de Jesus dos Santos, now 93, has been
cloistered in a Carmelite convent in central Portugal since 1929.
</P>
<P>
   The first two of the so-called secrets were made public by
Lucia, who met with John Paul near the tombs of her cousins. Both
died within three years of the reported visions of complications
from influenza.
</P>
<P>
   In a black nuns' habit, Lucia was assisted by two church
officials as she walked with a cane.
</P>
<P>
   Beatification is the last formal step before sainthood and can
only be performed after the person's death. The Vatican said the
two are the first children who did not die as martyrs to be so
honored.
</P>
<P>
   Many pilgrims had hoped the pope would reveal the last of three
secrets during his visit.
</P>
<P>
   The pope leaned on his staff as his hands trembled, a symptom of
Parkinson's disease, a progressive neurological disorder. But his
voice was clear and he seemed to gain strength as the ceremony went
on.
</P>
<P>
   ''I desire once again to celebrate the goodness of the Lord
toward me when, severely struck on that May 13, 1981, I was saved
from death. I also express my debt to the blessed Jacinta for the
sacrifices and prayers made for the Holy Father, whom she saw
suffer greatly,'' John Paul said in his homily.
</P>
<P>
   The pope made no direct mention of the so-called secrets, but he
spoke of the horrors of the 20th century and the two world wars.
</P>
<P>
   ''So many victims during the final century of the second
millennium!'' John Paul said.
</P>
<P>
   Upon arriving in Fatima on Friday evening, the pope placed a
gold ring that had been given to him by his mentor, the late Polish
primate Cardinal Stefan Wyszynski, at the foot of the statue of the
Virgin of Fatima. Navarro-Valls said the ring was ''one of the most
precious possessions the pope had.''
</P>
<P>
   But he denied a Portuguese newspaper report that the gesture was
a sign of the pope's imminent resignation. ''That is 150 percent
wrong,'' Navarro-Valls said.
</P>
<P>
   After his visit to the shrine of Fatima, John Paul went to
Lisbon and from there flew to Rome. The archbishop of Lisbon, Jose
Policarpo, said the pope ''told us that he was very happy and did
not feel tired.''

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Imad Baba, Mauricio Ramos and Wolde Harris
scored on free kicks as the New England Revolution beat the DC
United 3-1 on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   New England (3-2-4), despite being outshot 18-5, took a 2-1 lead
when Ramos bent a free kick around the right side of the United
wall and past a diving Tom Presthus in the 66th minute.
</P>
<P>
   DC (2-7-1), which played without its injured star Marco
Etcheverry, missed a chance to tie the game in the 79th minute when
Jaime Moreno was awarded a penalty kick, but the save was made by
Revolution goalkeeper Jeff Causey.
</P>
<P>
   Baba then finished off the United in the 82nd minute when he
sent a free kick over DC's wall that Presthus got a hand on, but
could not keep the ball out of the net.
</P>
<P>
   The United, losers of three in a row at home, opened the scoring
in the 14th minute when Moreno headed Ben Olsen's corner kick past
Causey for his eighth goal.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution tied it in the 16th minute when Harris sent a
hard skidding free kick underneath DC's leaping defensive wall and
into the United net.

<HEADLINE> Pirates 11, Brewers 8  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Bruce Aven hit his first two home runs of the
season, including a tiebreaking shot in the seventh inning Saturday
night that sent the Pittsburgh Pirates over the Milwaukee Brewers
11-8.
</P>
<P>
   The Pirates fell behind 5-0 in the first inning but came back to
end a streak of seven consecutive home losses to the Brewers.
</P>
<P>
   Wil Cordero and Brian Giles also homered for Pittsburgh. Charlie
Hayes and Henry Blanco homered for the Brewers.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Acevedo (0-1) had retired seven consecutive batters when
Aven hit his first pitch of the seventh into the seats for a 9-8
lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Pirates added a run in the seventh when Mike Benjamin hit
his second double and scored on Warren Morris' single. Kevin Young
had a sacrifice fly in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Sauerbeck (2-0) got the win with 1 2-3 innings of
scoreless relief. Mike Williams pitched the ninth for his sixth
save.
</P>
<P>
   Pirates starter Brian O'Connor came up from Double-A Altoona to
make his major league debut in place of the injured Francisco
Cordova. The Brewers had four runs before O'Connor retired a
batter.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Belliard led off with a double and scored on Mark Loretta's
single. After Jeromy Burnitz walked, Hayes hit a three-run homer.
The fifth run scored when Marquis Grissom singled and Blanco hit an
RBI double.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor retired the side in order in the second, but left after
giving up two singles and a walk to open the third. Jose Silva
pitched out that inning, the first of his four scoreless innings.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh got a run in the first off Horacio Estrada when
Benjamin doubled and scored on Giles' single. Aven hit a two-run
homer in the second.
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee took a 6-3 lead in the third on hits by Burnitz and
Grissom. Cordero homered in the bottom half.
</P>
<P>
   The Pirates went ahead 8-6 with four runs in the fourth against
reliever Jim Bruske. Giles hit a three-run homer, his 10th, and
Cordero and Luis Sojo hit doubles.
</P>
<P>
   Blanco led off the sixth with a home run off Mike Garcia and
Burnitz's sacrifice fly scored the tying run after two walks and an
groundout.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Neither starter had much control. Estrada threw 69 pitches
-- 33 strikes and 36 balls. O'Connor's 52 pitches were divided
evenly between balls and strikes. ... Aven had one other two-homer
game: June 13, 1999, while playing for Florida against the New York
Yankees. ... Cordero's home run took several minutes. His ball
struck near the top of the wall in right-center and was originally
ruled in play by second base umpire Gary Cederstrom and Cordero
stopped at second. After a lengthy conference, third base umpire
Charlie Williams overruled the call and Cordero was allowed to
finish his path around the bases. Television replays suggested the
original call was the correct one. ... The Pirates' four homers
were a season high.

<HEADLINE> Avalanche 2, Stars 0  </HEADLINE>
By JAIME ARON
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- There's nothing like a good challenge to bring out
the best in Patrick Roy.
</P>
<P>
   Fired up by claims of supremacy from Dallas goalie Ed Belfour,
Roy made 13 of his 24 saves in the third period to seal Colorado's
2-0 victory in the opener of the Western Conference finals Saturday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Milan Hejduk scored on a power play midway through the second
period and Aaron Miller added another goal later in the period as
the Avalanche ended the Stars' eight-game home winning streak in
the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Belfour, who said months ago he was as good as Roy or better,
allowed as many goals in this game as he did in the previous 10
periods at Reunion Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Bourque, a sentimental and physical leader for Colorado,
missed his third straight game with an injured left knee. He might
return for Game 2 Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Avalanche improved to 21-4-1 since his arrival. They've won
10 of their last 12 on the road and have an unusual streak of four
straight victories in series openers played on the road.
</P>
<P>
   That streak includes a Game 1 victory over the Stars in last
year's conference finals. Dallas won the series in seven games and
went on to win the Stanley Cup.
</P>
<P>
   This was the Stars' first shutout loss since Dec. 21 against
Calgary. It was their first playoff shutout defeat in 34 games,
dating to June 5, 1998, against Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Roy deserves most of the credit for the shutout, his second this
postseason and 14th of his career, tying Jacques Plante for No. 2
in NHL history. Roy extended his own record by winning his 119th
postseason game.
</P>
<P>
   After two solid periods by the Colorado defense, Roy saw more
shots in the final period than he did the first two combined. He
turned away flurry after flurry and even drew a goalie interference
penalty -- his second of the game.
</P>
<P>
   His first one resulted in Hejduk's goal with 11:09 left in the
second period.
</P>
<P>
   Adam Foote blasted a shot into Belfour's chest, and the rebound
went to Dave Andreychuk in front of the crease. He nudged the puck
to an uncovered Hejduk, who easily pushed it in for his third goal
of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado, which improved to 7-0 when scoring first in the
postseason, went up 2-0 with 2:28 left in the second period when
Miller finished a great play started by Peter Forsberg.
</P>
<P>
   Forsberg skated up the right side, then swooped across the front
of the net, pulling the defense -- and Belfour -- to his left. But
Forsberg left the puck behind to his right, and Miller hit it in
for his first goal this postseason.
</P>
<P>
   While Roy's roaming led to two manpower advantages, it almost
cost him, too.
</P>
<P>
   In the game's opening minutes, he was caught behind the net and
had the puck stolen by Aaron Gavey. Roy was spared when the pass to
Kirk Muller in front of the crease never touched Muller's stick.
</P>
<P>
   The next-closest Dallas came to scoring was a third-period slap
shot by Scott Thornton that Roy thought he'd caught, but trickled
beneath him and toward the net. He was far enough in front of the
net to quickly cover it.
</P>
<P>
   Seconds later, Roy made two good stops on a good scoring
opportunity for Stars rookie Brenden Morrow. A few minutes later,
Roy made a series of dives to turn away pucks -- and demoralize
Dallas.

Vatican Discloses Secret of Fatima
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   FATIMA, Portugal (AP) -- Ending an enduring mystery, the Vatican disclosed
the so-called third secret of Fatima on Saturday, saying the secret the Virgin
Mary is said to have told three children more than 80 years ago was a
foretelling of the shooting of Pope John Paul II. Since 1917 -- when three
shepherd children said the mother of Christ appeared above an olive tree in
Fatima and told them three secrets -- many have speculated about the third. The
first two are said to have foretold the end of World War I and the start of
World War II, and the rise and fall of Soviet communism. Some believed the
third, unrevealed secret was a doomsday prophecy foretelling the end of the
world.

FBI Flaw Still Has Gun Sales Halted
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The FBI hoped to have an internal software problem fixed
by daybreak tomorrow that would allow a resumption of firearms sales that are
dependent on background checks with the bureau's criminal history database, an
official said late today. The FBI's Interstate Identification Index, a database
containing criminal histories of 36 million people, stopped working late
Thursday afternoon, the bureau said yesterday. This computer failure at the FBI
Criminal Information Center in Morgantown, W.Va., halted gun sales because it
prevented completion of background checks that the Brady law requires for
buyers.

   ENSCHEDE, Netherlands (AP) -- A blaze inside a fireworks warehouse on
Saturday triggered multiple explosions that killed at least 20 people, wounded
230 and sent balls of fire shooting over the center of this eastern Dutch town,
media reported. A sea of black smoke plunged an entire neighborhood into
darkness as the fire raged for hours after the afternoon explosions. Helicopters
and ambulances ferried away the injured. A 625-square-yard area around the
facility was destroyed, and streets in the town of Enschede, 85 miles east of
Amsterdam, were littered with fragments of concrete and shards of window pane.

Los Alamos Lab Opened to Reporters

areas at the high-security facility. ''This is an attempt to show you we are not
hiding anything,'' said Gene Habiger, director of security and emergency

<HEADLINE> President Lauds 'Million Mom March'  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY MARGASAK
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Seven-year-old Heather McDonnell used her
show-and tell time to speak about Sunday's ''Million Mom March''
for gun control. Lorrain Franklin-Taylor, a gospel singer, wrote a
song for the Mother's Day rally. Spring Venema and her daughters
sold homemade muffins for bus fare.
</P>
<P>
   For thousands of Americans, the rallies in Washington and 70
other communities nationwide are a call to action for registration
of handguns and licensing of their owners. For others, the events
will be personal memorials to loved ones lost to bullets.
</P>
<P>
   That is the case for Heather, whose father was shot to death;
Franklin-Taylor, whose twin sons were gunned down together; and
Venema, whose father-in-law was killed with a gun.
</P>
<P>
   ''It will be the greatest Mother's Day of my life,'' said
Venema, who is from Otsego, Mich. She planned to march with her
daughters, ages 18 and 22; the three raised bus fare with their
weekly ''Million Mom Muffin'' Mondays.
</P>
<P>
   Franklin-Taylor was to participate in a rally in Oakland, where
her twin 22-year-old sons, Obadiah and Albade, were gunned down
while trying to start Obadiah's stalled car.
</P>
<P>
   The day of the killing, the gospel singer and teacher from
Hayward, Calif., was speaking at an elementary school's
African-American history event. ''I was feeling so good,'' she
said. ''The next morning my youngest son, Greg, called. He said,
'Stop what you're doing and pray for strength.'''
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to make a commitment, not just drown in our
tears,'' she said. Franklin-Taylor intended to perform the song she
wrote. The chorus goes: ''It's time to take a stand. It's time to
take a stand today.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton praised the ''Million Mom March'' in his
weekly radio address Saturday, telling Americans the pro-gun lobby
''is no match for America's moms. But our nationwide fight won't be
over tomorrow, no matter how many march.''
</P>
<P>
   While not everyone in the march will have a personal story of
grief, most have more experience as soccer moms and car pool
organizers than as demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's important enough for us to go a little bit beyond our
boundaries,'' said Joy Livingston, of Plainwell, Mich., who
responded to an ad in her church bulletin and ended up as her
state's coordinator. She has never demonstrated before.
</P>
<P>
   Joan Gold, a state coordinator from New York City, said she
''always wanted to go to demonstrations against the war in Vietnam
but I never made it. I always regretted it. This is my Vietnam.''
</P>
<P>
   Also set to demonstrate Sunday near the Washington Monument were
pro-gun supporters. The sponsor, Second Amendment Sisters, says the
''Million Mom March'' does not speak for all mothers.
</P>
<P>
   One such mother is Suzanna Gratia Hupp, a Texas state legislator
whose parents were killed when a gunman drove his pickup into a
cafeteria in Killeen, Texas, and killed 23 people, including her
parents.
</P>
<P>
   Hupp, a mother of two young sons, said she would have had a
clear shot to stop the shooter, but her handgun was 150 feet away
under the passenger seat of her car.
</P>
<P>
   The ''Million Mom March'' organizers want uniform handgun
control laws that would include licensing and registration, longer
waiting periods, a one-gun-a-month purchase limit, and child safety
standards.
</P>
<P>
   Second Amendment Sisters contends gun control increases violent
crime by shifting the balance of power to criminals and disarming
helpless victims.
</P>
<P>
   Heather McDonnell's father was shot to death in July after he
got into an argument in a bar in the New York City borough of
Queens.
</P>
<P>
   ''She gave fliers (about the march) to other kids in the
classroom'' for show-and-tell, said her mother, Martha McDonnell --
who was so depressed she would not come out of her house except to
take her daughter to and from school.
</P>
<P>
   That changed when a crossing guard gave her a flier about the
march. She got in touch with Gold, the New York coordinator, who
told her to ''go outside, do something.'' She heeded the advice and
was coming to the Washington rally with Heather and 17-year-old son
Mitchell. ''If this continues, I'm going to be there to the end,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Victoria Swain, of Charleston, W.Va., attended her last
demonstration in 1972, against the Vietnam War. She read about the
march in a magazine and became her state's coordinator. The mother
of a 3-year-old son, Swain said the Columbine shootings made her
feel ''like the world had gone crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Louria, of North Oakland, Calif., the Bay Area
coordinator, learned of the march from a parenting site on the
Internet. Mothers involved in the movement in her area ''meet one
another between 9 and midnight in cyberspace ... after the kids are
tucked into bed.''

   KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Tony Meola posted his league-leading
seventh shutout Saturday night as the Kansas City Wizards remained
unbeaten with a 2-0 victory over the New York/New Jersey
MetroStars.

</P>
<P>
   McKeon put Kansas City up 1-0 in the 49th minute with an assist
from Mo Johnston, and Chris Henderson sealed the result with a goal
in the 75th minute.
</P>
<P>
   The MetroStars (3-6) played the last 21 minutes of the game with
10 players after defender Ramiro Corrales was ejected, receiving a

<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Chan Ho Park struck out a career-high 12 and
Mark Grudzielanek hit a two-run double to snap a ninth-inning tie
as the Los Angeles Dodgers beat the St. Louis Cardinals 3-1
Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Park (4-3) followed his shortest start in almost two seasons, a
3 2-3-inning outing at Arizona in which he allowed eight runs on
nine hits, with his best of the year. He allowed three hits in
eight innings and struck out a career-best 12, including Ray
Lankford, Mike Matheny and Jim Edmonds three times.
</P>
<P>
   He walked three and also survived doing a split while striking
out Lankford in the seventh without injury.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Veres (0-1) walked Chad Kreuter to start the ninth, and
Kreuter advanced on a sacrifice and went to third on an infield hit
by pinch-hitter Dave Hansen. With two outs, Grudzielanek lined a
double into the left-field corner.
</P>
<P>
   Both runners scored as Lankford's throw hit a fan in the stands
just outside fair territory for an error.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Shaw got the last three outs for his eighth save in 12
chances. The Cardinals, who have lost five of six, have totaled
five hits the first two games of the three-game series.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers loaded the bases against reliever Mike Mohler with
nobody out in the eighth on a hit batsman, a single by Grudzielanek
and a walk to Shawn Green. Veres held them to a run on a one-out
sacrifice fly by Eric Karros that tied it at 1.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals starter Rick Ankiel had nine strikeouts and allowed
four hits in seven scoreless innings, lowering his ERA to 2.72. He
walked four, two each in the second and third, and worked out of
bases-loaded jams in both innings.

<P>
   Jose Vizcaino grounded into an inning-ending double play in the
second and Karros lined out to left to end the third against
Ankiel, 20.
</P>
<P>
   Fernando Vina's leadoff home run leading off the bottom of the
first was his first to leave the park -- and barely, at that. First
base umpire Bruce Froemming never hesitated signaling a home run on
a ball that appeared to bang off a concrete pillar just beyond the
right field fence.
</P>
<P>
   Replays shown later appeared to show the ball first made contact
at the top of the yellow line above the wall, which is in play. But
Dodgers manager Davey Johnson didn't complain.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Park had 11 strikeouts twice, the last time on July 24,
1998 against the Diamondbacks. His previous strikeout high this
season was five. ... Injured Cardinals pitchers Matt Morris and
Mark Thompson both made rehab appearances for Triple-A Memphis
Friday night. Morris (elbow) started and took the loss, allowing
five hits and three runs in four innings, and Thompson (groin)
allowed one hit in three innings with four strikeouts. ... The game
drew a sellout crowd of 48,372, the largest of the season at Busch
Stadium. ... Ankiel has 38 strikeouts and 33 walks in 43 innings.

<HEADLINE> Angels' Mercker In Stable Condition  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Anaheim pitcher Kent Mercker was under
observation in intensive care but in stable condition Saturday
night, two days after being taken to the hospital with bleeding in
his brain.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief statement, the Angels said the left-hander was
''feeling better and resting comfortably.''
</P>
<P>
   Team trainer Ned Bergert, who visited Mercker on Saturday, found
him in a much better, more alert mood than he had the day before.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was in good spirits, joking around,'' Bergert said.
</P>
<P>
   Julie Mercker arrived from the family's Ohio home to join her
husband, who is expected to continue undergoing neurological tests
in an effort to determine the cause of the bleeding.
</P>
<P>
   Mercker threw 30 pitches against Texas on Thursday night in his
second start of the season before sinking to one knee and leaving
under his own power, complaining of headaches and dizziness.
</P>
<P>
   Mercker, 32, was hospitalized that night.
</P>
<P>
   John Kusske, head of neurologic surgery at UC-Irvine Medical
Center, said test results indicated there was bleeding within the
brain. An origin was not immediately determined.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels said there was no word on when Mercker might leave
the hospital or when a decision would be made about his ability to
continue playing.
</P>
<P>
   The 12-year veteran, who pitched a no-hitter for Atlanta on
April 8, 1994, at Los Angeles, is 0-1 with a 5.16 ERA.

	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Fast-moving thunderclouds shrouded most of
the state Saturday afternoon in drenching blasts of wind and rain,
flooding already swollen central New York waterways and spinning
into tornado threats in the Mohawk Valley further east.
</P>
<P>
   ''It just got dark as night and started to rain real hard,''
said Skip Hellmig, a senior pastor at the Oneida Methodist Church.
''We had a wedding going on and I told people that if the lights go
out, just be prepared to play it by ear.''
</P>
<P>
   The storm's most concentrated punch was at Herkimer County,
where creeks spilled over their banks, sealing off roadways and
washing away a bridge. More than 300 volunteers redirected traffic,
bailed out basements and cleared debris.
</P>
<P>
   In Utica, where whole sections of the city were left under a
pool of water, Mayor Edward A. Hanna mulled declaring a state of
emergency.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's just impossible to take care of it all. We can't possibly
have enough manpower for the problems we've got,'' Hanna said.
</P>
<P>
   Manhole covers started ''blowing off'' because the city's sewers
could not accommodate so much water, Utica Police Lt. Sherman Jones
said.
</P>
<P>
   A house was damaged when a tree was blown onto its roof. A short
time later, a reinforced garage door was damaged by wind and trees
and electrical wires were blown to the ground. The National Weather
Service reported mud slides in Sauquoit and in Marathon, Cortland
County, according to age report by the Weather Service.
</P>
<P>
   Police and fire officials said the flooding took a heavy toll on
the region's transportation infrastructure, damaging bridges,
roadways and train tracks. In Utica alone, Hanna said the damage
would cost ''several hundred thousand dollars'' to repair.
</P>
<P>
   A bridge on Route 69 between Yorkville and Whitesboro was
ordered closed because the Sauquoit Creek had spilled over the top
of it, hiding it from view. Another bridge spanning the creek also
was closed.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have to wait for the water to go down and the light to come
up so we can inspect them before we can open them,'' state
Transportation Department Regional Director Frank Gerace said.
</P>
<P>
   City of Sherrill firefighters Saturday afternoon rescued a woman
from her trailer home, flooded by rainwater on its way down a hill.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Roberts' home of 21 years at 3770 Graves Road looked
like an island in the middle of a raging river of brown,
foul-smelling water.
</P>
<P>
   ''I noticed it was coming, but I didn't think it was going to be
that bad,'' Roberts told the Utica Observer-Dispatch.
</P>
<P>
   Forecasters said they received several unconfirmed reports that
tornadoes had touched down in Vernon, 16 miles west of Utica, with
others saying funnel clouds had been spotted in nearby Deerfield.
National Weather Service radar images also showed what looked to be
tornadoes, but those reports could not be verified Saturday, said
Susan Faust, a Weather Service meteorologist in Binghamton.
</P>
<P>
   Forecasters also spotted the beginnings of circular-motion
clouds in Montgomery County west of Schenectady, sending people to
basements to wait out what appeared poised to develop into a
tornado.
</P>
<P>
   In the Rensselaer County town of Hoosick, a lightning blast is
believed to have started a hoad damage in Buffalo and the along the Niagara
coast, with reports of fallen trees and wind damage and flood
warnings extending into Saturday evening.
</P>
<P>
   The round of showers and thunderstorms broke out along a cold
front stretching from the Great Lakes to the Gulf Coast, the same
cold front that produced widespread power outages across the
southern Plains, central Mississippi Valley and upper Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   One person was killed when a tornado touched down Friday evening
in Texas, about 60 miles south of Dallas. In St. Nazianz, Wis.,
straight-line wind blowing at up to 110 mph and baseball-size hail
injured several people Friday night, local officials said. At least
two tornadoes were reported during the night in southern Illinois,
and storms around Chicago caused flight delays and cancellations.
</P>
<P>
   Storms had largely cleared New York state by midnight Saturday,
with forecasters predicting a kinder, gentler Mother's Day.

By The Associated Press	   A new round of showers and thunderstorms broke out
Saturday
along a cold front stretching from the Great Lakes to the Gulf
Coast, the same front responsible for violent weather one day
earlier.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The front was pushing steadily eastward and by late afterainoon it
extended from the northerain tip of New York to southerain Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   Thunderstorms marked the front over the southerain edges of
Mississippi and Alabama, and from easterain Kentucky through West
Virginia, westerain Pennsylvania and New York.
</P>
<P>
   The blasts of wind and rain flooded already swollen waterways in
central New York.
</P>
<P>
   In Utica, N.Y., where whole sections of the city were left under
a pool of water, the mayor declared a state of emergency. Manhole
covers started ''blowing off'' because the city's sewers could not
accommodate so much water, Utica Police Lt. Sherman Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   In westerain New York, there also was widespread damage in Buffalo
and the along the Niagara coast, with reports of fallen trees and
wind damage and flood warainings.
</P>
<P>
   A few thundershowers moved ahead of the front into Maryland and
northerain Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Storms with high winds and hail larger than an inch in diameter
blew through Virginia Saturday night, downing large trees and power
lines and leaving about 63,000 Virginia Power customers in the dark
at the height of the storm.
</P>
<P>
   During the moraining, the front had pulled an area of rain across
southerain Texas.
</P>
<P>
   It was the same front which produced widespread severe weather
across the southerain Plains, central Mississippi Valley and upper
Midwest late Friday and early Saturday, knocking out power to
thousands of customers.
</P>
<P>
   One person was killed when a torainado touched down Friday evening
in Texas, about 60 miles south of Dallas. In St. Nazianz, Wis.,
straight-line wind blowing at up to 110 mph and baseball-size hail
injured several people Friday night, local officials said. At least
two torainadoes were reported during the night in southerain Illinois,
and storms around Chicago caused flight delays and cancellations.
</P>
<P>
   Ahead of the cold front, afterainoon temperatures were in the 80s
and low 90s from southerain Texas to the Southeast and the mid
Atlantic region. Behind it, afterainoon readings were only in the 40s
across the upper Mississippi Valley and westerain Great Lakes.
</P>
<P>
   Another weather disturbance was centered off the West Coast
during the afterainoon.
</P>
<P>
   That system spread a few light showers across northerain
Califorainia and parts of southerain Oregon and northwesterain Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, a few light showers developed across the northerain
Plains from Montana to northerain Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's temperatures ranged from a moraining low of 15 at
Leadville, Colo., to a midday reading of 95 at Petersburg, Va. The
lowest wind chill was zero at Leadville and the highest midday heat
index was 103 at Petersburg.

<HEADLINE> Notes From Saturday's Games  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated PressAMERICAN LEAGUE:
Yankees-Tigers:
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK: LHP Andy Pettitte lasted 4 2-3 innings against the
Tigers. It marked the first time he's failed to go at least five
innings this year. ... Tino Martinez was 4-for-7 in the first two
games at Detroit this weekend. His 2-for-4 effort Saturday was his
team-leading 13th multi-hit game of the season. ... The Yankees are
2-6 at Detroit the last two seasons but have won 29 of their last
40 games overall against the Tigers.
</P>
<P>
   DETROIT: The Tigers won Saturday despite a tying a season high
with three errors, including two by 3B Dean Palmer. Only one of the
Yankees' three runs was earned, and Detroit has now allowed 23
unearned runs this season. ... Juan Encarnacion was 1-for-5 and has
hit safely in 30 of 34 games this season. He's the only Tiger who's
played every game. ... RHP Jeff Weaver has a 2.55 ERA in five
starts at Comerica Park.
Royals-Indians:
</P>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY: Ricky Bottalico is 3-for-7 in save situations after
blowing his fourth when Cleveland rallied to win 7-6 win in 12
innings Saturday. But unlike his previous three blown saves, the
Royals didn't bail him out by winning this time. ... OF Todd
Dunwoody, who severely sprained his right ankle during a spring
game against the Indians in Florida, began a 20-day rehab
assignment at Triple-A Omaha. ... Before Cleveland rallied in the
bottom of the 12th, Kansas City was threatening to win for the 11th
time this season in its final at-bat. The Royals won just 12 games
in their final at-bat the entire 1999 season.
</P>
<P>
   CLEVELAND: OF Manny Ramirez is batting .420 (21-for-50) with
five homers and 16 RBIs during his 12-game hitting streak. He
picked up an RBI in his ninth straight game Saturday, matching Al
Rosen's club record set from May 15-23, 1954. ... Closer Steve
Karsay pitched a season-high two innings in his 17th appearance,
striking out four. ... Cuban pitching prospect Danys Baez, signed
this winter to a $14 million contract, pitched seven shutout
innings for Kinston (A) in the Carolina League. He walked three and
struck out nine in improving to 2-2 with a 5.11 ERA. ... Bench
coach Grady Little, who is serving as Cleveland's manager while
Charlie Manuel recovers from colon surgery, said he expects Manuel
to visit the team in the next few days. However, Little thinks it
may still be another week before Manuel's back full-time. Manuel
was released from the hospital on Friday, one week after his colon
was reattached.
Red Sox-Orioles:
</P>
<P>
   BOSTON: When Mike Stanley, Scott Hatteberg and Donnie Sadler
homered in the eighth inning, it marked the second time this season
the Red Sox have hit three homers in an inning. Stanley, Trot Nixon
and Nomar Garciaparra homered in the same inning April 19 at
Detroit. ... Manager Jimy Williams moved Stanley from DH to first
base in the eighth inning, meaning reliever Derek Lowe had to bat.
He struck out looking. ... Hatteberg's home run was his first
extra-base hit of the year.
</P>
<P>
   BALTIMORE: For the first time this season -- and for the first
time since April 22, 1999 -- LF B.J. Surhoff did not bat third. He
was dropped to sixth, with 2B Delino DeShields replacing him in the
No. 3 spot. DeShields last batted in that position May 29, 1996
with Los Angeles. ... Starter Jason Johnson walked a career-high
six batters. ... The Orioles have dropped five straight at home.
... Before the game, the Orioles activated C Willie Morales, out
with a hyperextended left elbow, from the 15-day disabled list and
optioned him to Triple-A Rochester.
Blue Jays-Devil Rays:
</P>
<P>
   TORONTO: OF Shannon Stewart, out since April 29 with a strained
right hamstring, went 3-for-3 with a double and triple in a rehab
assignment for Class A Dunedin on Friday night. He worked out at
Tropicana Field and is expected to be activated Sunday ... Manager
Jim Fregosi, in his second season with the Blue Jays, will manage
his 2,000th game Sunday. He's also managed for the California
Angels (1978-81), Chicago White Sox (1986-88) and Philadelphia
Phillies (1993). He's sixth among active managers behind Tony La
Russa, Bobby Cox, Joe Torre, Tom Kelly and Lou Piniella.
</P>
<P>
   TAMPA BAY: LHP Mark Guthrie, obtained Friday in a trade that
sent OF Dave Martinez to the Chicago Cubs, joined the team and
36-year-old rookie reliever Jim Morris was optioned to Triple-A
Durham. OF Quinton McCracken was recalled from Durham and INF Tony
Graffanino was designated for assignment ... Tampa Bay has gone 67
games without being shut out, the longest streak in the AL ...
Dwight Gooden made the 403rd start of his career. He's sixth among
active pitchers behind Roger Clemens, Orel Hershiser, Greg Maddux,
Tom Glavine and Mike Morgan.
Twins-White Sox:
</P>
<P>
   MINNESOTA: Distracted? Apparently not Twins third baseman Corey
Koskie, who had four hits Friday night, including a game-winning
single. Koskie's wife, Shannon, is back in Minneapolis where she
was due to deliver their child last Thursday. ... Twins manager Tom
Kelly, who has held the post since 1986, giving him the most tenure
of any manager or head coach in professional sports, has an admirer
in Chicago skipper Jerry Manuel. Manuel said when he first got his
job three years ago, Kelly greeted him warmly. So Manuel made sure
that when the Twins arrived Friday for the start of a three-game
series, he went to Kelly and congratulated him on getting his
1,000th career victory earlier this season. ''He's been through
good times and bad times and maintained the same demeanor,'' Manuel
said. ... Five of the Twins previous 12 games before Saturday went
to extra innings.
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO: The slumping White Sox had a team meeting before
Saturday night's game. ''I don't like meetings personally at all,''
Chicago manager Jerry Manuel said. ''I just thought we had some
issues we needed to discuss with a trip coming up.'' The White Sox
embark on a trip to New York and Toronto next week. ... Certainly
one issue the White Sox must continue to address is defense. In its
first 35 games, Chicago had 38 errors. First baseman Paul Konerko
missed a ground ball in the 10th inning Friday night -- it was
scored a hit -- to let the winning run score. ''We have the players
to be better defensively,'' Manuel said. ''We have to understand
that eventually a sign of how good we are is how we catch the ball
in close games.''
Mariners-Athletics:
</P>
<P>
   SEATTLE: Seattle pinch-hitters are 3-for-19 (.158) without an
RBI this season. The Mariners went without a pinch hit between
April 18 and May 10 (0-for-9).
</P>
<P>
   OAKLAND: 2B Frank Menechino was sent down to Triple-A Sacramento
of the Pacific Coast League, but not because of anything h from the disabled
list to start Saturday's game.
Menechino hit .293 with four homers and 16 RBIs with the A's. ...
1B Olmedo Saenz, who left Friday night's game in the second inning,
was diagnosed with a slight sprain in his right ankle, better than
expected. ''I thought he would be out for a couple weeks,'' said
Howe. ''We dodged a bullet.'' Saenz did not play Saturday and is
listed day-to-day.
Rangers is also scheduled to go on a rehab assignment to Tulsa on
Monday, almost a month after arthroscopic surgery for bone spurs in
his right ankle. ... When the Rangers won Friday night 13-11 behind
four homers and the Angels countered with five, it represented a
new club record for a road game; the previous high of eight had
been done three times.
</P>
<P>
   ANAHEIM: C Bengie Molina, who had a two-homer game Friday night,
had hit just one home run in 190 previous big-league at-bats. ...
LHP Jarrod Washburn became the Angels' seventh different starter in
38 games Saturday night.
NATIONAL LEAGUE:
Cubs-Expos:
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO: RHP Todd Van Poppel became the 14th player to make his
Cubs debut this season when he pitched 2 2-3 innings in relief of
Kerry Wood in Friday night's 8-3 loss to the Expos. ... Newly
acquired OF Dave Martinez is expected to join the team Sunday in
Montreal. Martinez, who was acquired from Tampa Bay Friday for LHP
Mark Guthrie and cash, will wear the No. 1, as he did during his
first stint with the Cubs from 1986-88.
</P>
<P>
   MONTREAL: Relievers Ugueth Urbina and Scott Strickland are both
scheduled to have surgery on their ailing right arms next
Wednesday, though Strickland threw long toss without any pain in
his shoulder prior to Saturday night's game. Strickland will throw
on the side Sunday. He had planned to consult Dr. James Andrews on
Monday for a second opinion to the MRI reading which determined
that he had a torn labrum. The results of the arthrogram performed
on Urbina's right elbow will be reviewed further on Monday. ... 2B
Jose Vidro tied his career-best hitting streak when he singled in
the first Friday to extend his current streak to 10 games. Vidro
also hit in 10 straight last May 25 to June 6.
Braves-Phillies:
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA: The Braves' 8-7 victory over the Phillies on Friday
night was their first after trailing going into the eighth inning.
They had lost the first nine times they trailed that late in the
game. ... Rudy Seanez surrendered his first grand slam in the
seventh inning of that game when Scott Rolen moved the Phillies
ahead 7-6. Seanez had pitched 194 innings in 188 games without
allowing that feat. ... Prior to Saturday's game the Braves
activated Kevin McGlinchy after his rehab assignment in Greenville
and sent relief pitcher Kerry Ligtenberg to Triple-A Richmond.
</P>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA: The Phillies have not won a series against the
Braves at home sine April 1998. ... Judy Wolf, mother of Phillies
pitcher Randy, was in attendance for the Braves series, compliments
of the team. The Phillies reinstituted an old tradition of flying
in a player's mother for a series during Mother's Day weekend. Judy
Wolf, whose name was selected at random, came to Philadelphia from
her home in Canoga Park, Calif., where Randy still lives during the
off-season. ...
Brewers-Pirates:
</P>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE: Brewers starting pitchers are averaging just 5 1-3
innings per game. The staff could get a couple of additions soon.
RHPs John Snyder and Jamey Wright are on rehab at Triple-A
Indianapolis and could be back soon. Both went on the disabled list
on March 28 -- Snyder with a left oblique muscle strain and Wright
with a right shoulder injury.
</P>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH: SS Pat Meares left Friday's game in the sixth inning
because of the flu and was unavailable for Saturday's game. ...
Brian O'Connor made his major league debut as Saturday's starter
and was the 16th pitcher used by the Pirates this season. O'Connor
is the first starting pitcher to be called up from Double-A by the
Pirates since Steve Parris in 1995.
Marlins-Mets:
</P>
<P>
   FLORIDA: Closer Antonio Alfonseca has saved all four games
during the Marlins' current winning streak. Florida manager John
Boles said he won't pitch Sunday and that Braden Looper will be
given the day off, too. ... Preston Wilson had four RBIs for the
second straight game, again matching his career high. He has an
eight-game hitting streak and five homers in his last eight games.
''You feel relaxed,'' he said. ''You have a very confident feeling.
Everything is a little bit slower than it usually is.''
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK: The Mets have homered in five straight games for the
first time this year and have 18 in their last 13 games. ... Mike
Hampton was the first Mets' pitcher to pinch hit since Pat Mahomes,
who struck out at Houston last Aug. 30. Hampton is 4-for-18 (.222)
at the plate this season. ... ... Hampton (3-4) pitches against
Brad Penny (3-4) in Sunday's series finale.
Reds-Astros:
</P>
<P>
   CINCINNATI: The Reds purchased the contract of RHP Osvaldo
Fernandez from Double-A Chattanooga of the Southern League. He took
Pete Harnisch's spot on the roster and started Saturday against the
Astros. Harnisch has been on the disabled list since May 5 due to
weakness in the rotator cuff of his right shoulder. He is
undergoing a strengthening program and is expected to miss 3-4
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   HOUSTON: RHP Shane Reynolds (5-0) had his next start pushed back
one day because of slight stiffness in his shoulder. Reynolds will
pitch Tuesday at Milwaukee and RHP Jose Lima, originally scheduled
to pitch Tuesday, will pitch Monday night against the Reds. ... SS
Tim Bogar returned to the starting lineup for the first time since
May 5. Bogar was benched because of a hitting slump. He is hitting
.132.
Dodgers-Cardinals:
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES: The Dodgers and Cardinals entered Saturday's game
tied with 103 victories apiece at Busch Stadium. ... The Dodgers'
13-0 victory Friday was their widest margin of victory in a shutout
since Sept. 24, 1975, when Doug Rau beat San Diego 14-0. ... The
Dodgers hit 56 homers in their first 34 games. Last year they had
39 over the same span. ... Carlos Perez, who makes his seventh
start on Sunday, is 3-0 in his last six appearances with a 3.89
ERA. ... Catcher Todd Hundley, who did not start Saturday, has
thrown out only two of 20 basestealers.
</P>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS: Trainer Barry Weinberg said third baseman Fernando
Tatis has made no progress with a groin injury that landed him on
the disabled list April 30. Weinberg said Tatis, who was leading
the NL with 28 RBIs when he was hurt, won't be back until the
All-Star break at the earliest. ''It's like Uncle Joe. He's kind of
slow at the Junction,'' Weinberg said. ... LF Ray Lankford was back
in the lineup, a day after leaving due to blurred vision after
one-half of an inning. Lankford's eyes were dilated during an
examination Thursday. ... The Cardinals are being patient with
reliever Darren Holmes, who allowed seven earned runs in 4 1-3
innings his first three appearances. Pitching coach Dave Duncan
pointed out that Holmes hadn't pitched in 22 days before his first
outing with St. Louis. ''You kind of have to give him the benefit
of the doubt,'' Duncan said. ''To give him a fair evaluation, we
have to let him pitch some more.''
Giants-Rockies:
</P>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO: OF Ellis Burks was placed on the 15-day disabled
list retroactive to May 9 with a strained left quadriceps. To
replace him, Terrell Lowery's contract was purchased from Triple-A
Fresno. ... 3B Bill Mueller extended his hitting streak to 10
games. ... Armando Rios' last five homers have come at Coors Field.
He hit two on Oct. 2, two more Friday night and one Saturday.
''Here, I feel like I'm 6-2,'' the 5-foot-9 outfielder said. ...
Barry Bonds became the sixth player to reach the third deck at
Coors Field with his 457-foot homer in the seventh. He left the
game with a back injury in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   COLORADO: The Rockies placed OF Larry Walker on the 15-day
disabled list. He is expected to miss at least a month with a
stress fracture in his right elbow. Colorado purchased Bubba
Carpenter's contract from Triple-A Colorado Springs and moved RHP
Jerry Dipoto to the 60-day disabled list. Carpenter, a career minor
leaguer, had a pinch-single in his major league debut. ''You work
for nine years for that. It just feels good to get it over with,''
he said. ... Todd Helton fouled off nine pitches with two strikes
before hitting his 13th homer of the season in the sixth. ... With
10 runs Saturday, the Rockies scored in double figures for the
sixth straight home game. They have scored 79 runs in that stretch
(13.2 per game).
Diamondbacks-Padres:
</P>
<P>
   ARIZONA: Injured 3B Matt Williams received a pair of
specially-designed baseball shoes from Padres RF Tony Gwynn.
Williams, on the disabled list since March 29 with a fractured
second metatarsal, got the shoes before Friday's series opener
after telling Gwynn that his heel was bothering him. Gwynn, on the
disabled list with inflammation in his left knee, has worn shoes
with more padding than normal baseball shoes the past several
seasons. ... Ed Sprague's three-run homer allowed by LHP Greg
Swindell on Friday night was one of the bullpen's rare ineffective

Diamondbacks relievers had given up only two earned runs over 25

   SAN DIEGO: RHP Rodney Myers underwent successful surgery
Saturday to repair the torn patellar tendon in his left knee that
he suffered Thursday on the artificial turf in Cincinnati. Myers,
placed on the 60-day disabled list Friday, is expected to be out
for the season. ... CF Ruben Rivera may be running out of time to
prove he can hit major league pitching. Rivera, the key part of the
Hideki Irabu trade with the Yankees in 1997, has been a bust
offensively. Rivera, one of the NL's top defensive center fielders,
is hitting just .195 since becoming a regular in 1999. ''This is a
big year for Ruben,'' GM Kevin Towers said.

   NEW YORK (AP) -- In her first public comments since accusing a
superior of sexual harassment, the Army's highest-ranking female
officer said women in the military who face harassment should
report it immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ''If discrimination or misconduct is not reported at an
appropriate time, then public policy may never change,'' Lt. Gen.
Claudia J. Kennedy said Friday at a ceremony honoring her 31 years
of military service.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy did not make any direct reference to her case in remarks
before more than 100 people at the memorial to Women in Military
Service to America, which adjoins Arlington National Cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy has accused Maj. Gen. Larry G. Smith of making unwanted
sexual advances in 1996. She did not report the alleged incident to
her superiors at the time, raising her allegations only last fall,
when the Army appointed Smith to be deputy inspector general. In
that post he would have investigated cases of sexual harassment.
</P>
<P>
   Her charge has been substantiated by Army investigators, senior
defense officials said last week. That finding will be reviewed by
the Army's vice chief of staff, Gen. John Keane, who will determine
whether to take disciplinary action against Smith.
</P>
<P>
   In her remarks Friday, Kennedy quoted French novelist Emile Zola
that he lived on earth ''to live out loud.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Living out loud begins by telling a friend and then later
telling people in authority who care,'' The New York Times quoted
her as saying. ''Our army is filled with women and men who care and
are in a position to change and improve the conditions in which we
serve.''
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, the Army's deputy chief of staff for intelligence, is
due to retire in June.
