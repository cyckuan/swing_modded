<HEADLINE> GM Crop Can Help Environment: Research </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Some crops which have been
genetically modified (GM) to produce pesticides may have an
"environmental advantage" over sprays, because they do not harm
useful insects, according to UK researchers.
</P>
<P>
The team at the Institute of Arable Crops Research (IACR),
Hertfordshire, showed that GM oilseed rape which produces the Bt
(Bacillus thuringiensis) toxin does not harm a wasp which kills a
pest moth. Nor did the crop prevent the parasitic wasp finding the
moth's larvae.
</P>
<P>
The scientists conclude that the GM rape, which allows the
wasps to continue killing the moths, may therefore be better for
the environment than insecticide sprays, which kill both the moths
and the wasps, according to a BBC report.
</P>
<P>
Their work appears to contrast with the discovery in May that
pollen from one GM corn crop can kill the larvae of monarch
butterflies. That discovery was made by a team at Cornell
University, who said it showed an urgent need for more research on
the environmental risks of biotechnology in farming.
</P>
<P>
The IACR researchers, led by Dr Guy Poppy, said their work
showed that the behavior of non-target insects can be as important
as toxicity in determining the impact of GM plants.
</P>
<P>
The new evidence was published in the science journal Nature.
The laboratory-based experiment involved GM oilseed rape, the
diamondback moth (Plutella xylostella) that damages the crop, and
the parasitic wasp (Cotesia plutellae), which kills the moths'
caterpillars by laying its eggs in them.
</P>
<P>
The GM rape was modified to produce the same Bt toxins used in
the Cornell study. The diamondback moth has gained notoriety for
being the first insect pest to evolve resistance to Bt sprays in
the field.
</P>
<P>
One experiment allowed adult wasps to lay their eggs in the
larvae of highly Bt-resistant moths, which had been fed on the Bt
rape. But the presence of the toxins in the moth larvae made no
difference to the survival rates of the wasps, as larvae or
adults.
</P>
<P>
The parasitic wasps only find their host moths thanks to a
chemical "alarm bell" released by the plant when its leaves are
damaged. So in another experiment the team used a wind tunnel to
see if the wasps would make a distinction between Bt rape and wild
rape.
</P>
<P>
Overall, when the damage to the two sorts of rape was
equivalent, the wasps showed no significant preference for either
sort of leaf.
</P>
<P>
Based on their experiments, the IACR team believe that the
continued ability of the wasps to locate and lay their eggs in
Bt-resistant larvae on transgenic crops might even help to
constrain the spread of genes for Bt resistance in the moths.
</P>
<P>
"Our results highlight the need to consider behavioral as well
as toxicological aspects when looking at possible side effects of
transgenic crops on non-target organisms," BBC quoted a spokesman
of the team as saying.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Trade Union to Press for Salary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe Congress of Trade
Unions (ZCTU) Wednesday said it will soon resort to industrial
action to press the government to increase the minimum wage from
1,500 Zimbabwean dollars (39 U. S. dollars) to 4,000 Zimbabwean
dollars (105 U.S. dollars) per month.
</P>
<P>
ZCTU President Gibson Sibanda told a labor forum in Bulawayo,
the country's second largest city that the average 35 percent that
was awarded to most workers during the just ended collective
bargaining was no longer useful because of the increase of the
prices of basic commodities.
</P>
<P>
"If the government does not heed our call to increase the
minimum wage then we will do what we know best to resume our
stayaways," he said, adding that workers also needed further
adjustments of their salaries since government ministers were
recently awarded hefty increments.
</P>
<P>
Government ministers' salaries were recently increased by 182
percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Sibanda said since the economic situation kept on
worsening for the workers, the ZCTU leadership had decided to
facilitate the formation of a labor party to be called Movement
for Democratic Change (MDC) .
</P>
<P>
"On September 11 the MDC will be born and the whole world will
know about it," he said.
</P>
<P>
Sibanda said all the ground work to facilitate the formation of
the party had been completed.
</P>
<P>
"We have set up structures at both residential and work
places," he said, adding that the party's cards had already been
printed.
</P>
<P>
Sibanda said the workers had decided to form their own party
because the present government was not concerned about their
plight.

<HEADLINE> Namibian, S. African Presidents Launch Electricity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Namibian President Sam
Nujoma and South African President Thabo Mbeki Wednesday launched
a 400-kilovolt electricity transmission line in Keetmanshoop,
southern Namibia, the Namibian Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
The multi-million-rand transmission line will channel power
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"This new, state-of-the-art transmission line will strengthen
the economies and common bonds not just of South Africa and
Namibia, but of the Southern African Development Community (SADC)
region as a whole," Nujoma was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Our countries have been unwavering in our support of SADC as
the engine of southern African development and unity. From this
day onward, the region will be bound together by an integrated
electricity network," said the Namibian president.
</P>
<P>
Nujoma said that the network would permit large trading of
power from the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the north to
the continent's southern tip, and from Namibia in the west to the
southern African shore of the Indian Ocean in the east.
</P>
<P>
The Namibian president said he believed the project would
improve his country's long-term price of power for all customers
and help fulfil the government's commitment to bringing
electricity to all corners of the country, including the
previously neglected rural communities.

<HEADLINE> UK Rate Outlook Shows Mixed Picture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. interest rate hike
Tuesday appeared to have done little to change the odds of
near-term rate hikes in the U.K. and Europe, according to British
analysts.
</P>
<P>
While the UK's Monetary Policy Council (MPC) and the European
Central Bank (ECB) are grappling with the same issues that
prompted the U.S. hike, the same urgency does not exist.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. hike was largely driven by concern over future wage
inflation and low unemployment, which reached a record low of 4.3
percent in July.
</P>
<P>
Unemployment is much higher, and growth much lower, in Europe
than in the United States. And inflation is, if anything, more
restrained on the European continent.
</P>
<P>
The UK stands somewhere between the two regions, with more
inflationary pressures and lower unemployment than in Europe, but
weak growth.
</P>
<P>
The decision to leave UK interest rates unchanged at 5 percent
last month was a unanimous one, analysts say. But there were sharp
differences between the nine members of the committee over the
likely future path of interest rate levels, according to local
media reports.
</P>
<P>
Some argued that with inflation below the government target of
2.5 percent, rates should be cut, while others said rising house
prices called for a rate hike.
</P>
<P>
Forecasters, including the National Institute for Economic and
Social Research, have suggested that inflation might fall as low
as 1.5 percent, forcing the bank to lower rates further.
</P>
<P>
"Although there's no mood of global coordination, we do expect
the ECB to raise rates in September, probably by half a point, and
the MPC to lift rates a quarter point the following month,"
Dresdner Kleinwort Benson equity strategist Philip Isherwood was
quoted by a BBC report as saying.
</P>
<P>
"They are now in the same position as the Fed, sitting watching
data coming in quite strongly," he said.
</P>
<P>
The picture is equally mixed in Europe, where rates were last
cut by 0.5 percent to 2.5 percent in April. While a rate increase
is expected, it might not happen until next year.
</P>
<P>
Rising prosperity, the doubling of the price of oil since
January and an upward trend in wage costs are all pushing prices
up. Inflation rose to 1.1 percent in July from 0.9 percent in
June. The question is when will the ECB think it necessary to act.
</P>
<P>
While Deutsche Bank expects the ECB to sit tight on interest
rates until the first quarter of next year, they admit monetary
tightening is possible this year if growth overshoots 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
European markets have been subdued in their response to the
rate hike, with some still wary of a further U.S. tightening. Some
may now direct their funds to U.S. markets.
</P>
<P>
"For European investors, the important thing is that the U.S.
economy continues to grow," an economist at American Express Bank
was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve could hike rates further in order to cool
growth later in the year, as so far the U.S. economy shows little
sign of cooling off.
</P>
<P>
But whatever it decides to do, it appears that the current
interest rate cycle is drawing to a close, and the next move will
inevitably be higher, a BBC analysis said.

<HEADLINE> CIS Air War Game Draws Lesson From Balkan War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The ongoing CIS air defense
exercise will take into account the experience of the recent
hostilities in Yugoslavia, Commander in Chief of the Russian Air
Force Anatoly Kornukov said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"For the first time, the mobility of air defense systems will
be checked," Kornukov said in Ashuluk of the Astrakhan region, the
Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"We will definitely exercise in changing air defense system
positions. In addition, combat tasks will be carried out in
conditions of artificial disturbances," he added.
</P>
<P>
"Combat information to air defense systems will be fed from an
AN-50 radar reconnaissance and guidance plane," Kornukov said of
the war games, which involve air force troops from Russia,
Belarus, Armenia, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan.
</P>
<P>
Defense ministers from the five countries, all members of the
12-member Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), have arrived
in Astrakhan to watch the exercise that will involve 2,400 troops
including support formations.
</P>
<P>
Defense chiefs from Ukraine and Uzbekistan, and a
representative of the Georgian Defense Ministry, will also attend
as observers. The three countries are also CIS members.
</P>
<P>
"For the first time by way of psychological preparation attack
aviation will deliver ground strikes so that servicemen will know
that if the task is not fulfilled, an air strike will destroy
their positions," he said.
</P>
<P>
Besides hitting air targets, S-300 air defense systems will
attack ground targets to halt the breakthrough of a sabotage group
of the imaginary enemy.
</P>
<P>
"Sukhoi-24 frontline bombers and Sukhoi-25 attack bombers will
hit positions to completely destroy the saboteurs," Kornukov said.
</P>
<P>
The exercises, code-named Combat Commonwealth '99, will
rehearse the joint efforts of air defense units and fighter
aviation to prevent violations of CIS air space.
</P>
<P>
Kornukov said the air targets will simulate both combat planes
and cruise missiles, including Tomahawks.

<HEADLINE> German Cabinet Passes Austerity Fiscal Reform Draft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Under protests of unions and party
left-wingers, Germany's red-green coalition cabinet led by
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder Wednesday at its session in Berlin
officially approved a sweeping fiscal reform package to become
draft law.
</P>
<P>
The draft, raised by Finance Minister Hans Eichel and backed by
Schroeder, will mean to cut Germany's federal budget by 30.4
billion marks in the year 2000 and more in the next years. Pension,
jobless relief, public health and other social welfare paying
will be strictly limited to grow with the inflation rate under the
package.
</P>
<P>
More than a dozen areas of Germany's federal spending, even
including salary standard of 1.7 million officials and financial
aid to artists, will be affected by the comprehensive reform after
it is passed by parliament in September.
</P>
<P>
The draft with the name of "Sparing Package" is aimed to cut
the country's spending by 38.6 billion marks in the year 2001,
42.2 billion in 2002, and 49.5 billion in the year following.
Connected with the drastic budget saving will be a relief to the
tax burden of German enterprises and citizens.
</P>
<P>
Germany's influential unions, which have been continuously
attacking the package since Eichel put it forth in June, said they
would take up massive resistance against the draft. Even the
German official union that represents the public servants forged a
bitter protest to the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Inside Germany's ruling coalition, left-wingers of both parties
including some high-ranking officials also criticize their
chancellor openly. The coalition is made up of Schroeder's Social
Democratic Party (SPD) and its junior partner, the Greens party
led by Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer.
</P>
<P>
However, Schroeder and Eichel rejected any compromise with the
opponents. They said the reform was a "bitter medicine" necessary
for Germany.
</P>
<P>
After the last-minute failure of talks between the SPD and the
unions, Schroeder told his Labor Minister Walter Riester Wednesday
that there was no alternative for the government, and his cabinet
would "stick to its plan."
</P>
<P>
Eichel echoed the chancellor's remarks by saying the cabinet
was "determined" and the reforms was not "socially unjust" as the
unions had called.
</P>
<P>
With four regional elections scheduled for next month, it is
afraid the SPD will bear heavy loss in votes with the
controversial reforms. The elections in Saarland, Brandenburg,
Thuringia and Saxony have been regarded as a key test of
popularity to Schroeder's cabinet.

<HEADLINE> UK Logs on to E-Commerce: Surveys </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Britain is experiencing an
e-commerce boom, with growing numbers going online to do their
shopping or manage their finances, according to local median
reports.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey by management consultants Datamonitor said that
online shopping and banking are becoming increasingly popular, as
more than one in five consumers with access to the Internet have
ordered products online, while 8 percent of those surveyed used
the Net to monitor their finances.
</P>
<P>
Internet share trading is showing rapid growth too, up by
21,555 users in the second quarter of 1999, according to a
separate survey by the Association of Private Client Investment
Managers and Stockbrokers (APCIMS).
</P>
<P>
The level of e-commerce penetration was particularly high in
London, where almost one in two people have access to a computer
at home. In the capital, 27 percent of Net users had shopped
online, the report said.
</P>
<P>
"One in four Londoners online at home or work order products
via the Internet," Datamonitor analyst Alexander Rainer said.
"This figure is surprisingly high, considering a minority of UK
Websites currently have transactional capabilities. "
</P>
<P>
However, for Internet banking, rural areas proved the most
fertile territory, with the highest rate of use in East Anglia, at
14 percent.
</P>
<P>
"Rural regions such as East Anglia and Scotland appear to have
the biggest appetite for online banking as many consumers live far
from their branch," a BBC report quoted Rainer as saying. "Where
people live in a more pressured working environment, like in
London, online banking is driven by the convenience of 24-hour
availabililty."
</P>
<P>
The separate APCIMS survey showed that Internet share trading
rose by nearly 60 percent in the last quarter. However, it still
only accounts for 1.6 percent of all trades, the association said.
</P>
<P>
Online trades averaged a value of 4,730 pounds, compared to
6,444 pounds for trades through other stockbrokers.
</P>
<P>
The growth in Internet trading is expected to increase in the
coming months, as more brokers develop the capacity to trade
online, according to analysts.

</P>
<P>
SEVILLE, August 25 (Xinhua) -- World record holder Colin Jackson won
the first gold medal for Britain when he won the men's 110m hurdles at
the World Athletics Championships here Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
The veteran hurlder only sprinted to surge ahead at the final point
to cross the finishing line first at 13.04 seconds for his second world
gold medal. Anier Garcia of Cuba was second at 13.07 and Duane Ross of
the United States finished third at 13.12.
</P>
<P>
Jackson, 32, set the world record of 12.91 seconds at the 93 World
Championships in Stuggart, Germany.
</P>
<P>
"To come back to the world championships and to return to gold again
is superb," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I felt confident and I knew I was in excellent condition and that
the key to my race would be to relax," added the Briton.
</P>
<P>
However, it was a terrible race for Ameircan hurdler Ross, who
tumbled down several hurdles before making it right for the bronze
medal.
</P>
<P>
"I feel terrible. I was too sloppy and hit too many hurdles, finally
right at the last one," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I was right there with Jackson before all went wrong. I must get
him the next time," added the American.
</P>
<P>
Defending champion Allen Johnson of the United States, top favourite
before the competitions, pulled out of the race after he sustained calf
injury Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> American Airlines Staff Arrested For Drug Smuggling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 25 (Xinhua) -- U.S. authorities Wednesday
arrested 58 American Airlines employees and contract workers on
charges of smuggling drugs and weapons, officials said.
</P>
<P>
The arrests were made after a two-year undercover sting
operation called "Operation Ramp Rats" found that airport workers
were smuggling cocaine, marijuana, weapons and explosives, said
Brent Eaton, a spokesman for the U.S. Drug Enforcement
Administration.
</P>
<P>
They are accused of smuggling drugs from South America through
the baggage system at Miami International Airport into the United
States and also acting as couriers within the United States and
delivering drugs from Miami to other cities.
</P>
<P>
The people indicted were mainly ramp workers and baggage
handlers, officials said.
</P>
<P>
The suspects used their security clearances to get drugs,
handguns and explosives provided by the agents onto airport ramps,
where it was loaded onto planes.
</P>
<P>
American Airlines, the largest carrier servicing Latin America,
issued a statement Wednesday from its headquarters in Texas,
saying the company has cooperated in the investigation.
</P>
<P>
"While we are disturbed that a small group of employees were
part of this smuggling ring, their activities have been under
federal government and company surveillance for quite some time,"
the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The company was not expecting any disruption of service,
American Airlines spokeswoman Martha Pantin said.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Cyprus' Cabinet Reshuffled for Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot President Glafcos
Clerides announced a cabinet reshuffle Wednesday, in a move to
improve the government's efficiency and its image among the people.
</P>
<P>
Three new ministers and a government spokesman took up their
posts Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Reshuffle reports have been circulating in Cyprus newspapers
for months as the government has been troubled by low popularity.
</P>
<P>
Clerides had planned to delay the reshuffle until November, but
persistent speculation about who would be axed prompted former
Defense Minister Yiannakis Chrysostomis and government spokesman
Costas Serezis to resign before they were fired.
</P>
<P>
Chrysostomis, who took office in January, threatened to resign
in July after allegations that he had been lavishly entertained by
an international arms manufacturer in Paris.
</P>
<P>
During his term in office, Chrysostomis also upset senior Greek
army officers and came under fire for the fact that the National
Guard's Russian T-80 tanks had been running on the wrong fuel.
</P>
<P>
Serezis, who became government spokesman in March, never
managed to gain the respect of the media that accused him of
poor-briefing and lacking the eloquence to talk an unpopular
government out of trouble.
</P>
<P>
Leontios Ierodiakonou, Minister of Communications and Works,
resigned last month to work for a foreign university.
</P>
<P>
With those three leaving voluntarily, Health Minister Christos
Solomis, who was also considered as unpopular, became the only
cabinet member to get the chop.
</P>
<P>
Plagued by scandals and allegations of incompetence, the
former cabinet had consistently hit rock bottom in public opinion
polls and was considered as one of Cyprus' most unpopular
government ever.
</P>
<P>
It had been constantly criticized for lack of coordination and
uneffective function.
</P>
<P>
People complained that the government had failed to work out an
effective water policy in view of years of drought and to have its
ever-changing tax package passed by the Parliament despite of
more-than-one-year efforts.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus' fiscal deficit is standing at a worrying 6 percent of
Gross Domestic Product and its foreign debt is rising, but the
government has not developed a long-term policy to cut the
crippling public sector wage bill.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the liberalization of interest rates remained a
soap opera without end due to the government's inability to
secure support for the bill.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the negative effects of the transfer of the
Russian S-300 anti-aircraft missiles to Greece's Crete island
under intense international pressure are still haunting the
country.
</P>
<P>
The missiles Cyprus ordered from Russia in 1997 were transferred
to Greece's Crete island following Turkey's threat to launch
preemptive attacks on Cyprus if the missiles were deployed on the
island.
</P>
<P>
Turkey is the strong supporter of the separatist Turkish
Cypriots who unilaterally declared a republic in northern Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
With the reshuffle, the Cyprus' president hoped to form a
government that will function effectively and will be coordinated
and geared to the implementation of the government promises.

<HEADLINE> China Sees Conflict Prevention as Best Way to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The fundamental way to
protect children in armed conflict is to effectively prevent, stop
and eliminate armed conflict, and the United Nations should make
greater input in this regard, a senior Chinese diplomat said here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Shen Guofang, deputy Chinese permanent representative to the
United Nations, made the statement at an open debate held at the
U.N. Security Council on the protection of children in armed
conflict.
</P>
<P>
"It is very regrettable that we have not been able to achieve
this," he said. "We believe the United Nations should make greater
input in this regard."
</P>
<P>
"Children, as one of the most vulnerable social groups, are hit
the hardest" in armed conflict, he said.
</P>
<P>
The international community should adopt effective measures and
urge the parties concerned to bring an early end to conflict
through peaceful means, and demand that they abide by various
international laws, including the international humanitarian law,
to prevent and prohibit various violent harm against children in
armed conflict, and try to provide necessary protection and
assistance to children, so that they can resume normal life and
schooling at an early date, he said.
</P>
<P>
"In the situation of conflict, not only they can lead a normal
life and receive the education they deserve, but also they are
constantly exposed to the danger of death, their psychological and
physical health have been greatly impaired," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Children are the future of the world," he said. "The
predicament of children in armed conflict as well as their
implications have received extensive concerns from the
international community," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We call upon the international community, relevant
international organizations, and the concerned agencies of the
United Nations in particular, to further strengthen their
coordination and cooperation, and join hands in a greater effort
to solve the problem of children in armed conflict," he said.
</P>
<P>
"China has always attached greater importance to the problem of
the protection of children," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Shen voiced his appreciation of the effort by Olara
Otunnu, the U.N. special representative for children and armed
conflict.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the question of the protection of children in
armed conflict covers many aspects and is highly technical in
nature. Therefore, the General Assembly and the United Nations
Economic and Social Commission are the proper forum, where more
comprehensive and in-depth consideration can be conducted, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that while deliberating the issue of the protection
of children in armed conflict, the Security Council should also
carry out discussions on such issues as how to end conflict and
defuse crisis, which lie in the crux of the problem," he said.

AMMAN, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian King Abdullah Bin
Hussein Wednesday called for early resumption of Arab-Israeli
talks on all tracks to make tangible progress in the Middle East
peace process.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah made the appeal during his meeting with Dutch Foreign
Minister Jozias Van Aarts who arrived here earlier in the day for
a two-day official visit over bilateral ties and Middle East
affairs.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah also called on Israel and the Palestinians to abide
by all agreements already signed to move forward the peace
process in the region, Jordan's official news agency Petra said.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian side also briefed Aarts on the latest efforts to
revive peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians, Syria
and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah praised the European Union (EU) for its efforts to
break the deadlock in the peace process and its contributions to
the economic development in the region.
</P>
<P>
Aarts reiterated that his country supports all efforts to
achieve peace in the region and praised Abdullah for his role to
narrow the differences between Israel and its Arab neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Aarts came to Amman after his Norwegian counterpart Knut
Vollebaek paid a one-day visit to Jordan on Tuesday over the
Middle East peace process and bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Analysts in Amman said the intensified diplomatic efforts
by European countries are aimed at highlighting the EU's role
as a major peace broker in the region after Ehud Barak came to
power in Israel in the May elections.
</P>
<P>
During the elections, Barak defeated his predecessor Benjamin
Netanyahu, whose hardline policies during his three years in
office led to the current deadlock in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Barak had vowed to revive peace talks between Israel, the
Palestinians, Syria and Lebanon after he took office, marking a
breakaway from the hardline policies of Netanyahu.

HARARE, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean Government
Wednesday dismissed speculation that the Netherlands government is
cutting aid to Zimbabwe because of bad governance.
</P>
<P>
"What is happening is that the Netherlands government is
reducing its aid to poor countries," said Acting Finance Minister
Emmerson Mnangagwa in an interview with the Zimbabwe News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The acting minister said Netherlands has cut its aid countries
from 78 to 18 in the past several year.

The weekly Zimbabwe Independent reported that the Netherlands,
a key sponsor of Zimbabwe's development programs, had cancelled
aid to the country in an apparent show of no confidence in the
policies of President Robert Mugabe's government.

The paper quoted a spokesman for the Netherlands Ministry of
Foreign Affairs as saying Zimbabwe had been removed from the list
of countries to benefit from bilateral aid which is granted on a
government to government level.
</P>
<P>
The acting minister said, "The move by the Netherlands
government is a reduction of world-wide aid to poor countries and
there is no cause for alarm based on speculation."

<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Thirty non-governmental
organizations (NGOs) have suspended their support for displaced
people in the Uige Province of Angola due to the unstable military
situation in the region.
</P>
<P>
Among the 30 NGOs operating in the province, only the Denmark
Council for Refugees and the Young Christian Association are still
working, Provincial Director of the United Nations Humanitarian
Assistance Coordination Unit (UCAH) Bambi Barros was quoted by
official news agency Angop as saying Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the operation of NGOs in the war-torn
province of northeast Angola is financed by the subsidiary
organizations of the United Nations, such as the World Food
Programme (WFP) and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF).
</P>
<P>
According to the Ministry of Assistance and Reintegration, the
number of displaced people in the Uige Province has reached

<HEADLINE> Asylum Applications to Britain Reach Record High in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 25 (Xinhua) -- A record 6,600 asylum seekers
arrived in Britain last month, the highest number ever for a
single month, the Home Office said Wednesday,
</P>
<P>
Home Office figures showed the asylum applications surged from
an average 4,000 a month last year.
</P>
<P>
The biggest group of applicants in July -- 1,340 -- came from
the former Yugoslavia, with Somalis being the next biggest group.
</P>
<P>
The figures revealed that while the number of applications
rose, the pace of decision-making slowed.
</P>
<P>
Home Secretary Jack Straw has denied the immigration system is
crumbling in the face of the stream of asylum seekers, saying
Britain was the 11th out of 15 European Union countries in terms
of asylum seekers as a proportion of population.
</P>
<P>
But the immigration service union said its members cannot cope
with the influx.
</P>
<P>
Tensions over immigration flared into clashes which injured 11
people earlier this month in the Channel port of Dover, where 800
asylum seekers are living among the town's 41,000 residents.
</P>
<P>
Straw said the government had responded by putting 120 million
pounds (194 million U.S. dollars) into turning the system around
over the next three years and recruiting an extra 600 staff.

<HEADLINE> Rising Trend For Company Profits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Company profits are on a rising
trend in the three largest stock market areas: the U.S., Japan and
Euroland according to a paper by Economics for Investment, an
economics and finance publication here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
U.S. reported earnings per share look set to increase by 9
percent year-on-year by December 1999 and at a similar rate in
future years, assuming there is no recession.
</P>
<P>
But the bond/equity yield ratio is already high, suggesting
that the market is vulnerable if earnings disappoint, the paper
said.
</P>
<P>
Japanese profits have been severely squeezed by the recession
but are expected to rebound strongly over the next 18 months as
the economy picks up and the regional upswing continues.
</P>
<P>
In the longer term the scope for improved earnings is enormous,
partly because the return on capital is so low, at less than 4
percent compared with the U.S. at 16 percent, the research paper
said.

PARIS, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Moroccan security forces arrested
nine Islamists from Algeria after the latter killed 29 people and
injured three in an attack in southwest Algeria earlier this
month, Agence France-Presse quoted informed sources as saying
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Islamists were suspected of making a commando attack on
August 15 against a village called Beni Ounif in the region of
Bechar, which is 750 kilometers southwest of the Algerian capital
of Algiers.
</P>
<P>
They fled to Morocco and were arrested immediately, said the
sources.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Morocco and Algeria, which remained tense in
the past because of Algeria's support for the West Saharan
Polisario Front guerrillas, have begun to improve after Algerian
President Abdelaziz Bouteflika came to power in April.

<HEADLINE> PKK Declares Early Withdrawal from Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The outlawed Kurdish Workers'
Party (PKK) declared on Wednesday that it had started withdrawal
of its forces from Turkey as promised.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the PKK said the pullout, scheduled for
September 1, had been advanced due to last week's killer
earthquake in the country, Turkey's private NTV reported here
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that "to unilaterally stop the war at this
time of severe disaster is the greatest support to the state and
people of Turkey," adding an appropriate attitude is expected from
the Turkish state.
</P>
<P>
The PKK had announced earlier this month that it would
transform itself from a guerrilla group into a political
organization and promised a unilateral cease-fire and troops
withdrawal from Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Imprisoned PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan ordered an end to the
armed struggle against the Turkish government and people after he
had been sentenced to death for treason.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish government has refused to negotiate with the
PKK for the 15-year-long war between the Turkish security
forces and the PKK rebels.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting since 1984 a war for an
independent Kurdish state in southeastern Turkey, which has
claimed at least 37,000 lives in the conflicts.

<HEADLINE> EU to Probe Animal Feeds in Germany, Netherlands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission said
Wednesday that it was to probe into the possible use of sewage
sludge in animal feed production in Germany and the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
The commission, the executive body of the 15-nation European
Union, wrote to the German and Dutch authorities, asking for
information on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Thierry Daman, spokesman of the commission, said that field
inspections are possible for the two countries after the
commission gets official replies from the countries in question.
</P>
<P>
The standing veterinary committee of the commission has
conducted a field inspection in France, where the practice of
using sewage sludge in the production of animal feeds has caused
strong reaction from the media.
</P>
<P>
The commission said that initial results from the field
inspection showed there is the need for a plan of action on animal
feed but gave no further details.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that a general letter had been sent out to
all EU member states asking for information on the situation
regarding animal feeds.
</P>
<P>
The European Union has started a wide-ranging review of the
union's animal feed regulations in the wake of the dioxin-in-food
crisis in Belgium.

<HEADLINE> UK Public Spending Lowest For 40 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Public spending in Britain under
the present Labor government is heading for the lowest total in 40
years, according to a new analysis released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The analysis was carried out for the Guardian by Tony Travers,
a specialist at the London School of Economics. He says Labor is
on track to spend less than 40 percent of the gross domestic
product over the four years from 1997 to 2001.
</P>
<P>
That figure, an average based on current spending plans,
compares to 43 percent of GDP under Mrs. Thacher's administration,
and 45.4 percent under the previous Labor government of James
Callaghan and Harold Wilson.
</P>
<P>
City economists believe that the prudence will please the City,
which has been impressed by Labor's economic performance. But it
could spur calls at the Labor Party for the poor, and more
investment in public services.
</P>
<P>
The analysis indicates that the cumulative 40bn pounds extra
promised by Labor for health and education over the next three
years will make little impact on the public spending record.
</P>
<P>
The economists say the government is on track for a substantial
public sector surplus this year despite the weak economy and may
begin to pay down the public debt.
</P>
<P>
Part of the reason is that indirect taxes have continued to
rise, they add.
</P>
<P>
The figures have also been helped by a fall in social security
spending with record numbers of people in work.

<HEADLINE> Record Imports In UK Widen Trade Gap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 25 (Xinhua) -- A record demand for imported
goods and services sent Britain's trading deficit soaring to 1.5bn
pounds in June, its highest this year.
</P>
<P>
Imports of goods and services jumped by 7 percent to 20.1bn
pounds, the largest monthly total ever recorded, according to the
latest figures by the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
</P>
<P>
A recovery in domestic demand, stimulated by recent cuts in
interest rates and improved consumer confidence, has sucked in
bigger volumes of imports.
</P>
<P>
However, the pound's strength has also contributed to the
deteriorating trade position by making foreign products cheap.
</P>
<P>
The influx of competitively priced goods to Britain could limit
the ability of domestic producers to raise output.
</P>
<P>
The ONS expects the trend to worsen as the UK's economy
accelerates during the remainder of the year, sucking in more
goods from overseas.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Starts Open Debate on Protection of  Conflict-Affected Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
began an open debate Wednesday to examine ways and means of
enhancing the protection of children in armed conflict, and to
raise the worldwide awareness to the plight of children in the
plight.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of all Security Council members, including
China, and 32 non-member countries have inscribed to speak at the
debate, U.N. officials said. The Security Council is scheduled to
vote on a draft resolution at the end of the debate.
</P>
<P>
Olara Otunnu, U.N. special representative for children and
armed conflict, underlined the importance of the debate by saying,
"Children represent hope and future in every society. Destroying
children, you destroy the society."
</P>
<P>
Otunnu told a news briefing Tuesday that he is "very confident"
that the Security Council will adopt a draft resolution, which he
pushed very hard to include his proposals since last year.
</P>
<P>
If adopted, the proposed resolution would be the first in the
Security Council's history to focus exclusively on children and
armed conflict, he said.
</P>
<P>
"It would constitute a major breakthrough in the efforts by the
international community to protect children caught in the horror
of war," he said.
</P>
<P>
In the course of a single decade, from the mid-1980s to the
mid-1990s. Two million children were killed, 1 million orphaned, 6
million seriously injured or permanently disabled, 12 million made
homeless and 10 million left with serious psychological trauma.
</P>
<P>
In 1998 alone, which saw 27 major armed conflicts in 26
locations throughout the world, half of the ongoing major
conflicts incurred at least 1,000 deaths during the year.
</P>
<P>
More than 300,000 children under 18 years of age are known to
be currently fighting in armed conflicts around the world. In most
of these conflicts, children below 15, and even as young as seven
or eight years of age, have been reported to be taking an active
part.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Taliban Alliance Not Responsible for Bomb Blast: Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Afghanistan's anti-Taliban
alliance said Wednesday that it was not responsible for any
assassination attempt on the life of the Taliban's supreme leader
Mulla Omar.
</P>
<P>
A report from Kabul quoted opposition alliance spokesman Sayed
Anwari as saying that the massive bomb explosion Tuesday night
near Omar's house in Kandahar, the Taliban's headquarters, was the
result of frustrated locals venting their anger at the militia.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot take responsibility for this act. We have not done
it. This is the reaction of the people of Kandahar after Pakistani
religious scholars announced a Jehad (holy war) against Afghan
people," he said.
</P>
<P>
A truck loaded with explosive materials exploded Tuesday night
near the residence of Omar. At least 10 people including six
Taliban soldiers and four passers-by were killed in the powerful
blast, a report by the Afghan Islamic Press said earlier in the
day.
</P>
<P>
The explosion, shortly after 10 p.m. local time Tuesday night
(16:30 GMT), shattered windows and doors and sent frightened
residents scurrying for cover.
</P>
<P>
The truck with bomb was parked just three houses away from
Omar's home, and it went off when people tried to remove it, a
report from Kabul quoted Taliban spokesman Abdul Muttamin as
saying in Kandahar.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that Omar was not at home at the time of
explosion. The extent of damage was not clear.
</P>
<P>
So far, no one has taken responsibility for the explosion. And
the Taliban has not accused any body or any country, saying that
an investigation was under way.
</P>
<P>
Taliban officials said that first they want to know how this
truck loaded with explosive materials had got near Omar's
residence, and who was the driver.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, August 25 (Xinhua) -- United States Agency for
International Development (USAID) has granted two million dollar
in support of an employment and income development project in
northern Uganda.
</P>
<P>
The signing ceremony took place here Wednesday afternoon, press
release from the U.S. Information Service said.
</P>
<P>
The project will be a combination of an emergency relief
activity and a development activity. Rehabilitation of community
roads using local labor will infuse immediate cash into local
economies.
</P>
<P>
Income generation training, and savings and credit programs for
all members of surrounding communities will allow people to
select, manage and plan activities leading to self-employment.
</P>
<P>
Funding for the project came from USAID's Greater Horn of
Africa Initiative as a result of President Bill Clinton's visit to
Uganda in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Care, a non-governmental organization, brings its long
experience in working in areas of northern Uganda and in other
areas of the world to the project. The project will build upon the
initiative of districts of Kitgum and Gulu to establish a
foundation for social and economic recovery of the northern part
of the country.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Commission to Fix Date for Hearing of MP Seats Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladesh Election Commission
(EC) will soon decide a date for hearing the allegations of
floor-crossing of two opposition members of parliament, the BSS
news agency reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The EC will fix the date on August 30.
</P>
<P>
The decision has been communicated to the lawyers of both the
parties of the dispute, and deputy leader of the opposition A.Q.M.
Badruddoza Chowdhury, opposition chief whip Khandker Delwar
Hossain, and the two opposition MPs -- State Minister for Water
Resources Dr. Alauddin Ahmed and Deputy Minister for Industries
Hasibur Rahman Swapan, EC Additional Secretary Aziz Ahmed was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Alauddin Ahmed and Hasibur Rahman, both lawmakers of the
opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) who joined the
government early last year, on Tuesday submitted letters
clarifying their positions on the allegation of their
floor-crossing following notices served to them by the EC.
</P>
<P>
Khandker Delwar Hossain and Badruddoza Chowdhury submitted a
writ petition to the High Court last year saying that the two BNP
lawmakers had lost their seats in parliament after joining the
government.
</P>
<P>
The court directed the parliament speaker late last month to
refer the dispute to the EC.

<HEADLINE> Unemployment in S. Africa Expected to Grow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 25 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's jobless rate
might climb to 41.7 percent by the year 2003 from 38 percent at
present, a Human Sciences Research Council (HSRC) study revealed
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"It is not a rosy picture at all," said Andrew Whiteford,
co-author of the study. "Our figures suggest a rapid rise in
unemployment."
</P>
<P>
Whiteford said his research suggested that the unemployment
rate would rise to 41.7 percent by 2003.
</P>
<P>
Only about 45,000 new formal sector jobs would become available
over the period 1998 to 2003 despite a projected annual economic
growth rate of 2.7 percent, according to the study.
</P>
<P>
Whiteford said a total of 199,000 new jobs would be created in
the construction, trade, finance and services sectors. However,
154,000 jobs would be shed in the mining, manufacturing,
electricity and government sectors.
</P>
<P>
Most job losses, a total of 74,000, were predicted in central,
provincial and local government, followed by manufacturing with
45,000 and mining with 30,000.
</P>
<P>
"Whereas total employment in the private sector is expected to
grow by almost three percent between 1998 and 2003, employment in
the government sector is expected to decline by five percent," the
HSRC report states.
</P>
<P>
The trade, catering and accommodation sector was expected to
account for most new jobs, about 109,000, largely as a result of
growing tourism in the country.
</P>
<P>
The HSRC study suggested rapid growth in the demand for
professionals such as computer experts and chartered accountants,
with a projected growth rate of 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
The number of jobs for managers and artisans was expected to
increase by between four and six percent.
</P>
<P>
"Professionals show the largest gain, from 16 percent of total
employment in 1998 to 18 percent in 2003," the HSRC said.
"Semi-skilled or unskilled occupations, on the other hand, are
expected to show the largest decline, from 35 percent to 33
percent over this period."
</P>
<P>
About 71,000 semi-skilled or unskilled jobs were expected to be
lost by 2003.
</P>
<P>
The study also revealed a shortage of versatile and experienced
managers and professionals in the formal labor market.
</P>
<P>
Of the 273 organizations questioned, 76 percent said they did
not have enough adequately skilled staff. More than half said they
did not have enough professionals.
</P>
<P>
"It is clear that the South African labor market is
specifically affected by the worldwide demand for IT (information
technology) skills," the HSRC said.

<HEADLINE> Peace in Congo to Bring Zambia Larger Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The signing of the cease-fire
agreement to end a year-long conflict in the Democratic Republic
of Congo (DRC) is expected to significantly increase Zambia's
exports prospects to that country.
</P>
<P>
According to a release from the Export Board of Zambia (EBZ) on
 Wednesday, the DRC has continued to be one of Zambia's largest
market in the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa
(COMESA) accounting for over 33 percent of the total foreign
exchange earnings from the region.
</P>
<P>
It says the DRC market poses tremendous challenges for the
business community, including Zambia, to expand their exports.
</P>
<P>
Zambia's major non-traditional exports to the DRC comprise
cement, agricultural products, electricity, petroleum products and
building materials.
</P>
<P>
The release urged the business community to fully exploit the
existing potential in the DRC and penetrate the market as quickly
as possible, especially after the end of the conflict.
</P>
<P>
It is in this light that a great need arises for the business
community in Zambia to fully exploit the DRC market by going flat
out to penetrate and expand their share of that market since there
is tremendous potential for increased growth, it said.
</P>
<P>
Zambian government has also been urged to create a conducive
environment for the Zambian exporter to the DRC whose market is
expected to remain dependent on imports for some years when peace
returns to that country.
</P>
<P>
The publication said Zambia's proximity and cultural
similarities with the DRC gives the local business community an
added advantage in increasing its share of the market.
</P>
<P>
According to an earlier report Congolese rebel leaders said
Tuesday they had agreed to sign a peace deal aimed at ending the
conflict in that country.
</P>
<P>
Six African countries involved in the conflict have signed a
cease-fire agreement in Lusaka last month but the rebels at first
refused to sign because they could not agree on which of two rival
factions led their movement.

LONDON, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Up to 1 million people in
Britain's 59 million-strong population are "workaholics" who are
working an average of 60 hours a week, but their obsession with
their jobs often hits both their productivity and their personal
lives, according to a survey published Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
But while around one third of people believe working longer
hours makes them more productive, another third found they had to
redo work because their companies were inefficient
</P>
<P>
Eight hundred and twenty-three of the 7,987 people interviewed
said they worked longer than 48 hours a week, 73 percent of whom
admitted to making errors when tired, the Institute of Personnel
and Development survey found.
</P>
<P>
One in three people working more than 48 hours a week claimed
to be addicted to their job. A similar proportion said they spent
a lot of time solving problems caused by inefficiency in their
organization.
</P>
<P>
Among those surveyed, one in three people working long hours
conceded that relationship with a spouse or partner had been
strained while one in eight said they had broken up with their
partner because of the amount of time they spent at work.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Supports Kuwait Against Foreign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Turkish Foreign
Minister Ismail Cem asserted here Wednesday his country's firm
support for Kuwait against any foreign threat that will jeopardize
its sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Kuwait News Agency before concluding his
two-day visit, Cem said that Turkey opposes any Iraqi threat
against Kuwait or Iraq's other neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
He urged Iraq to fully comply with all U.N. resolutions related
to its invasion of Kuwait in 1990, which sparked the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
Cem also extended Turkey's full support to Kuwait in its
efforts to secure a quick release of over 600 Kuwaiti and third
country nationals allegedly still held in Iraqi jails.
</P>
<P>
"The humanitarian issue should end," he said.
</P>
<P>
Cem arrived here Tuesday night for his first visit to the Gulf
emirate since he assumed office in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish foreign minister met earlier Wednesday with
Kuwaiti Emir Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah and conveyed a message from
Turkish President Suleyman Demirel.
</P>
<P>
He also held talks with first Deputy Prime Minister and
Foreign Minister Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah, and Deputy Prime
Minister and Defense Minister Sheikh Salem Sabah Al-Salem Al-Sabah.
</P>
<P>
Cem termed those talks positive and constructive, which
focused on ways of promoting bilateral political, economic and
military cooperation.
</P>
<P>
On Kuwait's relief supplies to Turkey's earthquake-affected
people, the Turkish top diplomat expressed gratitude to Kuwait
for its generous humanitarian aid to Ankara.
</P>
<P>
Since a killer earthquake shook northwestern Turkey on August
17, which has left at least 18,000 dead, Kuwait has sent six
batches of relief materials and rescue teams to the quake-hit
areas.

MOSCOW, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Russian Finance Minister Mikhail
Kasyanov Denied on Wednesday that the government is linked to an
alleged money laundering scheme under investigation at the Bank of
New York in the United States.
</P>
<P>
"I have no information indicating that Russia has anything to
do with this problem, so there is no need for the government to
interfere in this situation," Kasyanov said.
</P>
<P>
The denial came after a report last week by The New York Times
that U.S. authorities were investigating the bank, where 4.2
billion U.S. dollars passed through a single account in more than
10,000 transactions between October and March.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 25 (Xinhua) - European stock markets closed
higher Wednesday, on the back of a US rate decision and a surge in
leading European telecom stocks.
</P>
<P>
While the US Dow Jones Industrial Average remained nervous
after the Federal Reserve's quarter point rates hike, London
continued to bask in the relief the rise had not been higher.
</P>
<P>
The FTSE 100 jumped 54.4 points, or 0.86 percent, to 6369.5
with telecoms - which account for 14.6 percent of the blue chip
index's total weighting - contributing about 34 points.
</P>
<P>
BT led the FTSE 100 charge, gaining 5.80 percent to 1007 pence,
while Vodafone AirTouch jumped 2.8 percent to 1233 pence and Golt
soared 5.6 percent to 1319 pence.
</P>
<P>
Banks, which are traditionally extra-sensitive to any changes
in monetary policy, advanced confidently as the rate climate
softened in the wake of the Fed's quarter-point increase.
</P>
<P>
Bank of Scotland shot up 5.36 percent after announcing plans to
launch mortgage products in Ireland, while Royal Bank of Scotland
advanced 5.16 percent.
</P>
<P>
Frankfurt's electronic Xetra Dax climbed 1.43 percent to
5400.32.
</P>
<P>
It was driven by a surge in Deutsche Telekom, which vaulted
more than 6.5 percent in first-half results and forecast a
better-than-expected outlook for the remainder of the year.
</P>
<P>
The CAC 40 in Paris ended up 1.96 percent at 4629.23 - above a
sensitive 4600 barrier - as cash poured into technology, cyclical

TIRANA, August 25 (Xinhua) -- "Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA)"
leader Hashim Thaci Wednesday rejected a proposal by Kosovo Serbs
demanding for enclaves in Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> Britain's Lords Baffled by Right to Vote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Britain's hereditary peers who
have shunned democracy for generations were puzzled at being given
only 75 words why they should remain in the House of Lords.
</P>
<P>
The hereditary peers, who make up most of the unelected House
of Lords, are expected to take part in the elections which will
trim away 90 percent of the army of aristocrats in parliament's
upper chamber.
</P>
<P>
The elections, due to be held in late October, will decide the
select few who will cling on to their dynastic right -- at least
for now, the Times newspaper said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
And to ensure the blue-blooded scramble for survival is a
dignified one, a proposed code of conduct has been drawn up by the
parliament officials -- after consulting the Electoral Reform
Society -- to guide peers unused to standing for elections.
</P>
<P>
Instead of long-winded manifestos, candidates will be granted
just 75 words to justify holding on to parliamentary seats, some
of which have passed from father to son since the 13th century.
</P>
<P>
Under the code of conduct, candidates may not offer
hospitality, entertainment or financial inducements to electors
intended to influence their votes or likely to have that effect.
</P>
<P>
They are also forbidden from circulating election material
themselves -- their postage-stamp manifestos will be placed in the
House of Lords library for reflective perusal by voters.
</P>
<P>
The planned elections are part of wider reforms of the House of
Lords being pushed by Prime Minister Tony Blair, whose Labour
government has argued for the expulsion of all hereditary
aristocrats, most of them Conservatives.
</P>
<P>
It accepted a compromise allowing 92 hereditary peers, or 10
percent of the current number, to stay on in a transition period
alongside life peers, who are appointed by the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
But the government's proposed bill still faces a final reading
in the House of Lords, where it has already sparked considerable
opposition.

NAIROBI, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi
has banned flights between Kenya and Somalia, the presidential
press service announced here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The president said in a speech that the ban applied to "all air
flights" including humanitarian aid flights into Somalia.
</P>
<P>
Last Sunday, Moi announced that Kenya closed its entire common
border with Somalia with immediate effect in a bid to curb
smuggling and the influx of illegal arms and contraband goods into
Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The flight ban will affect aid work, particularly the movement
of aid workers through the U.N. Common Air Service for Somalia,
said a spokeswoman for the U.N. World Food Program.

<HEADLINE> Sampras, Hingis Hot-Favorites to Win U.S. Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sampras, the top seed, defeated the 19-year-old Safin in
straight sets in the fourth round at last year's U.S. Open. The
four-time champion could face countryman Jan-Michael Gambill in
the third round.
</P>
<P>
Also in Sampras' eighth of the draw is two-time finalist Jim
Courier of the United States, tricky Frenchman Fabrice Santoro,
and No. 16 Nicolas Lapentti of Ecuador. Lapentti won the RCA
Championships at Indianapolis last week.
</P>
<P>
Sampras missed the early part of the year due to mental and
physical exhaustion and lost his No.1 ranking, but has returned
with a vengeance to reclaim the top spot in men's tennis.
</P>
<P>
After his second-round loss at the French Open, Sampras won 24
consecutive matches and four straight tournaments, including his
sixth Wimbledon title, tying former Australian star Roy Emerson's
all-time record for most Grand Slam titles.
</P>
<P>
However, sampras may not be 100 percent after suffering a
strained hip flexor last week in Indiana. He could meet seventh
seed Todd Martin of the United States or No. 9 Greg Rusedski of
Britain.
</P>
<P>
On the women's side, top seed Martin Hingis of Switzerland, the
1997 champion and last year's runner-up, will take on Kveta
Hrdlickova of the Czech Republic in the first round.
</P>
<P>
However she is not expected to face a tough opponent until the
fourth round, where she could play 1994 winner and No. 10 Arantxa
Sanchez Vicario, who will encounter Jelena Dokic in the first
round. The Australian teenager reached the Wimbledon quarterfinals
in July.
</P>
<P>
Hingis captured her third consecutive Australian Open title in
January but suffered back-to-back defeat at the French Open final
and the first round at Wimbledon and took a temporary break from
the game.
</P>
<P>
Hingis has been impressive in her return, winning two titles
and reaching the semifinal in another, and will seek her sixth
Grand Slam singles title.
</P>
<P>
Second seed and defending champion Lindsay Davenport will face
double partner and fellow American Corina Morariu.
</P>
<P>
Davenport did not drop a single set at last year's Open and
became the first American-born woman since Chris Evert to win the
event.
</P>
<P>
She beat the now-retired Steffi Graf at Wimbledon to capture
her second Grand Slam title and has won four titles overall in
1999.
</P>
<P>
No. 9 Julie Halard-Decugis of France is in Davenport's eighth
of the draw. Davenport could face another seeded player from
France in the quarterfinals, either No. 5 Mary Pierce or No. 4
Sandrine Testud.
</P>
<P>
Third seed Venus Williams, the 1997 finalist, will be happy to
see her younger sister, No. 7 Serena, on the opposite side of the
draw. Venus Williams, in the top half with Hingis, has four
qualifiers in her section but also 13th seed Dominique Van Roost
of Belgium,American Mary Joe Fernanez, and Barbara Schwartz of
Austria.
</P>
<P>
A possible quarterfinal opponent for Venus Williams could be No.
6 Amanda Coetzer of South Africa, who must get past first-round
foe and 1997 semifinalist Irina Spirlea of Romania.
</P>
<P>
Two-time champion Monica Seles, in Serena Williams' quarter of
the draw, will meet Barbara Rittner of Germany in the first round
and should have no trouble reaching the fourth round, where she
could face 11th seed Nathalie Tauziat of France.
</P>
<P>
Tauziat will start off against Wimbledon semifinalist Alexandra
Stevenson of the United States.
</P>
<P>
Third seed Patrick Rafter of Australia was placed in Sampras'
half of the draw and will battle 1993 runner-up Cedric Pioline in
the first round.
</P>
<P>
Rafter will look to become the first male to win three straight
U.S. Opens since Ivan Lendl in 1985-87. But like Sampras, Rafter
arrives in New York ailing. He aggravated a right shoulder injury
during his match with Sampras two weeks ago and played two matches
before pulling out in Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
Rafter has to counquer Australian Open finalist Thomas Enqvist
of Sweden in the first-round before facing No. 14 Tommy Haas of
Germany. Fifth seed Gustavo Kuerten of Brazil, who will play
Bohdan Ulihrach of the Czech Republic in the opening round, and No.
11 Mark Philippoussis of Australia lurk as possible
quarterfinalists.
</P>
<P>
In the bottom half of the draw, French Open champion Andre
Agassi of the United States will square off against Sweden's
Nicklas Kulti in the first round, and could face a qualifier in
the second. No. 15 Nicolas Kiefer of Germany is the other seed in
Agassi's section.
</P>
<P>
Eighth seed Carlos Moya of Spain or No. 10 Marcelo Rios of
Chile are possible quarterfinal matcheups for Agassi. Moya will
need to get past French Open semifinalist Dominik Hrbaty of
Slovakia while Rios must advance past Martin Damm of the Czech
Republic.
</P>
<P>
Australian Open winner and fourth seed Yevgeny Kafelnikov of
Russia has a few tests in his quarter of the draw. Thomas
Johansson of Sweden, who has beaten the Russian three straight
times, could be a second-round opponent. Sixth seed Tim Henman of
Britain, No. 12 Richard Krajicek of the Netherlands, and No. 13
Alex Corretja of Spain are also in Kafelnikov's group.

WASHINGTON, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The United States on
Wednesday denied involvement in a bombing in Afghanistan that
killed at least 10 people near the residence of the supreme leader
of the country's Taliban movement.
</P>
<P>
"We're aware of the explosion but we're not aware of the
origins of that explosion beyond knowing that it was no something
we were involved in," White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Foley said the United States
government contacted the Taliban office in New York and in
Kandahar to disown any connection with the bomb.
</P>
<P>
He said the decision to contact the Taliban was taken in
response to Afghan press reports of a U.S. connection.
</P>
<P>
Afghanistan's Taliban said on Wednesday that supreme leader
Mullah Mohammad Omar escaped unhurt when a "sabotage" bomb
exploded near his residence in the Taliban's spiritual capital of
Kandahar.

<HEADLINE> East Timor Ballot to Proceed on Schedule </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The ballot on East
Timor's future will proceed on schedule next Monday, U.N. sources
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The last day of campaigning is Friday and the two-day weekend
on August 28 and 29 is the cool-off period, before the ballot day
when over 450,000 registered East Timor voters choose special
autonomy within Indonesia or independence, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Against the backdrop of reported escalating violence and
intimidation, the United Nations Mission in East Timor (UNAMET)
has been given assurances that the Indonesian police will increase
their presence to ensure the free movement of voters on the
polling day, a U.N. spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"Today, a large pro-independence rally took place in Dili and
as far as we are aware there were no incidents," spokesman Manoel
de Almeida e Silva said.
</P>
<P>
A new movement of internally displaced persons, estimated at
several thousand, has taken place which has created difficulties
in voting on August 30, he said.
</P>
<P>
UNAMET and the Indonesian police are discussing additional
security measures in this respect, he added.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic activities are intensified with the last round of
senior officials' meeting between Indonesia and Portugal to be
held in Lisbon on Thursday. It will focus on the phase III and the
most recent developments on the ground, the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
Phase I is the ballot process, followed by phase II as a
transitional period and the phase III as a period of the
implementation of the referendum outcome.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia and Portugal reached agreement on May 5 to determine
the status of East Timor through referendum, or popular
consultation.
</P>
<P>
Under the pact, if autonomy is chosen by the majority of
people, Portugal will help remove East Timor from the list of
non-self-governing territories of the U.N. General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
If the result is the opposite, Indonesia will take
constitutional steps to terminate its links with East Timor,
letting it go independent with U.N. arrangements.
</P>
<P>
The accord gave the United Nations the mandate to organize and
conduct the ballot, holding Indonesia responsible for an secure
environment for the poll.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia occupied East Timor, former Portuguese colony in 1975
and annexed it the following year. Since then the U.N. has been
trying to resolve the issue of the territory's status.

"Children are innocent and especially vulnerable," he said.
"They bear no responsibility for conflict, yet suffer
disproportionately from its excess."
</P>
<P>
Otunnu made the statement at an open debate at the U.N.
Security Council to seek a U.N. resolution that would be binding
on all Member States in the protection of children in armed
conflict. If adopted, it would be the first U.N. resolution which
devoted its attention to this issue.

"Children neither start wars not perpetuate them. They should
not pay the price for adults' war," he said. "This is one instance

</P>
<P>
About 300,000 children, including girls, under 18 serve as
regular soldiers, guerrilla fighters, porters, cooks, sex slaves,
and suicide commandos in 30 nations marked by conflict. Most of
these children are under 15 and some are as young as seven.
</P>
<P>
From the mid-80s to the mid-90s, 2 million children were
killed, 1 million orphaned, 6 million seriously injured or
permanently disabled, 12 million made homeless and 10 million left
with serious psychological trauma.

TOKYO, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Keizo

Minister Jia Chunwang here Thursday, said he hopes that Japan and
China would cooperate in dealing with international crime groups.
</P>
<P>
"I'm happy that exchanges between the two countries have gained

</P>
<P>
Obuchi said that enhancing cooperation in public security and
police is one important area of agreement between the two

<HEADLINE> U.S. Economic Growth Slows to 1.8 Percent in 2nd Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. economy increased at
a slower annual rate of 1.8 percent in the second quarter because
of a swelled trade deficit, the Commerce Department reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The increase in the gross domestic product, the total output of
goods and services, from April through June was slower than the
2.3 percent the department had estimated one month ago.
</P>
<P>
The deceleration in real GDP in the second quarter primarily
reflected a deceleration in personal consumption expenditures and
a downturn in government spending that more than offset an upturn
in exports, the GDP report said.
</P>
<P>
The inflation-sensitive bond market showed little reaction to
the report, as yields on 30-year Treasurys held steady at 5.86
percent Thursday morning, up from late Wednesday's 5.85 percent.
</P>
<P>
Economists said that although the U.S. economy has slowed in
recent months, it is still expected to grow almost 4 percent this
year.
</P>
<P>
The revised report said economic growth was reduced by 1.34
percentage points by a second-quarter trade deficit that was 14.4
billion dollars worse than originally estimated.
</P>
<P>
The trade deficit in the second quarter swelled to 33.8 billion
dollars as a 14.4 percent jump in imports overwhelmed a 4.3
percent rise in exports.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the report said the profits of U.S. companies
decreased at an annual rate of 9.2 billion dollars in the second
quarter, the biggest drop since the end of 1997. In the first
quarter of the year, profits rose at a 47.1 billion dollar rate.
</P>
<P>
In addition to facing stiff price competition from imports,
U.S. companies are being pinched by increasing labor costs
resulting from the lowest unemployment rates in three decades.
</P>
<P>
Many economists had expected the ballooning trade deficit to
cool economic growth and calm fears that the economy could
overheat.
</P>
<P>
The report said consumer spending, which accounts for
two-thirds of total economic activity, increased at an annual rate
of 4.6 percent in the second quarter. That was brisker than
estimated one month ago but still slower than the torrid 6.7
percent pace of spending in the January-March quarter.
</P>
<P>
Consumers continue to spend even more than they earn, pulling
the nation's personal savings rate to a record low of negative 1.3
percent in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
However, the department did not revise an inflation gauge tied
to second-quarter GDP, which rose 2.1 percent. In the first
quarter of this year, that inflation measure rose 1.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Business investment, spending on new equipment and plants, rose
at an annual rate of 11.2 percent in the second quarter, an even
stronger showing than the government first estimated.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the report showed that spending for new homes and
apartments increased at a 7.7 percent rate, better than the 5.1
percent rate originally estimated, but still slower than the first
quarter of 1999. Analysts believe the housing market will cool in
the coming months because of rising mortgage rates.
</P>
<P>
All the changes show the economy growing at an annual rate of
34.7 billion dollars in the second quarter of the year, pushing
the country's total output of goods and services to 7.8 trillion
dollars, after adjusting for inflation.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Government Meeting On State-Own Enterprise Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Economic issues, especially the
development state-owned enterprises, will become the major topics
of a meeting of the Standing Committee of the Ninth National
Committee of Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (
CPPCC) scheduled for next month.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made at today's CPPCC chairpersons meeting
presided over by Chairman Li Ruihuan.
</P>
<P>
Li said that the upcoming meeting will focus on reforms and
development of the country's state-owned enterprises, which are
important for the healthy operation of the economy and its long-
term prospects.
</P>
<P>
Li, who is also member of the Standing Committee of the
Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee,
called on specialists from the CPPCC, a national advisory body, to
contribute to the reforms.
</P>
<P>
He said that there has been some success in dealing with the
issue of Falun Gong and some problems have been exposed. He
emphasized that Party building needs to be increased and
ideological and political work improved because it was tragic for
some individual Party members, who said they believed in Marxism,
to believe in superstitions and ghosts.
</P>
<P>
Li said that the CPPCC celebrations for the 50th anniversary of
New China should not be too extravagant.

<HEADLINE> Innovation, Technology Important Economic Drivers: Tung </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The Chief Executive of the
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, Tung Chee Hwa, said
Thursday that Hong Kong will actively promote the development of
innovation and technology.
</P>
<P>
These are crucial drivers of economic growth, as we prepare
ourselves for economic recovery, the chief executive said.
</P>
<P>
Tung has started meeting legislators from Thursday until next
Wednesday to exchange views with them on matters of public concern.
</P>
<P>
The chief executive said Hong Kong's economy was steadily
emerging from the effects of the Asian financial turmoil.
</P>
<P>
"Innovation and technology are the principal means to improve
efficiency and productivity, add value and enhance overall
competitiveness," he said.
</P>
<P>
The government will take active steps to create a favorable
environment to facilitate the development of innovation and
technology, he said.
</P>
<P>
On small and medium enterprises (SMEs), the chief executive
said that SMEs are important pillars of HK economy.
</P>
<P>
The HK government launched the Special Finance Scheme for Small
and Medium Enterprises last year with the aim of helping SMEs to
cope with the liquidity crunch problem. So far, about 4,950
applications have been approved.
</P>
<P>
The government will monitor the scheme closely and conduct
reviews as necessary, Tung said.
</P>
<P>
Regarding environmental protection, Tung said that much had
already been done in improving the quality of the air and water as
well as waste treatment and disposal. But much more remained to be
done, he said.
</P>
<P>
"I hope all of you will support measures to improve the
environment in order to provide a world-class quality of life for
people of Hong Kong and people who will come to work and live in
Hong Kong, he said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese, Kyrgyzstan Presidents Sign Supplementary Border Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BISHKEK, Kyrgyzstan, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President
Jiang Zemin and his Kyrgyzstan counterpart Askar Akayev met here
Thursday on bilateral relations and signed a supplementary border
agreement.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Akayev said he enjoyed the past few days he
shared with President Jiang, during which they not only
participated in the five-nation summit, but also held bilateral
talks.
</P>
<P>
"Today is a historic day," said Akayev, "as we are completing
border negotiations and signing a bilateral supplementary border
agreement. It tallies with the interests of both countries and
peoples. The Kyrgyz people are very pleased to have the sensitive
and complicated problem settled in the 20th century."
</P>
<P>
Praising highly Kyrgyz-Chinese relations, the host said the two
countries have carried out good cooperation in all fields. The
Kyrgyz people believe that developing good-neighborly relations
with China unswervingly is the main factor for their country to
maintain a sustainable development, and President Jiang's visit
would inject new vigor into the bilateral economic and trade
cooperation, he added.
</P>
<P>
Akayev reaffirmed his country's one-China policy, adding that
Kyrgyzstan would stick to its stand of opposing separatism,
religious extremism and terrorism, and would not allow any force
to make use of its soil to conduct activities against China.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, on his part, said that "China and Kyrgyzstan are good
neighbors, which enjoy favorable conditions for conducting mutual
exchanges. And we highly appreciate the great importance your
excellency has all along attached to Chinese-Kyrgyz relations."
</P>
<P>
"The cooperation in all fields has achieved a good start and is
further developing. The bilateral trade climbed 85 percent last
year, reaching 200 million U.S. dollars, which shows that there
still exists great potential in our cooperation. We are confident
of the bright prospects of Chinese-Kyrgyz relations," said Jiang.
</P>
<P>
"We are signing the China-Kyrgystan Supplementary Border
Agreement today, which marks the complete settlement of the
alignment of the over 1,000-kilometer border line between the two
countries," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the smooth settlement of the border issue is a
concrete embodiment of the mutual trust and mutual friendship
between the two countries. He appreciated President Akayev's
efforts to push for a comprehensive settlement of the border issue
and believed that the border will become a link of friendship
between the peoples of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
On the just-concluded five-nation summit, Jiang said, "We five
heads of state held talks yesterday and conducted an in-depth
exchange of views on regional security. We hold that it is
extremely important for a country or region to maintain a stable
internal and external environment.
</P>
<P>
"We must be on a high state of alert against and join hands to
combat those factors that are potentially perilous to stability,
such as extremist religious forces, national separatist forces, as
well as transnational crime such as drug trafficking and arms
smuggling."
</P>
<P>
Elaborating his views on the current international situation,
Jiang said all countries should adhere to the principles of
respecting each other's sovereignty and territorial integrity, non-
interference in each other's internal affairs, and resolving
international disputes through peaceful means, and work toward
building a just and rational international political and economic
order.
</P>
<P>
Akayev echoed Jiang's views and said that they have been fully
reflected in the statement made by the five heads of state in
Bishkek. He promised that Kyrgyzstan will firmly support China's
endeavors to work toward a just and rational international
political and economic order.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Jiang and Akayev inked the China-Kyrgystan
Supplementary Border Agreement.

<HEADLINE> State of Emergency Declared in Southern Kyrgyzstan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 26 (Xinhua) -- A state of emergency was declared
Thursday in the Batken district in southern Kyrgyzstan to counter
Tajik militants that had seized four villages in the district, the
Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Reservists are being mobilized in the region to fight the
militants that have taken hostage four Japanese geologists and the
commander of the Kyrgyz Interior Troops, Interfax said, quoting
the press service of the Kyrgyz Defense Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Thursday, an air strike was delivered on the militants'
bases in the Chon-Alai district of the Osh region bordering on
Tajikistan. A group of some 50 militants were believed to be
located there.
</P>
<P>
Interfax said the neighboring republics may have assisted
Kyrgyzstan in launching the air strikes.
</P>
<P>
By agreement between the Kyrgyz, Uzbek and Kazakh authorities,
Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan may assist Bishkek in cases of emergency.

<HEADLINE> Kremlin: Yeltsins Have No Foreign Bank Accounts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The Kremlin said Thursday that
President Boris Yeltsin, his wife and children have never opened
accounts in foreign banks, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The Yeltsin family has been duly declaring its incomes and
such declarations have been published several times, the
presidential press service said.
</P>
<P>
The denial came after the U.S.A. Today newspaper reported
Thursday that Russian organized crime figures laundered at least
15 billion U.S. dollars through two New York banks at the
direction of President Boris Yeltsin's government.
</P>
<P>
The money might include 10 billion dollars in International
Monetary Fund (IMF) loans, the paper said, citing senior U.S.,
British and Russian law enforcement officials.
</P>
<P>
The paper claimed that at least five current or former members
of Yeltsin's government, all of whom had access to the IMF money,
are being investigated to determine their roles in laundering the
money. They are Yeltsin's daughter and adviser Tatyana Dyachenko,
Yeltsin's former chief of staff and finance minister Anatoly
Chubais, former deputy prime minister Oleg Soskovets, former
finance minister Alexander Livshits, and former deputy chairman of
the Russian federation Vladimir Potanin.
</P>
<P>
Chubais, now Chief Executive Officer of the Russian Unified
Energy Systems, also denied a report by the Italian Corriere della
Sera newspaper that he had an account at the Banco del Gottardo of
Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
"The newspaper report is a lie from beginning to end. Never
have I had bank accounts abroad -- either during the years in
government or the presidential administration or now," he said in
a statement.
</P>
<P>
Russian First Deputy Finance Minister Alexei Kudrin on
Thursday reiterated Moscow's denial that it had misused IMF money.
</P>
<P>
"This is an absolute lie, and the impression is that a
campaign has been launched for the purpose of undermining
relations between investors and Russia," he told a live program of
the Echo of Moscow radio.
</P>
<P>
He said the problem of a possible misuse of the IMF loans was
discussed by the IMF Board of Directors on July 28, and it was
decided that reports on the misuse of the IMF money were at
variance with the real situation.

<HEADLINE> Cambodia, U.N. Differ on Tribunal for Khmer Rouge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian National Assembly
President Prince Norodom Ranariddh said Thursday that differences
remain between a U.N. legal team and its Cambodian counterpart
over a mixed Khmer Rouge tribunal.
</P>
<P>
Prince Ranariddh quoted Ralph Zacklin, chief of the U.N. legal
team, as saying that "the United Nations and the Cambodian
government seemed to have different positions."
</P>
<P>
But with further discussions there would be a compromise or
some common ground, said Ranariddh.
</P>
<P>
Prince Ranariddh held a meeting with Ralph Zacklin and his team
Thursday afternoon. But neither of them has revealed the details
of their discussion as well as the differences.
</P>
<P>
But Ranariddh said that "the key to the question now is not who
will have a majority of judges but how to come to an international
standard."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. legal team arrived here Wednesday to discuss with the
Cambodian government establishing a mixed tribunal to try former
Khmer Rouge leaders who allegedly committed crimes of genocide and
crimes against humanity.
</P>
<P>
Before meeting with Prince Ranariddh, the five-member U.N. team
met with Cambodia's nine-member committee appointed by Prime
Minister Hun Sen and called on Foreign Minister Hor Nam Hong.
</P>
<P>
Hor stressed that "any trial of Khmer Rouge leaders should not
endanger Cambodia's still fragile peace and violate the country's
sovereignty."
</P>
<P>
The United Nations wants to have a majority of foreign judges
in a mixed tribunal and a free hand to control the trial, but the
proposed U.N. plan has been rejected by Hun Sen, who insists that
any trial of former Khmer Rouge leaders should be controlled by
Cambodian courts.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Legislators Say They Will Fight Judicial Corruption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Members of the Ninth National
People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee, at its eleventh
meeting, said they will use the Committee's supervisory function
to curb corruption among judges and law enforcement officers.
</P>
<P>
They discussed the NPC's role in handling judicial mistakes and
illegal activities in courts and procuratorates and suggest giving
the NPC and local legislators jurisdiction over major legal cases
that have been improperly handled.
</P>
<P>
Unfair rulings and the mishandling of cases have aroused a
large number of complaints across the country and have had a
negative effect in society, according to Hou Zongbin, the chairman
of the NPC's Civil and Legal Committee. Many committee members are
concerned about the illegal activities in lower courts and
procuratorates and say that tightening supervision of local judges
and procuratorates would greatly help maintaining judicial
fairness.
</P>
<P>
Some committee members also noted that the fight against
judicial corruption needs both an internal supervisory system
handled by judges and an outside one of legislators.
</P>
<P>
There must never be interference in the legitimate and
independent operations of the judiciary, they said.

<HEADLINE> China's NPC Chairman Meets With Norodom Sihanouk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Li Peng, chairman of the Chinese
National People's Congress Standing Committee, in a meeting here
this afternoon with Cambodia's King Norodom Sihanouk, expressed
pleasure over Sihanouk's good health.
</P>
<P>
Li told Sihanouk, who is about to return home after a two-month
medical check-up in China, that China appreciates how he has
devoted himself to Sino-Cambodian friendship.
</P>
<P>
Li said that the positive changes taking place in Cambodia can
not be separated from Sihanouk's leadership and unremitting
efforts and that he hopes that Cambodia will have more success in
maintaining political stability and developing the economy and
foreign exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Li also voiced his appreciation that Sihanouk and the Cambodian
government adhere to the "one-China" policy and support the cause
of China's peaceful reunification. Li especially expressed thanks
to Sihanouk for his solemn statement recently about the Taiwan
issue.
</P>
<P>
Sihanouk extended his gratitude for the care he received in
China and said that the Chinese government has sympathized with
and supported Cambodia's independence and national liberation, and
has played a positive role in every major phase of Cambodia's

<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian military troops has
stormed the Somali southern border region of Gedo in the past five
days.
</P>
<P>
The towns of Bulo Hawo, Dolow-Somalia and Luq, the former
Al-Itihad headquarters, were dead silent with no one coming out or
allowed getting in. All kinds of telecommunications were cut off.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that thousands of Ethiopian military forces
equipped with dozens of battle wagons and artillery guns dragged
on lorries had overtaken the above towns.
</P>
<P>
According to VHF radio reports in Garbaharrey and Bardera
towns, the Ethiopian forces have collected almost all VHF radios
and frozen all other telecommunications including public and
commercial transport within or outside the towns.
</P>
<P>
The reason for the new incursion is not known. However,
unconfirmed sources said armed confrontations between the
Ethiopian forces and rebel elements from the Oromo Liberation
Front fighting against the regime of Addis Ababa have spread
across the border into Somalia.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian forces searched all houses and every nook of the
towns confiscating all kinds of privately owned weapons and
ammunition, arresting and beating those suspected for owning
something not publicly known, witnesses reaching Garbaharrey town
said.
</P>
<P>
The chairman of the Somali National Front (SNF) faction,
General Omar Hajji Masalleh, has condemned the incursion and what
he called the gross human rights violations allegedly committed by
the Ethiopian forces in these towns.

<HEADLINE> Estrada Seeks Covenant With Congress on Charter Change </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada urged legislators Thursday to join him in a covenant
assuring the public that only economic reforms proposed to the
constitution will be discussed once they reach Congress.
</P>
<P>
The president also vowed to be at the forefront in blocking any
attempt to introduce political reforms to the 1987 constitution.
</P>
<P>
He told the Senate and the House of Representatives in separate
letters that "if Congress is convened into a constituent assembly,
we will only pursue amendments to the economic provisions."
</P>
<P>
In his letters, the president also stressed that his desire to
amend the Constitution stems from his commitment to the Filipino
masses "to make the country globally competitive so that we can
improve the life of the poor."
</P>
<P>
The economic amendments that the Philippine government is
proposing include relaxing the constitutional restrictions on the
entry of foreign capital into the country.
</P>
<P>
These reforms, Estrada said, will help fulfill his campaign vow
of rescuing the majority of poor Filipinos from poverty by drawing
in more investments to the country and creating enough jobs here.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Senate majority leader Franklin Drilon proposed that
the two houses of Congress vote separately on the proposed
economic amendments to the constitution.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said he is planning to adopt Drilon's proposal "as far
as economic reforms are concerned."
</P>
<P>
He noted that the economic amendments passed by Congress,
however, will still be submitted to the people for final approval
in a plebiscite.

ISLAMABAD, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan has lodged a
complaint with the United Nations over the shooting down of its
navy aircraft by India and urged U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
to send a fact-finding mission to "ascertain facts about the

Foreign Minister Sartaj Aziz, in a letter addressed to Annan,

the Kargil crisis in Kashmir, "has further increased tensions in
the region," said an official handout Thursday.

Aziz said "the false and misleading claims" made by the Indian
side regarding the incident "remain a continuing source of

<HEADLINE> Manila to Study Legality of Latest Oil Price Hikes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada said Thursday that he has ordered the Department of Energy
(DOE) to study the latest round of oil price increases to
determine if they are reasonable and legal.
</P>
<P>
The president said the study by DOE Secretary Mario Tiaoqui,
along with the other probes made by his economic managers on the
latest oil price increases, will be consolidated to determine
their overall impact on inflation and wages.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the president ordered the DOE to study ways to
mitigate the impact of oil price increases on consumers.
</P>
<P>
"I had already instructed Secretary Tiaoqui to study this,
whether it's reasonable, whether it's legal," the president said
in a news release.
</P>
<P>
Estrada was reacting to reports that several senators have
called for the filing of charges against Petron, Pilipinas Shell
and Caltex Philippines, the country's three big oil companies for
allegedly violating anti-trust laws by continuously increasing the
prices of petroleum products.
</P>
<P>
Petron increased its pump prices by as much as 40 centavos (1
U.S. cent) per liter effective Monday. Pilipinas Shell followed
suit on Tuesday by raising its prices by as much as 39 centavos
(0.975 cent) per liter.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the president said petitions for wage increases will
continue to be determined by the regional and provincial wage
boards, which will study the factors for granting pay adjustments
by region or by province.
</P>
<P>
He said a thorough study is needed to balance the need of wage
adjustments, the possible effect on inflation, and the need to
continue attracting investments before deciding on whether or not
to grant pay increases.

<HEADLINE> Iran's President Presses for Administrative Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami on Thursday pressed for "fundamental changes" in Iran's
bureaucratic system in order to meet the needs of economic
development.
</P>
<P>
"Political development should come parallel with economic and
cultural development," Khatami said at a ceremony here honoring
late President Mohammad Ali Rajaie and Prime Minister Mohammad
Javad Bahonar, who were killed in a 1981 bomb attack by opposition
Mujahedeen Khalq.
</P>
<P>
Since his election as president in 1997, Khatami has been
advocating the establishment of a civil society in the Islamic
Republic. This idea is now embodied in a development plan
prepared by his cabinet for the next five years.
</P>
<P>
Khatami said that the plan makes clear "means for a balanced
and acceptable standard in political, economic, social and
cultural grounds" and that putting it into practice "requires
fundamental restructuring in administrative system."
</P>
<P>
He envisaged a smaller, but stronger government after the
administrative reform. Only administrative restructuring can rouse
public participation in carrying out the economic development
plan, he explained.
</P>
<P>
He said immediate steps should be taken to make good on past
backwardness in political, economic and social fields, despite
many difficulties.
</P>
<P>
Any changes to the current system will surely encounter
opposition form conservatives and rightists. Khatami urged for
patience and prudence, and an impartial attitude above politics.
</P>
<P>
"We, officials and political groups claiming to be
representing the nation, should ask ourselves whether we have
obtained the understanding not to sacrifice national interests
for factional preferences and narrow-mindedness," the president
asked.
</P>
<P>
The development plan, which is the third five-year program to
be implemented from March 21, 2000 to March 20, 2005, will be
submitted to the Majlis (parliament) for approval in the next few
days.
</P>
<P>
Khatami said the new development plan is not ambitious but it
will help give an impetus to the current state of affairs.
Wobbling economy has been the main problem for Khatami's moderate
government. People complain about deteriorating economic
situation, falling living standards, skyrocketing inflation and
growing unemployment.
</P>
<P>
The government has decided to carry out a privatization drive
to hand over state-owned businesses to people, and thus their
responsibilities, in an attempt to bolster the economy.

<HEADLINE> Bus Falls Into Reservoir, 80 Feared Killed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 26 (Xinhua) -- At least 80 people were feared
killed Thursday when an overloaded private bus plunged into a
reservoir in south India, the Press Trust of India (PTI) reported.
</P>
<P>
The packed bus fell into the reservoir at Hucchangi Durga,
about 270 kilometers northwest of Bangalore, capital of the
southern state of Karnataka, the PTI said.
</P>
<P>
Seven bodies had been recovered from the reservoir, about 30
kilometers from Davangere, a district headquarters, the PTI quoted
a local police officer as saying.
</P>
<P>
Rescue operations to locate the dead or possible survivors were
on with seven heavy-duty cranes called into service to pull out
the bus from the reservoir, according to the police.
</P>
<P>
Local fire brigade had deployed divers to fish out the bodies,
the PTI said.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> China's Vice-Premier Says Greater Technological Effort Needed (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
China is working toward its third strategic goal and the
economy is entering a new development phase, he said, and further
adjusting the economic structure and significantly improving the
quality of the economy are important for solving deeply-rooted
economic problems and speeding up scientific and technological
developments.
</P>
<P>
The main direction and priorities of technological development
need to be defined, he said. Efforts should be made to upgrade
traditional industries with high technology and to step up the
development of the high-tech industry per se.
</P>
<P>
To enhance technological development, increasing reforms and
establishing systems conducive to scientific advance are important,
he said, adding that enterprises should be the main body of the
technological development and their ability needs to be raised
significantly.
</P>
<P>
The premier also calls for efforts to encourage the growth of
privately-owned enterprises, saying that they are a rising force
for technological development in China.
</P>
<P>
While encouraging research institutes and universities to
cooperate with enterprises, more fund will be provided for
technological development efforts, he said.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Premier Li Lanqing also reported on technological
developments on behalf of the CPC Central Committee and the State
Council.
</P>
<P>
He said that recognizing the importance of technological
developments and their industrial use is important and that these
developments can become the force behind social advance and
economic growth only when they are turned into real productive
forces.

<P>
BEIJING, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Premier Zhu Rongji, addressing
the final session of a national conference on technological
development here today, said that there need to be more concrete
ways to implement the country's strategy of revitalization through
science and education.
</P>
<P>
Zhu asked Party and government departments and scientists to
work with a sense of urgency and greet the new century with new
developments because increasing and industrializing technological
developments has a direct bearing on China's status and
competitiveness in the next millennium
</P>
<P>
There needs to be a deeper understanding of the significance
and urgency of technological development, said Zhu, who is also
member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the
Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
In the rapid scientific progress of today, a country's overall
strength and competitiveness depend largely on its level of
scientific and technological development, and the development of
technology and high-tech industries needs to be accelerated if the
nation's economy and defense are to be safeguarded.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the four-day conference was to rally people to
boost China's technological developments and their industrial use.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, President Jiang Zemin spoke at the opening session,
where he emphasized the country's need for a great leap forward in
technological development.

WASHINGTON, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>

smuggling charges in a series of predawn raids on Wednesday at
their homes by federal agents, thus ending a two-year government
sting operation at Miami International Airport.
</P>
<P>

charged political debate about China's alleged theft of nuclear
secrets, the government's legal case against its prime suspect
appears to be falling apart.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>

<HEADLINE> Heyns Sets Her Sixth World Record in Six Weeks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The South African clocked two minutes 24.42 seconds to clip 0.
09 seconds of her previous record. Heyns's world mark was the
eighth set by competitors at the Sydney championships.
</P>
<P>
"With all the world records in the last week, I was getting to
a stage where I felt the pressure of having to set another one,"
Heyns said. "(So) that was the focus tonight: to be really
relaxed and to have fun, to enjoy every bit of that race for what
it was."
</P>
<P>
By contrast, Australia's Susan O'Neill failed in what may be
her last best chance to erase the oldest surviving mark in world
swimming. She has spent the better part of the past decade
chasing American Mary T. Meagher's 200m butterfly world mark of 2:
05.96 set at Brown Deer, Wisconsin in September 1981.
</P>
<P>
The reigning world and Olympic champion has not lost a 200m
butterfly race in almost five years, but says she will not rest
until she breaks the record.
</P>
<P>
The 26-year-old thought her moment had finally come after she
saw American Jenny Thompson wipe Meagher's 100m record from the
books earlier in the week, and she got within half a second of the
time in Wednesday's semi-finals.
</P>
<P>
She was well under Meagher's record pace at the 150 mark of the
final but tired in what her coach called an "atrocious" final lap.
Her 2:06.60 was almost four seconds clear of the silver medalist
Misty Hyman but still short of the record.
</P>
<P>
Australia won three of the four gold medals on offer on
Thursday to bring their their gold medal tally to 11, comfortably
clear of the United States who have just six after five days of
competition.
</P>
<P>
Michael Klim, the swimmer of the meet at last year's world
championships, collected his third gold at the championships by
taking the men's blue riband event, the 100m freestyle in 48.98
seconds.
</P>
<P>
Like O'Neill, the shaven-headed Klim was under world record
pace when he tumble-turned for the final sprint home, only to fade
in the final few strokes.
</P>
<P>
Neil Walker of the U.S. finished second behind Klim in 49.17
with Australia's Chris Fydler third in 49.42
</P>
<P>
Australia's Simon Cowley completed the men's breaststroke
double by winning the 200 final in 2:12.98. The Commonwealth
champion trailed American Tom Wilkens through the first 150 meters
before passing over him on the decisive lap to a comfortable win.
</P>
<P>
Wilkens took the silver in 2:13.97 with South Africa's Terence
Parkin third in 2:14.12. American Kurt Grote, the world champion,
finished a disappointing fifth.
</P>
<P>
The Americans' lone win of the day came in the final event when
their 4x200m freestyle quartet sped away to win, well ahead of
Australia and Canada.

<HEADLINE> French Greens Protest Before McDonald's Restaurant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Several hundred militants of the
French Greens demonstrated at lunch time Thursday in front a
McDonald's restaurant in Lorient, western France, in protest of
the arrest of a peasants' union leader, according to local media
reports.
</P>
<P>
About 400 people gathered in a peaceful way asking for the
release of Jose Bove, the leader of the Peasants' Confederation,
who was put in jail recently after some peasants of his union
ransacked a McDonald's restaurant under construction in Aveyron,
southern France.
</P>
<P>
The peasants accused the United States of taking protectionist
measures to impose on Europe its hormone-fed beef products through
an arbitration of the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, about 30 peasants protested Bove's arrest on
Thursday in front a McDonald's restaurant at the tourist seaside
boulevard of la Promenade des Anglais in Nice, southern France.
</P>
<P>
The protesters also sold natural food at a symbolic price of 10
francs (1.7 U.S. dollars) to protest what they called "uniform
food" from the United States.

<HEADLINE> Minister: Russia to Continue Modernizing Nuclear Arms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
MOSCOW, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Russia will continue to
modernize nuclear weapons, Deputy Minister for Atomic Energy Lev
Ryabev said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Attending a special meeting on the 50th anniversary of the
first Soviet nuclear test at the Russian Federal Nuclear Center in
Sarov, Nizhny Novgorod region, Ryabev said the modernization drive
aims to improve the weapons' safety, to extend the service life of
the existing nuclear arsenal and to maintain its research and
development potential through laboratory simulation.
</P>
<P>
Another goal is arms modernization in conditions of advancing
anti-missile defenses, the Interfax news agency quoted him as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Ryabev also named as the main objective for today the
development of a compact nuclear system.
</P>
<P>
He said that in the process of disarmament, Russia has slashed
more than 90 percent of the production of its nuclear arms. Under
plans extending to 2005, the industry staff should be reduced from
75,000 to 35,000 and the number of facilities making nuclear
weapons from four to two.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, despite its limited financial resources, Russia is
doing its utmost to maintain its nuclear potential at due
standards.
</P>
<P>
The remaining weapons are not inferior to the ones "held by
the strongest owners of nuclear arms," he said.

DHAKA, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government has
formed a high-powered task force to determine what benefits the
proposed transshipment facilities to be provided to India will
bring to the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
The 12-member task force comprising both official and
unofficial representatives will submit a full-fledged report to
the government on various aspects of the proposed transshipment,
an official handout said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Members of the task force will hold their first meeting on
August 30.
</P>
<P>
The Bangladeshi government late last month approved in
principle a proposal of examining and discussing the transshipment
of Indian goods through Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
Right after the approval was made, the opposition parties
strongly denounced the government decision, saying it "would
ultimately jeopardize security" of the country.

CANBERRA, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The Australian stock market
finished higher Thursday but drew little inspiration from some
sound profit results and another record close on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark all ordinaries index gained 12.8 points to

</P>
<P>
Macquarie Nevitts adviser Rod Graham said the performance was
relatively disappointing, given the domestic and overseas leads.
</P>
<P>
"Resources definitely dragged us back, although industrials
held up reasonably well and banks were strong," he said.
</P>
<P>
The all industrials index climbed 38 points to 5,263.3 and the
all resources index slipped 13.6 to 1,313.1 points.

Engineering Research Committee of Canada.
</P>
<P>

and technology development strategy should be helped by the NSFC,
which should give more support to basic study that has an impact
on development.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan, Afghanistan Agree to Settle Transit Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan and Afghanistan have
agreed to resolve the controversy over the Afghan Transit Trade
Agreement (ATTA), officials here said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A high-level delegation of the Afghan Taliban Thursday
exchanged views with Pakistani authorities on the ATTA here and
the two sides decided to address each other's reservations, the
sources said.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban assured Pakistan that they will check the smuggling
of Pakistani goods and urged Pakistan to release the detained
goods at Karachi port which had been imported by Afghan traders
under the ATTA.
</P>
<P>
The two countries signed the treaty in the 1960s in a bid to
facilitate foreign trade of Afghanistan, which has no sea port.
</P>
<P>
Islamabad imposed restrictions on the ATTA in 1997, arguing
that much of the goods imported under the ATTA were smuggled back
into Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Taliban militia are unhappy over the restrictions
and have been calling for removal.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban delegation, which arrived here Tuesday for a
three-day visit, also discussed with Pakistan the issue of Afghan
refugees in Pakistan, said the sources.

<HEADLINE> Hatoyama Announces Candidacy For DPJ Leadership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Yukio Hatoyama, deputy secretary
general of the Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ), formally declared
Thursday his candidacy against his long-time ally Naoto Kan for
the presidency of Japan's largest opposition party.
</P>
<P>
"A general conservative trend is taking root in Japan,"
Hatoyama told a news conference in announcing his bid for the
party leadership.
</P>
<P>
"I hope to hoist the flag of a new liberalism against that
trend," he said.
</P>
<P>
Hatoyama made the announcement shortly after conveying his
decision to Kan at party headquarters.
</P>
<P>
Kan, the incumbent leader of the DPJ, has already announced his
bid for reelection in the party presidential race slated for
September 25.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Takahiro Yokomichi, chairman of the DPJ executive
council, also signaled his intention to join the race.
</P>
<P>
Some DPJ members welcome the probable showdown among the three
political heavyweights because it would allow voters to understand
the party's policy debates. But others fear that the already
fragile unity of the party could be further damaged.
</P>
<P>
Hatoyama and Kan co-headed the DPJ when it was launched in
September 1996.
</P>
<P>
Kan became the party's sole leader in April 1998 when the DPJ
expanded by absorbing former members of other parties such as the
Good Governance party and the Amity Party.
</P>
<P>
Dissatisfaction among party members is brewing over Kan's
leadership as the party's popularity, widely believed to hinge on
Kan's personal appeal, has weakened recently.
</P>
<P>
The party's support rate fell to 10.4 percent in a survey
conducted by the Kyodo News Service in late May, down from 22.8
percent last September.

<HEADLINE> Britain Rules IRA Ceasefire Intact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Northern Ireland
Secretary Mo Mowlam Thursday ruled that the Irish Republican Army'
s ceasefire had not been violated.
</P>
<P>
Mowlam also said she would not halt the early release of
republican prisoners.
</P>
<P>
"Although the situation in relation to the IRA is deeply
worrying, I do not believe that there is sufficient basis to
conclude that the IRA ceasefire has broken down. Nor do I believe
that it is disintegrating or that these recent events represent a
decision by the organization to return to violence," Mowlam said
in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Mowlam came under increasing pressure to make a statement after
the province's police chief, Ronnie Flanagan, Wednesday blamed the
IRA for the paramilitary-style execution of a Belfast man last
month. She also looked into claims of a plot to run guns from the
United States to Ireland.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein, the IRA's political wing, says it believes that the
IRA has not breached the ceasefire declared in July 1997.
</P>
<P>
But pro-British unionist politicians accused the IRA of being
involved in the shooting and weapons smuggling from the United
States to Ireland.
</P>
<P>
The IRA declared an "unequivocal" ceasefire in July 1997 but
punishment beatings and shootings, from both sides of the
sectarian divide, have continued ever since.
</P>
<P>
Talks on implementing a Northern Irish peace deal signd in
April last year have been frozen until September as Protestant
politicians refuse to share power with Catholic republicans in the
Sinn Fein party until its guerrilla ally, the Irish Republican
Army (IRA), disarms.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Secrets Spill Out on Internet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, August 26 (Xinhua) -- A Canadian top-secret
eavesdropper posted the names and location of Canada's F-18 pilots
based in Italy on his own web page before and during the war in
Yugoslavia, the Globe and Mail newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Master Corporal Real Arsenault set up his web page in 1998 and
invited readers to share his "experience with the Canadian F-18
squadrons at Aviano Airbase, Italy," the report said.
</P>
<P>
He was in Aviano between August and December 1998 to reprogram
the Canadian F-18s' sophisticated radar warning system, which
alerts pilots to incoming surface-to-air missiles and enemy
aircraft.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted him as acknowledging in an interview this
week that he posted on the web the names of at least two pilots to
be on the bombing missions over Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
This was in the context where the Defense Department insisted
throughout the bombing campaign that the pilots' identities remain
secret in fear of possible reprisals, the report said.
</P>
<P>
He shut down his web page days after NATO began bombing
Yugoslavia on March 24 to protect Canada's F-18 pilots "from
possibly being targeted" by the Serb army, the report added.
</P>
<P>
In an ambiguous response, a Defense Department spokesman has
said MCpl. Arsenault voluntarily decided to pull his web page off
the Internet because he did not like the "look" of it, while the
country's intelligence experts described it as "an embarrassing
gaffe and a serious breach of security," according to the report.

BRUSSELS, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission granted
on Thursday another two million euros (2.1 million U.S. dollars)
as extra emergency aid to quake-stricken Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The new aid increased the European Union's humanitarian
assistance to the country to four million euros. The 15-nation
bloc offered two million euros last week after Turkey was hit by a
devastating earthquake on August 17.
</P>
<P>
The EU aid, to be managed by the European Community
Humanitarian Office, will enable international organizations to
provide immediate relief supplies to the areas worst hit by the
earthquake.
</P>
<P>
The death toll has reportedly risen to at least 15,000 with
some 200,000 people made homeless around northwestern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The EU aid will focus on such relief supplies as tents,
blankets, medical supplies, mobile clinics, kitchens, water
purification systems and sanitation items.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Accuses U.N. Committee of Blocking Contracts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Trade Ministry said on
Thursday that the U.N. Sanctions Committee had suspended eight
new Iraqi contracts for oil and electricity sectors that Iraq
signed under the oil-for-food program.
</P>
<P>
An unnamed spokesman for the ministry, in a statement carried
by the Iraqi News Agency, held the U.S. and British
representatives in the Sanctions Committee responsible for the
suspension of those contracts.
</P>
<P>
"Those contracts have been suspended under feeble pretexts by
the U.S. and British representatives during the sessions held on
18th, 24th and 25th of this month," said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Under the oil-for-food deal, now in its sixth phase, Iraq is
allowed to export limited amount of oil in six months to buy food,
medicine and other humanitarian supplies for its 24 million
people.
</P>
<P>
Since the fourth phase of the deal, the ceiling of the amount
of oil Iraq is allowed to sell has been raised to 5.2 billion
U.S. dollars from 2 billion dollars for the first three phases.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad has long accused the U.S. and British envoys in the
Sanctions Committee of hampering the endorsement of its
contracts, arguing that the oil-for-food deal has failed to
alleviate the suffering of the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Trade Ministry announced earlier this month that a total
of 457 of its contracts worth 756 million U.S. dollars signed
under the fifth phase of the oil-for-food deal are still blocked
by the Sanctions Committee.

<HEADLINE> China to Eliminate Unreasonable Fees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 26 (Xinhua) -- In a bid to promote economic
growth, China has reiterated that all unreasonable levies on
farmers, enterprises and various other sectors in China must be
banned, according to a circular issued by the Ministry of Finance.
</P>
<P>
The latest notice urged all local governments to stop
collecting such fees, stressing that the amount of money collected
from farmers for public use should not exceed that of 1997.
</P>
<P>
It insists that concrete measures should be taken to implement
decisions of the central and local governments on canceling
unreasonable charges which have been levied against enterprises
since 1997.
</P>
<P>
It says that the ministry will soon issue a joint statement
with other government departments announcing the cancellation of a
number of government debts and charges on enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The practice of levying unreasonable charges on overseas-funded
enterprises must be halted, the ministry says, adding that some
charges must also be reduced to further improve the investment
environment.
</P>
<P>
Charges relating to imports and exports, including port tolls,
will be readjusted or lowered to encourage exports, it says.
</P>
<P>
Steps must be taken to rectify charges linked with housing
construction and trading to curb the irrational price rise of real
estate in a bid to boost the housing market.
</P>
<P>
The circular called for a halt in collecting excess fees for
car purchase except those approved by the State Council, and no
new charges will be allowed during the registration and use of
motor vehicles, except those approved by government departments at
provincial level or above.
</P>
<P>
The notice says that no central government department has the
right to issue documents or ask localities to levy charges except

jointly by the Finance Ministry and the State Development Planning
Commission.

<HEADLINE> Pinochet to Have Medical Check in London, Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, Aug 26 (Xinhua) -- Former Chilean leader Augusto
Pinochet, curretly under house arrest outside London, was
scheduled to visit a clinic on Thursday for medical checks, a
Reuters report said.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted members of Pinochet's British legal team as
saying that a Chilean newspaper which said that the 83-year-old
retired general would have his motor skills examined was "probably
accurate."
</P>
<P>
But the team did not say exactly where he was going or give
details of his condition.
</P>
<P>
A newspaper in the Chilean capital of Santiago, La Segunda,
reported recently that it had spoken to Pinochet by telephone and
the general said he had trouble walking. Pinochet told the paper
that he has "ups and downs, just like the weather."
</P>
<P>
Pinochet was arrested in a London hospital last October while
he was recovering from a minor back surgery. A Spanish judge
accused him of responsibility to the deaths and disappearances of
3,000 people and wanted him be extradited to Spain to face the
charges.
</P>
<P>
Extradition proceedings are scheduled for September 27.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet is now house-arrested in a hired mansion in the south-
west suburb of London. Each time he goes to a doctor for tests,
an increasingly frequent occurence in recent months, the police
accompany him.

<HEADLINE> 22nd UPC Holds General Debate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 26 (Xinhua) -- A general debate on the theme of
the "Universal Right to Communication -- Challenges and
Opportunities for the Post" took place today during the ongoing
22nd Universal Postal Congress (UPC), which is being held in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The debate is believed to be part of the Universal Postal Union
(UPU)'s effort to establish an action program for the development
of the world's postal service and the international organization
for the next five years.
</P>
<P>
Wang Zhanning, chairman of the congress, said before the
discussion commenced that it is necessary and urgent to re-
evaluate the concept of the "universal right to communication",
and commercial profit will not be the only or the final purpose of
postal enterprises.
</P>
<P>
"What is more important is how to maintain a sustainable
development of these postal enterprises," he said.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from more than 180 countries and 31
international organizations participated in today's debate and the
decisions agreed will become the basis of the "Beijing Postal
Strategy" which is expected to be passed before the congress ends.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing Postal Strategy will be in two parts, one focused
on actions to be taken by governments and regional postal unions,
and the other on the actions of the UPU's permanent committees.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the draft of the second part has been
completed and will be delivered to the congress for further
discussion.

<HEADLINE> Overseas Investment Drops 29 Percent in Half Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Cash inflow into overseas-funded
enterprises in China dropped by 29 percent year on year to some 20
billion U.S. dollars in the first half of this year, according to
the State Administration of Industry and Commerce today.
</P>
<P>
China approved 7,222 overseas-funded ventures in the January-
June period, and this figure was 21.5 percent lower than that of
the same period last year, the administration said.
</P>
<P>
These newly-approved ventures, which are mainly in the fields
of real estate, agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, fishing,
mining, finance and insurance, had a total registered capital of
11.3 billion dollars, down 13 percent from a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
According to the administration, overseas investors showed
increasing interests in the less-developed central and western
parts of China. In the central parts alone, overseas investment
grew seven percent to 810 million dollars in the half-year period.
</P>
<P>
Most of the overseas investment came from Hong Kong, the United
States, Taiwan, South Korea, and Australia. Investment by
Australian investors rose by more than 100 percent on a year-on-
year basis.
</P>
<P>
By the end of June this year, China had approved the
establishment of a total of 220,000 overseas-funded enterprises,
involving total investments of 780 billion dollars.

PARIS, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The French government has released
Pierre Bunel, the army officer accused of spying for Yugoslavia
during his mission at the NATO Military Committee in Brussels,
Agence France-Presse quoted his lawyer, Eric Najsztat, as saying
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Bunel, 46, was the head of the cabinet of general commander of
the French military representation at NATO when he was arrested on
October 31, 1998, in Paris for "intelligence with the enemy."
</P>
<P>
The lawyer refused to provide further details on Bunel's
release.
</P>
<P>
Bunel was suspected of telling Yugoslavia which targets NATO
would strike in its air operation, when NATO was preparing to
strike Yugoslavia in September and October 1998 over Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
He admitted having passed secret information to Yugoslavia, but
said he did so out of sympathy for the Serbs and not for money.

<HEADLINE> A Chronology of Lee Teng-hui's Separatist Activities (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Xinhua today released a lengthy
article exposing Lee Teng-hui's efforts to split Taiwan from
China over his past 11 years in office, and how these efforts
culminated in his total denial of the "one China" principle when
he made his "two-states" remarks.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with a German radio station on July 9, Lee
redefined cross-Straits relations as "state-to-state" relations,
which alarmed the whole world.
</P>
<P>
"Despite many of his recent chicaneries that he was not
changing his policies, Lee Teng-hui had been plotting his steps
carefully toward publicizing his long-standing intention to split
China," the article said.
</P>
<P>
When he first took office, Lee felt he was too weak to speak
his mind, so he declared publicly that "there is no policy of two
Chinas, but rather the policy of one China," the article said.
</P>
<P>
With consolidation of his power in the Taiwan political
arena, he started to gradually shift his position, the article
said, and gave the following chronology of events:
</P>
<P>
-- In May 1990 Lee said the reality of cross-Straits
relations is "one China, two governments."
</P>
<P>
-- In August 1992, he said ,"China is in a state of
temporary separation, governed by two separate political entities.
"
</P>
<P>
-- In February 1993, he told a group of separatist activists
that he had never mentioned that there was only one China, but
spoke of the " Republic of China in Taiwan."

<P>
-- At an APEC meeting in Seattle in November 1993, his "
minister of economy" said that the Republic of China and the
People's Republic of China are two sovereign states, and that one
does not belong to the other, and vice versa.
</P>
<P>
-- During a talk with a Japanese writer in March 1994, Lee
said that "China is a vague word," stressing that his basic idea
was that Taiwan should be Taiwanese.
</P>
<P>
-- The next month, Lee told separatist activists in Taiwan
that "there is no such issue as one China; the two sides across
the Straits are separate countries."
</P>
<P>
-- In July 1994, the Taiwan authorities published a paper
demanding that the world "fully recognize" the fact that the two
sides across the Straits are "two coexisting legal entities in the
international community."
</P>
<P>
-- During his tour to the United States in June 1995, Lee
never ceased preaching that "the Republic of China is in Taiwan
and the People's Republic of China is in the mainland."
</P>
<P>
-- The Taiwan authorities proposed "one divided China" in
February 1997.
</P>
<P>
-- In May of this year, Lee Teng-hui went so far as to
publish a book suggesting that China be divided into seven parts.
</P>
<P>
And only 50 days later, he made his "two-states" remarks
and completed the process of denying the one China principle, the
article said.

<P>
MOSCOW, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Russian federal troops and local
volunteers continued a series mop-up operations Thursday in
several Daghestan villages recaptured from Islamic militants after
a two-week campaign to root out the rebels.
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev, in the southern city of
Ashuluk attending the Comradeship-Arms '99 air defense exercise,
said combat actions against the extremists have terminated as "all
villages have been liberated."
</P>
<P>
"Mop-up operations in the territory are under way," the
minister said.
</P>
<P>
According to the Defense Ministry's provisional press center
in Daghestan, federal warplanes bombed retreating rebels on
Wednesday afternoon near the Kharami Pass.
</P>
<P>
The 2,177-meter pass was used by small groups of gunmen to
cross from Daghestan to Chechnya, a breakaway republic bordering
Daghestan. The Islamic rebels were commanded by Chechen warlord
Shamil Basayev.
</P>
<P>
The federal aircraft hit three trucks with gunmen near Lake
Goluboye and the village of Bunial, the provisional press center
said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, army engineers were clearing mines left by the
rebels. De-mining operation has completed in the villages of
Ansalta and Rakhata where the local mosque and several other
buildings were mined.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Philippine Airlines Reports Net Profit in 2nd Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Airlines (PAL) posted
a net income of 65.4 million pesos (1.6 million U.S. dollars) in
the second quarter of 1999, a financial report of the country's
flag carrier said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The report, which was submitted to the PAL's annual
stockholders' meeting, was a welcome reversal given that the PAL
lost 10.18 billion pesos (255 million dollars) in its last fiscal
year ending March 31, 1999.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, revenues for the quarter reached 6.5
billion pesos (162.5 million dollars), with passenger operations
accounting for 81 percent as the PAL ferried over 13 million
passengers with a fleet of 24 aircraft.
</P>
<P>
Cargo operations contributed 11 percent of the revenues, as the
airline carried more than 22,800 tons of freight and 167.6 tons of
mail during the quarter.
</P>
<P>
On the expense side, total expenses for the quarter amounted to
5.14 billion pesos (128.5 million dollars), allowing the flag
carrier to post an income from operations of 1.36 billion pesos
(34 million dollars) for the period.
</P>
<P>
But the operational profit was diminished by costs on the
financial side, which enabled the PAL to book a modest net income
of 65.4 million pesos (1.6 million dollars) for this period.
</P>
<P>
The report attributed the airline's good April-to-June
performance mainly to the seasonal summer travel rush.
</P>
<P>
The previous fiscal year was an abnormally difficult 12 months
which saw the flag carrier struggling to cope with multiple
challenges in its operating environment.
</P>
<P>
These include the Asian financial crisis, crippling strikes by
the pilots and ground-crew unions and the indiscriminate grant by
aviation authorities of capacity increases to foreign airlines.
</P>
<P>
The combined effects of these factors led to a substantial
downsizing of the PAL's operations and forced an unprecedented
13-day operational shutdown last September.
</P>
<P>
However, the PAL gradually worked its way back to recovery,
capped by the approval of a rehabilitation plan by the government
on May 17 this year and the full implementation of the plan began
in early June upon the infusion of 200 million dollars in new
capital.

<HEADLINE> Giant Bell Will Mark New China's 50th Anniversary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Official go-ahead has been given
for the forging of a giant bell weighing 50 tons to symbolize the
50th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China
on October 1 this year.
</P>
<P>
The bell will be on display at the China 21st Century Altar
memorial scheduled for completion this year, according to its
designer, China's well known sculptor and artist Professor Xiao
Hong.
</P>
<P>
The bell will measure 6.8 meters high and 3.4 meters in
diameter, bigger than the famous Yongle Bell, currently the world'
s largest bell, which is located in the Big Bell Temple in the
northwest of Beijing.
</P>
<P>
To mark the friendship and harmony that exist between China's
56 ethnic groups, the bell, which will be known officially as The
China Bell of the 21st Century, will feature 56 carved peonies,
two massive dragons representing the Yellow River and the Yangtze
River and a relief of the Great Wall representing the courage of
the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
It will be jointly manufactured by the Nanjing Jinling Ancient
Art Bronze Institute and the Jiangsu Metallurgical Machinery Plant
of the Nangang Group.
</P>
<P>
On the eve of New Year's Day 2000, more than one thousand
couples from across the country will take part in a mass wedding
ceremony in the square of the memorial area where the new bell
will be hung.

<HEADLINE> A Chronology of Lee Teng-hui's Separatist Activities (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
 The article went on to expose the fact that Lee has made
tremendous political, military and diplomatic efforts in
preparation for his denial of the one China principle:
</P>
<P>
-- Inside the island, he has taken advantage of the so-
called "constitutional reform" to elbow out political enemies
while conniving at separatism; propagated the rumor of military
threat from the mainland to create chaos and speed up armament; "
reclaimed" Taiwan educational principles to sever cultural ties
with the mainland.
</P>
<P>
-- In handling cross-Straits relations, he refused dialogues
on the peaceful reunification as well as direct links for commerce,
shipping, and postal services with the Chinese mainland.
</P>
<P>
-- In foreign relations, Lee has been trying to "buy support
" from poor and small countries to make the Taiwan issue an
international issue; he catered to anti-China forces by procuring
large amounts of weapons and vying for entry into the so-called "
Theater Missile Defense" system.
</P>
<P>
The article also unmasked Lee's close connection with Taiwan
's most prominent separatist organization, "the Democratic
Progressive Party."
</P>
<P>
"Lee has done many things that the separatists have dreamed
of but never could do," the article said.
</P>
<P>
"All the history is on the record, and the facts are known
to the world, and it is no use for Lee Teng-hui to disavow it,"
the article pointed out, concluding that he is "doomed to have his
name printed on the pillar of shame in Chinese history together
with other traitors to the people."

<HEADLINE> HK Crime Rate Lower Than Many Metropolitan Cities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The overall crime rate of Hong
Kong in the first half of 1999 is still much lower than that of
many other metropolitan cities despite a slight increase during
the period, a senior police officer said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Reviewing the crime situation for the first six months of the
year at a press briefing, Lau Chun-sing, the police director of
Crime and Security, said that a total of 37,162 crime cases were
recorded, an increase of 9.2 percent from 34,025 in the same
period in 1998.
</P>
<P>
There is, however, a significant downward trend in several
categories of serious crimes, such as robberies with genuine
firearms, homicides, burglaries, indecent assaults and serious
narcotic offenses, Lau said.
</P>
<P>
Lau said the overall crime detection rate in the first six
months of the year was 41 percent, comparable to 45.8 percent in
the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
There were 1,655 robbery cases recorded in the first six months
of the year, an increase of 11.1 percent. But certain categories
of robbery in fact decreased, Lau said.
</P>
<P>
Lau said that this was a result of the joint efforts between
Hong Kong police and their counterparts on the Chinese mainland in
combating cross-boundary crimes, and restrictions imposed on the
registration of right-hand-drive vehicles on the mainland, Lau
added.
</P>
<P>
He pledged that joint operations with the Customs and Excise
Department would continue and cooperation with the mainland would
be stepped up.
</P>
<P>
Lau vowed to combat all crimes through crime prevention,
investigations and stepped-up patrols at designated spots. "Our
objective is to enable Hong Kong people to continue to live in a
society of low crime rate," he said.

<HEADLINE> Feature: 3,000-year-old Tortoise Shell Inscriptions Enrich World Cultural Heritage (2) (RECAST) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As they contain one of the earliest written forms of language
in the world, the inscriptions have inspired Japan, Britain, the
United States, Germany, Russia, and nine other countries, and
regions which possess similar bones and shells to establish
special research institutions.
</P>
<P>
Kimboo Hyun, a scholar from the Republic of Korea, said that
Koreans used Chinese characters 500 years ago, and today the ROK
retains 50 percent of the Chinese words in its own language.
</P>
<P>
"The culture in East Asia originates from Chinese inscriptions
on the bones and tortoise shells," Japanese scholar Murakami Kozo
said, adding that "the research into their impact on the world is
far from complete." The Japanese still use a large number of
Chinese characters.
</P>
<P>
Famous American linguistic professor Paul Shao believes that
the culture of the Shang Dynasty and the Tang Dynasty ( 618-907)
had a great influence over Central American culture.
</P>
<P>
His remarks were confirmed following a discovery by Mike Xu, a
young American scholar, who has found 300 markings in Central
America that bear a strong similarity to those on the bones and
tortoise shells found in China.
</P>
<P>
Shao concluded that the exchanges between the oriental and the
occidental cultures started much earlier than previously believed.
</P>
<P>
Foreign countries began to collect ancient bones and tortoise
shells early this century. In 1937 Canadian Menzles Jamesmellon
brought home from China 7,802 pieces of the inscribed bones and
tortoise shells, which now are stored in the Toronto Museum.
</P>
<P>
Researchers now are using computer programs to help understand
some of the most mystifying words.

pro-independence groups in East Timor's capital of Dili on
Thursday, reports from Dili said.
</P>
<P>
Members of the pro-independence National Resistance Council of
East Timor (CNRT) pelted stones at pro-integration campaigners
near the Kuluhan intersection in east Dili.
</P>
<P>
A few minutes later, some pro-integrationists armed with
firearms came to the scene of incident, making the clash
inevitable.
</P>
<P>
The injured, whose identities were unknown, were evacuated to a
nearby hospital, said the reports.
</P>
<P>
The rival factions in the territory are launching campaigns for
the August 30 autonomy ballot.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations is organizing the direct ballot to enable
the East Timorese to accept or reject a wide-ranging autonomy
offered by the Indonesian government early this year.
</P>
<P>
A rejection of the autonomy proposal will mean independence for
the former Portuguese colony.
</P>
<P>
East Timor was integrated into Indonesia in 1976 in a move
never recognized by the United Nations.

<HEADLINE> Rating Agency Revises Upwards Malaysia's 1999 Growth Forecast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The international rating
agency Standard &AMP; Poor's is revising upwards Malaysia's 1999
growth forecast to 5.2 percent from 4.6 percent, Bernama news
agency said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The international rating agency told Malaysia's National
Economic Action Council (NEAC) that the 4.1-percent year-on-year
second quarter gross domestic product (GDP) growth announced
Wednesday has set the stage for a strong second half performance,
Bernama quoted NEAC as saying.
</P>
<P>
The agency said its preliminary forecast suggested that
Malaysia's economic growth could be as high as 9.0 percent
year-on-year in the second and third quarters.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the continued strong recovery, second half growth
will be boosted by the base year effect as Standard &AMP; Poor's saw
exceptionally sharp declines of 10.9 percent and 10.3 percent
year-on-year in the final two quarters of last year respectively,
the NEAC said.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria slashes Phone Installation Fee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government Wednesday
slashed the telephone line subscription fee from 50,000 naira
(about 527 U.S. dollars) to 20,000 naira (about 211 U.S. dollars)
in a bid to bring the facility within users' reach.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian, a leading Nigerian newspaper Thursday quoted the
country's Information Minister Dapo Sarumi as saying in Abuja that
telephone fee was pressed down to facilitate full subscription of
700,000 lines now available nationwide.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that the decision would take immediate
effect, adding that the Nigerian Telecommunications Limited
(NITEL), the country's main provider of telecommunication, had
been slated for reorganization.
</P>
<P>
The NITEL has long been criticized for mismanagement and low
efficiency, and calls for its privatization are high. Despite the
large amount of lines left unused, it is very difficult for this
country to install a new line.
</P>
<P>
The minister also announced the reduction of transfer charges
for telephones from 25,000 naira (about 264 U.S. dollars) to 10,
000 naira (about 106 dollars), while roaming charges for cell
phones have also dropped.
</P>
<P>
Capital mainly from the United Sates has been flowing into the
telecoms industry of this oil-rich west African country since the
reinstatement of civilian rule this May after the 15 years of
destructive management by military regimes.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Arrive in America 3,000 Years Ago: Scholars (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, August 26 (Xinhua) -- New evidence has shown that
Chinese may have arrived in America 3,000 years ago, some 2,500
years earlier than Italian navigator Christopher Columbus who
discovered the new continent.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 300 ancient American Indian character marks, collected
in Central America recently by Mike Xu, show great similarities to
ancient Chinese characters inscribed on animal bones or tortoise
shells 3,000 years ago, known as "Jiaguwen".
</P>
<P>
Xu, a researcher at Texas Christian University, announced his
finding at a just concluded international symposium marking the
centenary of the discovery of Jiaguwen, the oldest Chinese
characters.
</P>
<P>
Xu showed some pictographic markings inscribed on pottery, jade,
and stone items belonging to several American Indian tribes which
had great similarity to Chinese characters in expressing the
concepts of the sun, sky, rain, water, crops, trees, and religion
and astronomy.
</P>
<P>
A number of established Chinese archeologists and linguists,
including Yu Weichao, Li Xueqin, Qiu Xigui, and Wang Yuxin, have
confirmed these similarities after a preliminary study, and they
all agreed that the markings, if not discovered in Central America,
would have been seen as characters in the pre-Qin days or before
221 B.C.
</P>
<P>
"If such markings had been discovered in China, I would have
considered them characters similar to Jiaguwen. " said Chang Yuzhi,
a researcher of the civilizations of the Xia, Shang, and Zhou
dynasties (21st Century B.C.-- 221 B.C.) at the Chinese Academy of
Social Sciences.
</P>
<P>
"The similarity is not an isolated and single phenomenon," said
Fan Yuzhou, history professor at Nanjing University. "It shows a
possible relationship between ancient American culture and Chinese
culture, as different cultures cannot create the same characters
independently."
</P>
<P>
Jiaguwen was first discovered in 1899 by a scholar in Anyang,
the ancient capital of the Shang Dynasty. Some 150,000 pieces of
Jiaguwen now have been unearthed.

<HEADLINE> Afghan Taliban Tighten Security After Kandahar Blast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan ruling Taliban
militia have strengthened security in southern Afghanistan after a
truck bomb blast killed 10 people and narrowly missed their
supreme leader Mulla Mohammad Omar.
</P>
<P>
All roads out of Kandahar, the Taliban's headquarters in
southern Afghanistan, have been under tight monitoring for
bombers, sources here said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The explosion took place late Tuesday after three people had
parked the truck near Omar's house.
</P>
<P>
Taliban security guards had told the people on the truck to
remove it, but they said it had broken down and then left to "look
for help."
</P>
<P>
In the back of the truck were six barrels of explosives, which
went off when the guards tried to remove the truck.
</P>
<P>
According to the sources, the explosive device was very simple,
but the explosion was massive, leaving 10 people dead and dozens
injured.
</P>
<P>
Taliban authorities have blamed the blast on the "enemies of
Islam" but have been careful not to single out suspects.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Arrive in America 3,000 Years Ago: Scholars (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ancient documents record the fact that when the Shang Dynasty
was defeated, the king's son led the remaining people on a journey
to the east. Some scholars believe that they may have crossed the
Bering Strait to North America.
</P>
<P>
"Ancient Chinese had developed superb navigation skills that
could have helped them do that," Fan said.
</P>
<P>
Over the past half century, the origin of the American culture
has remained a mystery. Harvard professor Cordon Ekholm has
developed a culture communications theory insisting that Asian
migrants and adventurers arrived in America much earlier than
Columbus, and created the first civilization on the continent.
</P>
<P>
Paul Shao, a professor at Iowa State University in the United
States, mentioned at the symposium that there are also
similarities between ancient Chinese culture, especially the Shang
culture, and that of early Central America arts and patterns.
</P>
<P>
Mike Xu's comparisons of the ancient cultures of Central
America and the Shang Dynasty show that they both regarded jade
items as the symbol of power, and used them in funeral ceremonies,
as medicines, for expelling ghosts, and the worship of ancestors.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the two cultures formed the same custom of sitting
with knees bended, and they both used slaves, prisoners, and dogs
and chickens as sacrifices.
</P>
<P>
Also, the contents of the myths and fairy tales of the two
societies were almost the same, in figures such as the Moon Hare,
Sun Shooting, Lion Women, and Man with a Dog Head.
</P>
<P>
Anthropological and gene studies have also found that the
American Indians and the Chinese originated from the same ancestor.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 100 years, well-known Chinese scholars such as
Guo Moruo, Dong Zuobin, and Deng Tuo have shown an interest in the
relationship between the east-bound journey of the Shang people
and the Central American culture, but they did not come to any
conclusions because of a lack of evidence at that time.

<HEADLINE> 5,650 Rwandans Granted Refugee Status in Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian government
has granted refugee status to 5,650 Rwandan asylum seekers, a
report by the United Nations High Commissioner of Refugees (UNHCR)
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The latest issue of Milestone, an information bulletin of UNHCR
office in Dar es Salaam, said most of these Rwandans were
registered as asylum seekers last year and acquired refugee status
after Tanzania's National Eligibility Committee (NEC) scrutinized
their identities.
</P>
<P>
The National Eligibility Committee is the Tanzanian body that
is responsible for the determination of refugee status in the
country. It is composed of members from the Office of the
President, Prime Minister's Office, Ministry of Foreign Affairs
and International Cooperation, as well as police and immigration
forces.
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of 1998, the number of new Rwandans
registration was 6, 543, rising rapidly over 1997, the bulletin
said, adding that out of them 2, 778 came from the caseload that
was not repatriated during the mass return in December 1996 while
3,765 were directly from Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
Among the people granted refugee status, 3,956 are from the
Mbuba Transit Center in Ngara district and 1,694 from Mkugwa
Refugee Camp in Kibondo district. The districts are in Kagera
Region bordering Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
The NEC declined to grant refugee status to a total of 146
Rwandan asylum seekers in Tanzania who also came from the 1998
caseload.
</P>
<P>
The committee makes recommendations to the Minister of Home
Affairs who has the power to grant refugee status pursuant to the
Refugees Act of 1998.
</P>
<P>
In 1998 the Tanzanian government made public announcements
urging Rwandan refugees to come forward and register, reassuring
them that they would not be forcefully repatriated to Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
Responding to this assurance, a good number of Rwandan asylum
seekers came forward to register themselves at Lukole Camp in
Ngara district, some after having resided in the camp under the
guise of being Burundians.
</P>
<P>
The Rwandan asylum seekers in Tanzania were then interviewed by
NEC between September and October 1998, but the process of
granting asylum status was formally concluded in June 1999.
</P>
<P>
By June 1999, assisted refugee population in Tanzania amounted
to 393, 437, most of whom came from Burundi, the Democratic
Republic of the Congo, Somalia and Rwanda.

<HEADLINE> New Species of Turtle Found in Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, August 26 (Xinhua) -- A new reptile belonging to the
turtle family was found recently in southeastern Nepal's Koshi
Tappu Wildlife Reserve area, The Kathmandu Post reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The turtle, called the "yellow-bellied turtle," was found in
Koshi river in southeastern Nepal a few months earlier, said Dr.
Christiane Anders, vice director of Amphibian and Reptile
Conservation of Nepal (ARCO-Nepal).
</P>
<P>
With the latest discovery, the number of Nepal's recorded
turtle species has amounted to 13.
</P>
<P>
Turtles are found mainly in wetland of Nepal's southern Terai
area which boasts of at least four protected areas, including
Koshi Tappu Wildlife Reserve area.
</P>
<P>
According to Dr. Anders, of the 13 turtle species, two species
which are called the "yellow-headed turtle" and the "very rare"
are categorized as endangered ones.
</P>
<P>
But with the increase in human population and the subsequent
depletion of habitat in Terai's wetland areas, the turtles -- like
other reptile and amphibian species -- are fast declining, she
said.
</P>
<P>
According to data from Fuhlrott Museum and ARCO-Nepal at
Tribhuvan University's Natural History Museum, a total of 195
fish, 100 reptiles, and 50 amphibians have been recorded in Nepal.
The museum has been showcasing 100 fish, 78 reptiles and 26
amphibians it has so far collected.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian House Representatives Insist Fresh Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's House of Representatives
 Wednesday rejected a joint report of designated committees of the
Senate and insisted a fresh investigation by them into the Senate
president's alleged misconduct.
</P>
<P>
The House, in a motion sponsored by Representative Adams Jagaba
from the country's northern Kaduna state, requires the Senate
committees of the Ethics and Privileges, Judiciary, Human Rights
and Legal Matters, and Security and Intelligence to re-investigate
the matter adequately and make recommendations in a week's time.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian, a leading Nigerian newspaper, Thursday reported
that House members pointed out holes in the report, and then
unanimously approved the move.
</P>
<P>
Senate President Evan Enwerem was accused by the Lagos-based
Tell magazine earlier this month of covering his former theft
conviction and providing wrong information about his age and
family.
</P>
<P>
The accusation shocked the nation at a time shortly after
former House Speaker Ibrahim Buhari resigned and got fined for his
forgery of educational credentials and mis-presentation of age.
</P>
<P>
The Senate started a probe into the allegations following the
accusations and as a result the joint report was submitted to the
country's National Assembly recently. The Senate had Okayed the
report.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-President Hu Jintao
today called on the youth of both China and Viet Nam to cherish
the traditional friendship between the two countries and strive to
bring good-neighborly and cooperative relations into the new
century.
</P>
<P>
Hu, a Standing Committee member of the Political Bureau of the
Communist Party of China Central Committee, met with a delegation
of the Ho Chi Minh Communist Youth Union of Viet Nam led by its
First Secretary Vu Trong Kim at the Great Hall of the People here
this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Hu said China and Viet Nam are close neighbors and that
friendship between their peoples dates back to ancient times. In
recent years, high-level exchange of visits has forcefully pushed
cooperation in several fields at various levels, and upgraded
bilateral ties to a new level, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The vice-president highlighted the importance of friendly
contact between the young people in developing the traditional
friendship and long-term and stable cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Both the Chinese Communist Youth League and the Ho Chi Minh
Communist Youth Union are assistants to the Communist Parties of
the two countries, and strong forces in promoting peace,
development, and social progress, Hu said, adding that the youth
can better fulfill their tasks through communication and
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Vu said the Ho Chi Minh Communist Youth Union will make
unremitting efforts to carry out the spirit of the joint statement
issued by General Secretary Le Kha Phieu of the Vietnamese
Communist Party Central Committee and General Secretary Jiang
Zemin of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, and to
pass on the traditional friendship from generation to generation.

<HEADLINE> A Chronology of Lee Teng-hui's Separatist Activities (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Xinhua today released a lengthy
article exposing Lee Teng-hui's efforts to split Taiwan from
China over his past 11 years in office, and how these efforts
culminated in his total denial of the "one China" principle when
he made his "two-states" remarks.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with a German radio station on July 9, Lee
redefined cross-Straits relations as "state-to-state" relations,
which alarmed the whole world.
</P>
<P>
"Despite many of his recent chicaneries that he was not
changing his policies, Lee Teng-hui had been plotting his steps
carefully toward publicizing his long-standing intention to split
China," the article said.
</P>
<P>
When he first took office, Lee felt he was too weak to speak
his mind, so he declared publicly that "there is no policy of two
Chinas, but rather the policy of one China," the article said.
</P>
<P>
With consolidation of his power in the Taiwan political
arena, he started to gradually shift his position, the article
said, and gave the following chronology of events:
</P>
<P>
-- In May 1990 Lee said the reality of cross-Straits
relations is "one China, two governments."
</P>
<P>
-- In August 1992, he said ,"China is in a state of
temporary separation, governed by two separate political entities.
"
</P>
<P>
-- In February 1993, he told a group of separatist activists
that he had never mentioned that there was only one China, but
spoke of the " Republic of China in Taiwan."

<HEADLINE> Israeli Air Forces Choose New F-16 Engines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Israeli air forces have chosen
the powerful F100-229 engines produced by the American company
Pratt &AMP; Whitney for their new F-16I jets, local daily The
Jerusalem Post reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The report said that Pratt &AMP; Whitney is expected to supply jet
engines for 50 F-16I jets, which Israel just ordered from the
American aerospace giant Lockheed Martin in a deal worth 2 billion
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Israel could also procure a further 60 single-engine F-16I
jets, and Pratt &AMP; Whitney was chosen to be part of that option.
</P>
<P>
Until now, neither Pratt &AMP; Whitney nor the Israeli Defense
Ministry have disclosed the value of the jet engine deal.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made after an intensive competition between
Pratt &AMP; Whitney with another American company General
Electric, which was offering its F100 turbofan.
</P>
<P>
"This is a very significant strategic order from a valued and
long-time customer," the report quoted Louis Chenevert, president
of Pratt &AMP; Whitney, as saying.
</P>
<P>
The F100-229 is the same engine that the Israeli air forces
chose for its delivery of the double-engine F-15I jets over the
past year.
</P>
<P>
The model supplies over 29,000 pounds of thrust, which is a 35
percent increase over earlier jet engines of this family.
</P>
<P>
According to Pratt &AMP; Whitney, the F100-229 is the safest
fighter engine in the U.S. Air Force's history.
</P>
<P>
Currently about 65 percent of the F-16 jets worldwide are
equipped with Pratt &AMP; Whitney engines.

<HEADLINE> Dutch FM: Atmosphere Favorable for Mideast Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Dutch Foreign Minister
Jozias Van Aertsen said Thursday his country believed the current
atmosphere in the Middle East was favorable for the continuation
of the peace process by all parties.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with Jordanian Prime Minister Abdel Raouf
al-Rawabdeh, Aertsen also reaffirmed the role of Holland and the
European Union (EU) in supporting the peace process, and
reiterated his country's keenness to support peace talks on all
tracks to achieve a just and comprehensive peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
Al-Rawabdeh briefed Aertsen on what he called an essential role
played by Jordan in the peace process and its keenness to push
forward the peace talks between Israel, the Palestinians, Syria
and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Aertsen arrived in Amman Wednesday for a two-day official visit
to promote bilateral ties and the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian King Abdullah Bin Hussein, during his meeting with
Aertsen Wednesday, called for an early resumption of Arab-Israeli
peace talks on all tracks to make tangible progress in the Middle
East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian ruler also called on Israel and the Palestinians
to abide by agreements already signed to move forward the peace
process in the region.
</P>
<P>
Aertsen came to Amman after his Norwegian counterpart Knut
Vollebaek, paid a one-day visit to Jordan on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The intensified diplomatic efforts by European countries were
believed to be aimed at highlighting the EU's role as a major
peace broker in the region after Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
came to power after the May elections.
</P>
<P>
During the elections, Barak defeated his predecessor Benjamin
Netanyahu, whose hardline policies during his three years in
office were blamed for the current deadlock in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Barak had vowed to revive peace talks between Israel and its
Arab neighbors after he took office, marking a breakaway from the
hardline policies of Netanyahu.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Malaysian Economy Out of Recession (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's economy recorded
a gross domestic product (GDP) growth of 4.1 percent in the second
quarter of 1999 after five straight quarters of contraction,
marking the country's emergence from the recession.
</P>
<P>
The second quarter turnaround was expected, but the 4.1 percent
growth rate as announced by Bank Negara (State Bank) Governor Ali
Abul Hassan Sulaiman Wednesday was higher than expected.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the economy grew by 1.4 percent in the first six
months of this year compared with a 4.2 percent contraction a year
earlier. The economy contracted by 1.3 percent in the first
quarter this year.
</P>
<P>
The central bank governor said the government's selective
capital controls had helped the country get back on the growth
path by providing the right environment for expansion of economic
activities.
</P>
<P>
The significant rise in GDP in the second quarter was
attributed to a combination of external and domestic factors.
</P>
<P>
On the domestic front, all sectors saw better performance
except for mining which recorded a bigger contraction.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturing, the driving force of the economy, grew by 10.4
percent, agriculture by 8.7 percent and services were a marginal
0.6 percent higher. Construction and mining contracted by 6
percent each. However, the construction sector's performance was
an improvement from the negative 16.6 percent posted in the first
quarter when mining recorded a negative 2.3 percent growth.
</P>
<P>
The GDP growth was achieved against a backdrop of price
stability as measured by the consumer price index which fell to
2.7 percent in the second quarter from 4.0 percent in the previous
quarter and 5.7 percent in the same quarter last year.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, consumption and demand, an indicator of
consumer confidence, have picked up considerably. Total
consumption rose by 4.2 percent in the second quarter with public
consumption growing by 8.7 percent and private consumption by 3
percent.
</P>
<P>
The Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE) had better performance
with its Composite Index staging a 45 percent run-up to 763.4
points between April 1 and August 20 and market capitalization
jumping 53 percent to 498.8 billion ringgit (131.263 billion U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
In the second quarter, sales of new passenger cars rose by 7
percent to 59,780 units, and commercial vehicles by 78.4 percent
to 7,538 units.
</P>
<P>
Imports of consumption goods in U.S. dollar terms were up 16.7
percent compared with a growth of 1.7 percent in the first quarter
of the year.
</P>
<P>
Lending activities also rose with total loans outstanding
increasing as credit growth in the banking system stood at 7.4
percent, just a bit short of the targeted 8 percent. Loans
approved for consumption credit, excluding purchase of passenger
cars, increased to 1.2 billion ringgit (315.789 million U.S.
dollars) during the second quarter from 968 million ringgit
(254.736 million U.S. dollars) in the previous quarter.
</P>
<P>
The jobs market also improved with reported vacancies
increasing to 26,091 in the second quarter from 19,403 in the
preceding quarter.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Malaysian Economy Out of Recession (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As for the external sector, Malaysia enjoyed a trade surplus
for 20 consecutive months up to June 1999.
</P>
<P>
Economists here particularly viewed a higher growth of 20.1
percent in the country's imports, mainly driven by the 17.0
percent increase in intermediate goods and 48.5 percent increase
in capital goods, against a 12 percent growth in exports in June
this year, as positive signs, saying increases in aggregate
spending are crucial for a positive GDP growth.
</P>
<P>
One economist from a stockbroking firm said the higher import
figure reflected that the manufacturing sector is revving up
towards greater recovery.
</P>
<P>
Another economist from a Securities company said the increased
imports of capital and immediate goods are positive signals to the
economy. "To me, this is more of confirming that (economic)
recovery is on the way."
</P>
<P>
They said if the growth of imports continues, especially in
capital or immediate goods, the economy would see better results
in the second half, though the trade surplus could be smaller.
</P>
<P>
At the end of June, Malaysia's net international reserves of
the central bank stood at 31.1 billion U.S. dollars, an amount
sufficient to finance 6.7 months of retained imports, reflecting
the higher trade balance, net inflows of portfolio capital as well
as proceeds from the global bond issue (1 billion U.S. dollars).
Net reserves rose further to 31.9 billion U.S. dollars, sufficient
to finance 6.8 months of retained imports by August 14.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the factors indicated robust economic recovery
for Malaysia. However, they are cautious about regional and global
factors that may impede Malaysia's progress.
</P>
<P>
The central bank governor is confident that for the third
quarter of this year, the GDP figure could be better, saying that
barring any adverse developments in the external sector, the
conditions are in place for a further strengthening of the economy
in the second half.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, growth for the whole year is expected to be
significantly higher than the initial forecast of 1 percent," he
said.

BEIJING, August 26 (Xinhua) -- China has formulated important
scientific policies and measures and made major scientific
developments during the past 50 years, which has greatly improved
the national strength and promoted the country's prosperity.
</P>
<P>
In 1956, late chairman Mao Zedong called on the people to "
march towards science". In the 1980s, Deng Xiaoping emphasized
that science and technology were major productive forces. In the
1990s, the third generation of leaders with Jiang Zemin at the
core promoted a strategy of rejuvenating the nation by promoting
science and education.
</P>
<P>
During the past 50 years, China has gone through many twists
and turns but all the time developing its competitiveness in the
science and technology sector.
</P>
<P>
Less than ten years after the founding of New China the
government issued the National Scientific and Technological
Development Program for the 1956-1967 period, the first of its
kind under the new social structure which provided a solid basis
for the development of atomic physics, electronics, semi-
conductors, automation, computing and other new science and
technology fields.
</P>
<P>
In the 1960s, China successfully developed atomic and hydrogen
bombs and in 1970 China launched its first man-made satellite.
</P>
<P>
Since the implementation of the reform and opening-up policy
in 1978, China has made major investments in 11 major research
projects including the 2.16-meter optical astronomical telescope.
</P>
<P>
China has also made a series of breakthroughs in the field of
biological technology such as the development of hybrid rice and
genetic engineering drugs.
</P>
<P>
In the field of high technology, China has developed, amongst
other equipment, high-performance computers and underwater
surveillance vehicle which can reach depths of 6,000 meters. It
has also developed key technology for new types of advanced
reactors.

Meanwhile, China has encouraged its high technology industry
with the creation of such companies as Founder, Legend and Stone,
which have more than one billion yuan (about 120 million US
dollars) of total assets with over 100 million yuan (12 million US
dollars) in revenue each year.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1998, the 53 hi-tech development zones in China
had reported more than 480 billion yuan (about 58 billion US
dollars) total income, and produced 430 billion (about 52 billion
US dollars) in total industrial output value.
</P>
<P>
Latest statistics show that the number of Chinese research
organizations has increased from around 40 to more than 21,600 and
people involved in scientific research have increased from 50,000
to 2.8 million.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to take this development a stage further there was a
National Conference on Technological Innovation in Beijing From
August 23 to 26.
</P>
<P>
At the conference President Jiang Zemin stressed that the
nation's overall strength and international competitive ability
depended on technology and science and the commercialisation of
the field and that this will have wide-ranging benefits for the
whole country.

<P>
BEIJING, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Nikhom Tantemsapya, Thailand's
ambassador to China, said the Thai government and people are
looking forward to the state visit by Chinese President Jiang
Zemin, and believe that his visit will be successful.
</P>
<P>
He said that Jiang's visit will coincide with the celebrations
of the 72nd birthday of His Majesty Bhumibol Adulyadej, King of
Thailand. Later 50th anniversary of the founding of the People's
Republic of China will be celebrated.
</P>
<P>
"This visit will be of significance for developing Sino-Thai
relations across the century," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Nikhom, Jiang will pay a 4-day visit to Thailand
beginning September 2, and will meet with King Bhumibol Adulyadej,
deliver a speech, and meet with Chinese residing in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Nikhom said that Thailand-China relations have developed
smoothly and high level exchange of visits have taken place
frequently.
</P>
<P>
He referred to the visit by Chinese Foreign Minister Tang
Jiaxuan to Thailand in February this year, adding that Thai
Princess Sirindhorn and Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai visited China
in April, while Li Peng, chairman of the Standing Committee of the
National People's Congress, was in Thailand.

<HEADLINE> Trial of KR Should Not Endanger Peace, Cambodia Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Any trial of Khmer Rouge
leaders should not endanger Cambodia's still fragile peace and
violate the country's sovereignty, Cambodian Foreign Minister Hor
Nam Hong told a visiting U.N. legal team Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Three factors must be considered for trying Khmer Rouge," Hor
Nam Hong was quoted by his spokesman as saying.
</P>
<P>
"First, how to find justice for the victims. Second, the trial
must not rekindle the civil war because Cambodia's peace is still
very young and fragile. And third, any trial must not violate the
country's sovereignty," he said.
</P>
<P>
Hor met with the five-member U.N. team led by Assistant
secretary-general for legal affairs Ralph Zacklin Thursday. The
team, which arrived Wednesday, will hold several meetings with
Cambodian government officials on the possible establishment of a
mixed tribunal to try the Khmer Rouge leaders.
</P>
<P>
Hor said it tallies with the international standards to
establish a Cambodian court with the participation of foreign
judges and prosecutors to try the Khmer Rouge leaders.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations wants to have a majority of foreign judges
in a mixed tribunal and a free hand to control the trial, but the
proposed U.N. plan was rejected by Prime Minister Hun Sen, who
insists that any trial of Khmer Rouge leaders should be controlled
by the Cambodian courts.

</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- Alois Brunner, the lieutenant of Heinrich Eichmann and the
head of concentration camp in Drancy near Paris from 1943 to 1944,
could be tried in absentia in Paris next year for the death of
some 120,000 Jews. Charged with crimes against humanity, Brunner
disappeared after the Second World War and was seen in Syria.
</P>
<P>
-- The Kosovo Serbs presented a plan to divide the province
into two parts or to establish Serb enclaves during the meeting of
the Council of Transition with the U.N. civil administrator
Bernard Kouchner and the Kosovo Albanians on Wednesday in Pristina.
The plan was immediately rejected.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The campaign for the referendum on September 16 on the "
civil concord" law in Algeria is due to begin on Thursday in an

threatened to resign if he fails to win the support from Algerians
for his plan of national reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. Vice President Al Gore is threatened with a "Russia-
gate" because of his support for the financial aid to Russia by
the International Monetary Fund (IMF) during the era of former
Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin. The investigation on a
New York bank involved in laundering IMF money by Russian mafias
could jeopardize the effort for presidency in 2000 by Al Gore.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Asked to Work on Key Structural Framework </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia needs to further
strengthen its key structural framework despite the 4.1 percent
gross domestic product (GDP) growth recorded in the second quarter
of 1999, an official with Asia Salomon Smith Barney said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia should lower non-performing loans and promote more
private investments, Arup Raha, head of economics and marketing
analysis Asia Salomon Smith Barney, told reporters after
delivering his presentation at a seminar on Currency Stabilization
here.
</P>
<P>
"It is still too early to declare victory over the economic
crisis although favorable initial indicators have come to light,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
By managing the longer term probabilities in the economy, he
said, Malaysia would then have a sustainable economic growth which
he felt should be the focus now since things have proven well in
the short term.
</P>
<P>
In the short term, he said, the economy has enough momentum to
protect itself from external shocks and assure investors that it
would perform well till the year end.
</P>
<P>
He said the low interest rate environment would make it easier
for the economy to expand and generate domestic investments to
fuel economic growth.
</P>
<P>
When asked to comment on the expected outflow of capital from
September 1 onwards, he said the economy was well cushioned
against the impact of the outflow of between 5.0 billion ringgit
(1.315 billion U.S. dollars) and 10 billion ringgit (2.631 billion
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
On the ringgit's pegging to the U.S. dollar, he said it had
served the country well in terms of export competitiveness and
promoted the manufacturing sector.
</P>
<P>
This was one of the reasons why the second quarter GDP growth
was higher than expected at 4.1 percent from his three percent
estimation, he added.

<HEADLINE> Catholic Bishop to Stay In Prison </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The decision of the court was taken following claims by
Misago's lawyers last Friday or on August 20, that the priest was
illegally detained, and that he should be granted temporary
release because of poor health, the Rwanda News Agency (RNA)
reported Tlhursday.
</P>
<P>
Misago himself had requested to be granted more time to read
his 300- page case file he said he had only received two weeks
before.
</P>
<P>
The court found all the claims by Misago and his defense
council legitimate, but refused to grant the accused release
because of the gravity of crimes he is charged with.
</P>
<P>
Misago is charged with five counts of genocide, creation of
armed militia, and complicity in genocide.
</P>
<P>
Because of crimes of genocide and crimes against humanity
Misago is accused of, there is fear that he might escape, or that
his release might cause public insecurity,'' declared the
president of the court, who ordered the bishop to remain in
prison.
</P>
<P>
The court also put Misago's appearance to court on September
14.
</P>
<P>
The decision was applauded by the full-packed courtroom, while
to the dismay of the church senior officials including the Pope's
Nuncio, Salvatore Penacchio, the Archbishop of Kigali, Thaddee
Ntihinyurwa, and many priests and nuns who were curious about the
bishop's fate.
</P>
<P>
Misago, 56, is the first most senior church official to be in
detention for suspected involvement in the 1994 genocide in his
Gikongoro Diocese which claimed the lives of more than 150,000
people.
</P>
<P>
He was arrested on April 14 of this year, a week after he was
seriously attacked by the survivors of Kibeho,100 kms south of the
capital, for having played a leading role in the massacres of more
than 20,000 Tutsis at the local church and nearby villages.
</P>
<P>
The arrest of Misago had worsened the already strained
relations between the Rwandan government and the Roman Catholic
Church which is accused of having closely worked with the former
Hutu genocidal regimes.
</P>
<P>
Many clergymen allegedly participated in the mass-killings of
April- July 1999 genocide in which more than one million Tutsis
and Hutu moderates were massacred.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Optimistic About Lift of EU Fish Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania has expressed
optimism that the European Union may lift a five-month-old ban on
imports from the country's fish products.
</P>
<P>
A team of EU toxicologists, after a three-day inspection in the
country, has found that fish caught from the Lake Victoria are
poison-free. The team will write to EU headquarters their findings
and make suggestions about the next steps to be taken.
</P>
<P>
The four-man team Wednesday met with officials of the
departments of fisheries and quality control in the Ministry of
Natural Resources and Tourism in Dar es Salaam.
</P>
<P>
"We have very high hopes that the EU delegation will recommend
the lifting of the ban on Nile Perch from the Tanzanian side of
Lake Victoria... They were obviously impressed with what they
found," a senior government official was quoted by The Guardian on
Thursday as saying.
</P>
<P>
The team of EU inspectors arrived in Tanzania last Sunday. It
held consultations with officials of the Department of Fisheries
on the next day and inspected their quality control laboratories
before flying to Mwanza Region on the southern shore of the lake
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In Mwanza, the EU delegation inspected two fish processing
factories -- Nile Perch Fisheries and Tan Perch -- before
examining one fish products landing site.
</P>
<P>
In March, the EU announced a ban on imports of fresh fish
fillets from Tanzania, Kenya and Uganda, following reports that
fishermen were using pesticides in fishing activities in Lake
Victoria, a practice that threatens food health.
</P>
<P>
The ban dealt a heavy blow to the foreign trade of the three
countries, with Tanzania reporting a daily loss of more than
100,000 U.S. dollars in foreign exchange earnings.
</P>
<P>
Following the ban, Tanzania has strengthened patrols on the
lake to fight illegal fishing practices using explosives or
chemical substances.

<HEADLINE> China's Overall National Strength Growing Substantially (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Over the last fifty years China
has become substantially stronger as a nation with its people
enjoying higher standards of living while it has also contributed
greatly to a stable and prosperous international community.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that China's gross domestic product (
GDP) stood at nearly eight trillion yuan (about 960 billion U.S.
dollars) in 1998, 117 times the 1952 figure.
</P>
<P>
Taking into account price changes, China's economy has been
growing at an annual rate of 7.7 percent, more than doubling the
world's average, and reports from the World Bank showed that China
ranked 7th in the world in terms of economic growth and
development in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Fifty years after the founding of the People's Republic of
China in 1949, the long periods when a shortage of commodities had
affected the country had become part of history and the 1.25
billion Chinese, some one-fifth of the world's total population,
have now been provided with adequate food and clothing.
</P>
<P>
China's output of grain, meat, cotton, fruits and many other
products now lead the world with per capita output growing rapidly
as well.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji has stated that China is not only
able to feed its own people from just 10 percent of the world's
arable land but can provide better food for them.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, China's basic industries and infrastructure
construction have experienced tremendous improvements, which laid
a solid foundation for the country's sustainable economic growth.
The staggering amount of investment in energy, raw materials,
communications and telecommunications sectors during recent years
has resulted in the construction of a host of key projects. (

<P>
The rapid economic growth has also brought about a much more
comfortable life for Chinese citizens. In the 1950s, the average
annual per capita consumption stood at a meagre 80 yuan, while the
current figure is 3,000 yuan. The most popular commodities have
also shifted from bicycles and watches, which were mainstays in
the past, to personal computers and automobiles.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the fast growing investment and consumer demand,
China now can boast one of the world's largest potential markets,
which has attracted multinational, blue-chip companies from all
over the world.
</P>
<P>
Since the country adopted the opening up policy twenty years
ago, more than 400 billion U.S. dollars in the form of overseas
investment have found their way to China, covering almost all
fields including agriculture, industry, commerce and finance.
</P>
<P>
This improved overall national strength also enabled China to
withstand the sweeping Asian financial crisis last year, helping
her to keep the renminbi stable in spite of all the pressures,
which has been conducive to the recovery of the Asian economy as
well as helping the stability of the global economy.
</P>
<P>
Latest figures show that China's foreign exchange reserves have
reached 145 billion U.S. dollars, ranking second in the world and
its trade volume is now estimated at 11th in the world league
table.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, China has scored great achievements in the
field of science and technology, making technical innovation a
driving force for economic growth.
</P>
<P>
In addition to success in nuclear and space projects, China has
made great progress in other scientific fields including the
development of transgenic hybrid rice, high-performance concurrent
computers and the application and use of deep sea robots.
</P>
<P>
China has also been maintaining its independent foreign policy
of peace and is playing a more important and growing role in
international affairs. It has become prominent in safeguarding
global peace and establishing a new international order.
</P>
<P>
At present, China is enjoying a healthy economic growth at an
annual rate of seven percent and confidently expects to see a
steady improvement under the current stable political environment.

<HEADLINE> China Winning Population Battle (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Editor's note: This year marks
the 50th anniversary of the People's Republic of China. Over the
past half-century, China's achievements have attracted worldwide
attention: the country's comprehensive national strength has
increased and earthshaking changes have taken place in all sectors.
</P>
<P>
Xinhua News Agency will release 20 reports on these
developments and provide the latest information on the nation's
economy. The first of the series was released on August 17. This
is the seventh.
</P>
<P>
Although China's family planning program has frequently been
criticized by certain negative elements in the West, these critics
have ignored a pertinent fact: the "one child" policy which has
been carried out since the late 1970s has saved China - and the
world - the burden of coping with an extra 300 million people,
which is more than the population of the United States.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to its painstaking family planning efforts, China's
annual population growth dropped from 3.3 percent in the early
1970s to 1.6 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
In the same period, the average fertility rate of Chinese women
fell from six to 1.8, marking a significant sociological change as
traditionally families in China had always been large. Using
United Nations standards China is now listed as a low fertility
rate country.
</P>
<P>
By 1998, China's population stood at 1.248 billion. However,
experts have predicted that it would have been over 1.5 billion
without the introduction of the widespread family planning program
which advocates one child for a couple.
</P>
<P>
They are also convinced that the country's economic success in
the last two decades would have been less impressive, if not
impossible, if it had decided on and implemented any other
population policy.
</P>
<P>
An official of the State Family Planning Commission claims
today that China's population policy has postponed by three years
the arrival of the day when there will be six billion people in
the world. The world's population is expected to hit six billion
in October this year.
</P>
<P>
In general terms, China's population policy has received much
support and encouragement from the international society. Since
the 1980s the United Nations Population Fund has allocated nearly
200 million U.S. dollars for family planning co-operation projects
in China.
</P>
<P>
While speaking to Chinese reporters in Geneva in 1998, Gro
Harlem Brundtland, director-general of the World Health
Organization, commented that China had set an example for
developing countries by controlling the excessive growth of its
population.

<P>
TOKYO, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices closed lower for the
third straight day in Tokyo Thursday, dragged down by profit-
taking following their rise in early trading.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange fell 188.87 points, or 1.06
percent, from Wednesday's close to end at 17,666.29.
</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index, covering all First
Section issues, dropped 13.72 points, or 0.92 percent, to 1,481.08.
</P>
<P>
Turnover on the major section decreased to 549.80 million
shares from 650.14 million Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Fuji Bank was the day's most heavily traded issue.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei index hit the day's high of 17,995.49 before 10 a.m.
(local time), helped by Wednesday's rise on Wall Street, but the
key index remained top-heavy at that level as investors saw no
significant reasons to continue buying, traders said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. dollar's weakness against the yen also dampened share
prices, a dealer said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. dollar was traded at 110.90-92 yen at 3 p.m., down
from 111.31-34 yen late Wednesday in Tokyo, after plunging to 110.
86 yen earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
Exporters were hit by the weakening of the dollar, while
financial issues remained weak, with the banking industry losing 0.
75 percent and the brokerage sector 1.96 percent.
</P>
<P>
Of the issues listed on the First Section, losers outnumbered
gainers 837 to 355, with 123 issues ending unchanged.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Parliament Vows to Investigate Bank Bali Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's House of
Representatives (DPR) on Thursday vowed to investigate the Bank
Bali scandal, in which top government officials are allegedly
involved and which has damaged the banking restructuring program.
</P>
<P>
"We committed to investigate it (the scandal). We are really
concerned on the matter. We are also serious to make
investigations and make it clear," Deputy House Speaker Abdul
Ghaffur told reporters at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
Ghaffur denied the House hampered attempts to probe into the
scandal. "We don't hamper it at all. We even push in order the
probe into the scandal clear as fast as possible."
</P>
<P>
Reports said Bank Bali had illegally transferred 546 billion
rupiah (78 million U.S. dollars) to PT. Era Giat Prima (EGP), a
private company linked to several of President B.J. Habibie's
associates.
</P>
<P>
Several ministers and Habibie's younger brother are also
alleged to be involved in the scandal.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, another Deputy Speaker Hari Subarno insisted that
whatever investigation would be made, it should go by the rule.
</P>
<P>
"Everything must go by the rule," Hari said, adding that there
were no intention to hamper the probe.
</P>
<P>
Hari said the House would also use its right to get information
from president B.J. Habibie in connection with the Bank Bali
scandal.
</P>
<P>
He said the House has sent a letter to the Official Auditor
Board (BPK) to investigate the central bank (BI) and anything in
connection with the internal banking claims guarantee program and
its procedures.
</P>
<P>
"Results of BPK investigation is expected to be completed by
August 31 and then submitted to the House speaker," Hari said.
</P>
<P>
Coordinating Minister for Development Supervision Hartarto said
on Wednesday that all banking cases, including the Bank Bali
scandal, are matters falling under the authority of the Bank
Indonesia (central bank) Governor and the Finance Minister to
settle.
</P>
<P>
He said it there were indications of criminal acts having been
committed such as corruption, collusion or nepotism (KKN).
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Bank Indonesia Deputy Governor Miranda S. Goeltom
said the central bank had already identified the bank accounts
related to the Bank Bali scandal.
</P>
<P>
But because of its position as a central bank, it could not
disclose the outcome of its investigation. "If the Bank Indonesia
finds any indication of criminal action or violation of the law in
the Bank Bali case, Bank Indonesia will report it to the police,"
she said.

<TEXT>
<P>
Since the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949,
improved living standards and health services have led to a drop
in China's overall mortality rate from two percent in 1949 to the
present 0.65 percent; and the mortality rate for new-borns has
fallen dramatically from 20-25 percent to 3.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
In the past half century, the average life expectancy for
Chinese has shot up from 35 years to nearly 71 years, 10 years
higher than the average level in developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Today Chinese people are also receiving better education. China
's illiterate population now accounts for only 12 percent of the
total, compared to 60 percent 50 years ago, while the population
receiving higher education has also increased remarkably.
</P>
<P>
Minority ethnic groups were discriminated against in old China
and their populations have been increasing very slowly, with some
groups even having negative growth rates, as a result of poverty
and bad medical services.
</P>
<P>
The People's Republic of China has introduced special policies
for minority groups to accelerate their development. It even
carries a separate population policy for minority groups: couples
with minority background are immune from the general "one child"
policy. They are allowed to have two children.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the growth rate of minority group populations has
exceeded that of the Han group or the nation as a whole.
</P>
<P>
In 1953, the population of all the 55 minority groups was 35
million, or six percent of the total Chinese population. By 1995,
minority groups were boasting a population of more than 100
million, or nine percent of the national total.
</P>
<P>
Despite its progress in population control, China still faces a
stern challenge. Every year, there are 20 million babies being
born into the country and its population is growing by 12 million.
</P>
<P>
It is predicted by experts that China's population will only
start to reduce by the middle of next century, by which time the
population will have reached a peak of 1.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, despite its widely-acclaimed success story
of the last 20 years, the country is still lagging far behind the
world average level in many social and economic development
indices.
</P>
<P>
In real terms, then, China certainly has a long way to go yet
in controlling and stabilizing its population growth and improving
the quality of life of its citizens for a sustainable development.

<HEADLINE> Manila to Beef up "Concord" Information Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada is planning to set up a speakers' bureau to beef up the
government's information campaign on his call for economic reforms
through Constitutional Correction and Development (Concord).
</P>
<P>
Estrada said Thursday in a news release that the speakers'
bureau will help educate the people about Concord and answer
queries from the public about the issue.
</P>
<P>
"This involves an all-out information campaign. We will
establish a speakers' bureau to explain to people what Concord is
all about, and what our economic reforms mean," he said.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said he is confident that once the issues are properly
articulated, the people will fully support his efforts to
implement economic reforms through Concord.
</P>
<P>
These economic amendments include relaxing the constitutional
restrictions on the entry of foreign capital into the country.
</P>
<P>
These reforms, he said, will help to draw in more investments
to the country and create enough jobs here.
</P>
<P>
He said his administration's call for Concord is the exact
opposite of the previous administration's Charter change move,
which included the much-opposed proposal to extend the term limits
of elective officials.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Estrada said he will meet with former Presidents
Corazon Aquino and Fidel Ramos and, separately, with Manila
Archbishop Jaime Cardinal Sin to discuss Concord.
</P>
<P>
Aquino and Sin had led an anti-charter-change rally on August
20 to protest Estrada's initiative to introduce economic reforms
through Concord.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said he wants to explain separately to Aquino and
Cardinal Sin the motive behind Concord, which is to seek purely
economic reforms to the 1987 Constitution.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said political reforms will have no place in the
Concord process, since these will have to be taken up after his
term ends in 2004.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Postal Reform Vital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Wang Zhanning, the chairman of the congress, noted that the
postal service in most countries fails to meet either customers
needs or demands and most are losing money.
</P>
<P>
"Major problems include the breaking up of postal monopolies
and the emergence of substitutes for mail deliveries such as e-
mail and fax," said Wang.
</P>
<P>
Many countries are boosting efforts to reform the sector most
notably featuring the separating of posts from telecommunications
which have been traditionally linked. Statistics show that by the
end of 1998, 81 percent of the member countries of the Universal
Postal Union (UPU) have set up a separately operated postal system
while a number of countries have allowed private sector
involvement.
</P>
<P>
Developed countries such as the Unites States, Britain, France
and Australia have taken the lead in these reforms.
</P>
<P>
The United States began its postal reform in the 1970s,
abandoning red tape and low efficiency for a high quality service
based commercial operation.
</P>
<P>
And France's postal service looked to a more diversified
operation, especially by expanding its general transport business
and developing postal finance business. These efforts have now
paid off and in 1998 the sector turned in a profit of three
million French Francs after losing money for years.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka also plans to reduce the monopoly of the Sri Lanka
Post (SLP), the state-owned postal operator, to encourage greater
private involvement in the sector and to develop a competitive
environment in the postal service.
</P>
<P>
China, like other developing countries, is considering measures
to reform its postal system. In 1998, financial losses in the
country's postal services reached 14.2 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
China has now introduced a strategy of developing its postal
service using advanced technology and plans to reverse the loss-
making within the three years through to 2001.

<HEADLINE> Feature: 3,000-year-old Tortoise Shell Inscriptions Enrich World Cultural Heritage (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Inscriptions on bones and
tortoise shells dating back 3,000 years and believed to be the
oldest Chinese characters ever found in China are reported to have
recorded 13 solar and lunar eclipses in history.
</P>
<P>
American geophysicist Kevid Peng proved the data to be accurate
after lengthy research.
</P>
<P>
Based on the inscriptions, Peng also determined that the
rotation of the earth at that time was 0.05 seconds quicker than
it is now.
</P>
<P>
"The inscribed bones and tortoise shells are a world treasure,"
he said this week at an international symposium to mark the 100th
anniversary of the discovery of the ancient characters in Anyang
of central China's Henan province.
</P>
<P>
More than 160 Chinese and overseas archeologists and linguists
attended the symposium.
</P>
<P>
For the past 100 years, many people outside China who didn't
read Chinese have studied the calligraphy in hopes of
understanding such inscriptions.
</P>
<P>
The inscribed bones and shells were uncovered in 1899 in a
Chinese pharmacy by Wang Yirong, a Qing Dynasty (1644-1911)
scholar. During the Qing Dynasty, such bones and shells were
mistaken for "dragon" bones, which could be eaten to improve
general health.
</P>
<P>
Bones and tortoise shells dating back to the Shang Dynasty (
16th-11th Century BC), some 3,000 years ago, were used to tell the
oracles from the gods. As a result, the inscriptions are full of
commemorations and astrology, and details about wars, agriculture,
and other aspects of ancient society.
</P>
<P>
So far, nearly 150,000 inscribed bones and tortoise shells have
been discovered in Anyang, also known the Yin Ruins, the capital
of the Shang Dynasty.
</P>
<P>
French scholar Lefeuvre, 77, said that at the time the ancient-
day Yin Ruins was a city with a total area of 30 sq km, Rome was
only a tribal community. He theorized that the inscriptions on the
bones and tortoise shells play an important role in understanding
the early civilization of man.

<P>
As they contain one of the earliest written forms of language
in the world, the inscriptions have inspired Japan, Britain, the
United States, Germany, Russia, and nine other countries, and
regions which possess similar bones and shells to establish
special research institutions.
</P>
<P>
Kimboo Hyun, a scholar from the Republic of Korea, said that
Koreans used Chinese characters 500 years ago, and today the ROK
retains 50 percent of the Chinese words in its own language.
</P>
<P>
"The culture in East Asia originates from Chinese inscriptions
on the bones and tortoise shells," Japanese scholar Murakami Kozo
said, adding that "the research into their impact on the world is
far from complete." The Japanese still use a large number of
Chinese characters.
</P>
<P>
Famous American linguistic professor Paul Shao believes that
the culture of the Shang Dynasty and the Tang Dynasty ( 618-907)
had a great influence over Central American culture.
</P>
<P>
His remarks were confirmed following a discovery by Mike Xa, a
young American scholar, who has found 300 markings in Central
America that bear a strong similarity to those on the bones and
tortoise shells found in China.
</P>
<P>
Shao concluded that the exchanges between the oriental and the
occidental cultures started much earlier than previously believed.
</P>
<P>
Foreign countries began to collect ancient bones and tortoise
shells early this century. In 1937 Canadian Menzles Jamesmellon
brought home from China 7,802 pieces of the inscribed bones and
tortoise shells, which now are stored in the Toronto Museum.
</P>
<P>
Researchers now are using computer programs to help understand
some of the most mystifying words.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Boosts Aviation Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam has been making efforts to
boost the aviation industry and the number of passengers of
Vietnam Airlines has started to increase.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam Airlines carried 1.5 million passengers in the first
seven months of this year, a 4.5 percent year-on-year increase,
Vietnam News Agency reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The figure included nearly 600,000 foreigners, a 10.9 percent
increase over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnam Airlines transportation growth rate in the last two
years dropped by 3 percent due to the regional economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
However, Vietnam's aviation industry continued renewing
technology, raising management capacity, and upgrading and
enlarging airports in efforts to boost its development.
</P>
<P>
The infrastructure and runways of international airports in
Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh City and Da Nang have been upgraded. Eighty
percent of the industry's equipment for flight control have been
modernized in accordance with standards set by the International
Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), and all flight control
equipment will be modernized at the end of 2000.
</P>
<P>
Aviation training programs aim to gradually replace all hired
foreign pilots by Vietnamese. At present, 11 captains and 20
co-pilots qualified to operate Boeing 767 aircraft, and 24
captains and 45 co-pilots qualified to operate Airbus 320 are
Vietnamese.
</P>
<P>
Aviation technicians have been trained in repair and
maintenance of aircraft and air equipment.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Govt Expects Best Result of E. Timor Ballot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government
expects the best result from the autonomous ballot in East Timor,
scheduled for August 30, Minister of Home Affairs Syarwan Hamid
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"We of course expect the best result over the ballot," Hamid
told reporters after a meeting with House of Representatives (DPR)
Commission II here.
</P>
<P>
Hamid said whatever result of the U.N.-sponsored autonomous
ballot would be, Indonesia will accept it.
</P>
<P>
"We will accept whatever the ballot result would be. We have
also had anticipatory planning in connection with the result. We
have already prepared to face the worst possible," he said.
</P>
<P>
But he declined to reveal what kind of planning had been made.
</P>
<P>
"But everything had been prepared as such on how to arrange
refugees, how to conduct hand-over assets (if pro-Jakarta lose)
... We have already had a kind of what we called 'Contingency
Book' to anticipate all options," he said.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the Indonesian government was confident enough of
the pro-Jakarta's success in the ballot, Hamid said: "We are not
unoptimistic. Whatever the result, we will respect it. Because if
I say I am optimistic that pro-integration would success you will
then ask me what the reason is."
</P>
<P>
When asked whether the Indonesian government expected
pro-Jakarta winning, he said the main thing is the best.
</P>
<P>
"And of course you already know too, what is the best I meant,
you know, of course, what the best for our country is," he added.
</P>
<P>
Under a U.N.-brokered agreement with Portugal, Indonesia agreed
to hold the direct ballot on August 30. The ballot will allow the
East Timorese to choose whether their homeland should become an
autonomous region within Indonesia or totally independent.
</P>
<P>
The former Portuguese colony of East Timor was integrated into
Indonesia in 1976 in a move never recognized by the United
Nations, which still considers Portugal as the administering power
of the territory.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian Ministry Freezes Staff Leave for Y2K Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's Health Ministry
has decided to freeze leave for its staff in critical sectors in
preparation for possible system failures because of the millennium
bug or the Y2K problem on the eve of the new year, Bernama news
agency reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"We'll also deploy our officers in the critical sectors to deal
with anticipated problems on the night of December 31 and beyond,"
Health Services Director-General Abu Bakar Suleiman said Thursday
after opening a seminar on national Y2K contingency plans for the
health sector, Bernama said.
</P>
<P>
A recent internal study showed that 95 percent of the
ministry's medical equipment were already Y2k compliant, he said,
adding the remaining five percent would be modified, upgraded or
replaced to be Y2K compliant before November.
</P>
<P>
He estimated that the ministry would be spending 50 million
ringgit (13.157 million U.S. dollars) on tackling the Y2K problem
in its critical sectors.
</P>
<P>
He said the ministry began drawing up its own Y2K contingency
plan and one for the national health sector early last year.
</P>
<P>
It approached the problem through studying the millennium bug's
impact on medical equipment, engineering systems and plants, and
the computerized information and management system.
</P>
<P>
The study on the impact on engineering systems and plants was
started July 1 and he expected it to be fully completed before
November so that remedial action could be carried out before
December.
</P>
<P>
During the study on the 47 computer applications in its
information system, the ministry found that 11 applications were
not Y2K-compliant, he said.

<HEADLINE> East China Province Tackles Aging Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, August 26 (Xinhua) -- East China's Zhejiang Province,
one of the country's economic powerhouses, will take a series of
measures to deal with the problems faced by an increasingly aged
population.
</P>
<P>
These steps will include fostering enterprises related to the
elderly, establishing social service centers, improving the social
security system, and drafting a rational population control plan.
</P>
<P>
According to international standards, a population becomes an
aging one when more than one-tenth of it reaches the age of 60, or
seven percent reach the age of 65.
</P>
<P>
Censuses indicate that over one-tenth of the population of
Zhejiang were at least 60 years old in 1987, and more than seven
percent of them reached 65 in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Sources with the provincial government say that the aging
process has transcended the present level of local economic and
social development, presenting a challenge to nearly every aspect
of society.
</P>
<P>
Along with Zhejiang Province, the municipalities of Shanghai,
Beijing, and Tianjin, and the provinces of Jiangsu, Shandong,
Hunan and Sichuan also face aging populations.
</P>
<P>
Nationwide, China will become an aging country next year, when
130 million people will be 60 years old or older, making up over
one-tenth of the total population.
</P>
<P>
Experts predict that in about ten years the entire world will
be an aging population, sometime around the year 2010.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Economic Targets Not to be Achieved: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 26 (Xinhua) -- All the economic targets set by
the Zambian government this year will not be achieved, Zambia
Association of Chambers of Commerce and Industry (ZACCI) has said.
</P>
<P>
ZACCI chairman George Chabwera said that this year's economic
results would be far worse than what transpired last year when the
country's gross domestic product (GDP) slumped into negative.
</P>
<P>
Zambia Daily Mail newspaper Thursday quoted Chabwera as saying
the 3.5 percent real growth envisaged in the 1999 budget would be
missed as there has been no activity in the economy.
</P>
<P>
He said there has been very low investor confidence because of
the failure to privatize the remaining assets of Zambia
Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM).
</P>
<P>
Chabwera also claimed the inflation rate will not be brought
down to 15 percent, while interest rates have continued the upward
movement, currently averaging 40 percent in major commercial
banks.
</P>
<P>
He added that business has been affected by the consequent
increase in fuel prices and the hike in tariffs by Zambia
Electricity Supply Corporation.
</P>
<P>
Chabwera said 1998 which was described by various companies as
a disastrous year was actually better than this year.
</P>
<P>
He said even levels of unemployment have risen, with crime
becoming rampant as people try to earn a living.
</P>
<P>
And the real sector report produced by the Directorate of Macro
economic Policy Analysis for the first half indicates a down turn
in export earnings.
</P>
<P>
Copper production in the first six months declined by 0.4
percent while exports fell by 11 percent compared to last year.
</P>
<P>
The report also indicates that earnings from major
non-traditional exports have declined compared to last year, with
January to April figures at 3 percent lower.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Expels 2,500 Illegal Foreign Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Jordan has deported some 2,500
illegal foreign workers since January this year to streamline
the labor market.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Residence and Borders Department has caught 30,000
guest workers who violated the country's labor and residency laws
so far this year, the semi-official Jordan Times reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
However, the deported illegal guest workers were believed to
be the tip of an iceberg as nearly one million Arab nationals are
working or seeking jobs in the kingdom with or without work
permits, most of them are Egyptians, Syrians and Iraqis.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian government is imposing stricter restrictions on
the issuance of work permits to the estimated one million foreign
workers, at least 35 percent of whom are jobless, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The measure was aimed at replacing the foreign labors with
Jordanians to bring down unemployment among the Jordanians, which
stood at over 16 percent in recent years.
</P>
<P>
However, most of the laborious jobs in agriculture,
construction or sanitary work currently done by foreign workers
were shunned by Jordanians, either for low pay or lack of social
respect.
</P>
<P>
The number of Egyptians seeking jobs in the kingdom is on the
rise according to a report published by the Central Bank of
Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Some 60 percent of the one million illegal foreign workers in
the kingdom are Egyptians who arrived in Amman as tourists, the
Jordan Times said.
</P>
<P>
Egyptians made up 29 percent of the 1.7 million tourists who
arrived in Jordan between January and May.

<HEADLINE> Australian PM Expresses Deep, Sincere Regret to Aborigines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Australian Prime Minister John
Howard Thursday voiced deep and sincere regret to indigenous
Australians for the injustices they suffered in the past.
</P>
<P>
In a motion passed later by parliament, Howard acknowledged the
past mistreatment of Aborigines and reaffirmed his commitment to
reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
"I move that this House reaffirms its wholehearted commitment
to the cause of reconciliation between indigenous and
non-indigenous Australians as an important national priority for
all Australians," Howard said.
</P>
<P>
He asked parliament to express "its deep and sincere regret
that indigenous Australians suffered injustices under the
practices of past generations, and for the hurt and trauma that
many indigenous people continue to feel as a consequence of those
practices."
</P>
<P>
He also asked parliament to reaffirm "the importance of
practical measures leading to practical results that address the
profound economic and social disadvantage which continues to be
experienced by many indigenous Australians."
</P>
<P>
In the motion, Howard emphasized "the importance of
understanding the shared history of indigenous and non-indigenous
Australians, and the need to acknowledge openly the wrongs and
injustices of Australia's past."
</P>
<P>
"The mistreatment of many indigenous Australians over a
significant period represents the most blemished chapter in our
national history," he said.
</P>
<P>
Howard said the motion was a genuine attempt to further the
cause of reconciliation by the centenary of federation in 2001.
</P>
<P>
"It is an honest and sincere attempt on the part of the
government to make a genuine contribution to the reconciliation
process," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Howard said it was unreasonable and unjust to blame
current generations for the injustices of the past.
</P>
<P>
"The Australian people know that mistakes were made in the
past, the Australian people know that injustices occurred, the
Australian people know that wrongs were committed," he said.
</P>
<P>
"But for the overwhelming majority of the current generation of
Australians, there was no personal involvement of them or their
parents," he added.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Has Fewer Strikes in First Half </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 26 (Xinhua) - The Philippines has 31 actual
strikes during the first half of this year and the figure is 53
percent lower than last year's 66 cases, an official report said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The National Conciliation and Mediation Board (NCMB) said in
the report that for the first six months of the year, the NCMB has
attained a disposition rate of 87.5 percent for actual strikes
which is higher by 4 percentage points than that of last year.
</P>
<P>
The report said it only took 15 days for the NCMB to dispose a
strike, faster by 8 days than the 23 days needed to dispose a
strike during the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
If the trend continues, it will be the lowest level of strike
incidence in the history of labor-management relations in the
country, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The NCMB also said it has facilitated 2.6 billion pesos (65
million U.S. dollars) worth of wage and non-wage benefits
contained in collective bargaining agreement packages as a result
of the speedy resolution of labor disputes during the first
semester.
</P>
<P>
According to NCMB Executive Director Buenaventura Magsalin, the
2.6 billion pesos (65 million dollars) worth of packages benefited
6,443 workers.
</P>
<P>
"This amount was given and will be given to all covered
employees because we were able to jointly and speedily resolve the
labor disputes besetting their respective workplaces," Magsalin
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government had
announced new policy measures to restructure the economy for
achieving sustainable growth and creating more jobs, the Daily
Nation newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Finance Permanent Secretary Martin Oduor-Otieno Wednesday said
there would be substantial cuts in the domestic borrowing
requirements to contain the debt and lower interest rates.
</P>
<P>
Outlining the policies at the launch of a new book, Kenya's
Strategic Policies for the 21st Century, Oduor-Otieno admitted
that the country's economy was at its lowest ebb due to bad
governance, especially in public procurement.
</P>
<P>
He noted that all existing policies would be scrutinized to
strengthen those that are appropriate to fit in the recovery
strategies, discard unsuitable ones and create a supportive
environment to ensure they are implemented well.
</P>
<P>
The government plans to increase productivity in the
agricultural sector to create jobs to reduce the customs duty on
agricultural equipment and increase the duty on imported goods,
he added
</P>
<P>
The permanent secretary also announced that the government will
instill discipline and ethics in leadership in the coffee, tea and
milk sectors.
</P>
<P>
The public investment to focus on high priority projects that
have greater impact on economic growth and poverty alleviation
will also be instituted, Oduor-Otieno said.
</P>
<P>
On civil service reform, efforts will be concentrated on core
functions and remove duplication and functional overlaps, he
said, adding it will also require the down-sizing of staff and
re-allocation of non-core government functions to appropriate
organizations, including the private sector.
</P>
<P>
Oduor-Otieno stressed that economic governance will be
strengthened to remove opportunities for corruption.
</P>
<P>
In financial sector reform, the permanent secretary said the
government will put in place measures to reduce the level of
non-performing loans and bring down operational costs.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Stalls on SADC Trade Protocol </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government is still
reluctant to ratify the Southern Africa Development Community
(SADC) trade protocol.
</P>
<P>
This is because it wishes to ensure that the agreement will not
have a negative impact on the country's trade once signed, Times
of Zambia newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Commerce, Trade and Industry Minister David Mpamba disclosed in
an interview in Lusaka Wednesday that Zambia would sign the
agreement once institutional mechanisms that needed to be put in
place were finalized.
</P>
<P>
Mpamba said: "Trade ministers will meet to work out
institutional support for the SADC trade protocol to be
implemented. In fact only one country is remaining to sign before
we could ratify."
</P>
<P>
He said the government was not worried with the revenue that
would be lost because it would gain more from trade.
</P>
<P>
SADC early this year ratified four protocols in four sectors
and had asked its members to expedite its ratification of the
remaining five protocols.
</P>
<P>
The ratified were the protocols in transport and community,
energy, immunization and privileges, meteorology and shared water
courses.
</P>
<P>
The council of ministers also urged the members to ratify
without delay the protocols on trade, mining and tourism
development including one on fighting drug trafficking.

<HEADLINE> "Two States" Remarks Refuted by Fujian Residents (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"It is futile to block or destroy such cooperation and exchange,
" Sun continued. "The 'two states' statements will be strongly
opposed by the people on both sides of the straits, as the
statements totally go against the will of the people on both sides,
and against the best interests of the Taiwan people pursuing peace,
stability and progress."
</P>
<P>
The "two states" remarks by Lee Teng-hui are also unanimously
criticized by people of Meizhou Island, the hometown of Mazu,
known as goddess of the sea and worshipped by people across the
straits.
</P>
<P>
Local residents of Meizhou Island speak in great detail about
the inseparable connection between the people across the straits.
They also believe the reunification of the motherland is an
irreversible movement, and Lee Teng-hui's plot to split the
motherland is doomed to fail.
</P>
<P>
On the island of Taiwan, well over 1,000 temples are dedicated
to Mazu. There are 16 million Mazu followers in Taiwan, accounting
for 75 percent of the total population of the province.
</P>
<P>
In the first seven months of the year, 50,000 Taiwan
compatriots visited Meizhou Island, where the world's first Mazu
temple is preserved, said local sources.
</P>
<P>
A group of representatives from the province's sports community
also expressed indignation at Lee Teng-hui's "two states"
statement.
</P>
<P>
They told their personal experience to prove Taiwan is an
inseparable part of China, both sides of the straits belong to one
big family, and said that Lee's plot to split up the motherland is
unpopular.

<HEADLINE> Israel, PNA Agree on Wye Withdrawal Timetable </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Israeli and Palestinian
negotiators agreed Wednesday night on a timetable over
implementing the Wye agreement that would require Israel to
complete two further sets of West Bank withdrawals by January 20.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post Thursday quoted Palestinian and Israeli
officials as saying that during the negotiations, the Palestinian
side showed willingness to stretch out the period from the 12
weeks mandated in the Wye accord in return for Israel's readiness
to reconfigure the two withdrawals.
</P>
<P>
The first of the two withdrawals would occur in October, but
instead of being 5 percent in scope, it would be 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak also agreed to
move up the final Wye withdrawal from February 15 to January.
</P>
<P>
Under the Wye agreement signed by Israel and the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) last year, Israel would withdraw from 13
percent of the West Bank, in exchange for tougher measures
against terrorism by the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Former Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu suspended the
agreement last December after finishing the first withdrawal and
handing 2 percent of the West Bank to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Following another meeting on Wednesday between Israeli
negotiator Gilad Sher and his Palestinian counterpart Saeb Erekat,
the Palestinian official said the two sides were likely to
conclude their talks by the middle of next week.
</P>
<P>
"We can say we have an agreement on the time frame for the
withdrawals. The Israelis have come up with ideas concerning the
time frame that have been accepted by us," the official told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
The paper said there is a possibility that "a new Wye deal"
will be signed next week in Egypt in the presence of Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak and U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright.
</P>
<P>
The issue over the release of Palestinian prisoners in Israeli
jails is the last major obstacle in the current negotiations, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
Erekat, who was meant to travel to Washington for talks with
Albright this week, decided to cancel the trip and stay in the
region so as to continue trying to find a solution to the
disagreement.
</P>
<P>
A senior Palestinian official said that Arafat was to travel to
Washington on September 22 to meet with U.S. President Bill
Clinton, Albright, and other U.S. officials.
</P>
<P>
An Israeli source said that the trip was intended to keep the
momentum going, and also to convince Arafat to be more flexible
on the prisoner release and other issues.
</P>
<P>
Once there is agreement on the timetable for the
implementation of the Wye agreement, and once Israel has started
to implement the agreement, the PNA sees no problem in starting
final-status talks, a PNA source said.

WELLINGTON, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The New Zealand dollar kept
sinking Thursday to its lowest point this year, after the
country's trade figures revealed that imports are still

<P>
The currency plunged more than three-quarters of a cent to
0.5168 U.S. dollars Wednesday and kept sinking Thursday to 0.5150

Statistics New Zealand said in a media release that New

It is reported that the international credit rating agency
Standard and Poor's has the country on creditwatch negative.
</P>
<P>
"The possibility of a downgrade is clearly present," New
Zealand Reserve Bank Governor Don Brash was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, he said a downgrade has been fully or partially priced
in to the New Zealand dollar and interest rates.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Brash signalled the central bank would look at
raising its official cash rate later this year.

<HEADLINE> China's Yunnan Province Holds Business Fair in Macao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The provincial government of
Yunnan in southwest China unveiled a three-day investment, trade
and tourism fair at the Landmark Conference and Exhibition Center
of Macao on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The pictures, charts and video and audio materials on display
help Macao business people know more about Yunnan's economic
situation, investment environment and tourism development
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
"There are extensive potentials for economic, trade and tourism
cooperation between Macao and Yunnan," said Cui Zhitao, deputy
secretary-general of the Yunnan provincial government and head of
the Yunnan delegation.
</P>
<P>
Cui noted that Yunnan boasts abundant natural resources,
tourism resources and booming tobacco industry, while Macao has
thriving tourism, finance and real estate sectors.
</P>
<P>
"In this sense, the two places can complement each other and
they have great potentials for cooperation," he said.
</P>
<P>
Trade between Yunnan and Macao started in 1965 at about only 30,
000 U.S. dollars. By 1998, export and import trade volume reached
6.29 million U.S. dollars. The major exported goods from Yunnan
were cigarette, canned food, tea, tin, zinc and aluminum.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1998, Macao investors had started 31 projects in
Yunnan, which involved more than 32 million U.S. dollars of funds
from Macao. The main categories of investment were catering,
amusement and real estate trades.
</P>
<P>
Both Air Macao and the Yunnan Airlines have opened direct
flights between Macao and Yunnan's provincial capital city of
Kunming. In 1998, more than 11,000 Macao tourists visited Yunnan.

<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, August 26 (Xinhua) -- China has so far set up
educational cooperation programs with over 160 countries and
regions, said Zhang Xiuqin, an official in charge of exchange and
cooperation in the Ministry of Education.
</P>
<P>
She said that in the past two decades, as many as 320,000
Chinese have gone abroad for further study, with the majority in
the United States, Japan, Britain, France, Germany, Canada,
Australia, and Russia.
</P>
<P>
China will stick to its policy of encouraging overseas study.
It has also worked out specific regulations to protect legal
rights of the students overseas, Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, more foreign students have been coming to China. The
figure increased from some 1,200 in 1978 to 43,000 from 164
countries in 1998. In the last 20 years, a total of 260,000 have
arrived.
</P>
<P>
When China's reform policy was initiated in the late 1970s,
scholars usually were sent abroad to participate in research
programs or for international seminars. In 1998 alone, over 5,500
foreign scholars came to China for a total of 150 international
academic meetings.
</P>
<P>
In recent years cooperation with foreign enterprises has become
another way of education exchange. China now has study programs
with Bell Telephone Laboratories, United Technologies Corp. and
IBM of the United States, Japan's Casio Corp., and Canada's Sun
Life Assurance Corp.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that China is eager to establish schools, especially
in the field of higher education, degree programs, and
professional training with foreign educational institutions.
Currently there are 400 such schools in the country.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Petrochemical Reports Edged Growth in 1st Half </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The Shanghai Petrochemical
Company Limited, one of the largest of its kind in China,
announced here Thursday that it had an edged growth in sales and
profit in the first half of 1999.
</P>
<P>
Lu Yiping, chairman and president of the company, told a press
conference at the Hong Kong Island Shangri-LA that his company
achieved a turnover totaling 5.8 billion RMB yuan (700 million U.S.
dollars) in the first six months this year, an increase of 31.3
percent compared with the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
The company's total profit in the first half of 1999 rose up to
283 million yuan (34 million U.S. dollars), about 15 times that of
the same period last year, he said.
</P>
<P>
Lu attributed the rapid growth in sales to greater demand for
petrochemical products resulting from the recovery of Asia's
economy and China's petrochemical industry in the first half of
1999.
</P>
<P>
The effective measures taken by the Chinese government, such as
the crackdown on illegal imports, enforcement of import controls,
enhanced supervision over processing and increased industrial self-
discipline, were also attributable, he said.
</P>
<P>
In the second half this year, the company will further expand
its production, and the planned new projects include a new one-
million-ton delayed coking plant and a 25,000-ton hydrocarbon
resins plant, Lu said.
</P>
<P>
Located in Jinshanwei in the southwest of Shanghai, the company
is a highly integrated petrochemical complex with the main
products of synthetic fibers, plastics and various kinds of
petroleum products.

BEIJING, August 26 (Xinhua) -- A dog owned by a Beijing

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Not to Punish TV Station Over Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The Lebanese cabinet Wednesday
evening decided to spare the country's leading television network
LBCI from punishment after it covered a news conference featuring
Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy in Jordan.
</P>
<P>
After the weekly regular cabinet session, Lebanese Information
Minister Anwar Khalil told reporters that the council of
ministers called on all the audiovisual and print media to abide
by the existing laws, especially those related to the boycott of
Israel.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Lebanon's National Audiovisual Media Council
recommended that the country's most popular TV station be
suspended for three days and satellite transmission interrupted
for 24 hours as its film crew attended a news conference in Jordan
by the Israeli foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
But, the recommendations are not binding and need to be
endorsed by the country's information minister.
</P>
<P>
"The information minister was entrusted with relaying this
warning to the media and to oversee the strict implementation of
the law," Khalil added.
</P>
<P>
Although the program was not broadcast and the crew has since
been fired by LBCI, the media council still insisted that the
station deserve punishment, drawing angry retorts from Lebanese
politicians.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon is technically at war with Israel, which set up a
self-declared security zone in south Lebanon in 1985 to protect
its north from cross-border attacks by Lebanese guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese government forbids its citizens to make any
contact with the Jewish state. Otherwise, they will be punished
severely, including death sentence.

<HEADLINE> Drought Causes Drying Up of China's Third Largest River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Severe drought conditions have
caused the drying up of China's third largest river, the Huaihe,
the first interrupted flow recorded in 20 years.
</P>
<P>
According to the Anhui Provincial Flood Control Headquarters in
east China, the flow capacity of the river's mainstream was less
than 10 cu. m per second due to a lack of rainfall this summer.
</P>
<P>
During the flood season, which lasted from June 1 to August 17,
rainfall around the Huaihe River was 241 mm -- half the normal
level.
</P>
<P>
In the northern part of the river, rainfall was measured at 10
mm to 20 mm during the period, 70 percent less than in 1978, when
a severe drought hit the area.
</P>
<P>
The Huaihe, which covers an area of 270,000 sq. km., flows
through Henan, Anhui, Jiangsu and Shandong provinces,
</P>
<P>
In the past five decades, the river's flow was choked in 1979,
1978, 1966 and 1959, respectively, due to severe drought. In 1959,
the river stopped flowing for 90 days.
</P>
<P>
The Anhui provincial government has adopted measures, including
cloud-seeding, to alleviate the situation.

is the relation between state and state, which poses as a
challenge to the dignity and national pride of the Chinese people,
" Zhang said. "People on both sides of the straits will never
agree."
</P>
<P>
According to him, scientific exchange, and economic and trade
cooperation between Taiwan and Fujian Provinces in the field of
fishery have been increasing since the Chinese initiated reform
policies in 1978.
</P>
<P>
By 1998 Taiwan investors had started 261 businesses engaged in
aquatic products, with contracts involving 226 million U.S.
dollars of investment from Taiwan businessmen.
</P>
<P>
Zhao Jianpei, an aquatic product technology researcher and also
a member of Jiusan Society, one of the eight democratic parties in
China, said fishery exchange and cooperation across the straits
benefits both sides.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show Fujian Province provides Taiwan with 60,000
laborers for developing fishery; 40 percent of fish, shrimp and
prawn, shellfish and algae on the market of Taiwan come from the
Chinese mainland, while Taiwan investors bring in investment,
technology, management expertise, and improved varieties.
</P>
<P>
"Lee Teng-hui concocted the 'two states' statement, which
causes tension in the Taiwan Straits, so Lee is the mastermind who
is damaging the fishery exchange and cooperation across the
straits," he said.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Grant Amnesty to Regional Prisoners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Thailand will grant amnesty to
Southeast Asian prisoners to mark the king's 72nd birthday, the
Bangkok Post reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The amnesty, initiated by Thai Foreign Minister Surin Pitsuwan,
will take effect on December 5, the king's birthday.
</P>
<P>
Diplomats from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN) have been asked to submit their lists of inmates to be
included in the scheme by the first week of September. However,
the chance of release would depend on criteria being worked out by
the Correction Department.
</P>
<P>
Those convicted on serious charges might be excluded, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, about 25,000 inmates including 4,000 foreigners were
pardoned on the king's Golden Jubilee.
</P>
<P>
The Thai Foreign Ministry and agencies concerned are finalizing
the exact figure of ASEAN prisoners in Thai jails. Most of them
are serving time on non-criminal charges including illegal entry,
over-staying and counterfeiting official documents.
</P>
<P>
The ministry, meanwhile, is pushing for an agreement with other
ASEAN members on prisoner transfers so as to allow ASEAN inmates
to serve their remaining terms in their home countries.
</P>
<P>
So far, Thailand still has no such agreements with any of the
other ASEAN members -- Brunei, Burma, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos,
Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Later, the ministry would also push for similar agreements with
non-ASEAN countries, especially in the West.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Adopts First Resolution to Protect Children in War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
on Wednesday unanimously adopted an unprecedented resolution to
protect children during armed conflicts.
</P>
<P>
The resolution, adopted at the end of an open debate, is the
first in the history of the Security Council to focus exclusively
on children facing armed conflicts.
</P>
<P>
In the resolution, the Security Council expressed its grave
concern at the harmful and widespread impact of conflict on
children and its long-term consequences for peace, security and
development.
</P>
<P>
"The Security Council strongly condemned the targeting of
children during armed conflicts, including killing and maiming,
sexual violence, abduction and forced displacement, recruitment
and use of children in violation of international laws," said the
resolution.
</P>
<P>
The resolution urged all parties engaged in armed conflicts to
consider the protection, welfare and rights of children during
peace negotiations and the process of consolidating peace in the
aftermath of conflict.
</P>
<P>
It also called on measures to be implemented and respected
during armed conflicts to minimize the harm suffered by children,
such as "days of tranquillity" to allow the delivery of basic
necessary services.
</P>
<P>
In particular, the resolution demanded that special measures be
taken to protect girls from any forms of sexual abuse and gender-
based violence during conflicts. In addition, the special needs of
girls should be of concern during and after conflicts, and in the
delivery of humanitarian assistance.
</P>
<P>
The resolution meanwhile urged efforts to ensure an end to the
recruitment and use of children in armed conflict in violation of
international law.
</P>
<P>
More than 300,000 children under 18 years of age are serving as
child soldiers in armed conflicts worldwide. In most of the world'
s conflicts, children under 15, and even as young as seven, have
been reported to be taking part.
</P>
<P>
Over the last decade, 2 million children were killed, 1 million
orphaned, 6 million seriously injured or disabled and 12 million
made homeless because of war.

<HEADLINE> Major U.S. Banks Raise Key Lending Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Several major banks in the
United States on Wednesday raised the key lending rate by a
quarter of one percent in response to a Federal Reserve interest
rate hike Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Chase Manhattan Corp., Citibank, Fleet Financial Group Inc. and
BankBoston Corp. all announced the increase in the prime rate, by
which banks charge their best corporate borrowers. The increase,
which sends the rate to 8.25 percent from the original 8 percent,
took effect immediately.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, U.S. banks like Wells Fargo, Bank of
America and Bank One had already raised their prime lending rate
to 8.25 percent from 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
The rate hikes follow a Federal Reserve decision Tuesday to
increase two major interest rates -- the federal funds rate from 5
percent to 5.25 percent, and the discount rate from 4.5 percent to
4.75 percent. This decision was made to stave off inflation.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say the cost of mortgages, credit cards and other
loans will rise as a result, slightly bolstering profits for the
banks even if consumers borrow less.
</P>
<P>
They add that banks can create a profit window by jacking up
lending rates immediately and delaying an increase in deposit
rates.
</P>
<P>
However, some analysts worry that with higher interest rates,
lending volume will dwindle and the banks' own borrowing costs
will rise, thus hampering profit growth.
</P>
<P>
"The profit equation doesn't change much but growth trends tend
to decline," said Stephen Biggar, an analyst at S&AMP;P Equity Group.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Former President George Bush Optimistic About Ties With China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Former U.S. president George
Bush has said he is optimistic about U.S.-China relations despite
"serious setbacks" that occurred during the past year.
</P>
<P>
"I am still an optimist even given the difficulties in
relations between our two countries that have cropped up in the
last year," Bush said in a recent written interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
"The reason for my optimism is that U.S. leaders and Chinese
leaders seem to see clearly that good relations which serve our
respective national interests are in the best interest of world
peace and of prosperity for the people in both the U.S. and China,
" he said.
</P>
<P>
Bush, who worked in China from 1974 to 1975 as head of the U.S.
Liaison Office in Beijing, told Xinhua that he and his wife
Barbara consider themselves "true friends of China," and they "do
worry...when things get difficult between our two great countries.
"
</P>
<P>
Sino-U.S. relations suffered a hard blow after the U.S.-led
NATO bombed the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade last May, killing
three Chinese journalists and wounding a dozen diplomats. The ties
went even more sour as the House later released the Cox report
that alleged nuclear espionage by Beijing, fanning up an anti-
China hysteria in the U.S. media.
</P>
<P>
About Lee Teng-hui's "state-to-state" fallacy released on July
9, which raised tensions across the Taiwan Strait, Bush said: "I
believe the U.S. should not veer from either the spirit or the
letter of the Shanghai Communique and other legal commitments made.
"
</P>
<P>
In the Shanghai Communique, signed by the two sides when former
U.S. President Richard Nixon visited China in 1972, the United
States acknowledges that "all Chinese on either side of the Taiwan
Strait maintain there is but one China and that Taiwan is a part
of China."
</P>
<P>
"I still feel this matter can best be negotiated by Chinese on
both sides of the Strait without outside interference," he added.
</P>
<P>
The former president also called for progress on China's access
to the World Trade Organization (WTO). "I want to see China in the
WTO as soon as possible, and I understand that the U.S. and China
already are in substantial agreement on the substantive terms of
China's entry," he said.
</P>
<P>
Bush also wants to see "fewer barriers to trade" and China's
acceptance of "more foreign investment in a wider range of fields.
"
</P>
<P>
Bush applauded the "tremendous progress" China has made since
the country initiated its policy of reform and opening to the
outside world in the late 70's.
</P>
<P>
He urged more Americans to visit China so that they could see
for themselves "the dramatic progress that has been made."
</P>
<P>
Bush wished the Chinese people "good luck" in their celebration
of the 50th anniversary of the People's Republic and the 20th
anniversary salute to openness and reform.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Plans 5 Percent Budget Deficit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government plans a
budget deficit of five percent of gross domestic products (GDP)
for the 1999-2000 fiscal year, starting from October 1 this year,
the Bangkok Post Thursday quoted the Finance Ministry as saying.
</P>
<P>
The deficit is aimed at helping maintain stimulus programs for
the economy, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The government had originally projected a deficit of six
percent of GDP, or about 300 billion baht (8.1 billion U.S.
dollars), for the current fiscal year, which ends next month.
</P>
<P>
The declining deficit is based on projections of increased tax
revenue as the economy improves.
</P>
<P>
The 2000 budget projects expenditure of 860 billion baht (23.2
billion dollars), an increase of 4.2 percent on this year.
</P>
<P>
The deficit includes a three-percent target for the central
budget and two percent for state enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Finance Ministry officials said budget targets for next year
would be more flexible than in the past, adjusting in line with
the economy's condition.

<HEADLINE> Slum Dwellers in Dhaka Slum Asked to "Get Lost" Within 7 Days </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Despite a High Court order not to
evict slum dwellers without arrangement for their rehabilitation,
residents at the BNP bustee (slum) in the capital city's Agargaon
area have been asked by police to "get lost" within seven days.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was blared through loudspeakers late Tuesday
night and early Wednesday morning, slum residents were quoted as
saying, press reports said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"They have been given a week's time to leave," Additional
Deputy Commissioner of Dhaka Metropolitan Police (West) Ibrahim
Fatmi said Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
The sprawling shantytown accommodates as many as 80,000 people
over a large area designated for different government offices, the
reports said.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Kamal Hossain, who was advocating against the on-going
government move to evict city slum dwellers without arrangement
for their rehabilitation, said the police announcement was a clear
case of contempt of court. He added that in its judgment on Monday
the High Court clearly indicated that no eviction of slum dwellers
could be evicted without arrangement for their rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
Some people had left the slum, while many others were getting
ready to resist any move to evict them.
</P>
<P>
The BNP Bazar slum is divided into 26 clusters and each one has
been named after the man who owns and controls his respective
cluster. There are more than 17,000 registered voters in the slum,
residents said.
</P>
<P>
While disposing of a writ petition which challenged the
eviction of slums without alternative accommodation and without
any prior notice, a High Court Division of the Supreme Court on
Monday vacated the "stay" order it issued earlier on eviction of
slums, and said that the slums should be removed from the city in
phases under a rehabilitation program by the government.
</P>
<P>
"It has to be done phase by phase otherwise the demolition of
slums may not solve the problems," it said.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 70,000 people were evicted from the slums in the capital
city early this month by law-enforcing agencies, following the
killing of a police constable. The government launched the
eviction drive on the ground that the slums had become dens of
terrorists and criminals.
</P>
<P>
The High Court later directed the government not to remove any
more slums in the capital city until the court resumed hearing of
the writ petition, filed by non-governmental organizations and
slum dwellers.
</P>
<P>
It was said there are about 2 million slum dwellers in the
Bangladeshi capital, home for some 9 million people.

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Float 500-million-U.S.-Dollar Global Bond </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government will
float 500 million U.S. dollars worth of bonds this year to cover
the higher budget gap and help ward off mounting pressure on
interest rates, Malaya newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The paper said the new bond issue will have a maturity of 25
years, the longest allowed by the country's law.
</P>
<P>
Edgardo Espiritu, secretary of the Finance Department, was
quoted by the paper as saying that the bonds would be launched
sometime in September for pricing before the year ends.
</P>
<P>
Espiritu said the proceeds of the funds would be primarily used
for the moderate pump-priming next year.
</P>
<P>
But he stressed that if the funds allotted for this year's
budget support would be insufficient, the government might draw
from the proceeds of the bonds to cover the excess in expenditures
this year.
</P>
<P>
The global bond issuance is among the three schemes of raising
funds abroad being contemplated by the government to cover the
budget deficit for next year.
</P>
<P>
The other two are the 500-million-dollar asset-backed
securities and the one-billion-dollar samurai bond with the credit
enhancement of the Miyazawa initiative.

<HEADLINE> East China Provinces Combat Pine Tree Disease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Four provinces in east China
recently initiated a 59-million yuan (about 7.1 million U.S.
dollars) project aimed at combating nematodiasis, a plant disease
endangering pine trees in the area.
</P>
<P>
The project covers 3.48 million hectares of pine forest in
Anhui, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, and Shandong provinces and will be
completed within five years.
</P>
<P>
The disease, which was first carried into China by long-horned
beetles in 1982, has plagued 51,730 hectares of pine trees in
these provinces.
</P>
<P>
No other effective measures have been found so far in the world
to deal with the disease, also called "cancer of pine trees", but
felling all trees that had been plagued by nematodiasis.
</P>
<P>
Experts have warned that 6.67 million hectares will be
destroyed and the ecological environment at the middle and lower
reaches of the Yangtze River and the valleys of Taihu Lake and
Fuchunjiang River damaged unless effective measures are taken to
curb the spread of the disease.
</P>
<P>
Scenic spots such as West Lake in Hangzhou in Zhejiang Province,
and Huangshan Mountain in Anhui Province will also be threatened.
</P>
<P>
It has been learned that the four provinces will use pesticides
to trap and kill beetles, or protect old and well-known trees by
injecting pesticides into the trunk of the trees.
</P>
<P>
Other kinds of trees will be planted around hard-hit areas to
form a natural shelter belt to prevent the disease from spreading.
</P>
<P>
With the completion of the project, nematodiasis-striken area
will be cut by half. The rate of trees killed and plagued by the
disease will be under 0.1 percent.

<HEADLINE> Bird's Nests Racket Thrives in Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The illegal bird's nests export
is thriving in Sri Lanka and has reached alarming levels, an
environmental group said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Society for Environment Education said they
have bared a racket involving large scale smuggling of bird's
nests to Southeast Asian and Far East countries where bird's
nest-soup is a culinary delicacy believed to contain aphrodisiac
properties.
</P>
<P>
The increasing demand for the soup and the continuous
interference and disturbances in the bird breeding pattern have
resulted in the trade collapsing in Malaysia and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
This has led to buyers moving into other countries including
Sri Lanka to continue their trade, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
A kilogram of bird's nests is purchased in Sri Lanka by illegal
exporters at anything between 150 to 450 U.S. dollars while
overseas the nests fetch around 2,500 dollars a kilogram, said the
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
"This so called aphrodisiac craze coupled with lucrativeness of
the trade are pressuring bird population to alarming levels," he
said.
</P>
<P>
In Sri Lanka, the nests are mainly brought to Colombo and
Ratnapura, the Gem City where Thai gem merchants use it as an
aphrodisiac. A significant quantity is also exported to Singapore
and the Far East.
</P>
<P>
"The trade or collection of the nests is banned in Sri Lanka
under the Flora and Fauna Ordinance. The edible nest of the swift,
as the bird is called, is a protected species. Therefore, it is an
offense to kill, capture or collect or even be in possession of
these nests or birds," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
He cautioned that if adequate steps are not taken to stop the
bird's nests racket, these unique species will undoubtedly become
extinct in the near future.

<HEADLINE> Moroccan Plane Hijacking Over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The hijacker of a Moroccan plane
surrendered in Barcelona, Spain, early Thursday, bringing a
peaceful end to the hijacking, the Spanish TV reported.
</P>
<P>
"The hijacking is over," said Spanish Interior Ministry
Spokesman Eduardo Planells. Police were checking to see if there
were any other hijackers trying to hide among the passengers, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Passengers could be seen leaving the plane and getting on two
waiting buses.
</P>
<P>
The nationality of the surrendered hijacker was still unknown,
Planells said.
</P>
<P>
The plane, which belongs to the Moroccan Royal Air Maroc, was
hijacked by a French-speaking man during the flight from
Casablanca to Tunis late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The airliner, with 79 passengers and nine crew members aboard,
was later forced to land in Barcelona. The hijacker had demanded
fuel to carry the flight on to Frankfurt, Germany.

<HEADLINE> A Russian's Experience In Xinjiang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Zhang Yuxia is the Chinese name
of a Russian teacher who has lived in northwest China's Xinjiang
Uygur Autonomous Region for 61 years delving into a precious
Chinese medicine called the snow lotus.
</P>
<P>
She retired from Xinjiang Agricultural University ten years ago,
but hasn't stopped her research for a single day. Her efforts have
paid off -- and she has taken the lead in China in the artificial
cultivation of the snow lotus.
</P>
<P>
Despite her age, Zhang at 70 still hopes to turn her research
results into wealth for other people.
</P>
<P>
Local people have forgotten Zhang's Russian name and just call
her Teacher Zhang.
</P>
<P>
She is just one of more than 10,000 people of Russian
nationality who are now in Xinjiang. The Russian is one of the 55
ethnic minorities in China.
</P>
<P>
In the 1930s, many Russians began to teach driving and
automobile repairs in Xinjiang; Russian technicians also helped to
breed excellent varieties of livestock after 1949 when the People'
s Republic of China was founded.
</P>
<P>
An increasing number of Russians now have shifted their jobs
from transportation, handicrafts, and agriculture to such high-
tech industries as medicines and finance and securities, local
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
Zhang's father was a carpenter and the family was very poor
when it settled down in Xinjiang in 1938.
</P>
<P>
In the 1950s, the local government helped Zhang to enter
Xinjiang Agricultural University and she remained there to teach
after graduation. Zhang was a member of the Regional Committee of
the Political Consultative Conference from 1982 to 1998.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that the daily lives and work of the Russians in
Xinjiang have been absolutely integrated into those of the whole
Chinese society.

</P>
<P>
The presidents said in the joint statement that the five
countries should make joint efforts to fight against national
separatism, religious extremism and cross-national crimes in the
region.
</P>
<P>
They also called on early construction of air, rail and highway
transportation facilities in the region so as to enlarge regional
economic development for a common prosperity.

<HEADLINE> China Cracks down on Shoddy Construction Materials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The State Quality and Technical
Supervision Administration is committed to cracking down on the
use of shoddy construction materials that jeopardize safety,
according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper cited sources from the administration as saying
that during a three-month nationwide inspection that wound up last
month, quality inspectors seized more than 1.2 billion yuan (145
million US dollars) worth of fake and shoddy construction
materials.
</P>
<P>
The inspection covered such products as cement, reinforced
steel, paint, decoration materials and fire-fighting equipment
collected from more than 54,000 stores and markets.
</P>
<P>
To the dissatisfaction of the inspectors, fewer than 65 percent
of all products could meet State standards, and decoration
materials that met State levels made up only 58.7 percent of the
total.
</P>
<P>
Inspectors also closely examined materials used at nearly 16,
000 construction sites. They were shocked to find that substandard
products were being used at more than 3,600 sites, almost one
quarter of the total. Moreover, a large number of manufacturers
were found to be without production licenses.
</P>
<P>
During the inspection, quality officials punished more than 20,
000 stores and markets selling fake and substandard products. They
traced and cracked down on 720 manufacturing plants of such
products, in a bid to force inferior construction materials out of
the market.

<HEADLINE> Underwater Cable to Link Some American Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, August 24 (Xinhua) -- An underwater optical fiber
cable linking seven American countries and regions will be placed
in Costa Rican waters Monday, the Costa Rican Electricity
Institute (ICE) said Wednesday in a bulletin.
</P>
<P>
The Maya-1 underwater cable will start in Florida, the United
States, and end in Tolu, Colombia, while passing through Cancun in
Mexico, Grand Cayman in the Cayman Islands, Puerto Cortes in
Honduras, Puerto Limon in Costa Rica, and Colon in Panama. The
cable will reach a total distance of 4,400 kilometers, the
bulletin said.
</P>
<P>
ICE said an international consortium of 39 telecommunications
companies are participating in the project. The cost of the
project, which is scheduled to commence operations in July 2000,
is 207 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
It will take one week to lay the cable in Costa Rican
territorial waters, said the bulletin.
</P>
<P>
ICE believes the cable, the first of its kind in Costa Rica,
will permit it to offer its clients direct links to the United
States, Central and South America, and eventually the whole world.
</P>
<P>
Direct communication through optical fiber has a high degree of
quality and dependability in international telecommunications.
Optical fiber cable also provides enough capacity and band-width
for the development of information communications such as video
conferences, Internet, multimedia, virtual networks, and Intranet.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN School Swimming Championships End </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 26 (Xinhua) -- The fourth ASEAN (Association of
Southeast Asian Nations) School Swimming Championships was
concluded in Jakarta on Wednesday with Indonesia managing to
accomplish their ambition of winning the championship trophy.
</P>
<P>
After seeing hope fading following the first day's display --
which saw Thailand take the provisional lead unchallenged -- the
home team bounced back over the next two days to turn the tables,
completing the tournament as the overall winners.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's fine performance ends Thailand's domination in the
region, where the Thai swimmers have won the trophy three times in
a row.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia pocketed a total of 12 golds while Thailand came a
close second with 11.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia came out as the third place holder, after bagging six
golds, followed by Vietnam in fourth place, leaving medal-less
Brunei on the bottom.
</P>
<P>
The three-day championship aims to serve as a talent spotting
arena for the region.
</P>
<P>
"Through the fourth ASEAN School Swimming Championships, we
strengthen the unity, spirit and honour of ASEAN countries" was
the motto of this year's fixture.
</P>
<P>
The chairman of the organizing committee Sri Sudono Sumarto
said the result was extraordinary because it was Indonesia's first
overall championship title since it began competing in the event
in 1993.
</P>
<P>
"We did the right thing by proposing Jakarta to host the event
in a meeting in Subic, the Philippines. We said Indonesia had few
swimming competitions. We did not know that the country would be
hit by the economic crisis the following year, but look at the
results now. The swimmers were motivated by their last
performances in the SEA (Southeast Asian) Games in Brunei, and
also the support of the spectators," he was quoted by national
newspapers Thursday as saying.

<HEADLINE> China To Build Museum For Tang Dynasty Frescos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, August 26 (Xinhua) -- China plans to build a museum to
display frescos that were unearthed from Tang Dynasty (618-907)
tombs in this capital of northwest China's Shaanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
The 3,000-sq.m. museum will be added to the provincial history
museum, according to Zhou Tianyou, the curator of the history
museum, which has a collection of 540 rare frescos, most of which
came from tombs of the Tang Dynasty.
</P>
<P>
The frescos are among the most remarkable artworks of the
Chinese dynasties, Zhou says, and were the works of famous
painters. One of them depicting a maid-in-waiting, which was
discovered in the tomb of a princess, is regarded as an
outstanding work of art.
</P>
<P>
Many of the frescos portray hunting scenes and ceremonies and
show the magnificence of imperial life and provide clues to
ancient politics, the economy, the military, and the culture.
</P>
<P>
The museum will be built at a cost of 50 million yuan (about
six million U.S. dollars). Construction work on the museum will be
completed next October and it will be open to public in early 2001.

Toronto, Seles fought off Russia's Elena Likhovtseva 6-0, 7-6 (8-6)
today to reach the quarter-finals of the Pilot Pen hardcourt
tournament.

WASHINGTON, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Sean Elliott, a star member
of the NBA championship winning team San Antonio, was released
from a hospital Wednesday, nine days after a kisney transplant
operation in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
The 31-year-old veteran forward smiled and waved to a few fans
when he left Methodist Specialty and Transplant Hospital.
</P>
<P>
Elliot offered a lunch for nurses involved in his operation
yesterday and signed autographs for hospital workers today. "It is
happy to be going home," he said.
</P>
<P>
The 10-year player underwent the operation on August 16,
receiving a kidney from his elder brother Noel, a 32-year-old
sales associate.
</P>
<P>
Noel pushed Sean Elliott out of the hospital in a wheelchair
todya's afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Sean needed the transplant because of a condition known as
focal segmental glomerular sclerosis.
</P>
<P>
Another brief surgery was required Saturday to make sure
Elliott's new kidney was properly connected and working.
</P>
<P>
Now Elliott will embark on months of recuperation that probably
will determine whether he will play again in the NBA.

VIENNA, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Chief of General Staff of the
Bosnian Serb Army Momir Talic was arrested by Vienna police on
Wednesday and was sent to the International Criminal Tribunal for
Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in The Hague later.
</P>
<P>
The Austrian Foreign Ministry confirmed in a press release that
Austrian police secretly arrested Talic under the order of the

Talic was in Vienna for a military conference on the Bosnia

for Bosnia war-era crimes against humanity by the ICTY.
</P>
<P>
According to news from Belgrade, Bosnian Serb Deputy Prime
Minister Mirko Sharovich released a statement on the same day,
saying Austria's action of arresting Talic was an insult to all
the Bosnian Serbs and the Bosnian Serb Republic.

</P>
<P>
He said around 50 businessmen will accompany Ecuadorian

"We will invite Chinese industrialists to come and invest in
the country. We are taking with us about 30 investment projects
that go from trout raising to basil cultivation," said Del Campo.
</P>
<P>
"The idea is to seek alliances or joint investment between
Ecuadorian and Chinese entrepreneurs," he said.
</P>
<P>
The balance of trade favored China in 1998, because of the

<P>
LOS ANGELES, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of firefighters
are battling hundreds of fires that have burned more than 40,000
acres of land in California and Nevada, the United States.
</P>
<P>
Officials at California's Stanislaus National Forest, about 200
kilometers east of San Francisco, said a major fire near the town
of Groveland has burned 2,000 acres and only 40 percent of the
blaze has been contained as of Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
With other fires burning in northeastern California, a total of
about 30,000 acres have been scorched as the state neared the peak
of its annual fire season, an official from the California
Department of Forestry said.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,000 firefighters are battling the blazes,
reportedly ignited as a result of lightning, said John Hawkins, a
spokesman for the department.
</P>
<P>
In neighboring Nevada, thousands of acres of dry desert scrub
were ablaze in the north of Reno, forcing the evacuation Tuesday
of 60 ranches and the creation of an emergency rescue convoy to
save tigers, bobcats, bears and snow leopards from an animal
shelter in the path of the flames, a local official said.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Manchester United opened a three
point lead at the top of the premier league with a 2-1 victory at
Coventry City on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
But it was a disastrous night for Newcastle United who threw
away a lead to lose 2-1 at home to arch-rivals Sunderland.
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere Arsenal cruised to a 2-0 home victory over Bradford
City, Everton made it eight goals in two games with a 4-0
thrashing of Wimbledon while bottom club Sheffield Wednesday lost
2-0 at home to Derby County.
</P>
<P>
United now have 13 points from five games, three clear of Aston
Villa and Arsenal.
</P>
<P>
Sheffield Wednesday and Newcastle are now the only teams
without a win and prop up the table with a point apiece.
</P>
<P>
Manchester United dominated at Highfield Road but could not
break through in the first half against a hard-working Coventry.
</P>
<P>
It took the introduction of substitute Paul Scholes to change
things. He had only just entered the fray when Dwight Yorke found
him with a clever flick and the striker fired in from the edge of
the box in the 63rd minute.
</P>
<P>
It was all United from then on and an unmarked Yorke headed the
second from a pinpoint David Beckham cross 12 minutes later.
</P>
<P>
John Aloisi pulled one back for Coventry to set up a tense
finish but the champions held on for a deserved three points.
</P>
<P>
At the other end of the managerial spectrum is Ruud Gullit,
whose future at Newcastle is likely to be a short one after defeat
to the club's biggest rivals.
</P>
<P>
Gullit left Alan Shearer on the bench in a controversial move
with the two men apparently at loggerheads after Newcastle's dire
start to the season.
</P>
<P>
Things picked up briefly when Kieron Dyer finished off a lovely
move in the 28th minute to put Newcastle ahead.
</P>
<P>
But Sunderland's Niall Quinn flicked in a near post header in
the 64th minute for a deserved equaliser.
</P>
<P>
Torrential rain made the pitch almost unplayable in the latter
stages but Sunderland's Kevin Phillips added another winning goal
15 minutes from time.
</P>
<P>
Newcastle will visit Manchester United on Saturday.

LONDON, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Italian side Parma managed a 1-0
win over Scottish champions Rangers on Wednesday night but still
failed to this season's European Champions League.
</P>

Turkey side Galatasaray cheered up the suffering country which

Galatasaray swapped their usual red and yellow strip for a
mainly black kit and both teams wore black arm-bands and held a
minute's silence before the kick-off to remember the thousands
killed in the disaster. Okan Buruk headed the only goal after 52
minutes.
</P>
<P>
Former European champions Borussia Dortmund and PSV Eindhoven
also clinched their places with home wins over Teplice of the

Borussia won 1-0 for a 2-0 aggregate win, while PSV needed two

<P>
Elsewhere Slovenian outfit Maribor Teatanic upset Olympique
Lyon of France 3-0 on aggregate after a 2-0 second leg victory.
There was also an upset in Mallorca where Real Mallorca, beaten in

cities of Xinyang, Zhumadian and Nanyang were down as much as 90
percent. There was less than five cm. of precipitation in July.
</P>
<P>
The average rainfall in Henan was below 2.4 cm this month and
water in most reservoirs was down 20 percent to about 2.8 billion
cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
About 1.55 million people and 540,000 head of livestock have
been affected by the drought and are having difficulties getting
drinking water.
</P>
<P>
The lack of precipitation and higher temperatures this summer
have exacerbated the crop problem and about 2.1 million hectares
of farmland have been affected.
</P>
<P>
The province has launched a vigorous campaign to fight against
the devastating drought, in which more than six million people
have been mobilized. Provincial sources said that efforts have
been made to provide clean drinking water to the drought-plagued
people.

BONN -- Under protests of unions and party left-wingers,

Schroeder Wednesday at its session in Berlin officially approved a
sweeping fiscal reform package to become draft law.

The draft, raised by Finance Minister Hans Eichel and backed by
Schroeder, will mean to cut Germany's federal budget by 30.4
billion marks in the year 2000 and more in the next years. Pension,
jobless relief, public health and other social welfare paying will
be strictly limited to grow with the inflation rate under the
package. (Germany-Fiscal Reform)

<HEADLINE> Brazil to Mediate Only at Colombia's Request </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Brazil has no desire to mediate
in the Colombian peace process unless the Colombian government
makes an explicit request, Brazilian Foreign Minister Luiz Felipe
Lampreia said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
At a hearing in the Senate Foreign Affairs Commission, Lampreia
said Colombia is a democratic sovereign country despite its
economic problems, so Brazil is not preparing any intervention
plan.
</P>
<P>
He noted that it is essential to give the Colombian government
enough elbow room to conclude the peace process.
</P>
<P>
He said Brazil believes that no intervention or any other
external actions can resolve Colombia's problems. Besides, he said,
no nation is responsible for the Colombian war against drug
trafficking. The peace process of that country is the
responsibility of the Colombians themselves.
</P>
<P>
He said that if the problems were Brazil's, neither would
Brazilians permit any other country to threaten their sovereignty.

<HEADLINE> Costa Rica on Dengue Alert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Costa Rican health authorities
warned on Wednesday that the dengue disease could break out at
Puntarenas port on the Pacific coast, some 90 kilometers from the
country's capital.
</P>
<P>
"It is not an epidemic yet," said Carlos Valverde, member of a
special mission from the Monsenor Sanabria Hospital in Puntarenas.
</P>
<P>
The new outbreak must be stopped before it becomes an epidemic
that could threaten more than 200,000 people, said Dr. Valverde.
</P>
<P>
Three persons have so far been hospitalized and a fourth person
with hemorrhagic dengue has been taken to San Jose.
</P>
<P>
Dengue is an endemic disease in the region transmitted by the
Aedes aegypti mosquito that reproduces in water deposited on junk
and trash cavities and in old tires, especially during the rainy
season.
</P>
<P>
Dengue causes high fever, strong headache and body pain to
patients. In a typical case, its symptoms disappear in a week, but
the variety of hemorrhagic dengue is fatal if it is not treated in
time.

<HEADLINE> Storms "Dennis" and "Emily" Roam Caribbean Sea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Meteorologists are
closely watching tropical storms "Dennis" and "Emily," which are
currently situated in the Caribbean Sea, for signs of possible
evolution to more serious levels, a Colombian research center said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Institute of Hydrology, Meteorology and Environmental
Studies (IDEAM) released information describing the current
features of the two storms and ruled out threats to the Colombian
coast and island territory.
</P>
<P>
It said "Dennis" is a full-scale tropical storm with winds at
75 kilometers per hour. It is currently affecting the southern
Bahamas archipelago and moving toward the eastern U.S. coast.
</P>
<P>
"Emily" is still a small storm that is not threatening any
country of the region but could reach the north of the Minor
Antilles within the next 48 hours.
</P>
<P>
The IDEAM said it would continue monitoring the evolution of
the storms although they pose no threats to Colombia.

<HEADLINE> Jones's Quest Ends, Jackson Wins Back His Crown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEVILLE, August 25 (Xinhua) -- American sprinter Marion Jones
had her dream for an unprecedented sprint doubles ended in a
nightmare as she collapsed dramatically on the track during the
second semi-final of the 200 meters at the World Athletics
Championships Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
After running a reasonable bend, Jones seemed to lack her usual
zip in the home straight and was in fourth place when she grimaced,
clutched her lower back and fell to the ground. The Ameircan star
runner was rushed out to the medical centre inside the stadium and
attended by two doctors.
</P>
<P>
Her husband C.J. Hunter, shotput champion at Seville who was
watching in the stands, dashed down and accompanied Jones in front
of the stretcher.
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, the analysis revealed that the injury was not as
severe as initially feared. According to a statement from USA
Track and Field: "Jones experienced spasms and cramping in her
lower back. She is currently undergoing treatment and further
examination to determine the full extent of her condition."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Colin Jackson of Britain, throughout his long and
distinguished career, has been famous for his body-doubling dip
finish.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday night, the 32 year-old Welshman found the finish of
his life to secure his second world title - six years after he was
first crowned in Stuttgart. Jackson clocked 13.04 - but he had
been pushed all the way by Cuba's Anier Garcia (13.07) and Duane
Ross of the United States (13.12).
</P>
<P>
All three were evenly matched until the last stride when
Jackson, his teeth clenched, thrust himself at the finish line. At
first, he refused to believe the announcer and crouched motionless
on the track. Only when he saw the replay did he begin what would
be an emotional victory lap.
</P>
<P>
Jackson had vowed to win the title in honour of his close
friend Ross Baillie, who died earlier this year, and as he made
his way round the track, his face was stained with tears.
</P>
<P>
"It is superb to have succeeded again after so long. It was a
dramatic race for me and I knew it was vital to get out of the
blocks well and keep my cool. The key to my race was to relax."
</P>
<P>
History was on the verge of repeating itself in the women's
400m hurdles final. As in Athens in 1997, Nezha Bidouane seemed to
have timed her late surge to perfection, overtaking the race
leader as she collided with the final barrier. But the result
would not be the same and - by the narrowest of margins 52.89 to
52.90 - Bidouane would lose her title to Cuba's Daimi Pernia.
</P>
<P>
Olympic champion Deon Hemmings of Jamaica finished third at 53.
16.
</P>
<P>
In women's shotput, German Astrid Kumbernuss - after taking a
year's maternity leave - proved her strength by winning with a
modest 19.85 meters, her third consecutive world title.
</P>
<P>
Kumbernuss's German team-mate Nadine Kleinert set a personal
best of 19.61 to win silver. Russian Svetlana Krivelyobva had the
bronze at 19.43
</P>
<P>
At the World Championships in Gothenburg four years ago,
Jonathan Edwards had stunned the world with two gravity defying
world records. But Edwards seems to have lost the joyful
enthusiasm with which he delighted the crowds then. Unsmiling and
wrestling with his technique, Edwards could only achieve 17.48 for
a bronze in Seville Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
With the defending world champion Yoelbi Quesada also
struggling, Germany's Charles Friedek had the gold at 17.59 meters,
which he achieved at the fifth round attempt.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria's Rotislav Dimitrov secured silver with 17.49.
</P>
<P>
Two months after setting a world record of 8994 points, Tomas
Dvorak of the Czech Republic confirmed his status as the world's
greatest decathlete by winning his second successive world crown
with 8744 points. Among his leading performances were a 7.98 long
jump, 13.75 in the 110m hurdles and 70.11 in the javelin.
</P>
<P>
The big surprise came from 21 year-old Briton Dean Macey who
was in third place with just the 1500m to complete but after a
great run he secured the silver with 8556, a lifetime best.
</P>
<P>
America's Chris Huffins finished third with 8547 points.
</P>
<P>
Russian Germany Skurygin won the day's first gold medal when he
over walked a group of 50 walkers to win the men's 50km walk at
three hours 44 minutes and 23 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Italia's 22-year-old Ivano Brugnetti had the silver at 3:4:54
with another Russian Nikolay Matyukhin bronze at 3:48:18.
</P>
<P>
Pre-race favorite Robert Korzeniewski, defending champion and
Olympic gold medalist, fell from grace when he was disqualified at
the 38km point.

SEVILLE, August 25 (Xinhua) -- World 100 meters champion Marion
Jones of the United States is likely to miss the rest of the world

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 26 (Xinhua) -- Three to five thousand
security force members from the military, police and intelligence
services will be deployed daily during the All Africa Games.
</P>
<P>
Police spokesman for the joint operational and intelligence
structure, uperintendent Martin Aylward, said the majority would
start on September 1, when the first athletes are expected to
arrive.
</P>
<P>

<P>
Plans were being implemented to safeguard hotels, practice and

"We are in the process of implementing our security
arrangements and refining our planning," he said.

Aylward said security forces would also be on duty at border
posts and airports where participants and other VIPs will be
arriving.

<HEADLINE> Hackers Offered Award to Crack Email System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 25 (Xinhua) -- A London-based Internet company
is so confident about its high security email system that it is
offering 50,000 pounds (80,000 U.S. dollars) to anyone who can
hack it, New Scientist magazine reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The company, Global Markets Research, said that it has given
its 1on1 email service an added security feature using 2048-bit
public key encryption to keep the e-mail secure en route.
</P>
<P>
Called autoshredder, the function allows the user to set the
e-mail to delete itself from the recipient's computer a specified
amount of time after being opened.
</P>
<P>
The idea is to prevent e-mails that may contain confidential or
embarrassing material coming back to haunt you. This is what
happened to Microsoft's Bill Gates last year when he was forced to
defend himself against his own private e-mails in an antitrust
case.
</P>
<P>
The system takes precautions to ensure that the e-mail is not
stored anywhere within the recipient's computer, and when it
auto-deletes the message the system overwrites it so as not to
leave any trace that could be undeleted later.
</P>
<P>
Global Market Research said the encryption on its 1on1 service
is unbreakable within a reasonable period of time, and this is why
it is offering 50,000 pounds to anyone who can hack into a message
within three months.

<HEADLINE> Dow Jones Shoots to Record High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, August 25 (Xinhua) -- The Dow Jones industrial
average moved into the new record territory Wednesday one day
after the Federal Reserve raised interest rates to preempt
inflation from the U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
The blue chip index closed up 42.74 at 11,326.04, surpassing
the record closing high of 11,299.76 set Monday.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were mostly higher. The Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index rose 18.29 at 1,381.79 and the technology heavy
Nasdaq composite index rose 53.23 at 2,805.60.
</P>
<P>
Investors rushed into the market as they were in a firm belief
that the Federal Reserve's action on the rates would keep
inflation under control and sustain the bull market.
</P>
<P>
The market was also moved higher by the hike in bond prices.
The rising pushed the yield on th 30-year Treasury bond down to
5.86 percent, its lowest level in almost three months, and made
stocks more attractive.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE index rose 6.08 at 639.96 and the Russell 2000 index
of smaller companies rose 0.74 at 437.86. But the American Stock
Exchange index fell 3.54 at 785.88.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 10-to-9 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,599 up, 1,429 down and 508
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
NYSE volume increased to 840.82 million shares from 719.01
million in the previous session.

<HEADLINE> Marion Jones' Dream Ended in Disaster </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEVILLE, August 25 (Xinhua) -- American star runner Marion
Jones has waited for two years for a historical moment of a sprint
double at World Athletics Championships, but her dream was ended
in disaster in two seconds..
</P>
<P>
Jones, who won the 100 meters on Sunday, pulled up in agony in
the middle of the 200m semi-final Wednesday night and collapsed on
the track before being rushed off to the medical centre for
treatment on a stretcher.
</P>
<P>
Her husband C.J. Hunter, shotput champion in Seville who was
watching from the stands, dashed down and walked in front of the
stretcher as it was wheeled to the medical center inside the
stadium,where she was examined by two doctors.
</P>
<P>
"It's her back," Jones's manager Charlie Wells said outside of
the medical center.
</P>
<P>
Wells added: "We as yet do not know what is going wrong with
her. We will make further examination before we can confirm
anything."
</P>
<P>
Arne Ljungqvist, the International Amateur Athletics Federation
medical commission chief, said: "I don't think it's anything
serious. I think it's probably nothing alarming."
</P>
<P>
U.S. team offical Jennifer Tilder, on behalf of Jones' manager
Charlie Wells and her doctors, said in a press conference that
Jones sustained an injury on her low back.
</P>
<P>
"While coming out of the turn in tonight's semifianl of the 200
meters, Marion Jones experienced spasm and cramping in her lower
back. She is currently undergoing treatment and further
examinations to determine the full extent of her condition."
</P>
<P>
Jones, won made her name at the last World Championships by
winning 100m in Athens two years ago, had just entered the home
straight when she visibly began to slow Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
She grimaced in pain, put her left hand to the small of her
back and stopped before falling prostrate with the finish line in
sights.
</P>
<P>
"It's a tragic. In my eyes she is the wonder woman of track and
field," said Australian sprinter Nova Peris-Kneebone.
</P>
<P>
"She's gained so much respect, it's very sad for her. I'd have
loved to have seen Marion win the gold in 200. It would have been
an incredible achievement because she's admired around the world,"
said the Australian.
</P>
<P>
Fellow sprinter Chandra Sturrup of the Bahamas said Jones
looked unconfortable before the start of the race.
</P>
<P>
"I could see she was in trouble before we got down on the
blocks. She was rubbing her back," she said.
</P>
<P>
Jones had come to Seville with a target of a record breaking
four gold medals, but it was shattered when she could only manage
a bronze in the long jump on Monday.

<HEADLINE> Sean Elliot Released from Hospital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Sean Elliott, a star member
of the NBA championship winning team San Antonio, was released
from a hospital Wednesday, nine days after a kisney transplant
operation in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
The 31-year-old veteran forward smiled and waved to a few fans
when he left Methodist Specialty and Transplant Hospital.
</P>
<P>
Elliot offered a lunch for nurses involved in his operation
Tuesday and signed autographs for hospital workers Wednesday. "It
is happy to be going home," he said.
</P>
<P>
The 10-year player underwent the operation on August 16,
receiving a kidney from his elder brother Noel, a 32-year-old
sales associate.
</P>
<P>
Noel pushed Sean Elliott out of the hospital in a wheelchair in
Wednesday's afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Sean needed the transplant because of a condition known as
focal segmental glomerular sclerosis.
</P>
<P>
Another brief surgery was required Saturday to make sure
Elliott's new kidney was properly connected and working.
</P>
<P>
Now Elliott will embark on months of recuperation that probably
will determine whether he will play again in the NBA.

<HEADLINE> Scottish Scientists to Search for Genetic Laziness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 25 (Xinhua) -- Scientists in Scotland are
launching a study to find out if being lazy is in the genes, The
Independent newspaper said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Researchers from Glasgow University believed that pinpointing a
"lazy" gene could eventually lead to therapies which increase the
desire for exercise and improve health.
</P>
<P>
Professor Susan Ward, who is leading the project, said that the
study would focus on links between genetic components in the body
and exercise intolerance.
</P>
<P>
According to Professor Ward, people who don't like exercise are
usually seen as lazy, but it may be that it's not their fault and
there may be a link between exercise intolerance and genetic
make-up which restricts or promotes exercise depending on people's
genes.
</P>
<P>
She said previous research with fruit flies had found that some
were genetically predisposed to "sitting" while others, known as
"rovers", were more active.
</P>
<P>
"If we can establish a certain genetic pattern which
corresponds to what is commonly seen as laziness it could
transform the way we deal with health problems caused through lack
of exercise." she was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, Professor Ward stressed that factors such as
environment and the body's physical characteristics could also
have an impact on exercise.
